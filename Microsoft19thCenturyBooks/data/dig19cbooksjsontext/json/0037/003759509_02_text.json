Harmony had been restored to the kitchen, and the roof now echoed to the sounds of honest mirth. And what a kitchen that was for Christmas Eve ! Brass and tin, copper and pewter, on wall or dresser shone and gleamed like metallic eyes staring the yule-log out of countenance, and glistened, or winked, or twinkled as the blaze leaped up or fell in fitful flashes. High overhead hung huge flitches, heavy hams, bunches of herbs, and ropes of thin-necked onions ; suggestive of savoury rashers yet uncut, and ducks or geese some day to be stuffed and cooked, though then waddling about the farm. And what a forest of evergreens ! Ivy had need to be plentiful around the Grange to supply the quantity within it ; VOL. II. B"], [10, "2 god's providence house. and no pains had been spared to deck the large kitchen becomingly. As though the red berries of the holly were insufficient, the ivy buds had been dipped in whiting or indigo, and turnips or cajTots, cut into curious flowers, stuck here and there indis- criminately. A tin sconce above the mantleshelf held the Christmas candle, of gigantic proportions, which flared away in silence opposite to the grim clock, as if to show how brazen-faced the noisy time recorder was, to wag its pendulous tongue in weary warnings on a night like that. And deaf to its own story, the aged clock monotonously and ceaselessly said \" Going, gone ! going, gone ! going, gone !\" though no one listened, and no one cared ; so with its hands before its face it went on checking off the irrecoverable minutes with a sort of desperate earnest ness, and a wail for mortal heedlessness. How many scrubbings, how much beeswax and labour had been given to the long, white table (now loaded with good things), to the -oak chairs, clock, and settle, the saucy-looking snap-table, and even the chequered floor, polished until the red tiles seemed to smile from amongst their black brotherhood at the scarlet holly-berries and say, \"Ah! it's all very well for you to come once a year with your Christmas bloom, but we keep our colour all the year round,"], [11, "CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. 3 so you'll not put us out of countenance with your florid cheeks ; and though we are trampled under foot we rather like it, and we shall be well cared for when you are cast behind the fire as useless rubbish. So shine away, pretty holly, during your twelve days' reign, we are not at all afraid of you.\" But the crowning glory of the kitchen was the mistletoe-bough, dependent from the centre of the raftered roof, on which the combined genius of men and maids had been concentrated. Not a bush to be spanned by a pair of long arms \u2014 three or four pairs could scarce have clasped it. And there the mistletoe, with lip-like leaves kiss ing the waxen berries, held a prominent place, and tempted other lips to \" go and do likewise.\" Then round the kissing emblem was clustered a circle of protecting holly with its bright red dots ; round and above that the friendly ivy spread its glossy green with umbels of olive or blue or white. Apples and oranges, like golden balls, brightened and scented this radiant bough, like the famous fruit of the Hesperides ; but there was no fiery dragon to guard the treasure, \u2014 the prickly firs and holly alone stood sentry, and bristled their spears about it to keep off unkissed lips. And there the yule-log spluttered and blazed anil b 2"], [12, "4 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. crackled, and the bright flame leaped about it in vain efforts to reach its hard heart, and make it glow through its whole length and breadth. But brighter and more cheery than the fire, or floor, or furniture, or platters, or pans, or winter berries, were the bright eyes and cheerful faces assembled there, in which all these bright things were reflected and grew brighter. Dick and Ben, rejoicing in new smock-frocks (Mrs. Ford's Christmas gifts), with smoothly-shaven chins, their lower limbs encased in grey woollen hose fresh from their sweethearts' knitting-pins, the heavy clogs in daily use replaced by their Sunday shoes, sat, one on each settle, as lords of the place, laughing and joking with their fellows, the hinds, who in clean smock-frocks, with wives or daughters also in holiday trim, had come, according to custom, to share the Christmas cheer and sports under their master's roof. The three maid-servants, discarding their gingham or linsey gowns and grogram petticoats, were radiant as rainbows in dresses of brightly-printed linen, tucked up behind to show the quilted camlet skirts. Their coloured stays of coloured leather, stitched (like the men's smocks) in fanciful devices, confined over the bosom modest kerchiefs, white as their linen caps and aprons, or the snow without. Brass buckles spanned their insteps, calling attention to the neatly-"], [13, "CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. 5 fitting stockings each girl's own deft fingers had produced. In the corner nearest the fire, seated on a chair (to make room for which a settle had been pulled back), sat a Shotwick villager, little Job Last, who played the big fiddle in Shotwick Church. By dint of much cajolery on the part of Dick, Ben, and Feggy, who had been in a body to impress him that afternoon, he had been prevailed on to bring himself and his fiddle to the Grange. It had been a troublesome task, (not the bringing of the fiddle, but the man), for he had a wholesome dread of all spirits that were not drink able ; but Peggy quenched his fears with the assur ance that all ghosts or evil spirits lost their power on Christmas Eve, and only good angels were abroad ; so there he was, ready to fiddle for their amusement and to feast for his own. They had brought him with them, lest his courage should fail. When the party from the drawing-room presented themselves at the door, Betty and Sally were bustling about coucocting the egged ale and concomitants, whilst Peggy, with her back towards that entrance, stood before the fireplace, helping Dick to remove a heavy pot which hung suspended from the iron crane over the sire. As they entered, and were observed, the noise of tongues subsided only to rise in clamorous greetings,"], [14, "6 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. in which \"Merry Christmas\" and \"Happy New- Year, an' many on 'em,\" with the names of \" Mester and Mistress Ford, an' Miss Ailse, an' Mester Yawood \" (his name was pretty well known and his errand there also), blended in a confused chorus of good wishes and good will. The delighted yeoman, well-pleased, went round from one to another, shaking each rough hand in turn, patting rosy cheeks, and complimenting matrons on their own good looks or those of their growing girls ; enquiring after the children left at home, and the grannies left with them, with a cor diality which went straight to their homely hearts. \"What is that, Feggy?\" enquired he, as that damsel, with a bunch of mistletoe in her hands, followed into the yard Dick and Ben, who bore between them the immense iron pot steaming from the fire. \" Th' mistletoe-mash for th' pigs, , Sur,\" was her reply, as she passed out ; and this Mr. Ford explained to his town-guest, was believed by Peggy, and other country people, to be an infallible preservative of the swipe throughout the ensuing year from all diseases to which pigs were liable, excepting, of course, that sudden sore throat from which most fat porkers died. It consisted of a warm mash of potatoes and oatmeal, given on Christmas Eve, with a sprig of mistletoe in every trough ; and he observed, laughingly, that as"], [15, "CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. 7 it did their hogs no harm, and satisfied Peggy's super stitious scruples, he let the lass have her way ; and, so long as her superstitions were harmless, he should not interfere with her, for she was a faithful and good servant ; and he felt bound to overlook such little constitutional defects. Her sweetheart, he said, whom he had taken as a boy and brought up on the farm, was not so considerate, and quarrels not unfrequently resulted from Dick's ridicule of her notions. The egged ale being ready, it was handed round with roasted apples, toast and cake, and then (the other settle being also pushed back) a wooden trencher was produced, and a game of forfeits commenced, in which all took part ; Mr. Ford enjoying the fun as much as any of the lads and lasses about him. Even Mr. Heywood condescended to dazzle the eyes of the rustics like a brilliant meteor, and soon seemed very much at home amongst them ; but the mistletoe bough hung overhead, and Alice's lips looked tempt ing, cold as they were to him. As for Alice, some thing in her father's eye brought her back as she was retiring from the kitchen on the appearance of the trencher, and, powerless to resist, she resigned herself to the chances of the game with what com posure she could ; consoling herself that her compli ance with Christmas usance could not be construed by Mr. Heywood into open encouragement."], [16, "GOD'S PROVIDEXCE HOUSE. 8 The trencher was turned, and first \" My lady went off in a very great hurry, and called for \" Dick or Ben, or Mr. Yawood or Hobnail, as the case might be, and \"My gentleman went off\" in a similar hurry, and called for the petticoat that pleased him best ; and so it went round, with sundry slips on the polished floor, and mirth and laughter in every corner. Then the forfeits were redeemed. Mrs. Ford \"cried,\" whilst Mr. Ford awarded; and there was much scrambling and kissing, crushing of ker chiefs and rumpling of hair ; the mistletoe-bough became denuded of its fruit, and amidst it all (as though the blindfolded awarder knew well what he was about, and took a sly pleasure in mischief), Alice and Mr. Heywood were called together under the mistletoe with a certainty and frequency never the result of chance, and no frowns of hers could dissipate the broad satisfaction visible in the countenances of both father and lover. The last of the forfeits redeemed, more ale and cake went round ; Job Last tuned his fiddle, and scraped away something that was meant for a country dance, and the motley guests stood up in couples. Mr. and Mrs. Ford leading, Alice and Mr. Heywood following; then Dick and Peggy, Betty and Ben, Sally and some one else ; and though Vestris would have shrugged his shoulders alike at figure and steps,"], [17, "9 CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. the country dance was footed in true country fashion, and only finished when breath was short, and a fiddle-string broke. The ladies and gentlemen retired to supper in the long room when the dance was over, leaving their gratified servants to their own sports and enjoyments ; there were more games, more dancing ; cbesnuts and apples were roasted, bowls of furmety were served out and swallowed, a huge cheese cut into, and a Christmas pie ; more ale was brought from the cellar, and then the edibles were cleared away for a last dance. And as Mr. Ford, with his arm round his wife, led the way upstairs after supper, followed by Alice and Mr. Heywood, the bells of Shotwick Church pealed out upon the night wind over the moonlit snow a welcome to Christmas, with all its hallowing in fluences. \" It is remarkable,\" said Mrs. Ford, after a pause, listening to the chimes, \" that we have had neither waits nor carol-singers near our doors this year. I never knew a Christmas to pass without them before.\" \"Nay,\" answered Michael, smiling, \"you forget, Margaret, we are not at Ford-brook. No doubt there has been carolling enough before the parson's, and at Latham Lodge; but I question if all the"], [18, "10 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. pence in your pockets, or cakes in your cupboards, would tempt boy or girl to sing carols or anything else before the Grange after dusk. I hope to make a change, however, before the year comes round. It shall go hard but I will convince the boobies that the Grange is as safe and desirable as the Lodge or the Parsonage, and more hospitable than either.\" \" Old prejudices are hard to root out, Mr. Ford,\" suggested Mr. Heywood, with a strange expression in his undefinable eyes. \" I fear you have undertaken more than you will easily accomplish.\" \" I do not expect to do it easily, Robert, but I mean to do it nevertheless. I am not going to be balked by an old woman's story, I can tell you. Ghost or no ghost, I'll cultivate the grounds, and live at the Grange, and defy the Devil himself to drive me out ! \" and down came Michael's clenched hand like a hammer on the mahogany as a sort of knock-down argument. How peculiar were the lights and shadows flitting over Mr. Heywood's face during this declaration of determined will ! Was he thinking how much better the estate would be when in course of time it came into his bands? or what ? His reply was simply, \"Resolute will may accomplish much, my dear sir; and perhaps when the clodhoppers see or hear that yourself and family live here in quiet, undisturbed"], [19, "CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. 11 by nocturnal visitations, you may find them easier to manage, and the Grange grow into better repute.\" \" So I hope,\" said Michael, but nothing was added of the stained floor or the pattering feet. Probably he felt ashamed to confess the possibility of disturb ance to Mr. Heywood. Much of this discourse had been lost on Alice, who had been in and out, providing materials for the manufacture of punch, together with a large china bowl and silver ladle, to contain and distribute the delectable beverage, which Mr. Ford compounded with a skill which bespoke long practice. Alice again sat down to the harpsichord, and carolled a Christmas hymn whilst the bells were ringing merrily, and laughter mingled with music ascended from the kitchen. Then the deep voices of the clocks told midnight, and ere the last tone died away, the glasses clinked, and Christmas was ushered in with warm words and wishes, and a voiceless prayer went up from one heart for reunion with the absent one so loved and loving. Once more Mr. Ford and Margaret sought the kitchen, desiring their daughter to remain and enter tain their guest As they entered at one door, Peggy, with one or two companions, came in at another, from an expedition to the shippons, in hopes to see the oxen kneeling in their stalls at midnight"], [20, "12 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. in mysterious adoration ; but they seemed to come in with disappointed looks, although faith itself was unshaken. More hot ale and cake ! The healths of master and mistress, the young lady and young gentleman (coupled strangely together) were drank, and one by one the merry-makers departed, some with very unsteady feet, and oddly revolving heads. But home they got somehow, the sober helping their less for tunate companions to plod or stumble through the snow on their several ways to their scattered dwell ings. Job Last remained behind to sleep in Dick's room for the night, as an alternative less dreadful than passing through the haunted grounds at that hour. If Mr. Ford, in leaving Alice behind with Mr. Heywood, had any lurking intention of gaining his favourite an opportunity to plead his passion betimes, the little artifice failed. Mr. Heywood dreaded nothing so much as an open repulse, a decisive rejec tion, and was too wary to invite it in the mood Alice was then in. Secure of her father's favour, he felt that his best policy was to bide his time, and disarm her opposition by respectful attentions as far removed from persecution as possible. Every chance the season might present he would seize, as any warm friend might ; but he must make his love seen and felt, rather than give it words \u2014 as yet."], [21, "CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. 13 So his conversation with Alice was on indifferent topics : the Christmas customs of the country, with which he professed himself unacquainted, and news from the outer world, of which she knew so little and he so much ; and so far removed from obtrusion were his manner and discourse that imperceptibly her reserve thawed, she forgot her suspicions, and Michael returned to find her conversing freely with the man from whom she ran away only a few hours before. But that was a drowsy hour at the Grange, so the fires and candles were extinguished for the preserva tion of the relics, and the household one and all retired to repose ; Mr. Heywood, as he bade good night, raising the hand of Alice to his lips, with a longing, lingering look in which there was, oh ! how much of regret, and self-reproach, and tenderness, and intense but respectful admiration. People who sit up after midnight are seldom dis posed to rise before daybreak, and heavy potations of egged ale are strongly soporific ; so the kine had been lowing for the milkers long ere the heavy heads were lifted from the pillows. How much longer the cows might have lowed unheeded by the sleepers cannot now be determined ; but it is certain the latter were roused from Christmas-haunted dreams by sounds which reverberated through the house like thunder. Some one was plying the ponderous knocker with"], [22, "14 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE, vigorous strokes, and down came the blows with a ceaseless beat, like a hammer upon an anvil. Hud dling on their clothes, with little shivers in the raw morning air, the half-awake servants hurried down to the hall ; Peggy, very imperfectly dressed, reaching the door in great trepidation, just in time to arrest the hand of Dick as he withdrew the last bolt and was about to throw it open. But Peggy, fearing to permit either a woman or a light-haired man first to cross the threshold on that sacred morning, interposed with a quick \" Stop, Dick, lad ; dunna thee oppen till tha knows who's theer ! \" and stooping to the keyhole after removing the key, she applied first her eye, and then her mouth, and bawled through the orifice, \" Who's theer ? Whatn's yo'r neame ? \" putting her ear down imme diately to catch the reply. \" Whoi, oim Mat Spark, an' oi come to let th' Christmas in ; so oppen th' dur, and dunna mak a fuss ! \" was the answer, in a very thick and important voice. \" Hes black eneugh, anny how, so oppen th' dur, Dick, and let th' luck in,\" said Peggy, quite con tent, continuing, \" Hadn it bin thatn loight-headed wheelroight, he moightn a gone back the road he came; he shouldna come in here a' th' Christmas mearn.\" So Peggy being agreeable, the door was"], [23, "CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. 15 unbolted, and Matthew Spark entered somewhat un steadily, first kicking the snow off his heavy shoes. He had been at Latham Lodge overnight, and instead of going home to bed, had joined a few congenial souls (or bodies) at the Black Bear, and when pretty well primed, been dared by his drunken companions to let Christmas in at the Grange, a feat his Dutch courage had enabled him to accomplish. \" Oi wish yo' a merry Christmas an' a happy New Year ! \" was his ready salutation, responded to very heartily on all hands as he was led in triumph to the kitchen ; where, as soon as the scarcely cold fire was rekindled, he was regaled with the customary hot ale \u2014 cheese and bread being substituted for the less solid cake. The combined effects of his night's carouse, the hot ale, and warm fire, soon sent the smith to sleep, and he lay at full length on the settle, with his mouth wide open, snoring loudly, whilst the maids removed the remains of the feast, all stains and signs of last night's revels, and prepared the morning meal. There he still lay, when Mrs. Ford and Alice came down to breakfast, and so might have remained until noon, had not little Job Last, before he took his own de parture, given the burly smith as good a shake as he could manage, and asked if he did not mean to go to church on good Christmas-day, instead of snoring"], [24, "god's TROVIDENCK HOUSE. 16 4r there like a hog. And when at length roused, he re membered au appointment with exacting Ph\u0153be : so hurried off to keep it. very little ashamed of his inebriety, although he had not even thou slept off its effects. The unusually late breakfast\u2014 deferred as much in deference to the presumed habits of their guest, as to the sleepy heads consequent on late hoars \u2014 pre cluded the possibility of the projected nimble over house and grounds ; (some time being occupied by 31 r. Ford in the distribution of gifts), absence from church on Christmas Day being out of the question. Indeed. Mrs. Ford was ready before the bells began to ring, arrayed iu the full glory of the new Lyons silk, in compliment to the giver (who did not forgot to thank her for the honour she had done him), with a brilliant scarlet cloak, a fox-skin ruff and muff. warm mittens, and. to crown all, the hideous black silk hat, originally designed to cover that other mon strous excrescence \u2014 a toupee \u2014 but now worn without any other reason than long usage. Alice, also red cloaked, but more becomingly hatted, her hands and cheeks reposing in those delicate beds of swans'-down called muff and ruff, stepped with arched instep into the room, blooming in the frosty morning, with the warm hope in her heart of meeting George Latham, and exchanging a reassuring greeting however brief."], [25, "CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. 17 Did Mr. Heywood interpret her thoughts when he scanned her with such curiously penetrating glances ? or were his looks only those of intense admiration blent with anxiety? Both, perhaps. The bells rang out their Christmas peal through the clear air across the whitened fields, as Mr. and Mrs. Ford, Alice and Mr. Heywood, passed out at the gates, treading down the crisp snow under their feet ; and the sly old griffins looked as though they could have told some wonderful secrets had they been so disposed, but they kept their tongues in their heads, and whatever secrets they might possess, maintained a grim silence under their new white winter robes. Alice glanced \u2014 as she passed the wicket \u2014 under the trees along the plantation path she had traversed so happily, and Mr. Heywood's eyes followed hers ; but there was nothing visible save a robin and his mate hopping across the narrow way in hungry search for an early dinner. The firs and cedars might have been traps to catch the snow, so thickly was it embedded in their dense foliage ; and even in the network tracery of deciduous trees, it rested in thick white patches, lit into sparkles by the round red sun. Snow lay every where, heaped high atop of the dark stone walls, like Parian coping, drifted like white fleece between the interstices of the masonry, thick on the roadway, now down-trodden and hard ; round roots of trees and VOL. n. c"], [26, "18 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. over grassy knolls ; and on the wood-path, and there, white, and clear, and cold, it lay unprinted by a human foot. No one had trod that path since that snow fell ! and Alice sighed, as her transient glance took in all this. George Latham was not at church. Ph\u0153be was there, Dame Wood and her attentive son, and even Matthew Spark\u2014 sobered by sundry plunges of his hot head into a pail of cold water ; but the Latham pew was empty. The bloom faded from Alice's cheek, and the bright hopes out of her heart, as the service proceeded and the pew remained vacant. He bad expressed an intention to be there, and scrutinize his rival nar rowly, actuated to suspicion by the letter which had fallen into his hands ; and wherefore he had failed to keep his tryst, she could not surmise. Probably he was too late \u2014 he might be waiting in the porch ; so she strove to recall her wandering thoughts to the service. But, though she joined in the Christmas anthem, \" Christians, awake ! \" the voice was not an echo of the theme in her heart ; and albeit, her eye during the sermon glanced from pew to pulpit, from pillar to altar, the profuse decoration of the building made no impression on the brain. Cartloads of evergreens had been wreathed and grouped in tasteful combination over every available point, converting the old country"], [27, "CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. 19 church into a perfect winter bower ; but Alice heeded not \u2014 neither did she note how much more conversant was Mr. Heywood with the Liturgy than when he stood beside her in Northwich Church, though she had recalled his bewilderment that Sunday on her way hither. Little did he think of the inutility of labour devoted to a false aim, when he studied the day's ritual for the sole purpose of impressing Alice with a better opinion of the state of his feelings on the subject of religion. Not iu the porch \u2014 not in the churchyard ! Little knots of people clustered here and there in earnest conversation ; but the only one to whom Alice could have put a question had tripped away with Matthew Spark, as though there were no other interests than their own in all Shotwick, and the shade which had overspread Alice's brow, deepened and sank into her heart, with a presentiment of evil. There was, however, no shade on Michael's face ; to him Mr. Latham's unwonted absence from church suggested the possibility of a degree less eagerness in the pursuit of an unattainable bride ; never thinking \u2014 short-sighted man \u2014 of the thousand and one chances to detain even a lover away from church, or his mistress, one day out of the three hundred and sixty-five. And Mr. Heywood, notwithstanding his presumed ignorance of all around him, looked on the c 2"], [28, "20 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. empty pew with a gratification far exceeding Mr. Ford's, and with a consequent exuberant flow of spirits exerted himself, though ineffectually, to re move the depression gradually creeping over Alice, whom he watched with a keen, jealous, and anxious eye. As they approached the Grange, a chaise was driven through the gateway before them, and long before the church-goers reached the porch, its occu pants had alighted and stood expectant. Then en sued hand-shakings, \" merry Christmases,\" and intro ductions, ere Mrs. Wright, a buxom widow, Miss Wright, a fair young lady, and Mr. Dutton, a much fairer young gentleman, especially devoted to the young lady, were ushered upstairs. Mr. Heywood appeared slightly disconcerted by the stare with which Mrs. Wright honoured him on introduction ; but the discomposure was only momentary, and he was speedily chatting very agreeably to the lady and her daughter. Very shortly these guests were followed by others, for whom the hall-door had been left open, in utter disregard of the cold wind which, so challenged, felt at liberty to enter unannounced. Mr. Ford was there to receive their humbler, though not less welcome, friends, and there was no lack of cordiality in his congratulations. Miles Wood, timing his step to that"], [29, "CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. 21 of his aged mother, with his sister Jane, home for the day, had been the first comers ; but they were passed at the gates by Matthew Spark, bright as a butterfly, with red and yellow vest, and face dyed to match, and by sparkling little Ph\u0153be who leaned on his proud arm, more entrancing than ever, and too en grossed with thoughts of herself and her beau to spare more than a passing glance and word to Miles, whose good heart felt more keenly the neglect of his mother and sister than her coldness to himself. Job Last and his indispensable fiddle, brought up the rear, with two or three young people from Shotwick, whose names it is not necessary to record. One and all, however, received a hearty Christmas welcome from the worthy Cheshire yeoman, \u2014 a man given to hos pitality, and never more delighted than when engaged in contributing to the delight of others. Prompted by a secret longing for news of George Latham \u2014 scarcely admitted to herself \u2014 Alice followed closely on the heels of her father ; ostensibly to second his honest welcome ; and really so, for it must be conceded she was seldom remiss in her observance of the duties of hospitality ; and never on that anniver sary which, as it were, fuses the whole Christian world into one homogeneous mass, softens asperities, creates amenities, and binds men of different ranks and moulds into a common and blessed brotherhood."], [30, "22 god's providence house And, therefore, eager as she was for speech with Ph\u0153be, her first care, after showing the female visitors into her sitting-room (converted for the nonce into a cloak-room), was the venerable mother of Miles Wood ; but no sooner was the old dame divested of her outer habiliments, than Alice drew Ph\u0153be apart into the recessed window. Whatever inquiries she would have addressed to her were, however, fore stalled by Ph\u0153be placing a small package in her hands, and whispering, disjointedly, \"Mr. Latham was at Chester yesterday \u2014 did not get home till late \u2014 couldn't possibly be at church this morning \u2014 will write to-morrow.\" Some time after, in the privacy of her own chamber, whither she stole for the purpose, she opened the pre cious packet. It contained a small ivory miniature of her betrothed, drawn with rare skill and fidelity. The locket-back revealed one of his ebon curls, and round the rim she read, with moistened eyes, the simple words, \"George to Alice, Christmas, 1790.\" A fine gold chain, of delicate workmanship, completed as graceful and acceptable a love-token as could well be presented. If the kisses were hasty which she pressed on the unanswering lips, ere she threw the chain around her neck, and hid the miniature close to her warm heart, they were, at all events, as fervent as her lover could have wished ; and the light that sparkled"], [31, "CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. 23 in her eye the remainder of the day, told how intense was her satisfaction and delight. Enveloped in a linen overgo wn, for the protection of the Lyons silk, was Mrs. Ford during this time, busy as a bee in her own quiet orderly way, directing the dinner-arrangements. In the long parlour two or more tables had been joined to supply a board of suf ficient length for host and hostess ; guests, gentle and simple ; servants, both men and maids, to sit down and dine together, and that without so much as the salt-cellar distinction of feudal times. True, the servants occupied the end nearest to the kitchen \u2014 but for convenience, not distinction \u2014 while Mrs. Wright and her daughter held the post of honour (if such there were) on either side of Mr. Ford, in the light of the large bay-window ; Mr. Duttton not being driven far from his lady-love. With the double de sign of marking the relation between Alice and Mr. Heywood, and placing all at the festive board that day on an equal footing, Michael had contrived to seat them opposite to each other, midway down the table, in the midst of the villagers, a distinction as agreeable to Robert as it was annoying and painful to her. On the glossy white napery, kept in lavender for such solemn occasions, and on the best willow-pattern dinner-service, was spread a bountiful supply of Christ-"], [32, "24 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. mas dainties. The fat porker killed during the past week furnished the boar's head, which, with rosemary in eyes and ears, and a lemon in its jaws, occupied the centre of the table, as the chief dish of the day ; notwithstanding the noble presence of sirloin, or turkey, or goose, or Christmas pie, or the scarcely less important matters of fowls and game. It is needless to recount the fabulous piles of vegetables that disappeared, as concomitants of these savouries, when the green-handled two-pronged knives and forks began to rattle over the Chinese birds, boats, bridges, pagodas, and willows of the well-supplied plates. Nor would it be wise or fair to measure all the home-brewed ale that leapt and frothed from huge cans into glass, or silver, or pewter that day. A savoury steam filled the large apartment, pervaded with a combination of appetising odours, very grateful to the olfactory organs, when the other senses were as agreeably employed. As the carvers began to weary of their task, the green-hasted knives were plied less sedulously, and as the home-brewed vanished in copious libations, tongues were loosened, and, with the potent spell of the season upon them, conversation became merry and unrestrained. Then Mrs. Ford and her maids removed the ruins and skeletons, to replace them with mince-pies, custards, tartlets, cheese-cakes, apple-puffs,"], [33, "CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. 25 and a mammoth plum-pudding, covered with holly, and blazing in a sea of burnt brandy. This being the special contribution of Alice to the day's repast, she betrayed a little anxiety as to the success of her cookery, as all young cooks are wont to do ; but if the demands made upon it were to be taken as a criterion of its excellence, then was that plum-pud ding a decided achievement, and so Mr. Heywood assured her it was. Cakes and jellies and winter fruits followed when the cloth was withdrawn, home made wines and more ale filling up the measures of the Christmas feast, which had been already warmed and spiced with jest and mirth, healths and toasts, and such a genial, cordial, hearty welcome as only large, open, honest Christmas hearts like theirs could give. But remnants, china, glass, and tables removed, the polished oak floor denuded of its centre carpet, every crumb swept away, and the entertainment branched off in a fresh direction. Mr. Ford, beam ing and jolly, proposed a song \u2014 easy to propose, not so easy to obtain. After much persuasion, Miss Wright seated herself at Alice's old harpsichord, and astonished the ears of the rustics with a variety of most extraordinary shakes and quavers. Alice also sang, accompanying herself ; then, with some little reluctance, played an accompaniment for Mr. Hey-"], [34, "26 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. wood while he did his best to sing, \" Had I a heart for falsehood framed,\" and pointed his somewhat un musical effort with very tender and significant glances at the shy musician. Next Ph\u0153be, who had picked up music at school (as she had picked up many other things), from her schoolmates, who gave her secret lessons in return for little out-door favours, \u2014 Ph\u0153be ran her little fingers over the keys, and sweetly warbled the old ballad, \"Love me little, love me long,\" so archly, she drove the two enraptured swains to deeper depths of distraction, and won from tame Mr. Dutton such looks of undisguised admiration as brought a curl of scorn on the lip of his fair inamorata. Mr. Ford now insisted on a song from Miles ; whereupon Job Last, after setting all sensitive teeth on edge with tuning his fiddle, scraped the melody of a somewhat pathetic ballad, setting forth the cruelty of father, mother, sister, and brother, and of things animate and inani mate, which sundry and severally had ended in driving somebody's \" true love to sea \" \u2014 a lachrymose ditty articulated by INliles in true ballad fashion. Matthew, then, not to be outdone in the presence of Ph\u0153be, bespoke the services of Job, apparently used to the office, and sung out in a voice like the roar of his owrn forge, \" A wealthy young squoire in Tamworth did dwell \" \u2014 lingering with peculiar gusto"], [35, "CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. 27 on the final choice of the young lady of the ballad betwixt her two lovers. It was now Mr. Ford's turn, and with a palpable indication of sly humour in his eye, at the selection he had made of a theme, he trolled out in genuine earnestness, \"There was a jolly miller lived on the river Dee.\" In due order, the fair haired Mr. Dutton joined the fair Miss Wright in a duet, abounding in \" loves \" and \" doves,\" \" hearts \" and \" darts,\" \" fears \" and \" tears,\" sentimentally arranged for the especial behoof of lackadaisical lovers of both sexes. Mr. Heywood, again appealed to, essayed \"The Thorn,\" but made a sad break down ; and then, while one of the nameless villagers caused the room to ring again with a grand \" Tol-de rol \" chorus, in which everybody joined, or affected to join, tea was introduced for the daintier guests, and buttermilk and more ale supplied for less luxuri ous palates. During the tour of the seaboard with its Chinese freight, Mrs. Wright, who had sat some time in a brown study, remarked to Mr. Ford that Mr. Hey wood strongly resembled some one she knew \u2014 so strongly, indeed, they might be twin brothers ; and Michael, turning round and addressing Mr. Heywood, who was then, plate in hand, bestowing polite atten tion upon the young ladies, exclaimed, \" Robert, Mrs. Wright is quite struck with your resemblance"], [36, "28 god's PROVIDENCE HOUSE. to a friend of hers.\" \u2014 \" Oh, dear no ; not a friend \u2014 a person I knew by sight \u2014 not a friend, by any means ! \" was the lady's hasty interruption. Sir. Heywood, smoothing away an involuntary frown from his white receding forehead,' stepped forward, jauntily balancing his cup and saucer as he came, and observed with easy indifference, and a slight shrug of his shoulders, \" I presume your friend is a native of Chester, since I have frequently had the honour of being mistaken for a person there \u2014 some times very unpleasantly. The powder in my perriwig, I suppose, favours the resemblance ; for, if I mistake not, my second self, as you would call him, is as light complexioned as our young friend here.\" He said this with a graceful inclination of the head, and a wave of the hand towards Mr. Dutton, adding, \" Whilst I, you may perceive,\" pointing to his silky eyebrows and lashes, \" am decidedly dark.\" \"So I see,\" said Mrs. Wright; \"but for all that the resemblance of features and figure is singularly striking. With face and figure, however, the like ness terminates ; for I must do you the justice, Mr. Heywood, to say that the' young man to whom 1 refer is offensively rude and disagreeable, without manners or polish\u2014 anything but a gentleman.\" Michael laughed outright, and Mr. Heywood bowed low at the implied compliment, saying, \"It never"], [37, "CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. 29 was my fortune to meet the young gentleman with whom I have been so often identified. I should be glad to have that pleasure.\" \" It would be no pleasure, Mr. Heywood, for he is a sad reprobate ; and the less you know of him the better,\" was the widow's grave rejoinder. \"May be so; but I should be glad to meet with him nevertheless, if only to know what I am really like.\" Mrs. Ford coming up, curious to learn the engross ing topic of conversation, it was recapitulated by Mr. Heywood himself, in a light and easy manner, some thing between fluency and flippancy : and Alice, sitting near, watched his face, and listened to every word, with that old and unpleasant remembrance stealing over her once more. But the Christmas candles had been lit, more fuel piled on the fire, curtains drawn closer whilst the tea was being sipped, and now the sports of the evening commenced in good earnest. Dame AVood was care fully installed in an easy-chair in the bay of the window, whence she could see over the whole room, yet be herself out of the way. As on Christmas Eve, the mistletoe-bough was called into requisition for a game of forfeits, then the fiddle and harpsichord scraped and jingled together, while light-hearted, and both light and heavy footed, dancers kept the floor in a not particularly graceful bands across-"], [38, "30 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. and-down-the-middle country dance, in which stamp ing, plunging, and whirling alike set time and step at defiance. The sobriety of the minuet succeeded these rollicking rustic capers ; Mr. Dutton and Miss Wright stepping forward to bow and curtsey, rise and fall, sway backwards and forwards in slow and graceful stateliness, and impress the admiring crowd with a sense of drawing-room dignity. After a brief interval, a slipper was found and hunted with much noisy hilarity; and thereupon succeeded a second country dance, in which Ph\u0153be, being the pleased partner of Mr. Heywood, felt her own value so enhanced by his selection, that she tossed her head more disdainfully than ever, when Miles approached and asked her to become his partner in the next merry jig. She certainly tried his patience that evening ; but he was fortunately not so irritable as her more fiery admirer, who, now that he had supplemented the plentiful potations of Christmas Eve with strong draughts of Michael's home-brewed, was fast losing his self-command, and seemed inclined to exercise a right of dominion over the wayward maiden, which she was far from inclined to admit. Mr. Heywood, in Michael's hearing, solicited to be favoured with the hand of Alice for a minuet. An excuse rose to her lip \u2014 it was useless\u2014 the command"], [39, "CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. 31 in her father's eye enforcing compliance, although she felt every such concession to be treason to her alle giance to George. Ph\u0153be and her lover were of course set aside for a while ; and certainly if Robert Heywood had no voice, and was unable to sing, he was a master of the art of dancing, and if Alice (as her father was wont to boast) could \" dance a minuet with any girl in the county,\" the partner as surely knew how to show his lithe and elegant figure to the best advan tage in the various undulations of that graceful test of Terpsichorean skill. Buffet and side-tables had been loaded with cakes, oranges, apples, chesnuts, walnuts, trifle, and flum mery, and in the midst the prize punchbowl steamed an invitation to all comers to ply the silver ladle and fill and refill their glasses with the sweet and seduc tive beverage \u2014 an invitation by no means neglected. More games, more dances, more hornpipes and jigs, more country songs, more kissing under the mistletoe, in which Matthew, inspired by ale and punch, with a spirit, not of decorum, became uproarious, disordered Ph\u0153be's cap and kerchief more than she approved, and, to crown all, saluted Jane Wood immediately after with a fervour and roughness which not merely called for the interference of her brother, but roused the indignation of Miss Home, for flirts always like to keep the game to themselves."], [40, "32 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Alice and her friends had previously adjourned to the drawing-room, weary of the noise and rough manners of the countrymen, \u2014 many of them half drunk, \u2014 and were upstairs card-playing, when blind man's buff was proposed below. Dick, as blind man, was groping under and over chairs in search of Peggy, whose incessant laughter betrayed her whereabout, and Mr. Ford stood by the side of Dame Wood quietly listening to the praises of her son, remaining there to preserve the order endangered by the strength of his own ale and punch. Suddenly, as Dick caught his prize in his stout clasp, and passed his rough hand over her flushed face before he named her aloud, \u2014 suddenly there rang through the house a prolonged shriek or wail of despair: rushing foot steps swept along the corridor to the cheese-room overhead ; there was a heavy fall, and then \u2014 silence; \u2014 silence, soon broken by terrified cries of \" The ghost! the ghost!\" and the piercing screams of hys terical women. Mirth was over ; laughter ceased ; men and women, young and old, looked at each other with blanched faces, as if rooted to the spot; even Michael, lost his self-possession for the instant, but only for the instant. Snatching the nearest candle angrily, and exclaiming in a voice thick with passion, \" Some one has been playing a trick ; but let me only catch hold"], [41, "CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. 33 of the vagabond, and he'll rue it !\"\u2014 he darted from the room and up the grand staircase, two steps at a time, followed by his equally sceptical man, Dick. Peggy was in violent hysterics, Ph\u0153be in a quiet swoon ; as for the other women, none of them were sufficiently composed to render assistance at the moment. Miles, kneeling by the side of his dear Ph\u0153be, chafed her hands and cheeks, and strove, for some time in vain, to restore her to consciousness ; Jane and his mother, themselves trembling like leaves, standing by helpless. In another corner of the room, Peggy, alternately laughing and screaming, was undergoing a very summary course of treatment at the hands of Sally, who believed in vigorous slapping and shaking and pinching as infallible restoratives in all hysterical affections. Presently Michael and Dick returned, having found no one and seen nothing \u2014 a very unsatisfactory report to make to the congregated believers in the Grey Lady. Down, too, came Mr. Dutton and the ladies with very white faces, and up again went Michael and Dick, now accompanied by Matthew Spark \u2014 particularly valiant because particularly drunk \u2014 to institute another and more rigid search. This time every -*nook and corner was examined minutely; every closet or recess in which a person could possibly VOL. II. D"], [42, "34 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE, be hid ; under every bed, and behind every curtain they peered, but with the same result. \" Where is Mr. Heywood ? \" asked Michael on his return to the parlour : a question answered by that gentleman's appearance in the courtyard, when the kitchen-door was opened for the ghost-hunters to explore the outer buildings. He was walking briskly up the yard, where he said he had been taking a few turns to dissipate the fumes of ale and punch, so much more potent than he was in the habit of imbibing. Observing the air of stern and resolute determination on the countenance of Michael, and the scared faces of the men behind, with some wonder and anxiety he inquired what was the matter. Being briefly told, he proffered his services in the ghost-hunt ; but neither grey, black, nor blue lady could be found, nor even her cast-off garments, so they all returned to the house \u2014 Michael biting his lips with vexation, Mr. Heywood awed and sympa thetic, with the undefinable something in his eyes, which made Alice shrink in mistrust, and which Mr. Ford never saw. The fight had sobered all save Matthew, who was too far gone for that, and reeled and tumbled about to the thorough disgust of Ph\u0153be, who began to think Madam Latham's advice not very far wrono after all. Anxious to exhibit at once his zeal and"], [43, "CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. 35 his valour, he put his arm round her waist with noisy offers of protection, but pulled her over in his unsteady grasp. Miles hastening to her release, she clung to him as a safeguard against Matthew's into lerable roughness. With some difficulty the drunken fellow was restrained by Miles from following the women into the cloak-room ; and when the rest bade their host and hostess good night, anxious to depart from under a roof which held so terrible an inmate, Dick and Job jointly took charge of the smith, until Miles, proud of his trust, had guarded his mother and Ph\u0153be to a safe distance, committing Jane to a neighbour's care. But Matthew, not willing to resign Ph\u0153be to his rival, became abusive and pugilistic, making the hall a scene of wild disorder \u2014 drunkenness respecting neither place nor persons. Then his mood changed, his limbs relaxed, and he sank down on the floor in a state of sullen stupefaction. All this time there had been wellnigb as great commotion amongst the other guests, Mrs. Wright, in her superstitious terror (notwithstanding previous arrangements for some days' stay), insisting on returning home forthwith, and combating all inducements to remain where she was with the simple argument \" I dare not.\" Michael, annoyed and angry, had no alternative but to order the chaise to be horsed and brought round, D 2"], [44, "36 god's PROVIDENCE HOUSE. while Mr. Dutton and the ladies, hooded and cloaked. waited in the hall. But little Job Last, when the chaise came to the door, stepped timidly forward, and. with a shuffle \u2014 hat in hand \u2014 addressed the widow with\u2014 '\u2022 If so be. Madam, as oi may be so bold as to speak, oi would advoise yo to stay at th' Orange till mearn; th' road is na' safe after neeght-fa'.\" \"Aud why not, my good man?\" asked Mrs. Wright. \" There be hoighwaymen out,\" answered Job faintly. \"Highwaymen ! \" was the exclamation on all sides. \" Yoi \u2014 Mester Latham wor noigh killed by 'em last neeght, dom 'em ! \" \" Killed ! killed ! \" burst from a pair of white lips, and but for the ever-ready arms of her shadow, Mr. Heywood, Alice would have fallen to the ground ; while Job looked on aghast at the unexpected result of his announcement ; and Michael strode about in suppressed rage, inwardly cursing the Grange, the Lathams, Mrs. Wright, Job Last, aud everything about him. \" It was enough to drive a man wild,\" he said, \"to have his Christmas party broken up, and one-half his guests scared out of their senses in such a manner. There had been nothing but screaming1 and fainting for the last hour, and all owing to some infernal fool's mischief or other ! \""], [45, "CHRISTMAS AT THE GRANGE. 37 His expletives served neither to restore Alice nor to detain Mrs. Wright, whose fears of a spectre over came every sense of kindness or courtesy, and even her dread of highwaymen ; so she and hers drove off, apparently regardless of her young friend, removed so tenderly to the parlour by her solicitous suitor."], [46, "GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. 38 CHAPTER II. AND AT THE LODGE. For the twenty years during which the Grange had been abandoned to bats, and owls, and other midnight tenants, and for many a twenty years before that, Latham Lodge had been the seat of open-handed hospitality. During the dismal days of the Grenville ruin, when spiders spun their webs across the buttery-hatch, and owls roosted in the tireless chimneys, the Lodge became the centre of the district, its owners the representative gentry, ron whom devolved the pleasing duty of maintaining the English character for hospitality, liberality, and bene volence. Madam Latham, a noble specimen of an English country lady, did the honours of her son's house most worthily ! Her bounties were dispensed ungrudgingly, yet by no means lavishly ; provision for her guests was always ample, but never profuse ;"], [47, "AND AT THE LODGE. 39 no accessory to comfort or convenience was permitted to be wanting; but dissipation, waste, riot, extrava gance, or intemperance, were discountenanced and unknown. On the recurrence of the festivals of Easter and Christmas, in the name of her son, the lady still kept open house, and feasted guests of all classes. This year, the restoration of the Grange had raised up a rival hearth and table, and the guests, formerly sacred to the Latham board, were, con sequently, divided between the two houses for the Christmas festivities. However, the Lodge was duly decorated and provisioned, and on Christmas Eve the pantry stood a stout siege. The parson, of course, with his family and curate, were as of old the Latham visitors, and, with the exception of Job Last, the whole of the Shotwickers remained true to their old love. Still, one thing was wanting to make that holy eve as merry and exhilarating a festival as former Christmas Eves \u2014 and that want was great, George Latham was absent from the board ! He had gone early in the day \u2014 as his mother knew, for the minia ture not completed before \u2014 and at two, three, four o'clock had not returned. Presuming the artist or the goldsmith to have added one more delay to many, his mother imagined him detained by his business, and accordingly apolo-"], [48, "40 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. gized for his unwonted absence, never dreaming of disaster. Half-past four \u2014 five\u2014 and the bay filly that George Latham rode trotted up the drive over the silent snow unheard, and thence round to the stable door \u2014 but the saddle was vacant. Where was the good son of that agonized mother ? Where the master of that interrupted feast? Lying in the snow, four miles away, with a broken limb and a bullet wound. She saw nought but the empty saddle ; and what she imagined, only a mother's heart knows. There was a sudden rushing to and fro about the house, and men with lanterns hurried on foot down the drive and through the village \u2014 down Shotwick Lane to the Chester road, afraid of mounting, lest a horse's hoofs might crush the prostrate form of their dear master unawares. The obese and pompous parson, having no affection for bleak winter nights, or snowy roads, when snug quarters were at hand, remained to comfort the lady by the cosy fireside, and felt his place was there; while his curate \u2014 although without a great-coat \u2014 directed and joined the anxious search. There was little need of lan terns. The moon lit up the snow till every twig was visible ; and on \u2014 on the men hurried, fearful u-hat they might find, and how they might find it."], [49, "AND AT THE LODGE. 41 Eapidly their footsteps sped, hardening the snow as they crushed it down, but slowly enough, and too slowly for the man whose life-blood was oozing out, dying the virgin snow with crimson blushes. Anxiety grew with every traversed mile, one \u2014 two \u2014 three \u2014 almost four, and there, at the junction of the Park gate and Backford roads, lay the senseless form of George Latham, with his right leg doubled under him, and blood, which had trickled from a wound in his right shoulder, frozen on his drab coat. Well for him that the Kev. Mr. Gresham, the humane curate, was there, for in such emergencies the head to think and plan is as necessary as hands to execute. Miles Wood was despatched to the nearest farm for a blanket, and Tom to Chester for doctors, with brief but emphatic directions. No need to bid either messenger speed ; humble affection winged their feet, aud lightened heavy shoes. Meanwhile, Mr. Gresham slightly raised the un conscious head, moistened the livid lips with wine, which his precautionary forethought had provided, and bound his own handkerchief over the wounded shoulder. Fortunately, the intense cold had checked the hemorrhage, and probably saved the precious young life. Miles speedily returned with a couple of blankets, followed by the farmer and several of his men,"], [50, "GOD's' PROVIDENCE HOUSE. 42 equally curious and kind. They had heard a shot, but ascribed it to poachers, and thought no more about it. One blanket was wrapped round his body, the other spread as a litter, and George lifted into it as carefully as possible, wine having been first poured down his throat. Carefully as the wounded limbs were moved, the acute pain occasioned by the slightest motion caused him to groan deeply. That was the first sign of consciousness he had betrayed, and Mr. Gresham fervently thanked God when he heard the sound. The litter was swung between four men, who trod the road homeward with as much speed as was consistent with safety ; and Mr. Gresham desired Miles, as the most intelligent, and least likely to blunder or create unnecessary alarm, to push forward, allay the worst fears of Madam Latham, and have a bed prepared at once downstairs for the reception of the sufferer. Cautiously as Miles executed his painful mission, the intelligence he bore gave a shock to all who heard it; for though every possible evil had been conjectured and prognosticated, the confirmation of any one foreboding struck as chill to the heart as if the whole had been realized. Blows fall not the less heavily because anticipated. Madam Latham her self, tortured by suspense, felt certainly a relief; and, once assured that her son lived, although life hung on"], [51, "AND AT THE LODGE. 43 a thread, roused herself from the torpor of despair, and by her brave example stimulated to useful action those around her. There would be time enough for sorrow when hope was past, she said ; but tears, telling her own deep grief, stood in her sad eyes the while ; and when the mournful procession entered the Lodge at the back, to avoid the steep steps in front, they rolled in quick succession down her aged cheeks. \" He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow ; \" the son of her age, the sole surviving remnant of a large family ; and he lay before her, ghastly, blood-stained, and helpless, all unconscious of her sorrow or her tears. As desired, a bed piled on mattresses had been prepared, by her orders, in a room on the ground floor, and on this the insensible form of her beloved son was gently laid. A faint moan as his shattered leg touched the bed alone testified that life and consciousness of pain existed ; but not the first cry of his infant lips had been more grateful to the ear of the listening mother, when he was ushered into life, than the low sounds of mortal agony, wrang from the man in his dread struggle on the threshold of death. White and still there he lay, awaiting surgical aid. He had not to wait long. Horsemen soon overtake men on foot, burdened with such a load ; and almost"], [52, "44 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. as soon as George Latham was deposited on his tem porary bed, Dr. Wimslow and Mr. Prestbury ascended the steps and reached his side. The physician felt his pulse and looked grave ; the surgeon hastily examined the wound in the shoulder, and shook his head \u2014 unfavourable indi cations both ; but George was young, had a vigorous constitution, and might recover yet, despite the doctors. Ordering from the room all useless hands, the medical men proceeded to their task. Stimulants were at first administered as to a child, then the fracture was reduced, and, in as brief a space as could be well expected, the limb lay in a bed of tow and splints, until Nature, in her own good time, should kindly reunite the severed fragments. But so pro strate, so utterly exhausted was their patient, that it was deemed unadvisable to attempt the extraction of the bullet until some signs of reaction presented themselves. To produce this, recourse was again had to brandy, but, as at first it could only be administered through a quill, some time elapsed ere he had swallowed sufficient to produce a perceptible effect. When at length his opening eyes bespoke returning consciousness, a teaspoon was substituted for the quill, and the anxious mother, whom no argument or in ducement could tempt from his bedside, herself held the fluid to his blue lips."], [53, "AND AT THE LODGE. 45 Science at the present day, with all its instruments and appliances, would debate whether the probe or the bullet would be most likely to damage a comatose patient ; but those were days of rough surgery, and there was no lack of \" ball-practice,\" thanks to duellists and highwayman. Consequently, Mr. Prest bury went to work without loitering until another day, after George had revived sufficiently to speak and recognise his mother. That either George's arm had been raised at the time, or he had been fired at from beneath, was evident, the sleeve and flesh being ploughed upwards from the elbow to the shoulder in the track of the bullet, and there, in the muscles of the neck, it lodged. Fortunately for George it was not deeply embedded, and so the probe brought the destructive missile to light without much super fluous torture. The wound was dressed and bandaged with little more recourse to the stimulating spirit ; and then, after administering an anodyne, his medical attendants left the young man to the repose invited alike by the opiate and exhausted nature. That was a sad Christmas Eve at the Lodge. There was not a servant or a villager but loved Master George, and had loved him from boyhood to manhood ; not a hand but would have been raised in his defence, could the danger have been foreseen or averted ; and now that he lay maimed under the"], [54, "46 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. roof decked and prepared for the festal of hospitality, himself surrounded by beckoning shadows, and hover ing on the confines of the shadow-land, there was a hush upon the household \u2014 the silence of a great sorrow. Heavy-footed men pulled off their clouted shoes and trod the floors on tiptoe ; red-eyed women sobbed in secret corners, or hurried stealthily from room to room on little errands of love or usefulness. The feast was forgotten, the mistletoe disregarded. The rubicund parson, feeling himself of no account (Madam Latham being too anxious and too busy to sit and listen to his vapid conversation), took his departure, bearing with him his family, but leaving a worthy substitute in Mr. Gresham, who, true to his Christianity, remained to share the mother's night watch by the still bedside. Once, during his temporary return to conscious ness, George had murmured faintly the name of Alice, and that had recalled to Madam Latham the object of his errand to Chester. With a just percep tion of her son's unspoken wishes she with a sigh searched the pockets of his clothes (thrown hastily on the floor as they were cut from his injured limbs) for the miniature which had cost so much. This she intrusted to Th\u0153be, with strict injunctions not to exceed her verbal message by a word ; and on no account to suffer a hint of George's state to escape"], [55, "AND AT THE LODGE. 47 her lips. The same embargo was laid on the country people then in the Lodge; and the old animosity between the two houses being pretty well known, that was felt to be reason sufficient for silence \u2014 or, if not, the wish of the revered lady was. And duly wras the command obeyed : not even Mat Spark, in his drunken frenzy, uttering a hint about the matter. And even Job Last, who dropped the explosive news, broke no faith, being at the Grange on Christmas Eve, and having his information second-hand. It was no part of Madam Latham's practice to give a pang she could avoid to any human heart, and so she felt anxious to guard Alice from the great shock of such intelligence rudely conveyed. The bitter agony in her own breast assured her what must be the distress of Alice on learning the dangerous state of George : and as she sat in the darkened room, listening to his irregular and faint breathings, and to the rapid beat of his noisy hunting-watch, running itself down as fast as its young master, she pondered how best to break the mournful tidings to the young girl she had learned, for his sake, to love so well. As her eye rested on the patient and gentle companion of her vigil, she felt a fitter ambassador could not be found; and resolved to intrust to the Eev. Mr. Gresham the delicate task of acquainting Alice with all it was needful for her to"], [56, "48 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. know ; yet not so as to arouse Mr. Ford's prejudices. Then she thought how unassuming was the poor curate, and felt he would be likely to hesitate unless he had previously received an invitation to the Grange ; so in a low voice, she put the question to him, and finding to her satisfaction that her new neighbour had not overlooked the curate's cottage on s. o his way to the parsonage, decided on making Mr. Gresham her messenger, and consequently the con fidant of her son. Alas ! for that son, how might the morrow find him? What might be his state when the effects of the opiate died away ? Tick, tack \u2014 tick, tack \u2014 tick, tack, chattered the heedless watch, whilst the mother moistened the livid lips with a feather, or bent her head to catch his breathing. Tick, tack \u2014 tick, tack \u2014 tick, tack, cried the lively watch, as Mr. Gresham looked in its face to ask the time, and seated himself wearily to watch that other white face, and wonder if the eyes would open on Christmas Day in time or eter nity. Tick, tack \u2014 tick, tack \u2014 tick, tack, \u2014 the jubilant bells rang out their Christmas music, and the envious watch, unheard amid their clangour, ran down, and stopped. Madam Latham glanced hurriedly at her sleeping son ; for once the Christmas bells alarmed, and a look communicated her fears to the curate. There"], [57, "49 AND AT THE LODGE. was a hastily-whispered desire for the bells to be stopped, answered by a melancholy shake of the head, and an assurance that his immediate dismissal would follow any such daring innovation on his part. Then the old lady gliding noiselessly from the room, sent messengers to the Parsonage and ringers to beg-sflence for the sake of her son's life ; and while the pursy parson (aggrieved at being cheated out of his Christ mas revel) hummed and hawed, reflected and de bated, whether he dared to violate ancient custom and stop the bells before they had pealed the orthodox time \u2014 while he hummed and- hesitated, the chimes ceased their merry ding-dong suddenly, for the bell man had a tenderer heart than his master, and did not know of any ancient usage more powerful than humanity. When the last vibration died on the air there was silence in' the sick-room \u2014 silence unbroken, save by anxious pulses ; for the neglected watch, unwound. forgot its drowsy chant, and turned sulky. One by one the servants stole past the door with stealthy tread, as they retired for the night, Mrs. Emery, the housekeeper last of all. She strove to pre vail on her mistress to resign the charge of her master for the night, but fruitlessly. Accordingly, like a wise woman she went to bed, the better to be prepared for sleepless nights to follow. And now, for dreary hours VOL. II. E"], [58, "GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. 50 the mother and the friend sat in the light of the flick ering fire, and the melancholy rushlight, watching the shadows on the walls, or on the floor, or the faint spasms contracting the patient's forehead ; anxiety struggling with natural drowsiness, which should gain the victory over the senses. Every hour seemed to contain, not sixty minutes, but six hundred, and when the church clock woke up the echoing clocks in hall and kitchen, and hammered down the hours decisively, there was sure to be the whispered remark from one or other how slowly the time moved. The cock's shrill clarion had startled the ear with its proclamation of day before the servants sank to sleep, but as the shivering hours crept towards the dawn, one by one the hardy winter birds twittered in their nests, or chirped their matins from the icicle hung evergreens, long ere the lazy morning opened its cold grey eyes. Within the house, too, rose the hum of wakening life, subdued, but still audible ; then there was a faint tap at the new chamber door, an anxious inquiry, and the reply was passed round the household, that Mr. Latham was still asleep and composed ; and thence the bulletin sped to the vil lage ; more than one rough-pated man having waited at the back gate from daybreak for the welcome news. About eight o'clock George languidly opened his"], [59, "51 AND AT THE LODGE. eyes, turned his head from side to side, and glanced from one object to another, as if endeavouring to recall the events of the preceding day. The effort to move, though slight, was attended with much pain to neck and shoulder ; and now it was he remembered all that his friends did not know, but nothing which had transpired after he had fallen in the snow, and in feeble tones he asked, how he came there ? At the sound of his voice, low and faint as it was, a prayer of silent thankfulness rose from the mother's heart ; but subduing every appearance of emotion, lest she should agitate her beloved son, she simply bade him be calm and silent, as the doctors had ordered ; and he was much too weak to disobey. A spoon diet had been dictated, and the first instalment was administered as he lay, any attempt to raise even his head producing acute pain. The old housekeeper took the place of Madam Latham and Mr. Gresham, while they left the room for a breakfast very much needed ; but nothing could induce the old lady to retire to repose, until after the doctors' visit and favourable verdict. Then, having first assured herself she had done all for him he required at the time, she went to her own room, and without undressing further than to ex change her velvet dress for a loose rocquelaire, e 2"], [60, "52 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. mounted by the bed-steps to her high bed, and lay down prepared to rise in an instant, if required. The Kev. Mr. Gresham, too, departed, having to read prayers for the Christmas service : and over and around the mansion was preserved a stillness unbroken and unusual. Ph\u0153be, who had remained all night, came and sat with the housekeeper until church time. and when George appeared anxious to speak to her, the young girl, kind and feeling, notwithstanding her thoughtless vanity, put her finger on her lip, and. bending over his pillow, whispered that his mother had intrusted the miniature to her for conveyance. He looked his thanks, but only said, \" Don't alarm Miss Ford!\" \"Hush! I don't iutend. I know better,\" was Ph\u0153be's brief answer, with the finger on her lip again. \" What is all that whispering about, Ph\u0153be ? You must leave the room if you will talk to Mr. George. You know his life depends on his being kept perfectly quiet ! \" was the disturbed remonstrance of old Mrs. Emery, addressed to her young companion in an under tone. \" I know, Mrs. Emery, and am going ; but I would not say or do anything to harm Mr. Latham any more than you ! \" and so saying, Ph\u0153be left the apartment. and George's thoughts went with her. Poor George ! there was not much prospect of a"], [61, "AND AT THE LODGE. 53 merry Christmas for him ! Scarcely three weeks ago his heart beat high with hope and love, and he anti cipated a Christmas and New Year of rare delight. Cruelly, too cruelly, had reality mocked hope ! As though it were not enough his suit should be rejected, and himself thrust aside to make way for another, with little or no hope to bear him up for the future. As though it were not sufficient he should be com pelled to correspond with Alice by stealth, and catch a stray glance of her once a week, whilst a perfumed and powdered town-dandy hovered about her, privi leged to sit beside her, attend her walks, join in her devotions, to press her hand and look into her eyes, and tell his tale of love fearlessly. As though all this should be insufficient, even his own slight comfort of correspondence and weekly meeting was now gone, destroyed by the dastardly shot which had crippled him hand and foot. He had built on his prospect of meeting her that morning, and during the customary brief greeting passing to her hand his Christmas gift, and hearing or seeing her thanks. He had hoped to scrutinise, and perchance to good purposes, the interloping suitor whose correspondence with his uncle Jeffery puzzled and perplexed him ; and all these hopes had been annihilated in an instant by a ruffian's bullet. Thoughts like these, chasing each other in rapid"], [62, "54 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. succession through an invalid's brain, were not cal- culated to preserve the equanimity so necessary to recovery; and when Madam Latham returned to the apartment, after a brief sleep, as a natural consequence, she found him restless and feverish. Her inquiries elicited the information that Master George was calm enough until Ph\u0153be whispered something in his ear, and that he had been growing gradually worse ever since. Wiser than her informant, the good lady did not, like Mrs. Emery, attribute George's unfavourable symptoms to Ph\u0153be's whisper, the purport of which she conjectured, but to his impatient and impulsive nature, chafing at this fresh impediment in his path. Accustomed for many years to identify her interests, her joys and sorrows with those of her son, his disap- pointment was a disappointment to her, his grief brought grief to her ; but she reasoned where he only felt ; and glad would she have frequently been could the wisdom of her age have curbed the impetuosity of his youth. Dismissing Mrs. Emery on some trivial pretext, she turned to George, and finding him still conscious, spoke of that which lay nearest his heart, justly con sidering that though conversation was interdicted, the troubled thoughts which agitated bis mind were more to be feared than quiet speech judiciously directed to calm and soothe the mental tumult. She besought"], [63, "AND AT THE LODGE. 55 him earnestly to dismiss from his mind all thoughts of a disturbing tendency, as his life and love, and her happiness depended entirely on his serenity of heart. Ah, how vain ! Efforts to drive thought into fresh channels seldom, if ever, succeed, and the imagination of a sick man is of all things most capricious and uncontrollable. And so Madam Latham found to her sorrow. Although she selected a book, and read to the restless man ; either the subjects were ill chosen, or pain dis tracted him, for she failed to arrest his wandering attention. But irksome as he found it to remain quiet in one position, his habitual obedience, seconded may be by a sharp reminder from his shoulder when ever he stirred, however slightly, prompted him to acquiesce, and keep his body quiescent, whatever pace his thoughts maintained ; and, as a natural result, the afternoon found him neither better nor worse than he was on her return to his bedside. Hitherto nothing was known of the cause of his injuries, beyond what conjecture or observation sup plied ; but Madam Latham finding his mind still wandering to the Grange, and desirous to divert him from distressing contemplations of the possible doings there ; began to narrate how his steed came home riderless, how friends and dependents had hurried in quest of him, and the condition in which he was"], [64, "GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. 56 found and brought home. As a pendant to her information, followed an inquiry as to the description and number of persons by whom he had been at tacked, the trampled snow having told of a struggle in which more than one person had been engaged. Never had an attempt to calm an uneasy patient been more unfortunate. As the natural question left her lips, his eyes lit with angry flashes, and feeble as he was, he strove to rise, with strange energy, as if to give vent to some powerful emotion. But the effort was too great for him : acute agony cut short the words \" Uncle Jeff \u2014 \" with a deep groan, and he sank back on the pillow fainting, leaving his mother alike bewildered with surprise and alarm at the sad issue of her experiment. Distractedly she summoned assistance, all known available restoratives were ap plied, but a considerable time elapsed before con sciousness returned, and even then it was only a fitful flash. Disturbed and feverish, he moved his head uneasily to and fro on the pillow, displacing the bandages, and irritating the wound with every move ment, until long before midnight he raved in perfect delirium ; bis uncle Jeffery, Alice, Mr. Heywood, Ned Bostock, and Mr. Peover, blending in the phan tasmagoria he created with the incoherence and con fusion of a dream. The sympathetic curate had resumed his place bv"], [65, "AND AT THE LODGE. 57 his young friend's couch, after the conclusion of the morning service, and when these very unfavourable symptoms set in, without hesitation decided on riding over to Chester for one or other of the medical men. He argued that in all probability they would both be suiTOunded by festive parties, and a more important and imperative emissary than Tom might be required to impress them with the necessity of resigning plea sure at the call of duty. And so it turned out. Dr. Wimslow, ruddy and jolly, was unwilling to leave the guests assembled round his own bright fire, for a midnight ride over the snow ; and not appearing competent to keep the saddle if he mounted it, or to count a pulse if his fingers found it, the reflective clergyman did not press the point, but rode at once from his door in the Watergate, to his colleague's in Trinity Street. Mr. Prestbury was from home, with his wife and children at a family gather ing in Nicholas Street, and thither he turned his horse's head. The surgeon was luckily in better condition than the M.D., and though he glanced ruefully from the warm rooms to the cheerless street, and though wistful faces looked longingly anxious for his stay, he buttoned up his great-coat (the poor curate wore one of George Latham's) and prepared for the journey. A horse was hired from the Yacht Inn, they called at the surgery for indispensable"], [66, "58 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. medicaments, and soon were in the open country speeding for bare life. A woful Christmas Day had that been at Latham Lodge, closing with a prospect of as mournful a New Year. The customary greetings as the household assembled were omitted as unfitting and out of place ; every face wore a sombre, anxious expression, every voice was hushed to an undertone, the blow which had fallen on the head of the house was felt keenly by its meanest member. Madam Latham, with her usual forethought, even in the midst of her trouble, directed that the super fluous store of provisions laid in for hospitable con sumption, should be distributed to the needy in the village ; for though eating and drinking, as part of the business of life, went on as ever, feasting at the Lodge this Christmastide was not to be thought of. Mirth had given place to melancholy, song and laughter to sighs and tears ; the one thought of the household was Mr. George, the one dread of the household his dissolution. Many weeks elapsed before Madam Latham learned that which she had sought to know of her son's disas trous encounter : thus it came about. On obtaining the miniature from the jeweller to whom it had been intrusted for setting, he had called, as was his custom, at God's Providence House on his way home,"], [67, "AND AT THE LODGE. 59 to pay his respects to his godfather, and at the same time display his portrait for the opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Peover as to its merits. He found the good old man in bed, swathed in flannel, bound down in the iron grip of rheumatism, and feelingly condoled with the sufferer debarred from the enjoyment of Christ mas ; having no presentiment, no foreshadowing of the bed he would himself press before nightfall, or the gloomy Christmas about to set in at the Lodge. He produced the miniature for inspection, making no secret of its destination, and when that it had been sufficiently admired, listened very complacently to an enumeration of the contents of the hamper from the Grange, and was rewarded for his patience by some very unexpected encomiums of Alice. Mr. Peover lifted one hand out of bed to display one of the warm mittens she had knitted to protect his wrists, and Mrs. Peover produced an embroidered housewife, \u2014 the young girl's gift to herself, and the kind note which accompanied it. He read the note and listened to her praises with glowing cheeks, proud to have his choice so favourably confirmed. \" She's a kind lass that, very kind lass ! Most girls of her age are taken up with their sweethearts, or themselves, or some other frippery, and have no thoughts to spare for old folk, old folk like \u2014 Oh ! \" The ejaculation which terminated the old man's speech was"], [68, "60 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. drawn from him by a sudden twinge which caused him to collapse suddenly under the patchwork coverlet. But Mrs. Peover took up the pleasing theme in a similar strain, praising the industry and housewifely properties of the young lady, as displayed on the occasion of their visit to the Grange ! \" It does not take long,\" said she, \"for an old woman like myself to sum up the domestic qualities of a young one, Mr. George ; and though I spent but one day under their roof, I saw that that day was but a sample of others. That girl will make a notable wife ! I observed too,\" she continued, \"that Mrs. Ford depended on her daughter's judgment in almost everything, but that there was no consequent assump tion on the daughter's part; on the contrary, her obedience was implicit and unconstrained. These little gifts, too, show a veneration for age most uncommon in young people now-a-days, and as such we prize them far beyond their actual value.\" \" That we do, George, that we do ! When a young woman employs time and fingers on trifles to please old people, nothing to her, they've a right to prize her work, and her too, and her too ! \" struck in the old man. \" She is a dear kind girl ; no one knows better than myself,\" warmly chimed in George, \" and I am proud to find I am not alone in my opinion.\""], [69, "AND AT THE LODGE. 61 \"Indeed you are not. We admire her much, and both Joseph and I think you will be a fortunate man to win her ! \" responded the old lady, as she folded up the housewife carefully in tissue-paper. \" Ah, Mrs. Peover, I should indeed be a fortunate man to win her, but unhappily\u2014 \u2014 \" \" Her obstinate father won't see you with her eyes \u2014 with her eyes ! Isn't that it ? Isn't that it ? \" interrupted his godfather. \" Well,\" replied George petulantly, \" Mr. Ford is so obstinately bent on her marrying a fellow from Manchester, named Heywood, whom he accidentally picked up somewhere or other, our chance of marrying is slight indeed. We are hoping against hope ;\" and his voice sank despondingly. \" By the way,\" resumed he, looking up briskly, \" do you ever hear anything of that scapegrace nephew of yours? Ned Bostock never forgave me for coming between him and Alice to protect her from his insults. That was three years ago, when you had him at home here ill. I have not seen him for a long time.\" Mr. Peover 's teeth chattered, but not with pain, as his wife calmly replied. \" Nor have we. He has not dared to show his face here ; but we have had several threatening letters from him. He knows his uncle is timorous, and he works upon his fears.\" \"How? What does he threaten? Can I be of"], [70, "62 god's PROVIDENCE HOUSE. any service in the matter? You know you may command me at any time, and in any way,\" suggested the impulsive young gentleman. \"You, are too young for a counsellor, Mr. George, and Joseph needs no champion. He has resolved, as soon as he quits his sick-bed, to seek the advice of the only man who can be of service in the matter. Besides, 'barking dogs seldom bite.'\" And Mrs. Peover nodded her belief in the adage. \" But if I am any judge of dogs, Ned Bostock is one that would bite, and savagely too, and bite as readily the hand that fed as the foot that spurned him. I expect him to serve me an ill turn some of these days when I am least prepared for it.\" \" God forbid, my boy! God forbid!\" exclaimed Mr. Peover. \" I miss your father, George, now. While he lived I never wanted a friend \u2014 never wanted a friend,\" continued the old builder regretfully. \"Nor shall you while I live, my dear old god father ; \u2014 only try me ! But I must be off now ; mother will be looking out for me. It is not fit the master of the house should be away on Christmas Eve, and it is growing late. My filly will be tired of waiting. Good afternoon, and a merry Christmas to you both ! \" \" Merry Christmas, and a happy New Year ! A happy New Year, my boy!\" echoed the old man,"], [71, "AND AT THE LODGE. 63 proffering to the young one's grasp the one hand not crippled by rheumatism. \"Merry Christmas, Margery!\" exclaimed George, popping his head in at the kitchen door in passing. \" The same to you, and many of them, Mr. Latham,\" was Margery's rejoinder, with a demure curtsey in acknoAvledgment of his notice. \"A happy Christmas, George, to you and yours, and may God speed you, and bless! \" was the parting benediction of the quiet old lady as she opened the door for his departure, and Avatched him mount and ride aAvay before she returned to her husband's chamber, and the arrangement of Dorcas-like gifts for the morrow. Elated with the praises bestowed on Alice, ' and cheered by the kind Avishes of his father's Avorthy friend, he rode on at a good round pace in the gathering twilight, past the cross, under the North gate, and out into the open country, thinking tenderly of Alice, Avondering how she Avould receive his Christ mas-box, and Avhether her father ever would relent ; when, as he crossed the intersecting road from Back ford his thoughts Avere put to flight by a sudden interruption. Springing upon him unawares \u2014 whence he saw not \u2014 a man roughly grasped his bridle and drove the filly back upon her haunches, at the same time"], [72, "64 god's PROVIDENCE HOUSE. demanding the traveller's purse in peremptory tones. Not inclined to surrender his property so readily, George raised the handle of his riding-whip and struck a smart blow at the intruder's hand. Ere it fell, however, he caught a glimpse of the man's upturned face, not in time to arrest its descent, but to check a second aimed with more precision at his head. \" Uncle Jeffery ! \" exclaimed he in a tone of abhorrence. \" Uncle Jeffery ! \" \"Oh, you know me, do you, my sine gentleman?\" was the harsh reply, as a horseman rode up on the other side. \" Know you ? Yes ! for a thorough villain, the shadow on my path, the bane of my life. Let go the reins, I say. There is my purse if that can serve you ; \" and he threw it to the ground as he spoke contemptuously. \" But let me pass ! Do you hear ! Let me pass ! I do not wish to strike again, now I know you ; but by Heaven if you do not loose the reins I shall. Let them go, I say ! \" angrily and vehemently urged George, with still uplifted whip, and looks full of loathing. \" You don't strike a Latham twice, though you be a Latham, my fine springald. You want your comb cutting, my cock o' the dunghill ! \" was the ruffian's coarse reply, as he still held the reins with a strong grip. Again George's whip came down heavily on"], [73, "AND AT THE LODGE. 65 Jeffery Latham's Avrist ; but as it descended the ruffian called to the horseman, who, confronting George, also blocked up the road. \" Ned, wing the young jacka napes ! \" On the instant, the rider (Avho wore a crape mask) levelled a pistol at George. Avhose arm was a third time uplifted to free himself, and fired at his comrade's bidding, exclaiming exultingly at the same moment, \" We're quits now ! \" Jeffery Latham's grasp on the reins had ahead)' made his nephew's seat uneasy, but the sharp hot pang as the Avhizzing bullet ripped up the flesh, instantly sickened and stunned him. Whip and rein dropped from his grasp, and, as the chafed horse reared, he fell heavily off, with his leg doubled under him, on the down-trodden frost-hardened snow ; Avhilst the goaded filly, released, sped hurriedly to- Avards home. \" I fear you have finished him,\" muttered the old villain, bending over his brother's son Avith a slight touch of compunction, nevertheless pocketing the chinking purse as he spoke. \" And what matter if I have ? Won't it be all the better for you, and all of us ? Would you have him live to hang you for this night's work ? \" \" Hang me !

Dead men don't blab. But come, we'd best be off ; there's a farm close by, and our shot may bring the folk down upon us. We meet to-night at the old spot,\" answered the horseman sharply. \" Why, Avhat are you staring at ? \" continued he gruffly. \" Let him be, hell take no harm ! I'm off, and you'd best be moving ! \" With that the speaker galloped off in the direction of Parkgate, looking back over his shoulder to see if his loitering mate had taken his advice. Nor did he think it wise to linger, but strode off towards Chester, moodily muttering as he went, \" I didn't mean Ned to kill the lad ; he never did me any harm. Not that I care a button for any man's life, but ' blood's thicker than water,' and he looks lying there so lite his father Avhen we Avere boys too-ether, it somehow goes against the grain.

What if other hands did wield the murderous weapons, so long as word, or act, or look, or tone of his said \" strike,\" his Avas the guilty deed ; and conscience, which he could not slay, nor bribe, would lay this young blood at his door. He met his evil comrades at their secret haunt that night, and gambled away the blood-stained guineas, drinking and blaspheming until the morning was far advanced ; but more than once from the snowy ground his brother's face looked up and asked him for his son.

EvERY-day experience proves that sorrow or trouble must come very near to our OAvn hearts to make any permanent impression on us ; and perhaps it is a wise provision of our nature that it should be so, else the whole Avorld would be wrapped- in perpetual gloom. No man would enjoy the happiness in his own house hold if his neighbour's sorrow were to be afflictive as his OAvn. No free man would exult in his liberty so long as other men Avere slaves. We grieve for the afflictions Ave see or share, touched Avith true sym pathy ; but turning once aside, thought and feeling flow into other channels, and our sorrow floats away as a mist before the sun. Thus it was that though the Shotwick people one and all lamented the terrible misfortune which"], [77, "SECRETS OF THE FOLDED HEART. 69 darkened the Latham doors, they carried no shadow of this sorroAv with them to disturb digestion at Mr. Ford's hospitable board ; and though thought less Ph\u0153be came from the wounded man's bed side, and bore a message, kindly equivocal to one deeply interested in his wellbeing, she laughed and danced and sung, oblivious of the tears she had that morning shed at the sight of suffering. Proud of the notice of the gallant Mr. Heywood, she felt disposed to scorn both her every-day lovers, or at least to set a higher value on her favours ; and when Matthew Spark, drunk to blindness, assumed as a right that which she had not quite decided on granting even as \u25a0a, favour, and moreover failed to distinguish between herself and homely Jane Wood, then all the pride of her nature rose indignantly in arms, and she repulsed him haughtily. But when he became brutish and loathsome, and forgot the decent respect due from a man to a woman, whether maid or matron \u2014 when he disgusted her with his coarse caresses, and terrified her with his unruly violence, she clung to Miles for protection instinctively, yet with a dawning consciousness that she little deserved it. For once in her laughing life she Avas silent in the presence of an admirer, though neither sulky nor wayward. For once she was serious, and reflected. All Madam Latham's lessons and"], [78, "70 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. lectures croAvded into her mind, and she weighed Matthew and Miles at last in a just balance. There was no disguising the fact that Matthew Avas a drunkard, when even her presence could not restrain him ; and no Christmas license could excuse his coarseness to herself, or account for the contrast between himself and Miles. Still he was an open and avowed admirer, not a whit less devoted when she froAvned than when she smiled ; and it was pleasant to have so obsequious a slave at her beck and call. But Miles only followed at a distance, looked and sighed, but said nothing \u2014 or nothing to the purpose. He had never given her a chance of saying \" No ; \" whilst she had said \" No \" to Matthews scores of times. It was really provoking; she was sure she had given him plenty of opportunities to speak out if he had cared for her. She wondered if he did care for her \u2014 and what he was thinking of then. He was thinking, little Ph\u0153be, that the time had come, sooner than he expected, Avhen those coquettish eyes Avould be opened, and when Matthew would drown his chance of favour in drink. Thinking that silence so unwonted was a token of reflection as unusual, and hoping all things from it. And so few words were exchanged between the pair. A desultory gossip on the strange events of the night, and the highway robbery of Mr. Latham, occupied the"], [79, "SECRETS OF THE FOLDED HEART. 71 party jogging homewards in straggling companionship, and Miles took part in it ; but Ph\u0153be, half ashamed to owe security to the man she had slighted so very recently and openly, forgot to be flippant, yet, true to herself, would not condescend to be too grateful ; and if she clung to the steady, manly arm closer than she had done hitherto, it was all unconsciously ; \u2014 an un witting confession of her dependence on his manhood and affection \u2014 nature asserting her sway when artifice was dozing. One by one their friends said \"Good-night,\" and lastly, Miles left Ph\u0153be at her father's door with a warm squeeze of the hand no longer withheld ; a few words of hope that she would have recovered from her fright before the morning ; and an invitation to spend the following afternoon with his mother and sister before Jane returned to her business in Chester. This she somewhat shily accepted, and took leave of his relatives with a simple friendliness very pleasant to see \u2014 affectation had no part in it ; but she hung her head as she said \" Good-by \" to Miles, and thanked him as graciously as her abashed self-love permitted. The shock-headed ostler opened the door for his young mistress, yawning and stretching as he closed it again, and retired to his nest in the hayloft. Ralph Home's old cronies had left song and pipe long before, and he awaited his bonny daughter's"], [80, "72 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. return in utter oblivion of the speeding hours. The unsnuft'ed candlewick was crowned with a tuft of sooty ash, the fire had died down into a feAV dull rod and white embers, there was a stifling reek of stale tobacco, but the fresh clouds had floated away into crevices and curtain folds. Pipes and mugs, tobacco and ashes, gummy rings of dried-up ale, and tallow from the guttering candle, adorned the round oak table in the bar ; and close beside, Avith legs out stretched before the fireplace, his hands thrust into his breeches-pockets, his purple face buried in his pigeon-breast, the monarch of that which, though sur rounding him, he did not survey, puffed and grunted in luxurious slumber. From this state of profound oblivion he Avas only roused to one of bewilderment, and she was suffered to depart to her chamber un questioned as to the extent of her day's enjoyment \u2014 for a wonder, as her father's first query invariably was \" How'st thee enjoyed theeself, wench ?\" Glad was she to escape question, for the little fluttering heart was taking itself to task, and ill brooked interruption. A large door will turn on a small hinge, and the experience of one night had done more to disgust Ph\u0153be Avith her unruly lover than all the sottery she had witnessed under her father's roof for months.

It must be remembered that drunkenness was not then contemned so universally as now ; and if she, born and partially reared under the shadow of a publican's SAviuging sign, Avas disposed to look leniently on a man \" taking to drink \" for love of her, the period itself afforded a partial excuse. But for three whole weeks she had bestowed her brightest glances, her sweetest smiles on him alone, had scoffed and scorned his rival on all occasions \u2014 had walked with him, and talked with him, even suffered his arm to clasp her waist (when she knew Miles Avas in sight), and his lips to approach hers \u2014 and, in fact, had so highly favoured the smith, that the least he could have done would have been to respect his privileges, and comport himself as befitted a swain so greatly honoured, and that too in the presence of the discarded suitor. Instead, he had disgraced himself and insulted her by a familiarity and license she had never warranted, and on a special occasion, before his betters \u2014 not only Miles, but Mr. Ford and the charming Mr. Heywood looking on. And what"], [82, "74 GOD'S PROATDENCE HOUSE. must Miles think ? Miles, Avho was always steady and sober, and looked so grave Avhen she refused to dance Avith him, and gave her hand to MattheAv. Perhaps Miles thought the girl who could take up with Matthew Spark was not Avorth having, and that Avas why he had never asked her to have him. Perhaps her own conduct had driven him off, and sent him to Chester to find a kinder sweetheart there. But if she had, Avas it altogether her own fault? Was she to drop into his mouth like an over-ripe plum when he only looked up at the bough ? Not she ! If he wanted her, he ought to have asked her !

And> after all, he was better-looking than Matthew, and not quite such a clown, and really he had improved very much latterly ; and she began to think she had been a very great fool to slight him for that drunken brute.

She would not go to his house on the morrow to be a laughing-stock to his prim sister, that she wouldn't ! and then she changed her mind, and then \u2014 and then \u2014 and then \u2014 she fell asleep. And while she sleeps the slide is withdrawn from the author's magic lantern, and Ave look once more on Grenville Grange.

Michael storming and fuming at a catastrophe so subversive of the scepticism he had been striving to inculcate, so inimical to his interests in the property ? Alice, stricken down by the one word, \" killed,\" which had caught her ear, coupled with the name of her lover ? or Robert Heywood, bearing in his arms to the parlour the insensible form of the girl he madly loved, knowing her to be thus prostrated by fears for another's safetv ?"], [84, "76 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Truly, Mr. Heywood Avas a peculiar man ! Whilst others ran about confused and confusing, calling for burnt feathers, vinegar, water, and what not, or stood helpless by, wringing useless hands, he laid her on the large sofa, kneeling by her side, still retaining her in his clasp, and Avith his disengaged hand produced from his Avaistcoat-pocket an ornamental scent-bottle with a silver lid above the stopper. This was filled Avith some pungent essence, and he applied it to her nostrils, Avhilst her mother bathed her forehead and palms with vinegar, or sprinkled water in her face ; and then again he resorted to his restorative essence, never once relinquishing his clasp, but holding her like something he had battled for and won. Father and mother had followed, and stood beside the couch, but he held her as though his claim superseded theirs ; and Michael, seeing nothing but his child fainting for a Latham, and a generous, devoted lover striving to restore her, allowed the prior claim, whilst Margaret, busied with the vinegar and water, thought nothing whatever about it. In removing or placing Alice Avhere she lay, either by accident or design, Robert Heywood entangled his fingers in her gold chain, and dragged from its Avarm hiding-place poor George's dearly-bought miniature. His brow contracted for the instant, and his teeth set, but his face only Avore a sardonic smile as he pointed"], [85, "SECRETS OF THE FOLDED HEART. 77 it out to Mr. Ford, and then, by a quick movement, arrested his hand as Michael would have snatched it from her neck. \" Time enough for that,\" said he, \" wait until a fitter opportunity ; do not give the SAveet girl a second shock.\" \" Well, Robert,\" replied her father, \" have your own Avay ; if you can suffer her to retain another man's portrait, I have no reason to interfere. You are certainly the most generous and magnanimous Avooer I ever met. Assuredly you deserve better treatment than you have had from our Alice.\" \" Hush ! I love her too well to disturb her now ! \" Avhispered the seemingly chivalrous gentleman to the straightforward, too-confiding Mr. Ford, as they both bent over her, and Alice slowly unclosed her brown eyes with a Avondering \"Where am I?\" looking vacantly on the many anxious faces around her. Presently with returning consciousness came the memory of what she had heard, and there was a tendency to relapse, but a timely application of Mr. Heywood's potent essence revived her; and as her senses fully returned she shrank from the clasping arm, and endea.voured to free herself, as she did so becoming aware of the exposed miniature. The blood mantled to her forehead in a crimson flush as her glance met Mr. HeyAvood's, and she saw that he was in possession of her secret, but the tide rushed back"], [86, "78 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. to her heart leaving her pale -with apprehension Avhen she saw her father's eye fixed on her with an ex pression not to be misunderstood. It held no sympathy Avith the emotions of distress or dread with Avhich she Avas overAvhelmed so suddenly, but a gathering of stern displeasure at the discovery hoAv close to her heart was the image of the man he had peremptorily forbidden her to love. (Forbidden to love ! ah, when did love come or go at bidding ?) Instinctively her hand Avas raised to conceal and guard her neAv treasure, and as instinctively she thrust back Mr. Heywood's intrusive arm with an abrupt assur ance that she Avas better and needed no support \u2014 more inclined to resent his position as presumptuous familiarity, than to thank him for timely assistance. A heavy sigh, and a reproachful look into her sad eyes, as he removed the offending arm, and rose from his knees obedient to her will, reminded her that his reverent homage and assiduous attention asked for polite consideration at least, and she added apolgeti cally, extending her hand which he clasped eagerly, \" Pardon me, Mr. HeyAvood, I am not uumindful of your kindness, but I have had a great shock this night, and am not altogether myself.\" Her hand was dropped and his face betokened a struggle with some powerful feeling, but he replied sadly in a low tone, \" For every reason I regret that"], [87, "SECRETS OF THE FOLDED HEART. 79 this should be, dear Alice ; I too have had a shock, not perhaps the less severe, but \" \" How dare you say such a thing before my face. Miss,\" angrily interrupted Michael, before Mr. Hey wood had concluded, \" Here, you scream and faint because a sneaking vagabond is knocked down, and when a true-hearted, sensible felloAV, who would lay his life down for you, has done his best to bring you round, you first push' him rudely aAvay, and then prate of the shock you have had. \u2014 What are you lasses staring and listening for ? Be off to bed, every one of you ! \" This explosive digression was addressed to the servant-girls, who huddled together near the room door, watched the progress of Alice's recovery, and loitered still ; interested and curious. They did not require a second Avarning, but were off, and soon might be heard ascending the creaking kitchen-stair case. Michael, however, without pause, resumed his irate address to Alice. \" You maunder about a shock which has made you not yourself! Hoav dare you make an assertion at once so bold and insulting ?\" Alice had trembled, and her pallor increased at the commencement of this reproof ; but before he ended a change came over her mind and face ; she rose and stood erect. \" Father ! \" said she, \" you trained me to be truthful, and fearless in the utterance of truth ; had I spoken otherwise than I did to Mr. HeyAvood"], [88, "80 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. I should have been false to all your teaching \u2014 false to myself. If I unwittingly inflicted pain, I am sorry for it, but the fault was not mine.\" \"Mr. Ford \u2014 Alice,\" interposed Mr. HeyAvood, seeing both inclined to speak, \" may I beg that this con versation be abandoned ; the topic is not one to be discussed before me, and I Avould spare both myself and Miss Ford some pain.\" \" I thank you, Mr. Heywood,\" assented Alice, Avith graceful dignity, \"and agree Avith you : besides, I am Aveary, and the morning is advancing. I need repose. Good night, sir !\" and again she offered her hand at parting to her inscrutable lover, Avho this time pressed it warmly and raised it to his lips in respectful silence. Next she turned to her displeased father, then pacing the room angrily muttering to himself, and raised her mouth for his accustomed kiss, but he waved her back. \" No ! \" said he, \" learn your lesson of respect and duty better, before you come to me professing love. Good night !\" A tear glistened in her eye at this repulse, but she answered steadily, \" I have not failed in respect, and I intend to do my duty. Good night, father! Mother, I do not feel very strong, will you lend me your arm to my room ?\" \" Certainly, Alice ;\" and the quiet woman, who had been a grieved Avitness of this unhappy quarrel, and"], [89, "81 SECRETS OF THE FOLDED HEART. had listened Avith varying emotions and opinions, too timid to interfere, stepped forward to her daughter, now weakened by her prolonged syncope, and the agitation following it. But Robert Heywood, observing that Alice tottered, darted forward and drew her other arm Avithin his, saying, \" Permit me, dear Alice ; your mother's arm is not sufficient.\" He supported her up the staircase and along the corridor with the gentleness of a tender brother, bade the ladies a kind \" Good-night,\" and returned to Mr. Ford. He found his prospective father-in-law still pacing moodily the long room from end to end. The fire had subsided to ashes, half the candles had burned themselves out, or were dying in their sconces, others were flaring or guttering in the draughts from the open doors ; nutshells, orange-peel, and apple cores bestrewed floor and fireplace, and mingled Avith empty cups and glasses on tables and buffet. Chairs and draperies were in disorder, and the polished oaken floor Avas scratched and scored by the nails of heavy boots. The atmosphere was impregnated with a combined odour of vinegar, burnt feathers, ale, punch, tobacco-smoke, and candle-snuff. All the cheerful brightness of the room was gone, and after-revel dis comfort reigned instead. In the midst Michael strode backwards and forwards Avith his hands behind him, VOL. II. G"], [90, "82 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. cogitating on the events of the night, and the fatality Avhich seemed to overhang the Grange. All he had done to restore confidence in servants or villagers had been nullified \u2014 how, or by whom, he had yet to discover, but he Avould find it out or his name was not Michael Ford ; and neither ghost nor goblin should drive him from the place, he was determined. \" As for Alice \" Mr. Heywood's entrance put his ruminations to flight, but their discourse flowed in the same channel ; and the younger gentleman, with much seeming earnestness, strove to restrain the elder from undue harshness towards his daughter, and convince him of the impolicy of any active or immediate attempts to coerce her choice or free will. So subtle was the reasoning of clever Mr. Hey- Avood, that Michael, whom none could drive, and few lead, surrendered his own will to his friend's for the present, only the more firmly resolved upon the marriage of the two, and impressed Avith the excellence and nobility of Robert's disposi tion. \"If I read the character of my dear Alice aright,\" said the latter, \" she would detest me were I forced upon her in her present mood. She would chafe under opposition ; but in time, with care, I may win her by my patience and devotion. If the young"], [91, "SECRETS OF THE FOLDED HEART. 83 fellow you named (the same I presume whose likeness she cherishes), Mr. Mr. \" \" Latham,\" supplied Mr. Ford. \" If this Mr. Latham be killed,\" continued he, \" or die of his wounds, she might in a short time forget him, or transfer her affections to me. I do not suppose she is very deeply enamoured, and Ave must not deepen the impression by opposition. But if she were convinced of his unAvorthiness in any way, the revulsion of feeling would be in my favour. Not that I am aware he is umvorthy, but he may be, you knoAv ! \" suggested the diplomatic tempter. \" Like enough, he comes of a bad stock ! I'll keep a sharp look out on the young sprig, never fet-f,\" chimed in Michael, with a wise shake of his head. Hoav Mr. HeyAvood's eyes glittered, as if he had gained a point ; but without further reference to his rival, so little likely to trouble him, he simply resumed, \" I see and feel that my Alice has a gentle and kindly nature, is unwilling to give pain, is grateful for small services, and I hope more from a series of minute attentions, and from deferential homage, than obtrusive zeal. I must undermine the citadel of her heart, not storm it ! \" \" Well, Robert, my boy, if you have patience for a long siege I'll not gainsay it ; but Avere I in your g2"], [92, "84 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. place, I'd let no man fodder his steed in my stable Avhile mine shivered at the door, if I could turn him out But any way, I wish you success with all my heart, and marry you she shall. And now, good night ! the cocks have been crowing these two hours.\" In his owu chamber Robert HeyA\\'ood's face as sumed another aspect, \u2014 the patience of the wily man was gone,\u2014 fierce anger, bitter hate, slighted We, contended for the mastery with exultation at the success of his own plotting. His Avas not a tamo, commercial, loitering love, biding tho issues of the market-day, but wild and unruly, chafing at delay, and mocking at impediments. Whatever SAvept his rival from his path Avould be a joy to him; his very name was hateful : what then the pang inflicted by tho unbosomed portrait? But he would wipe the paint from the ivory, and the man from the heart ere long, and Alice should be his, however won, and that, too, with Grenville Grange aud its broad lands for her rich dower ! Poor Alice, tossing uneasily upon her pillow (wet with a rain of tears, and dried by burning cheeks), unconscious of the fierce passions at Avork so very near her, longed for the morn, and certain tidings of her lover. His painted semblance, pressed to breast and lips so Warmly, could not solve her doubts or answer her inquiries. Hilled ! she dared not think"], [93, "SECRETS OF THE FOLDED HEART. 85 it, or she should go mad ! Wounded, dying perhaps, and she singing and dancing at another's bidding, by another's side, the while. The thought was distract ing ! Hoav insupportable was the agony of suspense ! How she longed for the morning light, and intelli gence of George, her own, her long-loved, darling George ! But how should she obtain it ? Would Ph\u0153be come again after her fright? Were there such things as ghosts after all? \u2014 and her thoughts ran off at a tangent ; but back they came again to George, and her altered father, and wistful, devoted Mr. Heywood ; to the jealous watch on her own movements ; her passive mother's helplessness, the necessity for self-reliance ; the claims of opposing duties ; and, paramount over all, her love for George, intense and true, subordinating all things to itself. Morn came, and the car of routine rolled on regardless of the faint or weary crushed beneath the pitiless wheels. Servants arose in the grey dawn, shivering in the raw air, and shuddering at over night reminiscences ; the women to their several1 duties in kitchen, or dairy, or parlour, the men to barn or stack-yard, shippon or stable, field or garden. Then followed Michael, with his active foot, ready hand, practical head, and controlling will to overlook his farm, and hold the many reins. With him came his quiet little wife, secretly troubled, though to outer"], [94, "86 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. seeming undisturbed, and directed the discomposed maids, or occupied herself in household matters as busily and complacently as though the Grange had no unwelcome inmate, nor her child's heart a ruffling emotion. Forth from his room came the Manchester gentle man, trim and jaunty, powdered and perfumed, laced and ruffled, oblivious of all his host might care to forget, yet kindly solicitous for the general wellbeing. And, lastly, Alice dragged her reluctant limbs into the morning-room, to show unwillingly, by her pale face and heavy eyes, what a nightmare thought had been to her. With ever-ready politeness the gallant gentleman advanced to salute the late comer, and hand her as usual to her place at the board, with low and earnest inquiries how she had reposed after her recent ex citement and indisposition, and Avith watchful eye and ear for an answer which, however simple, must signify much to him. \" I did not sleep at all,\" was her calm and truthful reply. The singers which yet held the tips of hers in cross ing the room, pressed them with an involuntary grip, Avhich caused the eyes of Alice to seek his question ingly as she Avithdrevv her fingers from his hold, and passed on alone."], [95, "SECRETS OF THE FOLDED HEART. 87 \"Forgive me, Alice,\" whispered he, bending to wards her, \" I am not at all times master of myself,\" \"So I perceive, sir,\" was the cool rejoinder, and, turning to accost her mother, and bid her father good morning, she cut off any further reply. Breakfast at Ford-brook farm was a cheerful, chatty, comfortable meal ; breakfast at Grenville Grange was no such thing ; and, for the second time since they had rested under its roof, the family assembled at the well-covered table with a sense of disunion iceing the coffee and the conversation. In vain Mr. Heywood strove to reconcile the conflicting elements and smooth down asperities by the intro duction of general topics ; there was a war of feelings in each breast which kept the individual silent, or at least precluded fluency. The supernatural visitation of the preceding night had ripped up sore memories in Margaret's breast, and the discord betwixt her husband and child troubled her no little, though she gave no vent to her trouble in words. Michael brooded over the return of the Grey Lady, and studied hoAV to repair the mischief she had done; and as he sat Avith a clouded brow, his handkerchief over his knee, and his cup in his hand, glancing now and again at Alice, he thought that she, his pet daughter, whom he loved so well, was conspiring to thwart him; and"], [96, "88 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. that even Margaret was a shade cooler lately than she was wont to be ; and so he was not disposed to be loquacious. To Alice, agitated by fears for the life of her lover, tossed on a sea of suspense, grieved at the displeasure of her father, and the little sympathy of her mother, and troubled at the persevering attentions of Mr. Heywood, that break fast Avas an unchronicled martyrdom. No wonder then that she uttered a sigh of relief when it was over, and she rose to quit the room. But Mr. Heywood Avas not disposed to part with her so readily ; as she arose he said to her, plead ingly, \"May I remind you, Alice, of your promise to show the house and the grounds to me. A walk through the frosty air may bring the roses back to your cheeks.\" \" My promise, Mr. HeyAvood ! \u2014 I remember no pro mise, else would I keep it. But I am not very well, and must beg to be excused walking out this morning,\" was the frigid reply, as she gained the door, whence she Avas however peremptorily recalled by her father's voice. \" I made the promise, if you did not, miss, and I desire that you will put on your hat and cloak, and be ready to join Robert and me by the time I have shown him the haunted rooms. Margaret, will you join us in our walk ?\" was added in a softer tone, as"], [97, "SECRETS OF THE FOLDED HEART. 89 he turned to his wife, \" you may be able to suggest some little alterations or improvements which have not occurred to me.\" \" Certainly, Michael, if you wish,\" was the ready answer ; but, as Mrs. Ford's eye fell on Alice's re treating figure, she added, with some little hesitancy, \" but it will be rather inconvenient this morning, the house is in such disorder, so much remains to be cleared away, and both Peggy and Sally are afraid to stir beyond these lower rooms.\" \" Nonsense, nonsense ! they mu.st not be encouraged in such folly as that, and it's quite time you gave over working so hard yourself. If you want other hands, I'll find you another maid at the next hirings, or send one of the hinds' wives to help you ; but you must allow yourself more time for rest and recreation, my busy little Avife ; so give your orders to Peggy, and wrap yourself up well, to go round the place with us.\" \" Yery well, Michael, I will do as you wish. I only thought \u2014 but it does not signify \u2014 I will soon be dressed ;\" and with a half-sigh at the difficulty of controlling a rebellious spirit in the kitchen, in the guise of Sally, the new maid, and of prevailing on the timid Peggy to resume her duties as heretofore, particularly in the absence of herseif and Alice, she stepped from the breakfast-room to the kitchen calm and acquiescent."], [98, "90 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. \" Now, Robert, come with me. I do not care to take either Alice or that dear little mouse of mine into the cheese-room, at all events this morning ; I will show you all you will care to see upstairs.\" So saying, Michael opened the door, and, accompanied by Mr. Heywood, ascended the grand staircase, and passed from the corridor into the haunted chamber. As they entered, Michael observed with a start that the cheeses were a second time disarranged, and the foul red spot glared in the light of the December sun. _ \" What is that crimson stain, Mr. Ford ? \" asked Mr. HeyAvood, with a strange glance of inquiry at his surprised companion. \" That, that \u2014 why, that \u2014 well, Robert, I must own I am perplexed to say what it is,\" answered Michael, with an air of relief as he unbosomed himself of an uncomfortable secret. \" To tell you the truth, that stain has caused me no little perplexity and annoy ance. On that spot floAved the blood of the Mistress Grenville who is said to haunt these rooms. Now I must tell you, Robert,\" and he drew near to the place as he spoke (in a lower key than ordinary), \" before we came to reside here, I had these boards planed down, and with my own eyes saw that the stains were gone \u2014 completely gone !

Strange as it appears, I found my stock of cheeses disturbed as they are now, and, stranger still, that unsightly stain fresh and bright.\" \" Singular ! \" murmured Mr. Heyvrood, in marked amazement. \" That sounds like the old Holyrood tradition; but,\" added he, curiously, \"did you take no steps to obliterate the marks once more ? \" \" I could not well, without calling attention to a legend I Avished to remain unknown to my servants, and as anxiously desired to blot from the memory of my Avife. I had no inclination to either create or re fresh superstition, so I simply bent my shoulders and put the cheeses back in their places, intending when the builders Avere here again, in the spring, to bring a carpenter in quietly and have the plank planed down again, or the piece cut away. From that morning until this they have remained as I placed them, one on another in straight rows, and now you see the confusion they are in.\" \" Yes, I see, but cannot comprehend what should disturb them thus : they must be Aveighty, yet seem to have been thrown about as easily as so many"], [100, "92 god's providence house. pieces of silk or vehret. I am not naturally supersti tious, but I must own this passes my comprehension,\" ansAvered Mr. Heywood, seriously and deliberately, as if pondering a Aveighty question in his own mind. \" Well, Robert, no man is less inclined to super stition than myself,\" said Mr. Ford decisively, looking full into his companion's handsome but unreadable face, \" but you saw the commotion this shrieking spectre created last night amongst us (I only Avish you had been by my side at the time), and may judge of the effect of such a scene, Avhen reported, in lower ing the value of this fine estate ; and as the Grange is likely before many years to fall into your hands, either along Avith Alice, or at our death, it becomes your interest to help me to get to the root of this mischief. I cannot bring myself to believe in ghosts, and though I have seen some strange things since I took possession, I am not inclined to conclude there is more in this mystery than may be solved by common means, if Ave only possessed a clue to the secret. I believe in knavery and mischievous frolic, but I will not yield to a belief in supernatural visita tions ! \" and Michael brought down his raised right hand into the palm of the left, as settling his de cision.

These rooms leading from the landing near it (show ing them as he spoke) I also examined, and thence passed to the kitchen, but discovered nothing ; and the whole question is an unsolved puzzle to me to this day. \" Have you any neighbours at all interested in keeping you out of possession? or any one Avho sets up an opposing claim to the estate?\" insinuated rather than inquired Mr. Heywood, the sinister light in his eyes growing more intense and cold. \" It is essential to calculate motives before we can arrive at a conclusion in an account of this class.\""], [102, "94 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. \" Motives \u2014 claims \u2014 neighbours\u2014 why, I must have been stone blind all this time !

Well, so long as a man has an honest calling it does not much matter what that business may be.

Thank God, Robert, neither you nor I have much leisure to defile our fingers Avith mischief. Only such lazy louts as that Latham have time for that,\" added he, moving one heavy cheese after another Avhilst he continued speaking. The blood mounted to Mr. Heywood's temples as the farmer spoke, possibly called up by the unwonted exertion, as he assented dreamily to Michael's obser vations ; and the room being once more restored to order, led the Avay, lover-like, to Miss Ford's little sitting-room."], [104, "96 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. CHAPTER IV. THROUGH THE PLANTATION. The ladies were not alone. Almost simultaneously with the closing of the cheese-room door on Michael and Mr. Heywood, and with Alice's return down stairs, a visitor had arrived in the person of the Rev. Mr. Gresham, something in his face and manner pro claiming to Alice that his errand was especially to her. She received his visit in her sitting-room, and intimating that her father would be there presently, invited the reverend gentleman to be seated. After a few commonplace remarks on that English topic, the weather, there was a brief and embarrassing pause. The kind curate, unconscious that the young lady entertained a suspicion that his visit was anything more than one of ceremony, knew not how to break his ill news to her ear ; and she, anxious to question,"], [105, "THROUGH THE PLANTATION. 97 yet constrained by maidenly delicacy from baring her heart and its anxieties to a stranger, hesitated and was silent. At that instant Mrs. Ford entered, and her kindly welcome produced a momentary diversion. Her ap pearance assisted the gentleman out of his difficulty ; for he then perceived that both mother and daughter Avere in out-door costume, and at once assumed they Avere so prepared to visit their only neighbours, the Lathams. \" I trust I am not detaining you, ladies, since I observe you are in Avalking dress ? \" was his inquiry. \"Certainly not, sir,\" answered Mrs. Ford, \"we are Avaiting for Mr. Ford and a friend who is staying Avith us.\" \" Were we not, Mr. Gresham, we are sufficiently at leisure to entertain an esteemed neighbour Avho honours us Avith a call,\" added Alice smilingly. \" May I then ask, without impertinence,\" was his next question, \"if the destination of your walk be not Latham Lodge ? I have a reason for the inquiry which may excuse it,\" he apologetically added. The smile faded from Alice's face as she replied seriously, \" No, sir ; I am sorry to say my father has not yet sufficiently overcome a prejudice he has against the name of Latham to permit our friendly inter course. May we know your reason for the inquiry ? \" VOL. n. H"], [106, "98 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. \" Madam Latham is in much tribulation. Her son has been injured rather seriously, and I was in hope you were about to visit the Avidow in her affliction, Avas the curate's suggestive reply. \"Injured, not killed!\" murmured Alice to herself; then remembering the clergyman's presence, she said aloud, \" We heard something of this last night, Mr. Gresham, and were greatly alarmed. You will doubt less be able to relieve our anxieties and furnish us with correct information respecting the nature of Mr. Latham's injuries, and his present state.\" Her parted lips and advanced head evidencing an anxiety not shown in the formal words, and the \" we \" with which she strove to hide her own peculiar interest in George Latham's fate. \"Yes, sir, indeed we were very much alarmed \u2014 Alice especially. We heard Mr. Latham was almost killed. Was that true ? \" fell from simple-minded Mrs. Ford. \" Not far from the truth, I grieve to say,\" was the sorrowful reply. \" Some dastardly highwaymen must have assailed and robbed him, for his purse was gone, and he left senseless on the ground.\" \" But the injuries, Mr. Gresham, what was their character?\" somewhat impatiently urged Alice. \" A bullet Avound in the neck and a broken leg, caused by falling from his horse,\" promptly answered"], [107, "99 THROUGH THE PLANTATION. he, seeing that reservation was no longer either necessary or commendable. Alice Avas seated by her work-table near the Avindow with her back to the light, yet he could see her features working convulsively, despite the effort to conceal her emotion under mere friendly interest, an effort almost too great for her already overstrained mind to bear. She felt as though she longed to shriek aloud, but succeeded in compelling herself to maintain an outer calm, and in a short time asked, \"How is Mr. Latham this morning? Is he out of danger ? \" \"He is delirious, Miss Ford, and in a very pre carious state at present.

Your father will never permit you to go.\" \" I shall not ask him, mother. When duties are so divided, I must think and act for myself. I am not desirous to oppose his will unnecessarily, but in this case I have no alternative. I trust you will say nothing to cause my father to prevent my leaving home this afternoon. The same sense of duty which prompts the step will enable me on my return to answer it,\" said Alice, firmly ; but added in a loAver tone, \" This is not a question to be discussed before a stranger, mother ; I will speak to you about it after- Avards.\" \" Certainly, Alice ; but you know, you know \u2014 The entrance of the gentlemen cut short Margaret's reply, and the subject was dropped for the time. Michael shook hands with Mr. Gresham very warmly, said he Avas proud to see him, and hoped he Avould be a frequent visitor, not waiting for invitations. Mr. Heywood Avas introduced, and made himself very agreeable ; Christmas cakes and wine were brought forth, and, after half-an-hour devoted to chat and"], [109, "THROUGH THE PLANTATION. 101 refreshment, Michael proposed that Mr. Gresham should join in their stroll. The snow still lay thickly on the ground, beds and garden plots being indicated by their elevation above the smooth surface, broken into irregularity by the winter plants beneath, and dotted with shrubs or evergreens, on Avhich the white fleece hung in tufts, and icicles glittered in the Avatery sun. Feet sank in the snow on the untrodden paths, or dashed it about in little powdery showers ; and a light breeze spring ing up whirled the fine snow-powder hither and thither, and as they passed at times under low branches, which brushed Michael's elevated hat, sprinkled its atoms on and around them. There was little but this white robe to be seen in the open grounds, but Mr. Ford showed where the moat had been, and the bridges, and pointed to fields, through which they did not care to pass, explaining their fitness for pasturage or grain, add the crops he meant to raise thereon. Down to the river side they ram bled, and Michael told how Mr. Peover, looking at a suspicious boat close underneath the rock, had groAvn dizzy, and almost toppled over. \" Why, Robert, cannot you look from a rock into a river Avithout giddiness ? Positively you men, stifling in great towns, have less nerve than country Avomen. Alice, standing quite as close to the edge, does not"], [110, "102 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. blench; though, by jingo! she is white enough this morning, too.\" And Michael, laughing at the weak heads of toAvn-men, brought his heavy hand down on Mr. Heywood's shoulder in his jocularity. To his barns and shippons Michael led the way7, these had in a great measure risen under his direction, yet still were incomplete and insufficient. Former tenants had kept racers, hunters, and hounds ; but Michael's taste did not lie in that direction, so he had converted spare stabling and all the kennels to better purpose, and now showed his alterations Avith no little pride. \" He had housed his hinds,\" he said, \"where a set of drunken grooms and gamekeepers had lodged, and little children laughed where litters of whelps had formerly whined and yelped.\" In the spring, when the frost and snow were gone, Mr. Peover and his workmen would be there again to build him another cottage and extra shippon ; his beasts, he explained, Avere overcrowded as it Avas, although he had parted with several to Mr. Bradley before he left Ford-brook. On their return to the house, Mr. Gresham took his leave. Michael pressed him to remain and dine with them, but he excused himself on the ground that he Avas expected at the Lodge, and was anxious to ascertain if his highly-valued friend, Mr. Latham, Avas out of danger. The brow of Michael clouded at"], [111, "THROUGH THE PLANTATION. 103 the mention of the oft-recurring name, but he had sufficient generosity to ask the nature of Mr. Latham's injuries, and how sustained? He received the in formation previously given, though Avith more cir cumlocution, to Alice, and that set him thinking and inquiring. Mr. Gresham departed, but Michael continued in a brown study. It had occurred to him for the first time that if George Latham were lying wounded, and raving in delirium at the Lodge, he could not be playing the ghost at the Grange ; and this late discovery he communicated to Mr. Heywood, when the pair, after dinner, ascended the staircase to rap at panels, and press projecting knobs in search of a hiding-place for the midnight intruder, if a mortal. But Mr. Heywood, nothing disconcerted by an objection to his theory, which he had foreseen, quietly insinuated the possibility of a confederate \u2014 the disso lute uncle, in fact, and this, Michael admitted, was very feasible. And the search went on, commencing in the attics, and ending in the cheese-room, but ended as all other searches had done, in weariness and dis appointment to Michael. How Mr. Heywood felt was another matter quite. Had either searcher given a moment from the busy tapping and pushing at immoveable carvings, to glance from the draAving-room window, a patch of bright"], [112, "104 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. scarlet showing in perspective in bold relief against the white snow, Avould have warned them that Alice Avas afoot and away on her errand of love and mercy, Avhilst they were groping in a mist of antipathy and mischief. With a heart as chill as the snow she trod, though it beat and fluttered with the irregular pulsations of anxiety, she hurried on. The griffins frowned grimly, but she never looked up, her gaze was forward, only forward. Once she paused at the entrance of the lonely path through the plantation, and hesitated which route to take ; but that was the nearest way, she had trod the path before with George without meeting a human being, and why should she fear now ? So she raised the slight latch of the little wicket and stepped on fearlessly under the dark firs and cedars. Madam Latham received her young friend with a kind and motherly greeting. A second glance was not needed to show that they had shared each other's anxieties ; and the tremulous whisper of Alice, \" How is he ? \" was answered as simply as it was put \u2014 \" Very little better, my dear child, I grieve to say.\" There was a painful hush in the house. The slippered servants stole with noiseless feet, and spoke in undertones, though for any annoyance they would have caused the patient, they might have tramped about in pattens. The stillness, so different from"], [113, "THROUGH THE PLANTATION. 105 the bustling farm-life of the Grange (albeit toned down by the placid temperament of its mistress), affected Alice deeply ; it told how many shared her love and her fear, and she trembled as she fol lowed Madam Latham to her sitting-room. \" Our good curate, who has been an invaluable friend at this trying time, told me you were coming, my dear, and also that he feared you risked your father's displeasure in doing so. He repeated, moreover, your mother's kindly wish, for which you can say, I thank her. This is not a time to remember feud, or har bour suspicion ; and when death and life jostle each other on the brink of a precipice, all meaner feel ings than charity should be dumb with awe.\" An uneasy flush passed over Alice's face as this reflection on her father fell from the old lady's lips, but it quickly died away as Madam Latham gave her a succinct history of the sad event. The return of her son's horse, the search, and discovery of the insensible form on the foot-hardened snow, his wounds, the doctor's operations and opinions, and the seemingly slight cause of his relapse. \"Why did I not know of this earlier? I Avould have been here yesterday, had I only knoAvn, at any risk ! Oh, my dear Madam, it is a bitter thought to me, that whilst my poor George was tossing on a bed of pain, hovering between life and death, I was"], [114, "106 god's providence hoc se. dancing and singing in the midst of mirth and merri- O DO ment, with another man by my side, unconscious that the life dearer than my own was ebbing away.\" As she spoke Alice covered her face Avith her hands, and wept the bitter tears of regret and anguish, restrained in the presence of her own home friends. At home, Mr. Heywood stood betAveen her parents and herself, and severed the bonds of mutual sympathy ; there, George was a link between his mother's heart and hers, and that one common idol united them in their hopes, and fears, and sympathies. She could weep there ; at home she was too proud. Gently the kind old lady removed her young visitor's hat and cloak, smoothed doAvn the rippling chestnut curls, and kissed her on the forehead, calling her \" daughter \" the Avhile ; her own tears dropping in sorrowful companionship. \" You must be prepared for a sad change in my dear boy \u2014 even a mother's eye can scarcely recognise the handsome face I was so proud of three days ago,\" was her mournful caution as she led the way across the hall to the extemporised chamber. But no caution could have prepared Alice for the change she witnessed. Wan and ghastly she expected to find him ; but the sight which met her view quite over powered her. His beautiful black curls had been"], [115, "THROUGH the plantation. 107 shaved away, and cloths steeped in cooling lotion lay on the bald scalp. His restless eyes held a fiery light never before seen there by her ; they Avere sunken in their sockets, and encircled by dark rims. The flush of fever had subsided for a brief interval, leaving him white as the sheet which covered him ; one hand lay outside the coverlet, and on his little finger Avas a ring which Alice knew. It was formed from a curl stolen from her school-girl crop ; and called back meetings Avhich contrasted, oh, how painfully with this ! Poor Alice ! he lay there, fortunately for her, not raving, but utterly unconscious of her presence ; help less and oblivious of all around him. Ph\u0153be sat at the foot of the bed with swollen face and eyes ; Mrs. Emery, too, Avas there, and Mr. Gresham, who rose on the entrance of Miss Ford. \" This is a lamentable sight for friendly eyes,\" said he, addressing her, and pointing to the form stretched on the mattress-bed before him, but he is quieter now than he has been since yesterday noon, and if he does not relapse within the present hour, he may yet be spared to our prayers. We can only hope and pray. This is a crisis.\" Alice could not answer ; a mist seemed gathering over her eyes, but she took the seat Mr. Gresham resigned to her in perfect silence, and he, with a"], [116, "108 god's providence house. delicacy she afterwards remembered and appreciated, boAved and left the room. At a sign from Madam Latham, Ph\u0153be and the housekeeper followed, and the two Avere left alone with their treasure and their tears. Alice's fell fast \u2014 sudden emotions of joy or sorroAv, a kind word unexpected, the sight of suffering, could ever stir their founts, though harshness or in justice froze them at their source : and now many and. varied feelings called them forth, and they flowed freely. One thought was knocking at the doors of her heart Avith a reproachful sound \u2014 \" It Avas through me ! It was through me ! Had he not gone for the miniature, this might never have happened ! It was through me ! \" Soon she kneeled by the bedside, and taking his thin hand in hers, laid her wet cheek against it, but roused no answer in his vacant eye. The hunting-watch, Avhich had been wound up and hung at his bed-head, ran a race Avith her heart, and as she watched the tiny fingers move, and heard the tick-tacks running away on busy feet AAith the hour's short store of minutes, her tears stopped, and she listened in silent expectancy. \" Alice, my dear,\" whispered Madam Latham, aster a long pause, \" speak to him. Who knows but the tones of your voice may call his memory back ? \" \" George,\" murmured the miserable girl, \" George !\" No sign of intelligence. She kissed the hand she"], [117, "through the plantation. 109 held, and slightly raised her voice, \"George, dear, dear George.\" A faint smile flitted across his face, his hand lightly closed on hers, and his lips moved, but there the recognition ended. The hands, how ever, remained clasped, his eyes closed, and before the restless ticking feet had raced out quite the hour, he was asleep. That Avas a favourable symptom, Mr. Gresham said when he returned ; and everything depended on per fect quietude, and the object which first met the patient's eye on awaking. That had been Dr. Wims low's dictum, and there was no reason to doubt it. Alice continued to kneel there, with the loved hand on hers, afraid to move lest she should awake the sleeper prematurely, until her position became absolutely painful. Madam Latham, per ceiving her Aveariness. brought her a low stool, on which she seated herself without displacing George's clasping hand. How slowly the tick-tacks trod out the lingering moments then ! As she listened to the faint breath and the slow tick-tack, tick-tack, tick tack, or glanced from the Avhite face on the pilloAV to the white face on the wall, her heart held a double anxiety : and her father's angry face rose before her, stern and threatening1. She could not quit George thus, could not unclasp that hand and leave another to supply her place, when an hour or two might give"], [118, "110 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. him back to life and love ! Impossible ! The dis pleasure she had braved in coming could not be heightened much by the length of her stay ; at all events she must risk it. George's life outweighed her father's anger. It was little more than two o'clock when Alice reached the Lodge, but those tiny golden hands had pointed to three, and four, and five, yet she was still a watcher. At four, a cup of tea had been brought to the bed-side, but she drank it without eating, or disturbing the sleeper. His breathing grew gradually more calm and regular, and a quarter before six he slowly unclosed his eyes. That Avas an anxious moment for his watching friends. The room was dimly lighted, and his weak sight met no glare ; but as the blue eyes opened, the pupils, no longer dark, but light and dull with pain, rested on the gentle face he had seen in his dreams, not vacantly, but with the mind awakened too. \" Alice,\" said he faintly, \" Are you here ? I have been dreaming of you ! \" \" Hush ! George, dear, you must not speak until you are stronger. Let me give you this medicine.\" And mastering her strong emotion, lest she should agitate him, she spoke calmly, and poured the draught slowly into his opened mouth, with a composure she Avas far from feeling."], [119, "THROUGH THE PLANTATION. 111 Madam Latham, in thankful gratitude, stood by watching her with unmixed admiration, and Mr. Gresham shared the feeling. George glanced from her to his mother, slightly raised his feeble hand, Avhich the old lady pressed gently, and then turned his inquiring eyes again to Alice, who put a finger to her lip, and bending down over him, whispered, \" Dear George, you must lie still. Do keep quiet, for my sake.\" \" Kiss me, Alice, and I will,\" he answered. Alice blushed rosy red \u2014 for was not Mr. Gresham there \u2014 but that was no time for prudery, so she obeyed ; and his eyes and clasping hand thanked her. Dr. WimsloAV and Mr. Prestbury were announced. They felt their patient's pulse in succession, looked at his tongue, examined the wound, and the strapping of the leg ; whilst Alice, in a state of anxiety, awaited their opinion in another room. Before long they entered, accompanied by Madam Latham, and after bowing to Alice very graciously, Dr. Wimslow, for himself and colleague, proceeded to pronounce judgment. He was a puffy little man, Avith a short neck and a rubicund complexion, suggestive of port wine and apoplexy, and had been physician, by appointment, to the Misses Briscoe's pupils, so the features of Alice were familiar to him. Both himself and the surgeon were dressed in black from head to"], [120, "112 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. heel, with the exception of the white cambric ruffles, and the neck-tie with falling ends. Their three-cor nered hats \u2014 when Avorn \u2014 rested on -ample powdered wigs, differing only in the finish of the queue : the M.D.'s boasted a bag ; the surgeon's rejoiced in a ribbon tie. Fortifying himself against the cold ride from a decanter on the table, Dr. Wimslow said gravely, with frequent glances at his companion (who, by the way, stood almost as high in the profession as himself, and much higher in stature), and as frequent pauses \u2014 \" We think, my dear Madam, there is a decided \u2014 um-a \u2014 change for the better \u2014 um-a \u2014 in your amiable son\" (a glance at Mr. Prestbury, who bows assent). \" We are \u2014 um-a \u2014 of opinion that \u2014 um-a \u2014 the fever has considerably abated \u2014 um-a \u2014 \" (glance and assenting bow), \" and \u2014 a \u2014 that the pulse is remarkably reduced \u2014 um-a.\" \" Low, in fact,\" interposes Mr. Prestbury, responding to another glance. \" Yes \u2014 low \u2014 decidedly low \u2014 um-a \u2014 but\u2014 a \u2014 that we \u2014 um-a \u2014 must expect.

Good evening ! \" The men of pills and draughts, probes and lances, departed ; and Alice returned to George's room for a few moments. Already she had outstayed the limit she had assigned herself ; and she knew that a longer absence from her father's roof would cause alarm as well as anger. The inmates of the Grange were ordinarily in bed by eight o'clock, and it wanted little more than half-an-hour to that time. Stooping VOL. II. I"], [122, "114 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. over the prostrate form of George, she whispered gently, \" I am going home now, George, but will return before long, be assured.\" \" When, my Alice ? \" feebly asked her lover. \" I cannot tell. I came Avithout my father's know ledge now ; I must do so again, I suppose, when I repeat my visit. Keep still and quiet in my absence, and I may find you better. Good night, dear George. God bless you ! \" \" God bless you, dearest, good night ! \" Again she bent doAvn her red lips to his Avhite ones, and, giving her hand to his mother, left the room, tears standing in her eyes. Mr. Gresham folloAved, and offered to escort Miss Ford to the Grange, Madam Latham urging the necessity of a com panion, as the road Avas lonely, and the sky cloudy. Tom should accompany them Avith a lantern, she said. Alice had resumed hat and cloak Avhilst the doctors inspected their patient, and Mrs. Latham pointing to the great-coat, which, since George's disaster had fallen to Mr. Gresham's lot, the gentle man thrust his arms in ; and aster a hastily whispered request that word should be sent by Ph\u0153be, to tell of any change in George, or of his progress, and a loving embrace of the gentle matron, attended by her two squires, the tearful girl hurried down the stone steps, and along the side walk to the plantation."], [123, "THROUGH THE PLANTATION. 115 \" Would you not prefer the ordinary path, Miss Ford ; this one is rarely used ? \" asked the curate. \" I came this way, sir, thank you, and am not at all timid. It is a shorter distance, and I am in haste.\" \" Very good, all paths are alike to me,\" answered he ; then turning to the man \u2014 \" Tom, have the goodness to go before with the light ; it is very dark under these trees ; \" and Tom obeyed, the lantern barely serving to light up the narrow strip of snow on Avhich they trod. The night Avas cloudy and dark, fitful gusts of wind swept through the trees, and drove the snow in shoAvers around them ; the boughs of the heavy cedars swayed and Creaked against each other, and the blasts moaned and sobbed amongst the leafless branches of oak, elm, and sycamore. They had traversed about half the distance, when they saw a dark figure coming along the path in- a contrary direction. As the figure neared them, Tom held his lantern up, so that the light fell on the person's face, and Alice, not -without surprise, recognised the un welcome features of Mr. Heywood. She had been conversing seriously, but cheerfully, with Mr. Gresham, or rather, she had been listening to favourable anecdotes, and a Avarm eulogium of George, uttered in perfect good faith by the poor curate, whose opportunities of testing the worth i 2"], [124, "GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. 116 of Mr. Latham had been frequent, They were ac cepted by the young girl's ready ear with as complete a trust : Avhat he had been proud to testify, she had been as proud to believe ; the theme Avas an agreeable one to both, and no little displeasure clouded her features at the unexpected interruption. A dark scowl Avas on the handsome face, lit up by the lantern, but it passed quickly, and broke into a smile as he stepped forward and took the hand of Alice, as something to Avhich he had a right, answer ing her abrupt exclamation \u2014 \" Mr. Heywood, you here ! \" \" Of course ! Where should I be, dear Alice, when you Avere returning home alone ? I could not foresee that you would have any other protector ;\" and the very slightest tinge of bitterness was in his tone. \" Your father is greatly disturbed by your absence, and Mrs. Ford much alarmed,\" added he, as a sort of justification of his presence. \"There was no necessity for alarm. Mrs. Latham was certain to send her young friend home under sufficient guardianship,\" said Mr. Gresham quietly.

At the Griffin-gate Mr. Gresham paused, and, addressing Alice, said, \" As you are now at yrour father's gate, Miss Ford, and have an efficient pro tector, I will take my leave. I am anxious to return to my sick friend, and therefore I rely on your good nature to excuse my abrupt departure.\" \"No apology is necessary, Mr. Gresham; \"I am obliged to you for your attention so far,\" answered Alice, aloud, adding, in tones too low to catch Mr"], [127, "THROUGH THE PLANTATION. 119 Heywood's listening ear, \"Should you speak of our meeting with this gentleman on your return to the Lodge pray let it be only to Madam Latham ; on no account mention it to Mr. George, he would be distressed and discomposed by it.\" \" I shall not forget a caution so considerate, and thank you on Mr. Latham's behalf,\" then, raising his voice, which had sunk to a level with hers, he bade both herself and Mr. Heywood a kind good-night, shaking the hand she extended to him in cordial friendliness. \" Good-night, Tom, and thank you for your light,\" said Alice, pleasantly nodding to the man. \" Good-neeght, Miss, an' thenk yo for comin to tend ar young measter ! \" quoth the man, turning as he spoke, and swinging the lantern from his shoulder again, so as to light the clergyman through the wicket. Mr. Heywood, not in the best of moods, had ground his teeth during this colloquy, in which he had no part, and he closed the Griffin-gate fiercely, with a muttered Avish that he could as easily shut out the Latham's from the Grange for ever.

Alice had walked forward whilst he Avas thus occupied, but he stepped on briskly after her, and Avould again have drawn her arm within his, but she repulsed him Avith some dignity. \" How is this, my dear Alice ? You accepted the support of my arm in the plantation ? \" asked he, Avith much surprise. \" I cannot possibly have offended you in so short a time ! \" \" If I accepted your arm then, Mr. HeyAVOod,\" replied Alice, loftily, \"it was because I did not choose to insult my father's guest in the presence of a stranger, and had you shown an equal consideration for my feelings the annoyance of this repulse might have been spared you.

But I could not suffer you to indulge in a belief I could tolerate a rejuetition of such familiarity.

BURNT FINGERS. Until the assembly of the family at the tea table, the absence of Alice from the Grange was not generally known. Umvilling to inculpate her mother, or expose her for an instant to her father's certain displeasure, the thoughtful and generous girl left the house whilst her mother paid a cus tomary afternoon visit to the dairy and press-room. When missed by Mrs. Ford, her consternation was great. She had heard her daughter announce to Mr. Gresham an intention to visit the Lathams, but that she would dare to do \"so a second time in the face of her father's express injunction, she could not believe ; and not until Peggy stated that she had fastened Miss Alice's clogs could the mother realise the astounding fact.

At four o'clock, their ordinary tea-hour, Dick was despatched in haste to the village to meet and hurry his young mistress homeward, Avhilst Mrs. Ford delayed the meal in the anxious hope to screen her daughter's departure from Michael. Of course, the good creature's kindly intentions Avere futile, and Avorse, for her mes senger did not return. Dick had been seen by some of his new acquaintances in Shotwick, pounced upon immediately, and involved in a discussion respecting the marvellous appearance of the ghost the previous night. If anything, Dick was a more dogged disbeliever in spectres than his master ; and consequently Avhen he was almost borne into the Black Bear by the curious and superstitious crowd, pressed to drink, and pressed to confirm the Avondrous stories afloat, he laughed and remonstrated by turns. Mat was in the chimney corner, heavy and stupid and sottish, and there he had been all day, Avhilst anvil and hammers lay idle. He had just intelligence enough to under stand the subject under dispute, and bounced upon his unsteady legs to swear with some very foul oaths that he, Mat Spark, had seen the ghost, and \" seeing Avor believin ! \" So anxious was Dick to convince"], [137, "BURNT FINGERS. 129 Mat he had not seen the ghost, and there never was or would be such a thing seen anywhere, that he forgot the urgency of his errand, and lingered until he felt convinced he had missed Miss Alice, and might as well stay where he was; unconscious that a storm was brewing at home much stronger than Ralph's ale or his own arguments. From his exploration of panels and wainscoting, Michael had returned with the uncomfortable feelings of a man who has failed to discover that which he had felt assured he should find. Artfully inoculated by Mr. Heywood with the belief that his neighbour was the evil spirit haunting the Grange, the virus spread through his stubborn mind, and hour by hour the opinion became more deeply rooted. But if a Latham \u2014 whether uncle or nephew \u2014 played the ghost there, he must come in a palpable body, and have some mode of ingress and egress, and that entrance they had been foiled in their attempts to discover. A building, however, containing three distinct stair cases, and as many separate entrances, where the centre and wings were so far apart, and only con nected by long passages, was peculiarly fitted for the undetected nocturnal visitations of any one possessing a master key to the outer locks. This facility Michael decided on rectifying on the instant, and, still accompanied by Mr. Heywood, passed through VOL. II. E"], [138, "130 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. that gentleman's chamber into his own, thence down the side stairs into the dairy, and so out into the courtyard, in quest of Dick. He had determined on sending the man post-haste to Mr. Peover for a locksmith to change the locks that night. But on looking round for Dick, no Dick Avas to be found, and neither Ben nor Sam knew where he had gone. Formerly this would have created no surprise ; nor, unless some great neglect had been apparent, would it have roused the ire of his master ; but when suspicion entered Michael's heart, a troop of retainers followed, irritabdity being chief; and therefore the unwonted absence of his trusty servant just when needed \u2014 one disappointment close on the heels of another \u2014 was a spur in the sides of his temper little required. He sent the cow-boy and ploughman hither and thither in search of the missing man, and they might be heard bawling \" Deak ! Deak ! \" -with very sten torian voices in barns, hay-lofts, granary, orchard, and stack-yard, whilst Michael fumed and stamped about stable and shippons. He was not habitually choleric ; but a very thick skin beaten by a nettle becomes sensitive and irri tated, and the imperturbable Mr. Heywood had been precisely such a nettle to the determined yeoman. Resolute he had ever been, and when roused to"], [139, "BURNT FINGERS. 131 anger, which Avas but seldom, his rage was over powering. Surprised to witness this outburst Avith so little apparent reason, Sam and Ben hurried about in quest of their fellow, but took care to keep at a respectful distance from their master themselves, lest they should perchance come in for a share of his ill humour. Dick not being forthcoming, Mr. Ford, -with his shadow still by his side, entered the house by the kitchen door. In the front of the glowing kitchen fire stood Peggy, in all the glory of leather stays, linsey gown, and petticoat, spotless apron, cap, and neckerchief. With her healthy face, reddened by the heat, she stood turning a wheat-cake, destined for the tea-table, upon the bakestone, and so intent wasshe upon her occupation, she did not observe who it was entered the kitchen, until roused by Michael's abrupt inquiry, \" Peggy, Avhere's Dick ? \" \" Whoi, oi reckon he'll be stayen at th' village, as he hanna corned back.\" \" What has he gone to the village for ?

But he strode through the short passage into the parlour (whither his com panion had preceded him), closing both doors of communication behind him, looking as though he thought it was not \" very well :\" leaving the three tenants of the kitchen to discuss his words and man ner after their own fashion Peggy and Sally, through years of experience, had learned to decipher both, and the interpretation of the maids now was that a storm was brewing. \" Oi telled thee, Betty, not to stir th' batter for th' cakes wi' a knoife ; thee knows \u2014 ' If yo stir wi' a knoife YoTl stir up stroife,' an' moi neame's not Peggy if there beant a storm i' the pleace afore long.

Here, tak this cake, an dunna yo spare the butter, or yo'll get a taste o'th hot temper.\" And so the three continued to discuss their master's mood, and marvelled what had occurred to disturb him so greatly. The fire shone brightly when Michael entered the twilight room : on the table were the unlit candles, the tea-board with its quaint array of primitive cups and saucers, the attendant japanned tea-caddy, the never-failing Christmas pie, collared brawn, hung beef, and other savories ; and on a brass stand before the flaring fire, the quaint little teapot rested to brew the tea. The leaping flames lit up the room within their radius, and Avere reflected from the silver race cups and vases, and in the wax-polish of chairs and buffet, but the deep bay-window lay in shadow ; and there Margaret Ford stood, half hid by the heavy * Sieving."], [142, "134 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. moreen curtains, looking out down the long drive, with timid tearful eyes, for the form then seated yet more anxiously by George Latham's bedside. She had been afraid all along of Michael's return, and listened for his step ; yet, uoav that he came, was so intently striving to pierce the gathering gloom for Avhat would not appear to soothe her, that she failed to hear him close the door and come forward. At first neither of the gentlemen perceived her ; but when Michael, taking a spill from a Derbyshire spar-stand on the mantelshelf, lit the candles; startled by the light she turned round, and he at once accosted her Avith \u2014 \" Margaret, Avhere have you sent Dick off to ? \" in tones as composed as he could muster. \" Well I \u2014 ,\" she replied timidly \u2014 \" I have sent him \u2014 but do you want him, Michael ? \" \" Want him, yes, imperatively. But where is he ? and why does not Alice come to tea ? it is almost an hour beyond time ! \" asked he in quick succession. \" I hope my dear girl is not keeping her room from indisposition,\" appended Mr. Heywood. \"She complained she was not well this morning.\" Mrs. Ford hesitated, not knowing Avhich question to answer first, half-inclined to take refuge in Mr. Heywood's unintentional suggestion, and by a subter fuge hide her daughter's absence. But her implicit faith in her husband's infallibility, and his clearness"], [143, "BURNT FINGERS. 135 of perception, which Avould, she thought, be sure to render such attempt abortive, checked the half-formed intention, and so, anxious by any means to gain time, she replied to the first question, \u2014 \" I sent Dick on an errand to Shotwick,\" adding hastily, as she stooped to lift the teapot, \u2014 \" Had we not better have our tea? it is quite ready. Peggy will bring in the wheat-cakes. Will you oblige me by ringing the bell, Mr. Heywood ?\" Mr. Heywood arose to comply, but Michael arrested his hand. \u2014 \u2022\" Not until Alice comes,\" said he ; \" I will go and call her. Where is she, Margaret ? \" Driven into a corner, timid Mrs. Ford had no resource but to answer the direct question, which she did, very hesitatingly, \u2014 \"I am sure I cannot tell, Michael ; I have not seen her since dinner.\" \" Not seen her since dinner ! \" repeated Mr. Ford, whilst Mr. Heywood opened his cold grey eyes in wonder. \" Have you not inquired, or looked for her ? \" \" Certainly, Michael, I have looked ; but think she has gone out, for her clogs are not in the rack.\" (She did not say that Peggy had fastened the clogs.) \" Out, and without our knowledge ! \" exclaimed Michael, in utter dismay ; then, looking stedfastly at his trembling wife, as if to read her very heart, he asked her, slowly and deliberately\u2014\" Margaret, are"], [144, "136 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. you sure you know nothing of this ? \u2014 sure you have not connived at her going? There is no question Avhere the disobedient girl is gone,\" added he. \" Indeed, Michael, she went unknown to me, whilst I was in the dairy. I sent Dick out to look for her.\" There was something so new to Michael in the fact that Alice had left the house (even for a stroll) with out communicating her intention and destination to her mother, that for a few moments surprise held him speechless. But his displeasure gathered strength thereby, and the fresh annoyance obliterated the former for a time. Seating himself in gloomy silence, he suffered the bell to be rung, the cakes brought, and tea poured out, whilst he, with folded arms, sat looking in the fire ; seeing, not the fire, but a stubborn, wilful girl, running counter to his Avishes, defeating his plans, in league Avith his only enemies, and braving him openly, \u2014 and that, too, before Robert ! \u2014 What, he thought, would be Robert's opinion of her now ? would he still persevere in his suit ; or would he cast her off as unworthy Ids affec tion ? And as he mused thus he turned half round, and glanced at Mr. Heywood, as if to read his opinion in his countenance. But the immobile fea tures were blank ; the gentleman sipped his tea, and ate wheat-cakes and hung-beef with so stolid a look"], [145, "BURNT FINGERS. 137 that no one would have suspected the tempest raging in the heart beneath. Michael did not, at least ; so he turned again to his consultation with the fire, leaving his tea untouched. At length, recalled to himself by Margaret, he ate and drank heartily, but with little consciousness what viands he swallowed ; and answered occasional re marks made by his wife or guest very much at random. He felt towards Mr. Heywood a debt of gratitude he could only cancel by the surrender of his chief treasure, his peerless daughter ; and she, sud denly reversing the tenour of her whole life, had sprung up armed to confront him, and resist, unnatu rally and ungratefully, this bestowal of her hand, Avith an obstinacy he never saAv equalled. \u2014 (In Michael's own opinion he was not obstinate, only determined.) But he had promised her to Robert, and honour forbade that he should forfeit his word, were her own choice even in a less objectionable quarter ; but haring fallen on a Latham, it became his duty as a father to restrain and direct her. Yes, his duty ! and what was hers but obedience ? and obedience he would have ! The tea-table had been cleared, the hearth swept, the candles snuffed, Mr. Heywood and Mrs. Ford conversed occasionally, in under-tones, on the possi bdities and probabilities attending the absence of"], [146, "138 god's providence house. Alice, whilst her father held converse AA-ith himself and the red fire, and warmed his indignation at the bars. With his rising wrath he rose, as was his Avont when irritated, and strode about the room. The clock in the adjoining kitchen hammered down the hours as they died, and Avith every stroke the frown on Michael's brow deepened. The door into the kitchen had not been closed behind Peggy, and about seven o'clock Dick's loud A-oice, somewhat thicker than usual, proclaimed his presence. Angrily summoning him into his pre sence, his master demanded where the man had been, and why he had not returned earlier ; then, Avithout Avaiting a reply, bade him saddle a horse, and ride OA7er to Chester, at once, to bid Mr. Peover send a locksmith in the morning without fail. \" To-neeght, measter ! \" exclaimed Dick, in un pleasant astonishment, evidently not relishing the journey so near to his oavii bed-time. \" Yes, to-night ! Had you returned earlier you would have gone earlier; but go you must.\" \"Mr. Ford,\" interrupted Mr. Heywood, very7 sud denly, as though a new light had broken in upon him, rising and approaching Michael, so that their speech might not reach other ears, \" Do not you think Mr. Peover likely to send the smith who put"], [147, "BURNT FINGERS. 139 the present locks on the doors? If so, the change of locks might be no advantage.\" \" You are right, Robert, quite right ; I never thought of that. Hoav clear-sighted you are ! Whom should I send to, then ? I know no locksmith nearer Northwich. Do you ? \" \" Well, I do chance to know of a clever locksmith, though his place of business is unknown to me. I had lost my keys on one of my journeys, and the people of the inn I then frequented found me a man to pick the lock of my valise, and fit keys to the locks of my goods' cases ; he appeared a skilful workman, though with a very rough exterior.\" \" Never mind his looks, if he is a good workman, and not likely to be connected with those rascally Lathams. But Avhere can Dick find this man ? \" asked Michael, pleased with Robert's quickness to discover a difficulty, and promptness to help him out of it. \"At the Yacht Inn, I should think. Dick has only occasion to say that Mr. Heywood, of Manchester, has recommended John Tonks, the locksmith, to work for you, and the landlord will be sure to find the man, if only to oblige me,\" replied Mr. Heywood, very calmly. Michael thereupon thanked Mr. Heywood, and despatched Dick on his errand, notwithstanding the"], [148, "140 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. man's faint protest against it, or the low grumbling of Peggy, Avho did not approve of her sweetheart's absence during the hour usually devoted to courtship. Dick gone, thought and conversation reverted to the still absent Alice ; Mrs. Ford fidgeted about, sat down, smoothed her dress, took her knitting from a work-basket, and tried to hide her uneasiness by turning the heel of a stocking ; but she dropped her stitches, and could not pick them up again, then a pin fell to the ground, and, as she stooped to raise it, she roved her work, and her trembling hands could scarcely replace the knitting-pins in the stitches ; so, finding the experiment a bad one, she quietly re turned the unfinished stocking to the basket, and, unable to sit still, walked into the kitchen, as she said, \" to see about supper.\" As she lest the room, Mr. Ford, turning to Mr. Heywood, said, \" Robert, what do you think of Alice noAv ? I am ashamed of her.\" As I ever did, Mr. Ford,\" was the decided answer. \" I should be less than man did I not feel acutely her undisguised preference for another; but that does not affect my love for her, nor alter my belief that time may wean her from him, and restore her to me.\" It is noteworthy that the seemingly sanguine man always spoke of her to Michael as of one once his"], [149, "BURNT FINGERS. 141 own, beguiled from her first love, but only for a season, and to be won back by constancy. \" I hope you may find it so ! for my part this day's disobedience has done more to destroy my faith in the girl than I could have thought possible,\" re sponded Michael, sorrowfully. Then added, with & changed tone, as he looked at his huge orange-shaped watch, \" It is more than half-past seven and she has not thought proper to walk home. By jingo ! but I'll bring her back, and that pretty sharply !\" and he grasped the hat he had thrown down on his entrance. \"Shall I go to meet her, my dear sir? I am de sirous of a little private conversation Avith Alice, and have hitherto had no opportunity. Besides, as you are good enough to promise she shall ultimately belong to me, the sooner I exercise the privileges of my position the better,\" interposed Mr. Heywood, earnestly. \" So I think, Robert, and you are at liberty to take my place with all my heart. It is an ungracious office to-night. However, I'll put matters on another footing when she does come home, you'll see ;\" and Michael threw down his hat and helped his pros pective son-in-laAv on with his coat ; opened the door, aud watched him down the path, the gusts of wind which swept the snow up in his face, serving only to fan his smouldering temper to a blaze. Closing the"], [150, "142 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. door with a bang, Avhich sent a peal of echoes chasing each other up the staircase, and along the corridors, he strode over the diamond tiles with resonant steps, backAvards and forwards ; not caring to meet his quiet wife in his unquiet frame of mind ; and with every turn in his walk his irritability increased. Thus it was that Alice on her entrance into the hall confronted her father first. \" Well, miss, and where have you been until this hour without our knowledge ? \" was Michael's sharp salutation. \" Where my duty called me, father, by the bedside of a great sufferer ! \" was the answer of Alice, nerved to composure even by the demands on her self-com mand during the day. \" Say George Latham at once, and don't beat about the bush !\" testily exclaimed Michael. \" There is no necessity. I am not ashamed to own where I have been. I have been with George Latham. Common humanity called me thither, even if duty had been dumb ! \" and conscious of the integrity of her motives, the single-minded girl paused for no reply, but turned into the corridor on her way to the parlour, Avhither Mr. Heywood, to escape being drawn into a perplexing scene, had preceded her. Michael, however, followed closely, taking up the theme she had dropped."], [151, "BURNT FINGERS. 143 \" Duty indeed ! do you call disobedience a duty, miss ? and common humanity \u2014 fiddlestick ! Would common humanity have called you elsewhere, had a stranger been lamed, instead of that Avhite-faced curly-headed boy ? \" asked he, Avith a sneer. \" I should hope so ! \" was her calm reply ; \" but as a neighbour, as a very old friend, was lying between life and death, duty did call me to the Lodge, even had no stronger motive prompted.\" \" And pray, miss, what stronger motive could you have than Avhat you call duty ? \" \"I think, father, it is scarcely necessary to remind you that Mr. Latham has a higher claim on me than either as neighbour or friend,\" responded she, her voice faltering for the first time, and her eyelids drooping. \" I acknowledge no such claim, and you know it. How dare you thrust that reason forward, to excuse your unmaidenly visit? No one has any claim on you but Robert there, and his claim I approve.\" \u2022'And I do not!\" resolutely answered Alice, as she unclasped her cloak, and stood there hat in hand \u2014 not boldly defiant, but with a quiet determi nation, no force could overpower, no subtlety could baffle. \"No matter whether you do or you do not \u2014 / acknowledge Robert's pretensions, and you will wed"], [152, "144 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. him all the same,\" quickly followed up Michael, with much temper. \" Pardon me,\" interposed Mr. Heywood, with grave seriousness, \" it does matter materially. I seek the love of Alice as well as her hand.\" \"And that, Mr. Heywood, I have already told you, you cannot have,\" said Alice. \" And I have already replied, that time works great changes, and I can wait. I say not this of fensively, Alice, but with the trust of devotion and constancy.\" \" And with another trust,\" said the grey eyes, whose language none there could interpret. \" You're a fine noble fellow, Robert, \u2014 one any lass might be proud of winning, \u2014 and deserve something better than a disobedient, wilful, and impertinent girl like this.\" \" But hark ye, miss, you go no more near George Latham, or his home, that I'll take care of. And you will receive my generous preserver's addresses with a better grace, or it will be worse for you.\" \"I can make no promises I should be sure to break; as a friend, and as your guest, I am willing to receive Mr. Heywood, but nothing more : and until George Latham is restored to health, I must go occasionally to the Lodge,\" was Alice's steady re sponse. \" How dare you, madam, set your will in array"], [153, "BURNT FINGERS. 145 against mine ? By jingo ! you had better not attempt to visit the Lodge a third time ! \" \" Father,\" said Alice, speaking Avith an effort, and holding both hands on her side, as if to still her heart's throbbing, \" Father, I have never failed in my duty or obedience to you untd now ; nor would I now, but the call is imperative.\" She stood by the table as she spoke, almost in front of the fire, her father facing her, and Robert Hey wood, looking grieved at the contention, by her left hand. Suddenly her father spied the slender chain attached to George's miniature, and losing the little self-control left him, stetched forward, and plucking at it, the clasp gave way, and the locket was dragged from its rest. With an angry exclamation he threw chain and miniature both into the fire, and looked as if he had achieved a victory. Quick as thought Alice darted forward, and heed less of consequences, thrust her hand into the flames, and rescued her great treasure, that Avhich had been bought Avith her lover's blood, perchance with his life. The glass was cracked with the heat, and the gold was insufferably hot, but she held it fast never theless, lest it should be again torn from her ; and though it burned her already scorched hand, she grasped it tightly, and, drawn to her full height, with a tone \u2014 oh ! how changed \u2014 said, \" You see what I will vol. n. L"], [154, "146 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. dare for the painted semblance ! judge Avhat I will brave for the living reality. Obedience ceases when injustice and cruelty begin.\" And without another Avord she gathered up her falling cloak, and SAvept from the room with inherent dignity and firm re solve. To her chamber she went, without lamp or candle ; the pain at her heart overpowering the pain of her burned hand, and shutting out all thought of evil spirits, save the evil spirit prompting her father's severity. Braved in his own house, for the first time, Michael stood amazed ; but Mr. Heywood, Avith a truer in sight into character, had a foreboding of such a climax. How to impress the self-opinionated man Avith a conviction of the impolicy of his own course of action Avas a difficulty, but the wily man had long ago discovered that Mr. Ford Avould listen to him, though deaf to every one else ; and so, when amaze ment gave place to passion, and it broke from his lips in the hurried half-choked words, \" By jingo ! I'll not stand this \u2014 I'll make her smart for her assurance,\" Mr. Heywood replied soothingly, \" My dear Mr. Ford, I may err in judgment, but I certainly incline to think Alice might be won to our views by a different mode of treatment. I believe she must be led by an invisible string ; and coercion will but rouse her to more determined opposition.\""], [155, "BURNT FINGERS. 147 \"Ah, it's all very well for you to say so noAv, Robert; but only wait until you are married, and have a right to her obedience, and you'll be as sure to exact it as I am, and chafe as sorely when braved as I have been.\" Mr. Ford never made a truer shot. Mr. Heywood, smooth as the velvet he dealt in, booked to Alice's account every pang she made him suffer, every cold word or look or tone of hers, every grip he had given his temper to keep it under, and the items swelled into a goodly debt to be repaid with interest when he was sure of his prize. Now he only replied to the random stroke, \" I think not : I am for gentler modes of dealing with the gentle sex. Like my* silks and satins, they require delicate handling ; and I hope I should be as considerate a husband as a Avooer, if only for the sake of having my own way in the end.\" Michael shook his head dissentingly as he answered the mild dogma with the result of his ruder theory. \" If I have a restive horse, I curb and whip it into submission. I have never before had a restive woman to deal with ; but, by jingo ! I'll tame the one I have now ! \" I regret that you should consider strong measures necessary ; but for Heaven's sake, Mr. Ford, withhold any active steps until after my departure. I should be certain to interpose to shield my dear girl from L 2"], [156, "148 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. your anger, however just ; and should only offend you without conciliating Alice, Avho attributes to me your distrust of Mr. Latham.\" The entrance of Peggy to lay the supper-cloth put a stop to the conversation ; and with the supper came in Mrs. Ford, with red eyes and mottled face, the signs of recent tears ; for though she had purposely left the room, fearing to participate in a quarrel, she closed but the one door after her, and the tones of her husband's ordinarily loud voice (according well with his stalwart frame), now raised to an angry pitch, smote her sensitive ear and heart like painful blows, and tears had sprung unbidden. Servants did not shut their1 ears then more than now, even if they kept their lips close, with more regard for the interests or feelings of those they served, and the angry voice had been heard by all in the kitchen. Consequently, when Peggy's sharp eyes missed Alice from the par lour, her Avomanly sympathies were roused, and her perceptions. \"If that wench hasna gone to bed ith dark, my neame's not Peggy ! Oi wonder measter con foind i' his heart to blow up i' such a fashion Avhen th' poor wench's sweetheart's leein' a deein'. Oi couldna ha' dun it.\" \" Leein' a deein' !

But the wind Avas too sharp for her ; twice she had to come back with an extinguished light. Then, wiser grown, she borrowed Ben's lantern, remembering she had also to return, and liked the dark much less than her young mistress seemed to do, and then with the lantern and unlit candle both, stepped carefully through the dairy, upstairs to the door of Alice's chamber (the one which opened on the landing), and tapped several times before she received an ansAver. \"Who's there ?\" asked a husky voice, very unlike Alice's sweet tones. \" It's mea, Ailse, oi've browght thee a leeght,\" called the faithful adherent through the keyhole. \" Very well, Peggy, come in ! \" was the faint but still husky reply. On entering, she was told to put down the light, \u2014 an intimation, as Peggy took it, that her further attendance could be dispensed with.

At her feet lay hat and cloak as they had fallen when she dropped upon the coffer as the nearest seat, and bowing her head almost to her knees, sank into a dreamy stupor, from which Peggy's entrance scarcely roused her. Her mind had been kept in a state of tension the entire day ; the demands upon her patience, her spirit, and her energy, had been unusually great ; she had borne up through all, and now, the strain withdrawn, had suddenly collapsed. Pityingly and gently Peggy stooped over her, saying kindly, \" Dunna thee tak on so, Ailse \u2014 it '11 a' come reeght ith end, never fear ! Come, come, yo munna give way loike this ; look up, an' take comfort, theer's a \" She was brought to a sudden stop. She had laid one hand on the shoulder of the desponding girl as she spoke, and with the other clasped her right hand at once to express her own sympathy, and excite the attention of Alice. Her rough and indur ated palm pressing the burned and now blistered fingers forced from Alice a sharp cry of pain, and caused Peggy, with an exclamation of surprise, to release it at once."], [159, "BURNT FINGERS. 151 \" Lawka-daisy, Ailse, Avhatn maks yo so nesh ?\" * \"Nothing!

Ask missus for some elder wine, an oi'll be back for't by th' toime it's hot.\" So saying, Peggy sped across the snowy yard, where many roughly-shod feet had worn a hard and sullied track, and soon rejoined Alice; Avhom she found still seated on the coffer, but with her head leaning against the side of her bureau ; Avhere sick and faint, alike with pain of heart aud hand, she sat in listless apathy, nor roused Avheu the door opened.

After the first natural question how this accident had oc curred, the rough woman with true delicacy ceased to press inquiries Alice seemed loth to answer. She had her full share of curiosity, but forbore to gratify it at the risk of adding to the sufferings of the young lady Avhom she had served from girlhood, and loved Avell. In a short time she ran off for the wine, and brought Betty across, carrying fuel to kindle a fire in the cold room. Alice greatly needed the warm restorative, but rejected the accompanying cake : she had no appetite, and only sipped the wine at Peggy's urgent entreaty. The lubrication of the blistered hand Avas resumed, and continued unremittingly for more than an hour, the pain not abating, nor Peggy Avearying of her labour of love. And where was the mother, whose place a servant filled ? When asked for the wine, she had been told its destination and Peggy's mission, and in a flutter of anxiety had gone into the cellar for it ; why, then, did she not herself bear the cordial to her child's cold lips? Such had been her intention, but unfortunately she"], [161, "BURNT FINGERS. 153 returned to the parlour to acquaint her husband Avith an accident she presumed unknown to him. \" Michael ! \" said she, in wonderment, \" do you know Alice has burned her hand badly ?\" \" Yes, I do know, and am glad of it.

Come back, I say ; I'll have no interference between Alice and me ! \" \" But Michael ! meekly expostulated the uneasy mother. \" But Margaret ! \" sternly interrupted he, \" am I not master of my own house ? \" \" Certainly, Michael ; no one disputes that ! \" answered the placable little woman. \" Yes ; our child dares to dispute it. But she must be taught Avhat a father's authority is. This is a good first lesson.\" \" But her hand is severely burned, they say.

And the obedient wife returned to her chair by"], [162, "154 god's providence house. the fire in a tremor of anxiety, and cast an appealing look towards Mr. Heywood. But that gentleman happened at that precise moment to be regarding the embroidered portrait of Alice, hanging over the fireplace, with as much earnestness as if he were counting the stitches, and so her glance was lost ; else there can be little doubt so Arery magnanimous a lover would have made an appeal on behalf of the mother's feelings, even though in secret he held opinions and prejudices closely allied to Michael's, and in his heart of hearts echoed the words \" I am glad of it ! \" True he loved Alice, but his love was fierce and passionate, beginning and ending in selfishness, and he was secretly more glad than sorry to learn she had severely burned her fingers over his rival's portrait. But, playing the part of a generous rival, he could not well have resisted Mrs. Ford's glance, so carefully avoided seeing it, and as carefully kept aloof from the brief conversation. Soon, when it ceased, supper was resumed. Michael afterwards called for more ale, Avhich was brought in a tankard, Toby being discarded ; and lighting his long clay-pipe, smoked on in comparative silence, sending the smoke out in angry whiffs. Mr. Hey wood did not smoke \u2014 he had no bad habits \u2014 that excellent Mr. Heywood : did not smoke, nor snuff, nor even drink, but with exceeding moderation."], [163, "BURNT FINGERS. 155 The uncomfortable monotony was broken by a noise in the kitchen ; and Dick's voice being heard, Michael laid down his pipe deliberately (at the farm he Avould have gone pipe in mouth), rose slowly, and walked to the kitchen, to question his messenger. As the door closed behind him, Margaret also rose, and, trembling at her own temerity, hastened with very unusual speed to her daughter's chamber, pur posing to return before she was missed."], [164, "156 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. CHAPTER VI. JOHN TONKS. Mrs. Ford found Peggy on her knees, dropping tears, as well as goose-oil, on the smarting fingers, and Alice still on the coffer, leaning against the bureau, shivering as if from cold, and occasionally drawing her breath between her teeth \u2014 the only expression of pain she permitted to escape. Indeed she seemed in a kind of stupor, from which she did not rouse on her mother's approach, though when directly addressed she answered \u2014 but very briefly and faintly. \" Alice, dear !\" said Margaret, endeavouring to arrest her attention. \" Yes, mother !\" replied she, without looking up. \" This is very sad. How did you do it?\" \" What is sad ? \""], [165, "JOHN TONKS. 157 \"This dreadful burn !\" \" There are sadder things than scorched fingers,\" murmured Alice dreamily. \"How did you burn yourself, my poor child?\" again asked the distressed mother, adding, '' Your father said something about your thrusting your hand in the fire for a ' bauble ;' what did he mean ? You surely were not so silly.\" \" Mean ? \u2014 this !\" And Alice roused herself, thrust forward her left hand and displayed the recovered locket. \" I did snatch it from the flames, and would again were it cast there, if I burnt my fingers to the bone !\" and down the head dropped again. \" Now Missus, please, dunna y7o plague th' wench wi' anny more questions. An yo '11 hold th' bad hond, oi '11 Avrap the rags round it, an' happen it '11 be better ith mearn,\" said Peggy, unfolding her bundle of old linen. Without a thought that Peggy was taking the initiative where she herself should have directed and controlled, Mrs. Ford supported the hand which would otherwise have dropped powerless, whde Peggy swathed it in oil-steeped cloths, covering the whole with a mass of wraps, as she explained, to keep the grease from the bedclothes. \"Dear me, this is certainly very sad! and what makes it worse, your father is so angry about you ; he"], [166, "158 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Avould not let me come even to look at your hand. I slipped out, you know, while he was in the kitchen talking to Dick.\" Peggy pricked up her ears at the mention of Dick, whilst Alice languidly replied, \" Go back, mother ; let there be no anger or disunion between my father and you on my account. I have more to bear than the pain of a burned hand. But I will not draw you into a quarrel. I Avill at least suffer alone.\" \" But, Alice dear, why will you persist in going to the Lodge, when you know it displeases your father ? You really were rather to blame.\" \"I am sorry you think so, since I am likely to offend again. From this night I pursue my own course ; but I will not implicate you, dear mother, in my acts. And so I beg you will go back now : Peggy will attend to me. Thank you for coming. Kiss me. Good night !\" In a very broken and disjointed voice Alice said this ; but the breaks were caused by physical incapa city, not wavering resolution. Spirit and matter were struggling for the mastery, and the latter was winning. \" But I do not like to leave you in this state, child. I fear you are ill. Dear, dear me, what shall I do?\" exclaimed the timid little wife."], [167, "159 JOHN TONES. \" Whoi go back, missus, as fast as yo can, or measter '11 raise th' house, an' then all on us ull ketch it !\" entreated Peggy ; then adding, \" Oi' 11 bide wi' Ailse, an' see her i' bed, never yo fear !\" \" You had better go, mother.\" \" Well, I think I will. Michael would be angry if I stayed, you know ; though I really do not like to leave you, my dear child. Well ; \u2014 perhaps after all I had best go. Good night ! I hope you will sleep well, and be better in the morning.\" So saying, the kind-hearted, amiable woman (too amiable, for excess of amiability is weakness), vacil lating between her maternal love and conjugal obedi ence, departed to join her strong-headed, strong-wdled husband ; grieved to leave her child while in pain, yet afraid to add fuel to the fire of her husband's wrath by remaining. Once more, then, Alice was left to the kind offices of a domestic. But though Peggy's thoughts did stray occasionally to Dick, sitting alone on the kitchen settle, she never once dreamed of deserting her trust ; but gently and carefully disrobed her young mistress, now incapable of self-help, and half carried her to bed. Alice had relapsed into lethargy on her mother's departure, and suffered Peggy to do as she Avould, without uttering a Avord either of dissent or approba-"], [168, "160 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. tion. Her nerves had been like a tightly-strung bow since the preceding night, ready for any and all emergencies ; but the string had frayed in the using, and the last arrow, drawn to the head, had snapped it. She was quiet, but the quietude was that of inani tion : thought was busy, but one idea chased another from her mind, and even the images presented to her imagination Mere shadoAvy and indistinct. Her eyes Avere closed, and she lay perfectly still ; the hissing sound of her breath between her teeth, and an occa sional moan, alone telling the pain she suffered. Peggy, thinking Alice asleep, carefully drew the blue curtains close to exclude the light, crossed the floor on tiptoe, and seated herself on one of the rush bottomed chairs in the front of the fire, staring into its depths, with perfect good faith in her own ability to keep awake. But a December fire and a silent chamber (after a day of hard work and a previous night of merrymaking) are decidedly soporific, especially to a watcher who cannot read ; and soon the Avell-mean ing woman dozed and nodded, and after a while Avakened with a start, having all but fallen for ward into the fire. Then yawning, she took a peep at her charge, and, still mistaking the torpor for sleep, squatted on the Avarm rug (a thick pile of cloth-cuttings knitted in with a twine-w7eb), laying her red arms on the rushy seat as a pilloAv for her"], [169, "JOHN TONES. 161 head, soon was fast asleep, and snoring very unmis takably. Michael found Dick in the middle of the kitchen,, embracing himself vigorously in order to warm his frozen fingers. He Avas complaining of the Avind and cold in interjectional words, which seemed shaken out of him as it Avere by the force of the blows ad ministered by his own arms, and did not observe his master's entrance. \" The woind cuts, ugh ! \u2014 loike a, ugh ! \u2014 kneefe !

Operations common to the autumnal or early winter months had yet to be commenced, in order as far as practicable to atone for lost time, and Michael had in Dick an assistant ready to go to Avork Avith a will, and overtake the seasons if possible. Dick, munching his bread-and cheese, which he washed down Avith plentiful draughts of ale, listened attentively, and occasionally put in a word, which had to find its way to his master's ears through a barricade of food, or nodded his approba tion with a strong sense of his own importance, as * Pitchfork.

These orders given, Michael retraced his steps to the parlour, and he A\\7as lest to pursue his interrupted inquiries for Peggy, amongst his yaAvning felloAV servants, Avho, unused to late hours, were preparing for bed, little pleased at being kept up so long. Mr. Heywood, leaning against the mantelshelf, Avith his back to the windoAv and his face towards the kitchen door, was couversing in low tones with Mrs. Ford when her husband returned. She had not long regained her seat, Avas still uneasy and flurried, and but that agricultural problems were then floating in Michael's brain, he might have observed that the con versation (Avhich was about Alice's condition) dropped on his entrance. After a few words from Mrs. Ford on the evil effects of late hours (it was not half-past ten), the trio separated for the night. Mr. Heywood, as usual, preceding his host and hostess, \"who remained to secure doors Avith locks or bolts, and dismiss loitering domestics to their rest. One by one the lights in the various chambers were extinguished, weary limbs and heavy heads were laid on beds of flock or feather, and stillness reigned over the mansion. Sleep sealed every eyelid in the ser vant's Aving; but thought, often another word for"], [173, "JOHN TONES. 165 conscience, drove back sleep from the pillows of their superiors \u2014 neither Michael nor Margaret feeling thoroughly at ease respecting Alice ; and Mr. Hey wood, dropping his daylight mask, kept awake at least for an hour. Alice, poor girl, tortured mentally and bodily, lay helpless on her pillow, with closed eyes and heavy brain ; she had not slept the preceding night, and now her stupor was far removed from healthful re pose. From those delicate organs, the finger-ends, where all the nerves of sensation begin and terminate, acute pain was travelling to inform the sympathetic brain, and red-hot wires seemed to dart from their tips to her very shoulders. But the agony was in a measure dulled by the active memories of that busy day, \u2014 her watch by George's couch, the homeAvard walk with Mr. Heywood, the angry threats of her inflexible father, and the impossibility of reconciling her love and her obedience. Peggy snored, and Alice moaned, and the hours went by on feathered wings or leaden feet, and the stillness was unbroken until midnight. But when the old clock in the kitchen had Avarned his younger brother in the hall it was time to begin their hourly duet, and the first stroke of the solemn twelve woke up the echoes in the sleep-bound mansion, a loud prolonged scream, like that heard the previous night, sounded shrilly in the"], [174, "166 god's providence house. corridor, accompanied as before by a rush of feet and a heaA7y fall. Alice, roused momentarily from her lethargy, sat up in bed, then sank back ; scream and fall both con necting themselves in her mind with George Latham's fall on the road ; by some mysterious process, striking the key-note of the tune her thoughts sang. Peggy's snore stopped, she bounced to her feet and hurried to the bed, convinced that Alice had screamed in her agony, and would not be persuaded otherwise. And Mrs. Ford, lying tearfully awake, grieving over evils she knew not how to remedy, shuddered and trembled as the ill-omened shriek broke the midnight stillness, and startled Michael from his first doze. Warned by previous experience, he had kept a small hand-lamp burning, so at once, Avith the celerity of a much younger man, he sprang to the floor, and grasped the lamp and a pistol to rush in pursuit of foe or phantom. For an instant he was checked by the remembrance that the intruder Avould certaiidy escape, if to reach the corridor he must pass round from staircase to staircase; but with scarcely a pause, he muttered something, of \"no time for ceremony,\" and turned the drop handle of the door communicating with Mr. Hey wood's room. The door Avas locked. He turned the key impatiently. The door should have opened"], [175, "JOHN TONKS. 167 from him, but another impediment in the shape of a lumbering oak chair, at the back of the door, stood in the Avay. The noise and the light streaming through the chink of the doorway, apparently aroused the slumbering inmate, for a drowsy voice issuing from behind the dimity, called out \" Who's there \u2014 what do you want ? \" By this time Michael had forced an entrance, and without stopping in his course, exclaimed, \" It is I, Robert, do not be alarmed ! \" as he opened the other door, and ran along the corridor to the cheese-room, extinguishing the light in his haste, for the full grown winds disporting outside the Grange had sent a few infant breezes to gambol within the walls, and salute its master's bare limbs with very cold kisses. As might have been foreseen, he was again disap pointed. He fired his pistol in the darkness, but the momentary flash only7 lit up the gloom to reveal the room as he had left it that day. But the report roused the neighbouring servants, on whom the screams had made very little more impression than to give a tendency to restlessness. \"WTho's there?'' bawled Dick and Ben, in a breath. \" Only I, your master,\" was the reply, in as calm a tone as he could manage."], [176, "168 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. '\u2022 What's up, Measter ? \" \"Nothing, nothing, Dick \u2014 go to sleep; I thought thieves were in the house, that's all.\" The men relying on their master's truthfulness, huddled themselves under their dark woollen cover lets, and were soon soundly asleep once more ; and Michael, shivering in every limb, notwithstanding his hot temper, strode back moodily to the chamber he had left. He found Mr. Heywood wrapped in a dressing-gown prepared to follow him ; but this he now pronounced unnecessary, and with a hasty apology for disturbing his younger friend so rudely, crept to his OAvn bed much crestfallen, to ruminate once more on the perplexities and misfortunes Avhich had bristled up in his path ever since he had called the Grange his own. But of the grey eyes glittering so strangely in the darkness of the next room, as connected thereAvith, he thought only kindly, esteeming himself fortunate to have won the friendship of so gracious and worthy a gentleman. No Alice Avas at the morrow's breakfast-table, and Margaret came in, with red-rimmed eyes, having paid a visit to the Blue Chamber (as her child's was called), and found Alice suffering intensely, the pain of her singers having kept her awake the night through, and added to the excessive irritation of her nervous system. Margaret, too much alarmed for"], [177, "JOHN TONES. 169 Alice now to dread the minor evil of her husband's anger, ventured to say where she had been, and to ask him to send for a doctor. \" Is she really so ill ? \" inquired Mr. Heywood, in undisguised anxiety. He had a stake at issue on Alice's life, independently of his love, and actual illness was a serious matter. But Michael, not improved in temper by his mid night disappointment, answered roughly \u2014 \" Doctor ! I'll send for no doctor for a burnt finger;\" but he strode from tho room, and presently returned with a volume bound in calf, which he threw on the table, \" There, Margaret, consult ' Buchan,' if you want a doctor's opinion ; but don't trouble me any more about the pain of a burnt finger \u2014 so richly deserved, too.\" \" Certainly, Michael, ' Buchan ' Avill tell me Iioav to dress a burn ; but our poor child is ill besides,\" timidly appealed the sad little wife. \" Ah ! fretting perhaps, after that sneaking Latham ! Well, let her; it will do her good. She has caused me uneasiness enough with her disobe dient whims.\" \" Dear me, Michael, hoAv cross you have grown lately ! you quite put me about, you speak so sharply.\" \" Do I, my dear ? well, I did not mean it.

Alice, Avhom I have petted so much, more than all,\" re plied he in a softened tone, which induced his Avife to suggest that he should visit the invalid and judge for himself. But he was obdurate. There Avas something at Avork under the external crust, but the outer man was impenetrable. Mr. Heywood volunteered to ride for a surgeon, but Mr. Ford would not hear of it ; and the mother, armed with ' Buchan's Domestic Medi cine,' Avent back to battle Avith the burns as best she might. She AA7as overtaken on the staircase by Mr. Hey- Avood, who begged she would permit him to send a medical man, and, when her rueful shake of the head intimated that she dared not, asked permission at least to obtain for her the healing agents she might require. Together they consulted the domestic oracle, and with a commission for oil and limewater, Turner's Cerate, and Yellow Basilicon, ad lib., Mr. Heywood was speedily racing towards Chester. Near the Griffin-gate he met Ph\u0153be, on her way to the Grange, quite as pretty as ever, but not quite so coquettish. Rain had fallen early in the morning, making of the snow a slushy mire, and through this she Avalked securely on pattens ; but"], [179, "JOHN TONES. 171 the Avind was still sharp and keen, and though the hood of her red cloak Avas drawn over her close hat, it seemed to have crimsoned the cheeks beneath it with its blusterous fan. But something more^than the Avind had ruffled her cheeks and temper too, and when Mr. Heywood reined in his horse and* raised his hat to salute her (as courteously as though she had been a lady, yet overstrained perhaps), his observant eye detected signs of recent discomposure \u2014 \" Good morrow, pretty Ph\u0153be !

He was rubbing a dirty cheek with one of his dirtier hands, as though rubbing a smart into his memory rather than out of his skin, and as the horse's flank touched him, looked up with an evil scowl, and said gruffly, \" Aye, it's me !

The loving message he could not write he had confided for oral delivery ; and Madam Latham, too, had charged his ambassadress with gentle greet ings, little deeming how similar the positions of Alice and her son. Alice listened Avith quivering lip, but too prostrate to converse, only gasped out a desire that George should not know she was ill until he himself were stronger, and that a burnt finger \u2014 no more \u2014 should be named as preventing writing. Her agitation for fear lest the neAvs of her accident should re-act on her lover was great ; and, not knowing how far volatile Ph\u0153be's discretion might be trusted, she yielded to these anxieties with a morbid dread, very foreign to her strong mind.

From a copse by the Avayside, on the extreme verge of the Latham plantation, unheard by the ruminating maiden, a man emerged, and limping close at her heels, grasped her closely from behind in his long, sinewy arms, and hugging her tightly, thrust his repulsive face under her hat, and despite her struggling, almost smothered her Avith his loathsome OO O7 kisses.

Miles, however, thought no more about it. The little fluttering heart beating against his arm so rapidly had to be reassured and quieted, and very assiduously he set about the task, dismissing the man's black looks from his mind altogether. He told her that he had been to Chester with his sister, and on his return had gone to her father's, and there learned that she was at the Grange ; and also had heard of an ill-looking fellow Avho had passed through the village in the morning, and had been seen lurk ing about the road about an hour before dusk.

She and Mr. Heywood had many conferences on the subject, and after each the anxious lover urged upon his elder friend his desire to procure advice before he returned to Manchester, and always with the same result.

And yet he must know shortly.

Still he was restless in spite of himself, Avalked over the farm Avith his hands behind him, heedless of the drizzling rain which fell incessantly for two or three days, and almost as heedless of Dick's pertinacious desire to \" be up and doing \" something or other to the waste land. Mr. Heywood seemed to partake the general dis comfort. He did not care to read, and the nightly game of cribbage or backgammon became wearisome when played with a partner whose mind Avas equally abstracted from the game.

His visit was reaching its limit, yet its object was unaccomplished : he had Avon the father over, and the mother ; but Alice seemed as far removed from him as ever, and, unless her illness took a favourable turn, she was likely to slip from him altogether ; and if she went, the Grange went \u2014 um ! \u2014 perhaps not \u2014 he was a great favourite \u2014 who could tell?

All his love came back at the sight of that Avhite face, and the black circles round the sunken eyes, Avhich looked yet saw him not; and as he dropped on a chair by the bedside, he bowed his head in his hands in an agony of grief and remorse. But every feeling or emotion of Michael's was active, not passive, so after a few moments he sprang to his feet with a haste which startled his patient wife, watching meekly at the bed-foot, and rushed out of the second door, down the back stairs, out, into and across the yard to the stables, as if to atone by his speed for wilful delay.

However, your friend is certainly the better looking of the two, I must say.\" They dismounted at the porch, and soon were ushered into Alice's chamber, where this little episode was forgotten by Michael in care for his child. Mr. Prestbury had on his way thither made some inquiries from her father as to her state, but found him pro foundly ignorant of all save the fact of the burnt fingers, and their treatment as laid down by Buchan. Now the hand Avas unfolded, very gently and care-"], [205, "197 MEDICINE NOT IN THE PHARMACOP\u0152IA. fully, and Michael standing by, sickened at the sight it presented. Calling for Avarm Avater, the surgeon gently trickled the cleansing fluid over the affected parts, and where the granulation was unhealthy, cauterized them ; then tearing linen into tiny strips, spread the cerate lightly over, and wound each raw finger in a separate sheath of linen cloth. This was a painful and tedious process, and Alice, by her moans, proclaimed it such, though she othenvise re mained passive during the dressing. By the time the fingers were swathed Dr. Wimslow arrived, out of breath, and joined his more active colleague in the chamber. Questions were put and answered, pulse felt, heart felt, head felt, tongue examined, and the doctors retired for consultation. As a result a blister was ordered to be \" applied over the region of the heart,\" alegar to the temples, and unless the medicines prescribed proved efficacious by the morrow, bleeding wes pronounced indispensable. Michael was most desirous to learn the precise nature of his daughter's disease, and what chance there was of her ultimate recovery : \u2014 but no ; oracles must be ambiguous or lose their prestige by missing the mark sometimes ; and so he had to rest satisfied with the bare assurance that though the case was exceedingly doubtful, exceedingly doubtful, there Avas no immediate cause for alarm. \" Miss Ford,\" pro-"], [206, "198 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. nounced Dr. Wimslow, \" is in\u2014 um\u2014 a \u2014 an extremely critical state ;\u2014 um\u2014 a\u2014 still Ave are of opinion\u2014 um \u2014 a \u2014 that \u2014 a \u2014 her case is not beyond \u2014 um \u2014 a \u2014 the reach of science.

However, we must hope for the best.\" \u2014 And with this very indifferent conso lation Michael was obliged to be content. The doctors departed with Dick in their train (to ensure the speedy arrival of blister and medicines) long before Mr. Heywood made his appearance, so Mr. Prestbury had no further opportunity to scan the points of resemblance or difference between the -Man chester manufacturer and his Avhilom Chester patient, though he thought of the strange likeness more than once on his road homeward. \" Interesting case this, doctor,\" said Mr. Prestbury to his companion, after a very long silence, due more to the shortness of breath which precluded conversa tion while on horseback, than to the puffy practi tioner's natural taciturnity. \" Very \u2014 um\u2014 a\u2014 had the girl \u2014 um \u2014 a \u2014 under my"], [207, "MEDICINE NOT IN THE PHARMACOP\u0152IA. 199 hands \u2014 um \u2014 a \u2014 when at school \u2014 um \u2014 a \u2014 nice girl \u2014 very ! \u2014 um \u2014 a \u2014 must bring her round \u2014 um \u2014 a !

His mother had kept the knowledge from him, enjoining silence on Ph\u0153be, and this Avas the first satisfactory reason assigned for her absence. Satisfactory, inasmuch as it removed from his mind the haunting picture of Alice enthralled by the fascinations of a pre sent lover, forgetful of him lying stricken there; and the depth or severity of the burn he did not imagine. \"When was this? Is the burn severe?\" he Avhispered. \" Rather ; but the young lady is ill, independently, \u2014 lovesick Ave imagine, \u2014 fretting for some one or other, and we have to heal a heart as well as a hand.\" George looked wistfully into the face of the sur geon, as if wondering how far he might be trusted, and seeing only honesty there, said in a lower voice than his feebleness necessitated, \" If you can convey to Miss Ford a favourable account of my progress, Mr. Prestbury, you may serve us both \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 if you will tell her that her devotion has burnt into my heart deeper than the fire into her hand, you will make me your debtor for life !\" \" Or while the love-fit lasts,\" said the surgeon to himself; but he agreed to convey the message, and he kept his word."], [211, "203 MEDICINE NOT IN THE PHARMACOP\u0152IA. Thenceforward love-messages and tokens were sent by this most unpromising confidant, a tall, square shouldered, grave, middle-aged disciple of Esculapius, who had undertaken the task, because he believed in it as a curative agent, and not from any leaning towards secret embassage. And Mr. Ford, in his haughty isolation, unaware that the medical men attending his child came to her direct from the Lodge, neither knew nor suspected that the blunt Mr. Prestbury brought with him medicine more potent than that which Dick rode so many miles to obtain. A Avord, lightly dropped by Mr. HeyAvood prior to his departure, had prepared Michael to view Ph\u0153be's visits with suspicion, aud he watched her so closely that, but for their new ally, the parted lovers had been parted indeed. When Mr. Heywood was gone a shadow seemed lifted from the Grange, the inmates, as it were, breathed more freely, Michael's irritability sensibly decreased, and Alice brightened up wonderfully. Michael sat by her bedside, looking into her languid eyes, or counting the thin fingers of the unburned hand as it rested on his broad palm, but cautiously refrained from any allusion to Robert Heywood or his wishes on his behalf. His very harshness had arisen from his parental love. In his opinion Robert Heywood possessed"], [212, "204 god's PROVIDENCE HOUSE. every human excellence, and he felt he was but doing his duty in giving her to so worthy a man. He was imbued with a false notion that once married she Avould be sure to love him, and therefore had so little compunction in enforcing his will in opposition to hers. Now, however, when he felt the effects of his rashness, he blamed himself for precipitancy7, \u2014 only that, \u2014 and resolved to go to work less hastily in the future. Meanwhile George and Alice, both slowly, very slowly, gained strength ; weeks and months passing by before could use her hand or he his arm ; but in the early part of February George was re moved to his oavii chamber and Alice carried by her father daily to the drawing-room and placed on a sofa drawn to the fire, Avhile Margaret and Peggy followed closely with pillow7s, cushions, and rugs to prop her up and \" mak' her comfortable,\" as the latter said. Once or twice Mr. Heywood, urged as he intimated by his extreme anxiety and desire to see Alice, and assure himself of her improvement, rode over from Manchester for a day, seldom remaining more than a few hours, which he devoted to the sick girl Avith tender assiduity. She thanked him for his atten tion and for the many little delicacies which he lavished upon her, but his presence never cheered, and always depressed ; and he rode away each"], [213, "205 MEDICINE NOT IN THE PHARMACOP\u0152IA. time conscious that he was no nearer his aim (as far as she herself was concerned) than when he met her first at Ford brook. To Michael these flying visits, stolen from business hours, spoke of perseverance, constancy, and devo tion worthy a better reception than they met, and with the returning health of Alice, returned also much of his old manner Avith reference to his matri monial project for the two. \" Had the young lady received any great mental shock?\" was one of the first questions put to Mr. Ford by the doctors on their first visit, and the re membrance of the query, coupled with clear-sighted Mr. Prestbury 's reiterated injunction, that his patient's mind must be kept easy or he would not answer for the consequences, acted on Michael as a restraining influence ; and, so long as her pale face and languid frame reminded him of her debility, he abstained from pressing the offensive subject upon her. With the approach of spring all about and around the Grange sprang to life and activity, and its master Avas the lever setting all in motion, though neither he nor his hinds had been idle during the winter. There was work for Miles and work for Matthew ; but the latter was so constant a customer to Ralph Home that he neglected his business, and disappointed his patrons, more than Michael felt disposed to over-"], [214, "206 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. look. If he sent a horse to be shod, horse and man might wait an hour or more at the forge before the blacksmith could be persuaded to leave his ale for the anvil ; and frequently, even then, be was inca pable of performing his task, or did it in so rough and slovenly a fashion, that Michael threatened to send his work to Chester or set up a steady man in a neAV smithy. For a time this threat, coupled with complaints from other quarters, sobered him ; but the scorn of Ph\u0153be, and the sight of her companionship Avith his more favoured rival, drove him wild, and he fleAV to his old solace, the ale-can, even though it brought him into closer contact with the smiling face which had beguiled aud misled him. It is true Ph\u0153be spent much of her time at the Lodge ; but the Black Bear was her acknowledged home, and as she passed the smithy going or coming, or lingered at his busy neighbour's shed to exchange greetings, and make appointments, he followed the bright eyes with longing looks, his feet soon wandering in the same direction. From the Christmas night at the Grange, he had felt his pursuit hopeless ; the little beauty had often snubbed and scorned him, only to extend the hand of forgiveness Avhen her mood changed; but from that time her contempt had been withering; and AA'hen he saAV her, after John Tonks's defeat,"], [215, "MEDICINE NOT IN THE PHARMACOP\u0152IA. 207 enter her father's house on the arm of Miles, the first bloom of reciprocated love on both their faces, his heart sank, and his spirit and self-respect sank too. But Ph\u0153be, coquette as she was, could not settle down at once into a state of blissful content with the admiration of one lover only; so when the rough embraces of John Tonks began to fade from her memory, and the elation of her triumph at the declaration of Miles's long smothered feelings, had a little subsided, she began to worry herself about his still continued journeys to Chester ; and after a while questioned him as to his object. With a laugh and a kiss, and a promise that she should know some day, he put her off for the time ; but she returned to the charge, and finding him resolved to keep his secret, pouted, and turned from him with something of her old capricious manner. Then she thought he did not give her as much of his time as in duty bound ; and though the sensible fellow ex plained that the closer he stuck to his increasing business the better a home he should be able to provide for her, she was wilful and pettish, and protested he did not care for her half as much as Mat Spark, or some one else whom she could name. He had never been very jealous of Matthew, even when he had most cause, and noAv he only smiled at her reference to him ; but Ph\u0153be's frequent allusions"], [216, "GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. 208 to a mysterious \" some one,\" did cost him many a silent pang, and many a puzzling rumination as to whom the \" some one \" might be. But he loved her too dearly, and trusted her too well to trouble him self much about it : guessing (which was truly the case) that it was a pleasant fiction of her OAvn to enhance the value of her society ; and it was not until a dark hour came that he attached the name of any one to her vague \" some one.\" He had not much time to spare in the course of the working -week for courtship ; but every Sunday \u2014 after duly attending his venerable mother to and from church \u2014 he surrendered to Ph\u0153be with a readi ness and alacrity Avhich ought to have satisfied the spoiled damsel of his good faith, and warm heart. Madam Latham smiled graciously upon him on such occasions; and having ascertained from Ph\u0153be that she had discarded the blacksmith in disgust, and finally promised Miles to become his wife some day ; after a short homily on the virtue of constancy, the lady intimated her opinion that she had chosen wisely, remarked that Miles had changed for the better in the past feAv months, \u2014 was neither so coarse nor rude in speech, and argued that love, to have such a softening and civilizing influence, must be great indeed, and that if he continued to improve in the same proportion, Ph\u0153be instead of looking down"], [217, "MEDICINE NOT IN THE PHARMACOP\u0152IA. 209 upon him might be proud of such a husband. He was a good brother, and a good son, she concluded by saying, and she hoped Ph\u0153be Avas prepared to become as faithful and true a wife as so excellent a son deserved. To this the girl made no audible reply ; but looked down, examined the hem of her apron very minutely ; and, as she retired, muttered to herself, \" It will be time enough to prepare for that when I begin to prepare for the wedding.\" Nevertheless she was pleased with Madam La tham's encomiums of her lover, and approbation of her choice, and loved him not one Avhit the less because some one else thought him worth the loving. And Miles, as he worked away with a will to com plete the orders of Mr. Ford, and plied hammer or adze or saw with vigorous arms, sang at his Avork, and felt that every stroke was for Ph\u0153be, and brought their Avedding-day nearer. Along with the active farming operations, building Avas resumed, and progressed rapidly. More hands were needed on the neglected estate, and more homes to shelter them, and barns for harvests yet to be gathered, and shippons for extra stock ; and Mr. Peover, as soon as rheumatism permitted, came himself to inspect the work commenced under his old foreman's eye. VOL. II. p"], [218, "210 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Michael's cares -necessarily increased, but his energy was untiring; labour was as much enjoyment to him, as repose to an indolent man ; and but for his anxiety about Alice, and one other great draw back to his peace, he might have been pronounced a happy man. That other great drawback was his nocturnal visitor. During the early stage of Alice's illness, while her life was in a precarious state, it fortunately happened that the Grey Lady reposed in peace for two or three weeks, and Michael had hopes his enemy had forgotten him. Then she again made her appearance, even by Michael's bedside, but was gone ere he reached the cheese room. If he fired, he shot nothing \u2014 never found the bullets\u2014 and only alarmed the household, and startled his sick daughter \u2014 making her worse. Nor did the apparition come only at midnight, or confine itself to the corridor and cheese -room. It Avas met after nightfall by the affrighted domestics in all parts of the mansion, until the Avomen were afraid to stir about even in couples ; and the men huddled together in the kitchen after dusk. Dick, it is true, was an exception ; but then, it must be confessed, he had never encountered the spectral form, and would believe neither eyes nor ears in other people's heads. Generally these fearful visitations occurred one"], [219, "MEDICINE NOT IN THE PHARMACOP\u0152IA. 211 or two nights in succession ; then there was a lull, and for several Aveeks the Grange Avould be quiet and peaceful. But as no one knew when the appalling spectre, with its terrific scream, might rush into sight, and out again, like an electric flash, feverish excite ment held the household, and the servants protested their inability to remain under the same roof Avith so fearful a tenant. Michael's brow contracted after each fresh visita tion, and his firm lips set with sterner resolve ; but no study nor research of his could penetrate the mystery ; he could only watch and Avait, soothe his terrified wife, quiet his disturbed child, and storm at the \"folly\" of his domestics. These were only deterred from actual flight by the dread of incar ceration in gaol for breach of the hiring contract. Imprisonment Avas then far more terrible than residence in a haunted dwelling, Avith freedom of limb, and purity of food and atmosphere. There were no model prisons Avhere delinquents (especially the hypocritical) might be petted and pampered, and taught good trades without apprentice fees. The house of correction Avas a terror to all but chronic evil-doers, and even they dreaded its grim clutches ; so Michael held its rod in terrorem over his men and maids to restrain them from running away before the expiration of their several terms. P 2"], [220, "212 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. CHAPTER VIII. MR. PEOVER'S CONFESSION. Toavards the end of January Mr. Peover began to hobble about, supporting himself Avith a crutched stick, and shortly aster got out of doors, and resumed his business habits, as far as practicable. His fore man was reliable, had been with him many years, and understood his business in all its details : still, the old gentleman had a strong belief in the efficacy of a master's overlooking eye, and Avould never take a contract for work he could not personally superintend. Consequently the builder might ordinarily be met Avith in the course of a day in every quarter of the city, or the outlying districts, either trotting along on his sober brown cob, or hurrying with jerky steps from roAv to row, his restless eyes wandering from face to face, as though he feared a foe in every passing stranger."], [221, "MR. PEOVER'S CONFESSION. 213 Neither masons, nor bricklayers, nor carpenters, could tell when the jerky little man would appear amongst them, or Avhere his restless eyes would detect a flaw, as he scanned Avith a glance of quick observation and practical knowledge every Avail or joist, or rafter \u2014 now in the stone or timber yard, anon in the brickfield or the slate-wharf, at painters, or plumbers, or ironmongers, Avith masters or Avith men, so erratic in his movements, yet so sure to appear Avhen least expected, that labourers Avrought as though actually under his eye. And so he kept his men steadily at Avork, and careful to do that work well ; it being thoroughly understood that he dis missed loiterers without compunction, and showed as little toleration for loose or inferior workmanship. Yet he was by no means a severe taskmaster ; he paid better wages than any builder in the city, and if, as occurred at times, a workman happened to be injured by any casualty, or was ill from natural causes, invariably paid a weekly stipend to the suf ferer's family, until the man could return to his em ployment. At such times Mrs. Peover, or, on rare occasions, grave Margery, as her deputy, Avould visit their humble dwellings, to read and expound comfort ing Scripture to the sick, and carry, along with the comforting consolations of the Bible for the soul, con solation of a more material kind in a basket, for the"], [222, "214 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. body. On the whole, therefore, the eccentric old man was liked, and looked for, by the better part of his workpeople, Avho felt as if ever under the eye of a master Avho cared for them and their wellbeing, and they Avorked accordingly. They were wont to say of him \" Measter may keep the door of his house shut, but he never fastens the button of his pocket ;\" and so his return amongst them before Christmas favours were altogether forgotten, was everywhere hailed with very lusty shouts, as he popped his head over a half-raised wall, or in at an unsashed window, or cleared a way with his stick among a labyrinth of paint-cans and stencilling-pails. Amongst the contracts claiming his early regard Avas the Grange. Mr. Ford had been backward and forward several times, talking over matters connected with the extension of his premises, and the foreman had pushed the growth of brick and mortar very actively on, immediately after the disappearance of the frost, but Mr. Peover felt in duty bound to see that all was right and square. Besides, his two young friends were approaching convalescence, and he had an especial interest in both ; George as the son of his only7 old friend, and Alice as a charming girl, Avhose mother he had known Avhen she was a girl ; but old associations were not alone the source of his interest. He felt draAvn towards the pair as though"], [223, "MR. PEOVER'S CONFESSION. 215 they Avere a pair ; wherefore, he could not have told ; and so, Avhen Margery helped him to mount into the high gig (in which he had got the drenching Avhich brought on his rheumatism), by the side of his fore man, who was to drive, it was as much to visit the invalids, as the foundations of barns and cottages. As the Avheels rolled under the North Gate, the threats of his nephew rose to his mind, if they could be said ever to leave it, his trepidation became marked, and he glanced round him furtively, as if ex pecting at every step an arresting hand to be laid on the reins. As they passed from the shadows of Avails and houses he breathed more freely ; still, his anxious eyes wandered from bush to tree, in fearful dread lest gun or pistol lurked behind, charged with a mes senger of doom for him. As the fear grew upon him in the course of the drive, instead of talking to his foreman as was his wont, he sank into silence, pondering over Martha's often repeated advice, to confide in Mr. Ford ; and before they reached the Griffin gates, he had resolved (for the twentieth time) to get rid of his secret at any cost, \" if he had an opportunity ;\" always \" if he had an opportunity.\" Alice had that morning been removed into the draAving-room for the first time, and Mr. Peover's anxious inquiries about her were answered by usher-"], [224, "216 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. ing him into the room where she lay under a heap of warm (and stifling) coverlets on a sofa by the fire.

Raising her head from the cushions as Mr. Peover entered, Avith a pleased smile of recognition, she ex tended her lest hand to him ; for the right Avas not yet sufficiently healed to have borne the cordial grip given by the old man despite his rheumatism. \" So, young lady, of the three invalids, the old man is up and stirring first ! \u2014 up and stirring first ! \" said he, with a little attempt at jocularity, when first salutations Avere over. \" Ah, but you Avere ill and helpless first, remember, Mr. Peover,\" answered Alice faintly but pleasantly ; though a sigh followed her words, as thought rushed back to the third invalid, lying hurt and helpless on the snow. \" So I was \u2014 so I Avas !

But, young blood should stir quicker than old, and I hoped to have seen your pleasant face, and heard your blithe voice cheering our dull rooms long before this.

Together they visited the works in progress, and soon were deep in uninteresting mysteries of brick and mortar. The foreman Avas called to the council, and received his instructions afresh. Then Mr. Peover accompanied Mr. Ford across his newly ploughed fields, and listened to an account of diffi culties encountered in bringing the long-neglected and stubborn soil into subjection. \" I have a heavy task before me, much heavier than I contemplated when I came hither.

I never yet failed to accomplish that I set my mind on, and will not now.\" Michael paused, for he noted at length, what had escaped him before, that Mr. Peover's mind was abstracted, and his long tirade had fallen on deaf ears. He had been greatly annoyed by the visits of the Grey Lady during the week, and Mr. Hey wood, who had been at the Grange the preceding day, had not failed to strengthen the belief in Latham's complicity if the apparition was human ; hence this long declaration of Michael's aimed at. the Lathams through their friend the builder. But"], [229, "MR. PEOVER'S CONFESSION. 221 Mr. Peover was \" screAving his courage to the sticking point;\" and, occupied Avith his OAvn reflections, had lost the Avhole oration. \" Why, what's the matter, Mr. Peover ? \" said Michael. \" You seem beAvildered. I have been addressing you for some minutes, and do not think you heard one Avord.\" The builder, thus taken to task, stammered a sort of apology ; the gist of Avhich was, that he Avas debating how best to reveal a secret lying heavily on his mind, and so had not, through his OAvn pre occupation paid the attention he ought to have done. A secret lying heavily on his mind ! Surely he must knoAv something concerning their mysterious nightly visitant ! and, as tins thought flashed across Michael's mind, his brow lowered, and his lips tightened. Alas ! poor human nature.

Gladly would he have draAvn back, and waited a more promising opportunity, but Michael sat rigid and expectant opposite to him, and he knew it was too late to retreat. But as he marked the change from cordiality to coldness, his natural timidity returned ; he hesitated, shivered, looked around, fidgeted uneasily on his seat, and made two or three ineffectual attempts to commence his story, but nothing came of it. With much reserve arising from a growing belief that Mr. Peover's mind was burdened Avith the secret of the haunted rooms, Mr. Ford sat, and regarded him in silence until his not very large stock of patience was exhausted. Then finding the old man still irresolute, he opened the conversation. \" Well, Mr. Peover, you have something to reveal which it imports me to know. I am listening.\" The builder played nervously with the arms of his corner chair, as he looked up, and asked incre dulously \u2014 \" Imports you to know ? Did I say that \u2014 did I say that?\" \" I understood as much, sir, else Avhy make me the depository of your secrets?\" replied Michael, who began to think he might be mistaken after all. \"By Martha's desire, Mr. Ford \u2014 by Martha's desire. \u2014 I need advice \u2014 need sympathy, need for bearance.

There was so little sympathy in his face, that the timid man had small encouragement to proceed ; but he resumed, after a pause to collect his wandering thoughts, and Michael listened without more than an occasional interruption. \" I told you, when I saw you first, that I Avas once a working man, \u2014 a hard-working man.

He loved his dead sister's memory, and once had loved her son, and therefore every fresh evidence of his gudt struck him like a blow. Mr. Peover lost no time in acting on Mr. Ford's suggestion. The letter was written and signed, a duplicate preserved, together Avith the numbers of the notes enclosed and forwarded ; Mr. Ford witnessing the postage of the packet. It reached its destination safely, and was duly acknowledged in the 'Times.' From that day the old man's whole demeanour changed : the tremulous lip steadied, the restless eyes ceased to wander, his bending form grew more erect, and his movements were less jerky and irresolute. \u2014 Not all at once \u2014 not altogether. The habits of years VOL. II. R"], [250, "242 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. are not laid aside like old garments, they may wear away even to tatters, but the fragments remain till the shroud hides all. And so Mr. Peover, his dread of ignominy gone, his conscience unburdened, the habits which grew out of his fear gradually weakened and subsided, and in time his eccentricities were far less prominent. Still he kept aloof from strangers, and, following Mr. Ford's advice, avoided the Grange. Michael, however, felt a growing liking for the builder and his wife, so calm and dignified, yet so gracious and obliging, and became a frequent visitor at their house. After a time, Avhen Alice Avas con valescent, he drove her and Margaret over at times, to the great gratification of the good couple, Avho, having no children of their own to spoil, seemed inclined to lavish all their pent-up affections on the daughter of their new friend. On these occasions it would frequently happen that Mrs. Peover pressed Alice to remain and spend a few days under their roof; but her father invariably refused. He was too vigilant a guardian to throw her in the way of Mr. Peover's godson knowingly, therefore all her visits to God's Providence House Avere in his society ; and though he might leave her Avhilst he transacted business in the city, he was seldom absent long together, and always drove her"], [251, "TEMPUS FUGIT. 243 home Avith him. Alice felt his motive for refusing invitation so kindly given, but she made no sign of the growing rebellion in her breast ; and Michael, vigilant only when danger Avas apparent, and on the surface, mistook her silence for submission. But the visits did not commence until that month Avas out, and March had ceased its leonine roar, yet not subsided to the proverbial mildness of the lamb. Her rambles had been restricted to her father's grounds, and, on the ostensible plea that she Avas yet too Aveak to walk out alone, her mother or Peggy invariably bore her company by her father's com mand. Soon she resumed her attendance at church ; but father and mother both accompanied her thither, and guarded her home. Madam Latham still occu pied her pew alone; and as she met the Fords in the aisle at the conclusion of each service, curtsied formally, but with much dignity, in acknowledg ment of the haughty boAv of Mr. Ford, and the hesitating curtsey of his wife. To Alice she always extended her hand, which the y7oung girl took gladly. Together they walked down the aisle to the porch, and exchanged a few brief words of loving sympathy as they Avent ; and George Avas not forgotten. It was not the time, nor the place for altercation, and though Michael felt inclined to resent the lady's advance towards his daughter, there was that in R 2"], [252, "244 god's PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Madam Latham's manner and bearing which for bade ungentlemanlike intrusion. He was not a boor, and could not insult a lady. From the time Mr. Prestbury ceased to visit Alice, communication Avith George was suspended. Ph\u0153be was in Chester, making wedding garments for Miss Wright ; so the feAV brief words from his mother's lips fell like rain on parched soil. On the second of these Sunday meetings, Madam Latham named her son's anxiety to see Alice, but did not invite a visit against the father's will. The girl answered that she was almost a prisoner, Avatched on every hand, and could not escape for an hour. Next Sabbath a brief note, scrawled by George with his left hand, was passed to her, with an apology for conniving at secret correspondence. The excitement attending Mr. Latham's conversa tion with Mr. Peover had once more thrown him back, renewing febrile symptoms ; and Mr. Prestbury unable to account for a change so unexpected, sought a solution from his mother. She detailed the cir cumstances attending Mr. Peover's visit. The sur geon looked surprised, but made little comment that did not concern his patient. He said such relapses must be guarded against most carefully, all irritation or annoyance avoided : he would not answer for the consequences if his very excitable young friend were"], [253, "245 TEMPUS FUGIT. not kept calm and unruffled. Bearing this in mind, Madam Latham was greatly perplexed when George began to ask for Alice, to wonder she did not come, and torment himself with a thousand groundless fears and apprehensions. In her dilemma she consulted Mr. Prestbury ; he hesitated, deliberated, and after an experimental introduction of the subject lying nearest his patient's heart, came to the conclusion that it Avould be safer to permit an interview than allow George to wear himself out Avith brooding and chafing over his separation from his betrothed. So the invalid was permitted to write, and his mother undertook to deliver his billet, with an innate shrink ing from the task which nothing but maternal love would have overcome. It was not right for her, she thought, to lure the girl to disobey her sire, it Avas not right to sanction, still less invite a secret inter view Avhen that sire interdicted open communication ; but her last, her only son's life was at stake, and Mr. Ford's prejudices and her OAvn feminine scruples were cast into the shade. The note read, and kissed, and wept over, by Alice in the seclusion of her own chamber, was an earnest and impassioned reiteration of his longing desire to see her, urging his helplessness, and ap pealing to her love. Mr. Heywood had been at the Grange that Aveek,"], [254, "246 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. if possible, more devoted and attentive than ever. Whether walking1 or driving he was her sole com panioa Mrs. Ford was busy with her house, the yeoman with his farm. Gladly Avould Alice have resumed her home duties, but that Avas forbidden, and the doctor's mandate \" out-door exercise \" strictly enforced. If she plied her needle Robert Heywood produced a book and read to her, or entertained her ear with stories of life and manners in other lands. Differently situated, he would have been a welcome, agreeable, and perhaps dangerous associate, for his manner was seductive and fascinating, yet ever re spectful. Agreeably to her request he had ceased to call her Alice, and for that she was grateful. But his attentions were accepted under compulsion. She felt that he presumed on her father's open appro bation, and took her final assent for granted. He assumed as a matter of course a right of protectorate nothing in her conduct had warranted, and at Avhich her spirit revolted. He was in her presence calm and self-assured, and imperturbable, whether she was repellant or indifferent. The language of his glitter ing eyes was that of the rattlesnake to its victim, \" you are mine, there is no escape ;\" but, like the deadly serpent's note of Avarning, the old and un pleasant recollection connected Avith his face revived and strengthened Avithin her : and while the fire"], [255, "247 TEMPUS FUGIT. burned in her heart like a halo round the name of George Latham, the icy barrier between herself and Robert Heywood rose higher and higher, not to be thawed or surmounted. He was gone when the precious little note from George was put into her hand. Gone ! and there was one spy the less upon her actions. Months before, she had saddened George with her determina tion not to see him again Avithout her father's consent, but then she had contemplated passive opposition, not the active coercion she had felt so keenly. No peril then threatened her lover's life, she hoped to wear out or soften her father's prejudices : but now, in effect a prisoner, compelled to accept the unwel come addresses of a man she dreaded, unsoothed even by the sympathy of her mother, with no com panion but the little miniature, purchased by pain and suffering to both, no monitor to guide or counsel, alone with her own heart and the warm lines before her, no wonder she resolved once more to risk dis pleasure at home, and obey the dictates of her heart, which said she owed a duty to herself and George as well as to her father. Accordingly the following day, when Peggy would have pursued the beaten track, and kept\u00bbtheir feet within the boundary of the grounds, Alice, heedless of entreaty or importunity, went out at the Griffin"], [256, "248 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. gate, and crossed the road to the little wicket in the plantation fence. \" Oh, Miss Ailse, Miss Ailse, dunna yo go theer ! Yo munna go theer ! Measter 'ull go downreeght woild,\" exclaimed the faithful domestic, in bitter distress. \" I must, Peggy ! You can return if you do not choose to accompany me, and so clear yourself from blame. There is no necessity to provoke his dis pleasure by proclaiming that AA'hich he need not know. For my own actions I alone am answerable ; if you fear consequences to yourself, as I said before, you can return, I do not seek to involve you,\" replied Alice, with calm determination in voice and eye. \" Oh, Miss Ailse, it isna' that oim not afeard for moisel' ; Measter con but pay me my hauf year's wage, an turn me out, an' he wunna do that, I reckon ! but he'll be mortal angry wi' you ; dunna yogo!\" \" Peggy, my girl, fear nothing for me ; I am past fear. If Dick lay at his grandmother's with a broken leg or arm, recovering from long sickness, made worse by hearing you Avere going to marry another man, what should you do ? \" \" Whoi- go an' see un, an' tell un it wur a lee, to be sure ! But then th' gentry are not loike us common folks ! \""], [257, "TEMPUS FUGIT. 249 \" Gentry have human feelings, and I have mine ; what you would do, I am doing. You can go with me or return, as you think proper ! \" said Alice, as resolutely as before. \" Well, if you mun, oi' mun, but mak heaste, an' mayhap measter Avunna know,\" reluctantly assented Peggy, softened by the application of the case to herself and Dick. No need to bid Alice hasten ; love is proverbially fleet-footed, and Peggy found herself on the broad flag between the double flight of steps at the Lodge in less time than she had expected. George, propped by pilloAvs in a padded easy-chair, sat with his arm in a sling (the leg had been well some time) between the fireplace and a window commanding the approach to the house, so Alice found the door open, and Madam Latham ready to receive her. At Alice's suggestion Peggy was shown into another room, not into the hall amongst chatter ing servants. She was growing Avary, with all her fearlessness. Who shall venture to describe that meeting ? Sighs and tears, and kisses, mingled Avith congratu lations, regrets, hopes and fears, and explanations, and then followed plans and schemes for the future. He could not live without seeing or hearing from her, some mode of correspondence must be planned."], [258, "250 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Was there any communication betAveen the village and the Grange ? \" Very little ; and that confined to the servants and labourers,\" said Alice. \" Does not Mr. Gresham visit you ? \" \" Yes, occasionally. He came to see me in my illness, I believe, but I was scarcely conscious at the time.\" \" My poor dear Alice ! your devotion cost you dear. But is the servant who accompanies you \u2014 Peggy, I believe you call her \u2014 to be trusted ? \" \" Yes, but I should not like to tamper with my father's servants, George, she risks his anger in coming Avith me now.\" \" I have no scruples of the kind, my love, and will see what can be done before she leaves. Has she a sweetheart ? \" \"Yes; Dick!' \" I'll manage it then. Does not Miles Wood work for your father ? \" \" He has a waggon in hand now ; but I rarely see him.\" \" No matter ; I can depend on him. And now, Alice,\" said he, with a quickly varying face, \" tell me of this Mr. Heywood, Avho was your constant com panion last week. When do you expect his return ? and does he ever write to you ? \""], [259, "251 TEMPUS FUGIT. \" Never to me, dear George, I refused to receive his letters ; but to my father he does frequently ; and he generally comes unexpectedly.\" \" If he should offer to write again, do not object, and let me see his letters.\" \" But that would encourage him and be dishonour able into the bargain. I cannot do that.\" \" My darling ; I fear that he is dishonourable, if I am right, I can pluck the mask from his face, and earn your father's gratitude.\" \" Oh, George ! can that be true ? \" \" I think so ; come closer, love, and listen. With his uninjured arm he drew her towards him, and related how he had been attacked, and by whom. \" On the same night, Alice, Mr. Heywood visited the Grange, and about the same hour :\u2014 you see I have made enquiries, \u2014 Mr. Prestbury also tells me that there is a striking resemblance between the fellow who insulted you, and Mr. Heywood.\" Alice started. \" Has that occurred to you also ? \" \" I have been haunted by an unpleasant reminis cence of his features, and there certainly is a likeness of that horrid man, as far as I can recall. But, if I remember rightly, his face was white and expres sionless. Mr. Heywood's is just the reverse.\""], [260, "252 god's providence house. \"Is he so handsome then?\" asked George, -with the very slightest approach to annoyance. \" My father thinks him so ; and so might I, but for the peculiarity I have named, and his persecution.\" \" Dear Alice, a question or two more and I have done. What is the man's complexion? and what kind of teeth has he ? Describe him as well as you can.\" \" He wears a peruke ; but his eyebroAvs and eye lashes are almost as dark as yours ; his teeth are large and white, and he has a colour on his cheek like a woman.\" \" Strange ! \" murmured George, \" Ned's light hair and sickly skin made his face white and blank. And then the teeth ! Well, Alice, love,\" he con tinued, after a pause, \" the descriptions do not tally ; but I am not satisfied, and mean to be so.\" He then told her that, finding Ned Bostock with his uncle Jeffery, set him thinking of the letter found in the silk dress Mr. Heywood gave to Mrs. Ford ; and suggested a suspicion, heightened by Mr. Prest bury's observations. Then he announced his inten tion, as soon as he could bear the fatigue of a journey, to visit Manchester, and, with that letter by him, sift Mr. Heywood's pretensions to the bottom. \" I shall not rest, Alice,\" he concluded, \" until I have assured myself that he is, or is not the impostor I suspect.\""], [261, "TEMPUS FUGIT. 253 I*eggy was very loath to become a medium of com munication between the two ; but a couple of guineas in hand, and the promise of twenty more when she married, effected a change in her opinions, and she agreed to hand over to her young mistress all letters conveyed to her, whether by Miles or any one else. There Avas a sad parting : a few kind and com forting Avords from Madam Latham, and a hurried walk homewards, during which Peggy remarked her hand and feet had been itching all day, sure signs she would tread on strange ground, and handle money. Michael rebuked the woman sharply for suffering Alice to overwalk herself, but having full faith in Peggy's trustiness, had no further suspicion. In a Aveek or two another visit was hazarded, and this time George walked with Alice through the plantation on their return. Mr. Heywood had ar rived during their absence, and there was a bustle of welcome going on when she and Peggy entered the hall. For two or three days Alice was oppressed by his continual presence, which she Avas not per mitted to avoid, even by a retreat to her own room. Then he Avent, and the atmosphere around her seemed purer and freer. George Latham, with his arm in a sling, again made his appearance at church. A thankful tear hung on Alice's eyelash, and even Mr."], [262, "254 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Ford had the grace to congratulate him stiffly on his recovery. Ph\u0153be had returned to Shotwick, and by the aid of herself and Miles, a tolerably constant corre spondence was carried on betAveen the parted lovers, destined, however, to come to a sudden and un expected termination. The two guineas which had crossed Peggy's itching palm, pinned in a bit of rag, were not deposited in a bank (which might break), or in the huswife which held her yearly savings, but were again pinned in the bottom of those ample pockets women then wore, like panniers, on either side. They were a weight in her pocket, a weight on her mind, and her sleep was disturbed by visions of the twenty yet to come. For the first time in her life she was oppressed by that uncomfortable load, a secret. She had two golden guineas of which Dick knew nothing, and a fortune in perspective, of which he could not dream. Here was a burden for a strong woman's weak mind. Like the milkmaid in the fable, she counted the guineas as already her own, and went about her ordinary Avork with a lofty sense of her own import ance, very amusing to behold. Her pocket, now a perambulating post-office, as well as a local bank, became a constant source of care and disquietude, and her temper, hitherto unimpeachable, grew so"], [263, "255 TEMPUS FUGIT. capricious that Dick protested she \"wur growin' noigh as bad as Sally.\" At length, chafing at this frequent imputation, and to ease her mind of its grievous load of care, she took Dick into her confidence, nothing doubting that the sight of the gold in hand, and hope of the gold to come, Avould make him as firm an ally as herself. But Peggy miscalculated the strength of her golden arguments, and the strength of Dick's fidelity. After rating her in good round terms for taking a bribe to deceive the master whose bread she had eaten so many years, he left her with the following outpour ings of his sentiments : \u2014 \" Noa ! dunna thee think as how oi'm to be bowght ower to cheat measter, or see un cheated ! Moi feather worked for Measter Foord's feather, an' oi've bin wi' Measter Foord, boy an' mon, noigh thretty year come Martinmas.

Noa, oi'd let Ben an' t'other lads kick ma round th' yard loike a foot-baw first. Oi'm asheamed o' thee, Peggy ; oi really am ! \" In a great huff was Peggy, who saAv her twenty guineas melting in the crucible of Dick's integrity ;"], [264, "256 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HODSE. but neither temper nor tears could restrain her SAveet heart from seeking out Mr. Ford on the instant, and revealing Avhat he Avas pleased to designate \" their sheamful goin's on.\" This Avas a terrible blow to Alice ; not merely on account of the fiery shoAver of indignation poured down on her devoted head by her enraged father, but in the consequences it entailed. In the first ebulli tion of his rage, he threatened Peggy Avith summary dismissal ; but Dick, Avho had not foreseen that re sult, put in a word for the faithful servant, Avho had only erred in serving the child instead of the parent. So Peggy remained ; but under considerable restric tions, like a hen Avith its Avings clipped. To Alice and George the effect was quickly made apparent. The Griffin gate was kept locked night and day, a sonorous bell being hung there under cover to an nounce the arrival of the few visitors who found their way to the Grange. In the re*r of the premises there was, besides the steps leading down to the river, an entrance for carts and cattle in the eastern wall, and this being some what nearer to ShotAvick than the circuitous road to the grand gate, Avas for many reasons that which gave access and egress to the villagers or farm ser vants Avorking for Mr. Ford. This led by a well-used roadway to a huge gateAvay (from which the gates"], [265, "257 TEMPUS FUGIT. had long been gone), through which huntsmen and hounds had used to rush pell-mell into the courtyard to the house or kennels. The large gate in the boundary wall was now kept closed by Michael's peremptory orders, a boy being stationed there during working hours to open and close it when necessary. And so time wore away, bringing little change to Alice, now through long months a prisoner indeed ; restricted within the limits of her father's domain, and only allowed to pass the barriers under the guar dianship of himself or Mr. Heywood. She was supplied Avith such books as her jailer thought desirable, was at liberty to purchase materials for her embroidery or tambour frame whenever Michael himself had business in Chester, and was no longer debarred from the resumption of her housewifely cares and duties. Not compelled, therefore, by want of occupation to brood over her sorrows and position, she did not resign herself to moping melancholy, but set herself resolutely to face the future, whatever it might bring ; resolved to obey her father in all that did not involve a sacrifice of principle or love ; but equally determined neither craft nor compulsion should cause her to break her troth-plight to George Latham. He, poor fellow, with less patience and more im- VOL. II. s"], [266, "258 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. pulse, felt the separation most keenly. He had Avorn his patience out in the two years he had waited for the school-girl to ripen to Avomanhood ; scarcely a shred was left: he chafed, and fumed, paced the plantation-path, traversed Shotwick lane, watched the Griffin gate, and harassed Tom at all hours to drive him to Chester, in the vague hope of meeting his much-loved Alice at Mr. Peover's or on the road. Once or twice he was blest with a glance and a smile as their vehicles passed, and honoured Avith a scowl from her charioteer (on each occasion her father) ; but the smile was all he sought, and the scowl he never saw. Once he bribed Margery to take charge of a letter for his love, and watch an opportunity to deliver it ; having in vain tried to coax Mr. Peover or his wife to convey one. \" No, no, my boy ! I'll never again do wrong that good may come ! I did once, and it brought years of repentance \u2014 years of 1 epentance ! You must learn to bear your cross Avith patience \u2014 bear your cross with patience,\" objected the old man, sturdily ; whilst Martha, less abrupt, but equally impenetrable, said quietly but steadily, \" I do not think it would be right, George, for us, at our age, to play the part of emissary between you aud Miss Ford. She is intrusted to our charge by her father, who is strongly opposed to any intercourse between you ; and it would be a positive breach of"], [267, "TEMPUS FUGIT. 259 trust for us to promote a correspondence we know him to have forbidden. We are truly sorry for Mr. Ford's unjust prejudices, and would remove them if Ave could ; but I cannot break faith Avith him. You must wait in patient faith the will of God, and all Avill come right in the end, never fear. There is an all-wise Providence watching over us; pray resign yourself into his hands.\" George acquiesced in her consolatory words, with a sigh which told how little consolation they afforded him, and turned away deploring the unhappy fate attached to his name. Mental excitement is known to be of all things most prejudicial to the cure of severe wounds, con- sequently George's shoulder healed and broke open more than once during this period ; and not until Mr. Prestbury assured him perfect repose of mind Avas more necessary than repose of body, to fit him to hold a rein or accomplish the fixed purpose of his mind, did he boAv quiescently to the dictates of pru- dence and reason. And even then he rushed out into the rain one night in April, forgetful of himself in his thought for a tenant, and added severe cold to his other ills. He enlisted the Rev. Mr. Gresham in his service ; but Michael, grown suspicious of all visitors Avith acknoAvledged predilections for the Lathams, received * s2"], [268, "260 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. the reverend gentleman's occasional visits with dis trust; and carefully guarded against any private conversation with his daughter, although he was sufficiently cordial and hospitable to prevent any conception of personal ill-feeling or unfriendliness. His antipathy to George Latham greAV and strengthened with every fresh attempt at a clan destine correspondence, but Michael was not so blind or unjust as to harbour enmity against his agents, though they fell under immediate displeasure ; he regarded them but as plastic tools in the hands of an unscrupulous diplomatist, and after the first hasty flash of anger forgave readily. But Mr. Ford had altered very much during the few months spent in the Grange ; he was always doggedly obstinate, and somewhat hasty ; but he had grown irritable and suspicious both, to the last degree. Even placid and yielding Margaret found him diffi cult to please at all times. Alice, with her quiet front, opposing to him a will inflexible as his own ; George Latham's persistent efforts to set his will and authority at naught ; and lastly the impenetrable mystery which surrounded his haunted mansion, baffled, perplexed, and irritated him. Sleepless nights folloAving anxious and laborious days did not tend to improve either his health or temper; and the frequent and uncertain visits of the luminous"], [269, "TEMPUS FUGIT. 261 Grey Lady, Avho had begun to appear at all hours, and in all parts of the premises, not unfrequently by his own bedside, drove sleep from his anxious pillow. He began to look haggard and careworn, and the efforts to disguise his secret anxiety, to con ceal his rising doubts as to the verity of the ghost, and the frequency of its nocturnal appearance, con tributed not a little to the marked change alike in his inner and outer man. Still, he worked aAvay at his alterations and improvements, increased his stock, and engaged fresh labour as soon as Mr. Peover, by his deputy, Mr. Morgan, had provided \" good ac commodation fur man and beast ; \" and none ob serving his unflagging energy, his persistent course, would have dreamed how often a still small voice rose in his breast whispering, \" Abandon the Grange, it is doomed ! \""], [270, "262 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. CHAPTER X. THE WHEELWRIGHT'S SHED. Hearts beat with like emotions whether in hall or cottage, and Time in his flight flaps his strong wings as remorselessly against the rustic gable as the lofty turret, as Miles and Ph\u0153be found to their sorroAV. Their wedding-day had been fixed, and the banns proclaimed, Avhen an unforeseen calamity broke into all their pleasant plans. It has been shown that Miles Wood had a flourish ing trade ; his industry, probity, and punctuality gave additional value to his skill, and, as a natural con sequence, he was employed, not only by neighbouring farmers, but the surrounding gentry also, who did not care to send to Chester for that which could be done as well and as cheaply nearer home. So work came in plentifully, and the wheelwright's savings gradually increased. With the improvement in his business,"], [271, "THE WHEELWRIGHT'S SHED. 263 an improvement in his person and manners became apparent ; certainly not the result of extra work or a deepening pocket. There were not a few in the village traced this gradual change back to the date of his weekly visits to the city ; and argued that he had \" talked wi' city folks till he Avur for settin' oop fur a gentlemon himsel.\" If that AA7ere so, then manner and conversation must be catching, like the measles or the croup, for certainly Miles began to display marked symptoms of civilization. Some peculiar affection of the throat and vocal organs had subdued and refined his voice; imparting to his speech common graces certainly not known to his mother-tongue. His gait, never clownish, was now as easy in the presence of his superiors as it had been amongst his equals, and he held his head erect as though he were conscious of that within himself which lifted him mentally above his fellows. He was rarely seen in the bar of the Black Bear, though it was Ph\u0153be's home, and there were not wanting envious people to sneer at Miles as too proud to take a pot of ale iu a friendly Avay, and insinuate to Ralph that he \" wur too sober a chap for a son-in-law.\" But Ralph had seen enough of drinking in his time, and felt his daughter fitted for something better than the hostess of the Black Bear, so his usual reply Avas, \"Oi neither meddle"], [272, "264 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. nor make, moi lass mun please hersen whoAv she weds ; she'll have to live Avi' un, not oi. An if she ha' taken up Avi' a steady, thrifty lad. so much th' better. An if he be proud, hisn be proid o' th' roight soort, oi reckon.\" Nor were there wanting feminine gossips to whisper in Ph\u0153be's ready ear that the afternoons and evenings spent by her sweetheart in Chester were given to a rival, else why did he don his Sunday suit, and grease his shoes before starting ; and it was very plain he did not go for any good, or he would not be so shy of people knowing. And silly little Ph\u0153be allowing herself to be dis turbed by these curious and meddling Avomen, put on strange airs, and passed his shed Avith head tossed aloft, and her nose turned up in ineffable scom, not deigning to look at the perfidious man who \" thought to make a fool of her, but Avould find himself mistaken.\" At first these fits of jealousy exhausted themselves in a day or two ; but as she began to think he was not sufficiently impressed by7 these displays of displeasure, she also began to feel slighted because his evenings Avere more generally spent at home than with her. A light might be seen burning through his lattice when all other candles in the village were extinguished, and the lark did not leave her couch before Mdes Wood"], [273, "THE \\\\ HEELAVRIGHT'S SHED. 265 was up and at Avork. The reason for this was a mystery Ph\u0153be longed to solve ; and, not being able to do so to her satisfaction, she quarrelled with him in downright earnest, and for three whole weeks kept aloof from him, and turned up a scornful nose when he attempted to approach her. At length a letter, written in a stiff fair hand, but neatly Avorded enough, found its way to the pettish damsel, just as she began to feel her ill-humour very irksome and uncomfortable to herself, since she obtained little sympathy in her wayward moods from any one she felt Avorthy her confidence. A letter, in a good bold hand, and signed Miles Wood ! What could it mean ? He could not write, she knew, she hoped he had not asked the clerk to write for him, exposing their affairs to strangers ! And so she turned the letter over and over, from side to side, Avondering who had Avritten it, and Avhy it was written, for some moments before she consulted the document itself for its own solution. Once read, in a flutter of delight and surprise, she sought Madam Latham, and put the letter into her good friend's hand without a Avord. The lady looked from the letter to the flushed face and tearful eyes of the young girl, and taking it to the light, read it carefully through. It was a letter worthy of Miles. It told in plain,"], [274, "266 god's providence house. but earnest words, Iioav he had loved Ph\u0153be for many years, and how on her return home \"for good,\" he had felt his inferiority as he had neA7er felt it before. He saw neighbouring farmers' sons glance at her in church, and was stung with the thought that they were more her match than he was. He felt that a man who could not write his name, or read a chapter in his Bible without spelling the hard Avords, was sure to be despised by a lass who had been to school, and taught like a lady. From that moment he had resolved to surmount that obstacle between them, and prevailed on the clerk to give him lessons in secret, and the curate becoming aware of this had also kindly lent him a helping hand. Then commenced his journeys to Chester, not for courtship, but schooling ; and, as he grew more ashamed of his deficiency, the more he saw what learning meant, and what difficulties lay in his path, he became more reluctant to let his secret studies become known. Spurred on by his unspoken love, he had given every moment he could spare, or snatch from sleep, to self-improvement, to fit himself to mate with her. But when, after some months' application, of Avhich she knew nothing, he had found Ph\u0153be willing to take him as he was, his resolution gave way, and he was nigh telling her his secret. And often afterwards, when"], [275, "THE WHEELWRIGHT'S SHED. 267 she cast up to him that he Avent flirting Avith some one else, he had hard Avork to hold his tongue. But he did, and only worked harder, because she had promised to be his ; and he would not give his Avife a chance to look down on him. Now, he saw that she really suspected him of Avrong motives in going to Chester, and spending so much time away from her, he thought it was right to con vince her of his constancy, and let her know what he had been doing and why. She would not give him a chance to speak, so he sent that letter _at once to speak for him, and prove his words. He could now write and cipher and spell, and hoped in time to be a better scholar still. \" Ph\u0153be,\" said Madam Latham, when she folded up the letter, \" you need to be proud of that man, and his honest love. He has fought a battle for you better than a brawling fight in a public-house, or by the roadside ; he has fought against the temptation of his own heart, and against ignorance. He is worthy to be esteemed, loved, and cherished. He is worthy a sensible and thoughtful wife, who will not check his progress, or hurt his feelings, by Avayward caprices, or fitful vagaries. Go to him now, my child, and con fess candidly, that though he was in the wrong not to confide in you earlier, that you were still more to blame for doubting him !\""], [276, "268 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Ph\u0153be had some sterling qualities in her breast. She went, owned her aptness to listen to rumour, rather than reason, and there was a reconciliation so perfect and harmonious, that before they parted the Avedding-day was talked of. Before the week was out Ralph's consent Avas formally asked and obtained, and the important day fixed. Jane begged a week's leave of absence, and came to trim up the cottage and jDrepare it for a new mistress. The banns were put up, and Ph\u0153be was from morning until night in a flutter of excitement and a tangle of thread and silk, linen and linsey. Madam Latham ordered out the lumbering chariot (so well kept and so seldom used), and went into the city to purchase a wedding-dress, a tea-service, and a \"Family Bible\" for the bride. Ralph himself went about smiling and important, and all was bustle and rejoicing. Miles, though elated, Avore an air of thoughtful gravity, Avhich at times rather piqued Miss Ph\u0153be, who could not see that a Avedding was so very serious a matter. But Miles did, not the less that she did not. His mother had been mistress of his house ever since it had ceased to be her own ; and her comfort Avas paramount in his mind. Would Ph\u0153be, light and fluttering as she was, Avear her matronly honours unobtrusively without entirely displacing the old dame ? Would she sit down by his fireside content"], [277, "THE AVHEELWRIGHT'S SHED. 269 Avith his sober love, nor sigh for the admiration she had been fed upon so long; would she indeed be a help meet for him, and assist in his advancement in life and in society? His views were widening, and the village narrowed, as education expanded his ideas : would she share those views? He hoped she would, but only hoped ! Marriage was a serious matter to him. The banns had been read once, twice, thrice ; Alice present on one of these occasions, had congratulated Ph\u0153be on the coming event, and sent by Dick a present of napery spun by her own hands, accom panied by a huge jar of jam, and a pair of shepherd and shepherdess china chimney ornaments from Mrs. Ford, and a ponderous cheese from Michael, who Avas desirous to prove on this occasion that he owed the young couple no personal ill-Avill, though he did keep them at a respectful distance from his daughter. The Sunday following the third reading of the banns, was fixed for the wedding. On the previous Monday, Miles, as usual, went to Chester, but not on his ordinary errand ; the ring had to be bought, and his wedding suit (not trusted to the village tailor) had to be brought home ; a Avedding-cake and other dainties not procurable in Shotwick, had to be pur chased, and instructions left with the carrier to bring them on the Wednesday. Then he had to see Jane's"], [278, "270 god's PROVIDENCE house. mistress, and arrange for her to come over for the day and act as bridesmaid. All this important business he had transacted to his satisfaction, though it occupied more of his time than he had anticipated, and when he started home wards it was after seven o'clock. He walked on, however, with a quick light step, for an April shower was falling briskly. As he passed the milestones one by one on his returning path, a restless anxiety to reach home came over him, and he quickened his pace, feeling at the same time as if his feet were shod with lead, and he could not move them fast enough. As he turned from the Parkgate road into the village lane a bright glare above and among the trees at tracted his attention. What was that ! surely not fire ? Yes, fire ! The flames leapt high above the budding branches, and the shower of fiery sparks spurted upwards into the reddened sky, mocked the falling shower of rain, and defied its drops to do their most to quench it. For an instant, Miles stood aghast; a fear of he knew not what, possessed him, and he ran as for his life. Before he turned into the street, he knew, he felt, on whose hearth that fire was kindled, Avhose hopes fed those flames ! Yes, there, amidst a stifling cloud of wood-smoke, with the blue and yellow flames, writhing and twisting into every crevice, eating like"], [279, "THE AVHEELAVRIGHT'S SHED. 271 red-hot teeth into every joist or plank, or shelf or bench, then rushing in triumphant red masses through the breaking roof with a roar of triumph \u2014 there the Avheel Wright's shed was burning- to the ground. To whom he threAV the worthless Avedding suit he knew not then. Half frantic he rushed amongst the shouting and zealous crowd, who made way for him at once, and added his efforts to theirs. Michael Ford and George Latham (despite his wounded shoulder) had arrived before him, and with their servants battled with the vicious element. Mr. Gre sham, too, was there, and laboured Avith equal good will ; for all loved Miles, and besides, Avho knew where the conflagration might end ? The first cry of Miles Avas for his mother, seeing that his cottage was in danger ; but she had been removed to Ralph Home's, and was safe. Heads were there as well as hands ; men Avith ladders and buckets mounted the roof and poured water down in quick dashes, as it Avas handed to them from men below ; women worked like men at the pumps or Avells, went to the nearest springs with pitchers or cans, or hurriedly dismantled the newly trimmed house of its chief moveables. There Avas no hope of saving the old shed or a tool within it. The wood he used was dry and seasoned \u2014 ripened as it were for fuel ; the paint he kept for carts or ploughs"], [280, "272 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. was so much unction to the fiery sacrifice, and once alight, not all the buckets in the village could supply water to arrest the flames. Fortunately the wooden shed was apart from the cottage, though near it, and still more fortunately, not only for Miles, but the Avhole village, Mr. Latham, acting on his prudent mother's suggestion, had only the previous summer removed the whole of the thatched roofs, and replaced them Avith pantiles, and on these the sparks fell innocuously. But the heat and the greedy flames, leaping and darting, pressed their hot lips against the cottage gable, and with their fiery kisses melted the lead from the lattices, and breathed fiercely into the neat rooms. Willing hands and active feet were there, and the practical mind of Michael Ford to direct them, or the house had followed the shed. For a considerable time, during which Miles worked bke a young giant, their efforts to preserve his house seemed unavailing, but as the glare attracted country stragglers from distant farms, and the new comers joined the crowd, the fresh hands took the place of the weary, the battle with the elements continued, and gradually the water gained on the fire. Miles and Mr. Gresham had gone dauntlessly into the burning rooms, dashing about pails of water supplied by Ben and Tom, Avho took them at the door from other hands. The"], [281, "THE WHEELWRIGHT'S SHED. 273 smoke and steam drove the pair back only to return with fresh supplies of the cold fluid, and dash it against the heated walls and blazing AvindoAV-frames. On the hot roof, Dick and Ben, amidst a shower of sparks, from other buckets brought by strong men up ladders reared against the cottage front and back, poured down repeated streams upon the outer walls, nearest the shed ; on that, other men, under the supervision of George Latham, were employed with hatchets, flails, or pokers, beating down the wooden edifice, which crashed beneath their strokes, each falling plank feeding the central fire, which glared upon the faces of the men with an unearthly glow ; but, as the incandescent walls crashed into a heap, the leaping flames sprang up and clasped them in a last embrace. Nor was water spared, and soon after the last plank of the shed fell, the whole was reduced to a smouldering mass of red embers, whence a lambent flame darted here and there, telling of the unconquered foe beneath. But with the lowering flames, the danger of the cottage was reduced ; efforts, hitherto insufficient to restrain the advance of the fire, sufficed to drive it back, and keep it down. And as though the clouds wept in sympathy with the young wheelwright, the rain suddenly poured down in torrents, hissing and sputtering on the hot tiles and bricks, or on the charred wood, aiding the im- VOL.

Ralph Home had not been idle the while ; attended by his shock headed ostler, bearing a huge pitcher, he had dis pensed ale to the heated and Avorking croAvd Avith a liberality which did him credit, and spoke for his entire sympathy Avith his intended son-in-law. Michael Ford had been the guiding spirit of the mass, had organized the action, and directed every movement ; now here, now there, his lofty frame might be seen, ever prompt, ever ready, with eye, or hand, or voice ; to his energetic manner and con trolling will, Miles was principally indebted for the preservation of his home. Each and all seemed to obey his orders cheerfully and naturally7, without questioning his right to command, or theirs to execute. His clear eye, from the first, had observed George Latham's zeal and earnestness, though his disabled arm prevented active exertion ; and Avhen the fire Avas subdued, Mr. Ford came forward, and took the young gentleman's left hand kindly \u2014 he had not then heard of the meetings and correspondence between his daughter and George. \" I am pleased to see you here, Mr. Latham, and sorry ; this is neither time nor place for an invalid ; and the rain will certainly do you an injury. Do not think my interference ill timed, when I suggest that you are not only risking"], [283, "THE WHEELWRIGHT'S SHED. 275 your life, but causing Madam Latham much natural anxiety on your account.\" George thanked him for the hint, Avhich he folloAved ; auguring well for himself from Michael's kindly words. But he little knew the man. Michael could pay a generous tribute to any generous deed, Avithout a further deviation from his beaten path. Gradually the crowd dispersed ; some to the Black Bear, others to their scattered homes. Michael and Mr. Gresham were among the last to depart, and they remained behind endeavouring to rouse the unfortu nate young Avheelwright from the stupor into which he had fallen. As the last spark died out, he leaned against the hot and blackened gable of his house, and folding his arms surveyed the ruins of his Avorkshop in blank despair. There lay, a shapeless mass of ashes and charred wood, not merely a storehouse for tools, materials, and half-finished work, not merely his stock 'of such appliances, not merely the fountain head of his prosperity, but his wedding-day, and all the happiness he had based upon that day. He did not think, he did not reason, a sense of desolation overwhelmed him, and shut out all but the embers before him and the hopes smouldering beneath. It was in vain the gentlemen strove to console him with the assurance that the loss was not irreparable ; that Mr. Gresham advised him to boAV to the will of T 2"], [284, "276 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. Providence, or said that \" all seeming afflictions were but for ultimate good ;\" in vain that Michael offered to advance a sum of money to re-establish his busi ness ; the shock was too new, the light in his heart had been too rudely extinguished, to be rekindled all at once. \" Oi thank you kindly, gentlemen,\" said Miles (he bad not yet dropped the broad sound of the mono syllable, so difficult to overcome). \" Oi thank you kindly, you mean well oi know. But my father Avorked in that shed afore oi was born, and \u2014 and \u2014 I was to have been married on Sunday ; \u2014 that is all OA'er noAv. You're very kind, Mr. Ford, very kind, and oi am not ungrateful ; but you cannot put matters on the same footing they were an hour ago.\" He was reminded that his aged mother and Ph\u0153be would both suffer during his absence, more on his account than their own ; and the right chord being struck, accompanied by his good friends, he walked doAvn the village to the Black Bear, Dick being left by his master in charge of the dismantled house, lest the apertures where windows had been should tempt pilferers to make bad worse. As the three neared the inn there was a loud and confused noise of altercation, Mat Spark's thick voice above the rest exclaiming in vehement expostulative assertion, \" Oi tell ye oi didn't ! oi knoAv nought"], [285, "THE WHEELWRIGHT'S SHED. 277 about it ! An' the pleace bin brunt down, whatns that to mea? Oi've had nought to do wi' th' bran ning !\" '6 \" Hanna yo ! then Avea shouldn loike ta knaw Avhow hasn !\" exclaimed a chorus of voices, feminine as well as masculine, \" whow set guzzlin' in th' chimbley neuk when hisn neebour's house was a foire? Whow didna stir a peg, or gi'e a helpin' hond ?

Then there was a confused blending of vitupera tive epithets, and amidst which, \"leeing,\" \"drunken sot,\" \" lazy vagabond,\" \"jealousy,\" Avere alone dis tinguishable ; then came sounds of scuffling, of dull blows, and women's screams, and then a huddled mass tumbled out of the house together, with Mat thew in the midst striking out right and left with his fists, from which the old sledge-hammer force Avas rapidly vanishing. Miles and the two gentlemen moved aside from the steps, to let the excited crowd pass, lest they should be borne down by the rush ; but once in the"], [286, "278 god's providence house. street, Mr. Ford and the mild curate interposed between Matthew and his excited assailants, women and men alike pursuing the drunken smith with hard words or harder kicks and blows. But for that timely interference, the besotted man Avould scarcely have reached home with a whole skin or un broken bones, so convinced was the croAvd that he, and he alone, was the cause of that night's conflagra tion. As it was, a black eye, a bleeding nose, and bruised shins testified to the strength both of argu ment and opinion displayed on this occasion against Matthew. Shaking hands with Miles Wood and with each other, the friends separated at the door of the inn, rejecting Ralph's invitation to enter, neither caring to intrude on the privacy of the lovers, or the mother and son, then meeting for the first time after his calamity. Mr. Gresham bent his slow steps to wards his lodgings near the church gates, medi tating on the instability of fortune, the uncertainties of this life, the mysterious ways of Providence, and the necessity for faith and hope. Michael, too, trod the road to the Grange, now slushy with the recent rain, less quickly than his wont. He was sorry for the young man whose property was destroyed, and at a time which made the loss seem doubly severe ; and as he went on, Avith his head bent down and his"], [287, "THE AVHEELAVRIGHT'S SHED. 279 hands behind him, he pondered how he could best help the worthy mechanic to repair his loss with the least possible delay. Aster that he mused on the cause of the conflagration, Miles having protested all Avas safe when he closed the shed at noon ; a protest to which common sense assented, since it was clear fire would not smoulder among combustibles so many hours ere it broke forth. It was, therefore, as clearly the work of an incendiary ; surely the villagers could not be right in suspecting the blacksmith ! Yet who but he could have a motive to injure Miles ? It was well known that Matthew had taken to drinking as an antidote to disappointed love, well known that he made no secret of his jealous feelings and rising ani mosity ; for as in his drunken mood he became first maudlin and lachrymose, beAvailing his unfortunate fate, then passed to the irritable and quarrelsome stage, venting his spleen in curses and imprecations on his successful rival, Michael, as well as his rustic neighbours, had had frequent opportunities to hear his bitter invectives. Still Mr. Ford was unwilling to think the smith capable of fostering revenge in his heart. Hot headed he knew him to be, but when sober (which was then seldom the case) he was open-hearted and straightforward. Suspicion, however, pointed to him Avith a very rigid finger, and Michael began"], [288, "280 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. to fear lest the morning enquiry should confirm sus picion and render it imperative to bring the offender to justice. From the fire and its contingencies his thoughts Avandered to the invalid Avith his arm in a sling, Avhose Avhite face, animated by generous im pulse, irradiated by the fiery gloAv, had impressed him more favourably than he had thought possible. Prejudice hinted that he Avas the wheelwright's land lord, and probably uninsured ; but Michael's native honesty compelled him to abandon this suspicion as un just, and give the young gentleman full credit for the good impulses which drew him from his home through the night air and the fill ling rain, Avith a Avound yet un healed and a frame shaken by long illness. \" It's a thou sand pities that young fellow's a Latham,\" murmured he, as he took a pass-key from his breeches-pocket and unlocked the Griffin gate. \" A thousand pities ! If he and our Ailsie had not fancied they Avere in love with each other Ave might have been good neigh bours. Never mind, those foolish fancies die out in time, as I knoAv well, and Avhen Ailsie and Robert are married and aAvay, and he has forgotten her, and Avedded some one else, we may be good neighbours yet.\" There Avas a touch of compunction toAvards George in these mutterings, not to last long, hoAvever, for Dick's officious zeal for his master rendered that master more prejudiced and inveterate than before."], [289, "THE AVHEELWRIGHT'S SHED. 281 In Ph\u0153be's room at the Black Bear, a sorrowful trio Avere assembled, mother and son and the bride expectant of an hour before. The round snap table was heaped with wedding finery in various stages of preparation ; the cumbrous chintz-covered sofa was similarly filled ; on a chair were the tAvo neAV straw plait hats made by Jane Wood for herself and future sister to wear at the wedding : these were partially trimmed, and the white ribbons carelessly thrown down, trailed unheeded on the floor already strewed Avith shreds and clippings, pins and ends of thread or silk. At the first cry of fire Ph\u0153be had rushed to the spot without hat or cloak, wringing her hands and shrieking in her fright and agony. Finding that the shed only was then on fire, Avith more promptness than might have been expected from her, she darted into the cottage to remove its aged occupant. The old dame was still up and dressed, waiting her son's return, alarmed at the noise and glare, yet unaware of its cause. Hurriedly Ph\u0153be invested her with cloak and hood, and trembling with her OAvn fears, led the tottering steps of the feeble woman from the exciting scene and probable danger, before the fire had touched the gable of the house. Placing the old Avoman carefully in an easy-chair, with a hasty kiss for solace and sympathy, the girl ran back, anxious to know the worst, and eager to save from destruction"], [290, "282 god's providence house. whatever moveables were threatened by the spreading flames. What she lacked in strength, she supplied by her active feet and nimble fingers, whilst other women, stronger bodied, carried away baskets and boxes as she filled them. But the fire spread so rapidly, and the heat was so great, they were driven from the rooms nearest the shed, then from the staircase, which ran straight up from a short passage at the front door, and divided the house into two equal parts. No longer useful, she continued to run backwards and forwards from the house of her father, to that she had begun to regard as her own, too excited to remain inactive by Dame Wood's side, too truly sympathizing Avith the widow, whose old home was burning, to leave her alone in her trouble and sus pense long together ; and thus she continued to rush Avildly to and fro, until the shed collapsed and the flames subsided. Then, and not before, Ph\u0153be returned to her work-room, and throwing herself on the sofa, regardless of its contents, hid her face in her apron, and cried bitterly. Having overcome the tremor occasioned by the sudden fright, Dame Wood sat looking in silence at the red cinders in the grate, more afflicted for her dutiful son than for herself. Tears chased each other slowly doAvn her wrinkled cheeks, and dropped on the freckled thin hands in her lap, but she uttered"], [291, "THE AVHEELA\\tRIGHT'S SHED. 283 no audible lament. She was trying to reduce her rebellious spirit to submission to the Divine will ; but Christian as she was, and standing on the brink of the grave, she did not overcome without a struggle. But when the sobs of Ph\u0153be reached her ears, she strove to comfort the weeping girl with such scraps of homely or Scriptural comfort as her memory was charged with, and as may be supposed all in vain, for she could not dive to the depths of Ph\u0153be's soitoav. If her home was burned down \u2014 and she did not know that it was not ; if her only refuge henceforth must be an almshouse, or the poorhouse \u2014 and she did not know that it Avould not ; if her son Avas reduced from- prosperity to beggary \u2014 and she did not know that he was not ; if her son must resign his modest hopes, and Avork for another Avhere he had worked for himself\u2014 and she did not knoAv that he need not ; if her son's marriage floated away into the dim distance of the future, and she could reach the source of his affliction, and feel for him, she could not penetrate the arcana of Ph\u0153be's grief. No \u2014 not all that litter of Avedding finery displayed before her aged eyes, could reveal the misery of a vain and pretty coquette past her twentieth birthday, at the prospect of a deferred wedding. She did not calculate how many eyes Ph\u0153be had thought to dazzle \u2014 hoAv many hearts, feminine and masculine,"], [292, "284 god's providence house. she had thought to break Avith envy7 and disappoint ment. She had not felt the flutter of the little heart as each becoming garment had been tried and ap proved, nor seen the rising flush as the maiden had looked in her glass and pronounced herself beAvitch ing. She had not thought of the ambition to be her own mistress, and a married woman, before her com- panions, carrying off the best looking, best behaved, best taught bachelor in the village.

Couldn't we, Miles?\" The appeal touched the young man's heart : he saw only the loving fondness of the girl on the eve of marriage, clinging to him in his misfortune, willing to share his altered lot, and pointing to the only means she knew to prevent their separation, and assist him to rise again.

Miles folloAved her glance with his own ; then, as an inkling of the truth dawned upon his mind, answered coldly, \" If thou sets more store on thy new clothes than on having a husband able to look his neighbours in the face without shame, oi cannot tell. But if thou love ME, not the finery, and can wait till oi'm again able to keep thee as thy father's daughter and my wife should be kept, they may be put by till our wedding-day does come !\" The tone more than the words stung Ph\u0153be ; she was vain and thoughtless, but she did love Miles in her secret heart, and when she thought at all, which was not often, acknowledged that he had a nobler mind than her own, and had a full appreciation of the worth of his affections.

He was used to active labour, and never shrank from work \u2014 \" oidleness he couldna' aboide,\" so the lounging in separable from his watch was particularly irksome : as he afterwards said he would \" reather a' dun a good deay's pleughing.\" He walked round the house, unstopped by garden fence or paling, the fire having made a Avide gap in the wooden barrier, then back again, until he was tired of his Avalk through the trampled mire, and as the village sounds subsided to stillness, began to weary of the silence and monotony7. He had barely commenced his Avatch (rendered necessary because the strange tramps who had mingled amongst the crowd during the fire, might return to plunder the tenement if altogether de-"], [299, "THE DOG WITH A BAD NAME. 291 serted), and was propping up the doorway with his shoulder, when Matthew Spark hurried past him to his own door, with that sort of a headlong tipsy run, when the arms fly about like the sails of a wind mill, as a sort of counterpoise to the unsteady feet and heavy head, Avhich every now and then plunges forward toAvards the centre of gravity, then suddenly rights itself like a ship in a storm. Dick called to Matthew as he tumbled past, but re ceiving no reply, betook himself to his solitary walk. For a while he amused himself with watching the candles come and disappear from cottage windows, as one after another the inmates went to bed ; then the stillness increasing, and the cold (for April nights are chilly), he stamped his feet, paced round the three sides of the cottage he was lest to guard, whistled to break the silence ; and when satisfied there was no one about, opened the cottage door, and fastening it behind him (he had previously bolted the back door), seated himself on the stairs, not knowing where to find a more comfortable seat. But the smoke was still stifling ; so Avith a sort of dissatisfied grunt, he turned out once more, and retrod his path to the back of the building. As he turned the corner of the gable, he thought he observed a dark object crouching in the shadow of a portion of the shed yet upstanding. The smoke arising from the smoul- u2"], [300, "292 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. dering embers >vas yet so dense as to render its form indistinguishable, and when he approached the spot it was gone. Concluding in his own mind that he had mistaken in the dark night the wreathing smoke for a palpable figure, he continued to pace about till he was tired of his idle task, and moreover, very sleepy, for people accustomed to regular hours and unbroken rest, are the very worst of night-watchers. At last he betook himself once more to his seat on the stairs, wet as they were ; and though the smoke had cleared away so as to be no longer suffocating, it was quite dense enough to overpower his half-aAvake senses until he snored in very unromantic sleep. The sound of breaking glass disturbed his dreams, but did not waken up his faculties so quickly as to acquaint him whence it proceeded. He listened as he sat, but that sound had ceased ; rose lazily, and having mastered the fact that there was a noise in Miles's bedroom, groped his way upstairs to the burnt-out chamber ; not so noiselessly, hoAvever, but the intruder was made aware of his approach, and he crossed the room floor only in time to see the figure of a man blocking up the window in retreat. Darting forward he made a grasp at the man's shoulders, but as his hand closed on the left arm of the other, a handful of snuff was thrown dexterously into his face,"], [301, "THE DOG WITH A BAD NAME. 293 the arm wrenched from his loosened clasp, and the man was gone, long before he had recovered his sight or bewildered senses. Sneezing and swearing by turns, wiping his eyes on his falling neckcloth, and spitting out the foul poAvder which had found ready entrance at his open mouth, Dick blundered downstairs once more, and searched as diligently as he could in the dark, with his smarting eyes, but nothing could be seen of the prowling burglar. As he returned, under the window in the gable he stumbled over something in his path ; it was a large hammer, and this he shouldered, with a full determination to lay it about the shoulders of its owner if he could catch him. It was long past seven o'clock before Miles came to relieve guard, a late hour for him ; but he shrank from the very thought of the desolation of his home, and still more from the actual contemplation of the grim fact. Jaded and weary from excitement and over-exertion, he had slept longer than usual, had loitered in dressing, breakfasted sloAvly, and lingered, loath to face the truth in searching daylight; until Ralph, growing impatient, reminded him he wur keepi'n' Dick waitin' theer without his breakfast. It was indeed a sad scene for the young man, broken Avindows, charred frames, and blackened walls marked where the fire had smote one-half his dwell-"], [302, "294 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. ing. Of his shed, so lately resonant with sounds of busy industry, nothing remained but a mass of charred timber and iron fused into strange masses, with the admixture of other substances. This, how ever, did not lie on the surface ; he saAV nothing but the embers and little spiral columns of smoke still rising here and there from the black heap. Dick had ceased, with the growing daylight, to parade the ground or shoulder his strangely-acquired Aveapon ; but he sat on the kitchen settle Avith it beside him, Avhen Miles raised the latch. After a feAV Avords of thanks and sympathy, Dick rose to go, carrying the hammer Avith him. \" What did you borrow Mat's hammer for, Dick ? were you afraid of any one breaking in ? \" asked Miles, listlessly. \" Mat's hommer ! did you say Mat's hommer ? \" echoed Dick, curiously7. \"Yes, Mat's hammer,\" repeated Miles, \"Isn't it his?\" \" Oi dunnut know ; oi didna borrow it, that's a' ! An' oi wasna afeart o' onybody breakin' in ; but some mon did break in, an' thot hommer 's hisn, be his neame that or ought else ! \" answered Dick, promptly but doggedly, scanning the tool in his hand curiously. \" Some one broke in do you say ? What could any one want in a ruin like this? Did you catch th'man?\""], [303, "THE DOG AVITH A BAD NAME. 295 The former of these queries were addressed by J files as much to himself as any one, the last to Dick, Avho answered at once, \" Na, na, th' vagabon' Avur too sharp for that ; oi wur well noigh bloinded Avi' snuff he chucked i' mea feace, or oi shouldn ha' let go th' grip oi had on his coat ! \" \" Then you did see the man ? What Avas he like ?\" \" Na, oi didna, \u2014 oi saw a mon, or the sheape o' one, but oi wur in the dark, an' th' smoake wur thick, an' th' snuff played th' vary divil wi' moi oyes, so oi couldna tell who he Avur from Adam. But there's his hommer, an' mebbe thot '11 tell who th' mon wur. Anyhow, oi'm goin' to tak' it to the measter roight aweay ; he'll foind th' owner for't, or moi neame's not Deak ! \" So saying Dick marched off Avith the hammer in triumph to his master, resisting Ralph Home's invi tation to breakfast, lest his story should cool, or the clumsy tool leave his hands for an instant. Meanwhile Miles went over his disordered dwelling with an aching heart ; the hearth Avas cold, his house hold goods were scattered and dispersed, whether preserved by neighbours or pillaged by strangers he kneAV not. Fire and water, rough hands, and tramp ling feet had made sad havoc of the rooms specially prepared against the bridal \u2014 the parlour and the chamber over it. Portable goods were gone, and"], [304, "296 god's PROVIDENCE HOUSE. much of the heavy oak furniture as remained was charred and mutilated. The new tent bedstead which had replaced his own low truckle was burnt and broken; dirty, tindery rags fluttered in the morning air, Avhere dimity or gingham had hung as curtain or valance, odd bits of broken glass, and hanging strips of lead told where Avindows had been ; every trace of cleanliness or homely comfort was burnt or washed out, and the young man, over powered by his emotions, sat down on the now shapeless bedstead, and burying his face in his hands gave Avay to his grief. There he was found an hour later, sitting, moody and inactive, by Ph\u0153be, Avhose anxiety to know the worst was as great as his reluctance had been. Shocked and sad, but not overpoAvered, not haring the mind to comprehend all the wreck meant to him, with a feAv natural sighs at the scene of desolation before her, she at once strove to rouse her absorbed lover from his mournful contemplations. Coy and shy as was the artful little jade on ordinary occasions, nOAv she lavished on him kisses and loving Avords no endearments of his had won from her before. In her efforts to rouse him she forgot all but her love and his sorroAv, a sorroAv as much for her as for himself. He rose at length, soothed and refreshed by her unwonted tenderness ; promised to \" cheer up,\" and"], [305, "THE DOG WITH A BAD NAME. 297 \"for her sake,\" exert himself, and followed her doAvn stairs in time to meet Mr. Ford, who had just entered with Dick, still the hammer-bearer. Knots of idlers Avere outside, apparently discussing a subject of moment with much earnestness; fingers pointed and heads nodded alternately in the direction of the smithy and the late shed, and curious eyes followed Mr. Ford and Dick. The latter had com municated to his master not only the occurrence of the night, but the wheehvright's involuntary recogni tion of the hammer as \" Mat's :\" and this Michael coupled with the general suspicion that Matthew Spark had burned down his neighbour's shed to prevent the marriage. On entering Shotwick, he found the popular feeling ran very high against Matthew, one and all declaring he ought to be taken before the Justice. Over and over again, Miles Wood had ransacked his brain for the probable cause of his misfortune ; he had heard the outcry against Matthew as he entered the Black Bear, much as might a man in a dream, attaching no importance to it ; and noAv that the subject was brought clearly before him, he was equally umvilling to suspect his neighbour of so foul a deed. But, notwithstanding that Matthew Avas the boon companion of every man in the village willing to"], [306, "298 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. carouse or quarrel with him, and Miles held himself more apart, having risen above their dead level ; to a man they preferred the latter, influenced perhaps by the respect they felt, without knowing Avherefore. Consequently, when circumstances pointed to Mat thew as the perpetrator of the crime committed in their midst, the general indignation rose above the opinion of Miles, and the smith Avas dragged from his forge, as he was, in his leathern-apron, to the parsonage, for the pursy parson was likewise a Justice of the peace. Mr. Ford accompanied the crowd, in order to see justice done, lest popular prejudice and clamour should outweigh truth (being of course himself a man without prejudices !) and to him the Reverend Justice extended his hand in ceremonious welcome, ignoring the presence of the minor multitude, Avho only came for \" justice \" on an alleged offender. But Michael, waving all complimentary ceremonial, brought the case in point before him at once, and certainly did not prejudge it. He reminded the Justice that there had been a fire in the village the previous night, and that the Avheehvright's shed Avas destroyed, together Avith a portion of his house, and that suspicion fell on Matthew Spark as the incendiary. \" So my curate informed me, Mr. Ford,\" drawled out"], [307, "299 THE DOG WITH A BAD NAME. the pompous dignitary with a thick voice muffled in folds of fat. \" But this is a most se-ri-ous charge \u2014 not to be investigated lightly. Arson is a crime of great magnitude, and I grieve to think one of my parishioners should ever come under so weighty a suspicion ;\" and the muffled tones rose and fell with the prolonged cadence, yet peculiar to much pulpit oratory. Turning, as he spoke, from Mr. Ford to MattheAV, he continued : \" And what have you to say, my man, against this se-ri-ous accu-sa-tion ? \" \" Oi didna do it, yo'r honor, oi didna ! Oi wur at the Black Bear Avhen the foire broke out ! \" \" An theer he stayed while th' place wur brunning down ! \" blurted out several eager voices at once. \" Silence!\" commanded the Justice; and when the clamour loAvered to a buzzing hum \u2014 \"Is there any ev-i-dence against this man ? \" he demanded, looking round. First one neighbour stepped forward and then ano ther, and deposed to Matthew's jealousy, his drunken threats, his absence from the fire when all other hands were busied in its extinction ; and finally, Job Last deposed that he had heard him in the Black Bear a week before, remark, in reference to the projected marriage, \" Theer's many a slip 'twixt the coop an' lip.\" 1 \" Oi on'y repeated what'n John Tonks hadn said"], [308, "300 god's providence house. afore me ! whoi dunna yo lay it on him, he be as loike to ha' dun it as oi,\" boldly outspoke Matthew. \" Silence ! \" again exclaimed the Justice, and his clerk echoed the Avord in a higher key, as a murmur rose from the crowd. \" Who is this John Tonks ? is he present ? \" demanded the parson, Avhile Miles, lost in thought, revolved an incident in his oavu mind. \" I can answer that,\" said Mr. Ford. \" He is an expert locksmith from Chester, recommended to me by a friend to alter my locks at the Grange. I have not seen him in this neighbourhood for some time past ! And I do not see any motive he could possibly have to commit this crime.\" Mr. Ford's opinion Avas received as conclusive evi dence in favour of the absent John Tonks ; and the Rev. Justice proceeded to inquire, \" Is there any more ma-te-ri-al evidence against this man Matthew Spark ? \" Dick stepped forward, Avith the hammer in his hands. \" Whear did yo gett'n thot hommer from ? it's moine ! \" asked Matthew in surprise, not yet suffi ciently sober to see he made a dangerous admission. \" Oi fund it on th' grund under th' Avindow o'th' brunt bedroom, whare th' mon dropped down ith middle o'th' neeght, after bloinding mea Avi' snoof!\""], [309, "301 THE DOG WITH A BAD NAME. answered Dick sturdily in reply to his question, and looking steadily at the smith, who seemed puzzled \u2014 not conscious. In answer to questions from the presiding repre sentative of wisdom and justice, Dick very clearly detailed the circumstances attending his night watch, and laid the hammer on the table for inspection. Matthew had already identified it as his ; and that gave force to its weight as a silent witness against him. The magistrate looked very grave and solemn, turned over the leaves of Burn's Justice, and, finally, expressed to Michael his opinion that he feared he should be compelled to commit the smith, although the evidence Avas far from conclusive. But Miles, who had hitherto remained silent, not having been called upon to speak, now came forward unasked, and expressed his conviction that Matthew had nothing whatever to do with the fire ; and that John Tonks Avas more likely the guilty man. \" Have you any rea-son-able foun-da-tion for this un-sup-port-ed assertion ? \" questioned the Justice de liberately. \" Well, oi think oi have. John Tonks owes me a grudge for a cudgelling and knocking him into a ditch when he was rude to Ph\u0153be Home ; and he threatened me then. Besides, oi met him on my"], [310, "god's providence house! 302 road home, and he Avished us joy at our wedding, with a sort of sneer.\" \" Those are slight grounds for so serious an ac-cu sa-tion, Miles Wood. Have you nothing fur-ther to advance ? \" \" Yes ; moi parlour-windoAV fits the corner of the house like two AvindoAvs, facing both the street and moi shed. Noav, oi had a box nigh that Avindow, and there oi kept my money. Oi remember counting the guineas over about a fortnight back, and when oi had locked up the box and raised moi head oi saw John Tonks in the street looking at me and showing his ugly teeth as if his mouth Avatered to get at the gold. So oi straightway carried the box upstairs into moi bedroom, and now that box is gone.\" \" It may have been burned,\" suggested Michael. \" It may, certainly ; but something tells me it Avas not, and that John Tonks was more likely to bum down my shop than Matthew, Avho, poor fellow, is more his own enemy than mine, or anybody else's. Besides, Matthew was too drunk to have climbed to moi AvindoAV, and I never heard of his taking snuff.\" The conclusion of his argument helped to overturn the prejudices of the magistrate, who did not think drunkenness criminal. Questions were asked and ansAvered, and as no one could prove that Matthew"], [311, "THE DOG WITH A BAD NAME. 303 Avas nearer the shop that evening than his OAvn forge, and as it Avas urged that the hammer might have been taken from the smithy by some stranger helping to beat down the blazing shed, and thrown down when done with, he was dismissed by the clerical Justice for want of sufficient evidence, but with a reminder that very heavy suspicion attached to him, and that he was liable to be brought before him again should anything transpire to warrant such a step. With regard to John Tonks, both Michael and the Justice agreed that it was absurd to suspect him, since he had not been seen in the village for more than a Aveek, was a man well recommended, and had been met by Miles so close to Chester as to preclude the possibility of his commission of the deed. \" Consider, Miles,\" said Mr. Ford, addressing the wheelwright, who shook his head unconvinced, \" Con sider, the man is lame ; would it have been possible for him to limp four good miles, to the spot where you met, and you walk over three and a half back (seven and a half in all), whilst a fire kindled amongst dry wood and shavings gathered to a blaze ? I Avas in the village, and saAv the fire break out ; in five minutes the blaze shot through the roof; ten had not elapsed Avhen you were on the scene, and saAv how rapidly the flames spread. It is therefore self-evident you must have passed John Tonks at least half-an-"], [312, "304 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. hour before the wicked incendiary, whoever he may be, put a light to the building. Besides, if the lock smith did eye your guineas greedily, he was too lame to clamber to a Avindow on an upper floor, nor does he look like a man to indulge in the fashionable folly of snuff-taking any more than Matthew. Then, if he Avere disposed to rob you, his own tools Avere lighter and fitter for the purpose than that heavy hammer ; and he might have secured your gold, if thievishly inclined, without the noise or commotion of a fire, so likely to destroy the very thing he coveted. What say you, Mr. Tait ? \" appealing to the listening Justice. \" I have listened to your ar-gu-ment, my good sir, with pro-found atten-tion, and must say I agree Avith your con-clu-sions to the very letter. I could not grant a warrant for the ap-pre-hen-sion of the man John Tonks (Miles had asked for one) on so very un-rea-son-able and in-con-clu-sive a suspicion ; nor Avould any ma-gis-trate in the coun-ty unless more direct ev-i-dence con-nect-ed the man with the crime,\" droned out the Rev. Mr. Tait in reply ; and after a few gasps (like a gold-fish) to recover his breath after his long speech, he resumed in most oracular tones, \" It appears to me somewhat remarkable that the sufferer from the fire should ex-on-er-ate the man sus-pected by all his neigh-bours, and towards whom"], [313, "305 THE DOG WITH A BAD NAME. cir-cum-stances point ve-ry sus-pi-cious-ly ; and con demn another, miles away at the time, without a shred of ev-i-dence against him.\" \" Well, gentlemen,\" said Miles despondingly, \" your learning gets the better of me in argument ; but oi know Mat to be a good-natured fellow in the main, put out, to be sure, about Ph\u0153be, and given to drink more than does him good, but he's hasty and hot headed, more like to knock me doAvn in fair fight and have done with it, than go and ruin me on the sly. No, gentlemen ; begging your pardon for venturing a different opinion, oi'm morally7 sure that sneaking red-haired, long-toothed, limping devil has done the mischief, curse him ! \" Matthew had hurried off immediately after the unpromising permission accorded to him, followed by most of the croAvd ; who, not partaking of the wisdom or penetration of the Justice, clung pertinaciously to their first impressions, and, as they went, hooted and reviled the poor fellow in no very measured terms ; and Avhen he at last reached his own door, clustered round it, discussing the facts against him in tones sure to reach the inmate, for whom they were in tended. That day Matthew stuck at his work, only ham mering away more fiercely, as one rude urchin after another poked his head in at the open doorway, VOL. II. x"], [314, "306 god's providence house. or ran past, bawling out, \" Whow set foire to th shed?\" The next day, and the next, he was to be found on his old seat, the long-settle in Ralph Home's \" house place,\" pipe in mouth, and mug in hand. But his former boon companions shunned him, refused to be treated to drink ; men no-ways better than himself sneered at him, and stung him with hints or open accusation. At first he fought for his reputation, but men refused even to fight with him. At last, towards the end of the week, he caught a glimpse of Ph\u0153be at the door of the half-burned house, and staggering up to her, hoped she did not think he could have done that, as he pointed to the ruins. Not disposed to be lenient to the suspected man, whose worst fault had been loving himself too little, and her too much, she tossed her pretty head angrily, and turned away from him, as she exclaimed testily, \" Indeed, but I do, you're not one bit too good to have done that, or any other wicked thing. I hate the sight of you!\" With a groan he clasped his right hand over his eyes, staggered, with more than drink, to his own house, closed the door, and was seen no more that night. Next day, Sunday, house and forge remained shut up, but on the Monday morning both were open and empty. Matthew Spark was gone !"], [315, "307 THE DOG WITH A BAD NAME. His flight confirmed suspicion in every breast save that of Miles, Avho clung pertinaciously to the belief that John Tonks, and no other, was the incendiary, a belief scouted by every one besides, even Ph\u0153be only half concurring ; so he kept his opinion to him self, in the hope to discover the truth in the long run. Miles had seen the threatening demon-face, as the bad eyes glowered upon him from the ground in the Grange Lane, after his well-merited chastisement, and had never forgotten that evil look, or the clenched hand : and now an instinctive perception revived the scene, and pointed out John Tonks, saying, \" That is the man.\" Spite of Mr. Ford's cogent reasoning, which went to prove the contrary, Miles felt rather than reasoned on the subject, for reason was at fault \u2014 he could prove nothing, only guess. From the day when John Tonks was summoned to the Grange to alter locks, he began to frequent the village, wherefore was not apparent. Occasionally he had a job or two in the neighbourhood ; persuaded Ralph Home to have his old locks refitted, hung the large bell at the Griffin gate, called to see if the locks were in good order ; but the pretexts on which he honoured Shotwick with his presence were generally as lame as his leg. Miles regarded these visits with x2"], [316, "308 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. suspicion, notwithstanding the advances of the lock smith, who invariably thrust his ugly head in at the open window of the Avheelwright's shed, and after glancing furtively around, Avith a leer extended his dirty palm to Miles, saying, \" Shake hands, my fine fellow, I bear no malice, not I ; let by-gones be by-gones ! \" Notwithstanding this, Mdes regarded him Avith abhorrence, and never cared to con ceal it. It was the sight of those gloAvering eyes fixed on his hoarded guineas, the frugal savings of industrious years, which hastened their transference to the Old Bank, for though Miles had for some little time contemplated the step as desirable, no urgency was apparent, until the greedy looks and twitching fingers of John Tonks told that he coveted the glittering coins. Miles read the foul heart in the evil eyes, and it needed but Matthew's remonstrant hint to tell him Avhom he had to thank for his loss. No one shared in this opinion, and he was fain to keep it to himself; but Avhenever the locksmith passed through the village afterwards, as he did now and then, displaying his fangs between the tightly-stretched lips, and leering through half- shut eyelids over his shoulder at the busy wheelwright : there was that in the penetrating glance of honest Miles which made the"], [317, "THE DOG WITH A BAD NAME. 309 wretch cower and slink past conscience-stricken, even though, behind his back, he raised a threatening fist, and grinned defiantly. Mr. HeyAvood's recommendation was at the base of Mr. Ford's argument in John Tonks's favour, though he reasoned cogently and from circumstances ; but circumstances often lie like truth ; and so Miles's perception hit the mark the logicians missed. No one had seen John Tonks in the village that afternoon, yet had he entered in the early twilight through paths of his OAvn, and creeping stealthily under the shadowing hedgerows to the back of the wooden shed, picked a large loose knot out of a plank about a yard from the ground, in the corner where he had observed the chips and shavings a? ere kept. From his wallet he drew a bottle of the oil he used in his trade, and inserting the neck in the knot hole, poured the contents on the inflammable heap beneath. Next he produced a long flexible fusee, or slow-match, and this also he passed through the aperture until it rested amongst the shavings, leaving a considerable portion outside the building ; then he dipped a small match, (not unlike the lucifers of the present generation) into a tiny bottle, containing some dark chemical fluid, and the match ignited with a flash. This he applied to the fusee (which had a very small bag of gunpowder at the inner end),"], [318, "310 GOD'S PROVIDENCE HOUSE. and it began to smoulder slowly but surely on. With a well-satisfied grin, he replaced bottle aud match in the Avallet, and sneaking quietly towards the house, clambered like a cat, or a sailor, up a pear-tree nailed against the Avail ; with a chisel loosened the homely catch of the leaded window, and felt along the table for the money-box. That secured, he hastened back, and gloating 0A7er his prize, thrust it hurriedly into the wallet, lifted that to his shoulder, and decamped, keeping out of sight until clear of the village. Avoiding the ordinary road, which led at once into the Parkgate road, he pursued by-lanes, passing through Soughall ; and it was on entering the high way at the cross roads (where George Latham was attacked), that he met the happy wheelwright, whistling in the contentment of his soul. Here he startled Miles by wishing him \"joy of the wedding !\" As he limped past with so sinister a smile, the heart of Miles sank Avith sad forebodings, only too soon realized. WhOe the quick limp of the one carried him to a distance, and the firm, rapid step of the other brought him nearer ; slowly, slowly, slowly the match burned down ; slowly but surely to the diminutive poAvder mine, and then the work Avas done. Little powder is required to set oil and shavings alight, and, as Michael had said, in five miuutes the flames shot"], [319, "311 THE DOG WITH A BAD NAME. upwards and waved their red banners in the sky, as signals to the home-comer. In his den, wherever that might be, John Tonks hugged himself with delight, at the mischief he had done, and gloated over the prospect of mischief yet to do. Then with wolfish talons he Avrenched open the little box and found \u2014 disappointment. A few silver pence and shillings, and a couple of crowns \u2014 no more, not a single guinea ! His revenge was incomplete ! his avarice unallayed ! He must have the gold and would, or his work was but half done. And so he returned, stole a hammer from the drunken blacksmith's open smithy, left it to tell a lying tale, and scrambled upwards to the Avin dow once more. But the glass, cracked and broken by the heat, shook at his touch from the loosened leads, and roused the sentinel placed below unknown to him. Believing he had an open house to himself, he began to search for coffer or cupboard where the store might be hid, when Dick's lumbering steps warned him away. The supply of snuff he kept in a pocket loose and ready for such emer gencies, and had found it handy more than once or twice. But no one suspected John Tonks (except MUes, and he was outvoted), who came and went like inno cence itself through the village, whence Matthew had"], [320, "312 god's providence house fled in despair, bearing the heavy burdens of a bad habit, a breaking heart, and a foul aspersion. Before the cottage or shed could be rebuilt, the assurance surveyor had to assess the damage in the interest of the office, and of Mr. Latham (who, as Michael predicted, had a long relapse through his exertions in the night rain), but those calculations once made, Mr. Peover's men were soon at work ; the house was rendered habitable'once more, and the frail wooden shed Avas replaced by a larger one of brick and mortar, well tiled. Mr. Ford renewed his offers of pecuniary assistance, but Miles steadily declined, urging that Avith SOL providentially saved in the bank to give him a fresh start, he had no right- to burden himself Avith a debt. He should work better with his hands free ; any orders Mr. Ford gave should be promptly attended to, so far as his crippled means would permit; and he hoped to overcome difficulties by persevering industry ; but he could not work if a debt tied his hands. Michael clapped him on the shoulder approvingly, owned he was right, and encouraged him in his honest endeavours. But before the moon was a week older, a set of good tools were brought by the carrier for the independent young man, carriage paid. And later on, sundry articles of useful furniture came by tho same carrier (Avithout any clue to the sender), one at"], [321, "313 THE DOG AVITH A BAD NAME. a time, to replace those destroyed or damaged ; orders flowed steaddy in, and before the summer waned he had partly recovered from his loss. His business prospered, and for a time his lov7a, but Ph\u0153be, prone to range, grew ambitious ; she had in secret a more eligible offer, and though she loved and esteemed Miles, her vanity was not proof against temptation. The vague and mysterious \" some one \" was more frequently referred to ; and in proportion as the hopes of her lover sank lower in despondence, her spirits rose higher and higher. END OF VOL. II.
