The Angela of the Ages, -which forms the title and introduction of the following poem, represent thoBe who appear in Holy Scripture commissioned to minister in human affairs, specially at great epochs of the divine dispensations. With the single exception of their introduction, which was necessary for the structure of the poem, it -will be seen that these intimations have been, either literally or in effect, adhered to strictly. The poem opens with a supposed meeting of the Angels of the Ages, who rehearse among themselves, without formal specification of the speakers, the story, as follows, of human life \u2014 its prime, its downfall, the antediluvian world, its wickedness, and destruction by the flood, the ark, and the patriarch Noah's burnt-offerings, and the bow and covenant of God, with their significancy, the human race u [-.changed after the flood, their forgetfulness of God, the light vouchsafed to them, the witness of the patriarchs, and of the chosen people, followed by the moral and desperate declension of the whole race, the coming of the Mighty One, His temptation, the great Burnt Sacrifice, the resurrection and ascension of the Son of God, His kingdom on the earth, the world towards its end, the coming of the Judge, the final separation, and the everlasting kingdom.

On the contrary, it is represented in Scripture as the \" sheath of the spirit,\"1 as if in some way conservative of it. The fact is that each is divinely adapted to the other. The body is an aggre- gate of instrumentalities, by means of which the spirit is enabled to carry on its own higher operations more richly and more perfectly. Besides, their oneness, except in the comparatively brief interval of their unnatural and temporary divorce by death, is otherwise indissoluble. Even in that state the disembodied spirit is, we are informed by divine authority, waiting as one bereaved, and, as it were, impatient to rejoin its partner, made ready to be its mightier helpmeet in the unity of a more glorious co-existence. The real clog or encumbrance to 1 Daniel vii. 15 : The prophet says, \"I was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body\" (sheath)."], [66, "60 APPENDIX. man, properly so called, is to be found in himself, in the struggle there between the old chaotic creation, which is to pass away, and the new creation, which is to last for ever. May we add here, that in an analogous but in a deeper sense, to be interpreted with carefulness, the eternal Word became wedded to manhood, as His helpmeet, one with it, and, though temporarily separated from Him by death, otherwise for ever indissoluble, and so, to speak reverently, was enabled, by its union with Himself, to achieve the higher purposes of His Godhead in our redemption. There is, however, one great distinction between the two instances. In the one the helpmeet is the body united to the spirit ; in the other, the manhood body, soul, and spirit, is united to God. APPENDIX B. What animal answers to all the points in the descrip tion of Behemoth is still undetermined. Our wary translators commit themselves to nothing in the autho rized version beyond the curt marginal note, \"the elephant, as some think.\" Recent and more confident expositors affirm that the hippopotamus fully answers to the des cription, which, however, is to be doubted. Behemoth"], [67, "APPENDIX. 61 is represented as a powerfully-armoured and most for midable animal, and as pasturing on mountains, neither of which will apply to the hippopotamus, a beast am phibious, and rather timid than otherwise. With regard to the elephant, it cannot be said to eat grass like an ox, nor can it be said of its proboscis that it is a nose, and strong to pierce through snares. We venture to suggest that the animal which fully answers to the description is the rhinoceros. It frequents alike marshes and moun- tains. It pastures. One cannot look at it without being struck with the formidableness of its appearance. Its armoured loins, and what may be called its nose, crested with that terrible horn, so fatally adapted to rip up and so strong to pierce through snares, seem, with every other point, to justify its claim to be the Behemoth. APPENDIX C. \" The Flood.\" Recorded or traceable in the classics of antiquity, and in the traditionary lore of almost every ancient nation, such an event as tlie great Flood, in the universality of which we firmly believe, geological objections to the con-"], [68, "APPENDIX. 62 trary notwithstanding, could have been brought about only by extraordinary means, only by forces thereafter with- drawn, of a might so stupendous as to baffle conception. The raising of such a vast body of water to the height of fifteen thousand feet or more \u2014 that is, to the height of the Ararat range \u2014 from the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the supply of water by enormous vapour to sustain the formation of clouds, returning in long con- tinued and unintermittent torrents of rain, imply not only tremendous disruptions in the crust of the earth, but also an unusual action of the central fires for the production of so vast an evaporation. As a consequence of these disruptions, dislocations, and it may be subsi- dences, the very surface of the earth must have under- gone serious changes. The mighty antediluvian forests must have been overthrown, submerged, and subjected to the action of intense heat, and the waters themselves, in their motion and the sweep of their inevitable con- fluences, have teemed with innumerable substances of depository matter, swept up, and everywhere carried, and everywhere aud strangely deposited, as the waters gradu- ally subsided, and more or less embedded them. It is possible that animal life, like the human, may have been narrowed, that is, some branches of the animal races may have been extinguished, as were all but one of the human"], [69, "APPENDIX. 63 family, and that those only were retained and kept alive which were best adapted to the new conditions of the new world. It is significant that upon the occurrence of the Flood the duration of human Hfe was gradually but im mensely shortened \u2014 by divine appointment indeed \u2014 but acting, as always, through means, as if something in the conditions of existence favourable to greater longevity before the Flood had been seriously modified by it afterwards. These observations are not made for the purpose of advancing any theory, but only for the sake of giving prominency to facts, or, if the reader pleases, suggestions, worthy of greater consideration than they have been in the habit of receiving in discussions on the Deluge. APPENDIX D. \" Sounding the time.\" How wonderful the administration of the divine government, as it appears in the Bible history, from the beginning of the world down to the first coming of Christ ! We see depicted there, in the foreground, the gradual unfoldings of the grand remedial promise, and the course"], [70, "64 APPENDIX. of the Church of God in a long line of saints, of patri- archs, and of prophets, whilst in the background, in dim grandeur, glimpses are given us of successive prefatory empires subsidiary to and converging towards the mystery of the Advent. Looking forward from this standpoint, through the medium of revelation, we behold the further unfolding of the same government, its central subject still, the unseen Sun of Righteousness, advancing through clouds towards the glory of His final appearing, and with Him the Church of God along its chequered but expanding course, and round about Him kingdoms and empires, under His golden sceptre or His iron rod, in travail towards the awful crisis, when this wondrous system of divine government shall have completed its mighty cycle, and the inhabiters of all the ages shall stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, and the voice of the archangel proclaim that time shall be no longer. So vast a system, so harmonious, so complete, standing alone in the world's history, could only have been given by the inspiration of that omniscient Spirit who saw the end from the beginning, and could only be carried into effect by the administration of an all-overruling and Providence.
