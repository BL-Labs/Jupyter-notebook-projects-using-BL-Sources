WHEN~proposals were first issued for publishing the Naval Temple, an account of the battles that had taken place between the navy of the United States and that of Great Britain during the late war was promised. \u2014 The very generous manner in which the undertaking was patronised, has induced the publisher to enlarge his plan, and embrace a com plete view of the operations of the navy, from its origin, to the return of our squadron from the Mediterranean in 1815. The accounts are carefully selected from the best authorities, and uninteresting detail as much as possible avoided. It has been attempted to pre serve a connected narrative as far as the nature of the undertaking would permit, and to make the work something more than a mere collection of official documents and extracts from log-books. All the most important Documents may, however, be found in the Appendix. The limited size of the volume does not admit of so complete a history as some readers may ex pect, and the publisher regrets that his prospectus bad not contemplated a larger work, and a price"], [16, "IV ADVERTISEMENT. adequate to its value. But the enterprise was a new one, and he felt too diffident of success to incur the expense of so full and perfect a work as the sub ject merited.

II. ii. 551\u2014556. In the revolutionary war, which gave indepen dence, and character to the United States of Ame rica, several armed vessels were in commission, and performed exploits, that confer immortality on the names of Barry, Manly, Jones, and others. Dur ing the latter years of the contest, from the want of finances, the depreciation of paper currency, and, perhaps, still more, from the alliance with France 2"], [22, "10 NAVAL TEMPLE. supplying a naval force, little was done to augment, or even to maintain, that of our own nation ; and, shortly after the close of the war, the few ships, that had constituted the navy, were sold by order of Congress. The depredations committed on our commerce in the Mediterranean, by the piratical corsairs of the Barbary powers, induced Congress, in 1794, to undertake the formation of a naval force for its protection. Four ships, of forty-four guns each, and two of thirty-six, were ordered to be built. The act, authorizing the construction of these ships, passed the twenty-seventh day of March, which may be considered as the day that gave existence to the navy of the United States. The creation and establishment of a permanent and efficient naval force, for the protection of com merce and the defence of the seacoast in case of war, had always been advocated by Mr. John Adams ; and during the term of his presidency, from March, 1797, to March, 1801, the object was pursued with great zeal and energy. To no indi vidual is the nation more indebted, than to Mr. Adams ; and posterity will hail him as the father OF THE AMERICAN NAVY. In 1798, there were in service twenty vessels ; in 1799, upwards of thirty. A law was passed, directing the building of six seventy-four gun ships, which, however, was never carried into effect. In 1801, the navy consisted of the following ships:"], [23, "11 NAVAL TEMPLEi United States 44 guns President 44 Constitution 44 Philadelphia 44 Chesapeake 36 Constellation 36 Congress 36 New York 36 Boston 32 Essex 32 Adams 32 John Adams 32 General Greene 32 All the other publick vessels were ordered by Congress to be sold, and the building of those authorized was suspended. CAPTAIN THOMAS TRUXTON Was one of the first six captains appointed by the President, at the organization of the naval es tablishment, in 1794. He was directed to superin tend the building of the Constellation, of 36 guns, at Baltimore, and to take the command of her when equipped. * The commerce of the United States having suf fered much from the ravages of the French, both in"], [24, "12 NAVAL TEMPLE. national vessels and privateers, Captain Truxton was sent with a squadron to the West Indies for its protection. On the ninth of February, 1799, at noon, the island of Nevis bearing w. s. w. five leagues dis tant, the Constellation being then alone, a large ship was discovered to the southward, which proved to be the French frigate Insurgente, of forty guns and four hundred and seventeen men. Commodore Truxton bore down upon her, and, at a quarter past three, ranging along side, poured a broadside into her, which was immediately returned. After a warm action of an hour and a quarter, the French ship struck : twenty-nine of her crew were killed, and forty-four wounded. The Constellation had only one man killed, and two wounded. On the first of February, 1 800, the Constellation being alone in the road of Basseterre, at half past seven a. m. Guadaloupe bearing eastward, about five leagues distant, a sail was discovered, which, on approaching, commodore Truxton ascertained to be a heavy French frigate, of fifty-four guns. He im mediately prepared his ship for action. He contin ued the chase till one the next day, when a fresh wind enabled him to gain upon her. At eight in the evening, having got within hail, he hoisted his en sign ; had all the candles in the battle lanterns light ed ; and was in the lee gang way, ready to speak to the French ship, when she commenced a fire from her stern and quarter guns at the rigging of the Con stellation. Having repeated the orders he had"], [25, "13 NAVAL TEMPLE. before given, commodore Truxton, in a few mo ments gained a position on the weather of the French ship, which enabled him effectually to return her broadside. After a close and severe action of about four hours, the fire of the French ship was completely silenced, and she sheered off, at the moment when Truxton considered her as his prize, and had ordered the tattered sails of the Constellation to be trimmed. It was then per ceived that the main-mast was totally unsupported by rigging, every shroud having been shot away. All efforts to support the mast were useless ; it went over the side in a few minutes, carrying all the top men with it.* Before the ship could be cleared of the shattered fragments, which was accomplished in about an hour, the French ship had effected her escape. Her disappearance was so sudden, that, the people on board the Constellation supposed she had sunk. She arrived at Curracoa, five days after the engagement, so shattered, that all her crew were continually employed at the pumps to keep her from sinking. She had one hundred and sixty men killed and wounded. Her captain stated that he had twice struck his colours; but, owing to the darkness, it was not perceived on board the Con stellation. Believing it was the determination of * James Jarvis, of New-York, a midshipman, commanded the main-top. He was apprized of his danger by a seaman, but had so high an opinion of the duty of an officer, that he replied, \" If the mast goes, we must go with it.\" This soon happened, and enly obc of the men was saved."], [26, "14 NAVAL TEMPLE. the American captain to sink him, he renewed the engagement from necessity. The Constellation had thirty-nine men killed and wounded. The French frigate was the Vengeance. CAPTAIN LITTLE.\u2014 FRIGATE BOSTON. The United States frigate Boston, commanded by captain Little, being on a cruise, to protect the American commerce in the West Indies, in latitude 22, 50, longitude 51, captured, on the 12th of Octo- ber, 1800, after an action of an hour and forty minutes, the French national corvette Le Berceau. The Boston mounted twenty-four 12, and eight 9 pounders, and had two hundred and thirty men, of whom six were killed, and eight wounded. Le Berceau was commanded by captain Senes, had twenty-two 9, and two 12 pounders, on one deck, and two hundred and thirty men. She lost all her masts, and was otherwise much disabled. She had been out from Cayenne twenty-five days, during which she had plundered two American vessels and made prize of one. On a former cruise she had captured several American vessels. A variety of circumstances conspired to render this capture of much importance. Le Berceau was considered one of the fastest sailing corvettes in the French navy ; she served as a look-out vessel to the French fleet for eighteen months, had frequently been chased"], [27, "15 NATAL TEMPLE. by British cruisers, but never overtaken ; and had been very successful in capturing British, American, and Portuguese vessels ; and was bound on this cruise to intercept the American Indiamen, and South American ships. Captain Senes had been post captain in the French navy for many years ; was a midshipman in count D'Estaing's fleet in the revolutionary war ; and was esteemed a brave and intelligent officer. Le Berceau lost in the engage ment her first lieutenant, master, boatswain, master gunner, and pilot, besides a number of seamen. Captain Senes, and a commissioner, who was in Le Berceau, after being in the Boston fifteen days, were, at their request, permitted to go toBarbadoes, on their parole. The Boston expended upwards of 27 cwt. of powder, upwards of 1 500 round shot, besides double that number of chain, double-headed, and grape, during the action. Captain Little arrived, with his prize, at Boston, the 14th of November. CAPTAIN STERRETT. In the month of August, 1801, Captain Sterrett, commander of the United States schooner Enter prize, of twelve guns, and ninety men, fell in, off Malta, with a Tripolitan cruiser of fourteen guns and eighty-five men. A desperate conflict en sued, and had continued for nearly two hours,"], [28, "16 NAVAL TEMPLE. when the Tripolitan hauled down her colours. The crew of the Enterprize left their guns, and gave three cheers for the victory. Upon this, the cruiser poured a broadside into the Enter prize, hoisted her colours, and renewed the action with redoubled vigour. Her crew, brandishing their sabres, continually attempted to board. They Avere again overcome by the skilful crew of the En terprize, and struck a second time. Captain Ster rett then ordered the cruiser under his quarter, and kept his men at the guns. But the Tripolitan had no sooner come to the position she was ordered, than she renewed the action the third time, by pour ing a broadside into the Enterprize. The Tripoli tans hoisted their bloody flag, and attempted to board. The indignant cry of \" Fight on, and sink the perfidious villains to the bottom,\" was now heard from every part of the American schooner. Every effort was made by Captain Sterrett to ensure a complete victory. His superior skill in the man agement of his vessel enabled him to rake the cor sair, fore and aft. A number of shot between wind and water, opened her sides for the sea to pour in. Fifty of her men were killed and wounded. Her treacherous commander, perceiv ing the destruction of his vessel and crew inevit able, implored for quarters. Bending in a sup plicating posture over the waste of his vessel, he threw his colours into the sea, to convince the American captain that he would no more attempt to resist. Captain Sterrett, actuated by the sen-"], [29, ""], [30, "fW/is 8TKRAETT i\u00ab t/tr Soft'.

His instructions not permitting him to make a prize of the cruiser, he ordered her crew to throw overboard all their guns, swords, pistols, ammunition, &c. and then to go and tell their countrymen the treatment they might expect from a nation, determined to pay tribute only in powder and ball. The Enterprize, in this engagement of three hours, did not lose a man. Captain Sterrett, after paying every attention to the wounded Tripolitans, ordered the cruiser to be dismantled. Her masts were cut down. A spar was raised, to which was hung a tattered sail, as a flag. In this condition she was sent to Tripoli. On her arrival there, the indignation, excited by her defeat, was so great, that the bashaw ordered the wounded captain to be mounted on a jack-ass, and paraded through the streets as an object of publick scorn ; and then to receive five hundred bastinadoes. The Tripolitans were so terrified at this event, that the sailors aban doned the cruisers then fitting out. Not a man could be procured to navigate them.* * History of the war between the United State? and Tripoli. p. 91. 3"], [32, "18 NAVAL TEMPLE. SCHOONER EXPERIMENT.\u2014 LIEUTENANT STEWART. In July, 1800, lieutenant Charles Stewart was appointed to the command of the Experiment, of twelve guns, and ordered to cruise in the West In dies. He arrived on that station the first of Sep tember, and the same night fell in with the French schooner Deux Amis, of eight guns, which he en gaged and captured, without any loss, after an action of ten minutes. Soon after, while cruising near the island of Barbuda, he discovered a brig of war, and a three masted schooner, standing for the Experiment, under a press of sail, and displaying English colours. The Experiment was hove to, and the British signal of the day was made, which not being answered by the strange vessels by the time they were within gun-shot, that signal was hauled down, and the Experiment stood away with all sail set. A chase was now commenced by the enemy, and continued for about two hours ; when finding they were outsailed by the Experiment, they relinquish ed the pursuit, and bore away under easy sail, firing a gun to windward, and hoisting French colours. Lieutenant Stewart now man\u0153uvred his schooner so as to bring her in the enemy's wake, to windward, when a chase was made on his part, which contin ued the whole day before the wind, each vessel crowding all her canvass. At eight o'clock at night,"], [33, "19 NAVAL TEMPLE. the Experiment closed with the three-masted schooner, which was the sternmost of the hostile vessels ; and having taken a position on her lar board-quarter, opened a fire upon her from the great guns and small arms, which in about five minutes, compelled her to strike. She was immediately taken possession of, and proved to be the French schooner of war Diana, of fourteen guns and sixty five men, commanded by M. Peraudeau, lieutenant de Vaisseau. The detention occasioned by re moving the prisoners, enabled the brig of war to escape. She mounted, as was afterwards learned, eighteen guns, and had a crew of one hundred and twenty men. The Experiment proceeded to St. Christopher's with her prize. On the 14th of December, she fell in with the privateer Flambeau, of sixteen guns and ninety men, with a prize brig, steering for Marigalante. The breeze being light and the enemy to wind ward, it was late in the afternoon before there was any prospect of closing with him. Notwithstanding all the exertions of the Experiment, the Flambeau escaped in shore ; but her prize was retaken. This vessel proved to be the Zebra of and from Balti more, laden with flour. During the remainder of this cruise, the Experiment recaptured several American vessels, sometimes as many as two or three in a day, and thus rescued American pro perty to a considerable amount."], [34, "20 NAVAL TEMPLE. OPERATIONS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. As every incident and anecdote connected with the Tripolitan war has become extremely interest ing to the publick, we trust that the following cir cumstantial, though very imperfect, narrative of the operations of the squadron under Commodore Preble, will be read with satisfaction. The Tripolitan cruisers continuing to harass the vessels of the United States, Congress deter mined, in 1803, to act with greater vigour against them, and to fit out a fleet that should not only repel their unprovoked aggression, but also chastise their insolence. The squadron consisted of the Constitution, 44 guns ; the Philadelphia, 44 ; the Argus, 18; the Syren, 16; the Nautilus, 16; the Vixen, 16 ; and the Enterprize, 14. Commodore Preble was appointed to the command of this squadron, in May, 1803. On the thirteenth of August, commodore Preble sailed in the Constitution for the Mediterranean. On his passage he brought to a Moorish frigate, which he suspected had been authorized to cruise against American vessels ; but her papers not sup porting such a suspicion, he dismissed her. When he arrived at Gibraltar, he found that our affairs with Morocco had assumed a very disagreeable aspect."], [35, "21 NAVAL TEMPLE. Captain William Bainbridge, commanding the frigate Philadelphia, had sailed in July; and, on the twenty-sixth of August, had captured the Moorish ship Mirboha, of twenty-two guns, and one hundred and ten men. An order to cruise for American vessels was discovered among her papers. There was no signature to this order. The captain said it was delivered to him sealed, by the Moorish governour of Tangiers, who ordered him not to open it until at sea. By the authority of this order he had captured the American brig Celia, then in company. In May, captain Rodgers had detained a vessel, under Moorish colours, at tempting to enter Tripoli, then actually blockaded by him. On board of her were four guns, and other contraband articles. The emperour denied having authorized the latter ; and the governour of Tangiers disavowed having given any orders to cruise for Americans to the former. Commodore Preble, the day after his arrival, wrote to the Ame rican consul at Tangiers, that peace with the em perour of Morocco was desirable ; that since he disavowed the acts of hostility, committed by his subjects, he should punish as pirates all Moorish cruisers attempting to capture American vessels.* Commodore Rodgers, who, with the New York and John Adams, frigates, was under orders to return to the United States, consented to remain a few days on the station, and to proceed with com modore Preble to Tangier bay, to effect an adjust ment of existing differences. * Port Folio, vol. iii. p. 361."], [36, "22 NAVAL TEMPLE. On the seventeenth of August, commodore Preble appeared in Tangier bay, and hoisted a white flag in token of peace. The American consul was not permitted to go on board. Two sentinels were placed at his door. About this time another act of hostility was com mitted at Mogadore. It was an order given to detain all American vessels. The brig Hannah, of Salem, was actually seized. This determined the commodore to take a more decided course. He ordered his squadron to bring in all Moorish vessels for examination. He des patched vessels to cruise off Mogadore, Salee, Za rach and Tetuan, while he himself entered the bay of Tangiers from time to time. The Philadelphia and Vixen were ordered to lie before Tripoli. On the 5th of October, when the emperour of Morocco was expected at Tangiers, commodore Preble anchored the Constitution and Nautilus in the bay, within half a mile of the circular bat tery. In the afternoon of the 6th, he was joined by the frigates New York and John Adams. The ships were constantly kept clear for action, and the men night and day at their quarters. The emperour arrived on the 6th, with a great body of troops, who encamped on the beach opposite the American squa dron. The commodore saluted the emperour with twenty-one guns, which were returned by an equal number from the fort. A present of bullocks, sheep, and fowls, was sent to the American squa dron, as a token of the emperour's good will. On"], [37, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 23 the 8th, the emperour, attended by a body of troops, came to the beach for the purpose of viewing the American squadron. The Constitution again com plimented him with twenty-one guns, with which he was much gratified. The next day the American consul informed the commodore that the emperour had given orders for the American brig, detained at Mogadore, to be re leased; and that he would give audience to the American commodore and consul on the following Monday. On the day appointed, the commodore, accompa nied by four persons, went on shore. He ordered the officer, commanding the squadron during his absence, to fire upon the town, if he should be forcibly detained; and not to enter into any treaty for his release, nor be influenced by any considera tions for his personal safety. When arrived at the castle, they were conducted through a double file of soldiers to the emperour. The commodore, on entering, was requested to put away his side arms ; with this he declined complying; and was permit ted to retain them. The emperour expressed much sorrow and regret that any difference had arisen ; for it was his desire to be at peace with the Unit ed States. He denied having given any hostile orders; promised to restore all American vessels and property, detained by the authority of any of his governours; and renewed and consumed the treaty made with the United States in 1786. The commodore and consul, on the part of the United"], [38, "24 NAVAL TEMPLE. States, promised that the vessels and property be longing to the emperour, should be restored ; and the orders for capturing them revoked. Commodore Preble was now at liberty to direct his whole attention to Tripoli. The season was, however, too far advanced for active operations. On the 31st of October, the Philadelphia, being, at nine o'clock in the morning, about five leagues to the westward of Tripoli, discovered a sail in shore, standing before the wind to the eastward. The Philadelphia immediately gave chase. The sail hoisted Tripolitan colours, and continued her course near the shore. The Philadelphia opened a fire upon her, and continued it, till half past eleven ; when, being in seven fathoms water, and finding her fire could not prevent the vessel entering Tripoli, she gave up the pursuit, ln beating off, she ran on a rock, not laid down in any chart, distant four and a half miles from the town. A boat was imme diately lowered to sound. The greatest depth of water was found to be astern. In order to back her off, all sails were then laid aback ; the top-gallant sails loosened ; three anchors thrown away from the bows ; the water in the hold started ; and all the guns thrown overboard, excepting a few abaft to defend the ship against the attacks of the Tripoli tan gun-boats, then firing at her. All this, how ever, proved ineffectual ; as did also the attempt to lighten her forward by cutting away her foremast. The Philadelphia had already withstood the attack of the numerous gun-boats for four hours, when a"], [39, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 25 large reinforcement coming out' of Tripoli, and being herself deprived of every means of resistance, and defence, she was forced to strike, about sun set. The Tripolitans immediately took possession of her, and made prisoners of the officers and men, in number three hundred. Forty-eight hours after wards, the wind blowing in shore, the Tripolitans got the frigate off, and towed her into the harbour. On the 14th of December, commodore Preble sailed from Malta, in company with the Enterprize, commanded by lieutenant Stephen Decatur. On the 23d, the latter captured a ketch in sight of Tripoli; which place she had left the preceding night, bound to Bengaza. She was under Turkish colours, and was navigated by Turks and Greeks. On board of her were two Tripolitan officers of dis tinction, a number of Tripolitan soldiers, and about forty blacks belonging to the bashaw and his sub jects. The commodore had at first determined to release the vessel and men claimed by the Turkish captain ; and only detain the Tripolitans, about sixty in number, as prisoners. But before this de termination could be put in execution, he ascertain ed, that this same captain had been very active in assisting to take the Philadelphia. He had, on that occasion, received on board his vessel one hundred armed Tripolitans ; had changed his own colours for that of the enemy ; had attacked the frigate ; and, when she was boarded, had plundered the offi cers. This determined the commodore to retain the vessel. As she was in no condition to be sent i"], [40, "26 NAVAL TEMPLE. to the United States, he forwarded her papers to government. Soon after he had her appraised; and took her into the service as the ketch Intrepid. When lieutenant Decatur was informed of the loss of the Philadelphia, he immediately formed a plan of recapturing or destroying her, which he proposed to commodore Preble. At first the com modore thought the projected enterprise too hazard ous ; but at length granted his consent. Lieutenant Decatur then selected for the enterprise the ketch Intrepid, lately captured by. him. This vessel he manned with seventy volunteers, chiefly of his own crew ; and on the third of February sailed from Syracuse, accompanied by the brig Siren, lieuten ant Stewart. The Siren was to aid the boats ; and, in case it should be deemed expedient to use the Intrepid as a fire ship, to receive her crew. After a tempestuous passage of fifteen days, the two vessels arrived off the harbour of Tripoli, to wards the close of day. It was determined that at ten o'clock in the evening the Intrepid should enter the harbour, accompanied by the boats of the Siren. But a change of wind had separated the two vessels six or eight miles. As delay might prove fatal, lieutenant Decatur entered the harbour alone about eight o'clock. The Philadelphia lay within half gun shot of the Bashaw's castle and principal battery. On her starboard quarter lay two Tripo litan cruisers within two cables length ; and on the starboard bow a number of gun-boats within half gun-shot. All her guns were mounted and loaded."], [41, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 27 Three hours were, in consequence of the lightness of the wind, consumed in passing three miles, when, being within two hundred yards of the Philadelphia, they were hailed from her, and ordered to anchor on peril of being fired into. The pilot on board the Intrepid was ordered to reply, that all their anchors were lost. The Americans had advanced within fifty yards of the frigate, when the wind died away into a calm. Lieutenant Decatur ordered a rope to be taken out and fastened to the fore chains of the frigate, which was done, and the Intrepid was warped along side. It was not till then the Tripoli tans suspected them to be an enemy ; and their con fusion in consequence was great. As soon as the vessels were sufficiently near, lieutenant Decatur sprang on board the frigate, and was followed by midshipman Morris.* It was a minute before the remainder of the crew succeeded in mounting after them. But the Turks, crowded together on the quarter deck, were in too great consternation to take advantage of this delay. As soon as a sufficient number of Americans gained the deck, they rushed upon the Tripolitans, who were soon overpowered ; and about twenty of them were killed. After taking possession of the ship, a firing commenced from the Tripolitan batteries and castle, and from two corsairs near the frigate ; a number of launches were also seen rowing about in the har bour; whereupon lieutenant Decatur resolved to * Now Captain Morris."], [42, "28 NAVAL TEMPLE. remain in the frigate, for there he would be enabled to make the best defence. But perceiving that the launches kept at a distance, he ordered the frigate to be set on fire, which was immediately done, and so effectually, that with difficulty was the Intrepid preserved. A favourable breeze at this moment sprung up, which soon carried them out of the har bour. None of the Americans were killed, and only four wounded. For this heroick achievement lieutenant Decatur was promoted to the rank of post captain. His commission was dated on the day he destroyed the Philadelphia. After the destruction of the Philadelphia frigate, commodore Preble was, during the spring and early part of the summer, employed in keeping up the blockade of the harbour of Tripoli, in preparing for an attack upon the town, and in cruising. A prize that had been taken was put in commission, and called the Scourge. A loan of six gun-boats and two bomb-vessels, completely fitted for service, was obtained from the king of Naples. Permission was also given to take twelve or fifteen Neapoli tans on board each boat, to serve under the Ameri can flag. With this addition to his force, the commodore, on the 21st of July, joined the vessels off\" Tripoli. His squadron then consisted of the Frigate Constitution, 44 guns, 24 pounders. Brig Argus, 18 24 Syren, 18 18 Scourge,"], [43, "29 WAVAL TEMPLE. Schooner Vixen, 16 6 Nautilus, 16 6 Enterprize, 12 6 Besides six gun-boats, carrying each a twenty-six brass pounder, and two bomb-ketches, carrying each a thirteen inch mortar. The number of men en gaged in the service amounted to one thousand and sixty. On the Tripolitan castle and batteries, one hun dred and fifteen guns were mounted : fifty-five of which were pieces of heavy ordnance ; the others long eighteen and twelve pounders, ln the harbour were nineteen gun-boats, carrying each a long brass eighteen or twenty-four pounder in the bow, and two howitzers abaft : also two schooners of eight guns each, a brig of ten, and two galleys, of four guns each. In addition to the ordinary Turkish garri son, and the crews of the armed vessels, estimated at three thousand, upwards of twenty thousand Arabs had been assembled for the defence of the city. The weather prevented the squadron from ap proaching the city until the 28th, when it anchored within two miles and a half of the fortifications ; but the wind suddenly shifting, and increasing to a gale, the commodore was compelled to return. On the 3d of August, he again approached to within two or three miles of the batteries. Having observed that several of the enemy's boats were stationed without the reef of rocks, covering the entrance of the har bour, he resolved to take advantage of this circum stance. He made signal for the squadron to come"], [44, "30 NAVAL TEMPLE. within speaking distance, to communicate to the several commanders his intention of attacking the shipping and batteries. The gun-boats and bomb- ketches were immediately manned, and prepared for action. The former were arranged in two divi- sions of three each. The first division was under the command of captain Somers, on board the boat No. 1 ; lieutenant James Decatur commanded the boat No. 2 ; and lieutenant Blake, No. 3. The second division was commanded by captain Deca- tur, in No. 4 ; lieutenant Bainbridge command- ed No. 5 ; and lieutenant Trippe No. 6. The two bomb-ketches were commanded, the one by lieutenant commandant Dent; the other by Mr. Robinson, first lieutenant of the commodore's ship. At half past one, the squadron stood in for the bat- teries. At two, the gun-boats were cast off. At half past two, signal was made for the bomb-ketches and gun-boats to advance and attack. At three quarters past two, the signal was given for a general action. It commenced by the bomb-ketches throw- ing shells into the town. A tremendous fire imme- diately commenced from the enemies batteries and vessels, of at least two hundred guns. It was im mediately returned by the American squadron, now within musket-shot of the principal batteries. At this moment, captain Decatur, with the three gun-boats under his command, attacked the enemy's eastern division, consisting of nine gun-boats. He was soon in the midst of them. The sue of the cannon"], [45, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 31 and musketry was immediately changed to a despe rate attack with bayonet, spear, sabre, &c. Captain Decatur having grappled a Tripolitan boat, and boarded her with only fifteen Americans; in ten minutes her decks were cleared, and she was cap tured. Three Americans were wounded. At this moment captain Decatur was informed that the gun boat commanded by his brother, had engaged and captured a boat belonging to the enemy; but that his brother, as he was stepping on board, was treacherously shot by the Tripolitan commander, who made off with his boat. Captain Decatur im mediately pursued the murderer, who was retreat ing within the lines ; having succeeded in coming along side, he boarded with only eleven men. A doubtful contest of twenty minutes ensued. Deca tur immediately attacked the Tripolitan comman der, who was armed with a spear and cutlass. In parrying the Turk's spear, Decatur broke his sword close to the hilt, and received a slight wound in the right arm and breast ; but having seized the spear he closed ; and, aster a violent struggle, both fell, Decatur uppermost. The Turk then drew a dag ger from his belt ; but Decatur caught hold of his arm, drew a pistol from his pocket, and shot him. While they were thus struggling, the crews of both vessels rushed to the assistance of their comman ders. And so desperate had the contest round them been, that it was with difficulty Decatur could ex tricate himself from the killed and wounded that had fallen around him. In this affair an American"], [46, "32 Naval temple. manifested the most heroick courage and attach ment to his commander. Decatur, in the struggle, was attacked in the rear by a Tripolitan ; who had aimed a blow at his head, which must have proved fatal, had not this generous-minded tar, then dan gerously wounded, and deprived of the use of both his hands, rushed between him and the sabre, the stroke of which he received in his head, whereby his skull was fractured. This hero, however, sur vived, and now receives a pension from his grateful country. AU the Americans but four were wound ed. Captain Decatur brought both his prizes safe to the American squadron. Lieutenant Trippe boarded one of the enemy's large boats, with only a midshipman, Mr. Jonathan Henly, and nine men ; his boat falling off before any more could join him. He was thus left either to perish, or to conquer thirty -six men, with only eleven. Though at first, the victory seemed doubt ful, yet, in a few minutes, the Tripolitans were sub dued ; fourteen of them were killed, and twenty two taken prisoners. Seven of these last were severely wounded. Lieutenant Trippe received eleven sabre wounds, some of them dangerous. The blade of his sword bending, he closed with his an tagonist. Both fell. In the struggle, Trippe wrested the Turk's sword from him, and, with it, stabbed him to the heart. Lieutenant Bainbridge had his lateen yards shot away. This rendered all his exertions to get along side the enemy's boats of no effect. But his"], [47, "33 naval temple. brisk and well directed fire, within musket shot, did great execution. At one time his boat grounded within pistol shot of one of the enemy's batteries. He was there exposed to the fire of musketry ; but, by his address and courage, he extricated himself from his dangerous situation. Captain Somers was not able to get far enough to windward, to co-operate with Decatur. He, how ever, bore down upon the leeward division of the enemy. With his single boat, he attacked five full manned Tripolitan boats, within pistol shot. He defeated, and drove them in a shattered condition, and with the loss of many lives, to take refuge under the rocks. The two bomb vessels kept their station, and threw a great many shells into the town. Five of the enemy's gun-boats, and two galleys, composing their centre division, stationed within the rocks, being reinforced, and all joined by the gun-boats that had been driven in, twice attempted to row out and surround the gun-boats and prizes of the Ame ricans. They were, however, prevented by the vigilance of the commodore, who made signal for the brigs and schooners to cover them. This was properly executed by these vessels. \"Their conduct was excellent during the whole of the engage ment, and they annoyed the enemy exceedingly. The fire from the Constitution did considerable execution, and kept the enemy's flotilla in constant disorder. She was several times within two cables' length of the rocks, and three of the batteries. As S"], [48, "34 NAVAL TEMPLE. soon as her broadside was brought to bear on any of the batteries, it was immediately silenced. But having no large vessels to secure these advantages, the fire was recommenced as soon as she changed her position. At half past four, the wind having inclined to the northward, and the enemy's flotilla having retreated to a station which covered them from the fire of the Americans, signal was made for the gun-boats and bombs to retire from the actiun. This was effect ed, and in fifteen minutes the squadron was out of the reach of the enemy's shot. The squadron was more than two hours within grape shot distance of the enemy's batteries, which kept up a constant fire. The damage sustained by the Americans was by no means proportionate to the apparent danger. The frigate Constitution was struck in her mainmast by a thirty-two pound ball, her sails and rigging were considerably cut, and one of her quarter-deck guns was injured by a round shot; not a man, however, was killed on board of her. The other vessels suf fered in their rigging, and had several men wound ed ; but none were killed, excepting lieutenant De catur. On the part of the enemy the effect of this engagement was very different. The boats cap tured by the Americans had one hundred and three men on board, forty-seven of whom were killed and twenty-six wounded. Three other boats were sunk with all the men on board of them. Numbers were also swept from the decks of the other vessels in the harbour. On shore, several Tripolitans were"], [49, "35 NAVAL TEMPLE. killed and wounded ; a number of guns in the bat teries were dismounted ; and the town was conside rably injured. When the squadron was standing in for the attack, the bashaw affected to despise them. After having surveyed them from his palace, he said, \" they will mark their distance for tacking ; they are a sort of Jews, who have no notion of fighting.\" The palace and terraces of the houses were crowded with spec tators to behold the chastisement the bashaw's boats would give the American vessels if they approach ed too near. Momentary, however, was this exul tation. Scarcely had the battle commenced, when no one was to be seen, except at the batteries. Many of the inhabitants fled to the country: and the bashaw retreated to his bomb-proof room. On the 5th of August the commodore prevailed on a French privateer, that had left Tripoli in the morning, to return with eleven wounded Tripoli tans, whose wounds had been carefully dressed. The commodore also sent a letter to the bashaw's minister. The prisoners informed the prince, that the Americans in battle were fiercer than lions, but in the treatment of their prisoners, they were even more kind than the mussulmen. The bashaw at first misunderstood the motive of sending these men ; but when informed that it was done through mo tives of humanity, he professed to be pleased, and said that if he took any wounded Americans, he should, in like manner, restore them : but he would not release any of the crew of the Philadelphia."], [50, "36 NAVAL TEMPLE. On the 7th the privateer returned with a letter from the French consul, signifying, that the bashaw would probably treat on more reasonable terms. Nothing, however, definitive or satisfactory was proposed. The terms intimated were considerably higher than the commodore felt willing, or thought himself authorized to accept. He therefore pre pared for a second attack. The bomb-ketches, commanded by lieutenants Crane and Thorn, were to take a station in a small bay west of the town, where, without being much exposed, they might throw their shells with great effect. The gun-boats were to attack a seven gun battery. The brigs and schooners were to support them, in case the enemy's flotilla should venture out. At half-past two, the action commenced. In the course of two hours, six of the seven guns in the battery were silenced. During the action, forty-eight shells and about five hundred round shot were thrown into the town and batteries. The Tripolitan galleys man\u0153uvred to gain a position that might enable them to cut off the retreat of the American gun-boats; but the large vessels defeated their design. One of the American prize boats, taken in the first attack, was blown up by a red-hot shot from the battery passing through her magazine. She had on board twenty eight men, ten of whom were killed, and six wound ed : among the former were James Caldwell, first lieutenant of the Siren, and J. Dorsey, midshipman. Mr. Spence, midshipman, and eleven men, were taken up unhurt. When the explosion took place"], [51, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 37 this young officer was superintending the loading of a gun ; having discharged the piece, he with the survivers jumped into the sea. They were soon taken up by another boat. At eight in the evening of the same day, the John Adams, captain Chauncy, joined the squad ron. By him the commodore was informed, that four frigates were on their passage ; also, that by the appointment of a senior officer to one of the frigates, he would be superseded in his command. The government was highly satisfied with the con duct of the commodore ; but had not a sufficient number of captains juniors to the commodore to supply all the frigates with commanders ; nor had information of his brilliant success as yet reached America. The John Adams having been sent out as a trans port, no assistance could, for the present, be received from her. All her guns were stowed by the kel son, and their carriages put away on board of the other frigates. As these last were all to sail four days after the John Adams, further operations were suspended in expectation of their arrival. On the 9th, the commodore reconnoitred the harbour, in the brig Argus. Next day a flag of truce was seen flying on the shore. The commo dore sent a boat, but which, however, was not per mitted to land her men. They returned with a let ter from the French consul. By it the commodore was informed that the bashaw would accept five hundred dollars for the ransom of each prisoner, and"], [52, "38 NAVAL TEMPLE. put an end to the war without any annuity for peace. The sum demanded amounted to about one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. This the com modore rejected ; but for the sake of the captives, and to prevent further effusion of blood, he offered eighty thousand dollars as ransom, and ten thou sand dollars as presents. The bashaw, however, suspended the negotiations, and said he would wait the result of another attack. On the night of the 23d, the bomb-ketches were sent under the protection of the gun-boats, to bom bard the town. The bombardment commenced at two a. m. and continued till daybreak; but without much effect. The weather being favourable on the 27th, the commodore stood in for Tripoli, and anchored the Constitution two miles n. by e. from fort English. The light vessels kept under way. Asa number of officers and seamen of the Constitution were em ployed in the boat, captain Chauncey, several of his officers, and about seventy seamen, volunteered their services on board her. The gun-boats, accompanied by the Siren, Ar gus, Vixen, Nautilus, Enterprize, and the boats of the squadron, anchored at three in the morning within pistol shot of the enemy's lines. With springs on their cables, they commenced a brisk fire on the shipping, town, batteries, and castle. It was warmly returned from the enemy's batteries. The boats of the squadron remained with the gun boats to assist in boarding the flotilla in case it"], [53, "39 NAVAL temple. should come out. The brigs and schooners kept under way, to harass the enemy, and to support the gun-boats. At daylight, the commodore, appre hensive that the ammunition of the gun-boats might be nearly expended, weighed anchor, and stood in under the direct fire of fort English, and of the cas tle, crown and mole batteries. He made signal for the gun-boats to retire from action. Having ar rived at a good distance for siring at thirteen Tripo litan gun-boats and galleys, engaged with the Ame rican boats, he dicharged a broadside of round and grape shot at them. One of them was sunk ; two were disabled; and the remainder put to flight. The commodore then continued running in until within musket shot of the batteries. He hove to, fired three hundred round shot, besides grape and cannister, into the bashaw's castle, town and bat teries. The castle and two of the batteries were silenced. A little after six he hauled off. The gun-boats fired four hundred round shot, besides grape and cannister, apparently with much effect. The result of this attack was serious on shore. A thirty-six pound ball penetrated the castle, and en tered the apartment of the prisoners. Considerable damage was done to the houses. Several lives were lost. A boat from the John Adams, with a master's mate and eight men on board, was sunk by a double headed shot, which killed three seamen and badly wounded another. The French consul, immediately after the attack, renewed the negotiations for peace. They were,"], [54, "40 NAVAL TEMPLE. however, broken off, in consequence, he thought, of one of the vessels of the squadron approaching the harbour as a cartel. This the bashaw inter preted as a proof of discouragement on the part of the Americans. On the 3d of September, the bomb-ketches being repaired, and also the damages sustained by the other vessels in the action of the 27th of August, the commodore resolved on another attack. The action commenced between three and four o'clock, and soon became general. As the American gun boats bore down, the boats and galleys gave way, and retreated under cover of the musketry, on shore. The brigs, schooners and gun-boats, pursued as far as the depth of the water would permit, and within musket shot of fort English. The action in this quarter was divided. The brigs and schooners, with one division of the gun-boats, engaged the fort. The other division continued engaged with the Tripolitan boats and galleys. The two bomb-ketches, while throwing their shells into the town, were exposed to a direct fire from the bashaw's castle, from the crown, mole, and several other batteries. The commodore, perceiv ing their danger, ran his ship between them and the batteries, within musket shot. Seventy guns were brought to bear on him from the batteries. But he discharged eleven broadsides with so much effect, that he silenced the principal batteries, and injured the others, and also the town considerably. The wind veering to the northward, and it beginning to"], [55, "41 WAV AL TEMPLE. blow fresh, the commodore, at half past four p. m. gave signal to retire from the action under cover of the Constitution. Though the frigates and vessels were much damaged in this engagement, not a man was lost. The bomb-vessel, commanded by lieutenant Ro binson, had all her shrouds shot away, and was so much damaged in her hull, as to be with difficulty kept above water. The Argus received a thirty two pound ball in her hull. It cut away a lower cable as it entered, which so completely destroyed its force, that it fell upon the deck without doing any injury. Commodore Preble had for some time contem plated sending a fire-ship into the harbour, in order to destroy the flotilla, and injure the town. Cap tain Somers volunteered his services. He, with the assistance of lieutenants Wadsworth and Israel, fit ted out the ketch Intrepid for the expedition. One hundred barrels of gunpowder and one hundred and fifty shells were placed in the hold. Fusee6 and combustibles were so applied as not to endanger a retreat. On Ihe evening of the 4th of September, captain Somers chose two fast-rowing boats, in order to bring off the people after the vessel should be set on fire. His own boat was manned by four men from the Nautilus and six from the Constitution, with lieutenant Wadsworth. At eight they parted from the squadron, and stood into the harbour. They were convoyed by the Argus, Vixen, and Nautilus, 6"], [56, "42 NAVAL TEMPLE. until arrived within a short distance from the bat teries. On entering the inner harbour, and near the point of her destination, the fire ship was board ed and carried by two galleys of one hundred men each. At this moment she exploded with the most awful effect. Every battery was silenced. Not a gun was fired during the remainder of the night. There is every reason to suppose that captain So mers, on perceiving no means of escape left, and that he should inevitably be doomed to an ignomin ious captivity, heroically resolved to die, and with his own hands set fire to the train, when himself, his companions, and the enemy, met a common death. After this, nothing material occurred until Sep tember 9th, when the long expected squadron, under commodore Barron, joined the one before Tripoli. Here ended the command of commodore Preble, so honourable to himself and his country. All joined in praising his distinguished merit. The Pope made a publick declaration, that \" the United States, though in their infancy, had, in this affair, done more to humble the antichristian barbarians on that coast, than all the European states had done for a long series of time.\" Sir Alexander Ball, a distin guished commander in the British navy, addressed commodore Preble as follows : \u2014 \" I beg to repeat my congratulations on the services you have render ed your country, and the hair-breadth escapes you have had in setting a distinguished example. Your bravery and enterprise are worthy a great and rising nation. If I were to offer my opinion, it should be*"], [57, "43 NAVAL TEMPLE. that you have done well not to purchase a peace with the enemy. A few brave men have indeed been sacrificed; but they could not have fallen in a better cause ; and I even conceive it advisable to risk more lives rather than submit to terms which might encourage the Barbary states to add fresh demands and insults.\" After the junction of the two squadrons, commo dore Preble obtained leave to return home. This he did with the greater pleasure, as it would give the command of a frigate to captain Decatur. On his return to the United States, he was received and treated every where with that distinguished atten tion, which he had so fully merited. Congress voted him their thanks, and requested the President to present him with an emblematical medal.* RENCOUNTER OF THE PRESIDENT AND LITTLE BELT. Pursuant to instructions from the navy depart ment, on the 10th of May, 1811, commodore Rod gers, commanding the frigate President, sailed from Annapolis for New York. On the 16th, about noon, and within six leagues from land, a sail was discovered to the eastward, standing towards the President. The commodore perceived it to be a man of war ; and supposed it to be the British fri gate Guerriere, which frigate, it was also supposed, * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 148\u2014163."], [58, "44 NAVAL TEMPLE. had, a few days before, impressed a boy from on board an American brig, near Sandy Hook. Com modore Rodgers, considering it his duty to know the names and character of all foreign vessels hover ing on the coast, resolved to speak to her. He also hoped, that, if she proved to be the, Guerriere, he might prevail on her commander to relinquish the young man. At half past three, the commodore perceived his ship to be gaining upon the chase, but the wind decreasing, he did not come up with her till it was too dark to discover her actual force ; nor could he discover to what nation she belonged, as she declined showing her colours. At fifteen or twenty minutes past seven, the chase took in her studding sails, and soon after hauled up her courses. She then hauled by the wind on the starboard tack ; and, at the same time, hoisted an ensign or flag at her mizzen peak. It was, however, too dark to dis cover what nation it represented. Her broadside was now for the first time presented to view. Though her appearance indicated a frigate, dark ness prevented her actual force being ascertained. At twenty minutes past eight, the President being a little forward of the weather beam of the chase, and distant between seventy and a hundred yards from her, the commodore hailed, \" What ship is that?\" To this no answer was given; but the question was repeated from on board the chase. After a short pause, the question was repeated by the commodore, and immediately a shot was fired into the President. Just as the commodore was"], [59, "45 NAVAL TEMPLE. about giving orders for a shot to be fired in return, one was actually fired from the second division of the President. This was returned from the other vessel, by three guns in quick succession, and, soon after, by the remainder of his broadside and mus ketry. The commodore then gave a general order to fire. The fire from the President having, in a few minutes, produced a partial silence of the guns of the other vessel, the commodore gave orders to cease firing, judging that she must be a ship of very inferiour force, or that some untoward accident had happened to her. This order commodore Rodgers soon had reason to regret. The fire was renewed from the other vessel, and two of its thirty-two pound shot cut off one of the fore shrouds, and injured the fore-mast of the President. He therefore immedi ately ordered a recommencement of the fire. It continued for a few minutes, when the commodore, perceiving his opponent's gaff and colours down, his main-top-sail yard upon the cap, and his fire si lenced, again ordered the firing to cease, to prevent a further effusion of blood. After a short pause, perceiving his adversary was not disposed to renew the action, the commodore again hailed, and was informed that she was a British ship ; but, from the wind blowing fresh, he was unable to learn her name. Commodore Rodgers, having informed the Brit ish commander of the name of his ship, gave orders to wear ; to run under the lee of the British ship ; to haul by the wind on the starboard tack ; to heave"], [60, "46 NAVAL TEMPLE. to under top-sails ; and repair the little damage that had been sustained in the rigging. The President continued lying to all night on different tacks, with lights displayed, that the Bri tish vessel might better discern her position, and command any assistance that she might require dur ing the night. At day light she was discovered several miles to leeward. The commodore gave orders to bear up and run down to her under easy sail. After hailing her, he sent a boat on board, with lieutenant Creighton, to learn the name of the ship and her commander, with instructions to ascertain the damage she had sustained, and to state how much he regretted, on his part, the necessity that led to so unhappy a result, and to offer every as sistance in his power, in repairing the damages. Lieutenant Creighton returned with information that the vessel was his Britannick majesty's ship Little Belt, captain Bingham, of eighteen guns ; and that the captain declined accepting any assistance. The Little Belt had nine men killed and twenty-two wounded. No one was killed on board the Presi dent, and only a boy wounded. Captain Bingham's account differs materially from the preceding statement. He denies having fired the first gun ; asserts that the action lasted three quarters of an hour; and even intimates that he had gained the_ advantage in the contest. Commodore Rodgers's account, from which the one here given is taken, was confirmed by all his officers and crew, \u2022<m their solemn oath, before a court of inquiry."], [61, "47 NAVAL TEMPLE. The court also confirmed all the particulars of his statement, after a long and minute investigation.* THE PRESIDENT AND BELVIDERE. A formal declaration of war against Great Bri tain was passed by Congress on the 18th of June, 1812, which was proclaimed by the President of the United States on the following day. On the 21 st, Commodore Rodgers, having received official in formation of the event, set sail from New York, accompanied by the frigates United States and Congress, and the brigs Hornet and Argus, in search of a British fleet of merchantmen, which had sailed from Jamaica the preceding month. The follow ing night information was received of the convoy from an American brig, which had passed them four days before, and the squadron crowded all sail in pursuit. The next morning, however, their course was altered by the appearance of the British frigate Belvidere, to which the commodore immediately gave chase. The pursuit continued from six in the morning, till past four in the afternoon, when the President, having got within gun-shot, commenced a fire with the bow chase guns at the spars and rig ging of the Belvidere, in hopes of crippsing her so sa to enable them to get along side. The Belvi dere returned the fire of the President with her * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 168."], [62, "48 NAVAL TEMPLE. stern guns, and the firing was kept up without inter mission for about ten minutes, when one of the President's chase guns burst, by which unfortunate accident sixteen men were killed and wounded; among the wounded was commodore Rodgers, who had his leg fractured. By the bursting of the gun, and the explosion of the passing box, from which it was served with powder, both the main and fore castle decks were so much shattered as to prevent the use of a chase gun on that side for some time. Orders were therefore given to veer the ship, and a broadside was fired in the hope of disabling the spars of the enemy; but this did not succeed. Considerable damage, however, was done to the rig ging and the stern. The utmost exertion was now used on board the President, by wetting the sails, &e. to gain ground of her opponent ; but without success. A constant firing was kept up from both ships, until about seven o'clock ; when the Belvi dere, having cut away her anchors, started a num ber of water casks, and thrown overboard her boats and every thing that could be spared, got out of the reach of the President's shot. The chase was continued till about midnight, when it was given up as hopeless. One of the first shots fired by the President killed one man and wounded six on board the Belvidere ; and the captain was severe ly wounded in the thigh by the breaking of the breeching of a carronade. On board the President there were three killed and nineteen wounded, the greater part by the bursting of the gun as above related."], [63, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 49 ESCAPE OF THE CONSTITUTION. The frigate Constitution, commanded by captain Isaac Hull, had received orders to join the squadron (under commodore Rodgers,) and, for that purpose, sailed from Annapolis on the 5th of J uly. On the 1 7th, off Egg Harbour, four ships, apparently men of war, were discovered from the mast-head to the northward, and in shore of the Constitution ; and, in the belief that it was the American squadron, wait ing her arrival, all sail was made in chase of them. At four in the afternoon, another ship was seen to the northeast, standing for the Constitution, with all sail set. At ten in the evening, being then within six or eight miles of the strange sail, the private signal was made by the Constitution; which not being answered, it was concluded that she, and the ships in shore, were enemy's vessels. Captain Hull immediately laid his vessel in the same course with the others, having determined to lie off till daylight to see what they were. Next morning, two frigates were seen from the Constitution, under her lee, one frigate four or five miles, and a line of battle ship, a frigate, a brig, and a schooner, ten or twelve miles directly astern, all in chase, and coming up fast, they having a fine breeze, and it being nearly calm where the Consti tution was. Finding there was but little chance for escape, being then within five miles of three heavy frigates, the Constitution was cleared for action, and 7"], [64, "50 NAVAL TEMPLE. two guns were run out at the cabin windows and two at the ports on the quarterdeck. At eight o'clock, four of the ships were nearly within gun shot, some of them having six or eight boats ahead, towing with all their oars and sweeps out. In this perilous situation a new expedient was adopted, which was the means of saving the vessel. Being in only twenty-four fathoms water, boats were sent out ahead with anchors, and the ship warped up to them, by which they soon began to get ahead of the enemy. They, however, adopted the same plan, and all the boats from the most dis tant ships were sent to assist those which were nearest. For two days and nights the Constitution was thus chased by the British squadron, sometimes with light winds, at others, warping and towing in a calm, seldom much beyond gun-shot distance. On the morning of the 20th, only three of the squadron could be seen from the mast-head, the nearest about twelve miles distant, directly astern. A light breeze now springing up, the enemy was soon left far behind, and the Constitution, not being able to find the American squadron, arrived safe at Boston. During the whole of the chase the gallant crew of the Constitution remained at their stations. It is related on good authority, that the officers of the British ships expressed their admiration of the skill with which captain Hull man\u0153uvred his ship and effected his escape. But however brilliantly the nautical knowledge and professional adroitness of captain Hull were"], [65, "51 NAVAL TEMPLE. displayed on that occasion, his generous disinterest edness afterwards, is worthy of universal applause and imitation. The publick notice taken of the affair, and the praises bestowed on the commander, induced him, on his arrival at Boston, to insert the following card on the books of the Exchange Cof fee House. \" Captain Hull, finding that his friends in Boston are correctly informed of his situation, when chased by the British squadron off New York, and that they are good enough to give him more credit for having escaped it than he ought to claim, takes this opportunity of requesting them to transfer their good wishes to lieutenant Morris and the other brave officers, and the crew under his command, for their very great exertions and prompt attention to his orders while the enemy were in chase. Captain Hull has great pleasure in saying, that, notwith standing the length of the chase, and the officers and crew being deprived of sleep, and allowed but little refreshment during the time, not a murmur was heard to escape them.\" CAPTURE OF THE GUERRIERE. On the second day of August, the Constitution again set sail, pursuing an easterly course. She passed near the coast as far down as the Bay of Fundy ; then ran off Halifax and Cape Sable ; and"], [66, "52 NAVAL TEMPLE. not seeing any vessels for some days, captain Hull steered toward Newfoundland, passed the Isle of Sables, and took a station off the Gulf of St. Law rence, to intercept the Canada trade. While cruis ing here, he captured two merchant vessels. On the 1 5th, he chased a convoy of five sail, captured one of them, and prevented the prize ship of an American privateer from being retaken. Having received information that the British squadron were off the Grand Bank, and not far distant, he changed his cruising ground, and stood to the southward. On the memorable 19th of August, at two p. M. the Constitution being in latitude forty-one degrees and forty-two minutes north, and fifty-five degrees and thirty-three minutes west longitude, a vessel was discovered to the southward. The Constitu tion instantly made all sail in chase, and soon gained on her. At three p. m. it could plainly be perceived she was a ship, on the starboard tack, under easy sail, close hauled to the wind. At half past three, she was ascertained to be a frigate. The Constitu tion continued the chase. At about three miles dis tance, captain Hull ordered the light sails to be taken in, the courses to be hauled up, and the ship to be cleared for action. The chase now backed her main-top-sail, and waited for the Constitution to come down. As soon as the Constitution was ready for action, she bore down, intending to bring imme diately to close action the British frigate, which had about this time hoisted three English ensigns in token of defiance. As soon as the Constitution"], [67, "53 NAVAL TEMPLE. came within gun-shot, the British frigate fired her broadside ; then filled away, wore, and gave a broad side on the other tack. They however, produced no effect ; her shot fell short. The British frigate man\u0153uvred and wore several times for about three quarters of an hour, in order to obtain a raking position. But not succeeding in this, she bore up under her top-sails and jib with the wind on the quarter. Captain Hull immediately made sail to bring his ship up with her. At five minutes before six, P. m. the Constitution being along side, within pistol-shot, he ordered a brisk firing to be com menced from all her guns, which were double-shot ted with round and grape shot ; and so well directed and so warmly kept up was the American fire, that, in fifteen minutes, the mizzen-mast of the British frigate went by the board, and her main-yard in her slings. Her hull was much injured; and her rig ging and sails torn to pieces. The fire was kept up, in the same spirited manner, for fifteen minutes longer, by the Constitution. She had now taken a position for raking, on the bows of the British fri gate ; when the latter could only bring her bow guns to bear on the Constitution. The grape-shot and small arms of the Constitution completely swept the decks of the British frigate. Thirty minutes after the commencement of the action by the Con stitution, the mainmast and foremast of the British frigate went by the board, taking with them every spar except the bowsprit. She then struck her colours, which had been fastened to the stump of"], [68, "54 NAVAL TEMPLE. the mizzen-mast. The Constitution then set fore and main-sails, and hauled to the eastward to repair damages. All her braces, a great part of her stand ing and running rigging, and some of her spars, were shot away. At seven, p. m. she stood under the lee of the prize, and sent a boat on board, which return ed at eight with captain Dacres, commander of the frigate. She was the Guerriere, rating thirty-eight, and mounting forty-nine guns. The hull of the Gnerriere was so much shattered, that a few more broadsides would have sunk her. She had fifteen men killed, sixty-one wounded, and twenty-four missing, who, it is presumed, were swept overboard by the falling masts. The Constitution had only seven killed, and seven wounded. The boats were immediately employed in bring ing the wounded and prisoners on board the Consti tution. About two, a. m. a sail was discovered off the larboard beam, standing to the south. The ship was instantly cleared for action. At three, the vessel stood away. At daybreak, information was received from the lieutenant on board the prize, that the ship was in a sinking condition, and had four feet water in the hold. As soon as all her crew were removed from on board of her, she was set on fire, and blew up a quarter past three. Captain Hull, in his letter to the secretary of the navy, says :\u2014 \" that, from the smallest boy in the ship, to the oldest seaman, not a look of fear was seen. They all went into action giving three cheers, and requesting to be laid along-side the enemy.\"* * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 175, 176."], [69, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 55 In the heat of the engagement, one of the crew of the Constitution, perceiving the flag at the fore too-mast head had been shot away, went up with it, and lashed it so securely, as to render it impossible to shoot it away, unless the mast went with it. The generosity of captain Hull and his crew was equal to their bravery. Captain Dacres, in his official letter, confesses their conduct to have been \"that of a brave enemy ; the greatest care being taken to prevent the men losing the slightest article, and the greatest attention being paid to the wounded.\" The Constitution arrived in Boston harbour the 30th day of August. When captain Hull landed, he was received with every demonstration of affec tion and respect. The Washington Artillery, post ed on the wharf, welcomed him with a federal salute, which Avas returned from the Constitution. An im mense assemblage of citizens made the air ring with loud and unanimous huzzas, which were repeated on his passage up State Street to the Exchange Coffee House. The street was beautifully deco rated with American flags. A splendid entertainment was given to captain Hull and his officers by the citizens of Boston, at which commodore Rodgers and the officers of his squadron were invited. The citizens of Philadel phia subscribed for two elegant pieces of plate \u2014 one to be presented to captain Hull, and the other to Mr. Charles Morris, his first lieutenant. The legislature of New York, the council of the cities"], [70, "56 NAVAL TEMPLE. of Albany and Savannah, the Congress of the Unit ed States, the house of representatives of Massa chusetts, and other publick bodies, voted their thanks to captain Hull, his officers and crew. The order of Cincinnati admitted him as an hon ourary member. Congress voted fifty thousand dollars as an indemnification to the captain, officers, and crew, for the loss sustained by the destruction of the Guerriere. CAPTAIN PORTER.\u2014 FIRST CRUISE OF THE ESSEX. The Essex, commanded by captain David Porter, sailed from New York the third of July, 1812, and shortly after fell in with a fleet of transports, under convoy of a frigate and two bomb-ketches, from Jamaica for Halifax, with troops. The Essex kept at a distance until night, when she cut off a brig with one hundred and fifty soldiers on board, which was ransomed for a bill of exchange on London for fourteen thousand dollars. The men were disarm ed, and an exchange receipt taken for them, and they severally took an oath not to serve until ex changed. The following day captain Porter captured the brig Lamprey from Jamaica, by which he re ceived intelligence that the Thetis frigate, with specie and a large convoy was about sailing for"], [71, "57 NAVAL TEMPLE. England. Every exertion was made to get oft* St. Augustine in time to fall in with them, but without effect, as fresh gales prevailed from the southwest, which increased till the 19th of July, when, by the violence of the tempest, they were compelled to run before the wind. On the 1 3th of August, the British sloop of war Alert, of twenty guns, ran down on the weather quarter of the Essex. Her crew gave three cheers, and immediately commenced an engagement. But so spirited and well directed a fire was kept up from the Essex, that in eight minutes after the com mencement of the action, she forced the Alert to strike her colours.. She had seven feet water in her hold. She was much cut to pieces, and had three men wounded. The Essex did not receive the slightest injury- Captain Porter, being much embarrassed by the number of his prisoners, amounting to about five hundred, concluded an arrangement with the cap tain of the Alert for sending them to a British port, in the Alert, as a cartel. The Alert, on her return to the United States, was fitted out as a government vessel. On the 30th of August, the Essex being in lati tude 36 n. longitude 62 w. a British frigate was discovered standing towards her, under a press of sail. Captain Porter stood for her under easy sail, with his ship prepared for action ; and appre hensive that she might not find the Essex during the night, he hoisted a light. At nine the British ves- 8"], [72, "58 NAVAL TEMPLE. sel made a signal. It consisted of two flashes and a blue light. She was then apparently about four miles distant. Captain Porter stood for the point where she was seen, until midnight, when perceiving nothing of her, he concluded it would be best to heave-to for her, until morning, concluding she had done the same. But to his great surprise, and the mortification of his officers and crew, she was no longer in sight. Captain Porter believed it to be not unlikely, that this vessel was the Acasta, of fifty guns, sent out, accompanied by the Ring Dove, of twenty-two, to cruise for the Essex. On the 4th of September, the Essex being off the tail of St. George's Bank, two ships of war were discovered to the southward, and a brig to the northward. The brig was in chase of an American merchant ship. Captain Porter immediately chased the brig, which attempted to pass, and join the rest of the squadron. This he prevented, and compelled her to stand to the northward. He continued in chase of her, until abreast of the American ship, when the wind becoming light, she escaped by means of her sweeps. On shewing American colours, several signal guns were fired by the ships to the southward. All sail was made bv them in chase. At four p. m. they had gained the wake of the Essex, and were coming up with her very fast. Calculating on making his escape by some man\u0153uvre during the night, he fired a gun to windward. The two ships still continued to gain on the Essex. The largest was considerably to windward of the other, and about"], [73, "59 NAVAL TEMPLE. five miles astern of the Essex. Captain Porter de termined to heave about as soon as it grew dark, and, in case he should not. be able to pass her, he determined to fire a broadside into her, and lay her on board. The crew, as soon as the plan was pro posed to them, gave three cheers, and were in high spirits. Twenty minutes after seven, the Essex hove about, and stood s. e. by s. until thirty minutes after eight, when she bore away s. w. without see ing any thing more of them. This was the more surprising, as a pistol was fired on board the Essex when nearest to them. The Essex arrived safe in the Delaware a few days after. WASP AND FROLIC. Of all the victories achieved by single vessels, perhaps the most brilliant, and which will probably long stand on record without a parallel, is that of the Wasp, commanded by captain Jacob Jones, over the sloop of war Frolic. On the 1 3th of October, captain Jones left the Delaware bay in the Wasp, on a cruise. On the 16th, she experienced a heavy gale, in which she lost her jib-boom and two men. On the evening of the next day, about eleven o'clock, being in the track of vessels passing from Bermuda to Halifax, she found herself near five strange sail, steering"], [74, "60 NAVAL TEMPLE. eastward. Some of them appearing to be ships of war, it was thought better to get farther from them. The Wasp, therefore, hauled her wind, and having reached a few miles to windward, so as to escape or fight, as occasion might require, followed the strange sail through the night. At daybreak, on Sunday morning, captain Jones found that they were six large merchant ships, under convoy of a sloop of war, from Honduras to England. Four of the ships were large and well manned, mounting from sixteen to eighteen guns, and having from forty to fifty men each. Captain Jones, however, deter mined to attack them. The convoy made their escape under a press of sail. The sloop of war alone remained, which proved to be the Frolic, cap tain Whinyates, mounting twenty-two guns, and having a crew of about one hundred and twenty men. There was a heavy swell in the sea, and the weather was boisterous. The top-gallant yards of the Wasp were taken down, her top-sails were close reefed, and she was prepared for action. About eleven o'clock the Frolic showed Spa nish colours. The Wasp immediately displayed the American ensign and pendant ; and at thirty two minutes past eleven, came down to windward on the larboard side of the Frolic. When within about sixty yards she hailed. The Frolic then hauled down her Spanish colours ; hoisted the British ensign ; and opened a fire of cannon and musketry. This was instantly returned by the Wasp; and, nearing the enemy, the action became close and"], [75, "61 NAVAL TEMPLE. spirited. About four or five minutes after the com mencement of the action, the main-top-mast of the Wasp was shot away, and, having fallen, with the main-top-sail yard, across the larboard, fore, and fore top-sail braces, rendered her head yards unmanage able during the remainder of the engagement. In two or three minutes more, her gaff and mizzen-top gallant-sail were shot away. She however kept up a close and constant fire. The sea was so rough, that the muzzles of the Wasp's guns were frequent ly under water. The Americans fired as the side of their ship was going down. Their shot, of course, either struck the Frolic's deck,' or below it. The English fired as their vessel rose. Their balls con sequently only struck the rigging, or were ineffec tual. The Wasp, having now shot ahead of the Frolic, poured a broadside into her, which com pletely raked her. She then took a position on the Frolic's larboard bow. A most spirited fire was now kept up from the Wasp, which produced great effect. The fire of the Frolic had slackened so much, that captain Jones gave up his intention of boarding her, lest both vessels might be endangered by the roughness of the sea. But, in the course of a few minutes more, not a brace of the Wasp was left. All had been shot away. Her rigging was so much torn to pieces, that captain Jones was afraid, that her masts, being unsupported, would go by the board ; and the Frolic thereby be enabled to escape. He therefore resolved to board, and at once decide the contest. With this intention, he wore ship, and"], [76, "62 NAVAL TEMPLE. ran down upon the enemy. The vessels struck each other. The Wasp's side rubbed along the Frolic's bow. The jib-boom of the latter entered between the main and mizzen rigging of the Wasp, directly over the heads of captain Jones and his first lieuten ant, Biddle, who were then standing together near the capstan. The Frolic now lay in so good a po sition for being raked, that it was resolved not to board until another broadside had been poured into her. So near were the two vessels, that while the men were loading the guns, the rammers of the Wasp were pushed against the Frolic's sides ; and two of her guns went through the bow ports of the Frolic, and swept the whole length of her deck. About this time, Jack Lang, a brave and intrepid seaman, of the Wasp, and who had once been im pressed on board a man of war, jumped on a gun with his cutlass, and was springing on board the Frolic ; when captain Jones, desiring to fire again before boarding, called him down. But, probably urged on by his impetuosity, he did not hear the command of his captain, and was immediately on the bowsprit of the Frolic. Lieutenant Biddle, per ceiving the ardour and enthusiasm of the Wasp's crew, mounted on the hammock-cloth to board. The crew immediately followed. But the lieuten ant's feet being entangled in the rigging of the Frolic's bowsprit, and midshipman Baker, in his ardour to board, laying hold of his coat, he fell back on the Wasp's deck. He directly sprang up, and, as the next swell of the sea brought the Frolic"], [77, "63 NAVAL TEMPLE. nearer, he got on her bowsprit, where Lang and another seaman were already. He passed them on the forecastle ; and was much surprised at not see ing a single man alive on the Frolic's deck, except the seaman at the wheel, and three officers. The deck was slippery with blood, and strewed with dead bodies. As he went forward, the captain of the Frolick, and two other officers, who were stand ing on the quarter-deck, threw down their swords, and made an inclination of their bodies, as a sign of submission. The colours of the Frolic were still flying. None of her seamen, probably, dared to go into the rigging, to strike them, for fear of the mus ketry of the Wasp. Lieutenant Biddle himself immediately jumped into the rigging, and hauled down the British ensign. Possession was taken of the Frolic forty-three minutes after the commence ment of the action. She presented a most shocking spectacle. Her birth-deck was crowded with dead, wounded, and dying. Not above twenty of her crew escaped unhurt. Captain Jones immediately sent his surgeon's mate on board. All the blankets of the Frolic were brought from her slop-room for the accommodation of the Avounded. To increase the confusion, both the Frolic's masts fell, soon after taking possession of her, and covered the dead and every thing on deck. In this action, the crews of the vessels were about equal. The British vessel mounted four guns more than the American. The destruction on board of the Frolic could not be exactly determined ; but."], [78, "64 NAVAL TEMPLE. from the observations of the American officers, and the declarations of the English, there could not have been less than thirty killed, and about fifty wound ed. The Wasp had only five men killed, and five wounded. Lieutenant Biddle was placed on board the Frolic. A suspicious sail being perceived to windward, Captain Jones ordered him to proceed to Charles ton, or any other southern port in the United States. The Wasp intended to continue her cruise. The ships then parted. The suspicious sail bore down very fast. It was at first supposed she was one of the convoy. The Wasp was immediately cleared for action. As she approached, she proved to be a seventy-four, the Poictiers, captain Beresford. She fired a shot over the Frolic ; and, having passed her, overtook the Wasp, the disabled state of whose rigging prevented her from escaping. After she was taken possession of, the Poictiers returned to secure the Frolic. Both vessels were carried into Bermuda. This action completely demonstrated the supe rior skill and spirit of the American naval officers and seamen. The superiority of force certainly was on the side of the British. On the return of captain Jones to the United States, his gallant conduct was not passed unnoticed by his grateful countrymen. The Congress of the United States voted him and his crew twenty-five thousand dollars, in consideration of the loss they sustained by the recapture of the Frolic, also their"], [79, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 65 thanks. They ordered a gold medal to be pre sented to the captain, and a silver one to each of his officers. This gallant exploit deservedly secured to cap tain Jones and his brave crew, the acknowledgments of their grateful countrymen. The narrow limits of our work, forbid our entering into detail. We shall therefore merely state that pieces of plate, and swords were ordered for captain Jones, and thanks voted to him and his crew, by the legislature of Pennsylvania \u2014 the legislature of the state of Dela ware \u2014 the legislature of New York \u2014 the house of representatives of Massachusetts \u2014 the citizens of Philadelphia, \u2014 the common council of New York, &c. The order of Cincinnati at New York admitted captain Jones into the Society as an honourary member. Captain Jones, in consideration of his merit, was appointed to command the Macedonian, a thirty eight gun frigate, just captured from the British. Lieutenant Biddle was promoted to the rank of master commandant.* SECOND CRUISE OF COMMODORE RODGERS. On the 8th of October, commodore Rodgers sailed again from Boston, in the frigate President, * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 183\u2014186. 9"], [80, "66 NAVAL TEMPLE. accompanied by the United States, Congress, and Argus. On the 1 3th, the United States and Argus parted from the others in a gale of wind. On the 15th, the President and Congress captured the Brit ish packet Swallow, having on board specie amount ing to nearly two hundred thousand dollars. On the 31st they captured a South Sea ship, loaded with oil, one of two ships under convoy of the Galatea frigate, to which they gave chase, but lost her in a fog. During the remainder of the cruise, they saw no other British vessel except the frigate Nymph, which escaped in the night. On the 31st of December they arrived at Boston, having been as far to the east as longitude 22, and to the south as far as latitude 17 north. From longitude 22, they ran down the trade wind to longitude 50, and passed to the north, one hundred and fifty miles from Bermuda. In this cruise, the space passed over was not less than eight thousand miles ; and though the President and Congress returned richly laden, their commanders could not but regret that no opportunity was afforded to try the spirit and discipline of their officers and crews. The cash taken from the Swallow was carried from the navy yard to one of the banks, in several waggons, es corted by the crews of the frigates and a detach ment of marines, with drums beating and colours flying, amidst the huzzas of a large concourse of spectators. The specie and gold dust deposited in the bank were said to be worth nearly three hun dred thousand dollars."], [81, "67 NAVAL TEMPLE. THE ARGUS. After parting from the squadron, as above noted, the Argus, commanded by captain Sinclair, proceeded to the coast of Brazil, sailed along the north coast, from cape St. Roque to Surinam, thence to the windward of the West Indies, and in every direction between the Bermudas, Halifax, and the continent. After a cruise of ninety-six days, she arrived at New York, having made five prizes, valued at two hundred thousand dollars. She fell in with a British squadron of six sail, two of which were of the line, and one of them a remark ably fast sailer. The chase was continued for three days and nights, and under various circum stances, but, by unremitted exertions, the Argus eluded the pursuit. Pressed on all sides by the number of the enemy, and often baffled by the un settled state of the weather, she was at one time within gunshot of a seventy-four, and at another nearly surrounded. While in this perilous situa tion, she actually captured and manned one of her prizes. UNITED STATES AND MACEDONIAN. On the 25th of October, after being separated from the squadron, the United States, commanded by commodore Decatur, fell in with and captured,"], [82, "68 NAVAL TEMPLE. off the Western Isles, after an action of an hour and a half, the British frigate Macedonian, captain Carden, mounting forty-nine guns, and carrying three hundred and six men. The Macedonian being to windward, had the advantage of choosing her distance, which was so great, that for the first half hour, the United States could not use her car- ronades ; and at no time, were they within mus- ket or grape shot. To this circumstance, and a heavy swell of the sea, was ascribed the extreme length of the action. In this contest the superiority of the American gunnery was strikingly obvious. The Macedonian had one hundred and six men killed and wounded. She was totally dismasted, and had nearly one hundred shot holes in her hull. On board the United States there were only five killed and seven wounded ; and so little injury was done to the ship, that, in five minutes after the action, she was fully prepared for another. Shortly after the action commenced, such a torrent of fire proceeded from the United States, that the crew of the Macedonian supposed she was actually on fire, and gave three cheers. The Macedonian wTas a frigate of the largest class, only two years old, four months out of dock, and reputed one of the fastest sailers in the British service. All the private property of the officers and crew of the Macedonian was given up to them; that claimed by captain Carden, amounted to eight hun dred dollars, and was paid for by the commodore."], [83, "69 NAVAL TEMPLE. An instance of the generosity, which is so pre dominant in the breasts of American tars, must not be omitted. John Archibald, one of the crew of the United States, received a mortal wound, of which he soon after died. He left three children to the mercy of the world and a profligate mother, who had deserted them. When the father of Ar chibald went on board the frigate, to claim the wages and property of his son, an inquiry was made into the circumstances of his family. A plan was immediately agreed upon by the seamen for the relief of the orphans. Two dollars was subscribed by each of them ; a sum of eight hundred dollars was made up, and placed in the hands of suitable trustees, for the maintenance and education of his children. Commodore Decatur arrived at New London with his prize on the 4th of December. He re ceived from all quarters the congratulations of his countrymen. A gold medal was presented to him by Congress, in testimony of their high sense of his gallantry, good conduct and services. The legis lature of Pennsylvania voted him their thanks, and an elegant sword ; and various other testimonials of publick regard were bestowed upon him and his crew. The news of this brilliant victoiy was received at Washington on the evening of the 8th of Decem ber. It happened, that on that evening, a ball was given in compliment to the officers and navy gene rally, and particularly to captain Stewart, in ac-"], [84, "70 NAVAL TEMPLE. knowledgement of his politeness to the citizens of Washington on a recent occasion. A large and respectable company was assembled, and the scene was graced by the presence of all the beauty and fashion of the city. The room in which the com- pany were assembled had been decorated with the trophies of naval victory : The colours of the Guerrierc and Alert, displayed on the walls, roused the feelings of patriotism, and revived in the mind the recollection of the bravery which had won them. At this time lieutenant Hamilton arrived with the colours of the Macedonian, and despatches from commodore Decatur. He was received with loud acclamations, and escorted to the festive hall ; and the colours of the Macedonian were borne into the room by captains Hull and Stewart, and depo sited with those of the Guerriere and Alert. CONSTITUTION AND JAVA. On the arrival of the Constitution in Boston, after the capture of the Guerriere, captain Hull received permission to remain on shore to attend to bis private affairs, and commodore Bainbridge was appointed to command in his room. After undergo in g the necessary repairs, she sailed on a cruise along the coast of South America, accompanied by the Hor net sloop of war, commanded by captain Lawrence. In running down the coast of the Brazils, they"], [85, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 71 found the Bonne Citoyenne, a British ship of war, loaded with specie lying in the port of St. Salvador. Commodore Bainbridge here separated from cap tain Lawrence, leaving him to blockade the Bonne Citoyenne. On the twentv-ninth of December, the Consti tution, being in 1 3 degrees south latitude, and 38 west longitude, about ten leagues from the coast of Brazil, at nine a. m. two strange vessels were dis covered on her weather bow. At ten they were discovered to be ships. One of them stood in for the land; the other stood off shore towards the Constitution. At ten commodore Bainbridge tack ed ship to the northward and westward, and stood for the sail approaching him. At eleven a. m. he tacked to the southward and eastward, hauled up the mainsail, and took in the royals. At thirty minutes past eleven, made a private signal for the day, which was not answered ; and then set mainsail and royals, to draw the strange vessel off from the neu tral coast, and separate her from her company. At twelve, the American ensign and pendant were hoisted on board the Constitution. At fifteen minutes past twelve, the strange vessel hoisted an English ensign, and displayed a signal at her main mast. At a quarter past one, the ship in sight proving to be an English frigate, and being sufficiently dis tant from land, commodore Bainbridge ordered the mainsails and royals to be taken in, to tack ship and \u25a0'land for the enemv ; who soon bore down with an"], [86, "72 NAVAL TEMPLE. intention of raking .the Constitution, which she avoided by wearing. At two o'clock, p. m. the British ship was within half a mile of the Constitu tion, and to windward. She now hauled down her colours, except an union jack at the mizzen-mast head. This induced commodore Bainbridge to order a gun to be fired ahead of her, to make her show her colours. It was succeeded by the whole of the Constitution's broadside. On this, the enemy immediately hoisted colours, and returned the fire. A general action now commenced with round and grape shot. The British frigate kept at a much greater distance than the commodore wished. He, however, could not bring her to closer action, with out exposing his vessel to be several times raked. Both vessels for some time man\u0153uvred to obtain a position that would enable them to rake, or avoid being raked. In the early part of the engagement the wheel of the Constitution was shot away. Com modore Bainbridge determined to close with the British vessel, notwithstanding, in so doing, he should expose his ship to be several times raked. He or dered the fore and mainsails to be set, and luffed up close to the enemy, in such a manner that his jib boom got foul of the Constitution's mizzen rigging. About three o'clock, the head of the British vessel's bowsprit and jib-boom, were shot away ; and, in the space of an hour, her foremast was shot away by the board, her main-top-mast just above the cap, her gaff and spanker-boom, and her mainmast nearly by the board."], [87, "73 NAVAL TEMPLE. About four o'clock, the fire of the British vessel being completely silenced, and her colours in the main rigging being down, she was supposed to have struck. The courses of the Constitution were now hauled on board, to shoot ahead, in order to repair her rigging, which was very much cut. The Brit ish vessel was left a complete wreck. Her flag was soon after discovered to be still flying. The Constitution, however, hove to, to repair some of her damages. About a quarter of an hour after, the mainmast of the British vessel went by the board. About three quarters of an hour after four, the Constitution wore, and stood for the British ves sel ; and got close to her athwart her bows, in a very effectual position for raking, when she pru dently struck her flag. Had she suffered the broad side to have raked her, her additional loss would have been extremely great ; for she lay quite an unmanageable wreck upon the water. After the British frigate struck, the Constitutiop wore and reefed topsails. One of the only two re maining boats out of eight, was then hoisted out, and lieutenant Parker, of the Constitution, was sent to take possession of the frigate. She proved to be his Britannick majesty's frigate Java, rating thirty eight, but carrying forty-nine guns. She was man ned by upwards of four hundred men, ; and wa\u00a7 commanded by captain Lambert, a very distinguish ed naval officer. He was mortally wounded. The action continued, from the time the firing cora- 10"], [88, "74 NAVAL TEMPLE. menced till the time it ceased, one hour and fifty five minutes. The Constitution had nine men killed, and twen ty-five wounded. The Java had sixty killed, and one hundred and one (certainly) wounded \u2014 but by a letter written on board the Constitution, by one of the officers of the Java, and accidentally found, it is evident her loss must have been much greater. He states it to have been sixty killed, and one hundred and seventy wounded. The Java had her own full complement of men, and upwards of one hundred supernumeraries, for British ships in the East Indies. Her force in num ber of men, at the commencement of the action, was probably much greater than the officers of the Constitution were enabled to ascertain. Her offi cers were extremelv cautious in discovering the number of her crew. By her quarter bill she had one man more, stationed at each gun, than the Con stitution. The Java was an important ship. She was fitted out in the most complete manner, to car ry lieutenant general Hislop and staff to Bombay, of which place he had been appointed governour, and several naval officers for different vessels in the East Indies. She had despatches for St. Helena, the Cape of Good Hope, and for every British es tablishment in the Indian and Chinese seas. She had copper on board for a seventy-four, and for two brigs, building at Bombay ; and probably a number of other valuable ailicles."], [89, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 75 The great distance from the United States, and the disabled state ofthe Java, forbade every idea of attempting to bring her to the United States. No alternative was therefore left, but to burn her, which was done, after the prisoners and their baggage were removed to the Constitution. They were all landed at St. Salvador, and paroled. The commander of the Java, captain Lambert, died soon after he was put on shore. The British officers paroled were a lieutenant-general, a major, and a captain, of land service ; in the naval service, a post captain, a mas ter and commander, five lieutenants, three lieuten ants of marines, a surgeon, two assistant surgeons, a purser, fifteen midshipmen, a gunner, a boatswain, a master, a carpenter, and two captain's clerks ; like wise, three hundred and twenty-three petty officers, seamen, and marines \u2014 making all together three hundred and fifty-one men ; besides nine Portuguese seamen, liberated, and eight passengers, private characters, who were permitted to land without restraint. Lieutenant Aylwin, of the Constitution, was se verely wounded during the action. When the boarders were called to repel boarders, he mounted the quarter-deck hammock cloths, and, in the act of firing his pistol at the enemy, he received a ball through his shoulder. Notwithstanding the severity of his wound, he continued at his post until the enemy struck. A few days afterwards, when an engagement was expected with a ship, which after wards proved to be the Hornet, he left his bed, and"], [90, "76 NAVAL TEMPLE. repaired to quarters, though labouring under a con siderable debility, and under the most excruciating pain. He died on the 28th of January, at sea. Commodore Bainbridge was received by his coun trymen on his return to the United States, with every demonstration of joy and esteem that his gal lant exploit merited. The Congress of the United States voted fifty thousand dollars, and their thanks, to commodore Bainbridge, his officers and crew. They likewise ordered a gold medal to be presented to commodore Bainbridge, and silver ones to each of his officers, in token of their esteem. The legislatures of Massachusetts and New York, &c. voted their thanks to commodore Bainbridge, his officers, and crew.* HORNET AND PEACOCK. The Hornet, of eighteen guns, commanded by captain Lawrence, as stated in the preceding article, sailed in company with the Constitution. Such was the eagerness of captain Lawrence to- engage the Bonne Citoyenne, though a much larger vessel, and having a greater force, both in guns and men, that he sent, through the American consul at St. Salva dor, a challenge to her commander, captain Greene, * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 188 \u2014 192."], [91, "NAVAL TEMPLE1. 77 pledging his honour, that neither the Constitution, nor any other American vessels should interfere. This pledge was confirmed by commodore Bain bridge, who to show his sincerity, left the Hornet before St. Salvador, and sailed on another cruise. The commander of the Bonne Citoyenne, however did not see fit to accept of the challenge, but suf fered himself to be blockaded by the Hornet. Captain Lawrence continued for fourteen days off the harbour of St. Salvador, blockading the Bonne Citoyenne. Two other English vessels were like wise in the same port, namely, the Fox, of twelve guns, and an armed schooner. On the 24th of January, the Montague of seventy four guns, hove in sight, and drove the Hornet into the harbour \u2014 but night coming on, she wore, and stood out to the southward. Captain Lawrence, knowing that the seventy-four had come for the purpose of relieving the Bonne Citoyenne and packet Fox from blockade, judged it most prudent to change his cruising ground. He therefore hauled by the wind to the westward, with the inten tion of cruising off Pernambuco. On the 10th of February he captured the English brig Resolution, of ten guns, bound to Maranham, from Rio Janeiro, laden with coffee, jerked beef, flour, fustic, butter, and about twenty-five thousand dollars in specie. As this vessel sailed dull, and as captain Lawrence could not spare hands to man her, lie took out the money, and set her on fire."], [92, "78 NAVAL TEMPLE. He then ran down the coast for Maranham ; and cruised there a short time. Thence he ran off Surinam. After cruising off that coast from the fifteenth to the twenty-third of Februry, without meeting with a vessel, he stood for Demarara ; and intended, should he not be fortunate on that station, to run through the West Indies, on his wray to the United States \u2014 but, on the 24th, in the morning, he discovered a brig to leeward; to which he imme- diately gave chase. Not having a pilot on board, he was obliged to haul off. The fort at the entrance of Demarara river bore southwest, distant about two and a half leagues. Previous to giving up the chase, captain Lawrence discovered a vessel at anchor without the bar, with English colours flying. She appeared to be a brig of war. In beating round Carobana bank, in order to get to her, at half past three p. m. he discovered another sail on his weather quarter, edging down for him. At twenty minutes past four, she hoisted English colours. She was now discovered to be a large man of war brig. Captain Lawrence immediately ordered his men to quarters, and had the ship cleared for action. He kept close by the wind, in order if possible, to get the weathergage of the approaching vessel. At ten minutes past five, finding he could weather the enemy, he hoisted American colours and tacked. About a quarter of an hour after this, the ships pass ed each other, and exchanged broadsides within half pistol shot. Captain Lawrence observing the enemy in the act of wearing, bore up, received his"], [93, "79 NAVAL TEMPLE. starboard broadside, and ran him close on board on the starboard quarter. From that position he kept up a most severe and well directed fire. So great was its effect, that, in less than fifteen minutes the British vessel struck. She was almost cut to pieces, and hoisted an ensign, union down, from her fore rigging, as a signal of distress. Shortly after, her mainmast went by the board. Lieutenant Shubrick was despatched on board. He soon returned with her first lieutenant, who reported her to be his Britannick Majesty's brig Peacock, commanded by captain William Peake, who fell in the action \u2014 that a number of her crew were killed and wounded \u2014 and that she was sinking very fast, having then six feet water in her hold. The boats of the Hornet were immediately des patched for the wounded. Both vessels were brought to anchor. Those shot holes in the Pea cock that could be got at, were then plugged, and her guns thrown overboard. Every exertion was used to keep her afloat, until the prisoners could be removed, by pumping and bailing, but without effect. She unfortunately sunk in five and a half fathoms water, with thirteen of her crew, and three of the Hornet's. Lieutenant Connor, midshipman Cooper, and the remainder of the men employed in removing the prisoners, with difficulty saved them selves by jumping into a boat that was lying on the booms, as the vessel went down. Four men of the Peacock's crew, who were on board when she went down, and were so fortunate as to gain the foretop,"], [94, "80 NAVAL TEMPLE. were afterwards taken off by the Hornet's boats. Previous to the Peacock's sinking, four of her men took to her stern boat, witch had been much damaged during the action. There was little or no prospect of their reaching the land. They, how ever, arrived safe at Demarara. Captain Lawrence could not ascertain from the officers of the Peacock the exact number of killed. Captain Peake and four men . were found dead on board. The master, one midshipman, carpenter, captain's clerk, and twenty-nine seamen of the Pea cock, were wounded ; most of them very severely \u2014 three died after being removed \u2014 nine were drowned. The Hornet had only one man killed, and two slightly wounded. Two men were also severely burnt by the explosion of a cartridge, one of whom died a few days after. The rigging and sails of the Hornet were much cut. A shot passed through the foremast ; the bowsprit was slightly injured ; but her hull received very little injury. At the time captain Lawrence brought the Pea cock to action, the Espiegle, the brig mentioned as being at anchor, lay within six miles of the Hornet, between her and the shore, and could plainly see the whole of the action. She mounted eighteen guns. Supposing that she would beat out to the assistance of her consort, great exertions were used by the officers and crew of the Hornet, to repair her damages. By nine o'clock her boats were stowed ; a new set of sails bent ; and the ship completely ready for action."], [95, "81 NAVAL TEMPLE. At two o'clock, a. m. the Hornet got under way, and stood by the wind to the northward and west ward, under easy sail. On mustering next morning, two hundred and seventy souls were found to be on board the Hornet. As the crew of the latter had been for some time on short allowance, captain Lawrence resolved to make the best of his way to the United States. The Peacock was deservedly styled one of the finest vessels of her class in the British navy. She was about the tonnage of the Hornet. Her beam was greater by five inches ; but her extreme length not so great by four feet. She mounted sixteen four-and-twenty pound carronades, two long nines, a twelve pound carronade on her top gallant fore castle as a shifting gun, and a four or six pounder, and two swivels aft. By her quarter bill, her crew consisted of one hundred and thirty-four men, four of whom were absent in a prize, besides four men and one boy, who were not on her quarter bill. Of the Hornet's crew, the sailing master and seven men were absent in a prize ; and lieutenant Stewart and six men on the sick list. The conduct of the Hornet's crew towards the British seamen, who, by the sinking of their vessel, had lost every thing except what they had on their backs, manifested much humanity and generosity. They raised among themselves a sufficiency to sup ply these distressed seamen, with two shirts, a blue jacket and trowsers each. The surviving officers of the Peacock returned a publick acknowledgment II"], [96, "82 NAVAL TEMPLE. to the captain and officers of the Hornet, for the hu manity and kindness wherewith they treated them. Captain Lawrence on his return to the United States was received with great distinction and ap plause. The same tokens of approbation and esteem were conferred on him by publick bodies, with which other gallant and successful commanders had been honoured.* CHESAPEAKE AND SHANNON. The Chesapeake frigate, commanded by captain Evans, sailed from Boston about the middle of No vember, 1812; and after a cruise of one hundred and fifteen days, returned to Boston. During the cruise several captures of some importance were made. The Chesapeake continued in Boston harbour until the first of June, the day of her unfortunate rencounter witli the Shannon. Captain Lawrence, of the Hornet, had a short time previous been ap pointed to command the Chesapeake, and hardly had he arrived at Boston, when the Shannon, com manded by captain Broke, appeared off the harbour with the avowed purpose of seeking a combat with her. \" Stung with the repeated disasters of the British frigates, this officer resolved to make an effort to * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 202 \u2014 205."], [97, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 83 retrieve them ; and when he deemed his ship per fectly prepared for that purpose, sent a formal chal lenge to captain Lawrence. \" ' As the Chesapeake,' his letter began, ' appears now ready for sea, I request you will do me the favour to meet the Shannon with her, ship to ship, to try the fortune of our respective flags. To an officer of your character, it requires some apology for proceeding to further particulars. Be assured, sir, that it is not from any doubt I entertain of your wishing to close with my proposal, but merely to provide an answer to any objection that might be made, and very reasonably, upon the chance of our receiving unfair support.' After observing that commodore Rodgers had not accepted several ver bal challenges which he had given, captain Broke then proceeds to state very minutely the force of the Shannon, and offers to send all British ships out of reach, so that they might have a fair combat, at any place within a certain range along the coast of New England which he specified ; if more agree able, he offers to sail together, and to warn the Chesapeake, by means of private signals, of the approach of British ships of war, till they reach some solitary spot \u2014 or to sail with a flag of truce to any place out of the reach of British aid, so that the flag should be hauled down when it was deemed fair to begin hostilities. ' I entreat you, sir,' he concludes, ' not to imagine that I am urged by mere personal vanity to the wish of meeting the Chesa peake, or that I depend only upon your personal"], [98, "84 NAVAL TEMPLE. ambition for your acceding to this invitation. \\V e have both nobler motives. You will feel it as a compliment, if I say that the result of our meeting may be the most grateful service I can render to my country ; and I doubt not that you, equally con fident of success, will feel convinced that it is only by repeated triumphs in even combats, that your little navy can now hope to console your country for the loss of that trade it can no longer protect.' \" The style of this letter, with the exception of the puerile bravado about commodore Rodgers, is frank and manly ; and if the force of the Shannon were correctly stated, would be such a challenge as might well be sent from a brave seaman to a gallant adversary. We, however, are but too well satisfied, that captain Broke studiously underrated the num- ber of his guns and crew ; or that, after his chal- lenge, he must have received additions to both. That the Shannon had more guns than the number stated by her commander, we learn from the testi- mony of the surviving officers of the Chesapeake ; who also assert, that she had three hundred and seventy-six men; that she had an officer and six- teen men from the Belle Poule ; and that the hats of some of her seamen were marked ' Tenedos.' Such as it was, however, this letter, most unfor- tunately, never reached captain Lawrence. If he had received it ; if he had been thus warned to pre pare his ship; if he had had an opportunity of selecting his officers, and disciplining his crew ; if, in short, he had been able to place the Chesapeake"], [99, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 85 on any thing like equal terms with the Shannon, the combat might have been more bloody \u2014 there might have been such an engagement as has not yet been seen between single ships on the ocean ; though we cannot suffer ourselves to doubt the result of it. But he knew nothing of this chal- lenge \u2014 he saw only the Shannon riding before him in defiance ; he remembered the spirit with which he himself overawed a superior, and he could not brook for a moment, that an enemy, which seemed to be his equal, should insult his flag. Although, therefore, the Chesapeake was comparatively an inferiour ship \u2014 although his first lieutenant was sick on shore \u2014 although three of his lieutenants had recently left her; and, of the four who remained, two were only midshipmen, acting as lieutenants \u2014 although part of his crew were new hands, and all of them had lost some of their discipline by staying in port \u2014 yet, as he would have gone to sea in that situation had no enemy appeared, he felt himself bound not to delay sailing on that account, and throwing himself, therefore, on his courage and his fortune, he determined at once to attack the enemy. It was on the morning of the 1st of June, 1813, that the Chesapeake sailed out of the harbour of Boston, to meet the Shannon. As soon as she got under way, captain Lawrence called the crew together, and having hoisted the white flag, with the motto of ' free trade and sailor's rights,' made a short address. His speech, however, was received with no enthu siasm \u2014 on the contrary, signs of dissatisfaction were"], [100, "86 NAVAL TEMPLE. evident; particularly from a boatswain's mate, a Portuguese, who seemed to be at the head of the malecontents ; and complaints were muttered, that they had not yet received their prize money. Such expressions, at the eve of an action, were but ill bodings of the result of it ; but captain Lawrence, ignorant as he was of the characters of his sailors, and unwilling at such a moment to damp their spirits by harshness, preserved his accustomed calmness, and had prize-checks, at once, given by the purser to those who had not received them. Whilst this scene was passing, the Shannon, observing the Chesapeake coming out, bore away. The Chesa peake followed her till four o'clock in the after noon, when she hauled up and fired a gun, on which the Shannon hove to. They man\u0153uvred for some time, till, at about a quarter before six, they ap proached within pistol shot and exchanged broad sides. \" These broadsides were both bloody ; but the fire of the Shannon was most fortunate in the des truction of officers. The fourth lieutenant, Mr. Ballard, was mortally wounded \u2014 the sailing master was killed, and captain Lawrence received a mus ket ball in his leg, which caused great pain, and profuse bleeding, but he leaned on the companion way, and contiued to order and to animate his crew. A second, and a third broadside was exchanged, with evident advantage on the part of the Chesa peake ; but, unfortunately, among those now wound ed on board of her was the first lieutenant, Mr."], [101, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 87 Ludlow, who was carried below \u2014 three men were successively shot from the helm, in about twelve mi nutes from the commencement of the action ; and, as the hands were shifting, a shot disabled her fore sail, so that she would no longer answer her helm, and her anchor caught in one of the after ports of the Shannon, which enabled the latter to rake her upper deck. As soon as captain Lawrence perceived that she was falling to leeward, and that by the Shan non's filling she vrould fall on board, he called his boarders, and was giving orders about the foresail, when he received a musket ball in his body. The bugleman, who should have called the boarders, did not do his duty ; and, at this moment, commodore Broke, whose ship had suffered so much that he was preparing to repel boarding ; perceiving, from this accident, how the deck of the Chesapeake was swept, jumped on board with about twenty men. They would have been instantly repelled ; but the captain, the first lieutenant, the sailing-master, the boatswain, the lieutenant of marines, the only act ing lieutenant on the spar-deck, were all killed or disabled. At the call of the boarders, lieutenant Cox ran on deck, but just in time to receive his falling commander, and bear him below. Lieuten ant Budd, the second lieutenant, led up the board ers, but only fifteen or twenty would follow him, and with these he defended the ship till he was wounded and disabled. Lieutenant Ludlow, wound ed as he was, hurried upon deck, where he soon received a mortal cut from a sabre. The marine^"], [102, "88 NAVAL TEMPLE. who were engaged fought with desperate courage ; but they were few in number ; too many of them havino- followed the Portuguese boatswain's mate, who exclaimed, it is said, as he skulked below, * so much for not paying men their prize-money.' Meanwhile the Shannon threw on board sixty addi tional men, who soon succeeded in overpowering the seamen of the Chesapeake, who had now no officers to lead or rally them, and took possession of the ship ; which was not, however, surrendered by any signal of submission, but became the enemy's only because they were able to overwhelm all who were in a condition to resist. \" As captain Lawrence was carried below, he perceived the melancholy condition of the Chesa peake, but cried out, ' Don't surrender the ship.' He was taken down into the ward-room, and, as he lay in excruciating pain, perceiving that the noise above had ceased, he ordered the surgeon to go on deck, and tell the officers to fight on to the last, and never strike the colours. ' They shall wave,' said he, ' while I live.' But it was too late to resist or to struggle longer ; the enemy had already pos session of the ship. As captain Lawrence's wounds would not allow of his removal, he continued in the ward-room, surrounded by his wounded officers, and, after lingering in great pain for four days, during which his sufferings were too acute to permit him to speak, or, perhaps, to think of the sad events he had just witnessed, or do more than ask for what his situation required, he died on the 5th of"], [103, "89 NAVAL TEMPLE. June. His body was wrapped in the colours of the Chesapeake, and laid on the quarter deck, until they arrived at -Halifax, where he was buried with the highest military and naval honours ; the British officers forgetting in their admiration of his charac ter, that he had been but lately their enemy. His pall was supported by the oldest captains in the navy then at Halifax, and no demonstration of res pectful attention was omitted to honour the remains of a brave, but unfortunate stranger. \" In this sanguinary engagement the Chesapeake lost her commander and forty-seven men killed, and ninety-seven wounded, of whom fourteen afterwards died. Among these were lieutenant Ludlow, first lieutenant of the ship, and lieutenant Ballard, the fourth lieutenant, both excellent officers. \" On the part of the Shannon captain Broke was dangerously wounded, though he has since recover ed ; the first lieutenant, the purser, captain's clerk, and twenty-three seamen killed, and fifty-seven persons wounded, besides captain Broke. \" The capture of the Chesapeake is to be as cribed wholly to the extraordinary loss of officers (a loss without any precedent, as far as we can recol lect, in naval history;) and to her failing acci dentally on board the Shannon. During the three broadsides, while the officers of the Chesapeake were living, and she was kept clear of the enemy, the superiority was manifestly with the Americans. The Chesapeake had received scarcely any damage, while the Shannon had several shot between wind 12"], [104, "90 NAVAL TEMPLE. and water, and could with difficulty be kept afloat during the succeeding night. It was only when ac cident threw the Chesapeake on board the Shannon, when her officers were unable to lead on the boarders, that captain Broke himself, contrary, we believe, to the regulations of the British navy, left his own ship, and was able, by superior numbers, to overpower the distracted crew of the Chesapeake. \" We have heard many accounts, which we are very reluctantly compelled to believe, of improper conduct by the British after the capture, and of brutal violence offered to the crew of the Chesa peake. As, however, some allowances are due to the exasperated passions of the moment, something too to the confusion of a bloody and doubtful struggle, we are unwilling to prolong the remem brance of imputations which may be disproved, and perhaps have been exaggerated. \" But we should wrong the memory of captain Lawrence, we should be unjust to the officers of the American navy, with whose glory all the aspiring ambition of the country is so closely blended, if we omitted any opportunity of giving the last, and fair est lustre to their fame, by contrasting their conduct with that of the enemy, or if we forbore, from any misplaced delicacy towards our adversaries, to re port circumstances connected with the fate of the Chesapeake, which throw a broad and dazzling light on the generous magnanimity of our countrymen.\" Our readers cannot have failed to observe the liberality which was extended to the officers and"], [105, "91 NAVAL TEMPLE. crews of the Guerriere, Macedonian, and Java, and the still more striking instance of the Peacock. \" When the Chesapeake was taken by the Shannon, the key of captain Lawrence's store-room was de manded of the purser. It was given ; but the purser observed at the same time, that in the cap tures of the Guerriere, Macedonian, and Java, the most scrupulous regard was paid to the private pro perty of the British officers; that captain Lawrence had laid in stores for a long cruise ; and that the value of them would be a great object to his widow and family, for whose use he was desirous, if possi ble, of preserving them. This request was not merely declined ; it was haughtily and superci liously refused. \" However we may mourn the sufferings of that day, the loss of the Chesapeake has not, in our esti mation, varied the relative standing of the marine of the two countries ; nor does it abate, in the slightest degree, any of the loftiness of our naval pretensions. The contest was wholly unequal in ships, in guns, in crews, in officers, in every thing. \" The Shannon was a better ship ; she had not upon her the curse of that ill-omened name, the Chesapeake. The Shannon was a stronger ship ; she mounted twenty-eight eighteen pounders on the main deck, twenty-two thirty-two pound car ronades, and two long brass nines or twelves, on the spar deck, and a large carronade amidships, in all fif ty4wo guns, besides this last heavy carronade ; while the Chesapeake mounted twenty-eight eighteen"], [106, "92 NAVAL TEMPLE. pounders on the main deck, and twenty thirty two pound carronades, and one eighteen pounder, chase gun, on the spar deck, in all forty-nine guns. \" The Shannon had a better crew. Besides her complement she had seamen from two other ships. That crew, too, had been long at sea ; long in the ship ; were known ; were tried ; and as commodore Broke sent a challenge, were, of course, men on whom, if they were not picked for the occasion, he knew he could confide. The Chesapeake had, on the contrary, in part, a new crew, unknown to then officers, not yet knowing their places or the ship. The ship had not been more than a few hours at sea, and the landsmen and the landswomen had been dismissed from her on the very day of the engage ment. The officers, too, although we should be the last to detract from their merits, and although the manner in which they fought their ship does them the highest honour, the officers were young and few in number, and had as yet hardly any op portunity of disciplining or knowing their seamen ; yet, under all these disadvantages, the great damage sustained by the Shannon, and the great loss of her crew, all which took place before the boarding, warrant completely the opinion, that, but for the accidental loss of officers, the victory would have been with the Chesapeake.\"* Mr. Crowninshield, of Salem, obtained a flag of truce for the purpose of conveying to the United States the bodies of Lawrence and Ludlow, which * Port Folio."], [107, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 93 he performed. On his return to Salem, the bodies of the departed heroes were conveyed, with the most affecting ceremonies, from the cartel to the shore. From the time the boats left the brig, until the bodies were landed, minute guns were fired from the vessels in the harbour. When placed upon the hearses, they were covered with the colours, which they had so lately and so signally honoured, and moved to a convenient distance for the procession to form, which moved to solemn musick, to the meetinghouse. The corpses were then placed in the centre of the church, by the seamen who rowed them to the shore, and who stood, during the whole of the service, leaning upon them in an attitude of mourning. The church was hung with cypress and evergreen. The names of Lawrence and Ludlow appeared in letters of gold, encircled by festoons of evergreen, immedi ately in front of the desk. An eulogy was pro nounced by the honourable judge Story. After the performances in the meetinghouse, the seamen conveyed the remains to the tomb, where the ma sonick societies and military corps, paid the last ritual homage to the illustrious dead. The bodies of the deceased, at the request of their relatives, were afterwards carried to New York, and interred with the respect due to brave men, sacrificed in defence of their country."], [108, "94 NAVAL TEMPLE. COM. DECATUR BLOCKADED IN NEW LONDON. In the early part of the summer, (1813,) commo dore Decatur, in the frigate United States, accom panied by the Macedonian, captain Jones, and the sloop of war Hornet, put to sea from New York. But a very superior force, consisting of line of battle ships and frigates, hove in sight and gave chase immediately after he left port. The Ameri can squadron was fortunate enough to reach the harbour of New London, where, for the remainder of the summer, they were blockaded, without any thing interesting occurring except an attempt made to blow up some of the English vessels by a fireship. The fireship was called the Eagle, and fitted out for the purpose by John Scudder. It was supposed that on her being captured, she would be taken along side one of the vessels of war, when, in at tempting to unlade her, a considerable quantity of powder and other combustibles would have been set on fire. The attempt was made in the month of June. She was taken possession of by the British ; but blew up before she got alongside any of their large vessels. At the time of explosion, four boats were seen alongside, which were all, with the men on board them, destroyed. It is supposed that upwards of one hundred of the British perished."], [109, "95 NAVAL TEMPLE. CAPTURE OF THE EAGLE. In the month of July, a fishing smack was sent by commodore Lewis, of New York, for the pur pose of capturing by stratagem the sloop Eagle, a tender of the Poictiers, a British vessel of seventy four guns. The smack was borrowed of some fishermen. A calf, a sheep, and goose, were put on board. Between thirty and forty men well armed with muskets were secreted in the cabin, and fore peak of the smack. Thus prepared she stood out to sea as if going on a fishing voyage to the banks. Only three men appeared on deck, dressed as fishermen. The Eagle, on perceiving the smack, gave chase. After coming along side, and discovering live stock on board, she ordered the smack down to the commodore, then about five miles off. The helmsman of the smack answered, \" Aye, aye, sir ;\" and apparently put up the helm for that purpose, which brought the smack along side the Eagle, not more than three yards distant. The watch word Lawrence, was then given, and the armed men rushed on deck from below; and poured a volley of musketry into the tender ; which drove her crew below with so much precipi tancy, that they had not time to strike her colours. As soon as sailing master Percival, who commanded the smack, perceived the deck of the British vessel cleared, he ordered his men to cease filing. Upon"], [110, "96 NAVAL TEMPLE. which one of the Eagle's crew appeared on deck, and struck her colours. The Eagle was safely taken into New York.* THIRD CRUISE OF THE PRESIDENT. On the 23d of April, 1813, commodore Rodgers put to sea from Boston, in the President frigate, accompanied by the Congress, commanded by cap tain Smith. On the 30th he took his departure from President road. On the 3d of May, while in chase of a British brig of war, near the shoal of George's Bank, they passed to windward of three sail, one of which was supposed to be the La Hogue, seventy-four ; the others, the Nymph frigate and a merchant brig. After getting clear of George's Bank, they continued along southeastwardly, in the direction of the southern edge of the Gulf stream, till the 8th of May, when the President parted from the Congress. Commodore Rodgers then shaped his course, as near as the wind would permit, to intercept the enemy's West India commerce, pass ing to the southward of the Grand Bank. Not meeting with any thing in this direction, except American vessels from Lisbon and Cadiz, he changed his course to the northward. Having reached the forty-eighth degree of north latitude, * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 209."], [111, "97 NAVAL TEMPLE. he steered for the Azores, off which he continued in different directions till the 6th of June, without meeting any British vessels. Being informed by an American vessel, that four days previous she had passed a British convoy from the West Indies, the commodore crowded all sail in chase to northeast. Though disappointed in falling in with the convoy, he nevertheless captured four vessels. Being then in latitude forty-six north, longitude twenty-eight west, he determined to proceed to the North Sea. He however did not meet with a single vessel until off the Shetland Islands, and those he there met with were Danish, under British license. His water and provisions being now nearly exhausted, he put into North Bergen, in Norway, on the 27th of June. A scarcity in the country prevented his obtaining provisions. After having filled his casks with Avater, he departed on the 2d of July, toAvards the Orkney Islands, and thence to ward the North Cape, for the purpose of intercept ing a convoy of twenty-five or thirty sail, which, it was said, would leave Archangel about the middle of July, under the protection of two sloops of war. This was confirmed by tAvo vessels he captured on the 18th of the same month. In this, however, the commodore Avas disappointed by a seventy-four and frigate making their appearance off North Cape on the 1 9th of July, just as he was in momentary ex pectation of meeting the convoy. On first dis covering these two vessels, owing to the haziness of the Aveather, he could not ascertain their character 13"], [112, "98 NAVAL TEMPLE. Avith precision. He accordingly stood towards them until he discovered their strength, when he hauled by the Avind on the opposite tack to avoid them. But OAving to faint variable winds, and light for an entire day, for in that latitude and season the sun appeared above the horizon at midnight, the British vessels were enabled to continue the chase upwards of eighty hours. At times, owing to changes of the wind in favour of the British vessels, they Avere brought near to the President. When these vessels gave chase to the President, the priva teer Scourge of New York Avas in company, but so intent Avere the British in their chase of the former, that the latter escaped. Having but a very small quantity of provisions on board his vessel, commodore Rodgers deter mined to proceed to a more Avesterly station after having escaped from the superior British force that so long chased him. He accordingly steered to intercept the trade passing out of and into the Irish channel, Avhere on the 25th of July and 2d of August he made three captures ; but receiving information that the British had a superior force in the vicinity, he deemed it expedient to change his cruising ground. After having made a circuit round Ire land, and having come info the latitude of Cape Clear, he steered for the Banks of NeAvfoundland, near to Avhich he captured two more vessels : from one of these he obtained information that the Belle rophon, a seventy-four, and the Hyperion frigate, Avere on the eastern part of the bank, only a few"], [113, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 99 miles to the westward of him. He however did not fall in Avith them. From this place the commodore directed his cruise to the United States, without seeing a single vessel until the 22d of September, Avhen, being near the south shoal of Nantucket, he met Avith a Swedish brig, and American cartel. By this time the provisions, and particularly the bread on board the President, Avere so nearly expended, that it became indispensably necessary for the com modore to put into the first com^enient port, after obtaining information of the position of the British cruisers. This he obtained by the capture of his Britannick Majesty's schooner High Flyer, on the 23d, with Avhich vessel he arrived safe at Newport. During this cruise commodore Rodgers captured twelve vessels, of Avhich the crews amounted to two hundred and seventy-one persons. He rendered very effectual service to his country by harassing the British commerce, and forcing them to detach a great number of their vessels of war in an unsuc cessful pursuit,* It is a circumstance, somewhat singular, that, since the rencounter with the Belvidere, commodore Rodgers has never met with an English frigate that was not in company with a seventy-four ; notwith standing he cruised in the European seas, and coasted the shores of Britain and Ireland. He twice traversed over more than half the globe, with out ever meeting a British frigate ; and though he * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 213, 214."], [114, "100 NAVAL TEMPLE. sought them in their own seas, and along their own shores, he never had the good fortune to bring one of them to action. Yet, with all this, commodore Rodgers has suffered no dimunition of reputation. It is creditable to the American character, to cherish and uphold the high reputation of a merito rious officer, notAvithstanding opportunities have not been given him to display his skill and proAvess against an equal force of the enemy. CRUISE OF THE CONGRESS. The Congress, after parting Avith the President, on the 8th of May, proceeded, in a circuitous di rection, to the southeast, crossing the equator, pass ing the northeast coast of Brazil, and thence home ward. During his cruise, captain Smith made prizes of three valuable vessels of the enemy, two of which were destroyed, after taking out the most valuable part of their cargoes ; and the other given up to the prisoners, who were paroled. He arrived in Portsmouth harbour on the 14th of December."], [115, "101 NAVAL TEMPLE. ARGUS AND PELICAN. Captain Allen, in the brig Argus, sailed from the United States for France, having on board Mr. CraAvford, minister to the court of Paris, in May, 1813. He arrived there in the short passage of twenty-three days, during Avhich he captured and destroyed a British schooner of six guns. After remaining at L'Orient a few days, he pro ceeded on a cruise in the British channel, Avhere he captured tAventy English vessels ; the crews of which he treated Avith humanity and generosity. The injury which captain Allen did to the British commerce is, in some of their papers, estimated to the amount of two millions. While employed in burning, sinking and destroying the enemy's pro perty, he was peculiarly careful to distinguish his character from those who depredated for selfish purposes only. The property of the passengers Avas sacred from hostility ; not an article of that kind would he suffer to be touched. The passen gers were allowed to go below, and to take Avhat they claimed as their own, and no hands belonging to the Argus were permitted to inspect them Avhile they were employed in so doing. On one occasion, when a passenger had left his surtout behind him, it was sent after him in the boat: on another occasion, captain Allen ordered one of his hands, who was detected in the act of"], [116, "102 NAVAL TEMPLE. some petty plunder of this kind, to be flogged at the gangAvay. The English papers, while they were Avrithing under the severe injuries thus in flicted, Avere unanimous in their testimonials of respect to the conduct of this gallant officer, for the humanity and delicacy with which he performed a service so invidious. Probably no action of his life could more plainly distinguish his character than this: he loved danger as much as he abhorred to plunder the defenceless. On the 14th of August, being in latitude fifty two degrees fifteen minutes north, longitude fiAre degrees fifty minutes west, he discovered, at four o'clock, a. m. a large brig of war, standing down under a press of sail upon the Aveather quarter of the Argus. Captain Allen immediately prepared to receive her ; and being unable to get the Aveather gage, he shortened sail, and gave her an opportunity of closing. At six o'clock, the brig having display ed English colours, the Argus hoisted the Ameri can flag, wore round, and gave her the larboard broadside, being at this time Avithin grape distance, which Avas returned, and the action commenced within the range of musketry. A few minutes past six, captain Allen was Avounded ; and, being much exhausted by the loss of blood, Avas taken below. At this time, the Argus had lost her main braces, main springstay, gaff, and try-sail mast, and shortly after her sprit-sail-yard, and the principal part of the rigging on the larboard side of the foremast."], [117, "103 NAVAL TEMPLE. Lieutenant Watson, upon whom the command of the vessel devolved, after captain Allen Avas carried below, received a wound on the head from a grape shot, which, for a time, rendered him incapable of attending to duty, and he was also carried below. The command now devolved upon lieutenant Allen ; the enemy, being on the weather quarter of the Ar gus, edged off, for the purpose of getting under her stern, but the Argus frustrated his attempt by giving him a broadside. About half past six, the Argus, having lost the use of her after-sails, fell before the wind, when the enemy succeeded in passing her stern, and ranged upon the starboard side. The wheel-ropes, .and rigging of every des cription being shot away, the Argus became un manageable ; and the enemy, not having sustained any apparent damage, had it completely in his power to choose a position. By this advantage he profited, and continued to play upon her starboard quarter, occasionally shifting his situation, when lieutenant Watson returned to the deck, and pre pared to board the enemy ; but, in consequence of the shattered condition of the Argus, was unable to effect it. After this, the British continued a raking fire, Avhich could be but faintly opposed, the guns of the Argus being much disabled, and seldom brought to bear. Having suffered in the hull and rigging, and also in killed and wounded, and being exposed to a galling fire, which, from the enemy's ability to manage, could not be avoided, lieutenant Watson deemed it necessary to surrender. The"], [118, "104 NAVAL TEMPLE. Argus was then taken possession of by the British sloop of war Pelican, of tAventy-one carriage guns, viz. sixteen thirty-two pound carronades, four long sixes, and one twelve pound carronade, commanded by captain Maples. The Argus carried eighteen twenty-four pounders, and tAvo long tAArelves. The loss on board the Pelican, as stated in the British official account, was eight in killed and wounded. The loss in the Argus Avas six killed and twelve Avounded. Five of the wounded died soon after, among whom was captain Allen, who lost his leg at the second broadside, and died the next day. It would be unjust to the feelings which are revived by the preceding account, and ungrateful to the memory of a brave and distinguished officer, to record in our pages only the circumstances which cost him his life, and his countrymen so much poignant regret. The prominent traits of his cha racter, and the honours paid to his remains, in a foreign land, and by those who were his adversaries in war, should be co-extensive Avith every register of naval achievements. The following letter from John Hawker, Esq. ci-devant American consul, will be read Avith interest. Plymouth, August 19, 1813. SlR- \u2014 The station I have had the honour to hold for many years past, of American vice-consul, calls forth my poignant feelings in the communication I"], [119, "105 NAVAL TEMPLE. have to make to you of the death of your son, cap tain Allen, late commander of the United States brig of war Argus, which vessel was captured on Saturday last, in the Irish channel, after a very sharp action of three quarters of an hour, by his Britannick majesty's ship Pelican. Early in the action he lost his left leg, but re fused to be carried below, till from loss of blood he fainted. Messrs. Edwards and Delphy, midship men, and four seamen were killed ; and lieutenant Watson, the carpenter, boatswain, boatswain's mate, and seven men wounded. Captain Allen submitted to amputation above the knee, while at sea. He was yesterday morning attended by very eminent surgical gentlemen, and removed from the Argus to the hospital, where every possible attention and assistance would have been afforded him had he survived ; but which was not, from the first moment, expected, from the shattered state of his thigh. At eleven, last night, he breathed his last ! He was sensible, at intervals, until within ten minutes of his dissolution, when he sunk exhausted, and expired without a struggle ! His lucid intervals were very cheerful, and he Avas satisfied and fully sensible that no advice or assistance would be wanting. A de tached room was prepared by the commissary and chief surgeon, and female attendants engaged, that every tenderness and respect might be experienced. The master, purser, surgeon, and one midshipman, accompanied captain Allen, who was also attended by his two servants. 14"], [120, "106 NAVAL TEMPLE.

Thus lived and thus died William Henry Allen. By the company and conversation of the elegant and polite, the hard and severe duties of the sailor acquired a sort of polish, and his character present ed that combination of gallantry, grace and intre pidity, that so irresistibly attracts. In the hour of danger, he was calm, intrepid and persevering ; in private intercourse, guarded, affable and delicate. Entering into the navy with large and expanded ideas of honour, the perils he encountered, and the hard services he endured, consolidated his romantick and floating visions into rules and principles of action. By never lowering his lofty standard amidst the justle of contending difficulties, he at length arrived at it ; and new trials served only to call into exercise new and unexplored resources of fortitude. He had so long forsaken every other consideration for glory, that he finally measured his life by this standard, and felt a repulsive antipathy to whatever fell short of that measure. There has seemed a sort of compact among our naval commanders, never to quit their station on"], [123, "109 NAVAL TEMPLE. deck. Allen, in his mutilated state, refused to be carried beloAV, and fainted on the deck from loss of blood. Lawrence showed the same determined spirit, and never left his station until he was too far exhausted by his Avounds to animate his men by his example. Burrows, although mortally wounded at his quarters, still remained at his post, survived the action, and there received the sword of his gallant and intrepid antagonist. The following extract from captain Allen's letter, addressed to his sister, will show the character of this intrepid officer in an amiable light : \"When you shall hear that I have ended my earthly career, that I only exist in the kind remem brance of my friends, you will forget my follies, forgive my faults, call to mind some little instances dear to reflection, to excuse your love for me, and shed one tear to the memory of HENRY.\" ENTERPRIZE AND BOXER. On the 1st of September, the United States brig Enterprize, commanded by lieutenant William Bur rows, sailed from Portsmouth on a cruise. On the morning of the 3d, Burrows discovered a schooner, which was chased into Portland harbour, where the Enterprize was brought to anchor. Having re ceived information of several privateers being off"], [124, "110 NAVAL TEMPLE. Manhagan, he Aveighed anchor and swept out the following morning, and stood for that place. Next day a large brig of Avar Avas discovered, to which chase was immediately given. The enemy fired several guns, and stood for the Enterprize, with four ensigns hoisted. Aster man\u0153uvring and reconnoi tering for some time for the purpose of discovering the force of the enemy, lieutenant Burrows, about three in the afternoon, shortened sail, tacked, and run doAvn, with the intention of bringing her to close action. At tAventy minutes after three the firing commenced from both vessels, within half pistol shot. The action continued for about a quarter of an hour, when the Enterprize ranged ahead of the enemy, rounded to, and raked her. Shortly after the main-top-mast and top-sail-yard of the enemy came down. The foresail of the Enterprize was then set, and she took a position on the starboard bow of the enemy, and continued to rake her, until, about forty minutes after the commencement of the action, the enemy ceased firing, and cried for quar ters : their colours being nailed to the masts, could not be hauled doAvn. The prize proved to be the British brig Boxer, of fourteen guns. The number of her crew could not be ascertained, but sixty-four prisoners were taken, including seventeen Avounded. On board the Enterprize there was only one killed and thirteen wounded, two of Avhom died of their Avounds. Lieutenant BurroAvs fell in the commencement of the action ; he, hoAvever, refused to be carried be-"], [125, "111 NAVAL TEMPLE. low, but, raising his head, requested that the flag might never be struck. When the sword of the vanquished enemy was presented to the dying con queror, he clasped his hands and said, \" I am satis fied ; I die contented ;\" and then, and not till then, would he consent to be carried below, where every attention was paid to save his life, but in vain. A feAV hours after the victory he breathed his last. \u2014 Captain Blythe, the commander of the Boxer, also fell in the commencement of the action, having received a cannon shot through the body. His remains, in company with those of lieutenant Bur rows, were brought to Portland, Avhere the two commanders were interred, side by side, with mili tary honours. The Boxer was so much damaged in her sails, rigging, spars, hull, &c. as to render it difficult to carry her into port. The Enterprize received but trifling injury. On an examination of the prize, she was adjudged wholly to the captors, agreeably to law, as a vessel of superior force. Soon after the arrival of the Enterprize and her prize at Portland, the bodies of the two command ing officers, lieutenant Burrows and captain Blythe, were brought on shore in ten oared barges, rowed at minute strokes by masters of ships, accompanied by most of the barges and boats in the harbour, while minute guns were fired from the two vessels. A grand procession was then formed, the corpse of lieutenant Burrows preceding, and the interment took place with all the honours that the civil and"], [126, "112 NAVAL TEMPLE. military authorities at the place, and the great body of the people, could bestow. During the proces sion forts Preble and Scammel, (names dear to their country',) fired minute guns. It is worthy of record that the crew of the Boxer were permitted to march in the late procession at Portland, when their late captain was interred. Such was not the case with the crew of the Chesa peake. The following documents Ave think will be read with more satisfaction than any thing we could write on the same subject; especially the letter from lieutenant M'Call, the officer on whom the command of the Enterprize devolved after lieuten ant Burrows was rendered incapable of directing the action. Copy of a letter from captain Hull to the Secretary of the Navy. Portland, September 7, 1813. Sir, \u2014 I had the honour last evening to forward you by express, through the hands of commodore Bainbridge, a letter received from Samuel Storer, Esq. navy agent at this place, detailing an account of the capture of the British brig Boxer by the United States brig Enterprize. I now have to inform you that I left Portsmouth this morning, and have this moment arrived, and, as the mail is closing, I have only time to enclose you the report of lieutenant M'Call, of the Enterprize, and to assure you that a statement of the situation of the two vessels as to the damage they have re-"], [127, "113 NAVAL TEMPLE. ceived, &c. shall be forwarded as soon as surveys can be made. The Boxer has received much damage in her hull, masts and sails, indeed it was with difficulty she could be kept afloat to get her in. The Enterprize is only injured in her masts and sails. I have the honour to be, &c. ISAAC HULL. The Hon. Wm. Jones, Secretary of the Navy. United States brig Enterprize, Portland, September 7, 1813. Sir, \u2014 In consequence of the unfortunate death of lieutenant-commandant William Burrows, late commander of this vessel, it devolves on me to acquaint you with the result of the cruise. After sailing from Portsmouth on the 1st instant, we steered to the eastward ; and on the morning of the 3d, off Wood Island, discovered a schooner, which we chased into this harbour, where we anchored. On the morning of the 4th, weighed anchor and swept out, and continued our course to the east ward. Having received information of several pri vateers being off Manhagan, Ave stood for that place ; and on the folloAving morning, in the bay near Pen guin Point, discovered a brig getting under way, which appeared to be a vessel of war, and to which we immediately gave chase. She fired several guns and stood for us, having four ensigns hoisted. After reconnoitering and discovering her force, and the nation to which she belonged, we hauled upon a wind to stand out of the bay, and at three o'clock shortened sail, tacked to run down with an intention 15"], [128, "114 SAVAL TEMPLE. to bring her to close action. At twenty minutes after three, p. m. when Avithin half pistol shot, the firing commenced from both, and after being warmly kept up, and Avith some man\u0153uvring, the enemy hailed and said they had surrendered, about four, P. M. \u2014 their colours being nailed to the masts, could not be hauled doAvn. She proved to be his Britan nick majesty's brig Boxer, of fourteen guns, Sam uel Blythe, Esq. commander, Avho fell in the early part of the engagement, having received a cannon shot through the body. And I am sorry to add that lieutenant Burrows, Avho had gallantly led us into action, fell also about the same time by a musket ball, Avhich terminated his existence in eight hours. The Enterprize suffered much in spars and rig ging, and the Boxer in spars, rigging and hull, hav ing many shots between wind and water. It would be doing injustice to the merit of Mr. Tillinghast, second lieutenant, were I not to men tion the able assistance I received from him during the remainder of the engagement, by his strict at tention to his OAvn division and other departments. And of the officers and crew generally, I am happy to add, their cool and determined conduct have my Avarmest approbation and applause. As no muster roll that can be fully relied on has come into my possession, I cannot exactly state the number killed and Avounded on board the Boxer, but from information received from the officers of that vessel, it appears there were betAveen twenty md twenty-five killed and fourteen wounded.

Isaac Hull, Esq. commanding naval officer on the eastern station. A Card. \u2014 Captain Hull, with the officers and crew of the United States brig Enterprize, are deeply impressed with the readiness and alacrity with which the inhabitants of Portland, in their civil and military departments, assembled to do honour to the memory of the brave lieutenant William Burrows, late commander of the Enterprize, who fell in the gallant action with his Britannick majesty's brig Boxer, which she captured and brought into this port ; and beg they will receive their grateful acknowledgments for their very handsome tribute of respect exhibited in their attendance on the funeral of that brave officer, as well as that of his gallant competitor, captain Samuel Blythe, late commander of the Boxer, who fell in the same ac tion, and to whom equal honours were paid in every respect, in their funeral obsequies, exhibit ing to the world an evidence of that character which the Americans are proud to possess, of shoAV ing every tribute of respect to a brave enemy who has fallen in combat, and of extending to those in their power every mark of liberality and comfort consistent Avith their situation as prisoners. Captain Hull, with the officers and crew of the Enterprize, embrace the present occasion to express"], [130, "116 NAVAL TEMPLE. the sense Avhich they entertain of the prompt at tention and of the active and humane exertions of Samuel Storer, Esq. the United States navy agent at Portland, in having every accommodation pro vided for the wounded on board the United States brig Enterprize as Avell as those on board the Boxer, between Avhom no distinction was made. And they likewise beg the physicians of Portland who have been so kind as to afford the most prompt and ample exercise of their professions towards the wounded of both vessels, to accept their best thanks. Extract of a letter from captain Hull to commodore Bainbridge, dated, September 10, 1813. \" I yesterday visited the two brigs, and was as- tonished to see the difference of injury sustained in the action. The Enterprize has but one eighteen pound shot in her hull, one in her mainmast, and one in her foremast ; her sails are much cut with grape shot, and there are a great number of grape lodged in her sides, but no injury done by them. The Boxer has eighteen or twenty eighteen pound shot in her hull, most of them at the water's edge \u2014 several stands of eighteen pound grape stick in her side, and such a quantity of small grape that I did not undertake to count them. Her masts, sails and spars are literally cut to pieces, several of her guns dismounted and unfit for service ; her top gallant forecastle nearly taken off by the shot, her boats cut to pieces,and her quarters injured in proportion. T\u00a9"], [131, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 117 give you an idea of the quantity of shot about her, I inform you that I counted in her mainmast alone three eighteen pound shot holes, eighteen large grape shot holes, sixteen musket ball holes, and a large number of smaller shot holes, without count ing above the cat harpins. \" We find it impossible to get at the number kil led ; no papers are found by which we can ascer tain it \u2014 I, however, counted upwards of ninety hammocks which were in her netting with beds in them, besides several beds without hammocks ; and she has excellent accommodations for all her officers below in state-rooms, so that I have no doubt that she had one hundred men on board. We know that she has several of the Rattler's men on board, and a quantity of wads was taken out of the Rattler, loaded with four large grape shot, with a small hole in the centre to put in a cartridge that the inside of the Avad may take fire when it leaves the gun. In short, she is in every respect completely fitted, and her accommodations exceed any thing I have seen in a vessel of her class.\" A publick dinner was given at Portland to lieu tenant M'Call and the other officers of the Enter prize, for their gallant conduct in the action with the Boxer."], [132, "118 NAVAL TEMPLE. THE ESSEX. Captain Porter, in the frigate Essex, proceed ed to sea from the Delaware, on the twenty seventh of October, 1812, and repaired, agreeably to instructions from commodore Bainbridge, to the coast of Brazil, where different places of rendez vous had been arranged between them. In the course of his cruise on this coast he captured his Britannick majesty's packet Nocton, and after tak ing out of her about eleven thousand pounds sterl ing in specie, ordered her for America. Hearing of commodore Bainbridge 's victorious action with the Java, which Avould oblige him to return to port, and of the capture of the Hornet by the Montague, and learning that there was a considerable augmen tation of British force on the coast, and several ships in pursuit of him, he abandoned his hazardous cruising ground, and stretched away to the south ward, scouring the coast as far as Rio de la Plata. From thence he shaped his course for the Pacifick Ocean, and, after suffering greatly for want of pro visions, and heavy gales off Cape Horn, arrived at Valparaiso, on the 14th of March, 1813. Having victualled his ship, he ran down the coast of Chili and Peru, and fell in Avith a Peruvian corsair, hav ing on board twenty-four Americans, as prisoners, the crews of two whaling ships, which she had taken on the coast of Chili. The Peruvian captain justi-"], [133, "119 NAVAL TEMPLE. fied his conduct on the plea of being an ally of Great Britain, and the expectation likewise of a speedy war between Spain and the United States. Finding him resolved to persist in similar aggres sions, captain Porter threw all his guns and ammu nition into the sea, liberated the Americans, and wrote a respectful letter to the viceroy explaining his reasons for so doing, which he delivered to the captain. He then proceeded to Lima, and luckily recaptured one of the American vessels as she was entering the port. After this he cruised for several months in the Pacifick, inflicting immense injury on the British commerce in those waters. He was particularly destructive to the shipping employed in the sper maceti whale fishery. A great number Avith valua ble cargoes were captured ; two were given up to the prisoners ; three sent to Valparaiso and laid up ; three sent to America ; one of them he retained as a storeship, and another he equipped with twenty guns, called the Essex junior, and gave the command of her to lieutenant DoAvnes. Most of these ships mounted several guns, and had numerous crews; and as several of them were captured by boats or by prizes, the officers and men of the Essex had frequent opportunities of showing their skill and courage, and of acquiring experience and confi dence in naval conflict. Having noAV a little squadron under his com mand, captain Porter became a complete terror in those seas. As his numerous prizes supplied him"], [134, "120 NAVAL TEMPLE. abundantly with provisions, clothing, medicine, and naval stores of every description, he was enabled for a long time to keep the sea, without sickness or inconvenience to his crew; living entirely on the enemy, and being enabled to make considerable ad vances of pay to his officers and creAV without draw ino- on government. The unexampled devastation achieved by his daring enterprises, not only spread alarm throughout the ports of the Pacifick, but even occasioned great uneasiness in Great Britain. Numerous ships were sent out to the Pacifick in pursuit of him ; others were ordered to cruise in the China seas, off NeAv Zealand, Timor and New Hol land, and a frigate sent to the river La Plata. The manner in which captain Porter cruised, hoAvever, completely baffled pursuit. Keeping in the open seas, or lurking among the numerous barren and desolate islands that form the Gallipagos groupe, and never touching on the American coast, he left no traces by which he could be followed ; rumour, while it magnified his exploits, threw his pursuers at fault ; they were distracted by vague accounts of captures made at different places, and of frigates supposed to be the Essex hovering at the same time off different coasts and haunting different islands. In the mean while captain Porter, though wrap ped in mystery and uncertainty himself, yet received frequent and accurate accounts of his enemies, from the various prizes which he had taken. Lieuten ant Downes, also, who had convoyed the prizes to Valparaiso, on his return, brought advices of the"], [135, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 121 expected arrival of commodore Hillyar in the Ph\u0153be frigate rating thirty-six guns accompanied by two. sloops of war. Glutted with spoil and havock, and sated with the easy and inglorious cap tures of merchantmen, captain Porter noAV felt eager for an opportunity to meet the enemy on equal terms, and to signalize his cruise by some brilliant achievement. Having been nearly a year at sea, he found that his ship Avould require some repairs, to enable her to face the foe ; he re paired, therefore, accompanied by several of his prizes, to the Island of Nooaheevah, one of the Washington group, discovered by a captain Ingra ham of Boston. Here he landed, took formal pos session of the island in the name of the government of the United States, and gave it the name of Madi son's Island. He found it large, populous and fer tile, abounding with the necessaries life ; the natives in the vicinity of the harbour which he had chosen received him in the most friendly manner, and supplied him Avith abundance of provisions. During his stay at this place he had several encoun ters with some hostile tribes on the island, whom he succeeded in reducing to subjection. Having calk ed and completely overhaled the ship, made for her a new set of water casks, and taken on board from the prizes provisions and stores for upwards of four months, he sailed for the coast of Chili on the 12th December, 1813. Previous to sailing he se cured the three prizes which had accompanied him, under the guns of a battery erected for their pro- 16"], [136, "122 NAVAL TEMPLE. section, and left them in charge of lieutenant Gamble of the marines and twenty-one men, with orders to proceed to Valparaiso after a certain period, i After cruising on the coast of Chili without suc cess, he proceeded to Valparaiso, in hopes of falling in with commodore Hillyar, or, if disappointed in this wish, of capturing some merchant ships said to be expected from England. While at anchor at this port, commodore Hillyar arrived, having long been searching in vain for the Essex, and almost despairing of ever meeting with her. Contrary to the expectations of captain Porter, however, com modore Hillyar, besides his own frigate, superior in itself to the Essex, was accompanied by the Cherub sloop of war, strongly armed and manned. These ships, having been sent out expressly to seek for the Essex, were in prime order and equipment, Avith picked creAvs, and hoisted flags bearing the motto \"God and country, British sailors' best rights : traitors offend both.\" This was in opposi tion to captain Porter's motto of \" Free trade and sailors' rights,\" and the latter part of it suggested doubtless, by errour industriously cherished, that our crews are chiefly composed of English seamen. In reply to this motto captain Porter hoisted at his mizzen, \" God, our country, and liberty : tyrants offend them.\" On entering the harbour the Ph\u0153be fell foul of the Essex in such manner as to lay her at the mercy of captain Porter ; out of respect, hoAvever, to the neutrality of the port, he did not take advantage of her exposed situation. This for-"], [137, "N.VVAL TEMPLE. 123 bearance was afterwards acknowledged by commo dore Hillyar, and he passed his word of honour to observe like conduct while they remained in port. They continued therefore, while in harbour and on shore, in the mutual exchange of courtesies and kind offices that should characterise the private inter course between civilized and generous enemies. And the crews of the respective ships often mingled together and passed nautical jokes and pleasantries from one to the other. On getting their provisions on board, the Ph\u0153be and Cherub went off the port, where they cruised for six weeks, rigorously blockading captain Porter. Their united force amounted to eighty-one guns and five hundred men, in addition to which they took on board the crew of an English letter of marque lying in port. The force of the Essex con sisted of but forty-six guns, all of which, excepting six long twelves, were twenty-two pound carron ades, only serviceable in close fighting. Her crew, having been much reduced by the manning of prizes, amounted to but tAvo hundred and fifty-five men. The Essex junior being only intended as a store ship, mounted ten eighteen pound carronades and ten short sixes Avith a complement of only sixty men. This vast superiority of force on the part of the enemy prevented all chance of encounter, on any thing like equal terms, unless by express covenant between the commanders. Captain Porter, there fore, endeavoured repeatedly to provoke a chal-"], [138, "124 NAVAL TEMPLE. Jenge, (the inferiority of his frigate to the Ph\u0153be not justifying him in making the challenge himself,) but without effect. He tried frequently also to bring the Ph\u0153be into single action ; but this commodore Hillyar warily avoided, and always kept his ships so close together as to frustrate captain Porter's attempts. Finding it impossible to bring the enemy to equal combat ; and fearing the arrival of additional force, which he understood was on the way, captain Por ter determined to put to sea the first opportunity that should present. A rendezvous was accordingly appointed for the Essex junior, and having ascer tained by repeated trials that the Essex was a supe rior sailer to either of the blockading ships, it was agreed that she should let the enemy chase her off; thereby giving the Essex junior an opportunity of escaping. On the next day, the 28th March, the wind came on to blow fresh from the southward, and the Essex parted her larboard cable and dragged her star board anchor directly out to sea. Not a moment was lost in getting sail on the ship; but perceiA' ing that the enemy was close in with the point forming the west side of the bay, and that there was a possibility of passing to windward, and es caping to sea by superior sailing, captain Porter. resolved to hazard the attempt. He accordingly took in his top-gallant-sails and braced up for the purpose, but most unfortunately on rounding the point a heavy squall struck the ship and carried"], [139, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 125 away her main-top-mast, precipitating the men who were aloft ihto the sea, who were drowned. Both ships now gave chase, and the crippled state of his ship left captain Porter no alternative but to en deavour to regain the port. Finding it impossible to get back to the common anchorage, he ran close into a small bay about three quarters of a mile to leeward of the battery, on the east of the harbour, and let go his anchor within pistol shot of the shore. Supposing the enemy would, as formerly, respect the neutrality of the place, he considered himself secure, and thought only of repairing the damages he had sustained. The wary and menacing ap proach of the hostile ships, however, displaying their motto flags and having jacks at all their masts' heads, soon showed him the real danger of his situa tion. With all possible despatch he got his ship ready for action, and endeavoured to get a spring on his cable, but had not succeeded, when, at fifty four minutes past three p. m. the enemy commenced an attack. At first the Ph\u0153be lay herself under his stern and the Cherub on his starboard bow ; but the latter soon finding herself exposed to a hot fire, bore up and ran under his stern also, where both ships kept up a severe and raking fire. Captain Porter suc ceeded three different times in getting springs on his cables, for the purpose of bringing his broadside to bear on the enemy, but they were as often shot away by the excessive fire to which he was exposed. He was obliged, therefore, to rely for defence"], [140, "126 NAVAL TEMPLE. against this tremendous attack merely on three long twelve pounders, which be had ran out of the stern ports ; and which were worked with such bravery and skill, as in half an hour to do great injury to both the enemy's ships, and induce them to hale off and repair damages. It was evidently the intention of commodore Hillyar to risk nothing from the daring courage of his antagonist, but to take the Essex at as cheap a rate as possible. All his ma n\u0153uvres were deliberate and wary; he saAv his antagonist completely at his mercy, and prepared to cut him up in the safest and surest manner. In the mean lime the situation of the Essex was gall ing and provoking in the extreme ; crippled and shattered, with many killed and wounded, she lay awaiting the convenience of the enemy, to renew the scene of slaughter, with scarce a hope of escape or revenge. Her brave crew, however, in place of being disheartened, were aroused to desperation, and by hoisting ensigns in their rigging, and jacks in different parts of the ship, evinced their defiance and determination to hold out to the last. The enemy having repaired his damages, hoav placed himself, Avith both his ships, on the starboard quarter of the Essex, out of reach of her carron ades, and Avhere her stern guns could not be brought to bear. Here he kept up a most destructive fire, Avhich it Avas not in captain Porter's power to return ; the latter, therefore, saAv no hope of injuring him Avithout getting under way and becoming the as sailant. From the mangled state of his rigging, he"], [141, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 127 could set no other sail than the flying jib ; this he caused to be hoisted, cut his cable, and ran doAvn on both ships, with an intention of laying the Ph\u0153be on board. For a short time he Avas enabled to close with the enemy, and the firing on both sides was tremendous. The decks of the Essex were strewed with dead, and her cockpit filled Avith wounded ; she had been several times on fire, and was in fact a perfect wreck ; still a feeble hope sprung up that she might be saved, in consequence of the Cherub being compelled to hale off by her crippled state ; she did not return to close action again, but kept up a dis tant firing with her long guns. The disabled state of the Essex, however, did not permit her to take advantage of this circumstance; for vvant of sail she was unable to keep at close quarters with the Ph\u0153be, who, edging ofT, chose the distance which best suited her long guns, and kept up a tremen dous fire, which made dreadful havock among our crew. Many of the guns of the Essex were ren dered useless, and many had their whole creAvs destroyed \u2014 they Avere manned from those that were disabled, and one gun in particular Avas three times manned ; fifteen men were slain at it in the course of the action, though the captain of it escaped with only a slight wound. Captain Porter now gave up all hope of closing Avith the enemy, but finding the wind favourable, determined to run his ship on shore, land the creAv, and destroy her. He had ap proached within musket shot of the shore, and had"], [142, "128 NAVAL TEMPLE. every prospect of succeeding, when, in an instant, the wind shifted from the land and drove her down upon the Ph\u0153be, exposing her again to a dreadful raking fire. The ship was now totally unmanage able ; yet as her head was toward the enemy, and he to leeAvard, captain Porter again perceived a faint hope of boarding. At this moment lieutenant Downes, of the Essex junior, came on board to re ceive orders, expecting that captain Porter would soon be a prisoner. His services could be of no avail in the deplorable state of the Essex, and find ing from the enemy's putting his helm up, that the last attempt at boarding would not succeed, captain Porter directed him, after he had been ten minutes on board, to return to his own ship, to be prepared for defending and destroying her in case of attack. He took with him several of the wounded, leaving three of his boat's crew on board to make room for them. The Cherub kept up a hot fire on him dur ing his return. The slaughter on board of the Essex now became horrible ; the enemy continued to rake her, while she was unable to bring a gun to bear in return. Still her commander, with an obstinacy that bordered on desperation, persisted in the une qual and almost hopeless conflict. Every expedient that a fertile and inventive mind could suggest Avas resorted to, in the forlorn hope that they might yet be enabled by some lucky chance to escape from the grasp of the foe. A halser was bent to the sheet anchor, and the anchor cut from the bows, to bring the ship's head round. This succeeded; the"], [143, "129 NAVAL TEMPLE. broadside of the Essex was again brought to bear; and as the enemy was much crippled and unable to hold his own, captain Porter thought she might drift out of gunshot before she discovered that he had anchored. The halser, however, unfortunately parted, and with it failed the last lingering hope of the Essex. The ship had taken fire several times during the action, but at this moment her situation was awful. She was on fire both forward and aft ; the flames were bursting up each hatchway ; a large quantity of poAvder beloAv exploded, and word Avas given that the fire was near the magazine. Thus surrounded by honours, Avithout any chance of saving the ship, captain Porter turned his attention to rescuing as many of his brave companions as pos sible. Finding his distance from the shore did not exceed three quarters of a mile, he hoped many would be able to save themselves should the ship blow up. His boats had been cut to pieces by the enemy's shot, but he advised such as could sAvim to jump overboard and make for shore. Some reached it \u2014 some were taken by the enemy, and some perished in the attempt ; but most of this loyal and gallant crew preferred sharing the fate of their ship and their commander. Those who remained on board now endeavoured to extinguish the flames, and having succeeded, went again to the guns and kept up a firing for a few minutes ; but the crew had by this time become so Aveakened that all further resistance Avas in vain. Captain Porter summoned a consultation of the 17"], [144, "130 NAVAL TEMPLE. officers of divisions, but Avas surprised to find only acting lieutenant Stephen Decatur M'Knight re maining ; of the others some had been killed, others knocked overboard, and others carried below drs abled by severe wounds. The accounts from every part of the ship were deplorable in the extreme; representing her in the most shattered and crippled condition, in imminent danger of sinking, and so croAvded Avith the wounded that even the birth deck could contain no more, and many Avere killed Avhile under the surgeon's hands. In the mean while the enemy, in consequence of the smoothness of the Avater and his secure distance, was enabled to keep up a deliberate and constant fire, aiming with cool ness and certainty as if firing at a target, and hitting the hull at every shot. At length, utterly despair ing of saving the ship, captain Porter was compelled, at twenty minutes past six p. m. to give the painful order to strike the colours. It is probable the enemy did not perceive that the ship had surrender ed, for he continued firing ; several men were killed and wounded in different parts of the ship, and cap tain Porter thinking he intended to show no quar ter, was about to rehoist his flag and to fight until he sunk, when the enemy desisted his attack ten minutes after the surrender. The loss of the Essex is a sufficient testimony of the desperate bravery with which she was defended. Out of two hundred and fifty -five men which com prised her creAV, fifty-eight were killed ; thirty-nine wounded severely ; tAventy-seven slightly ; and thir-"], [145, "131 NAVAL TEMPLE. ty-one missing, making in all one hundred and fifty four. She was completely cut to pieces, and so covered with the dead and dying, with mangled limbs, with brains and blood, and all the ghastly images of pain and death, that the officer Avho came on board to take possession of her, though accustom ed to scenes of slaughter, Avas struck with sicken ing horrour, and fainted at the shocking spectacle. Thousands of the inhabitants of Valparaiso were spectators of the battle, covering the neighbouring heights : for it was fought so near the shore that some of the shot even struck among the citizens, who, in the eagerness of their curiosity, had Aren tured down upon the beach. Touched by the for lorn situation of the Essex, and filled with admira tion at the unflagging spirit and persevering bravery of her commander and crew, a generous anxiety ran throughout the multitude for their fate : bursts of delight arose when, by any vicissitude of battle, or prompt expedient, a chance seemed to turn up in their favour ; and the eager spectators Avere seen to wring their hands, and uttered groans of sympathy, when the transient hope was defeated, and the gal lant little frigate once more became an unresisting object of deliberate slaughter. Though, from the distance and positions which the enemy chose, this battle was chiefly fought on our part by six twelve pounders only, yet great damage was done to the assailing ships. Their masts and yards were badly crippled, their hulls much cut up ; the Ph\u0153be, especially, received eighteen tAvelve"], [146, "132 Naval temple. pound shot beloAV her Avater line, some three feet under Avater. Their loss in killed and wounded Avas not ascertained, but must have been severe ; the first lieutenant of the Ph\u0153be was killed, and captain Tucker, of the Cherub, Avas seA'erely Avounded. It was with some difficulty that the Ph\u0153be and the Essex could be kept afloat until they anchored the next morning in the port of Valparaiso. Much indignation has been expressed against commodore Hillyar for his violation of the laws of nations, and of his private agreement Avith captain Porter, by attacking him in the neutral waters of Valparaiso. His cautious attack with a vastly superior force, on a crippled ship, which, relying on his forbearance, had placed herself in a most de fenceless situation, and Avhich for six Aveeks pre vious had offered him fair fight, on advantageous terms, though it may reflect great credit nn his prudence, yet certainly furnishes no triumph to a brave and generous mind. Captain Porter and his crew were paroled, and permitted to return to the United States in the Es sex junior, her armament being pre\\'iously taken out. On arriving off the port of New York, they Avere overhaled by the Saturn razee, the authority of commodore Hillyar to grant a passport was questioned, and the Essex junior detained. Cap tain Porter then told the boarding officer that he gave up his parole, and considered himself a prison er of Avar, and as such should use all means of escape. In consequence of this threat the Essex"], [147, "133 NAVAL TEMPLE* junior was ordered to remain all night under the lee of the Saturn, but the next morning captain Porter put off in his boat, though thirty miles from shore ; and, notwithstanding he was pursued by the Saturn, effected his escape, and landed safely on Long Island. His reception in the United States has been such as his great services and distinguished valour deserved. The various interesting and ro mantick rumours that had reached this country concerning him, during his cruise in the Pacifick, had excited the curiosity of the publick to see this modern Sinbad. On arriving in New York his car riage was surrounded by the populace, who took out the horses, and dragged him, with shouts and acclamations, to his lodgings. THE ALLIGATOR. Towards the latter part of January, 1814, the United States schooner Alligator, mounting eight or ten guns, with a complement of forty men, was attacked in Stono river (six miles south of the channel of Charleston, S. C.) by six boats from the enemy's squadron off the mouth of the river, having on board one hundred and forty men, and succeeded in beating them off, after a warm action of thirty minutes, in which the enemy suffered very severely. The loss on board the Alligator was two killed and tAVO Avounded. Great credit is due to her com-"], [148, "134 NAVAL TEMPLE. mander, sailing-master Dent, and crew, for defeat ing a force so greatly superior in numbers. The Alligator was afterwards lost in a severe gale, and tAArenty-1hree of her men droAvned. GRUISE OF COMMODORE RODGERS. On the 18th of February, commodore Rodgers arrived at Sandy Hook, off New York, after a cruise of seventy-five days, during which he cap tured a number of British merchant vessels, and narrowly escaped at different times, a very superior force of the enemy. PEACOCK AND EPERVIER. On the 29th of April, in latitude 27 47, longi tude 80 9, the United States sloop of war Peacock, captain Warrington, of twenty guns and one hun dred and sixty men, captured, after an action of forty-two minutes, the British brig Epervier of eighteen guns and one hundred and twenty-eight men, having on board one hundred and twenty thousand dollars in specie. The loss on board the Epervier Avas eight killed and thirteen wounded ; among the latter Avas her first lieutenant, Avho lost an arm and received a severe splinter wound on the"], [149, "135 NAVAL TEMPLE. hip. Not a man in the Peacock was killed, and only two wounded ; and the injury sustained by the vessel was so trifling that in fifteen minutes after the Epervier struck, she was ready for another action. When the enemy struck, he had five feet of wa ter in his hold, his main-top-mast was over the side, his main boom shot away, his foremast cut nearly in two and tottering, his bowsprit badly wounded, and forty-five shot holes in his hull, twenty of which were within a foot of his water line. By great ex ertions, the Epervier was got in sailing order in the course of the day. On the 1st of May, the Epervier arrived at Sa vannah ; and on the 4th, the Peacock reached the same place, after having been separated from her prize and chased for four or five days by a superior force of enemy's vessels. The Peacock shortly sailed again, and arrived at New York toward the latter part of October, from a cruise of one hundred and forty-seven days, hav ing made fourteen prizes, valued at four hundred and ninety-four thousand tAvo hundred and twenty two dollars ; twelve of the prizes were burnt or sunk, and two made cartels for prisoners,"], [150, "136 NAVAL TEMPLE. CRUISE OF THE WASP.\u2014 CAPTURE OF THE REINDEER. On the 1st of May, the United States sloop of war Wasp, of eighteen guns and one hundred and seventy-three men, captain Blakely commander, sailed from Portsmouth, N. H. on a cruise, and on the 28th of June, in latitude 48 36, longitude 1115, after having made several captures, she fell in with, engaged, and after an action of nineteen minutes, captured his Britannick majesty's sloop of war Reindeer, William Manners, esquire, commander. The Reindeer mounted sixteen twenty-four pound carronades, two long six or nine pounders, and a shifting twelve pound carronade, with a comple ment on board of one hundred and eighteen men. She was literally cut to pieces in a line with her ports ; her upper works, boats and spare spars were one complete wreck, and a breeze springing up the day after the action, her foremast went by the board ; when the prisoners having been taken on board the Wasp, she was set on fire and soon blew up. The loss on board the Reindeer was twenty three killed and forty-two wounded, her captain being among the former. On board the Wasp five were killed and twenty-one wounded. More than one half of the Avounded enemy were, in consequence of the severity and extent of their wounds, put on board a Portuguese brig and sent to England. \u2014 The"], [151, "137 NAVAL TEMPLE. loss of the Americans, although not as severe as that of the British, was owing, in a degree, to the prox imity of the tAvo vessels during the action, and the extreme smoothness of the sea, but chiefly in repel ling boarders. On the 8th of July, the Wasp put into L'Orient, France, after capturing an additional number of prizes, where she remained until the 27th of Au gust, when she again sailed on a cruise. On the 1st of September she fell in with the British sloop of war Avon, of twenty guns, commanded by cap tain Abuthnot, and after an action of forty-five minutes, compelled her to surrender, her crew being nearly all killed or wounded. The guns Avere then ordered to be secured, and a boat lower ed from the Wasp in order to take possession of the prize. In the act of lowering the boat, a second enemy's vessel was discovered astern and standing toAvards the Wasp. Captain Blakely immediately ordered his crew to their quarters, prepared every thing for action, and awaited her coming up. In a feAv minutes after, two additional sail were discover ed bearing doAvn upon the Wasp. Captain Blakely stood off with the expectation of drawing the first from its companions ; but in this he Avas disappoint ed. She continued to approach until she came close to the stern of the Wasp, when she haled by the wind, fired her broadside, (Avhich injured the Wasp but trifling,) and retraced her steps to join her consorts. Captain Blakely was now necessi tated to abandon the Avon, which had by this time 18"], [152, "138 NAVAL TEMPLE. become a total wreck, and which soon after sunk, the surviving part of her crew having barely time to escape to the other enemy's vessels. On board the Avon forty were killed and sixty wounded. The loss sustained by the Wasp was two killed and one Avounded. The Wasp aftenvards continued her cruise, making great havock among English merchant ves sels and privateers, destroying an immense amount of the enemy's property. From the 1st of May until the 20th of September, she had captured fifteen vessels, most of which she destroyed. LOSS OF THE PRESIDENT. On the 14th of January, the frigate President, the command of which had been assigned to com modore Decatur, sailed from New York on a cruise. Owing to a mistake of the pilots, the ship, in going out, grounded on the bar, Avhere she continued to strike heavy for an hour and a half. Several of her rudder braces being broken, and other material injury sustained, commodore Decatur thought it advisable to return to port, which, however, he was prevented from doing by the strong westerly Avinds. Having succeeded in forcing her over the bar, he shaped his course along the shore of Long Island for fifty miles, and then s. e. by e. At five o'clock,"], [153, "139 NAVAL TEMPLE. three ships were discovered ahead. The commo dore passed two miles to the northward of them. At daylight, he discovered four ships in chase, one on each quarter, and two astern, the leading ship being a razee, Avhich commenced a fire upon the President, but without effect. At meridian he found that he increased his distance from the razee ; but the next ship astern, Avhich Avas the Endymion, mounting fifty guns, twenty-four pounders, on the maindeck, had gained and continued to gain upon him considerably. All hands were occupied in lightening the ship by starting water, cutting away anchors, throwing overboard provisions, cables, spars, boats, and every article that could be got at, and keeping the sails wet from the royals down. At three o'clock the enemy was joined by a brig, and was coming up with the President rapidly. The Endymion had approached within gunshot, and commenced a fire with her bow guns, which was returned from the stern of the President. At five o'clock, she obtained a position on the starboard quarter, within half point blank shot, on which commodore Decatur could not bring either his stern or quarter guns to bear. He remained in this position for half an hour, hoping that the enemy would close Avith him on his broadside, in which case he had prepared his men to board. The enemy, hoAvever, kept his position, and every fire cut some of the sails and rigging of the President. It was noAv dusk, and commodore Decatur altered his course, for the purpose of bringing the enemy"], [154, "140 NAVAL TEMPLE. abeam ; and although their ships astern Avere draw ing up fast, he felt satisfied he should be able to throw his opponent out of the combat before they could come up ; and Avas not without hopes of es caping. The enemy, hoAvever, kept off at the same instant. They continued engaged, steering south, with steering sails set, two hours and a half, Avhen the Endymion was completely dismantled, and dropped entirely out of the action. The other ships of the squadron being in sight and almost Avithin gunshot, commodore Decatur was of course compelled to abandon her. He then resumed his former course, to avoid, if possible, the remainder of the squadron, which he continued till eleven o'clock. At this time two fresh ships of the enemy, the Pomone and Tenedos, came up. The Pomone opened her fire upon the larboard bow, within mus ket shot ; the Tenedos, about two cables length astern, taking a raking position on the quarter of the President. The other ships of -the squadron, except the Endymion, were within gunshot. Thus situated, with about one fifth of his crew killed and Avounded, his ship crippled, and more than a four fold force opposed to him, without a chance of escape left, commodore Decatur thought it his duty to surrender. The loss on board the President Avas twenty-four killed and fifty-five wounded. Among the former were lieutenants Babbit, Hamilton and Howell. The loss of the enemy was not ascertained. The Endymion had on board, in addition to her own"], [155, "141 NAVAL TEMPLE. crew, one lieutenant, one master's mate, and fifty seamen, belonging to the Saturn, and when the ac tion ceased, was left motionless and unmanageable, until she bent neAV sails, rove new rigging, and fished her spars ; nor did she join the squadron till six hours after the action, and three hours after the surrender of the President. Commodore Decatur, and a part of his crew were put on board the Endymion, and was carried to Bermuda. After remaining on the island a few days, he Avas paroled, and sailed for the United States in the British frigate Narcissus. The ships, composing the squadron in this action, were the Majestic, Endymion, Pomone, Tenedos, and Dispatch. In his letter to the secretary of the navy, commo dore Decatur says, \" It is with emotions of pride I bear testimony to the gallantry and steadiness of every officer and man I had the honour to com mand on this occasion : and I feel satisfied, that the fact of their having beaten a force equal to them selves, in the presence, and almost under the guns of so vastly superior a force, when, too, it was almost self-evident, that, whatever their exertions might be, they must ultimately be captured, will be taken as evidence of what they would have performed, had the force opposed to them been in any degree equal.\""], [156, "142 NAVAL TEMPLE. CAPTURE OF THE CYANE AND LEVANT. On the evening of the 20th February, captain Stewart, of the United States frigate Constitution, off the island of Madeira, fell in Avith his Britan nick majesty's ships of Avar Cyane and Levant, when a spirited action commenced. \u2014 In forty minutes the Cyane struck her colours, being much cut up, and the Levant endeavoured to escape. The Constitu tion, after manning the prize, pursued the Levant ; and in half an hour came up with her, Avhen she soon surrendered. The Levant mounted twenty-one guns, eighteen of which Avere thirty-two pound carronades, and her crew consisted of one hundred and sixty officers, seamen and marines, commanded by captain Doug lass. Her loss in killed was twenty-three, and wounded sixteen. The Cyane mounted thirty-four guns, (tAventy two thirty-two pound carronades, ten eighteen pound do. and tAvo long nine pounders,) and her erew consisted of one hundred and sixty-eight offi cers, seamen and marines, commanded by captain Falcon. Her loss in killed Avas tAvelve, and wounded tAventy-six. The Constitution received but little injury ; her loss in killed Avas three, and wounded tAvelve. On the 9th of March the Constitution Avith her tAvo prizes anchored off the Isle of May, (one of the Cape-de-Verd islands.) \u2014 On the 10th she got"], [157, "143 NAVAL TEMPLE. under Avay, and made sail for St. Jago, where she anchored. On the 12th, captain Stewart discovered three British frigates standing for Port Pray a ; and considering the little respect heretofore paid by British vessels to neutral waters, he deemed it ex pedient to get under Avay. Signals Avere according ly made for this purpose, when the Portuguese opened a fire upon captain Stewart from several of their batteries, and the British frigates discovering the movements of our vessels, gave immediate chase. After continuing the chase for three or four hours, they succeeded in separating the Levant from the other vessels, when she tacked and stood for the harbour, her commanding officer, lieutenant Ballard, hoping the neutrality of the port might protect him : but in this he was disappointed. For after anchoring in four fathom Avater, and within one hundred and fifty yards of the shore, he Avas wantonly attacked by the British frigates, (which had chased him in) when, finding all further resis tance vain, he was compelled to strike his colours. On the 8th of April, the Cyane, commanded by lieutenant Hoffman, arrived in safety at NeAv York ; and on the 15th of May captain Stewart arrived at the same place in the Constitution, after a cruise of about five months \u2014 having heard of the ratification of a treaty of peace between Great Britain and America about a fortnight previous to his arrival."], [158, "144 NAVAL TEMPLE. The following particulars of the capture of the Cyane and Levant, of the escape of the Constitution with one of them, and the subsequent recapture of the other by a British fleet, are given by captain Stewart, in his official letter, and may perhaps be more gratifying to the nautical reader, than our preceding brief relation. Minutes of the action between the United States frigate Constitu- tion and his majesty's ships Cyane and Levant, on the 20th February, 1815. Commences with light breezes from the east, and cloudy weather. At one p. m. discovered a sail two points on the larboard bow \u2014 hauled up, and made sail in chase. At a quarter past one, made the sail to be a ship ; at three quarters past one, dis covered another sail ahead ; made them out, at two, to be both ships, standing close hauled, with then starboard tacks on board ; at four, the weathermost ship made signals, and bore up for her consort, then about ten miles to leeward ; we bore up after her, and set lower top-mast, top-gallant and royal stud ding sails, in chase ; at half past four, carried away our main royal-mast; took in the sails, and got another prepared. At five, commenced firing on the chase from our two larboard boAV guns ; our shot falling short, ceased firing : at half past five, finding it impossible to prevent their junction, cleared ship for action, then about four miles from the tAvo ships ; and forty minutes past five, they passed within hail"], [159, "145 NAVAL TEMPLE. of each other, and hauled by the wind on the star board tack, hauled up their courses, and prepared to receive us : at forty-five minutes past five, they made all sail close hauled by the wind, in hopes of getting to windward of us: at fifty-five minutes past five, finding themselves disappointed in their object, and we were closing with them fast, they shortened sail, and formed on a line of wind, about half a cable's length of each other : at six, having them under command of our battery, hoisted our colours, Avhich was ansAvered by both ships hoisting English ensigns : at five minutes past six, ranged up on the starboard side of the sternmost ship, about three hundred yards distant, and commenced the action by broadsides, both ships returning our fire with great spirit for about fifteen minutes ; then the fire of the enemy beginning to slacken, and the great column of smoke collected under our lee, in duced us to cease our fire to ascertain their posi tions and conditions : in about three minutes, the smoke clearing away, we found ourselves abreast of the headmost ship, the sternmost ship luffed up for our larboard quarter ; we poured a broadside into the headmost ship, and then braced aback our main and mizzen-top-sails, and backed astern under cover of the smoke, abreast the sternmost ship, when the action was continued with spirit and considerable effect, until thirty-five minuses past six, when the enemy's fire again slackened, and we discovered the headmost bearing up ; filled our topsails, shot ahead, and gave her tAvo stern rakes; we then Is)"], [160, "146 NAVAL TEMPLE. discovered the sternmost ship wearing also ; wore ship immediately after her, and gave her a stern rake \u2014 she luffed to on our starboard boAvs, and gave us her larboard broadside : we ranged up on her larboard quarter, within hail, and were about to give her our starboard broadside, Avhen she struck her colours, fired a lee gun, and yielded. At fifty minutes past six, took possession of his majesty's ship Cyane, captain Gordon. Falcon, mounting thirty-four guns. At eight, filled aAvay after her consort, which was still in sight to leeAvard. At half past eight, found her standing towards us, with her starboard tacks close hauled, Avith top-gallant sails set, and colours flying. At five minutes past eight, ranged close along side to windward of her, on opposite tacks, and exchanged broadsides \u2014 wore immediately under her stern, and raked her with a broadside : she then croAvded all sail, and endea voured to escape by running \u2014 hauled on board our tacks, set spanker, and flying jib in chase. At half past nine, commenced firing on her from our star board boAv chaser ; gave her several shot, which cut her spars and rigging considerably. At ten, finding she could not escape, fired a gun, struck her colours, and yielded. We immediately took possession of his majesty's ship Levant, honourable captain George Douglass, mounting tAventy-one guns. At one a. m. the damages of our rigging Avere repaired, sails shifted, and the ship in fighting condition.\""], [161, "147 NAVAL TEMPLE. Minutes of the chase of the United States frigate Constitution, by an English squadron of three ships, from out the harbour of Porl Praya, island of St. Jago : \u2014 Commences with fresh breezes and thick foggy weather. At five minutes past twelve, discovered a large ship through the fog, standing in for Port Praya. At eight minutes past twelve, discovered two other large ships astern of her, also standing in for the port. From their general appearance sup posed them to be one of the enemy's squadrons, and from the little respect hitherto paid by them to neutral waters, I deemed it most prudent to put to sea. The signal was made to the Cyane and Le vant to get under Avay. At twelve minutes past tAvelve, with our topsails set, we cut our cable and got under way, (when the Portuguese opened a fire on us from several of their batteries on shore) the prize ships following our motions, and stood out of the harbour of Port Praya, close under East Point, passing the enemy's squadron about gunshot to windward of them ; crossed our top-gallant yards, and set foresail, mainsail, spanker, flying-jib and top gallant sails. The enemy seeing us under Avay, tacked ship and made all sail in chase of us. As far as we could judge of their rates, from the thick ness of the weather, supposed them two ships of the line and one frigate. At half past twelve, cut away the boats tOAving astern \u2014 first cutter and gig. At one p. m. found our sailing about equal with the ships on our lee quarter, but the frigate luffing up, gaining our wake, and rather dropping astern of us ;"], [162, "148 NAVAL TEMPLE. finding the Cyane dropping astern and to leeward, and the frigate gaining on her fast, I found it impos sible to save her' if she continued on the same course, Avithout having the Constitution brought to action by tlieir whole force. I made the signal at ten minutes past one, to her to tack ship, which was complied Avith. This man\u0153uvre, I conceived, Avould detach one of the enemy's ships in pursuit of her, while at the same time, from her position, she would be enabled to reach the anchorage at Port Praya, before the detached ship could come up with her; but if they did not tack after her, it would afford her an opportunity to double their rear, and make her escape before the Avind. They all continued in full chase of the Levant and this ship ; the ship on our lee quarter firing broadsides, by divisions \u2014 her shot falling short of us. At three, by our having dropped the Levant considerably, her situation became (from the position of the enemy's frigate) similar to the Cyane. It became necessary to separate also from the Levant, or risk this ship being brought to action to cover her. I made the signal at five minutes past three for her to tack, which Avas complied with. At twelve minutes past three, the whole of the enemy's squadron tacked in pursuit of the Levant, and gave up the pursuit of this ship. This sacrifice of the Levant became ne cessary for the preservation of the Constitution. Sail ing master Hixon, midshipman Varnum, one boat sAvain's mate,and twelve men, were absent on duty in the fifth cutter, to bring the cartel brig under- coir stern."], [163, "149 NAVAL TEMPLE. BLOCKADE OF CHESAPEAKE AND DELAWARE BAYS. The British government declared the Chesa peake and Delaware bays to be in a state of block ade. In the early part of the year, a squadron under the command of admiral Warren, was sent to the entrance of the Chesapeake to enforce this blockade. The first interesting event this blockade gave rise to, was the affair of the Lottery. This vessel mounted six guns, and had a crew of thirty-five men. In sailing out of the Chesapeake, in the month of February, she was attacked by nine large British boats, having on board two hundred and forty well armed men. She sustained their united attack upwards of an hour and a half, when the British succeeded in boarding her, and pulled down her colours. The loss of the British exceeded the number of the crew of the Lottery. On the 3d of April, the privateer Dolphin of Bal timore, was captured after a long and gallant resis tance, by a number of barges and launches, belong ing to the blockading squadron. The British finally succeeded in capturing her, by boarding and over powering her crew by superior numbers. About the middle of May, a party of the British blockading squadron, sailed up to the head of the Chesapeake bay, where they captured and destroy ed a number of small vessels."], [164, "150 NAVAL TEMPLE. About the commencement of May, a large party of British marines and sailors, under the command of rear admiral Cockburn, successfully attacked the villages of Frenchtown, Havre-de-grace, George toAvn and Fredericktown. These places were sit uated near the head of the Chesapeake, and con tained but few inhabitants. They of course could make but little resistance against a numerous body of assailants. The destruction committed by the British in these places was Avanton in the extreme. The houses Avere set on fire. The furniture and other property of the inhabitants were either des troyed or conveyed on board their vessels. The squadron soon after returned down the Chesapeake. On the' 20th of June, commodore Cassin fitted out an expedition against some of the blockading frigates then in the vicinity of Crany Island. Fif teen gun boats Avere selected for this purpose, and put under the command of captain Tarbell. The attack was commenced from the gun boats upon a frigate about three quarters of a mile distant. Two other British frigates were in sight. The frigate sustained considerable injury, and would have been captured by the gun boats had not a breeze sprung up Avhich enabled the other tAvo vessels to come to her assistance. The action however continued an hour and a half Avith the three frigates. Only one American was killed, and some others slightly Avounded. On the 22d of June, about three thousand British attempted to land on Crany Island, but were"], [165, "151 NAVAL TEMPLE. repulsed. Three of their barges were sunk : one of them, belonging to admiral Warren's ship had seventy-five men in her, the greater part of whom were drowned ; a number of prisoners Avere taken. Many of the enemy also deserted. The American troops on the island consisted of about five hundred land troops under the command of lieutenant-colonel Beaty ; and one hundred and fifty marines, and sailors, under the command of lieutenants Neale, Shubrick, Saunders, and Brackenridge. On the 25th of June, about two thousand five hundred British attacked the toAvn of Hampton. The American force stationed there amounted to about four hundred, under the command of major Crutchfield. This small body of Americans op posed the very superior British force, with the utmost gallantry for a considerable time, Avhen, overcome by numbers, they retreated, and the Brit ish took possession of Hampton, where the most inhuman and shocking acts were committed by them. Several of the defenceless and unfortunate females that remained in the place suffered every indecency and violence. Property to a large amount was most wantonly destroyed. On the 14th of July the United States schooner Asp, of three guns and twenty-one men, in the Chesapeake bay, being attacked by several British vessels, ran up a creek, whither she Avas pursued by three boats, well manned and armed ; but the assail ants were soon compelled to retreat. After the lapse of an hour, the Asp was again attacked by five"], [166, "152 NAVAL TEMPLE. boats, the crews of which succeeded in boarding her. The crew of the Asp retreated on shore. The British set fire to the vessel and left her. The fire however was extinguished by the Americans. The loss of the latter in killed and wounded amounted to ten. On the 18th of July, an attempt was made in the Chesapeake bay, to blow up the Plantaganet, a seventy-four, by means of a torpedo. Mr. Mix, the projector of the scheme, had approached Avithin forty fathoms of her, and dropped the torpedo ; when he was hailed by one of the British guard boats. He instantly drew his machine into the boat and escaped. On the following night he made a second attempt, but was again discovered. In the night of the 20th, he made a third attempt, and got within fifteen yards of the ship's boAV, and directly under her jib-boom, where he continued fifteen minutes making preparations, when a sentinel from the forecastle hailed \" Boat ahoy.\" The sentinel not being answered, fired his musket at the now retreating adventurer, to which a rapid discharge of small arms succeeded. Blue lights were resort ed to in order to find out the position of the boat, but failed. Rockets were then throAvn which il lumined the water to a considerable extent, and discovered the boat. A heavy discharge of cannon immediately commenced. The Plantaganet slip ped her cable, and made some sail, Avhile her boats were sent in pursuit. But the daring American escaped unhurt, Unsuccessful attempts Avere made"], [167, "153 NAVAL TEMPLE. the three following nights. But on the 24th Mr. Mix took his position within one hundred yards of the Plantaganet, and in a direction Avith her lar board bow. The machine Avas dropped into the water, and the same moment the sentinel cried \"All's well :\" the tide swept it toAvards the vessel, but it exploded a few seconds too soon. A column of Avater fifty feet in circumference was throAvn up thirty or forty feet. Its appearance Avas a vivid red, tinged with purple at the sides. The summit of the column burst Avith a tremendous explosion, and fell on the deck of the Plantaganet in torrents, while she rolled into the yawning chasm beloAv, and nearly upset. She however received but little injury. In the month of July, the blockading squadron again sailed up the Chesapeake and entered the Potomac : they however effected nothing. Soon after returning out of the river they sailed toAvard the head of the Chesapeake. They landed on Kent Island, where they remained for some time, when they again returned down the bay. On the 6th of April the blockading squadron in the Delaware bay commenced a cannonade on LeAv istown, the inhabitants of Avhich had refused com plying with an order of the English commodore, to supply the squadron with provisions. The cannon ade lasted about twenty-two hours : a number of eighteen and thirty-two pound shot were fired, likewise shells and Congreve rockets; but pro duced little or no effect \u2014 not a life Avas lost. The 20"], [168, "154 NAVAL TEMPLE. inhabitants of the place were prompt in repelling every attempt to land. On the 27th of July, one of the United States gun boats was captured in the Delaware by a supe rior force, after a very gallant defence, in which the British had seven men killed and twelve wounded.* GUN BOAT ACTION. On the 19th of May, commodore Lewis, com manding the United States flotilla on the New York station, discovered the enemy in pursuit of a brig under American colours, standing for Sandy Hook; when he ordered a detachment of eleven gun boats to proceed to sea and pass between the chase and the enemy, by which means to bring him to action, and give opportunity to the chase to es cape \u2014 all which was effected ; and the enemy, after receiving the fire of the boats bore away. On the 23d, commodore Lewis engaged the enemy before New London, and opened a passage for forty sail of coasting vessels : the action lasted three hours, in which the flotilla suffered very little, and night coming on, the action ceased. The enemy's force consisted of two ships and a sloop of Avar, and from appearance suffered severely, as he was umvilling to reneAv the action next morning. * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 194 \u2014 197."], [169, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 155 EVENTS ON LAKE ERIE. On the morning of the 8th of October, 1812, tAvo British vessels, the Detroit and the Caledonia, came down Lake Erie, and anchored under the guns of the British fort Erie. Lieutenant Elliot, of the United States navy, who, at that time superintended the naval affairs on lake Erie, determined to attack, and if possible, to possess himself of them. About this time, a number of seamen were march ing from the sea shore to the lake. Early the day before the intended attack, he despatched a mes senger to hasten them forward. They arrived about twelve o'clock ; but he discovered that they had only twenty pistols, and neither cutlasses nor battle axes. On application to general Smyth, he was supplied with a few arms : and about fifty men were detached from the regulars, armed with mus kets. By four o'clock in the afternoon, lieutenant Elliot had his men selected and stationed in two boats, fifty in each. At one o'clock on the following morning, he put off from the mouth of Buffalo creek, under very disadvantageous circumstances, his men having scarcely had time to refresh them selves after a fatiguing march of five hundred miles. At three o'clock he came along side the British vessels. In the space often minutes he got possession of them, had secured the crews as prison-"], [170, "156 NAVAL TEMPLE. ers, and had them under Avay. The wind, unfor tunately, was not sufficiently strong to carry them against a rapid current into the lake, Avhere, he Avas informed, another vessel lay at anchor. He was obliged in running doAvn the river, to pass the Brit ish forts, under a heavy fire of round, grape and cannister shot, from a number of pieces of heavy ordnance, and several pieces of flying artillery. Lieutenant Elliot was compelled to anchor at a distance of about four hundred yards from tAvo of then- batteries. Aster the discharge of the first gun he hailed the British officer, and observed to him, that if another gun were fired he would bring the prisoners on deck and expose them to the same fate with the Americans. But, notwithstanding they continued to keep up a constant and destructive fire, a moment's reflection determined him not to com mit an act of such barbarity. The Caledonia had been beached in as safe a position as circumstances Avould admit of, under one of the American bat teries at Black Rock. Lieutenant Elliot noAv brought all the guns of his vessel on her side next the enemy, and a fire was kept up until all his ammunition was expended. During the contest he endeavoured to get the De troit on the American side, but did not succeed. He then determined to drift down the river, out of reach of the British batteries, and make a stand against their flying artillery. He accordingly or dered the cable to be cut, and made sail with a very light breeze. At this moment he discovered"], [171, "157 NAVAL TEMPLE. that his pilot had abandoned him. He dropped astern for about ten minutes, when he was brought up on Squaw island, near the American shore. A boat Avith prisoners was sent on shore ; but, owing to the difficulty it met with, did not return. He, however, Avith the remainder of the prisoners and crew, succeeded in getting on shore. About eleven o'clock next morning, a company of British regulars from fort Erie, boarded the De troit, to destroy the military stores with Avhich she was principally laden. But they Avere dislodged by a detachment of volunteers under the command of major Cyrenus Chapin. About three o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, the British a second time attempted to board the Detroit ; but were again repulsed. The Detroit mounted six long six pounders, and had a crew of fifty-six men. About thirty Ameri can prisoners were on board her. She was burnt by the Americans after they had taken the greater part of the stores out of her. The Caledonia mounted two small guns, and had a crew of twelve men. She had on board a cargo of furs, estimated at about one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. In March 1813, captain Perry arrived at the port of Erie, to take command of the fleet there fitting out.

At fifteen minutes before twelve, the British com menced firing : and at five minutes before twelve, the action commenced on the part of the Americans. As the fire of the British, OAving to their long guns, was very severe upon the Americans, and Was prin cipally directed at the LaAvrence, commodore Per ry resolved to close with them : he accordingly made sail, and ordered the other vessels to follow. Every brace and bowline of the LaAvrence being shot away, she became unmanageable, notAvith stahding the great exertions of the sailing master. In this situation she sustained the action, within cannister distance, upwards of two hours, until every gun was rendered useless, and the greater part of her crew either killed or Avounded. After a display of skill and gallantry, which, alone, would have been sufficient to have immortal ized commodore Perry\u2014 after defending his vessel against a far superior' force, to the very last ex tremity, this illustrious hero, at a critical moment, when, to almost any other mind, the contest would have appeared hopeless, resolved to save his coun try's honour, or perish in the attempt. He there fore quitted the Lawrence in an open boat, and rowed off for the Niagara, to make one more dis play of his heroism and talents. In his passage, there were no less than three broadsides fired at him by the British vessels, which he passed. Heaven interposed its protecting arm. He escaped the apparently inevitable destruction. He reached the Niagara in safety, and a breeze springing up."], [176, "160 NAVAL TEMPLE. enabled captain Elliot, who commanded that vessel, to bring her into close action in a very gallant man ner. Captain Elliot anticipated the commodore's desires by volunteering to bring the schooners, which had, by the lightness of the Avind, been kept astern, into close action. Some time after commo dore Perry had left the Lawrence her flag Avas loAvered ; for having been sok long exposed to nearly the whole fire of the British fleet, she was almost cut to pieces ; and the chief part of her creAv dis abled, only eight men remaining capable of doing duty. The British however Avere not in a state to take possession of her, and circumstances soon per mitted her flag to be again hoisted. ' At forty-five minutes past two, the signal was made for close ac tion. As the Niagara was very little injured, com modore Perry determined to pass tb \u00bbugh the enemy's line with her. He accordingly bore up, and passed ahead of their two ships and a brig, giving a raking fire to them from his larboard side, at half pistol shot distance. The smaller vessels Avere by this time Avithin grape and cannister dis tance, under the direction of captain Elliot. The severe and well directed fire from them and the Niagara, forced the two ships, the brig, and a schooner- to surrender. A sloop and schooner at tempted to escape, but were overtaken and cap tured. The Lawrence was so completely cut up, that after the action, she was sent to Erie to be dis mantled. Lieutenant Yarnell, upon Avhom the"], [177, "mJis-TTlL.ia .

Lieutenant Brooke of the marines, and midshipman Saul, Avere both killed on board the Lawrence. As the surgeon of this vessel was stooping, in the act of dressing or examining a wound, a ball passed through the ship a feAv inches from his head, which, had it been erect must have been taken off. Mr. Hambleton, purser, distinguished himself, and towards the close of the action was severely wounded. On board the Niagara, lieutenants Smith and Ed wards and midshipman Webster behaved in a very handsome manner. Captain Brevoort of the army, who, with the men under his command, had volun teered, to/tict as marines, did great execution with his musketry. Lieutenant Turner, who command ed the Caledonia, brought his vessel into action in the most gallant style. The Ariel, lieutenant Packet, and Scorpion, sailing master Champlin, got early into the action, and were of great service. The purser Magrath performed essential service. Cap tain Elliot particularly distinguished himself by his exertion and skill. The following is an estimate of the killed and wounded on board the American fleet. Killed. Wounded. Total.

The rejoicing at this victory in the United States, was extremely great. All the principal towns were illuminated.* EVENTS ON LAKE ONTARIO. For a long time previous to the war, the British had been actively employed in equipping vessels of war on lake Ontario. On the 19th of July, 1812, soon after the declaration of war reach ed Sackett's harbour, lieutenant Woolsey, of the American brig Oneida, then lying in Sackett's har bour, discovered from the mast head five sail of British armed vessels, namely, the Royal George, of tAventy-four guns; the Prince Regent, a new * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 217 \u2014 222."], [181, "163 NAVAL TEMPLE. ship carrying upwards of twenty guns, the Earl Moira of twenty, the Seneca of eight, the other unknown. They were about, five leagues distant, beating up for the harbour with the wind ahead. The troops were immediately called to arms and despatches sent for the troops in the vicinty, who assembled, to the amount of nearly three thousand. Soon after sunrise the Prince Regent brought to, and captured the custom house boat, about seven miles from the harbour. The creAv of the boat were set on shore, with a message to colonel Belle yer, the commandant at the harbour, demanding the surrender of the Oneida, and the late British schooner- Nelson, seized for a breach of the revenue laws, and then fitting out as an armed vessel. In case of refusal, the British threatened to burn the village, and lay the inhabitants under contribution. Soon after this lieutenant Woolsey left the har bour in the Oneida, and ran down within a league of the British. But he soon returned, and moored his vessel in a line with a land battery lately erect ed. Lieutenant Woolsey then left his vessel, in order to direct the guns of the land battery. By this time the British fleet had arrived within gun shot. The Royal George, as flag ship, was ahead. A brisk firing commenced on both sides, and con tinued upAvards of two hours. The Royal George and Prince Regent were much injured. As the former was veering to give a broadside, a shot from an American thirty-two pounder, was observed to strike her and completely rake her. Soon after"], [182, "164 NAVAL TEMPLE. this the squadron bore away for Kingston. None of the Americans Avere injured. On the 31 st of July, the Julia, carrying three guns, Avas attacked by the British armed vessels Earl Moira, of sixteen guns, and the Duke of Glou cester of ten, at the entrance of the St. Lawrence, and beat them both off. In September, captain Isaac Chauncey was ap pointed to command the American fleet on lake Ontario, then lying in Sackett's harbour, Avhere he arrived in the month of October. In the early part of November, he sailed with his fleet from Sackett's harbour: the aggregate of guns of the American vessels amounted to forty, their crews to four hun dred and thirty men ; that of the British to one hundred and eight guns, and their crews to eight hundred and ninety men. On the 8th, commodore Chauncey fell in with the Royal George, and chased her into Quinte Bay; Avhere he lost sight of her in the night ; but on the morning of the 9th, she was perceived lying in Kingston channel. She was immediately followed into the harbour of Kingston. He there engaged her, Avhile exposed to the fire of the land batteries, for upwards of an hour and a quarter. Night coming on, he haled off with the intention of renew ing the attack next morning ; but this the weather prevented. On the 10th, the commodore fell in with the Governor Simcoe, which however succeeded in escaping into the harbour of Kingston.

The frigate General Wolfe 36 Ship Royal George 22 Prince Regent 16 Brig Earl Moira 12 Seven schooners of from four to eight guns each. On the 25th of April the American fleet, under commodore Chauncey, left Sackett's harbour for the purpose of conveying the expedition, under the command of major general Dearborn, against the British post at York. At this place the fleet ar rived on the 27th. The landing of the troops was covered in a masterly manner by the commodore. The Americans succeeded in their attack upon the town ; but unfortunately, the ever to be lamented brigadier general Pike, Avas killed by explosion. A midshipman and some seamen of the fleet were killed. Commodore Chauncey, after having returned to Sackett's harbour from York, again sailed, on the 22d of May, for the purpose of co-operating in the reduction of the British fort George, which was attacked on the 28th. The vessels of the American squadron were judiciously stationed to cover the landing of the troops, and to silence the land bat teries of the British ; in the latter they soon suc ceeded ; Avhen a landing was effected, and the fort taken. Captain Perry had come down from lake Erie, and was in this engagement. He rendered particu lar service to the commodore by assisting in arrang-"], [185, "167 NAVAL TEMPLE. ing and superintending she debarkation of the troops. On board the fleet only one man was killed, and two Avounded. On the 29th of May, during the absence of the American flees, the British fleet, consisting of the Wolfe, Royal George, Prince Regent, Earl Moira, two armed schooners, and a number of gun boats, with a detachment of the British army, from Kings ton, attacked Sackett's harbour ; they Avere ho\\A' ever gallantly repulsed by the troops under the command of brigadier general Brown. A few days after this affair the American fleet returned to Sackett's harbour. In the latter part of July, commodore Chauncey left Sackett's harbour with his fleet, and on the 27th of the same month arrived off Niagara. Having there taken about two hundred and fifty infantry on board, he set sail. It had been resolved to attack an encampment of the British; but the latter being in greater force than had been supposed, the attempt was abandoned ; and the fleet proceeded to York, Avhere the marines and soldiers Avere landed, under colonel Scott. A very considerable quantity of British stores were either destroyed or conveyed on board the fleet. The barracks and publick store houses were burnt. The fleet then returned to Niagara. On the 7th of August at daylight, the British fleet, consisting of two ships, two brigs, and two large schooners, Avere discovered bearing w. n. w. Thev were about five or six miles distant, and the"], [186, "168 NAVAL TEMPLE. wind at west. Commodore Chauncey, having pass ed the leeward of the British line, and abreast of their van ship, the Wolfe, hoisted American colours ; and fired a feAv guns to ascertain whether the British Vessels could be reached by his shot. But discover ing that they fell short, he wore and haled upon a wind on the starboard tack. The rearmost of the American schooners was then about six miles astern. The British Avore in succession ; and haled upon a wind on the same tack ; but perceiving the Ameri cans would be enabled to weather them upon the next tack, they tacked, and made all sail to the northward. As soon as the rear vessels of the American squadron could reach the wake of the British, they tacked, and made all sail in chase. In the afternoon, the Avind became very light, and towards night a calm succeeded. The American schooners used their sweeps all the afternoon, in endeavours to close with the British, but without success. Late in the afternoon commodore Chaun cey made the signal of recall, and formed in close order. During the night, the wind was from the westward ; and after midnight squally. All hands were kept at quarters, and the vessels beat to Avind ward, in expectation of gaining the wind of the British. During the night the tAvo best American schooners Avere upset, in a heavy squall of Avind, and sunk. Only sixteen person Avere saved from them ; all the rest perished. The names of the schooners were the Hamilton and Scourge, mount ing together nineteen guns. This accident gave"], [187, "169 NAVAL TEMPLE. the British a decided superiority. Commodore Chauncey expected the British would take advan tage of this superiority ; and the more so as by a change of Avind they were brought right to wind ward of him. He accordingly formed his line upon the larboard tack, and hove to. Soon after the British bore up and set studding sails, apparent ly with the intention of bringing the Americans to action. When they had approached Avithin four miles, they brought to on the starboard tack. The Americans then wore, and brought to, on the same tack. Commodore Chauncey perceiving the Brit ish did not intend bringing him to action, edged away towards the shore, in order to take advantage of the land breeze in the afternoon. It soon after became calm, when he directed his schooners to sweep up and engage the British. About noon a light breeze blew from the eastward. The commo dore then took the Oneida in tow, and made sail towards the British. When the van of the Ameri can schooners was within one and a half or tAvo miles of the rear of the British, the Avind shifted to the westward, Avhich again brought the latter to windward; when they bore up to the American schooners in order to cut them off, before they could be rejoined by commodore Chauncey. But the schooners succeeded in returning to their sta tion. The British being thus foiled in their attempt upon the schooners, haled their wind, and hove to. The weather becoming very squally, commodore Chauncey resolved to run in toAvards Niagara. 22"], [188, "170 NAVAL TEMPLE. The crews of the squadron Avere nearly forty-eight hours at quarters. A detachment of one hundred and fifty soldiers was received on board the Ameri can fleet from Niagara, to act as marines. On the fol lowing morning the British fleet was discovered bear ing north. The American commodore immediately Aveighed anchor, and stood for them. The winds were light and variable, and by twelve o'clock Avere quite calm. At five, a fresh breeze blew from the north ; the British fleet then bearing north, about four or five leagues distant. The vessels of the American fleet wore in succession, and haled upon a wind on the larboard tack. At sunset, the British bore n. w. by n. on the starboard tack. The wind changing towards the Avestward, the American com modore stood to the nortliAvard all night in order to gain the north shore. At daybreak he tacked to the AvestAvard, the wind having then changed to N. n. w. Soon after which he discovered the British fleet, bearing s. w.

At six, the Americans formed in line Avithin four miles of the British ; the wind being then very light. At seven, the wind changed to & w. and blew a fresh breeze. This placed the Brit ish to AvindAvard. The American commodore then tacked, and haled upon a wind on the larboard tack, under easy sail, the British standing after him. At nine in the evening, the British Avere within double gun shot of the rear of the Americans. They then wore to the southward. Commodore Chauncey stood to the north under easy sail, with his fleet formed in tAvo lines : a part of the schooners formed the Aveather line. They Avere ordered to commence the fire upon the British, as soon as the shot of the latter should take effect ; and, as they approached, to edge down upon the American line to leeward, pass through the intervals, and form to leeward. At half past ten, the British tacked, and stood aster the Americans. At eleven o'clock the rear of the American line opened a brisk fire upon the British, and in the course of fifteen minutes the fire became general along the Aveather line of the Americans. At half past eleven this line bore up, and passed to leeAvard, except the Growler and Julia. These two vessels tacked to the south, which brought the Brit ish between them and their commodore. The lat ter filled his main-topsail, and edged aAvay tAvo points to lead the British doAvn ; this he did in order to engage them to greater advantage, and to lead them from the GroAvler and Julia. They however kept their wind until they separated these two last"], [190, "172 NAVAL TEMPLE. mentioned vessels from the rest of the American squadron. As they passed the General Pike, a few shots were exchanged without doing any injury. While the British were in chase of the two schoon ers, the commodore tacked and stood aster them until midnight, when he Avas forced to give over the pursuit to rejoin his squadron, then to leeward. Their line was now formed on the starboard tack. The firing continued between the two American schooners and the British fleet until one o'clock, when the former were captured. Soon after this, the American fleet being nearly destitute of provi sions, returned to Sackett's harbour. During a cruise in the early part of September, commodore Chauncey fell in with the British fleet, and chased them all round the lake, when they put into Amherst bay, after having received considera ble injury from the fire of the Americans. This bay was so little known to the American pilots, that they were unwilling to take the fleet in. Sir James Yeo, commander of the British fleet, had a superiority over the American commodore, both in guns and men. His vessel also sailed better than the American. Commodore Chauncey blockaded the British fleet in Amherst bay for four days, when the wind bloAving heavy from the westAvard, they succeeded in getting into Kingston : upon which the com modore returned to Sackett's harbour, where he remained only a few hours, and on the 18th of September sailed for Niagara, where he arrived on the 24th."], [191, "173 NAVAL TEMPLE. Commodore Chauncey having ascertained that the British squadron was in York bay, sailed from Niagara. On the 27th, in the evening, owing to the extreme darkness of the night a part of his squadron separated, and did not join him until next morning. On the same day, the British fleet was discovered under way in York bay. The Ameri can squadron sailed for them with three schooners in tow. But on the British perceiving the design of the Americans to engage them, they tacked, and stood out of the bay, the wind being then at east. The American commodore formed his line, and ran doAvn for their centre. As soon, however, as he had approached Avithin three miles, they made all sail to the southward. The vessels of the American squadron wore in succession, and stood on the same tack with the British, and edged down gradually in order to close. At ten, past meridian, the British perceiving the Americans closing fast with them, and that they must either risk an action, or suffer their two rear vessels to be cut off, they tacked in succession, beginning at the van, hoisted their colours, and commenced a well directed fire at the Pike. This they did with a view to cover their rear; and, while passing to leeward, to attack the rear of the Americans. This commodore Chaun cey frustrated by bearing up in succession, with the line preserved, for the centre of the British, as soon as their leading ship, the Wolfe, had passed the centre of her line, and was abeam of the American. This man\u0153uvre not only covered the American"], [192, "174 NAVAL TEMPLE. rear, but also threAV the British in confusion. They immediately bore away ; but the Americans had closed so near as to be enabled to bring their guns to bear Avith effect, and in twenty minutes after, the main and mizzen-topmast, and the main yard of the British frigate Wolfe, was shot aAvay. This vessel immediately put before the wind, with all sail set upon her foremast. The American commodore made signal for the fleet to crowd all sail in pursuit : but as the Wolfe kept right before the Avind, she was enabled to outsail the American squadron, and experienced no retardment from the loss of her main and mizzen-topmast. The Americans con- tinued the chase until near three o'clock. The Pike, Avith the Asp in tow, kept within point blank shot of the British during the chase, and sustained the Avhole of their fire. Prudence forbade any fur- ther pursuit on the part of the Americans. The Pike Avas much injured, oAving to her being so long exposed to the fire of the Avhole British fleet. The most serious injury, hoAvever, she received from the bursting of a gun, Avhich killed and wounded twenty-tAVO men. The Governor Tompkins lost her foremast. The American fleet returned to Niagara. On the 2d of October, commodore Chauncey again proceeded in quest of the British fleet. He discovered them steering a course for Niagara, with studding sails, and all sails set, the wind being from the south and westward. The commodore made all sail in chase, but as soon as his vessels Avere dis-"], [193, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 175 covered by the British, they took in studding sails and haled upon a Avind to the westward, and made all sail from the Americans. The wind being light all day, little progress was made against the current. By sundown, the British were off Twenty Mile Creek, and had got a considerable distance from the Americans. At daylight, the British were perceived at anchor ; but as soon as they saAv the American squadron, they weighed and made all sail to the west. The wind Avas from south to southwest and squally. The American commodore made all sail in chase, and continued it the Avhole day. At sun down, the British could scarcely be perceived from the mast head of the American vessels. On the fol lowing morning the British fleet was out of sight. Commodore Chauncey then steered for the Ducks, with a vieAv of intercepting the British fleet on its return, should it have gone down the lake. The wind increased to a strong gale from the northward and westward, and continued during the whole day. At three o'clock in the afternoon of the 5th, seven sail were discovered near the False Ducks. Sail was immediately made in chase by the American commodore, who took them for the British fleet. But in the course of an hour he ascertained them to be sloops and schooners. Signal was made by the commodore for the Sylph and Lady of the Lake to cast off the vessels they had in toAv, and chase N. e. Soon after this the British Avere perceived separating on different tacks. The Governor Tompkins was now cast off' by the Pike, and the commodore made"], [194, "176 NAVAL TEMPLE. all sail in chase with her, having left the American squadron in charge of captain Crane. At five o'clock in the afternoon the British set fire to one of their gun vessels that did not sail well, after hav ing taken out her people. At sundoAvn, and oppo site the Real Ducks, the Hamilton, Constance,* and Mary-Ann, struck to the Americans. The Sylph soon after captured the Drummond. The Lady Gore ran into the Ducks, but the Sylph being left to watch her, she was captured early the next morning. The only British vessel that escaped was the Enterprize, a small schooner. The British vessels captured were gun vessels mounting from one to three guns each. They were transporting troops to Kingston. The number of prisoners amounted to two hundred and sixty-four, of whom two hundred and twenty-two were soldiers.

EVENTS ON LAKE CHAMPLAIN. During the summer of the year 1812, prepara tions were made on lake Champlain to oppose the naval force that might be sent bv the British from Isle-au-Noix. Nothing very interesting occurred until the 3d of June, 1813. In consequence of some British gun boats having appeared on the American side of the line, the GroAvler and Eagle sailed from Plattsburgh on the 2d of June, under the command of lieuten- ant Smith, with the intention of attacking them. At dark on the same day, they arrived within a mile of the boundary line. On the following morning, at daybreak, three British gun boats were discovered, to which the American vessels immediately gave chase. But the wind being south, they unfortu- nately ran so far into the narrow channel, that they found it difficult to return. The Eagle not being sufficiently strong for her weight of metal, became unmanageable, and sunk in shoal water : her crew were hoAvever saved. The Growler continued en- gaged with a number of British gun boats until the Eagle went down, when she Avas compelled to yield to a superior force ; the action continued above four hdurs. The shores were lined with British soldiers, who from the narrowness of the channel were enabled to do considerable execution. 23"], [196, "178 NAVAL TEMPLE. About the commencement of August the British in two large sloops of war, three gun boats, and about forty batteaux full of troops crossed the line.

Sir, \u2014 J have the honour to give you the particu lars of the action which took place on the 11th instant on this lake. . For several days the enemy were on their way to Plattsburgh by land and water ; and it being well understood that an attack would be made at the same time by their land and naval forces, I de termined to await at anchor the approach of the latter. At eight, a. m. the look-out boat announced the approach of the enemy. At nine he anchored in a line ahead, at about three hundred yards distance from my line ; his ship opposed to the Saratoga, his brig to the Eagle, captain Robert Henley, his gal leys (thirteen in number) to the schooner, sloop, and a division of our galleys. Our remaining gal leys with the Saratoga and Eagle. In this situation, the whole force on both sides became engaged ; the Saratoga suffered much from the heavy fire of the Confiance : I could perceive, at the same time, however, that our fire was very destructive to her. The Ticonderoga, lieutenant commandant Cassin, gallantly sustained her full share of the action. At half past ten o'clock, the Eagle, not being able to bring her guns to bear, cut her cable and anchored in a more eligible posi tion, between my ship and the Ticonderoga, where"], [200, "180 NAVAL TEMPLE. she very much annoyed the enemy, but unfortu nately leaving me exposed to a galling fire from the enemy's brig. Our guns, on the starboard side, being nearly all dismounted, or not manageable, a stern anchor was let go, the bower cable cut, and the ship Avinded Avith a fresh broadside on the enemy's ship, which soon after surrendered. Our broadside Avas then sprung to bear on the brig, which surrendered in about fifteen minutes after. The* sloop that was opposed to the Eagle, had struck some time before, and drifted do\\An the line ; the sloop which Avas with their galleys having struck also. Three of their galleys are said to be sunk, and the others pulled off. Our galleys Avere about obeying with alacrity the signal to follow them, Avhen all the vessels Avere reported to me to be in a sinking state : it then became necessary to annul the signal to the galleys, and order their men to the pumps. I could only look at the enemy's galleys going off in a shattered condition, for there was not a mast in either squadron that could stand to make sail on ; the loAver rigging, being nearly all shot away, hung doAvn as though it had been just placed over the mast heads. The Saratoga had fifty-five round shot in her hull; the Constance one hundred and five.

The British officers taken were captain Pring and six or eight lieutenants. The wounded were paroled and sent by a flag to the Isle-au-Noix. The British large ship proved to be a very fine vessel of her class, having two gun decks in her bow and stern, and mounting, among her guns, twenty eight long twenty-four pounders, a battery which few frigates of the British navy can boast. On the 13th of September, the interment of the American and British officers, who fell in the memo rable battle of the 11th, took place at Plattsburgh, in a manner to do honour to the bravery with which they defended their respective flags.

The privateer schooner Atlas, of nineteen guns, captain David Mo flat, soon after the declaration of war, sailed from Philadelphia.

She continued engaged with both ships till noon, Avhen the smallest one struck her colours. The Atlas then directed the whole of her fire against the large ship ; when the small one, though her colours were down, renewed her fire on she Atlas, which had to recommence firing on her. In a few minutes every man was driven from her decks'; Twenty minutes after twelve, the large ship struck. Possession was immediately taken of both of them. One proved to be the ship Pursuit, captain Chivers, of four hundred and fifty tons, sixteen guns, and thirty-five men. The other was the ship Planter, captain Frith, of Iavo hundred and eighty tons, twelve guns, and fifteen men. The cargoes of both were verv valuable. 21"], [206, "186 NAVAL TEMPLE. The Atlas had two men killed and five wounded, and her rigging and sails much injured. She ar rived safe in port with the Pursuit ; the Planter was recaptured off the capes of Delaware. THE YOUNG EAGLE Of NeAv York, of one gun and forty-two men, engaged the British armed ship Granada, of eleven guns and thirty men, and another armed vessel in company Avith her. After an action of an hour and a half, the Young Eagle succeeded in capturing them both. THE MONTGOMERY, Captain Upton, of Boston, mounting twelve guns, on the 6th of December, 1812, off Surinam, fell in with the British vessel of war Surinam, of twenty guns. They lay board and board for half an hour. Some of the privateer's men lashed the bobstay of the Surinam to the Montgomery's main mast. So spirited was the resistance on both sides, that neither could succeed in boarding. One of the Montgomery's eighteen pounders was repeatedly discharged into the bows of her antagonist betAveen Avind and Avater. As soon as the two vessels parted,"], [207, "187 NAVAL TEMPLE. the Surinam made sail from the Montgomery. Her foremast was shot away, and she was otherwise so much disabled, as to be compelled to put into an outport to refit, without proceeding to the common place of rendezvous at Barbadoes. THE DOLPHIN Of Baltimore, of ten guns and sixty men, in the latter part of the year, engaged two British armed vessels at the same time, the one of sixteen guns and forty men, and the other of ten guns and twenty five men. She captured them both. THE ROLLA Of Baltimore, of nineteen guns, captured seven vessels in one cruise, the guns of which amounted to fifty-eight, and the prisoners to one hundred and fifty. THE HAZARD Of Charleston, of three guns and thirty-eight men, commanded by Placide le Chartier, while at"], [208, "188 NAVAL TEMPLE. anchor off the island of Davie, discovered a man of Avar brig convoying five merchantmen. One of these last, having lost her mizzenmast, could not keep up with the rest of the convoy. As soon as they were out of sight, the Hazard pursued her, to which, after some resistance, she struck. She proved to be the Albion, of London, copper-bottomed, and of three hundred tons burden, navigated by fifteen men, and mounting twelve guns. While the Hazard was lying off Charleston, in a fog, her prize was separated from her, and recaptur ed by a British cutter, the Caledonia, of eight guns and thirty-eight men. Three days after, on the 22d of February, the Hazard discovered her prize in company Avith the above-mentioned British cut ter. The Hazard commenced a pursuit of them both. As soon as the Hazard came within musket shot, she commenced firing at the ship and cutter, which was returned by them Avith spirit, and appa rent determination. At three o'clock, the second lieutenant, carpenter, ana five men of the Hazard, were severely wounded. At five, the cutter hauled off to repair the damages she had sustained. At half past five, the Hazard came close to the cutter, the crew of the former, having determined to lose their lives sooner than give up so valuable a prize. At half past six the British cutter again hauled off, and continued to fire at a distance. Taking advan tage of this, the Hazard bore down on the prize, and after a brisk fire caused her to strike her colours. She was then ordered to lie to."], [209, "189 NAVAL TEMPLE. The British cutter having shot ahead, Le Chartier instantly gave chase, keeping up a brisk fire. He pursued her until eight o'clock. The cutter then ceased firing, and hailed, saying she had struck, and signified the same by hoisting and lowering a lan tern three times. The Hazard having then but twenty-one men, including the captain, on board, it \\vas not thought advisable to take possession of her- She bore down for the prize, of which she took pos session, leaving a prize-master and six men on board of her, so that there only remained fourteen men on board of the Hazard. Both the Hazard and her prize arrived safe at St. Mary's. THE COMET Of Baltimore, captain Boyle, of twelve guns and one hundred and twenty men, being on a cruise, discovered, on the 14th of January, 1813, four sail standing out of Pernambuco. She lay by to give them an opportunity of getting off shore, with a view of then cutting them off. At three p. m. they were upon a wind standing s. e. and about six leagues from land. The Comet bore up, and made sail in chase. At six, one of them was discovered to be a large man of war brig. All hands were immediately called to quarters on board the Comet ; the guns were loaded with round and grape shot ; .and the ship cleared for action. At seven, being"], [210, "190 NAVAL TEMPLE. close to the chase, she hoisted her colours, and came close to the man of war brig, which had hoisted Portuguese colours. The commander hailed, and sent an officer on board the Comet, who informed captain Boyle, that the brig Avas a Portuguese na tional vessel, mounting twenty thirty-two pounders and one hundred and sixty -five men ; that the three others Avere strongly armed English vessels ; and that he must not molest them. Captain Boyle in formed him that he certainly should make use of every exertion to capture them. The Portuguese said he was ordered to protect them, and certainly should. The English vessels were ahead of the Comet. They consisted of a ship of fourteen guns, and two brigs of ten guns each. So that including the Por tuguese vessel, the Comet had a force of fifty-four guns to oppose. Captain Boyle immediately made sail for them ; came up Avith the ship, hailed her, and ordered the captain to have the mainsail back ed. He gave little or no answer. The Comet hav ing shot ahead, captain Boyle informed him, that he should be along in a few minutes, Avhen if he did not obey his orders, he would pour a broadside into the ship. In a few minutes the Comet tacked, the Portuguese sloop of Avar being close after her, and ran along side of the ship, one of the brigs being close to her. The Comet opened a broadside on them both. It was now about half past eight p. m. All the vessels Avere carrying a press of sail. The Comet, from her superior sailing, was frequently"], [211, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 191 obliged to tack. From this she Avould have profited very much, had not the Portuguese sloop of war been so close. The latter noAV opened a heavy fire on the Comet, with round and grape shot, which she returned. The Comet had now the whole force of the four vessels to contend Avith. She, hoAvever, kept as closely as possible to the English vessels. They frequently separated, to give the sloop of war an opportunity of firing into the Comet. The latter as frequently poured whole broadsides into them ; at times also into the sloop of war. About eleven p. m. the ship surrendered \u2014 she was cut to pieces, and rendered unmanageable. Soon after the brig BoAves struck \u2014 she also was much injured. A boat was sent to take possession of her ; as it passed the sloop of war, a broadside was fired by her, which nearly sunk it, and obliged it to return. The Comet then commenced a brisk fire at the sloop of war, which sheered off to some distance. After following her a short distance, she obliged the third English vessel to strike. The latter was very much cut to pieces. The Comet now again proceeded to take possession of the Bowes, when she spoke the ship that had first sur rendered \u2014 her captain being ordered to folloAv, informed captain Boyle that his ship was in a sink ing condition, having many shot holes between wind and water, and every rope on board of her being cut away. At half past one, a. m. the BoAves Avas taken possession of and manned. The sloop of Avar"], [212, "192 NAVAL temple. then fired a broadside into the prize, and passed her. The moon was now down, and it became quite dark and squally. This caused the Comet to separate from the other vessels, excepting the sloop of war, with which broadsides were frequently ex changed. At tAvo, she stood to the south. Captain Boyle now thought it most prudent to take care of one of the prizes until daylight, the other tAATo being out of sight. At daybreak, the sloop of Avar, and the two other prizes, a ship and brig, were discover ed. The Comet immediately hove about, and stood for them. The sloop tacked, and made signals for her convoy to make for the first port. Captain Boyle, knowing the situation of the ship and brig, determined not to take possession of them, but to watch their man\u0153uvres. Great exertions appeared to be made to keep them from sinking. Captain Boyle was afterwards informed that the sloop of war was much injured \u2014 she had five men killed, and a number wounded. The ship's mast scarcely lasted to carry her into Pernambuco. Her cargo was nearly all damaged. It was with diffi culty the brig was kept from sinking before she reached Pernambuco harbour. After capturing the Aberdeen, of eight guns, tAvo vessels of ten guns each, in sight of a sloop of war, and a schooner, captain Boyle returned to the Unit ed States. He passed the blockading squadron in the Chesapeake, and arrived safe at Baltimore."], [213, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 193 THE GENERAL ARMSTRONG, A schooner of eighteen guns, commanded by captain Champlin, was cruising off Surinam, on the 11th March, 1813. At seven a. m. she discovered a sail, which at half past eight, fired three guns, and hoisted English colours. About nine, the Arm strong fired a gun, and hoisted American colours. At half after nine, the British vessel tacked, and stood as near the Armstrong as the wind would per mit, keeping up a brisk fire from her main deck guns. At half past ten, the Armstrong bore down, intending to pour her starboard broadside into her, then wear ship, discharge the larboard broadside, and then board. This was done, except the board ing. The English vessel was noAv discovered to be a frigate, pierced for twenty-four guns. She kept up a constant fire on the Armstrong, which lay for ten minutes like a log. The fore-top-sail and miz zen-gaff halyards of the frigate were shot away. This brought down her colours. The crew of the Armstrong, thinking she had struck, ceased firing. But they were soon again seen flying, and the ac tion was renewed. The frigate lay for a few minutes apparently unmanageable. She soon, however, re covered, and opened a heavy fire from her starUbard broadside and main-top ; apparently with the inten tion of sinking the Armstrong. The latter lay for the space of forty-five minutes Avithin pistol shot of the frigate. Captain Champlin was standing by the 25"], [214, "194 NAVAL TEMPLE. centre gun, in the act of firing his pistol, when he was Avounded by a musket ball from the main top of the frigate. The Armstrong luffed to Avindward, and forereached the frigate. The Armstrong had six men killed, and sixteen Avounded, and was very much injured in her rigging, masts, and hull \u2014 she, however, succeeded in es caping from the frigate. THE YOUNG TEAZER, Captain Dobson, of New York, was chased into Halifax by the Sir John Sherbroke, a vessel of superior force. When within the light house she hoisted English colours over the American, and was chased nearly up to the forts, when the Sir John Sherbroke supposing her to be a prize, hove about, and put to sea. As soon as the latter was out of sight, the Young Teazer hauled down her English colours, and effected her escape. THE DECATUR, Of Charleston, mounting seven guns, with a creAv of one hundred and three men, and commanded by captain Diron, being on a cruise in the month of August, discovered a ship and schooner. She im mediately stood towards them to reconnoitre. At"], [215, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 195 half past tAvelve, the Decatur was abreast of the schooner, which hoisted English colours. At one the Decatur Avore round ; and half an hour after the schooner fired a shot without effect. The cap tain of the Decatur immediately gave orders to pre pare for action. At two o'clock the schooner fired another shot, which passed over the Decatur. At a quarter past two, the latter fired her large gun, and hoisted American colours at the peak : two more discharges were made from the same piece, which were answered by two guns from the British schooner. The two vessels were now Avithin half gun shot distance. Captain Diron, observing that the schooner was preparing to bear away, hauled upon the larboard tack, in order to present the bow of his vessel to his antagonist. Soon afterwards the latter fired her Avhole broadside, which only slightly damaged the Decatur's rigging. This was returned from the eighteen pounder of the Decatur. Her captain, at the same time, ordered every one of the creAv to his post, in order to carry the British vessel by boarding, as soon as the necessary prepa rations for the purpose should be made. It was noAV three quarters of an hour past two, and the vessels Avere within pistol shot of each other. A severe fire of musketry commenced from the Deca tur. The British schooner bore avvay to prevent being boarded ; and fired a broadside into the De catur, which killed tAvo of her men, and injured her rigging and sails. The Decatur closely folloAved her antagonist in her man\u0153uvres, and again endea-"], [216, "196 NAVAL TEMPLE. voured to board, which the schooner once more avoided, and fired another broadside. A third at tempt was made by the captain of the Decatur to board. The jib-boom of the Decatur was run into the mainsail of the schooner, and the latter not being able to disengage herself, dropped along side. Dur ing this man\u0153uvre the fire from the cannon and musketry on both sides Avas extremely severe and destructive. While the two vessels lay in this po sition captain Diron ordered his whole crew, armed with pistols, sabres, &c. to board, which was per formed with the greatest promptness. The resis tance of the English was desperate. Fire arms soon became useless, and the contest was carried on with the cutlass. The captain and principal officers of the British vessel being killed, and her deck covered Avith dead and wounded, her colours were hauled down by the crew of the Decatur, when the two vessels were separated, having their rigging and sails cut to pieces. The English vessel was his Britannick majesty's schooner Dominica, of fifteen guns, with a crew of eighty-eight men. The Decatur had four men killed and sixteen wounded ; the Dominica thirteen killed and forty-seven wounded. Among the killed of the Dominica was her brave commander, who, as long as he lived, refused to surrender his vessel, and declared his determination not to survive her loss. The king's packet Princess Charlotte, remained an inactive spectator of this bloody contest, which lasted an hour. As soon as the vessels were disen-"], [217, "197 NAVAL TEMPLE. gaged, she tacked about and stood to the southward. She had sailed from St. Thomas, under convoy of the Dominica. The Decatur and her prize arrived safe in port. THE SARATOGA, Of four guns and one hundred and sixteen men, belonging to NeAV York, while cruising off Surinam river, in the month of September, discovered the British packet, brig Morgiana, of eighteen guns, with a crew of about fifty men, commanded by James Cunningham. Captain Aderton, the com mander of the Saratoga, immediately gave chase : when within musket shot, the Morgiana hoisted English colours, and the action commenced : part of the time the vessels were Avithin pistol shot : the remainder, they were close along side of each other. After an action of an hour and a quarter the Saratoga succeeded in capturing the British vessel by boarding. The action was extremely severe. Both vessels were almost reduced to wrecks. The Saratoga had almost all her stays, shrouds, &c. cut away. In her mainsail there were upwards of a hundred shot holes. A number of shot also struck her masts, spars, and hull. The crew of the Mor giana fought with desperation. She had two men killed, and eight wounded. The Saratoga had two men killed and five wounded. Both arrived safe in port."], [218, "198 NAVAL TEMPLE. THE GENERAL ARMSTRONG. The following letter from John D. Dabney, Esq. American consul at Fayal, (Portugal,) gives the particulars of a flagrant violation of the neutrality of that port, in an attack upon the privateer General Armstrong, by the enemy. The Armstrong belong ed to NeAv York, and mounted eight long nines and a twenty-four pounder. Fayal, October 5, 1814. Sir, \u2014 I have the honour to state to you that a most outrageous violation of the neutrality of this port, in utter contempt of the laws of civilized na tions, has recently been committed here, by the commanders of his Britannick majesty's ships Plan taganet, Rota and Carnation, against the American private armed brig General Armstrong, Samuel C. Reid, commander ; but I have great satisfaction in being able to add, that this occurrence terminated in one of the most brilliant actions on the part of captain Reid, his brave officers and crew, that can be found on naval record. The American brig came to anchor in this port in the afternoon of the 26th of September, and at sunset of the same day, the above named ships sud denly appeared in these roads ; it being nearly calm in the port, Avas rather doubtful if the privateer could escape if she got under Avay, and relying on the justice and good faith of the British captains, it"], [219, "199 NAVAL TEMPLE. was deemed most prudent to remain at anchor. A little after dusk captain Reid seeing some suspicious movements on the part of the British, began to warp his vessel close under the guns of the castle, and while doing so, he Avas at about eight o'clock, p. M. approached by four boats from the ships filled with armed men. Aster hailing them repeatedly and warning them to keep off, he ordered his men to fire upon them and killed and wounded several men. The boats returned the fire and killed one man and wounded the first lieutenant of the priva teer, and returned to their ships ; and, as it was hoav light moonlight, it Avas plainly perceived from the brig as Avell as from the shore, that a formidable attack was premeditating. Soon after smidnight, twelve or more large boats, crowded with men from the ships, and armed with carronades, swivels and blunderbusses, small arms, &c. attacked the brig ; a severe contest ensued which lasted about forty minutes and ended in the total defeat and partial destruction of the boats, with a most unparalleled carnage on the part of the British. It is estimated by good judges that near four hundred men were in the boats when the attack commenced, and no doubt exists in the minds of the numerous spectators of the scene, that more than one half of them were killed or Avounded ; several boats were destroyed ; two of them remained along side of the brig literally loaded with their own dead. From these tAvo boats only seventeen reached the shore alive ; most of them Avere severely wounded. The whole of the"], [220, "200 NAVAL TEMPLE. following day the British were occupied in bury ing their dead ; among them were two lieutenants and one midshipman of the Rota \u2014 the first lieuten ant of the Plantaganet, it is said, cannot survive his Avounds, and many of the seamen who reached their ships were mortally wounded and have been dying daily. The British, mortified at this signal and un expected defeat, endeavoured to conceal the extent of the loss ; they admit however that they lost in killed and who have died since the engagement, up wards of one hundred and twenty of the flower of their officers and men. The captain of the Rota told me he lost seventy men from his ship. Two days after this affair took place the British sloopa of war Thais and Calypso came into port, when captain Lloyd immediately took them into requisi tion to carry home the wounded officers and sea men. They have sailed for England, one on the 2d and the other on the 4th instant each carried tAventy-five badly Avounded. Those Avho were slightly Avounded, to the number, as I am informed, of about thirty, remained on board of their respec tive ships, and sailed last evening for Jamaica. Strict orders were given that the sloops of Avar should take no letters Avhatever to England, and those orders were rigidly adhered to. In face of the testimony of all Fayal, and a num ber of respectable strangers, who happened to be in this place at the moment, the British commander endeavours to throAv the odium of this transaction on the American captain, Reid, alleging that he sent"], [221, "201 NAVAL TEMPLE. the boats merely to reconnoitre the brig, and with out any hostile intentions ; the pilots of the port did inform them of the privateer the moment they entered the port. To reconnoitre an enemy's ves sel in a friendly port, at night, with four boats, car rying, by the best accounts, one hundred and twenty men, is certainly a strange proceeding ! The fact is, they expected, as the brig was warping in, that the Americans would not be prepared to receive them, and they had hopes of carrying her by a \" coup de main.\" If any thing could add to the baseness of this transaction on the part of the British com mander, it is the want of candour openly and boldly to avoAv the facts. In vain can he expect by such subterfuge to shield himself from the indignation of the world, and the merited resentment of his own government and nation for thus trampling on the sovereignty of their most ancient and faithful ally, and for the Avanton sacrifice of British lives. On the part of the Americans the loss was com paratively nothing ; two killed and seven wounded : of the slain \\ve have to lament the loss of the second lieutenant, Mr. Alexander O. Williams, of New York, a brave and meritorious officer. Among the wounded are Messrs. Worth and Johnson, first and third lieutenants ; captain Reid was thus deprived, early in the action, of the services of all his lieutenants; but his cool and intrepid conduct secured him the victory. On the morning of the 27th ult. one of the Brit ish ships placed herself near the shore and com- 26"], [222, "202 \\AVAL TEMPLE. menced a heavy cannonade on the privateer. Finding further resistance unavailing, captain Reid ordered her to be abandoned after being partially destroyed, to prevent her falling into the hands of the enemy, who soon after sent their boats and set her on fire. At nine o'clock in the evening (soon after the first attack) I applied to the governour, requesting his excellency to protect the privateer, either by force or by such remonstrance to the commander of the squadron as Avould cause him to desist from any further attempt. The governour indignant at what had passed, but feeling himself totally unable with the slender means he possessed, to resist such a force, took the part of remonstrating, which he did in forcible but respectful terms. His letter to captain Lloyd had no other effect than to produce a menacing reply insulting in the highest degree. Nothing can exceed the indignation of the publick authorities, as Avell as of all ranks and descriptions of persons here, at this unprovoked enormity. Such was the rage of the British to destroy this vessel, that no regard was paid to the safety of the town ; some of the inhabitants were wounded, and a num ber of houses Avere much damaged. The strongest representations on this subject are prepared by the governour for his court. Since this affair the commander, captain Lloyd, threatened to send on shore an armed force, and arrest the privateer's crew ; saying, there were many Englishmen among them; and our poor fellows,"], [223, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 203 afraid of his vengeance, have fled to the mountains several times, and have been harassed extremely. At length, captain Lloyd, fearful of losing more men if he put his threats in execution, adopted this stratagem : he addressed an official letter to the governour, stating that in the American crew Avere two men who deserted from his squadron in Ameri ca, and as they were guilty of high treason, he re quired them to be found and given up. Accord ingly a force was sent into the country, and the American seamen Avere arrested and brought to town, and as they could not designate the said pre tended deserters, all the seamen here passed an examination of the British officers, but no such per sons were to be found among them. I was request ed by the governour and British consul to attend this humiliating examination, as was also captain Reid ; but Ave declined to sanction by our presence any such proceedings. Captain Reid has protested against the British commanders of the squadron for the unwarrantable destruction of his vessel in a neutral and friendly port, as also against the government of Portugal for their inability to protect him.

PORTER'S SETTLEMENT AT NOOAHEEVAH Letter from captain John M. Gamble of the marines, detailing the occurrences which took place at Nooaheevah after the departure of captain Porter, and his subsequent capture by the Cherub. New York, August, 1815. Sir, \u2014 I have the honour to inform you, that on the 12th of December, 1813, the day on which the Essex frigate, and Essex junior, took their depar ture from Nooaheevah, I Avas left in port Anna Maria bay, with eighteen men under my command, and six prisoners of war, in charge of the establish ment on shore, together with the prize ships Green- Avich, Seringapatam, and Sir Andrew Hammond, with orders from captain Porter to remain five and a half calendar months at that place \u2014 at the expiration of Avhich time, should he not return, or send me further instructions how to act, I was, if possible, to man two of the ships, and after taking every article of value out of the other, and burning that ship, to repair to the port of Valparaiso \u2014 where, in the event of my not finding the frigate or additional orders, I was authorized to dispose of one of the ships to the best advantage, taking on board the other all the men under my charge, as well as the prize-crews of the different ships then in that port, and proceed to the United States."], [225, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 205 After receiving those instructions, my first object was, agreeably to the wish of captain Porter, to fill the ship New Zealander with oil from the other ships ; and on the 28th of the same month she took her departure for the United States, with a cargo of nineteen hundred and fifty barrels, and well found in every respect for so long a voyage. With regret, sir, I have to inform you, the fri gate had not got clear of the Marquesas, before we discovered in the natives a hostile disposition to wards us, and in a few days they became so insolent, that I found it absolutely necessary, not only for the security of the ships and property on shore, but for our personal safety, to land my men and regain by force of arms the many articles they had in the most daring manner stolen from the encampment ; and what was of still greater importance, to prevent, if possible, their putting threats into execution, which might have been attended with the most serious consequences on our part, from duty re quiring my men to be so much separated. I, however, had the satisfaction to accomplish my wish without firing a musket, and from that time lived in perfect amity with them, until the 7th May following, Avhen my distressed situation placed me in their power. Before mentioning the lamentable events of that day, and the two succeeding ones, I shall give you a brief account of a few preceding occurrences which were sources of great uneasiness to me. The first was the death of John Witter (a faithful"], [226, "206 NAVAL TEMPLE. old marine) who was unfortunately drowned in the surf on the afternoon of the 28th of February, and the desertion of four of my men ; the one Isaac Coffin (black man) had deserted from the Essex the day before she sailed out of the bay, and was then a prisoner for attempting the second time to make his escape from the ships. They took the advantage of a dark night, and left the bay in a Avhale-boat, unobserved by any person, all, except ing the prisoner, having the watch on deck. They took with them several muskets, a supply of ammu nition, and many things of but little value. My at tempt to pursue them was prevented, by their destroying, in a great measure, the only remaining boat at that time seaAVorthy. On the 12th April began to rig the ships Seringa patam,and Sir Andrew Hammond, which, as I calcu lated, employed the men until the 1st of May. All hands were then engaged in getting the remainder of the property from the Greenwich to the Seringa patam, as I began to despair of the frigate rejoining me at that place. The Avork went on well, and the men were obe dient to my orders, though I discovered an evident change in their countenances, which led me to sup pose there Avas something wrong in agitation, and under that impression had all the muskets, ammuni tion, and small arms of every description taken to the Greemvich (the ship 1 lived on board of) from the other ships, as a necessary precaution against a surprise from my oavii men."], [227, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 207 On the 7th of May, while on board the Seringa patam on duty which required my being present, I was suddenly and violently attacked by the men employed in that ship. After struggling a short time, and receiving many bruises, I was thrown down on the deck, and my hands and legs im mediately tied. They then threw me on the second deck, thence dragged me into the cabin, and confined me to the run, where in a few mi nutes midshipman Feltus, and acting midshipman Clapp Avere thrown in, tied in the same manner as myself : the scuttle was then nailed down and a sentinel placed over it. After spiking all the guns of the Greenwich, and of the fort, and those of the Sir Andrew Hammond that were loaded, plundering the ships of every thing valuable, \u2014 committing many wanton depreda tions on shore, taking all the arms and ammunition from the Greenwich ; sending for Robert White, the man who was sent out of the Essex for mutinous conduct, and bending the necessary sails, they stood out of the bay, Avith a light wind off the land. My fellow prisoners, and shortly after myself, Avere then taken out of the run, and placed in the cabin, under the immediate charge of several sentinels. Shortly aster getting clear of the bay, one of the sentinels, though he had been repeatedly cautioned against putting his finger on the trigger, fired a pis tol, the contents of which passed through my heel a little below the ankle bone."], [228, "208 NAVAL TEMPLE. I had not received the wound a moment before the men on deck pointed their muskets down the sky-light, and were in the act of firing, when the sentinel prevented them by saying the pistol was accidentally discharged. At nine o'clock, the night dark, and the wind blowing fresh, after receiving by request from the mutineers a barrel of powder, and three old mus kets, I Avas put in a leaky boat, where I found my unfortunate companions. In that situation, after rowing at least six miles, and every person exhausted from the great exer tion made to prevent the boat from sinking, we reached Greenwich, where I found my few remain ing men anxiously looking out for me, and seriously alarmed at the conduct of the savages. They had already begun to plunder the encampment, and Avere informed by Wilson (a man who had lived among them for several years, and who, as I after wards learnt, Avas not only instrumental to the mutiny, but had in my absence plundered the Sir Andrew Hammond) of our defenceless situation. Finding it impossible to comply Avith that part of my instructions directing me to remain in the bay until the 27th May \u2014 I thought it most advisable to repair to the port of Valparaiso; and with that view every soul, assisted by George Ross, and Wil liam Brudewell, (traders living on the island for the purpose of collecting sandal Avood,) exerted them selves in making the necessary preparations to depart."], [229, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 209 My first object was to put the Sir AndreAv Ham mond in a situation that Ave might get under way at any moment. That done, all hands were engaged in getting the feAv articles of value from shore, and endeavouring to recover the stolen property from the Sir AndreAv Hammond, when the savages made an unprovoked and wanton attack upon us, in which I have, Avith the deepest regret, to inform you, mid shipman William Feltus, John Thomas, Thomas Gibbs, and William BrudeAvell were massacred, and Peter Caddington (marine) dangerously wounded ; but he made his escape together Avith William Worth, by swimming some distance, when they were taken out of the Avater by midshipman Clapp and the only three men left. Our situation at that moment was most desperate \u2014 the savages put off in every direction with a vieAV to intercept the boat, and board the ship, but were driven back by my firing the feAv guns we had just before loaded with grape and cannister shot. Before the boat return ed, and the guns were reloaded, they made the second attempt, and aftenvards repeated attempts, first to board the Sir Andrew7 Hammond, and then the Greenwich \u2014 but were repulsed by our keeping up a constant firing. During this time several hun dred Avere employed in pulling down the houses, and plundering the encampment, Avhile others wrere in the fort, endeavouring (assisted by Wilson who had received several casks of poAvder from the mutineers) to get the spikes out of the guns. 27"], [230, "210 NATAL TEMPLE. As soon as William Worth had recovered a little strength after being so long in the water, I sent the boat to the Greenwich, for John Pitlenger (a sick man) and some things that were indispensably ne cessary, and with orders to burn that ship, and return Avith all possible despatch, as our ammunition was nearly all expended, and we had no other means of keeping the savages one moment out of the ship. We then bent the jib and spanker, cut the moor ings, and luckily had a light breeze that carried us clear of the bay, with six cartridges only remain ing. It Avas then Ave found our situation most dis tressing. In attempting to run the boat up, it broke in Iavo parts, and we Avere compelled to cut away from the bows our only anchor, not being able to cat it. We mustered altogether eight souls \u2014 out of Avhich there was one cripple confined to his bed, one man dangerously Avounded, one sick, one con valescent, a feeble old man just recovering from the scurvy, and myself unable to lend any further as sistance, the exertions of the day having so greatly inflamed my wound as to produce a violent fever, \u2014 leaving midshipman Clapp, and two men only capa ble of doing duty. In that state, destitute of charts and of every means of getting to Avindward, I saw but one alternative, to run the trade winds doAvn, and if possible make the Sandwich islands, in hopes of either falling in Avith some of the Canton ships, sthat being their principal place of rendezvous) or"], [231, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 211 of obtaining some assistance from Tamaahmaah, the king of the Windward Islands. No time Avas lost in bending the topsails, and on the 10th of May we took our departure from Ro berts island. On the 25th of the same month made Owhyhee, and on the 30th after suffering much, came to an anchor in Whytetee bay, at the island of Whoohoo, where I found captain Winship, several officers of ships, and a number of men, from Avhom (particularly captain Winship) I received every assistance their situation could afford me. The natives, though at first surprised at our de plorable condition, and inquisitive to know the cause of it, Avhich I did not think prudent to inform them, supplied the ship with fresh meat, fruits and vegetables, partly on condition that I would take the chief men of the island, and some others with their property up to the Windward Islands, (Avhere I found it necessary to go,) after shipping some men, in order to procure a supply of salt provisions from the king. From thence it was my intention to have proceeded to Valparaiso in compliance with my instructions from captain Porter, \u2014 but I Avas unfor tunately captured on the passage by the English ship Cherub of twenty guns. I was somewhat suprised to hear captain Tucker say (Avhen I pointed out a valuable canoe, and many other articles which I as sured him was the property of the natives, and that I was merely conveying them, and it, from the one island to the other, the weather being too boisterous at that time for them to make the passage in their"], [232, "212 NAVAL TEMPLE. canoes,) that every thing found in a prize-ship be longed to the captors. So that I had the mortification to see the people from whom I had received so much kindness, sent on shore, deprived of all they had been collecting for twelve months past, and Avere about to present to their king as a tribute imposed upon them. The Cherub then proceeded to Atooi, where after capturing the ship Charon, and making many fruitless attempts to get the cargo of that ship, and of several others that had been deposited on the island, under the immediate protection of the king of the Leeward Islands, she took her departure on the 15th of July from that place, and on the 28th November folloAving, arrived at Rio de Janeiro with her prizes, touching on her passage for refresh ments at Otaheite and at Valparaiso. During her stay at the latter place, the frigates Briton and Tagus arrived from the Marquesas, where they had been in search of the ships left under my charge. On the 1 5th of December the prisoners were sent on shore, having received the most rigorous treat ment from captain Tucker, during their long con finement in his ship, and the greater part of them, like the natives, lest destitute of every thing, save tire clothes on their backs. The men belonging to the Essex had but little to lose, but those I shipped at Waahoo had received in part, money and goods for one, two, and some of them three years services in the Canton ships."], [233, "213 NAVAL TEMPLE. On the 1 5th of May, by the advice of a physician Avho attended me, I took my departure from Rio de Janeiro, in a Swedish ship bound to Havre de Grace, leaving behind acting midshipman Benjamin Clapp, and five men, having lost one soon after my arrival at that place with the small pox.

To the honourable the Secretary of the Navy, Washington."], [234, "ALGER1NE WAR. Immediately after the ratification of peace with Great Britain, in February 1815, Congress, in con sequence of the hostile conduct of the regency of Algiers, declared war against that power. A squad ron was immediately fitted out, under the command of commodore Decatur, consisting of the Guerriere, Constellation, and Macedonian frigates, the Ontario and Epervier sloops of war, and the schooners Spark, Spitfire, Torch, and Flambeau. Another squadron, under commodore Bainbridge, was to follow this armament, on the arrival of w-hich, it was understood, commodore Decatur would return to the United States in a single vessel, leaving the command of the whole combined force to commo dore Bainbridge. The force under commodore Decatur rendez voused at New York, from which port they sailed the 20th day of May, 1815, and arrived in the bay of Gibraltar in twenty-five days, after having previous ly communicated with Cadiz and Tangier. In the passage, the Spitfire, Torch, Firefly, and Ontario, separated at different times from the squadron in gales, but all joined again at Gibraltar, with the"], [235, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 215 exception of the Firefly, which sprung her masts, and put back to New York to refit. Having learn ed at Gibraltar that the Algerine squadron, which had been out into the Atlantick, had undoubtedly passed up the straits, and that information of the arrival of the American force had been sent to Al giers by persons in Gibraltar, commodore Decatur determined to proceed without delay, up the Medi terranean, in the hope of intercepting the enemy before he could return to Algiers, or gain a neutral port. The 17th of June, off Cape de Gatt, he fell in with and captured the Algerine frigate Mazouda, in a running fight of twenty-five minutes. After two broadsides the Algerines ran below. The Guerriere had four men wounded by musketry \u2014 the Algerines about thirty killed, according to the statement of the prisoners, who amounted to four hundred and six. In this affair the famous Algerine admiral, or Rais, Hammida, who had long been the terror of this sea, was cut in two by a cannon shot. On the 19th of June, off cape Palos, the squadron fell in with and captured an Algerine brig of tAven ty-two guns. The brig was chased close to the shore, where she was followed by the Epervier, Spark, Torch, and Spitfire, to whom she surrender ed, after losing twenty-three men. No Americans were either killed or wounded. The captured brig, with most of the prisoners on board, was sent into Carthagena, where she has since been claimed by the Spanish government under the plea of a"], [236, "216 NAVAL TEMPLE.- breach of neutrality. As this affair will probably become a subject of negotiation between the Unit ed States and Spain, Ave decline entering into fur ther particulars. From cape Palos, the American squadron pro ceeded to Algiers, where it arrived the 28th of June. AAvare that a despatch-boat had been sent from Gibraltar, to inform the regency of his arrival, and having also learned that several Tartans had gone in search of the Algerines, to communicate the neAvs, commodore Decatur concluded that their fleet Avas by this time safe in some neutral port. He therefore thought it a favourable time to take advantage of the terror Avhich his sudden and unwelcome arrival had excited, to despatch a letter from the President of the United States to the dey, in order to afford him a fair opportunity to open a negotiation. The captain of the port Avas immedi ately despatched to the Guerriere, on the receipt of this letter, accompanied by Mr. Norderling the SAvedish consul; and commodore Decatur, who, wdth Mr. Shaler, had been empowered to negotiate a treaty, proposed the basis, on Avhich alone he could consent to enter on the affair of an adjust ment. This Avas the absolute and unqualified relin quishment of any demand of tribute on the part of the regency, on any pretence Avhatever. To this he demurred. He was then asked if he knew what had become of the Algerine squadron, and replied \u2014 \" By this time it is safe in some neutral port.\" \" Not the Avhole of it,\" Avas the reply. He was then told"], [237, "JiT.J&eaitM \u00a3\u00a3.-&. JBayfn- Perm. . \u2022"], [238, ""], [239, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 217 of the capture of the frigate, of the brig, and of the death of Hamraida. He shook his head, and smiled with a look of incredulity, supposing it a mere at tempt to operate on his fears, and thus induce an acceptance of the proposed basis. But when the lieutenant of Hammida was called in, and the minis ter learned the truth of these particulars, he became completely unnerved, and agreed to negotiate on the proposed basis. He premised, hoAvever, that he was not authorized to conclude a treaty, but re quested the American commissioners to state the conditions they had to propose. This was done, and the captain of the port then requested a cessa tion of hostilities, and that the negotiation should be conducted on shore, the minister of marine having pledged himself for their security while there, and their safe return to the ships Avhenever they pleased. Neither of these propositions were ac cepted, and the captain wras expressly given to un derstand, that not only must the negotiation be carried on in the Guerriere, but that hostilities would still be prosecuted against all vessels belong ing to Algiers, until the treaty was signed by the dey. The captain of the port and Mr. Norderling then Avent on shore, but the next day again came on board, with the information that they were commis sioned by the dey to treat on the basis for which the commissioners of the United States had stipu lated. A treaty was then produced, Avhich the commissioners declared could not be varied in any 28"], [240, "218 NAVAL TEMPLE. material article, and that consequently, discussion Avas not only useless, but dangerous on their part ; for if in the interim the Algerine squadron were to appear, it Avould most assuredly be attacked. On examining the treaty proposed, the captain of the port Avas extremely anxious to get the article stipu lating for the restoration of the property taken by the Algerines during the war dispensed with, ear nestly representing that it had been distributed into many hands, and that as it was not the present dey who declared war, it was unjust that he should an swer for all its consequences. The article was, however, adhered to by the American commission ers, and after various attempts to gain a truce, as well as to gain time, it Avas at length settled that all hostilities should instantly cease, when a boat was seen coming off with a Avhite flag, the Swedish con sul pledging at the same time his honour, that it should not be hoisted until the dey had signed the treaty, and the prisoners were safe in the boat. The captain and Mar. Norderling then went on shore, and returned within three hours ; with the treaty signed, together with all the prisoners, al though the distance Avas more than five miles. The principal articles in this treaty Avere, that no tribute under any pretext or in any form Avhatever, should ever be required by Algiers from the United States of America \u2014 that all Americans in slavery should be given up without ransom \u2014 that compensation should be made for American vessels captured, or property seized or detained at Algiers \u2014 that the"], [241, "219 NAVAL TEMPLE. persons and property of American citizens found on board an enemy's vessel should be sacred \u2014 that vessels of either party putting into port should be supplied Avith provisions at market price, and, if ne cessary to be repaired, should land their cargoes without paying duty \u2014 that if a vessel belonging to either party should be cast on shore, she should not be given up to plunder \u2014 or if attacked by an enemy within cannon shot of a fort, should be protected, and no enemy be permitted to follow her Avhen she went to sea within twenty-four hours. In general, the rights of Americans on the ocean and the land, were fully provided for in every instance, and it was particularly stipulated that all citizens of the United States taken in war, should be treated as prisoners of war are treated by other nations, and not as slaves, but held subject to an exchange Avith out ransom. After concluding this treaty, so highly honourable and advantageous to this country, the commissioners gave up the captured frigate and brig, to their former owners. To this they were influ enced by a consideration of the great expense it Avould require to put them in a condition to be sent to the United States \u2014 the impossibility of dis posing of them in the Mediterranean, and by the pressing instances of the dey himself, Avho earnestly represented that this Avould be the best method of satisfying his people with the treaty just concluded, and consequently the surest guarantee for its ob servance on his part. The policy of the measure we think sufficiently obvious, when it is considered"], [242, "220 NAVAL TEMPLE. that the dey would most likely, in case of their re fusal, have fallen a victim to the indignation of the people, and that, in all probability, his successor would have found his safety only in disowning the peace Avhich had been made by his predecessor. There being, as we before stated, some dispute with the Spanish authorities Avith regard to the legality of the capture of the Algerine brig, it Avas stipulated on the part of the American commissioners, in order to induce the Spaniards to give her up, that the Spa nish consul and a Spanish merchant, then prisoners in Algiers, should be released, and permitted to re turn to Spain if they pleased. According to the last advices the brig Avas still detained by the Spa nish government, and the ultimate disposal of this vessel will probably be settled by an amicable ne gotiation. Commodore Decatur despatched captain LeAvis in the Epervier, bearing the treaty to the United States, and leaving Mr. Shaler at Algiers, as consul general to the Barbary states, proceeded with the rest of the squadron to Tunis, Avith the exception of two schooners under captain Gamble, sent to convoy the Algerine vessels home from Carthagena. He was prompted to this visit, by having been in formed that a misunderstanding existed between our consul and the bashaw of Tunis, into the nature of which he considered himself bound in duty to inquire. Here he Avas officially informed by the consul of a violation of the treaty subsisting betAveen the United States and the bashaw, first, in permit-"], [243, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 221 ting two prizes of an American privateer to be takeir out of the harbour by a British cruiser, and second ly, in permitting a company of merchants, subjects of Tunis, tortake the property of an American citi zen at their own price, and much below its real value. The truth of these allegations being thus officially verified, commodore Decatur addressed a letter to the prime minister of Tunis, demanding satisfaction for these outrages exercised or permitted by the bashaw, and a full restoration of the property thus given up or sacrificed. The bashaAA', through the medium of his prime minister, acknowledged the truth of the facts, as well as the justice of the de mands ; but begged twelve months to pay the money. This was refused ; and on receiving as surances that it would be paid forthwith, the com modore Avent on shore, where he received the visits of the different consuls. The brother of the prime minister of Tunis chanced to arrive with the money at this time, and seeing the British consul in conver sation with commodore Decatur, threw down the bags which contained it with great indignation, at the same time addressing the consul in English, which he spoke fluently, \" You see, sir, what Tunis is obliged to pay for your insolence. You must feel ashamed of the disgrace you have brought upon us. You are very good friends now, but I ask you whether you think it just first to violate our neutrality, and then to leave us to be destroyed, or pay for your aggressions.\" As soon as the"], [244, "222 NAVAL TEMPLE. money was paid, the bashaw prepared to despatch a minister to England, to demand the amount which he had been obliged to pay in consequence of this requisition of the American commodore. After adjusting these differences, the squadron proceeded to Tripoli, where commodore Decatur made a similar demand for a similar violation of the treaty subsisting between the United States and the bashaAV, who had permitted two American ves sels to be taken from under the guns of his castle by a British sloop of Avar, and refused protection to an American cruiser lying within his jurisdiction. Restitution of the full value of these vessels was de manded, and the money, amounting to tAventy-five thousand dollars, paid by the bashaw into the hands of the American consul. After the conclusion of this affair, the American consular flag, which Mr. Jones, the consul, had struck, in consequence of the violation of neutrality above mentioned, was hoisted in the presence of the foreign agents, and saluted from the castle Avith thirty-one guns. In addition to the satisfaction thus obtained for unprovoked aggressions, the commodore had the pleasure of ob taining the release of ten captives, two Danes, and eight Neapolitans, the latter of Avhom he landed at Messina. After touching at Messina and Naples, the squad ron sailed for Carthagena on the 31st of August, where commodore Decatur Avas in expectation of meeting the relief squadron, under commodore Bainbridge. On joining that officer at Gibraltar.."], [245, "NAVAL TEMPLE. 223 he relinquished his command, and sailed in the Guerriere for the United States, where he arrived on the 12th of November, 1815. Every thing being done previous to the arrival of the second division of the squadron, under commodore Bainbridge, that gallant officer had no opportunity of distin guishing himself, as we are satisfied he ahvays will where occasion occurs. Pursuant to his instruc tions he exhibited this additional force before Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, where they were some what surprised at the appearance of the Indepen dence seventy-four, having always been persuaded that the United States were restricted by their treaties with England from building ships of that class. When colonel Lear was consul at Algiers he endeavoured to convince the ministers of the dey that such was not the case ; but they always replied, \" If you are permitted to build seventy fours, let us see one of them and we shall be satis fied.\" Commodore Bainbridge sailed from Gibral tar thirty-six hours before the Guerriere, and ar rived at Boston the 1 5th of November. Thus was concluded an expedition in which, though few, perhaps no opportunities occurred for a display of the hardy prowess of our sailors, the nation acquired singular honour, in humbling and chastising a race of lawless pirates, who have long been the inveterate scourges of the christian world. Independently of the glory thus accruing to the re publican name, the probable advantages arising from this sudden and unlooked-for appearance of an Ame-"], [246, "224 NAVAL TEMPLE. rican squadron immediately after a war with Great Britain,Ave think will be manifold. This circumstance will give them an idea of the power and resources of the United States altogether different from that which they before entertained ; and serve to con- vince them of the danger of provoking their resent- ment under any expectation of the destruction of their navy by any poAver whatever. That the as- surance of an immediate war with England was Avhat principally encouraged the dey of Algiers to commence hostilities against the United States, under a conviction that our little navy would speedily be annihilated, is evident from the follow- ing fact. One of the dey's officers one morning insinuated, whether true or false we cannot say, to the British consul at Algiers, that it was bis fault that they declared war. \" You told us,\" said he, \" that the American navy would be destroyed in six months by you, and now they make war upon us with two of your own vessels they have taken from you /\""], [247, "225 NAVAL TEMPLE. HORNET AND PENGUIN. On the 23d of March, 1815, as the Hornet, commanded by captain Biddle, was about to an chor off the north end of the island of Tristan d'Acuna, a sail was seen to the southAvard ; which, at forty minutes past one, hoisted English colours, and fired a gun. The Hornet immediately luffed to, hoisted an ensign, and gave the enemy a broadside. A quick and well directed fire was kept up from the Hornet, the enemy gradually drifting nearer, with an intention, as captain Biddle supposed, to board. The enemy's boAvsprit came in between the main and mizzen rigging on the starboard side of the Hornet, giving him an oppor tunity to board, if he had wished, but no attempt was made. There was a considerable swell, and as the sea lifted the Hornet ahead, the enemy's bow sprit carried away her mizzen shrouds, stern davits, and spanker booms, and hung upon her larboard quarter. At this moment an officer called out that they had surrendered. Captain Biddle directed the marines to stop firing, and, while asking if they had surrendered, received a Avound in the neck. The enemy just then got clear of the Hornet ; and his foremast and bowsprit being both gone, and per ceiving preparations to give him another broadside, he again called out that he had surrendered. It Avas with great difficulty that captain Biddle could 29"], [248, "226 NAVAL TEMPLE. restrain his crew from firing into him again, as it was certain he had fired into the Hornet after hav ing surrendered. From the firing of the first gun to the last time the enemy cried out that he had surrendered, Avas exactly twenty-tAvo minutes. The vessel proved to be the British brig Penguin, of twenty guns, a remarkably fine vessel of her class, and one hundred and thirty-two men; twelve of them supernumeraries from the Medway, seventy four, received on board in consequence of their being ordered to cruise for the privateer Young Wasp. The Penguin had fourteen killed and twenty eight Avounded. Among the killed was captain Dickenson, who fell at the close of the action. As she Avas completely riddled, and so crippled as to be incapable of being secured, and being at a great dis tance from the United States, captain Biddle order ed her to be scuttled and sunk. The Hornet did not receive a single round shot in her hull ; and though much cut in her sails and rigging, Avas soon made ready for further service. Her loss was one killed and eleven Avounded. ESCAPE OF THE HORNET. On the 28th April, 1815, the Hornet Avas chased by a British seventy-four, and was compelled to throw over her guns, shot, spars, &c. She escaped,"], [249, "227 NAVAL TEMPLE. and put into St. Salvador. On his arrival at that port, captain Biddle received information of the peace between the United States and Great Britain. On the return of captain Biddle to the United States a naval court of inquiry was held by order of the secretary of the navy, on board the Hornet, in the harbour of NeAv York, on the 23d of August, 1815, to investigate the causes of the return of that ship into port, and to inquire into the circumstances attending the loss of armament, stores, &c, during her cruise ; and the following opinion has been pro nounced by the court : The court, after mature deliberation on the testi mony adduced, are of opinion, that no blame is imputable to captain Biddle, on account of the return of the Hornet into port, with the loss of her armament, stores, &c, and that the greatest applause is due to him for his persevering gallantry and nau tical skill, evinced in escaping, under the most dis advantageous circumstances, after a long and ardu ous chase by a British line-of-battle ship.

While Europe displaying her fame claiming page, And vaunting the proofs of her high elevation, Exultingly shows us, just once in an age, Some patriot soul'd chieftain the prop of his nation ; Columbia can boast, of her heroes a host, The foremost at Duty's and Danger's proud post, Who full often have won upon ocean's rough wave, The brightest leav'd laurel that e'er deck'd the brave.

On the 31st of August 1814, the advance of the British army under general Brisbane, entered Champlain, and encamped on the north \u2022side of the Great Chazy river, and on the same day major general Mooers ordered out the militia of the counties of Clinton and Es sex. The regiment from Clinton county, under lieutenant-colonel Miller, immediately assembled, and on the 2d September took a position on the west road near the village of Chazy ; and on the 3d general Wright with such of his brigade as had arrived, occupied a position on the same road about eight miles in advance of Pitts burgh. On the 4th the enemy having brought up his main body to Champlain, took up his line of march for that place. The rifle corps under lieutenant-colonel Appling, on the lake road, fell back as far as Dead Creek, blocking up the road in such manner as to impede the advance of the enemy as much as possible. The enemy advanced on the 5th within a few miles of lieutenant-colonel Ap pling's position, and finding it too strong to attack, halted and caused a road to be made west into the Beekmantown road, in which the light brigade under general Powers advanced, and on the morning of the 6th, about seven o'clock, attacked the militia, which had at this time increased to nearly seven hundred, under general Mooers, and a small detachment of regulars under major Wool, about seven miles from Plattsburgh. After the first fire, a considerable part of the militia broke and fled in every direction. Many, however, manfully stood their ground, and, with the small corps of major Wool, bravely contested the ground, against five times their number, falling back gradually and occupying the fences on each side the road, till they arrived within a mile of the town, when they were reinforced by two pieces of artillery, under cap tain Leonard, and our troops occupying a strong position behind a stone wall, for some time stopped the progress of the enemy : being at length compelled to retire, they contested every inch of ground until they reached the south bank of the Saranac, where the enemy"], [270, "246 APPENDIX. attempted te pursue them but was repulsed with loss. The loss of the British in this skirmish was colonel Wellington and a lieutenant of the third Buffs, and two lieutenants of the fifty -eighth killed, and one captain and one lieutenant of the fifty-eighth light company wounded, together with about one hundred privates killed and wcunded ; while that on Our part did- not exceed twenty-five. The corps of riflemen under colonel Appling, and detachment under captain Sproul, fell back from their position at Dead Creek in time to join the militia, oic. just before they entered the village, and sought with their accustomed bravery. The British got possession of that part of the village north of the Saranac about eleven o'clock, but the incessant and well directed fire of our artillery and mus- ketry from the forts and opposite bank compelled them to retire before night beyond the reach of our guns. The enemy arrived towards night with his heavy artillery and baggage on the lake road and crossed the beach, where he met with a warm reception from our row-galleys, and it is believed suffered a heavy loss in killed and Avounded. On our side, lieutenant Duncan, of the navy, lost an arm by a rocket and three or four men were killed by the enemy's artillery. The enemy encamped on the ridge west of the town, his right near the river, and occupying an extent of nearly three miles, his left resting on the lake about a mile north of the village. From the 6th, until the morning of the 11th, an al- most continual skirmishing was kept up between the enemy's pick- ets and our militia stationed on the river ; and in the mean time both armies were busily engaged \u2014 ours in strengthening the works of the forts, and that of the enemy in erecting batteries, collecting ladders, bringing up his heavy ordnance, and making other prepa rations for attacking the fort. On the morning of the 7th, a body of the enemy under captain Noadie, attempted to cross at the upper bridge, about seven miles west of Plattsburgh, but were met by captain Vaughan's company of about twenty-five men, and compelled to retire with the loss of two killed find several wounded. On the morning of the 11th, the enemy's fleet came round the head with a light breeze from the north, and attacked ours, winch lay at anchor in Cumberland bay, two miles from the shore, east of the fort. The action was long and bloody, but decisive ; and the event such as we believe it will always be (except by accident) when our navy contends with any thing like an equal force. The enemy commenced a simultaneous bombardment of our works from seven batteries, from which several hundred shells and rockets were dis charged, which did us very little injury, and our artillery had nearly succeeded in silencing all before the contest on the lake was decided. The enemy attempted at the same time to throw his main body in rear of the fort, by crossing the river three miles west of the town, near the scite of Pike's cantonment. He site-"], [271, "APPENDIX. 247 ceeded in crossing, alter a brave resistance by the Essex militia and a few of the Vermont volunteers, in all about three hundred and fifty, stationed at that place, who retired back a mile and a half from the river, continually pouring in upon them an incessant fire from behind every tree, until lieutenant Sumpter brought up a piece of artillery to their support, when the enemy commenced a precipitate retreat. The Vermont volunteers, who had hastened to the scene of action on the first alarm, fell upon the enemy's left flank and succeeded in making many prisoners, including three officers. Had the British remained on the south side of the river thirty minutes longer, they must have lost nearly the whole detach ment that crossed. Our loss in this affair was five killed and eight or ten wounded, some mortally. Immediately on ascertaining the loss of the fleet, Sir George Prevost ordered preparations to be made for the retreat of the army, and set off himself with a small escort, for Canada, a little after noon. The main body of the enemy, with the artillery and baggage, were taken off in the afternoon and night, and the rear guard, consisting of the light brigade, started at daybreak, and made a precipitate retreat, leaving their wounded and a large quantity of provision, fixed ammunition, shot, shells and other publick stores in the different places of deposit about their camp. They were pursued some distance by our troops, and many prisoners taken ; but owing to the very heavy and incessant rain, we were compelled to return. The enemy lost, upon land, more than two thousand men in killed, wounded, prison ers and deserters; while our aggregate loss did not exceed one hundred and fifty.* ATTACK ON BALTIMORE. On Saturday the 10th of September, information was received that the enemy was ascending the Chesapeake, and on Sunday morning his ships were seen at the mouth of the Patapsco river, (which communicates with the basin on which Baltimore stands) in number from forty lo fifty. Some of his vessels entered the river, while others proceeded to North Point, (at the mouth of the Pa tapsco,) fourteen miles from Baltimore, and commenced the de barkation of their troops in the night, which was finished early next morning. The following extracts of a letter from general Smith to the secretary of war, give an account of the events which followed : ; Sketches of the AVar, p. 405 \u2014 407."], [272, "248 APPENDIX. \"Baltimore, September 19, 1814. \" I have the honour of stating, that the enemy landed between seven and eight thousand men on Monday the 10th instant, at North Point, fourteen miles distant from this town. Anticipating this debarkation, general Strieker had been detached on Sunday evening with a portion of his brigade on the North Point road. Major Randal, of the Baltimore county militia, having under his command a light corps of riflemen and musketry taken from general Stanbury's brigade and Pennsylvania volunteers, was detached to the mouth of Bear Creek, with orders to co-operate with general Strieker, and to check any landing which the enemy might attempt in that quarter. On Monday, brigadier general Strieker took a good posi- tion at the junction of the two roads leading from this place to North Point, having his right flanked by Bear Creek, and his left by a marsh. He here awaited the approach of the enemy, having sent on an advance corps under the command of major Heath of the 5th regiment. This advance was met by that of the enemy, and after some skirmishing it returned to the line, the main body of the enemy being at a short distance in the rear of their advance. Between two and three o'clock, the enemy's whole force came up and commenced battle by some discharges of rockets, which were succeeded by the cannon from both sides, and soon after the action became general along the line. General Strieker gallantly main- tained his ground against a great superiority of numbers during the space of an hour and twenty minutes, when the regiment on his left (the fifty-first) giving way, he was under the necessity of re tiring to the ground in his rear, where he had stationed one regi- ment as a reserve. He here formed his brigade ; but the enemy not thinking it advisable to pursue, he, in compliance with previous arrangements, fell back and took post on the left of my intrench ments, and a half mile in advance of them. \" In this affair the citizen soldiers of Baltimore, with the excep-. tion of the fifty -first regiment, have maintained the reputation they so deservedly acquired at Bladensburg, and have given their coun try and their city an assurance of what may be expected from them when their services are again required. I cannot dismiss the subject without expressing the heartfelt satisfaction I experience in thus bearing testimony to the courage and good conduct of my fel low townsmen. About the time general Strieker had taken the ground just mentioned, he was joined by brigadier general Winder, who had been stationed on the west side of the city, but was now ordered to march with general Douglass' brigade of Virginia militia and the United States dragoons under captain Bird, and take. post on the left of general Strieker. During these movements, the. brigades of generals Stansbury and Foreman, the seamen and ma-"], [273, "APPENDIX. 249 rlnes under commodore Rodgers, the Pennsylvania volunteers under colonels Cobeau and Findley, the Baltimore artillery under colonel Harris, and the marine artillery under captain Stiles, manned the trenches and the batteries \u2014 all prepared to receive the enemy. We remained in this situation during the night. \" On Tuesday, the enemy appeared in front of my intrench ments, at the distance of two miles, on the Philadelphia road, from whence he had a full view of our position. He man\u0153uvred during the morning towards our left, as if with the intention of making a circuitous march, and coming down on the Hartford and York roads. Generals Winder and Strieker were ordered to adapt their movements to those of the enemy, so as to baffle this supposed in tention. They executed this order with great skill and judgment, by taking an advantageous position, stretching from my left across the country, when the enemy was likely to approach the quarter he seemed to threaten. This movement induced the enemy to concentrate his forces (between one and two o'clock) in my front, pushing his advance to within a mile of us, driving in our videttes, and showing an intention of attacking us that evening. I imme diately drew generals Winder and Strieker nearer to the left of my intrenchments, and to the right of the enemy, with the intention of their falling on his right or rear, should he attack me ; or if he de clined it, of attacking him in the morning. To this movement and to the strength of my defences, which the enemy had the fairest opportunity of observing, I am induced to attribute his retreat, which commenced at half past one o'clock on Wednesday morn ing. In this he was so favoured by the extreme darkness and a continued rain, that we did not discover it until daylight. I con sented to general Winder's pursuing with the Virginia brigade and the United States dragoons ; at the same time major Randal was despatched with his light corps in pursuit of the enemy's right, whilst the whole of the militia cavalry was put in motion for the same object. All the troops were, however, so worn out with continued watching, and with being under arms during three days and nights, exposed the greater part of the time to very inclement weather, that it was found impracticable to do any thing more than pick up a few stragglers. The enemy commenced his embarkation that evening, and completed it the next day at one o'clock. It would have been impossible, even had our troops been in a condition to act offensively, to have cut off any part of the enemy's rear guard during the embarkation, as the point where it was effected was defended from our approach by a line of defences extending from Back River to Humphrey's Creek on the Patapsco, thrown up by ourselves previous to their arrival. 32"], [274, "250 APPENDIX. \" I have now the pleasure of calling your attention to the brave* commander of fort M'Henry,* major Armstead, and to the opera- tions confined to that quarter. The enemy made his approach by water at the same time that his army was advancing on the land, and commenced a discharge of bombs and rockets at the fort as soon as he got within range of it. The situation of major Arm- stead was peculiarly trying \u2014 the enemy having taken his position at such a distance as to render offensive operations on the part of the fort entirely fruitless, while their bombs and rockets were every moment falling in and about it \u2014 the officers and men being at the same time entirely exposed. The vessels, however, had the temerity to approach somewhat nearer \u2014 they were as soon com- pelled to withdraw. During the night, whilst the enemy on land was retreating, and whilst the bombardment was the most severe, two or three rocket vessels and barges succeeded in getting up the Ferry Branch ; but they were soon compelled to retire, by the forts in that quarter, commanded by lieutenant Newcomb of the navy, and lieutenant AVebster of the flotilla. These forts also des- troyed one of the barges, with all on board. The barges and bat- tery at the Lazaretto, under the command of lieutenant Rutter of the flotilla, kept up a brisk and it is believed a successful fire dur ing the hottest period of the bombardment. The loss in fort M'Henry was four killed and twenty-four wounded, amongst the former I have to lament the fall of lieutenants Clagett and Clamm, who were both estimable citizens and useful officers. \" Of general Strieker's brigade, the number of killed and wound ed amounts to about one hundred and fifty \u2014 among the former this city has to regret the loss of its representative in the state legisla ture, James Lowry Donaldson, esquire, adjutant of the twenty seventh regiment. This gentleman will ever be remembered by his constituents for his zeal and talents, and by his corps for his bravery and military knowledge. \" I cannot conclude this report without informing you of the great aid I have derived from commodore Rodgers. He was ever present and ever ready to afford his useful counsel, and to render his im portant services. His presence, with that of his gallant officers and seamen, gave confidence to every one. \" The enemy's loss, in his attempt on Baltimore, amounts, as near as we can ascertain, to between six and seven hundred killed. wounded and missing.\" * Fort M'Henry is about two miles from the city of Baltimore."], [275, "251 APPENDIX. BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS. On the 27th December, general Jackson arrived at New Orleans with his army, where he immediately began the inspection of the different forts and works down the Mississippi river. On the morning of the 1st of January, the enemy had advanced within six hundred yards of our breast-works, under cover of night and a heavy fog, and erected three different batteries, mounting in all fifteen guns, from 6 's to 32's. About eight o'clock, when the fog cleared off, they commenced a most tremendous fire, which was amply return ed by our men, and a heavy cannonading was kept up, without the least interval on either side, except that occasioned by the explo sion of two small magazines, owing to their congreve rockets. At four o'clock, p. m. we had dismounted all their guns but two. During the night the enemy retreated to their strong holds, about a mile and a quarter from our lines. Our loss was eleven killed and twenty-three wounded : that of the enemy must have been much more. A 32 pounder from a battery commanded by commodore Patterson, killed fifteen at one shot. The Louisiana this day fired seven hundred shot. On the 2d of January, general Jackson received at New Orleans and its vicinity, reinforcements from Kentucky and Tennessee, amounting to three or four thousand, which, with his former force, gave him an army of between seven and eight thousand, of whom not more, however, than one half were armed. In consequence of the great number of men arriving with their arms in bad order, and of the scarcity of good muskets with bayonets, four companies of United States troops gave up theirs, amounting to about five hundred, to arm the men at the camp, and armed themselves with fowling pieces and pikes. On the 6th of January, sailing-master Johnson of the United States navy, with a launch and three small boats, manned with thirty-eight men, succeeded in burning a British transport brig on Lake Borgne, and in capturing a number of prisoners. The brig was laden with provisions and clothing. On the same day, twenty one sail of British vessels arrived off Cat island, upon the coast opposite the bay of St. Louis, with large reinforcements of troops, commanded by general Lambert. On the 7th, these troops were disembarked at the bayou Bienvenu : and lieutenant-general sir Edward Pakenham, (brother-in-law of lord Wellington) assumed command of the whole British army, amounting to twelve thousand inen."], [276, "252 APPENDIX. For two or three days previous to this, part of the forces of the enemy had been employed in preparing scaling ladders and collect- ing fascines (made of sugar canes) for their intended assault upon our lines ; while others were widening and deepening the canal which leads from the bayou Bienvenu toward the Mississippi, and which, on the evening of the 7th, was cut through to admit the river. Through this canal they floated or dragged twenty-four of their smaller boats, containing twenty-five men each, and thus transported about six hundred men to the opposite side of the river. Some distance above the spot where they landed, two batteries had been constructed and placed under the direction of commodore Patterson. The enemy's troops which had thus crossed, were intended to at- tack the commodore's batteries and create a diversion on that side of the river, while the main attack was carried on on the other side. Accordingly on the morning of the 8th, they silently drew out a large force to storm our lines, their columns advancing unper- ceived in the obscurity of the morning, to within about half a mile of our camp, where they met and drove in our piquet guard. About day-break they advanced with great vivacity to the intrenchment, led gallantly on by their officers ; when the intrepid Jackson and his brave men opened a most tremendous and deadly fire upon them from our works, which ended in a dreadful slaughter and total defeat of the enemy. General Jackson officially reports to the secretary at war an account of this battle in the following words: \u2014 Camp, 4 miles below Orleans, January 9, 1815. Sir, \u2014 During the days of the 6th and 7di, the enemy had been actively employed in making preparations for an attack on my lines. With infinite labour they had succeeded on the night of the 7th in getting their boats across from the lake to the river, by widen ing and deepening the canal on which they had effected their dis embarkation. It had not been in my power to impede these opera tions by a general attack ; added to other reasons, the nature of the troops under my command, mostly militia, rendered it too hazardous to attempt extensive offensive movements in an open country, against a numerous and well disciplined army. Although my forces, as to number, had been increased by the arrival of the Kentucky division, my strength had received very little addition ; a small portion only of that detachment being provided with arms. Compelled thus to wait the attack of the enemy, I took every measure to repel it when it should be made, and to defeat the object he had in view. General Morgan with the Orleans contingent, the Louisiana militia \u25a0and a strong detachment of the Kentucky troops, occupied an in trenched camp on the opposite side of the river, protected by"], [277, "253 APPENDIX. strong batteries on the bank, erected and superintended by com modore Patterson. In my encampment every thing was ready for action, when, early on the morning of the 8th, the enemy after throwing a heavy shower of bombs and congreve rockets, advanced their columns on my right and left, to storm my intrenchments. I cannot speak suf ficiently in praise of the firmness and deliberation with which the whole line received their approach \u2014 more could not have been ex pected from veterans inured to war. \u2014 For an hour, the fire of the small arms was as incessant and severe as can be imagined. The artillery, too, directed by officers who displayed equal skill and courage, did great execution. Yet the columns of the enemy con tinued to advance with a firmness which reflects the greatest credit. Twice the column which approached me on my left, was repulsed by the troops of general Carroll, those of general Coffee, and a divi sion of the Kentucky militia, and twice they formed again and re newed the assault. At length, however, cut to pieces, they fled in confusion from the field, leaving it covered with their dead and wounded. The loss which the enemy sustained on this occasion, cannot be estimated at less than fifteen hundred in killed, wounded and prison ers. Upwards of three hundred have already been delivered over for burial ; and my men are still engaged in picking them up within my lines and carrying them to the point where the enemy are to receive them. \u2014 This is an addition to the dead and wounded whom the enemy have been enabled to carry from the field, during, and since the action, and to those who have since died of the wounds they received. We have taken about five hundred prisoners, up wards of three hundred of whom are wounded, and a great part of them mortally. My loss has not exceeded, and I believe has not amounted to ten killed and as many wounded. The entire destruc tion of the enemy's army was now inevitable, had it not been for an unfortunate occurrence which at this moment took place on the other side of the river. Simultaneously with his advance upon my lines, he had thrown over in his boats a considerable force to the other side of the river. This having landed, was hardly enough to advance against the works of general Morgan ; and, what is strange and difficult to account for, at the very moment when its entire discomfiture was looked for with a confidence approaching to cer tainty, the Kentucky reinforcements, in whom so much reliance had been placed, ingloriously fled, drawing after them by their example, the remainder of the forces; and thus yielded to the enemy that most fortunate position. The batteries which had rendered me, for many days, the most import service, though bravely de fended, were of course now abandoned ; not, however, until the guns had been spiked."], [278, "254 APPENDIX. This unfortunate route had totally changed the aspect of affairs. The enemy now occupied a position from which they might annoy us without hazard, and by means of which they might have been enabled to defeat, in a great measure, the effects of our success on this side the river. It became therefore an object of the first con sequence to dislodge him as soon as possible. For this object, all the means in my power, which I could with any safety use, were. immediately put in preparation. Perhaps, however, it was owing somewhat to another cause that I succeeded even beyond my ex pectations. In negotiating the terms of a temporary suspension of hostilities to enable the enemy to bury their dead and provide for their wounded, I had required certain propositions to be acceded to as a basis ; among which this was one \u2014 that although hostilities should cease on this side the river until twelve o'clock of this day, yet it was not to be understood that they should cease on the other side ; but that no reinforcements should be sent across by either army until the expiration of that day. His excellency Maj. Gen. Lambert begged time to consider of these propositions until ten o'clock of to-day, and in the meantime recrossed his troops. I need not tell you with how much eagerness I immediately regained pos session of the position he had thus hastily quitted. In a subsequent letter, general Jackson states the loss of the ene my to have been much greater than what he had at first compu ted. Upon information which was believed to be correct, colo nel Haynes reported it to have been in total two thousand six hundred, viz. seven hundred killed, fourteen hundred wounded, and five hundred prisoners, including one major, four captains, eleven lieutenants and one ensign, who were among the latter. The Ame rican loss, on both sides of the Mississippi was thirteen killed, thir ty-nine wounded, and nineteen missing \u2014 total seventy-one. Of this number six were killed and seven wounded in the action on the eastern bank of the river, and the residue in a sortie after the action and in the action on the western bank. Among the British officers killed were Sir Edward Pakenham, lieutenant-general and com mander in chief, (cut asunder by a canon ball) major-general Gibbs, colonel Reyner, majors Pringle, Whitaker and Wilkinson. Among their wounded was major-general Keane, severely. Numerous accounts official as well as unofficial, represent this battle to have been the greatest ever fought on the American con tinent. For disparity of loss a parallel can scarcely be found in ancient or modern history. So determined were the enemy to carry our works, that many came up to the very muzzles of our guns, and some penetrated into our lines, where they were either killed or taken prisoners. Many fell mounting the breast-works ; other-"], [279, "APPENDIX. 255 were slain upon the works ; and the ditch in front was, in many places, literally silled with dead and wounded. The roar of artil- lery from our lines was incessant, while an unintermitted rolling fire was kept up from our muskets. The atmosphere was silled with sheets of sire and volumes of smoke. For an hour and a quarter the enemy obstinately continued the assault ; fresh men constantly ar- riving to sill up their lines thinned by our fire. Their determined perseverance and steady valour, were worthy of a better cause ; nor did their troops falter, until almost all the officers who had led them to the attack had fallen. At one time, a body of the enemy succeeded in gaining possession of a bastion on our right with three pieces of canon in it ; but so destructive was our fire, that every man who entered was either killed by our riflemen or disabled be- fore thy could spike the guns. Our men soon returned to the charge and regained the bastion. So intent were the enemy in getting over our works, that they pulled off their shoes for the purpose of climb- ing them ; but nearly all who made the attempt were either killed or taken prisoners. The guns of commodore Patterson's batteries, on the opposite side of the river, did great execution, until the retreat of the Ken- tucky troops, who had been posted near them. The commodore, finding himself thus deserted, was compelled, with a handful of brave men, to retire, after spiking his guns. The British afterwards burnt the gun carriages, being foiled in their expectations of using the guns to annoy our troops on the opposite shore. Previous to the battle of the 8th of January, the pirates of Ba- rataria, who had been held in custody, were released by order of general Jackson, upon condition that they would assist in defend- ing the city of New-Orleans. In the battle of that day they prov- ed themselves excellent artillerists, and were, together with a few Frenchmen, successfully employed in serving the pieces. They were afterwards released from any further confinement, having re- ceived (at the request of the general assembly of Louisiana) a full pardon from the president of the United States. Soon after the battle, the enemy sent in a flag of truce, and twenty-four hours were allowed them to remove and bury their dead. In one small spot alone, on the lest of our lines, they found three hundred and sixty-eight dead bodies. In the course of the day forty carts -and ten boats arrived at New-Orleans, loaded with wounded prisoners, who were put into the barracks, which were converted into temporary hospitals ; about one hundred and fifty unwounded prisoners were also put in confinement. \u2014 To the wound ed every attention was paid by the citizens ; the nuns of the con vent took the glorious lead. They, under the immediate superin- tendance of the Abbe Douburg, threw open their door- and convert-"], [280, "256 APPENDIX. ed all their houses, separated from their main building, into a hos pital, where they themselves, at their own expense, and with their own hands, took care of the sick and wounded. The ladies of New-Orleans were also employed in the same charitable acts of benevolence, as likewise in making clothes for our soldiers. The future historian will delight to contrast the destroying and brilliant virtues of the one sex, with the preserving and not less attracting virtues of the other. Immediately after their repulse, the enemy commenced active operations for a re-embarkation of their troops. Nearly the whole of the sick and wounded were sent on board their vessels, together with such baggage and munitions of war as could be safely spared. During these operations, the enemy kept up a menacing attitude \u2014 frequent indications were given of an intention to renew the attack on our lines, and vigorous works of defence were thrown up in front of our camp. The rear of their army retired first, while they dis played a numerous body of men to the view of our troops, and at night their fires seemed rather to increase than diminish. They had erected batteries to cover their retreat, in advantageous positions, from their original encampment, to the bayou through which they entered lake Borgne. The cannon placed on these batteries could have raked a pursuing army in every direction, and any attempt to storm them would have been attended with very great slaughter. Having made the necessary arrangements, the whole British army precipitately retreated on the night of the 18th of January ; an ac count of which was officially given by general Jackson to the sec retary of war. The enemy's loss after decampment, and on ship-board, (includ ing about three hundred drowned while passing to and from their shipping,) amount to four thousand eight hundred.* The American loss in the several engagements, was fifty-five kill ed, one hundred and eighty-five wounded, and ninety-three missing \u2014 total, three hundred and thirty-three. Of our forces actually engaged (including marines as well as land troops) the following is a correct statement : \u2014 In the action of the 28th of December, three thousand two hundred and eighty-two ; 1st of January, three thou sand nine hundred and sixty-one ; 8th of January, four thousand six hundred and ninety-eight. The enemy's force previous to the 6th of January, was nine thousand ; after that time it was increased to twelve thousand. * A number of British deserters and prisoners have stated their loss to have exceeded five thousand ; and it is worthy of remark, that the British official account of the action of the 8th of January represents it as very considerably surpassing the statement given by general Jackson."], [281, "257 APPENDIX. CRUISE OF THE PRESIDENT. On the 18th February, 1814, commodore Rodgers arrived at Sandy Hook in the United States frigate President from a cruise in the course of which she passed most of the West India Islands. After being off Charleston two days she was chased by a seventy four, two frigates, and several sloops of war. She had captured and sunk three British merchantmen, and taken on board thirty prisoners. One occurrence that took place during this cruise is truly de serving of record. Several strange sail were observed, and one large ship to the windward, that proved to be a seventy-four, which came down within gun shot. Commodore Rodgers had cleared ship for action, and continued with the main top-sail to the mast. After hauling her wind on the larboard tack, the enemy kept her distance, and the President remained three hours with her main top-sail to the mast. As the enemy evinced no disposition to en gage, the President gave her a shot to windward and hoisted colours \u2014 the seventy-four then bore up, and backed main top-sail when she had approached within gun shot. After mustering all hands aft, commodore Rodgers addressed them in a spirited and appropriate manner, and immediately gave orders to wear ship for the engagement. While backing to meet the cutter, and take a pilot on board, the commodore was surprised to observe the enemy standing off to the southward and eastward. A frigate and gun brig appearing in sight, he hauled in main and fore tacks and made for land. For the space of five hours the enemy had it at all times in his power to bring the President to action, and she lay in readiness with main top-sail aback and expecting him. Captain Lloyd who commanded the seventy-four which proved to be the Plantagenet, states that his crew was in a state of mutiny, and gives this as a reason for declining an engagement with the President. 33"], [282, "258 APPENDIX. ESCAPE OF THE CONSTITUTION FROM THE TENEDOS AND ENDYMION. On the 3d of April, 1814, the United States frigate Constitution, cap tain Stewart, arrived at Marblehead, having been chased in by the British frigates Tenedos and Endymion, of thirty-eight guns each, which had been in chase of her from daylight. The frigates, or one of them, it is said, got within two or three miles of the Con stitution, at one time, and to effect her escape she was obliged to throw overboard her provisions, &c. and every thing moveable, and started all her water. Some prize goods were likewise thrown over. She immediately anchored above fort Sewall, in a posture of de fence, her exposed situation rendering her liable to an attack, should she remain there long. In order to the protection of the frigate and the town, a number of heavy cannon were sent over from Salem, and major general Hovey issued an order for the Mar blehead battalion of artillery to hold itself in readiness to act. Commodore Bainbridge, to whom an express had been sent, des patched assistance from the navy yard in Charlestown, and the company of New England Guards began their march from Boston, to afford such aid as might be required of them. But towards evening the Constitution weighed anchor and came round into Salem harbour. [Sale?n Gazette."], [283, ""], [284, ""], [285, "APPENDIX. 259 PRIVATEER PRINCE OF NEUFCHATEL. On the 15th of October, 1814, the privateer Prince ofNeufchatel, commanded by captain Ordronaux, arrived at Boston from a cruise ; having on board 140 bales, 161 boxes, and 156 trunks of dry goods, 23 casks and 171 boxes sweet oil, a large quantity of coffee, rum, and various other articles, and twenty prisoners. Four days previous, at eight o'clock in the evening, while at an chor off the island of Nantucket, she was attacked by five heavy barges and launches containing one hundred and eleven men, from the British frigate Endymion, all well armed with pistols, boarding pikes, muskets, cutlasses and blunderbusses. A desperate engage ment ensued, the enemy made several attempts (o carry the priva teer by boarding, but were promptly met and repulsed At one time they had gained the deck of the vessel, when the Americans again rallied and drove them overboard. About twenty minutes from the commencement of the action, the enemy cried out for quarters, which were granted, and the action ceased. Of the five barges and launches, one was sunk, together with forty-sis of her crew, two only being saved ; three drifted off with the tide, apparently with no living soul on board, and one was taken possession of. She had thirty-six men at the commencement of the action, of which eight were killed and twenty wounded. One lieutenant, three midshipmen, and one master's mate were permitted to come on board, the remainder of the prisoners were kept in the launch astern all Bight, after taking out the arms, oars, &c, as the commander dare not trust them on board, having only eight men left fit for duty ; and having thirty-seven prisoners on board previous to the engagement. The privateer had only thirty-eight men, including officers, at quarters, of which six were killed, and twenty-four wounded, eight only remaining unhurt. The next morning the lieutenant, midshipmen, and master's mate signed a paper in behalf of themselves, the seamen and marines, pledging their honours, not to serve against the United States during the war, unless exchanged. They were then towed ashore at Nan tucket in the launch by the privateer's boat. Shortly after, captain Ordronaux sent fifteen of his other prisoners on shore, and placed them at the disposal of the marshal, as he did not care to trust them on board in his then enfeebled situation. He then got under way and arrived at Boston as before related. The commander of the frigate acknowledged he had lost as many men as he should have done if engaged with a vessel equal to his own, and gave great credit to the officers and crew of the privateer for their gallant defence. 34"], [286, "260 APPENDIX. BOMBARDMENT OF FORT M'HENRY. Some account of the attack on Baltimore has been given in the preceding pages, (see pages 247 \u2014 250.) The following particulars of the bombard- ment and defence of Fort M'Henry, are extracted from \" Niles's Weekly Register,\" vol. vii. p. 24. \" The attack on fort M'Henry was terribly grand and magnifi cent. The enemy vessels formed a great half circle in front of the works on the 12th September, 1814, but out of the reach of our guns and also those of the battery at the Lazaretto, on the opposite side of the great oove or basin, around the head of which the city of Baltimore is built. \" At six o'clock on Tuesday morning six bomb and some rock et vessels commenced the attack, keeping such a respectful distance as to make the fort rather a target than an opponent ; though major Armistead, the gallant commander, and his brave garrison fired oc casionally to let the enemy know the place was not given up. Four or five bombs were frequently in the air at a time, and, making a double explosion, with the noise of the rockets and the firings of the fort, Lazaretto, and our barges, created a horrible clatter. Thus it lasted until about three o'clock in the afternoon, when the enemy, growing more courageous, dropped nearer the fort, and gave the garrison and batteries a little of the chance they wanted. The balls now flew like hail-stones, and the Britons slipped their cables, hoisted their sails and were off in a moment, but not without damage. When they got out of harm's way they renewed the attack, throwing their bombs with an activity excited by their mor tification. So they went on until about one o'clock in the morning, our batteries now and then siring a single gun. At this time, aided by the darkness of the night and screened by a flame they had kindled, one or two rocket or bomb vessels and many barges, man- ned with twelve hundred chosen men, passed fort M'Henry and proceeded up the Patapsco, to assail the town and fort in the rear, and perhaps, effect a landing. The weak-sighted mortals now thought the great deed was done \u2014 they gave three cheers, and be- gan to throw their missive weapons. But, alas ! their cheering was quickly turned to groaning, and the cries of their wounded and drowning people soon reached the shore ; for forts M'Henry and Covington with the city battery and the Lazaretto and barges, vomited an iron flume upon them, in heated balls, and a storm of heavy bullets flew upon them from the great semi-circle of large guns and gallant hearts. The houses in the city were shaken to their foundations ; for never, perhaps from the time of the invention"], [287, "APPENDIX. 261 of cannon to the present day, were the same number of pieces fired with so rapid succession ; particularly from fort Covington where a party of commodore Rodger's really invincible crew was posted. Commodore Barney's flotilla-men, at the City Battery, maintained the high reputation they had before earned. The other vessels also began to fire \u2014 and the heavens were lighted with flame, and all was a continued explosion for about half an hour. Having got this taste of what was prepared for them, the enemy precipitately retired with his remaining force, battered and crippled, to his re spectful distance ; the darkness of the night and his ceasing to fire (which was the only guide our people had) preventing his annihila tion. All was for some time still- \u2014 the silence was awful \u2014 but being beyond danger some of his vessels resumed the bombard ment, which continued until morning \u2014 in all about twenty-four hours, during which there were thrown not less than fifteen hundred cf these great bombs, besides many rockets and some round shot, A few of these bombs fell short ; a large proportion burst over the fort, throwing their fragments among the garrison, and threatening destruction. Many passed over, and about four hundred fell within the works. \" The preservation of our people in the fort is calculated to ex cite in a wonderful manner our gratitude to that Great Being, with out whose knowledge ' a sparrow does not fall to the ground.' Only four were killed and about twenty-four wounded, and two or three hundred dollars will repair all the damages the fortresses sustained ! \" The admiral had fully calculated on taking the fort in two hours. Its surrender was spoken of as a matter of course. He said that when it was taken and the shipping destroyed, ' he would think about terms for the city !' All about and in the fort is such ample evidence of his zeal to perform his promise, that it seems impossible to believe that greater damage was not done than was really sustained. About nine o'clock on Wednesday morning, the enemy got under way and proceeded down the river. They must have suffered severely in this affair ; but what their loss really was. it is probable we never shall know.\""], [288, "262 APPENDIX. OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS. Extract of a letter from captain Thomas Truxton, to the Secretary of the Navy, dated on board the United States ship Constellation, in sight of the island of St. Christophers, February 10, 1799. Dear Sir, \u2014 I wrote you the 4th instant, to which I must beg leave to refer, and soon after weighed from Basseterre road, St. Christopher's, and proceeded to sea, having made the necessary arrangements with the merchants and masters of vessels for a con voy, to sail this day for the United States, under charge of the Nor folk and Richmond, which vessels I directed to cruise, in the mean time, near St. Bartholomew's and St. Martin's, so as to be at hand to proceed with the convoy at the time appointed. As soon as I left the road of Basseterre, (which I did with the Constellation so lus) I stretched under Montserat, and towards Guadaloupe by the wind, and from thence under the lee of Antigua and Barbuda. In this route I only met two merchant vessels and a British frigate. I therefore thought it best to change my ground, which I did, and run down towards the island of Nevis, and on the 9th instant, at noon, the island bearing w. s. w. five leagues distance, discovered a large ship to southward, on which I bore down. She hoisted Ame rican colours, and I made our private signals for the day, as well as that of the British, but finding she answered neither, I imme diately suspected her to be an enemy, and in a short time after found that my suspicions were well founded, for she hoisted the French national colours, and fired a gun to windward (which is a signal of an enemy.) I continued bearing down on her, and at a quarter past three, p. m. she hailed me several times ; and as soon as I got in a position for every shot to do execution, I answered by commencing a close and successful engagement, which lasted until about half past four, p. m. when she struck her colours to the United States ship Constellation, and I immediately took possession of her. She proved to be the celebrated French national frigate Insurgente, of 40 guns and 409 men, lately out from France, commanded by mon sieur Bureaus, and is esteemed one of the fastest sailing ships in the French navy. I have been much shattered in my rigging and sails, and my foretopmast rendered, from wounds, useless ; you may de pend the enemy is not less so. The high state of our discipline, with the gallant conduct of my officers and men, would have enabled me to have compelled a more"], [289, "APPENDIX. 263 formidable enemy to have yielded, had the fortune of war thrown one in my way; \u2014 as it is, I hope the president, and my country will, for the present, be content with a very sine frigate being added to our navy, and that too with the loss of only one man kil led, and two wounded, while the enemy had (the French surgeon reports) fifty-two or fifty-three killed and wounded. Several were found dead in the tops, &c. and thrown overboard eighteen hours after we had possession. I must not omit, in this hasty detail, to do justice to monsieur Bureaus, for he defended his ship manfully, and from my raking him several times fore and aft, and being athwart his stern ready with every gun to fire when he struck his colours, we may impute the conflict not being more bloody on our side ; for had not these advantages been taken, the engagement would not have ended so soon, for the Insurgente was completely officered and manned. Extract from captain Thomas Truxton, to the Secretary of the Navy, dated February 14, 1799. \" On the 13th, aster the greatest exertions having been made, we gained these roads with both ships, and anchored them safe about noon. It is impossible for me to state to you the joy demon strated by the inhabitants on this occasion ; the ship was filled with gentlemen of the first dignities in the island, and a salute requested, in order that it might be returned, which was complied with on my part, particularly as it came from a member of the king's council, Mr. Tryon, an old friend of mine of many years standing. \" I have just received a polite letter of congratulation from the commander in chief, who offers me every service in his power ; and I have directed all the wounded from the Insurgente to be im mediately landed, and sent to the hospital. \" The following is an accurate return made me this morning by lieutenant Rodgers, commanding the prize, taken from the examin ing officers, of the killed and wounded on board the Insurgente, viz. Killed, 29 Badly wounded, 22 Wounded more slightly, 19 Total killed and wounded, 70 \" We had, as I wrote you before, only one man killed,* and two badly wounded, one of which is since dead, the other is a mid shipman, Mr. M'Donough, who lost his foot ; an ordinary seaman was afterwards discovered to be slightly wounded ; this is the whole number lost and wounded on board the Constellation. * This man was killed by the 3d lieutenant, for leaving his quartern"], [290, "264 APPENDIX. \" I shall proceed to repair the damages sustained by both ship* as speedily as possible, and until the pleasure of the President of the United States is known, I intend to give lieutenant John Rodgers an order to command the Insurgente. He was one of the first lieu tenants appointed, has a claim to being among the first promotions, but a very strong one, for behaving well, and being the first lieutenant of the Constellation, at the capture of the first governmental ship of any consequence, ever made by the arms of the United States at sea since our being known as a nation ; the other officers I shall appoint in the some way. \" My gun deck is divided into three divisions, the first of five guns siid opposite, superintended by the first lieutenant, Mr. Rodgers. The second of five guns and opposite, by the second lieutenant, Mr. Cowper. The third of four guns and opposite, by the third lieutenant, Mr. Sterrett. The zeal of these three officers in performing their duty, and complying strictly with my orders, cannot be surpassed, but I must not, in praise of them, be sHent as to the good conduct of Mr. Shirly, the master, and Mr. Archer, the fourth lieutenant, who acted their part near my person on the quar ter deck, and who are also deserving of notice, \u2014 but for the honour of our nation, I must declare that it is impossible for officers and men in any service to have behaved better than my people did generally on this occasion ; it must therefore not be understood, because I have mentioned the names of a few of the principal gen tlemen, those of an inferior grade in their stations are less deserving ; on the contrary, to the latter I always felt most indebted for their exertions in the hour of battle, as they have generally much less at stake than those in higher stations, and consequently less inducement to display their valour.\" Copy of a letter from captain Thomas Truxton, to the Secretary of the Navy, dated United States ship Constellation, at sea, February 3, 1800. Sir, \u2014 On the 30th ultimo I left St. Christophers with the Con stellation in excellent trim, and stood to windward, in order to gain the station for myself, before the road of Guadaloupe, and at half past seven a. m. of the day following I discovered a sail to the s. e. to which I gave chase, and for the further particulars of that chase and the action after it, I must beg to refer to the extract from my journal herewith, as being the best mode of exhibiting a just and candid account of all our transactions in the late business, which has ended in the almost entire dismantlement of the Constellation : though I trust to the high reputation of the American flag. I have the honour to be, &c. THOMAS TRUXTON. Benj. Stoppard, Esq. Secretary of the Navr<"], [291, "265 APPENDIX. Occurrences on board the United States ship Constellation, of thirty-eight guns, under my command. February 1, 1800. Throughout these twenty-sour hours, very unsettled weather, kept on our tacks, beating up under Guadaloupe, and at half past seven a. m. the road of Basseterre bearing east five leagues distance saw a sail in the s. e. standing to the s. w. which from her situation, I at first took for a large ship from Martinico, and hoisted English colours on giving chase, by way of induce ment for her to come down and speak me, which would have saved us a long chase to leeward, off my intended cruising ground ; but finding she did not attempt to alter her course, I examined her more minutely, as we approached her, and discovered that she was a heavy French frigate, mounting at least fifty-four guns. I imme diately gave orders for the yards, &c. to be slung with chains, top sail sheets, &c. stoppered, and the ship cleared ; and every thing prepared for action, and hauled down the English colours. At noon the wind became light, and I observed the chase, that we had before been gaining fast on, held way with us, but I was deter mined to continue the pursuit, though the running to the leeward I was convinced would be attended with many serious disadvantages, especially if the object of my wishes were not gratified. Passed two schooners standing to the northward, one of them shewed American colours, and was a merchant vessel, and the other I supposed to be of the same description. February 2d, at one p. h. the wind being somewhat fresher, than at the noon preceding, and an appearance of its continuance, our prospect of bringing the enemy to action began again to brighten, as I perceived we were coming up with the chase fast, and every inch of canvass being set that could be of service, except the bog reefs, which I kept in the topsails, in case of the chase finding an escape from our thunder impracticable, should haul on a wind and give us fair battle ; but this did not prove to be her commander's intention. I however got within hail of him at eight p. m. hoisted our ensign, and had the candles in the battle lantherns all lighted, and the large trumpet in the lee gangway ready to speak him, and to demand the surrender of his ship to the United States of America ; but he at that instant commenced a sire from his stem and quarter guns directed at our rigging and spars. No parley being then necessary, I sent my principal aid de camp, Mr. Van dyke, to the different officers commanding divisions on the main battery, to repeat strictly my orders before given, not to throw away a single charge of powder, but to take good aim and fire directly into the hull of the enemy, and load principally with two round shot and now and then with a round shot, and a stand of grape, &c. to encourage the men at their quarters : lo cause or"], [292, "266 APPENDIX. Suffer no noise or confusion whatever ; but to load and fire as fast as possible when it could be done with certain effect. These orders being given, in a few moments I gained a position on his weather quarter, that enabled us effectually to return his salute ; and thus a close and as sharp an action as ever was fought between two frigates commenced and continued until within a few minutes of one, a. m. when the enemy's fire was completely silenced, and he was again sheering off. It was at that moment that I considered him as my prize, and was trimming in the best manner I could my much shattered sails ; when I found the mainmast was totally unsupported by rigging, every shroud being shot away, and some of them in several places ; that even stoppers were useless, and could not be applied with effect. I then gave orders for the officers to send the men up from the gun deck to endeavour to secure it, in order that we might get along side of the enemy again as soon as possible ; but every effort was in vain, for the mainmast went over the side in a few minutes after, and carried with it the top men, among whom was an amiable young gentleman who commanded the maintop, Mr. James Jarvis, son of James Jarvis, Esq. of New York. It seems this young gentleman was apprized of the mast going in a few mi nutes by an old seaman ; but he had already so much of the princi ple of an officer engrafted in his mind, not to leave his quarters on any account, that he told the man if the mast went they must go with it, which was the case, and only one of them was saved. I regret much his loss, as a promising officer and amiable young man, as well as on account of a long intimacy that has subsisted between his father and myself ; but have great satisfaction in finding I have no other ; and only two or three slightly wounded, out of the thirty -nine killed and wounded, fourteen of the former, and twenty -five of the latter. As soon as the mainmast went, every effort was made to clear the wreck from the ship as soon as possible, which was effected in about an hour. It being impossible to pursue the enemy, and as\" her security was then the great object, I immediately bore away for Jamaica for repairs, &c. finding it impossible to reach a friendly port in any of the islands to windward. I should be wanting in common justice, was I to omit here to journalize the steady attention to order, and the great exertion and bravery of all my officers, seamen and marines, in this action, many of whom I had sufficiently tried before on a similar occasion, and all their names are recorded in the muster roll I sent to the secretary of the navy, dated the 19th December last, signed by myself. All hands employed at repairing the damages sustained in the action, so far as to get the ship into Jamaica as soon as possible. THOMAS TRUXTON."], [293, "APPENDIX. 267 Captain Truxton's address to his officers and crew. Publick thanks though but a small tribute is nevertheless justly due to seamen, and soldiers, who have manifested their zeal, ac tivity and bravery so conspicuously, in support of the honour and dignity of their country's flag, as the crew of the Constellation, of thirty-six guns did last evening in an engagement with a French national frigate of fifty -four guns or upwards (carrying much heavier metal) in which the enemy was completely beaten, and would have become their prize, had the damages sustained in making the first efforts to get along side of her, together with the loss of the mainmast, main-top-mast, main-top-gallant-mast, mizzen-top-mast, and several other spars, which also went over the side at the mo ment of her sheering off, together with the dismantled state of the ship otherwise, made a further pursuit impracticable. As the commander, therefore, I feel infinite satisfaction in re turning my thanks to the officers of every description, seamen, ma rines, and others, for the gallantry they displayed on this occasion, which under a beneficent Providence, has enabled me to add another laurel to the American character, on the records of the Davy, and you may be assured gentlemen, seamen, and soldiers, that you shall be properly noticed to the President of the United States, and such of you as have been unfortunately wounded and survive, will no doubt be put on the pension list, and while their misfortunes I regret, I shall state with pleasure their just claims to the government, in order that they may have that protection and eare taken of them which is provided by a grateful country for those that the fortune of war has been unkind to.

Copy of a letter from captain Hull to the Secretary of the Navy, dated United States frigate Constitution, off Boston Light, August 30, 1812. Sir, \u2014 I have the honour to inform you, that on the 19th inst, at two p. m. being in latitude forty-one degrees forty-two minutes and longitude fifty-five degrees forty-eight minutes, with the Constitu tion under my command, a sail was discovered from the mast-head bearing e. by s. or e. s. e. but at such a distance we could not tell what she was. All sail was instantly made in chase, and soon found we came up with her. At three p. m. could plainly see, that she was a ship on the starboard tack under easy sail, close on a wind ; it half past three p. m. made her out to be a frigate ; continued the chase until we were within about three miles, when I ordered the hght sails te be taken in, the courses hauled up, and the ship cleared 35"], [294, "268 APPENDIX. for action. At this, time the chase had backed his maintop-saii. waiting for us to come down. As soon as the Constitution was ready for action, I bore down with intention to bring him to close action immediately ; but on our coming within gun-shot she gave us a broadside and filled away, and wore, giving us a broadside oh the other tack, but without effect ; her shot falling short. She con tinued wearing and man\u0153uvering for about three quarters of an hour, so get a raking position, but finding she could not, she bore up, and run under her top-sails and jib, with the wind on her quarter. I immediately made sail to bring the ship up with her, and five minutes before six p. m. being along side within half pistol-shot, we com menced a heavy fire from all our guns, double shotted with round and grape, and so well directed were they, and so warmly kept up, that in fifteen manutes his mizzen-mast went by the board and his main yard in the slings, and the hull, rigging, and sails very much torn to pieces. The fire was kept up with equal warmth for fifteen minutes longer, when his mainmast and foremast went, taking with them every spar, excepting the bowsprit. On seeing this we ceased firing, so that in thirty minutes after, we got fairly along side the enemy ; she surrendered, and had not a spar standing, and her hull below and above water so shattered, that a few more broadsides must have carried her down. After informing you, that so fine a ship as the Guerriere, com manded by an able and experienced officer, had been totally dis masted, and otherwise cut to pieces so as to make her not worth towing into port, in the short space of thirty minutes, you can have no doubt of the gallantry and good conduct of the officers and ship's company I have the honour to command ; it only remains therefore for me to assure you, that they all fought with great bravery ; and it gives me great pleasure to say, that from the smallest boy in the ship to the oldest seaman, not a look of fear was seen. They all went into action, giving three cheers, and requested to be laid close along side the enemy. Enclosed I have the honour to send you a list of killed and wound ed on board the Constitution, and a report of the damages she has sustained ; also a list of killed and wounded on board the enemy, with his quarter bill, &.c. \u2014 I have the honour to be, with very great respect, sir, your obedient servant, ISAAC HULL. Hon. Paul Hamilton, &c. Killed and wounded on board the Constitution. Killed \u2014 Wm. S. Bush, lieutenant marines, and six seamen. Wounded \u2014 Charles Morris, first lieutenant ; John C. Aylwin, mas ter ; four seamen and one marine. Total killed and wounded, fourteen. On board the Guerriere fifteen were killed and sixty-one wounded ."], [295, "APPENDIX. 269 Copy of a letter from captain Jones, to the Secretary of the Navy, dated New-York, 24th Nov. 1812. Sir, \u2014 I here avail myself of the first opportunity of informing you of the occurrences of our cruise, which terminated in the capture of the Wasp on the 18th of October, by the Poictiers of seventy four guns, while a reck, from damages received in an engagement with the British sloop of war Frolic, of twenty-two guns, sixteen of them 32 lb. carronades, and four 12 pounders on the main deck, and two 12 pounders, carronades, on the top-gallant forecastle, making her superior in force to us by four 12 pounders. The Frolic had struck to us, and was taken possession of about two hours before our surrendering to the Poictiers. We had left the Delaware on the 13th. The 15th had a heavy gale, in which we lost our jib-boom and two men. Half past eleven, on the night of the 17th, in latitude thirty-seven degrees north, and longitude sixty-five degrees west, we saw several sail, two of them appearing very large ; we stood from them some time, then shortened sail, and steered the remainder of the night the course we had per ceived them on. At day -light on Sunday the 18th, we saw them ahead ; gave chase, and soon discovered them to be a convoy of six sail under the protection of a sloop of war ; four of them large ships, mounting from sixteen to eighteen guns. At thirty-two minutes past eleven a. m. we engaged the sloop of war, having first received her fire, at the distance of fifty or sixty yards, which space we gradu ally lessened until we laid her on board, after a well supported fire of forty-three minutes ; and although so near while loading the last broadside that our rammers were shoved against the sides of the enemy, our men exhibited the same alacrity which they had done during the whole of the action. They immediately surrendered upon our gaining their forecastle, so that no loss was sustained on either side after boarding. Our main-top mast was shot away between four and five minutes from the commencement of the firing, and falling, together with the main topsail yard, across the larboard fore and fore topsail braces, rendered our head yards unmanageable the remainder of the action. At eight minutes the gaft and mizzen top-gallant mast came down, and at twenty minutes from the beginning of the action every brace and most of the rigging was shot away. A few minutes after separat ing from the Frolic, both her masts fell upon deck ; the mainmast going close by the deck, and the foremast twelve or fifteen feet above it. The courage and exertions of the officers and crew fully answered my expectations and wishes. Lieutenant Biddle's active conduct contributed much to our success, by the exact attention paid to every department during the engagement, aud the animating example he"], [296, "270 APPENDIX. afforded the crew by his intrepidity. Lieutenants Rodgers, Booth, and Mr. Rapp, shewed, by the incessant fire from their divisions, that they were not to be surpassed in resolution or skill. Mr. Knight, and every other officer, acted with a courage and promptitude highly honourable, and I trust have given assurance that they may be relied on whenever their services may be required. I could not ascertain the exact loss of the enemy, as many of the dead lay buried under the masts and spars that had fallen upon deck, which two hours' exertion had not sufficiently removed. -Mr. Bid dle, who had charge of the Frolic, states, that from what he saw, and from information from the officers, the number of killed must have been about thirty, and that of the wounded about forty or fifty. Of the killed is her first lieutenant, and sailing master ; of the wound ed, captain Whinyates, and the second lieutenant. We had five killed and five wounded, as per list : the wounded are recovering. Lieutenant Claxton, who was confined by sickness, left his bed a little previous to the engagement ; and though too indis posed to be at his division, remained upon deck, and showed by his composed manner of noting its incidents, that we had lost by his illness the services of a brave officer. I am respectfully yours, JACOB JONES. Hon. Paul Hamilton, Secretary of the Navy. Copy of a letter from commodore Decatur, to the Secretary of the Navy, dated United States ship United States, at sea, October 30, 1812. Sir, \u2014 I have the honour to- inform you, that on the 25th instant, being in latitude 29\u00b0 n. longitude 29\u00b0 30' w. we fell in with, and after an action of an hour and a half, captured his Britannick ma jesty's ship Macedonian, commanded by captain John Carden, and mounting 49 carriage guns, (the odd gun shifting.) She is a frigate of the largest class, two years old, four months out of dock, and reputed one of the best sailors in the British service. The enemy, being to windward, had the advantage of engaging us at his own distance, which was so great, that for the first half hour, we did not use our carronades, and at no moment was he within the complete effect of our musquetry and grape ; to this circumstance, and a heavy swell, which was on at the time, I ascribe the unusual length of the action. The enthusiasm of every officer, seaman, and marine, on board this ship, on discovering the enemy \u2014 their steady conduct in battle, and precision of their fire, could not be surpassed. Where all met my fullest expectations, it would be unjust in me to discriminate. Permit me, however, to recommend to your particular notice, my first lieutenant, William H. Allen. He has served with me upwards of five years, and so his unre'mitted exertions in disciplining the"], [297, "APPENDIX. 271 crew, is to be imputed the obvious superiority of our gunnery ex hibited in the result of this contest. Subjoined is a list of the killed and wounded on both sides. Our loss compared with that of the enemy, will appear small. Amongst our wounded you will observe the name of lieutenant Funk, who died a few hours after the action : he was an officer of great gal lantry and promise, and the service has sustained a severe loss in his death. The Macedonian lost her mizzen mast, fore and main topmasts and main yard, and was much cut up in her hull. The damage sus tained by this ship was not such as to render her return into port necessary ; and had I not deemed it important that we should see our prize in, should have continued our cruise. With the highest consideration and respect, I am, sir, your obe dient humble servant, STEPHEN DECATUR. Hon. Paul Hamilton. Killed and wounded on board the United States. Killed \u2014 Two seamen, two marines, and one boy. Wounded \u2014 John M. Funk, lieutenant ; one carpenter, four sea men, and one marine. Total killed and wounded, twelve. The Macedonian had one hundred and six men killed and wounded. Copy of a letter from commodore Bainbridge, to the Secretary of the Navy, dated United States frigate Constitution, St. Salvador, January 3, 1813. Sir, \u2014 I have the honour to inform you that on the 29th ultimo, at two p. m., in south latitude 13\u00b0 6', and west longitude 38\u00b0, and about ten leagues distant from the coast of Brazil, I fell in with and captured his Britannick majesty's frigate Java, of 49 guns and up- wards of four hundred men, commanded by captain Lambert, a very distinguished officer. The action lasted one hour and fifty-five mi- nutes, in which time the enemy was completely dismasted, not having a spar of any kind standing. The loss on board the Constitution, was nine killed and twenty-five wounded, as per enclosed list. The enemy had 60 killed and 101 wounded, certainly, (among the latter, captain Lambert, mortally) but by the enclosed letter, written on board this ship, by one of the officers of the Java, aud accidentally found, it is evident that the enemy's wounded must have been much greater than as above stated, and who must have died of their wounds previously to their being removed. The letter states sixty killed and one hundred and seventy wounded. For further details of the action, I beg leave to refer you to the \u25a0enclosed extracts from my Journal. The Java had, in addition to her own crew, upwards of one hundred supernumerary officers and"], [298, "272 APPENDIX. seamen to join the British ships of war in the East Indies : also lieutenant-general Hislop, appointed to the command of Bombay ; major Walker and captain Wood of his staff, and captain Marshall, master and commander in the British navy, going to the East Indies to take command of a sloop of war there. Should I attempt to do justice by representation to the brave and good conduct of all my officers and crew during the action, I should fail in the attempt ; therefore suffice it to say, that the whole of their conduct was such as to merit my highest encomiums. I beg leave to recommend the officers particularly to the notice of the government, as also the unfortunate seamen who were wounded, and the families of those brave men who fell in the action. The great distance from our own coast, and the perfect wreck we made the enemy's frigate, forbade every idea of attempting to take her to the United States ; I had therefore no alternative but burning her, which I did on the 31st ultimo, after receiving all the prisoners and their baggage, which was very hard work, only having one boat left out of eight, and not one left on board the Java. On blowing up the frigate Java, I proceeded to this place, where I have landed all the prisoners on their parole to return to England, and there remain until regularly exchanged, and not to serve in their professional capacities in any place, or in any manner what soever against the United States of America, until their exchange shall be effected. \u2014 I have the honour to be, &c. W. BAINBRIDGE. To the Secretary of the Navy. extract from commodore bainbridce's journal. \" Tuesday, December 29, 1812. \" At nine a. m. discovered two strange sails on the weather bow. At ten discovered the strange sails to be ships : one of them stood in for the land, and the other stood off shore, in a direction towards us. At forty-five minutes past ten a. m. we tacked ship to the northward and westward, and stood for the sail standing towards us .; at eleven, a. m. tacked to the southward and eastward, hauled up the mainsail and took in the royals. At thirty minutes past eleven, made the private signal for the day, which was not answered, and then set the mainsail and royals to draw the strange sail off from the neutral coast, and separate her from the sail in company. \" Wednesday, 30 December, (nautical time,) latitude thirteen degrees six minutes s., longitude thirty-one degrees w., ten leagues from the coast of Brazil, commenced with clear weather and mode rate breezes from e. s. e., hoisted onr ensign and pendant. At"], [299, "273 APPENDIX. fifteen minutes past meridian, the ship hoisted her colours, an Eng lish ensign, having a signal flying at main. \" At twenty-six minutes past one p. m. being sufficiently from the land, and finding the ship to be an English frigate, took in the mainsail and royals, tacked ship, and stood for the enemy. At fifty minutes past one p. m. the enemy bore down with an intention of raking us, which we avoided by wearing. At two p. m. the enemy being within half a mile of us, and to windward, and having hauled down his colours, except the union jack at the mizzenmast head, induced me to give orders to the officer of the third division to fire a gun ahead of the enemy, to make him shew his colours, which being done, brought on a fire from us of the whole broadside, on which the enemy hoisted his colours, and immediately returned our fire. A general action, with round and grape, then com menced ; the enemy keeping at a much greater distance than I wished ; but could not bring him to a closer action, without expos ing ourselves to several rakes. Considerable man\u0153uvres were made by both vessels to rake and avoid being raked. The following minutes were taken during the action : \" At ten minutes past two p. m. commenced the action within good grape and canister distance, the enemy to windward, (but much farther than I wished.) At thirty minutes past two, our wheel was shot entirely away. At forty minutes past two, deter mined to close with the enemy, notwithstanding his raking. Set the fore and mainsail, and luffed up close to him. At fifty minutes past two, the enemy's jib-boom got foul of our mizzen rigging. At three, the head of the enemy's bowsprit and jib-boom shot away by us. At five minutes past three, shot away the enemy's fore mast by the board. At fifteen minutes past three, shot away his main topmast just above the cap. At forty minutes past three, shot away the gaft and spanker boom. At fifty-five minutes past three, shot away his mizzen mast nearly by the board. At five minutes past four, having silenced the sire of the enemy completely, and his colours in the main rigging being down, we supposed he had struck ; we then hauled down courses and shot ahead to repair aur rigging, which was extremely cut ; leaving the enemy a com plete wreck : soon after discovered that the enemy's flag was still flying. Hove to, to repair some of our damage. At twenty minutes past four, the enemy's mainmast went nearly by the board. At fcsty minutes past four, wore ship and stood for the enemy. At twenty -five minutes past five, got very close to the enemy in a very effectual raking position, athwart his bows, and was at the very instant of raking him when he most prudently struck his flag \u2014 for had he suffered the broadside to have raked him, his additional loss must have been extremely great, as he laid as an unmanageable wreck upon the water.''"], [300, "274 APPENDIX. Copy of a letter from captain Lawrence to the Secretary of the Navy, dated U. S. ship Hornet, Holmes's Hole, March 19, 1813. Sir, \u2014 I have the honour to inform you of the arrival at this port of the United States ship Hornet, under my command, from a cruise Of 145 days ; and to state to you, that after commodore Bainbridge left the coast of Brazils, (Jan. 6) I continued off the harbour of St. Salvador, blockading the Bonne Citoyenne, until the 24th, when the Montague 74 hove in sight, and chased me into the harbour ; but night coming on, I wore and stood out to the southward. Knowing that she had left Rio Janeiro for the express purpose of relieving the Bonne Citoyenne and the packet, [which I had also blockaded for fourteen days, and obliged her mail to go to Rio, in a Portuguese smack] I judged it most prudent to shift my cruis ing ground, and hauled by the wind to the eastward, with the view of cruising off Pernambuco, and on the 4th of February captured the English brig Resolution, of ten guns, from Rio Janeiro, bound to Morahnam, with coffee, jerked beef, flour, fustic, and butter, and about twenty-three thousand dollars in specie. As she sailed dull and I could not spare hands to man her, I took out the money and set her on fire. I ran down the coast of Morahnam, and cruised there a short time : from thence ran off Surinam. After cruising off that coast from the 15th to the 22d of February without meet ing a vessel, I stood for Demerara, with an intention, should I be fortunate on that station, to run through the West Indies, on my way to the United States. But, on the 24th in the morning, I dis covered a brig to the leeward, to which I gave chase ; ran into quarter less four, and not having a pilot, was obliged to haul off, the fort at the entrance of Demerara river at this time bearing s. w. distant about two and a half leagues. Previous to giving up the chase, I discovered a vessel at anchor without the bar, with English colours flying, apparently a brig of war. In beating round Coro bano Bank, in order to get at her, at half past 3 p. m. discovered another sail on our weather quarter, edging down for us. At twenty minutes past four, she hoisted English colours, at which time we discovered her to be a large man-of-war brig \u2014 beat to quarters, cleared ship for action, and kept close by the wind, in order, if possible, to get the weathergage. At ten minutes past five, find ing I could weather the enemy, I hoisted American colours and tacked. At twenty-five minutes past five, in passing each other, exchanged broadsides within half pistol shot. Observing the enemy in the act of wearing, I bore up, received his starboard broadside, ran him close on board the starboard quarter, and kept up such a heavy and well directed fire, that in less than fifteen minutes ho surrendered, being literally cut to pieces, and hoisted his ensign, union down, from his fore-rigging, as a signal of distress. Shortly"], [301, "APPENDIX. 275 after, his mainmast went by the board. Despatched lieutenant Shubrick on board, who soon returned with her first lieutenant, who reported her to be his Britannick Majesty's late brig Peacock, com manded by captain William Peake, who fell in the latter part of the action ; that a number of her crew were killed and wounded, and that she was sinking fast, having then six feet water in her hold. Despatched the boats immediately\" for the wounded, and brought both vessels to anchor. Such shot holes as could be got at were then plugged up : her guns thrown overboard, and every possible exertion used to keep her afloat until the prisoners could be removed, by pumping and bailing, but without effect, as she unfortunately sunk in five and a half fathoms water, carrying down thirteen of her crew, and three of my brave fellows, viz. : John Hart, Joseph Williams and Hannibal Boyd ; lieutenant Conner, midshipman Cooper, and the remainder of my men, employed in removing the prisoners, with difficulty saved themselves, by jumping into a boat that was lying on her booms as she went down. Four men of the thirteen mentioned, were so fortunate as to gain the fore top, and were afterwards taken off by the boats. Previous to her going down, four of her men took the stern boat, that had been much damaged during the action, who, I sincerely hope, reached the shore in safety ; but from the heavy sea running at the time, the shattered state of the boat, and the difficulty of landing on the coast, I am fearful they were lost. I have not been able to ascertain from her officers the exact number killed. Captain Peake and four men were sound dead on board. The master, and one midshipman, carpenter and captain's clerk, and twenty-nine seamen were wound ed ; most of them severely, three of them died of their wounds aster being removed, and nine drowned. Our loss was trifling in compari son. John Place, killed ; Samuel Coulson, and John Delyrumple se verely wounded ; George Coffin and Lewis Todd severely burnt by the explosion of a cartridge. Todd survived only a few days. Our rigging and sails are much cut. One shot through the foremast ; and the bowsprit slightly injured. Our hull received little or no damage. At the time I brought the Peacock to action, the L'Es piegle (the brig mentioned as being at anchor) mounting sixteen thirty-two pound carronades and two long nines, lay about six miles in shore of me, and could plainly see the whole of the action. Apprehensive that she would beat out to the assistance of her con sort, such exertions were made by my officers and crew repairing damages, &c. that by nine o'clock my boats were stowed away, new set of sails bent, and the ship completely ready for action. At 2 a. m. got under way and stood by the wind to the northward and westward, under easy sail. On mustering next morning, found we had two hundred and 'pventy-seven souls on board, including the crew of the American 36"], [302, "276 APPENDIX. brig Hunter, of Portland, taken a few days since by the Peacock. As we had been on two thirds allowance of provisions, for some time, and had but 3,400 gallons of water on board, I reduced the allowance to three pints a man, and determined to make the best of my way to the United States. The Peacock was deservedly styled one of the finest vessels ot her class in the British navy. I should judge her to be about the tonnage of the Hornet. Her beam was greater by five inches ; but her extreme length not so great by four feet. She mounted sixteen twenty-four pound carronades, two long nines, one twelve pound carronade on her top-gallant forecastle, as a shifting gun, and one sour or six pounder, and two swivels mounted aft. I find, by her quarter bill, that her crew consisted of one hundred and thirty-four men, four of whom were absent in a prize. The cool and determined conduct of my officers and crew during the action, and their almost unexampled exertions afterwards, en title them to my warmest acknowledgments, and I beg leave most earnestly to recommend them to the notice of government. By the indisposition of lieutenant Stewart, I was deprived of the services of an excellent officer. Had he been able to stand the deck, I am sure his exertions would not have been surpassed by any one on board. I should be doing injustice to the merits of lieutenant Shubrick, and acting lieutenants Conner and Newton, were I not to recommend them particularly to your notice. Lieu tenant Shubrick was in the actions of the Guerriere and Java. Cap tain Hull and Commodore Bainbridge can bear testimony of his coolness and good conduct on both occasions. I have the honour to be, sir, your obedient servant, JAMES LAAVRENCE. Hon. Wm. Jones, Secretary of the Navy. P. S. At the commencement of the action, my sailing-master and seven men were absent in a prize ; and lieutenant Stewart and six men were on the sick list. Copy of a letter from lieutenant Budd to the Secretary of the Navy, dated Halifax, June 15, 1813. Sir, \u2014 The unfortunate death of captain James Lawrence, and lieutenant Augustus C. Ludlow, has rendered it my duty to inform you of the capture of the late United States frigate Chesapeake. On Tuesday June 1st, at eight a. m. we unmoored ship, and at meridian got under way from President's roads, with a light wind from the southward and westward, and proceeded on a cruise. A ship was then in sight in the offing, which had the appearance of a ship of war, and which, from information received from pilot boats"], [303, "APPENDIX. 277 and craft, we believed to be the British frigate Shannon. We made sail in chase and cleared ship for action. At half past sour p. m. she hove to, with her head to the southward and eastward. At five p. m. took in the royals and top-gallant sails, and at half past five hauled the courses up. About fifteen minutes before six p. m. the action commenced within pistol shot. The first broadside did great execu tion on both sides, damaged our rigging, killed among others Mr. White, the sailing master, and wounded captain Lawrence. In about twelve minutes after the commencement of the action, we fell on board of the enemy, and immediately after, one of our arm chests on the quarter deck was blown up by a hand grenade, thrown from the enemy's ship. In a few minutes one of the captain's aids came on the gun deck to inform me thnt the boarders were called. I im mediately called the boarders away, and proceeded to the spar deck, where I sound that the enemy had succeeded in boarding us, and had gained possession of our quarter deck. I immediately gave order? to haul on board the foretack, for the purpose of shooting the ship clear of the other, and then made an attempt to regain the quarter deck, but was wounded and thrown down on the gun deck. I again made an effort to collect the boarders, but in the mean time the enemy had gained complete possession of the ship. On my being carried down to the cockpit, I there found captain Lawrence and lieutenant Lud low both mortally wounded ; the former had been carried below previously to the ship's being boarded ; the latter was wounded in attempting to repel the boarders. Among those who fell early in the action was Mr. Edward J. Ballard, the fourth lieutenant, and lieutenant James Broom of marines. I herein enclose to you a return of the killed and wounded, by which you will perceive that every officer, upon whom the charge of the ship would devolve, was either killed or wounded previously to her capture. The enemy report the loss of Mr. Watt, their first lieutenant ; the purser ; the captain's clerk, and twenty -three seamen killed ; and captain Broke, a midshipman, and fifty-six seamen wounded. The Shannon had, in addition to her full complement, an officer and sixteen men belonging to the Belle Poule, and a part of the crew belonging to the Tenedos. \u2014 I have the honour to be, with very great respect, &c.

Copy of a letter from lieutenant AVatson, first of the late United States brig Argus, to the Secretary of the Navy, dated Norfolk, March 2, 1815. Sir, \u2014 Circumstances during my residence in England having here- tofore prevented my attention to the painful duty which devolved on me by the death of my gallant commander, captain William H. Allen, of the late United States brig Argus, I have now the honour to state for your information, that having landed the minister plenipotentiary (Mr. Crawford) and suite at L'Orient, we proceeded on the cruise which had been directed by the department, and after capturing twenty vessels, (a list of the names and other particulars of which I have the honour to enclose,) being in latitude fifty-two degrees fifteen minutes n., longitude five degrees fifty minutes w. on the 14th Au- gust, 1813, we discovered at four o'clock a. m. a large brig of war standing down under a press of sail upon our weather quarter, the wind being at south, and the Argus close hauled on the starboard tack : we immediately prepared to receive her ; and at thirty minutes after four, being unable to get the weathergage, we shortened sail, and gave her an opportunity of closing. At six, the brig having dis- played English colours, we hoisted our flag; wore round, and gave her the larboard broadside, (being at this time within grape distance) which was returned, and the action commenced within the range of musketry. At sour minutes after six, captain Allen was wounded, and the enemy shot away our main braces, main spring-stay, gaff, and trysail-mast. At eight minutes after six, captain Allen, being much exhausted by the loss of blood, was taken below. At twelve minutes aster six, lost our spritsail-yard and the principal part of the standing rigging on the larboard side of the foremast. At this time I received a wound on the head from a grape shot, which for a time rendered me incapable of attending to duty, and was carried below ; I had, however, the satisfaction of recollecting on my recovery, that"], [305, "279 APPENDIX. nothing which the most gallant exertions could effect, would be left undone by lieutenant W. H. Allen, jun. who succeeded to the com mand of the deck. Lieutenant Allen reports, at fourteen minutes after six, the enemy, being in our weather quarter, edged off, for the purpose of getting under our stern, but the Argus luffed close to, with the main topsail aback, and giving him a raking broadside, frustrated his attempt. At eighteen minutes aster six, the enemy shot away our preventer,main braces and main-topsail-tie ; and the Argus having lost the use of her after sails, fell on before the wind, when the enemy succeeded in pass ing ourstern,and rangedon the starboard side. At twenty-five minutes after six, the wheel ropes and running rigging of every description being shot away, the Argus became unmanageable ; and the enemy, not having sustained any apparent damage, had it completely in his power to choose a position, and continued to play upon our starboard quarter, occasionally shifting his situation, until thirty minutes after six, when I returned to the deck, the enemy being under our stern, within pistol shot, where she continued to rake us until thirty -eight minutes after six, when we prepared to board, but, in consequence of our shattered condition, were unable to effect it; the enemy then passed our broadside, and took a position on our starboard bow. From this time until forty-seven minutes after six, we were exposed to a cross or raking fire, without being able to oppose but little more than musketry to the broadside of the enemy, our guns being much disabled and seldom brought to bear. The Argus having now suffered much, in hull and rigging, as also in killed and wounded, among the former of whom (exclusive of our gallant captain) we have to lament the loss of two meritorious voung officers in midshipmen Delphy and Edwards ; and being ex posed to a galling fire, which from the enemy's ability to manage his vessel, we could not avoid, I deemed it necessary to surrender, and was taken possession of by his Britannick majesty's sloop the Pelican, of twenty-one carriage guns, viz. sixteen 32 pound carron ades, four long 6's, and one 12 pound carronade. I hope this mea sure will meet your approbation, and that the result of this action, when the superior size and metal of our opponent, and the fatigue which the crew, &c. of the Argus underwent from a very rapid suc cession of captures, is considered, will not be thought unworthy of the flag under which we serve. I have the honour to enclose a list of killed and wounded, and feel great satisfaction in reporting the general good conduct of the meritorious officers engaged on this occasion, and particularly the zeal and activity displayed by lieutenant Allen, who you will ob serve for a time commanded on deck.\u2014 I have the honour to be, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant, _ W.

Copy of a letter from commodore Perry to the Secretary of the Navy, dated United States schooner Ariel, Put-in-Bay, September 13, 1813. Sin, \u2014 In my last I informed you that we had captured the ene my's fleet on this lake. I have now the honour to give you the most important particulars of the action. On the morning of the 10th instant, at sunrise, they were discovered from Put-in-Bay, where I lay at anchor with the squadron under my command. AYe got under way, the wind light at s. w. and stood for them. At ten a. m. the wind hauled to s. e. and brought us to windward ; formed the line and bore up. At fifteen minutes before twelve, the enemy com menced firing ; at five minutes before twelve, the action commenced on our part. Finding their sire very destructive, owing to their long guns, and its beinor mostly directed at the Lawrence, I made sail and"], [307, "APPENDIX. \u25a0 281 directed the other vessels to follow for the purpose of closing with the enemy. Every brace and bow-line being shot away, she became unmanageable, notwithstanding the great exertions of the sailing master. In this situation she sustained the action upwards of two hours within canister distance, until every gun was rendered useless, and the greater part of her crew either killed or wounded. Finding she could no longer annoy the enemy, I lest her in charge of lieutenant Yarnall, who I was convinced, from the bravery already displayed by him, would do what would comport with the honour of the flag. At half past two, the wind springing up, captain Elliott was enabled to bring his vessel, the Niagara, gallantly into close action ; I immediate ly went on board of her, when he anticipated my wish by volunteering to bring the schooners which had been kept astern by the lightness of the wind, into close action. It was with unspeakable pain, that I saw, soon after I got on board the Niagara, the flag of the Lawrence came down, although I was perfectly sensible that she had been de fended to the last, and that to have continued to make a show of resistance would have been a wanton sacrifice of the remains of her brave crew. But the enemy was not able to take possession of her, and circumstances soon permitted her flag again to be hoisted. At forty -five minutes past two, the signal was made for \" close action.\" The Niagara being very little injured, I determined to pass through the enemy's line, bore up and passed ahead of their two ships and a brig, giving a raking fire to them from the starboard guns, and to a large schooner and sloop from the larboard side at half pistol shot distance. The smaller vessels at this time having got within grape and canister distance, under the direction of cap tain Elliott, and keeping up a well directed fire, the two ships, a brig and a schooner surrendered, a schooner and sloop making a vain attempt to escape. Those officers and men who were immediately under my obser vation evinced the greatest gallantry, and I have no doubt that all others conducted themselves as became American officers and sea men. Lieutenant Yarnall, first of the Lawrence, although several times wounded, refused to quit the deck. Midshipman Forrest, (doing duty as lieutenant,) and sailing-master Taylor, were of great assistance to me. I have great pain in stating to you the death ol lieutenant Brooks of the marines, and midshipman Laub, both of the Lawrence, and midshipman John Clarke of the Scorpion : they were valuable and promising officers. Mr. Hambleton, purser, who vo lunteered his services on deck, was severely wounded late in the ac tion. Midshipmen Claxon and Swartwout of the Lawrence, were severely wounded. On board of the Niagara, lieutenants Smith and Edwards, and midshipman Webster, (doing duty as sailing-master.) behaved in a very handsome manner. Captain Breevoort \u00bbf the"], [308, "282 APPENDIX. army, who acted as a volunteer in the capacity of a marine officer, on board that vessel, is an excellent and brave officer, and with his musketry did great execution. Lieutenant Turner, commanding the Caledonia, brought that vessel into action in the most able manner, and is an officer that in all situations may be relied on. The Ariel, lieutenant Packet, and Scorpion, sailing-master Champ- lin, were enabled to get early into action, and were of great ser- vice. Captain Elliott speaks in the highest terms of Mr. Magrath, purser, who had been despatched in a boat on service previous to my getting on board the Niagara ; and, being a seaman, since the action has rendered essential service in taking charge of one of the prizes. Of captain Elliott, already so well known to the govern- ment, it would be almost superfluous to speak. In this action he evinced his characteristick bravery and judgment, and, since the close of the action, has given me the most able and essential assistance. I have the honour to enclose you a return of the killed and wounded, together with a statement of the relative force of the squadrons. The captain and first lieutenant of the Queen Charlotte and the first lieutenant of the Detroit were killed : captain Barclay, senior officer, and the commander of the Lady Prevost, severely wounded : the commander of the Hunter and Chippeway slightly wounded. Their loss in killed and wounded I have not yet been able to ascertain ; it must however have been very great, Very respectfully, I have the honour to be, sir, your obedient servant, O. H. PERRY.

Sir, \u2014 I have done myself the honour to address you repeatedly, since I left the Delaware ; but have scarcely a hope that one of my letters has reached you ; therefore, consider it necessary to give a brief history of my proceedings since that period. I sailed from the Delaware on the 27th of October 1812, and repaired, with all diligence, (agreeably to instruction from commo dore Bainbridge) to Port Praya, Fernando de Noronho, and Cape Frio ; and arrived at each place on the day appointed to meet him. On my passage from Port Praya to Fernando de Noronho, I cap tured his Britannick majesty's packet Nocton ; and after taking oul about eleven thousand pounds sterling in specie, sent her under command of lieutenant Finch for America. I cruised off Rio de Janeiro, and about Cape Frio, until the 12th January 1813, hearing"], [309, "APPENDIX. 283 frequently of the commodore, by vessels from Bahia. I here captured but one schooner, with hides and tallow. I sent her into Rio. The Montague, the admiral's ship, being in pursuit of me, my provisions now getting short, and finding it necessary to look out for a supply, to enable me to meet the commodore by the 1st of April off St. Helena, I proceeded to the Island of St. Catharines, (the last place of ren dezvous on the coast of Bra2il) as the most likely to supply my wants, and at the same time afford me that secrecy necessary to enable me to elude the British ships of war on the coast, and ex pected there. I here could procure only wood, water and rum, and a few bags of flour ; and hearing of the commodore's action with the Java, the capture of the Hornet by the Montague, and a considerable augmentation of the British force on the coast, and of several being in pursuit of me, I found it necessary to get to sea as soon as possible. I now, agreeably to the commodore's plan, stretch ed to the southward, scouring the coast as far as Rio de la Plata. I heard that Buenos Ayres was in a state of starvation, and could not suppy our wants ; and that the government of Montevideo was very inimical to us. The commodore's instructions now left it dis cretionary with me what course to pursue, and I determined on following that which had not only met his approbation, but the ap probation of the then secretary of the navy. I accordingly shaped my course for the Pacific ; and after suffering greatly from short allowance of provisions and heavy gales off Cape Horn (for which my ship and men were illy provided) I arrived at Valparaiso on the 14th March, 1813. I here took in as much jerked beef, and other provisions, as my ship would conveniently stow, and run down the coast of Chili and Peru ; in this track, I fell in with a Peruvian corsair, which had on board twenty-four Americans as prisoners, the crews of two whale ships, which she had taken on the coast of Chili. The captain informed me, that as the allies of Great Britian, they would capture all they should meet with, in expectation of a war be tween Spain and the United States. I consequently threw all his guns and ammunition into the sea, liberated the Americans, wrote a respectful letter to the Vice Roy, explaining the cause of my pro ceedings, which I delivered to her captain. I then proceeded for Lima, and re-captured one of the vessels as she was entering the port. From thence I proceeded for the Gallapagos islands, where I cruised from the 17th April, until the 3d October, 1813; during which time I touched only once on the coast of America, which was for the purpose of procuring a supply of fresh water, as none is to be sound among those islands ; which are perhaps the most barren and desolate of any known. While among this groupe, I captured the following British ships, employed chiefly in the spermaceti whale fishery \u2014 viz. 37"], [310, "284 APPENDIX. LETTERS OF MARO.UE. Tons. Men. Guns.

Hammond, 301 31- 12 18 3369 302 107 As some of those ships were captured by boats, and others by prizes, my officers and men had several opportunities of showing their gallantry. The Rose and Charlton were given up to the prisoners ; the Hector, Catharine, and Montezuma, I sent to Valparaiso, where they were laid up ; the Policy, Georgiana, and New Zealander I sent for Ame rica ; the Greenwich I kept as a store ship, to contain the stores of my other prizes, necessary for us ; and the Atlantic, now called the Essex-Junior, I equipped with twenty guns, and gave command of her to lieutenant Downes. Lieutenant Downes had convoyed the prizes to Valparaiso, and on his return brought me letters informing me, that a squadron un der the command of commodore James Hillyar, consisting of the frigate Ph\u0153be, of thirty-six guns, the Racoon and Cherub sloops of war, and a store ship of twenty guns, had sailed on the 6th of July for this sea. The Racoon and Cherub had been seeking me for some time on the coast of Brazil, and on their return from their cruise, joined the squadron sent in search of me to the Pacific. My ship, as it may be supposed, after being near a year at sea, re quired some repairs to put her in a state to meet them ; which I determined to do, and to bring them to action, if I could meet them on nearly equal terms. I proceeded now, in company with the remainder of my prizes, to the island of Nooaheevah, or Madison Island, lying in the Washington groupe, discovered by captain Ingra ham of Boston : here I caulked and completely overhauled my ship, made for her a new set of water casks, her old ones being entirely decayed, and took on board from my prizes provisions and stores for upwards of four months, and sailed for the coast of Chili on the"], [311, "285 APPENDIX. 12th December, 1813. Previous to sailing, I secured the Seringa patam, Greenwich, and Sir Andrew Hammond under the guns of a battery, which I erected for their protection. After taking posses sion of this fine island for the United States, and establishing the most friendly intercourse with the natives, I left them under the charge of lieutenant Gamble of the marines, with twenty-one men, with orders to repair to Valparaiso, after a certain period. I arrived on the coast of Chili on the 12th January, 1814 ; looked into Conception and Valparaiso, found at both places only three English vessels, and learned that the squadron, which sailed from Rio de Janeiro for that sea, had not been heard of since their depar ture ; and were supposed to be lost in endeavouring to double Cape- Horn. I had completely broken up the British navigation in the Pacific : the vessels which had not been captured by me, were laid up, and dared not venture out. I had afforded the most ample protection to our own vessels, which were, on my arrival, very numerous and unprotected. The valuable whale fishery there is entirely destroy ed, and the actual injury we have done them may be estimated at two and a half millions of dollars, independent of the expenses of the vessels in search of me. They have furnished me amply with sails, cordage, cables, anchors, provisions, medicines, and stores of every description ; and the slops on board them have furnished clothing for the seamen. We have in fact lived on the enemy since I have been in that sea, every prize having proved a well found store-ship for me. I had not yet been under the necessity of draw ing bills on the department- for any object, and had been enabled to make considerable advances to my officers and crew on account of pay. For the unexampled time we had kept the sea, my crew had been remarkably healthy : I had but one case of the scurvy ; and had lost only the following men by death, viz, John S. Cowan, lieutenant ; Robert Miller, surgeon ; Levi Holmes, Edward Sweeney, ordinary seamen ; Samuel Groce, seaman ; James Spafford, gunner's mate ; Benjamin Geers, John Rodgers, quarter-gunners ; Andrew Mahan, corporal of marines ; Lewis Price, private marine. I had done all the injury that could be done the British com merce in the Pacific, and still hoped to signalize my cruise by something more splendid before leaving that sea. I thought it not improbable that commodore Hillyar might have kept his arrival secret, and believing that he would seek me at Valparaiso, as the most likely place to find me. I therefore determined to cruise about that place, and should I fail of meeting him, hoped to be compen sated by the capture of some merchant ships, said to be expected from England. . The Ph\u0153be, agreeably to my expectations, came to seek me at"], [312, "286 APPENDIX. Valparaiso, where I was anchored with the Essex, and my armed prize the Essex-Junior, under the command of lieutenant Downes, on the look out of the harbour; but, contrary to the course I thought he would pursue, commodore Hillyar brought with him the Cherub sloop of war, mounting twenty-eight guns, eighteen 32 pound carronades, eight 24's, and two long 9's on the quarter deck and forecastle, and a complement of one hundred and eighty men. The force of the Ph\u0153be is as follows: \u2014 thirty long 18 pounders, sixteen 32 pound carronades, one howitzer, and six 3 pounders in the tops, in all fifty-three guns, and a complement of three hundred and twenty men ; making a force of eighty-one guns and five hundred men ; in addition to which, they took on board the crew of an English letter-of-marque laying in port. Both ships had picked crews, and were sent into the Pacifick in company with the Racoon of twenty-two guns, and a store ship of twenty guns, for the express purpose of seeking the Essex, and were prepared with flags, bearing the motto, \" God and country ; British sailors' best rights ; traitors offend both.\" This was in tended as a reply to my motto, \" Free trade and sailors' rights,\" under the erroneous impression that my crew were chiefly English men, or to counteract its effect on their own crews. The force of the Essex was forty-six guns, forty 32 pound carronades, and six long 12's, and her crew, which had been much reduced by prizes, amounted only to two hundred and fifty-five men. The Essex- Junior, which was intended chiefly as a store ship, mounted twenty guns, ten 18 pound carronades, and ten short 6's, with only sixty men on board. In reply to their motto, I wrote at my mizzen, \" God, our country, and liberty ; tyrants offend them.\" On getting their provisions on board, they went off the port for the purpose of blockading me, where they cruised for near six weeks ; during which time I endeavoured to provoke a challenge, and frequently, but ineffectually, to bring the Ph\u0153be alone to ac tion, first with both my ships, and afterwards with my single ship, with both crews on board. I was several times under way, and ascertained that I had greatly the advantage in point of sailing, and once succeeded in closing within gun-shot of the Ph\u0153be, and com menced a fire on her. when she ran down for the Cherub, which was two miles and a half to leeward. This excited some surprise and expressions of indignation, as previous to my getting under way, she hove to off the port, hoisted her motto flag and fired a gun to windward. Commodore Hillyar seemed determined to avoid a contest with me on nearly equal terms, and from his extreme pru dence in keeping both his ships ever after constantly within hail of each other, there were no hopes of any advantages to my country from a longer stay in port. I therefore determined to put to sea 'he first opportunity which s-hould offer; and I was the more"], [313, "APPENDIX. 287 strongly induced to do so, as I had received certain intelligence that the Tagus, rated thirty -eight, and two other frigates, had sailed for that sea in pursuit of me ; and I had reason to expect the arrival of the Racoon trom the n. w. coast of America, where she had been sent for the purpose of destroying our fur establishment on the Columbia. A rendezvous was appointed for the Essex-Junior, and every arrangement made for sailing, and 1 intended to let them chase me off, to give the Essex-Junior an opportunity of escaping. On the 28th March, the day aster this determination was formed, the wind came on to blow fresh from the southward, when I parted my larboard cable, and dragged my starboard anchor directly out to sea. Not a moment was to be lost in getting sail on the ship. The enemy were close in with the point forming the west side of the bay ; but on opening them, I saw a prospect of passing to windward, when I took in my top-gallant sails, which were set over single-reeled top-sails, and braced up for this purpose ; but on rounding the point, a heavy squall struck the ship and carried away her main top-mast, precipitating the men who were aloft into the sea, who were drowned. Both ships now gave chase to me, and I endeavoured in my disabled state to regain the port ; but finding I could not recover the common anchorage, I ran close into a small bay about three quarters of a mile to leeward of the battery on the east side of the harbour, and let go my anchor within pistol shot of the shore, where I intended to repair my damages as soon as possible. The enemy continued to approach, and showed an evident inten tion of attacking, regardless of the neutrality of the place where I was anchored ; and the caution observed in their approach to the attack of the crippled Essex, was truly ridiculous, as was their display of their motto flags, and the number of jacks at their mast-heads. I, with as much expedition as circumstances would admit of, got my ship ready for action, and endeavoured to get a spring on my cable, but had not succeeded when the enemy, at fifty-four minutes after three p. m. made his attack, the Ph\u0153be placing herself under my stern, and the Cherub on my starboard bow ; but the Cherub soon finding her situation a hot one, bore up and ran under my stern also, where both ships kept up a hot raking sire. I had got three long 1 2 pounders out of the stern ports, which were worked with so much bravery and skill, that in half an hour we so disabled both as to compel them to haul off to repair damages. In the course of this firing, I had by the great exertions of Mr. Edward Barnewell, the acting sailing-master, assisted by Mr. Linscott, the boatswain, =ucceeded\u00b0 in getting springs on our cable three different times; but the fire of the enemy was so excessive, that before we could get our broadside to bear, they were shot away, and thus rendered useless to us. My -ship had received many injuries, and several"], [314, "288 APPENDIX. had been killed and wounded ; but my brave officers and men, not- withstanding the unfavourable circumstances under which we were brought to action, and the powerful force opposed to us, were no ways discouraged ; and all appeared determined to defend their ship to the last extremity, and to die in preference to a shameful sur- render. Our gaff, with the ensign, and the motto flag at the miz- zen, had been shot away, but \" free trade and sailors' rights\" con- tinued to fly at the fore. Our ensign was replaced by another ; and to guard against a similar event, an ensign was made fast in the mizzen rigging, and several jacks were hoisted in different parts of the ship. The enemy soon repaired his damages for a fresh attack : he novi placed himself with both his ships, on my starboard quarter, out of the reach of my carronades, and where my stern guns could not be brought to bear : he there kept up a most galling fire, which it was out of my power to return, when I saw no pros- pect of injuring him without getting under way and becoming the assailant. My topsail sheets and halliards were all shot away, as well as the jib and fore-topmast staysail halliards. The only rope not cut away was the flying-jib halliards ; and that being the only sail I could set, I caused it to be hoisted, my cable to be cut, and ran down on both ships, with an intention of laying the Ph\u0153be on board. The firing on both sides was now tremendous ; I had let fall my fore-topsail and foresail, but the want of tacks and sheets rendered them almost useless to us \u2014 yet we were enabled, for a short time, to close with the enemy ; and although our decks were now strewed with dead, and our cock-pit filled with wounded \u2014 although our ship had been several times on fire, and was rendered 3 perfect wreck, we were still encouraged to hope to save her, from the circumstance of the Cherub, from her crippled state, be ing compelled to haul off. She did not return to close action again, although she apparently had it in her power to do so, but kept up a distant firing with her long guns. The Ph\u0153be, from our disabled state, was enabled, however, by edging off, to choose the distance which best suited her long guns, and kept up a tremendous fire on us, which mowed down my brave companions by the dozen. Many of my guns had been rendered useless by the enemy's shot, and many of them had their whole crews destroyed. We manned them again from those which were disabled, and one gun in parti cular was three times manned \u2014 fifteen men were slain at it, in the course of the action ! But, strange as it may appear, the captain of it escaped with only a slight wound. Finding that the enemy had it in his power to choose his distance, I now gave up all hopes of closing with him, and, as the wind, for the moment, seemed to favour the design, I determined to endeavour to run her on shore, land my men, and destroy her. Every thing seemed to favour my wishes."], [315, "APPENDIX. 289 We had approached the shore within musket shot, and I had no doubt of succeeding, when, in an instant, the wind shifted from the land, (as is very common in this port in the latter part of the day,) and payed our head down on the Ph\u0153be, where we were again exposed to a dreadful raking fire. My ship was now totally un manageable ; yet as her head was toward the enemy, and he to leeward of me, I still hoped to be able to board him. At this mo ment lieutenant commandant Downes came on board to receive my orders, under the impression that I should soon be a prisoner. He eould be of no use to me in the then wretched state of the Essex \u2014 and finding (from the enemy's putting his helm up) that any attempt at boarding would not succeed, I directed him, after he had been about ten minutes on board, to return to his own ship, to -be pre pared for defending and destroying her in case of attack. He took with him several of my wounded, leaving three of his boat's crew on board to make room for them. The Cherub now had an oppor tunity of distinguishing herself, by keeping up a hot fire on him during his return. The slaughter on board my ship had now become horrible, the enemy continuing to rake us, and we unable to bring a gun to bear. I therefore directed a halser to be bent to the sheet anchor, and the anchor to be cut from the bows to bring her head round : this succeeded. We again got our broadside to bear, and as the enemy was much crippled and unable to hold his own, I have no doubt he would soon have drifted out of gun shot before he discovered we had anchored, had not the halser unfortunately parted. My ship had taken fire several times during the action, but alarmingly so forward and aft at this moment \u2014 flames were burst ing up each hatchway, and no hopes were entertained of saving her. Our distance from the shore did not exceed three quarters of a mile, and I hoped many of my brave crew would be able to save themselves, should the ship blow up, as I was informed the fire was near the magazine, and the explosion of a large quantity of powder below served to increase the horrors of our situation \u2014 our boats were destroyed by the enemy's shot ; I therefore directed those who could swim to jump overboard, and endeavour to gain the shore \u2014 some reached it \u2014 some were taken by the enemy, and some perished in the attempt ; but most preferred sharing with me the fate of the ship. We, who remained, now turned our attention wholly to extinguishing the flames ; and when we had succeeded, went again to our guns, where the firing was kept up for some minutes, but the crew had by this time become so weakened, that they all declared to me the impossi bility of making further resistance, and entreated me to surrender my ship to save the wounded, as all further attempt at opposition must prove ineffectual, almost every gun being disabled by the destruction of their crews. I now sent for the officers of divisions to consult them ; but what was my surprise to find only acting lieutenant Ste-"], [316, "290 APPENDIX. phen Decatur M'Knight remaining, (who confirmed the report re- specting the condition of the guns on the gun-deck \u2014 those on the spar-deck were not in a better state.) Lieutenant Wilmer, after fighting most gallantly throughout the action, had been knocked overboard by a splinter while getting the sheet anchor from the bows, and was drowned. Acting lieutenant John G. Cowell had lost a leg ; Mr. Edward Barnewell, acting sailing-master, had been car- ried below, after receiving two severe wounds, one in the breast and one in the face ; and acting lieutenant William H. Odenheimer had been knocked overboard from the quarter an instant before, and did not regain the ship until aster the surrender. 1 was informed that the cockpit, the steerage, the ward room, and the birth deck could contain no more wounded ; that the wounded were killed while the surgeons were dressing them ; and that unless something was speedi- ly done to prevent it, the ship would soon sink from the number of shot holes in her bottom. On sending for the carpenter, he informed me that all his crew had been killed or wounded, and that he had once been over the side to stop the leaks, when his slings had been shot away, and it was with difficulty he was saved from drowning. The enemy, from the smoothness of the water, and the impossibility of our reaching him with our carronades, and the little apprehensiori that was excited by our fire, which had now become much slacken- ed, was enabled to take aim at us as at a target : his shot never missed our hull, and my ship was cut up in a manner, which was, perhaps, never before witnessed \u2014 in fine, I saw no hopes of saving her, and at twenty minutes aster six p. m. gave the painful order to strike the colours. Seventy-five men, including officers, were all that remained of my whole crew, after the action, capable of doing duty, and many of them severely wounded, some of whom have since died. The enemy still continued his fire, and my brave, though unfortunate companions, were still falling about me. I direct- ed an opposite gun to be sired, to shew them we intended no farther resistance ; but they did not desist ; four men were killed at my side, and others at different parts of the ship. I now believed he intended to show us no quarter, and that it would be as well to die with my flag flying as struck, and was on the point of again hoisting it, when about ten minutes after hauling the colours down he ceased firing. I cannot speak in sufficiently high terms of the conduct of those engaged for such an unparalleled length of time (under such cir- cumstances) with me in the arduous and unequal contest. Let it suffice to say, that more bravery, skill, patriotism and zeal, were never displayed on any occasion. Every one seemed determined to die in defence of their much loved country's cause, and nothing but views of humanity could ever have reconciled them to the sur- render of the ship ; they remembered their wounded and helpless"], [317, "APPENDIX. 291 shipmates below. To acting lieutenants M'Knight and Odenheimer, I feel much indebted for their great exertions and bravery through out the action,.in lighting and encouraging the men at their divisions, for -the dexterous management of the long guns, and for their promptness in remanning their guns as their crews were slaughtered. The conduct of that brave and heroick officer, acting lieutenant John G. Cowell, who lost his leg in the latter part of the action, excited the admiration of every man in the ship, and after being wounded, would not consent to be taken below, until loss of blood ren dered him insensible. Mr. Edward Barnewell, acting sailing-master, whose activity and courage were equally conspicuous, returned on deck aster receiving his first wound, and remained after receiving his second, until fainting with loss of blood. Mr. Samuel B. John ston, who had joined me the day before, and acted as marine offi cer, conducted himself with great bravery, and exerted himself in assisting at the long guns ; the musketry after the first half hour being useless from our long distance. Mr. M. W. Bostwick, whom I had appointed acting purser of the Essex-Junior, and who was on board my ship, did the duties of akl in a manner which reflects on him the highest honour : and midshipmen Isaacs, Farrugut, and Ogden, as well as acting mid shipmen James Terry, James R. Lyman, and Samuel Duzenbury, and master's mate William Pierce, exerted themselves in the per formance of their respective duties, and gave an earnest of their value to the service ; the three first are too young to recommend for promotion ; the latter I beg leave to recommend for confirma tion, as well as the acting lieutenants and Messrs. Barnewell, John ston, and Bostwick. We have been unfortunate, but not disgraced \u2014 the defence of the Essex has not been less honourable to her officers and her crew, than the capture of an equal force ; and I now consider my situa tion less unpleasant, than that of commodore Hillyar, who, in viola tion of every principle of honour and generosity, and regardless ot the rights of nations, attacked the Essex in her crippled state, within pistol shot of a neutral shore, when for six weeks I had daily offered him fair and honourable combat, on terms greatly to his advantage. The blood of the slain must rest on his head ; and he has yet to reconcile his conduct to heaven, to his conscience, and to the world. The annexed extract of a letter from commodore Hillyar, which was written previous to his returning me my sword, will show his opinion of our conduct. My loss has been dreadfully severe, fifty-eight killed, or have -ince died of their wounds, and among them lieutenant Cowell ; thirty-nine were severely wounded ; twenty-seven slightly, and thirty-one are missing ; making in all one hundred and fifty-sour killed, wounds d. and rrtSsitlg, a list of whose names is annexed. 38"], [318, "292 APPENDIX. The professional knowledge of Dr. Richard Hoffman, acting surgeon, and Dr. Alexander Montgomery, acting surgeon's mate, added to their assiduity and the benevolent attentions and assistance of Mr. D. P. Adams, the chaplain, saved the lives of many of the wounded ; those gentlemen have been indefatigable in their atten tions to them ; the two first I beg leave to recommend for confirma tion, and the latter to the notice of the department. I must in justification of myself observe, that with our six twelve pounders only, we fought this action \u2014 our carronades being almost useless. The loss in killed and wounded has been great with the enemy -r among the former is the first lieutenant of the Ph\u0153be, and of the latter captain Tucker of the Cherub, whose wounds are severe. Both the Essex and Ph\u0153be were in a sinking state, and it was with difficulty they could be kept afloat until they anchored in Valparaiso next morning. The battered state of the Essex will, I believe, pre vent her ever reaching England, and I also think it will be out of their power to repair the damages of the Ph\u0153be, so as to enable her to double Cape Horn. All the masts and yards of the Ph\u0153be and Cherub are badly crippled, and their hulls much cut up ; the former had eighteen twelve pound shot through her, below her water line, some three feet under water. Nothing but the smoothness of the water saved both the Ph\u0153be and Essex. 1 hope, sir, that our conduct may prove satisfactory to our country, and that it will testify it by obtaining our speedy exchange, that we may again have it in our power to prove our zeal. Commodore Hillyar, I am informed, has thought proper to state to his government that the action lasted only forty-five minutes ; should he have done so, the motive may be easily discovered \u2014 but the thousand of disinterested witnesses who covered the surrounding hills, can testify that we fought his ships near two hours and a naif; upwards of fifty broadsides were fired by the enemy agreeably lo their own accounts, and upwards of seventy-five by ours ; except the few minutes they were repairing damages, the firing was inces sant. Soon after my capture I entered into an agreement with commo dore Hillyar to disarm my prize, the Essex-Junior, and proceed with the survivors of my officers and crew in her to the United States, taking with me all her officers and crew. He consented to grant her a passport to secure her from recapture. The ship was small, and we knew we had much to suffer, yet we hoped soon to reach our country in safety, that we might again have it in our power to serve it. This arrangement was attended with no addi tional expense, as she was abundantly supplied with provisions and stores for the voyage. In justice to commodore Hillyar, I must observe, that, although"], [319, "APPENDIX. 293 I can never be reconciled to the manner of his attack on the Essex, er to his conduct before the action, he has, since our capture, shown the greatest humanity to my wounded, whom he permitted me to land, on condition that the United States should bear their expenses, and has endeavoured as much as lay in his power to alleviate the distresses of war by the most generous and delicate deportment towards myself, my officers and crew ; he gave orders that the property of every person should be respected \u2014 his orders, however, were not so strictly attended to as might have been ex pected ; besides being deprived of books, charts^ &c. &c. both my self and officers lost many articles of our clothing, some to a con siderable amount. I should not have considered this last circum stance of sufficient importance to notice, did it not mark a striking difference between the navy of Great Britain and that of the United States, highly creditable to the latter. By the arrival of the Tagus, a few days after my capture, I was informed that besides the ships which had arrived in the Pacific in pursuit of me, and those still expected, others were sent to cruise for me in the China seas, off New Zealand, Timour, and New Hol land, and that another frigate was sent to the river La Plata. To possess the Essex, it has cost the British government near six millions of dollars ; and yet, Sir, her capture was owing entirely to accident ; and if we consider the expedition with which naval con tests are now decided, the action is a dishonour to them. Had they brought their ships boldly to action with a force so very superior, and having the choice of position, they should either have captured or destroyed us in one fourth the time they were about it. During the action, our consul general, Mr. Poinsett, called on the governour of Valparaiso, and requested that the batteries might protect the Essex. The request was refused, but he promised that if she should succeed in sighting her way to the common anchorage, he would send an officer to the British commander and request him to cease firing, but declined using force under any circumstances, and there is no doubt a perfect understanding existed between them. This conduct added to the assistance given to the British, and their friendly reception after the action, and the strong bias of the faction which governs Chili in favour of the English, as well as their hos tility to the Americans, induced Mr. Poinsett to leave that country. Under such circumstances, I did not conceive that it would be pro per for me to claim the restoration of my ship, confident that the claim would be made by my government to more effect. Finding some difficulty in the sale of my prizes, I had taken the Hector and Catharine to sea, and burnt them with their cargoes. I exchanged lieutenant M'Knight, Mr. Adams and Mr. Lyman, and eleven seamen, for part of the crew of the Sir Andrew Ham mond, and sailed from Valparaiso on the 27tb -April, where the"], [320, "294 APPENDIX. enemy were still patching up their ships to put them in a state for proceeding to Rio de Janeiro, previous to going to England. Annexed is a list of the remains of my crew to be exchanged, as also a copy of the correspondence between commodore Hiliyar and myself on that subject. I also send you a list of the prisoners I have taken during my cruise, amounting to three hundred and forty-three.\u2014 I have the honour to be, &c. D. PORTER. Hon. Secr'y of the Navy of the United States, Washington. Copy of a letter from Captain Porter to the Secretary of the Navy, dated New York, July 13, 1814. Sir, \u2014 There are some facts relating to our enemy, and although not connected with the action, serve to show his perfidy, and should be known. On commodore Hillyar's arrival at Valparaiso, he ran the Ph\u0153be close along side of the Essex, and inquired politely aster my health, observing, that his ship was cleared for action, and his men pre- pared for boarding. I observed, \" Sir, if you by any accident get on board of me, I assure you that great confusion will take place ; I am prepared to receive you, but shall only act on the defensive.\" He observed, coolly and indifferently, \" Oh, Sir, I have no such intention ;\" at this instant his ship took aback on my starboard bow, her yards nearly locking with those of the Essex. \u2014 I called all hands to board the enemy; and in an instant my crew were ready to spring on her decks. Commodore Hillyar exclaimed, with great agitation, \" I had no intention of getting on board of you ; \u2014 I had no intention of coming so near you ; I am sorry I came so near you.\" His ship fell off with her jib-boom over my decks ; her bows exposed to my broadside, her stern to the fire of the Essex-Junior, her crew in the greatest confusion, and in fifteen minutes, I could have taken or destroyed her. After he had brought his ship to anchor, commodore Hillyar and captain Tucker of the Cherub, visited me on shore ; when I asked him if he intended to respect the neutrality of the port ; \" Sir,\" said he, \" you have paid such respect to the neutrality of this port, that I feel myself bound\", in honour, to do the same.\" I have the honour to be, kc. DAVID PORTER. Copy of a letter from captain Warrington to the Secretary of the Navy, dated U. S. Sloop Peacock, at sea, lat. 27\" 47', long. 80\u00b0 9', April 29, 1814. I have the honour to inform you that we have this morning cap tured, after an action of forty -five minutes, his majesty's brig Eper vier, rating and mounting eighteen thirty-two pound carronades, with one hundred and twenty-eight men, of whom eight were killed and fifteen wounded (according lo the best information we could ob-"], [321, "APPENDIX. 295 tain :) among the latter is her first lieutenant, who has lost an arm, and received a severe splinter wound on the hip. Not a man in the Peacock was killed, and only two wounded; neither dangerously so. The fate of the Epervier would have been determined in much less time, but for the circumstance of our sore-yard being to- tally disabled by two round shot in the starboard quarter from her first broadside, which entirely deprived us of the use of our fore and fore-top sail, and compelled us to keep the ship large throughout the remainder of the action. This, with a few top-mast and top-gallant back-stays cut away, and a few shot through our sails, is the only injury the Peacock has sustained. Not a round shot touched her hull ; our masts and spars are as sound as ever. AVhen the enemy struck, he had five feet water in his hold, his main top-mast was over the side, his main boom shot away, his sore-mast cut nearly in two and tottering, his fore rigging and stays shot away, his bowsprit badly wounded, and fortyrfive shot holes in his hull, twenty of which were within a soot of his water line. By great exertion we got her in sailing order just as dark came on. In fifteen minutes after the enemy struck, the Peacock was ready for another action, in every respect but her fore-yard, which was sent down, fished, and had the fore-sail set again in forty-five minutes \u2014 such were the spirit and activity of our gallant crew. The Epervier had under convoy an English hermaphrodite brig, a Russian and a Spanish ship, all which hauled their wind and stood to the e. n. e. I had determined upon pursuing the former, but found that it would not answer to leave our prize, in her then crip pled state, and the more particularly so, as we found she had one hundred and twenty thousand dollars in specie, which we soon transferred to this sloop. Every officer, seaman, and marine did his duty, which is the highest compliment I can pay them. I am respectfully L. AYARRINGTON. P. S. From lieutenant Nicholson's report, who was counting up the Epervier's crew, there were 11 killed and 15 wounded. L. AY. Copy of a letter from captain Blakeley to the Secretary of the Navy, datect U. S. Sloop Wasp, L'Oricnt, July 8, 1814. Sir,\u2014 On Tuesday, the 28th ult. being then in latitude forty-eight degrees and thirty-six minutes n. and longitude eleven degrees and fifteen minutes w. we fell in with, engaged, and after an action of nineteen minutes, captured, his Britannick Majesty's sloop of war the Reindeer, William Manners, Esq. commander. Annexed are the minutes of our proceedings prior to, and during the continuance of the action. \u25a0 Where all did their duty, and each appeared anxious to excel, it is very difficult to discriminate. It te, however, only rendering"], [322, "296 APPENDIX. them their merited due, when it is declared of lieutenants fieilly and Bury, first and third of this vessel, and whose names will be Smong those of the conquerors of the Gurriere and Java ; and of Mr. Tillinghast, second lieutenant, who was greatly instrumental in the capture of the Boxer, that their conduct and courage on this occasion fulfilled the highest expectation and gratified every wish. Sailing master Carr is also entitled to great credit for the zeal and ability with which he discharged his various duties. The cool and patient conduct of every officer and man, while exposed to the fire of the shifting guns of the enemy, and without an opportunity of returning it, could only be equalled by the ani mation and ardour exhibited, when actually engaged, or by the promptitude and firmness with which every attempt of the enemy to board was met and successfully repelled. Such conduct may be seen, but cannot well be described. The Reindeer mounted sixteen twenty-sour pound carronades, two long six or nine pounders, and a shitting twelve pound carro nade, with a complement on board of one hundred and eighteen men. Her crew were said to be the pride of Plymouth. Our loss in men has been severe, owing in part to the proximity of the two vessels and the extreme smoothness of sea, but chiefly in repelling boarders. That of the enemy, however, was infinitely more so, as will be seen by the list of killed and wounded on both sides. Six round shot struck our hull, and many grape which did not penetrate far. The fore-mast received a twenty-four pound shot, which passed through its centre, and our rigging and sails were a good deal injured. The Reindeer was literally cut to pieces in a line with her ports ; her upper works, boats, and spare spars were one complete wreck. A breeze springing up next afternoon, her fore-mast went by the board. Having received all the prisoners on board, which from the num ber of wounded occupied much time, together with their baggage, the Reindeer was on the evening of the 29th set on fire, and in a few hours blew up. \u2014 I have the honour to be, &c.

At sour a. m. light breezes and cloudy ; at a quarter after four, discovered two sails, two points before the lee-beam, kept away in chase ; shortly after discovered one sail on the weather beam ; altered the course and hauled by in chase of the sail to windward ; at eight, sailed to windward, bore e. n. e. wind very light ; at ten, the stranger sail, bearing e. by n. hoisted an English ensign and pendant, raid displayed a signal at the main (blue and yellow"], [323, "APPENDIX. 297 diagonally.) Meridian, light airs and cloudy ; at half past twelve, the enemy showed a blue and white flag diagonally at the fore, and sired a gun ; fifteen minutes after one, called all hands to quarters and prepared for action ; twenty-two minutes after one, believing we could weather the enemy, tacked ship and stood for him ; fifty minutes aster one, the enemy tacked ship and stood from us ; fifty six minutes after one, hoisted our colours and fired a gun to wind ward, which was answered by the enemy with another to windward; twenty minutes after two, the enemy still standing from us, set the royals ; twenty-five minutes after two, set the flying-jib ; twenty nine minutes after two, set the upper stay -sails ; thirty-two minutes after two, the enemy having tacked for us, took in the stay-sails ; thirty-seven minutes after two, furled the royals : fifty-one minutes after two, seeing that the enemy would be able to weather us, tacked ship; three minutes aster three, the enemy hoisted his flying jib ; trailed up our mizzen ; fifteen minutes after three, the enemy on our weather quarter, distant about sixty yards, fired his shifting gun, a 12 pound carronade, at us, loaded with round and grape shot, from his top-gallant fore-castle ;_ seventeen minutes aster three, fired the same gun a second time ; nineteen minutes after three, fired it a third time ; twenty -one minutes after three, fired it a fourth time, twenty-four minutes after three, a fifth shot, all from the same gun. Finding the enemy did not get sufficiently on the beam to enable tis to bring our guns to bear, put the helm a-lee, and at twenty-six minutes after three, commenced the action with the after carronade on the starboard side, and fired in succession ; thirty-four minutes aster three, hauled up the main-sail ; forty minutes after three, the enemy having his bow in contact with our larboard quarter, endea voured to board us, but was repulsed in every attempt; at forty four minutes after three, orders were given to board in turn, which were promptly executed, when all resistance immediately ceased ; and at forty-five minutes after three, the enemy hauled down his flag.

Sir, \u2014 After a protracted and tedious stay at L'Orient, had at last the pleasure of leaving that place on Saturday, 27th of August. On the 30th, captured the British brig Lettice, Henry Cockbain master ; and on the 31st of August, the British brig Bon Accord, Adam Durno master. In the morning of the 1st of September, discovered a convoy often sail to leeward, in charge ofthe Armada 71, and a bomb ship ; stood for them and succeeded in cutting out the British brig Mary, John D. Allan master, laden with brass cannon, taken from the Spaniards, iron cannon and military stores from Gibraltar to England ; removed the prisoners, set her on fire, and endea voured to capture another ofthe convoy, but was chased off by the Armada. On the evening of the same day at half past six, while going free, discovered four vessels, nearly at the same time, two on the starboard, and two on the larboard bow, being the farthest to windward. At seven, the chase, a brig, commenced making signals, with (lags, which could not be distinguished, for want of light, and soon after made various ones, with lanterns, rockets, and guns. At"], [325, "299 APPENDIX. fwenty-nine minutes after nine, having the chase under our lee bow, the 12 pound carronade was directed to be fired into him, which he returned ; ran under his lee-bow to prevent his escaping, and commenced the action. At ten o'clock, believing the enemy to be silenced, orders were given to cease firing, when I hailed and asked if he had surrendered. No answer being given to this, and his fire having recommenced, it was again returned. At twelve minutes after ten, the enemy having suffered greatly, and having made no return to our last two broadsides, I hailed him the second time to know if he had surrendered, when he answered in the affirmative. The guns were then ordered to be secured, and the boat lowered to take possession. In the act of lowering the boat, a second brig was discovered a little distance astern, and standing for us. Sent the crew to their quarters, prepared every thing for another action, and awaited his coming up. At thirty-six minutes after ten, discovered two more sails astern, standing towards us. I bow felt myself compelled to forego the satisfaction of destroying the prize. Our braces having been cut away, we kept off the wind until others could be rove, and with the expectation of drawing the second brig from his companions ; but in this last we were disap pointed. The second brig continued to approach us until she came close to our stern, when she hauled by the wind, fired her broad side, which cut our rigging and sails considerably, and shot away a lower main cross tree, and retraced her steps to join her consorts ; when we were necessitated to abandon the prize. He appeared in every respect a total wreck. He continued for some time siring guns of distress, until probably delivered by the two last vessels who made their appearance. The second brig could have en gaged us if he thought proper, as he neared us fast ; but contented himself with firing a broadside, and immediately returned to his companions. It is with real satisfaction I have again the pleasure of bearing testimony to the merits of lieutenants Reilly, Tillinghast, Baury, and sailing-master Carr ; and to the good conduct of every officer and man on board the Wasp. Their divisions and departments were attended and supplied with the utmost regularity and abun dance, which, with the good order maintained, together with the vivacity and precision of their sire, reflects on them the greatest credit. Our loss is two killed, and one slightly wounded with a wad. The hull received four round shot, and the fore-mast many grape shot. Our rigging and sails suffered a great deal. Every damage has been repaired the day after, with the exception ot our sails. . . Of the vessel with whom we were engaged, nothing positive can be said with regard to her name or force. While hailing him pre vious to his being fired into, it was blowing fresh, fthen going ten 39"], [326, "300 APPENDIX. knots) and the name was not distinctly understood.* Of her force, the four shot which struck us are all 32 pounds in weight, being a pound and three quarters heavier than any belonging to this vessel. From this circumstance, the number of men in her tops, her general appearance and great length, she is believed to be one of the largest brigs in the British navy.\u2014 I have the honour to be, very respectful ly, your most obedient servant, J. BLAKELEY. Hon. W. Jones, &c. P. S. I am told the enemy, after his surrender, asked for assis tance, and said he was sinking\u2014 the probability of this is confirmed by his firing single guns for some time after his capture.

Being at anchor in the harbour of Plattsburg, in a line north and south, at the distance of about one hundred yards, the Eagle north, the Saratoga in the centre, and the Ticonderoga south, the enemy approached, in a line abreast, with a favourable wind, which ena bled him to choose his position ; his brig taking her station on the starboard bow of the Eagle, at the distance of about a mile, his ship about one point abaft her [the Eagle's] beam, and the sloop Linnet, of eleven guns, making an effort to obtain a raking position under our stern. Perceiving the object of the sloop, I ordered her a broadside, which compelled her immediately to strike her colours. At the moment when the enemy's ship had approached within point blank distance, the Eagle commenced upon her a most destructive fire of her whole broadside, excepting the two long 18's forward, which were occasionally discharged at the enemy's brig, who fre quently relieved her position and kept up a raking and most destruc tive fire upon this vessel. I was confident that it was of the highest importance, in order to insure success, to endeavour first to carry the enemy's ship. For a great length of time after the commencement of the action, the ship levelled her whole force upon the Eagle, dealing forth destruction. After having sustained the severest of the action for more than one hour \u2014 having my springs shot away \u2014 many of my starboard guns disabled, and not being in a situation to bring one of them to bear upon either the enemy's ship or brig, I ordered the cable cut and cast the brig, taking an advantageous position a little south of the Saratoga, bringing my larboard broadside to bear upon the ship, which was very soon compelled to haul down her colours. Our fire was now directed at the brig, which struck in the space of eight minutes, and our contest terminated in victory. We now turned our attention toward the galleys, some of which, it is believed, sunk, and the residue made their escape. The Eagle was in too shat tered a condition to pursue them. I have the honour to enclose the surgeon's report of the killed and wounded on board the Eagle, by which you will perceive there were thirteen killed and twenty-seven wounded, most of them se verely : also a copy of the report of the meritorious conduct of my officers and men, which I made to captain Macdonough, for your information, and which he has since informed me he had lost. I have the honour to be, sir, with high respect, your obedient senant, ROBERT HENLEY."], [328, "APPENDIX. 302 Copy of a letter from commodore Decatur, to the Secretary of the Navy, dated his Britannick majesty's ship Endymion, at sea, January 18, 1815. Sir,\u2014 The painful duty of detailing to you the particular causes which preceded and led to the capture of the late United States frigate President, by a squadron of his Britannick majesty's ships (as per margin) has devolved upon me. In my communication of the 14th, I made known to you my intention of proceeding to sea on that evening. Owing to some mistake of the pilot, the ship in going out grounded on the bar, where she continued to strike heavily for an hour and a half: although she had broken several of her rudder braces, and had received such other material injury as to render her return into port desirable, I was unable to do so from the strong westerly wind which was then blowing. It being now high water, it became necessary to force her over the bar before the tide fell ; in this we succeeded by ten o'clock, when we shaped our course along the shore of Long Island for fifty miles, and then steered s. e. by e. At five o'clock, three ships were discovered ahead : we im mediately hauled up the ship, and passed two miles to the northward of them. At day light we discovered four ships in chase, one on each quarter, and two astern, the leading ship of the enemy a razee. She commenced a fire upon us, but without effect. At meridian the wind became light and baffling ; we had increased our distance from the razee, but the next ship astern, which was also a large ship, had gained and continued to gain upon us con siderably ; we immediately occupied all hands to lighten ship, by starting water, cutting away the anchors, throwing overboard pro visions, cables, spare spars, boats, and every article that could be got at, keeping the sails wet from the royals down. At three, we had the wind quite light ; the enemy, who had now been joined by a brig, had a strong breeze, and were coming up with us rapidly. The Endymion (mounting fifty guns, 24 pounders on the mais deck) had now approached us within gun-shot, and had commenced a fire with her bow guns, which we returned from our stern. At five o'clock, she had obtained a position on our starboard quarter, within half point-blank shot, on which neither our stern nor quarter guns would bear ; we were now steering e. by n. the wind n. w. I remained with her in this position for half an hour, in the hope that she would close with us on our broadside, in which case I had prepared my crew to board ; but from his continuing to yaw his ship to maintain his position, it became evident that to close was not his intention. Every fire now cut some of our sails or rigging. To have continued our course under these circumstances, would have been placing it in his power to cripple us, without being subject to injury himself; and to have hauled up more to the northward to bring eur stern guns to bear, would have exposed us"], [329, "303 APPENDIX. to his raking fire. It was now dusk, when I determined to alter my course south, for the purpose of bringing the enemy abeam, and al though their ships astern were drawing up fast, I felt satisfied I should be enabled to throw him out of the combat before they could come up, and was not without hopes, if the night proved dark, (of which there was every appearance) that I might still be enabled to effect my escape. Our opponent kept off at the same instant we did, and our fire commenced at the same time. We continued engaged, steering south, with steering sails set, two hours and a half, when we completely succeeded in dismantling her. Previously to her drop ping entirely out of the action, there were intervals of minutes, when the ships were broadside and broadside, in which she did not fire a gun. At this period, (half past eight o'clock) although dark, the other ships of the squadron were in sight, and almost within gun shot. We were of course compelled to abandon her. In re suming our former course for the purpose of avoiding the squadron, we were compelled to present our stern to our antagonist \u2014 but such was his state, though we were thus exposed and within range ot his guns for half an hour, that he did not avail himself of this favourable opportunity of raking us. We continued this course until eleven o'clock, when two fresh ships of the enemy (the Po mone and Tenedos) had come up. The Pomone had opened her fire on the larboard bow, within musket shot ; the other about two cables' length astern, taking a raking position on our quarter ; and the rest (with the exception of the Endymion) within gun-shot. Thus situated, with about one-fifth of my crew killed and wounded, my ship crippled, and a more than four-sold force opposed to me, without a chance of escape lest, I deemed it my duty to surrender. It is with emotions of pride I bear testimony to the gallantry and steadiness of every officer and man I had the honour to command on this occasion ; and I feel satisfied that the fact of their having beaten a force equal to themselves, in the presence and almost under the guns of so vastly a superior force, when, too, it was almost self evident, that whatever their exertions might be, they must ulti mately be captured, will be taken as evidence of what they would have performed, had the force opposed to them been in any degree equal. It is with extreme pain I have to inform you that lieutenants Bab bit, Hamilton, and Howell, fell in the action. They have left no officers of superior merit behind them. If, sir, the issue of this affair had been fortunate, I should have felt it my duty to have recommended to your attention lieutenants Shubrick and Gallagher. They maintained throughout the day the reputation they had acquired in former actions. Lieutenant Twiggs, of the marines, displayed great zeal, his men were well supplied and their fire incomparable, so song as the ene my continued within musket range."], [330, "304 APPENDIX. Midshipman Randolph, who had charge of the lorecastle division managed it to my entire satisfaction. From Mr. Robinson, who was serving as a volunteer, I received essential aid, particularly after I was deprived of the services of the master, and the severe loss I had sustained in my officers on the quarter deck. Of our loss in killed and wounded, I am unable at present to give you a correct statement ; the attention of the surgeon being so entirely occupied with the wounded, that he was unable to make out a correct return when I left the President ; nor shall I be able to make it until our arrival in port, we having parted company with the squadron yesterday. The enclosed list, with the exception, I fear, of its being short of the number, will be found correct. For twenty-four hours after the action, it was nearly calm ; and the squadron were occupied in repairing the crippled ships. Suchofthe crew of the President as were not badly wounded, were put on board the different ships : myself and a part of my crew were put on board this ship. On the 17th we had a gale from the eastward, when this ship lost her bowsprit, fore and main-masts and mizzen top-mast, all of which were badly wounded, and was, in consequence of her disa bled condition, obliged to throw overboard all her upper deck guns. Her loss in killed and wounded must have been very great. I have not been able to ascertain the extent. Ten were buried after I came on board (thirty-six hours after the action) ; the badly wounded, such as are obliged to keep their cots, occupy the starboard side of the gun deck from the cabin bulk-head to the main-mast. From the crippled state of the President's spars, I feel satisfied she could not have saved her masts, and I feel serious apprehensions for the safety of our wounded left on board. It is due to captain Hope to state, that every attention has been paid by him to myself and officers who have been placed on board his ship, that delicacy and humanity could dictate. > I have the honour to be, with much respect, sir, your obedient .servant, STEPHEN DECATUR.

I have the honour to en close to you my parole, by which you will perceive the British ad mit the President was captured by the squadron. I should have deemed it unnecessary to have drawn your attention to this docu ment, had not the fact been stated differently in the Bermuda Ga zette, on our arrival there ; which statement, however, the editor was compelled to retract, through the interference of the governour and some of the British officers of the squadron. \" The great assiduity of doctor Trevett and surgeon's mates Dix and Wickes to the wounded, merits the highest approbation. The only officer badly wounded is midshipman Richard Dale, who lost a leg, a circumstance to be particularly regretted, as he is a young man possessed of every quality to make a distinguished officer. \u2014 I have the honour to be, &c. STEPHEN DECATUR.\" Copy of a letter from commodore Alexander Murray, president of a court of inquiry, held at New York, to investigate the causes of the capture of the United States frigate President, to the Secretary of the Navy, dated New York, April 17, 1815. \" Sir, \u2014 I herewith transmit to you the result of the court of in quiry, respecting the capture of the frigate President, with the opinion of the court. \" We have been more minute in our investigation than might, at first view, have been deemed necessary ; but as there has been a diversity of opinion prevailing among the British com manders, concerned in her capture, it was desirable in our view, to lay before the world, .in the most correct manner, every circumstance, that led to that event ; which has afforded another high proof of American heroism, and so highly honourable to he\u00b0r commander, officers and crew, that every American citizen must feel a pride in knowing that our flag has been so nobly defended. \" The minutes of the court having been read and approved, the court was cleared, and, after due deliberation, resolved to express the sentiments and opinions of the members, on the matters submit ted to them, as follows : ' ' \" In the execution of the orders of the honourable the secretary"], [332, "306 APPENDIX. os the navy, we have (with the exception os two very young mid shipmen) examined every officer belonging to the President, within the reach of the court, who survived the late glorious contest be tween the frigate President and a squadron of hisBritannick majesty. \" We are of opinion, that the primary cause of the loss of the President was her running on the bar, as she was leaving this port. The violence and the continuance of the shocks she received for an hour and a half or more, considering that she was laden with stores and provisions for a very long cruise, could not but have injured her greatly, and must have impeded her sailing. Her hogged and twisted appearance aster she arrived at Bermuda, must have been the effects of this unfortunate accident. We are convinced, that it was owing to this, that the enemy were able to overtake her. \" The striking of the President on the bar cannot be imputed to the fault of any officer who was attached to her. On the contrary, we think every possible precaution was taken, and the utmost ex ertions were used by her commander and officers, to insure her safe passage over the bar, and to relieve her after she had struck. The accident was occasioned by some mistake in placing the boats, which were to serve as beacons to the President, through a channel always dangerous for a vessel of her draught, but particularly so at such a time as she was obliged to select for passing it, when the land marks could not be distinguished. \" From the time that the superiority of the enemy's force was ascertained, and it became the duty of the President to evade it, we are convinced, that the most proper measures were pursued, and that she made every possible effort to escape. No means, in our opinion, were so likely to be attended with success, as those which were adopted by commodore Decatur. Any suggestions that dif ferent measures would have been more proper or more likely to accomplish the object, we think, are without foundation, and may be the result of ignorance or the dictates of a culpable ambition, or of envy. \" AVe consider the management of the President, from the time the chase commenced till her surrender, as the highest evidence of the experience, skill, and resources of her commander, and of the ability and seamanship of her officers and crew. We fear that we cannot express, in a manner that will do justice to our feelings, our admiration of the conduct of commodore Decatur, and his officers and crew, while engaged with the enemy, threatened with a force so superior, possessing advantages, which must have appeared to render all opposition unavailing, otherwise than might affect the honour of our navy, and the character of our seamen. They fought with a spirit, which no prospect of success could have heightened, and if victory had met its common reward, the Endymion's name would have been added to our list of naval conquests. In this"], [333, "APPENDIX. 307 unequal conflict the enemy gained a ship, but the victory was ours. When the President was obliged to leave the Endymion to avoid the other ships, which were fast coming up, the Endymion was sub dued ; and if her friends had not been at hand to rescue her, she was so entirely disabled, that she soon must have struck her flag. A proof of this is, that she made no attempt to pursue the President, or to annoy her by a single shot, while the President was within her reach, when, with the hope of escape from the over whelming force, which was nearly upon her, the President pre sented her stern to the Endymion's broadside. A farther proof that the Endymion was conquered is, the shattered condition in which she appeared, while the President, in the contest with her. had sustained but little injury ; and the fact, that, the Endymion did not join her squadron till many hours after the President had been sur rounded by the other four enemy ships, and had surrendered to them, is strong corroborative evidence of the disabled state in which the President left the Endymion. \" We think it due to commodore Decatur and his heroick officers and crew, to notice the proposition he made to board the Endymion, when he found she was coming up, and the manner in which this proposition was received by his gallant crew. \" Such a design, at such a time, could only be conceived by a soul without fear, and approved with enthusiastick cheering by men regardless of danger. Had not the enemy perceived the attempt, and availed himself of the power he had in the early part of the action to shun the approach of the President, the American stars might now be shining on the Endymion. In the subsequent part of the engagement, the enemy's squadron was too near to permit the execution of this design, and the disabled state of the Endymion would have frustrated the principal object which commodore Decatur had in making so bold an attempt, which was to avail himself of the Endymion's superior sailing to escape with his crew from his pursuers. \" We conclude by expressing our opinion, that commodore Deca tur, as well during the chase, as through his contest with the enemy, evinced great judgment and skill, perfect coolness, the most deter aained resolution and heroick courage \u2014 that his conduct, and the con duct of his officers and crew, are highly honourable to them, and to the American navy, and deserve the warmest gratitude of their country \u2014 that they did not give up their ship till she was surround ed and overpowered by a force so superior, that further resistance would have been unjustifiable, and a useless sacrifice of the lives of brave men. \" The order of the secretary of the navy requires us to express an opinion as to the conduct of the officers and crew of the Presi- 40"], [334, "308 APPENDIX. dent after the capture.

Sir, \u2014 In the course of official duty, it is my highest satisfac tion to render justice to the gallantry and good conduct of the brave officers and seamen of the United States navy. In giving an official sanction to the recent proceedings of the court of inquiry, instituted at your request, to investigate the cause of the loss by capture of the frigate President, late of the navy of the United States, while under your command ; and to inquire into the conduct of the commander, officers, and crew of said frigate, before and aster the surrender to the enemy ; it would be equally unjust to your merit, as well as to my sentiments and feelings, to pass over this investigation with a formal approbation. I have there fore, sir, to express to you, in the fullest manner, the high sense of approbation, which the President of the United States and this de partment entertain for your professional character as an officer, who, in every instance has added lustre to the stars of the union ; and whose brilliant actions have raised the national honour and fame, even in the moment of surrendering your ship to an enemy's squad ron of vastly superior force, over whose attack, singly, you were decidedly triumphant ; and you will be pleased to present to each of your gallant officers and crew, the thanks of your government, for their brave defence of the ship, and the flag of the United States The proceedings and opinions of the court of inquiry, of which commodore Alexander Murray is president, are approved.

Sir, \u2014 On the 20th of February last, the island of Madeira bear ing about w. s. w. distant sixty leagues, we fell in with his Britan nick Majesty's two ships of war, the Cyane and Levant, and brought them to action about six o'clock in the evening, both of which, after a spirited engagement of forty minutes, surrendered to the ship under my command. Considering the advantages derived by the enemy, from a divid ed and more active force, as also their superiority in the weight and"], [335, "APPENDIX. 309 number os guns, I deem the spee.dy and decisive result of this action the strongest assurance which can be given to the government, that all under my command did their duty, and gallantly supported the reputation of American seamen. Enclosed you will receive the minutes of the action,* and a. list of the killed and wounded on board this ship ; also enclosed you will receive for your information a statement of the actual force of the enemy, and the number killed and wounded on board their ships, as near as could be ascertained. \u2014 I have the honour to remain, very respectfully, sir, your most obedient servant, CHARLES STEWART. Copy of a letter from captian Biddle to commodore Decatur, dated United States sloop Hornet, oil Tristan d' Acuna, March 25, 1815. Sir, \u2014 I have the honour to inform you, that on the morning of the 23d inst, at half past ten, when about to anchor off the north end of the island of Tristan d' Acuna, a sail was seen to the southward and eastward, steering to the westward, the wind fresh froms. s. w. In a few minutes, she had passed on to the westward so far that we could not see her for the land. I immediately made sail for the westward, and shortly after getting in sight of her again perceived her to bear up before the wind. I hove to for him to come down to us. When she had approached near, I filled the main-top-sail, and continued to yaw the ship, while she continued to come down, wearing occasionally to prevent her passing under our stern. At forty minutes past one p. m. being within nearly musket shot dis tance, she hauled her wind on the starboard tack, hoisted English colours, and fired a gun We immediately luffed to, hoisted our ensign, and gave the enemy a broadside. The action being thus commenced, a quick and well directed fire was kept up from this ship, the enemy gradually drifting nearer to us, when at fifty-five minutes past one, he bore up apparently to run us on board. As soon as I perceived he would certainly fall on board, I called the boarders so as to be ready to repel any attempt to board us. At the instant every officer and man repaired to the quarter-deck, when the two vessels were coming in contact, and eagerly pressed me to permit them to board the enemy ; but this I would not permit, as it was evident from the commencement of the action, that our sire was greatly superior both in quickness and in effect. The enemy's bowsprit came in between our main and mizzen rigging, on our starboard side, affording him an opportunity to board us, if such was his design ; but no attempt was made. There was a conside rable swell on, and as the sea lifted us ahead, the enemy's bowsprit carried away our mizzen shrowds, stern davits, and spanker boom. * For the miaut^ os the action, &c. fee page 144--1 IS."], [336, "310 APPENDIX. and he hung upon our larboard quarter. At this moment an offic er, who was afterwards recognised to be Mr. M'Donald, the first lieu tenant and the then commanding officer, called out that they had surrendered. I directed the marines and musketry-men to cease firing, and while on the tafferel, asking if they had surrendered, I received a wound in the neck. The enemy just then got clear of us, and his foremast and bowsprit being both gone, and perceiving us wearing to give him a fresh broadside, he again called out, that he had surrendered. It was with difficulty I could restrain my crew from firing into him again, as he had certainly fired into us after having surrendered. From the firing of the first gun, to the last time the enemy cried out he had surrendered, was exactly twenty two minutes by the watch. She proved to be his Britannick Ma jesty's brig Penguin, mounting sixteen 32 pound carronades, two long 12s, a 12 pound carronade on the top-gallant fore-castle, with a swivel on the capstern in the tops. She had a spare port for ward, so as to fight both her long guns of a side. She sailed from England in September last. She was shorter upon deck than this ship by two feet, but she had a greater length of keel, greater breadth of beam, thicker sides, and higher bulwarks than this ship, and was in all respects a remarkably fine vessel of her class. The enemy acknowledged a complement of one hundred and thirty-two ; twelve of them supernumerary marines from the Medway 74, received on board in consequence of their being ordered to cruise for the American privateer Young Wasp. They acknowledge also a loss of fourteen killed and twenty-eight wound ed ; but Mr. Mayo, who was in charge of the prize, assures me, that the number of killed was certainly greater. Among the killed are captain Dickenson, who fell at the close of the action, and the boatswain ; among the wounded are the second lieutenant, purser, and two midshipmen. Each of the midshipmen lost a leg. AYe received on board, in all, one hundred and eighteen prisoners, four of whom have since died of their wounds. Having removed the prisoners, and taken on board such provisions and stores as would be useful to us, I scuttled the Penguin, this morning, before day light, and she went down. As she was completely riddled by our shot, her foremast and bowsprit both gone, and her mainmast so crippled as to be incapable of being secured, it seemed unadvisable, at this distance from home, to attempt sending her to the United States. This ship did not receive a single round shot in her hull, nor any material wound in her spars ; the rigging and sails were very much cut ; but having bent a new suit of sails, and knotted and secured our rigging, we are now completely ready in all respects, for any service. We were eight men short of a complement, and had nine upon the sick list the morning of the action. Enclosed is a list of killed and wounded. I lament to state, that"], [337, "311 APPENDIX. lieutenant Conner is wounded dangerously. I feel great solicitude on his account, as he is an officer of much promise, and his lpss would be a serious loss to the service. It is a most pleasing part of my duty to acquaint you, that the conduct of lieutenants Conner and Newton, Mr. Mayo, acting lieu tenant Brownlow of the marines, sailing master Rommey, and the other officers, seamen, and marines, I have the honour to command, was in the highest degree creditable to them, and calls for my warmest recommendation. I cannot indeed do justice to their merits. The satisfaction which was diffused throughout the ship, when it was ascertained, that the stranger was an enemy's sloop of war, and the alacrity with which every one repaired to his quar ters, fully assured me, that their conduct in action would be marked with coolness and intrepidity. \u2014 I have the honour to be your obe dient servant, J. BIDDLE. Loss on board the Hornet, one killed and eleven wounded. Copy of a letter from commodore John Cassin, to the Secretary of the Navy, dated Navy Yard, Gosport, June 21, 1813. Sir, \u2014 On Saturday, at eleven, p. m. captain Tarbell moved with the flotilla under his command, consisting of fifteen gun-boats, in two divisions, lieutenant John M. Gardner first division, and lieu tenant Robert Henley the second \u2014 manned from the frigate, and fifty musketeers ordered from Craney island by general Taylor. and proceeded down the river ; but adverse winds and squalls pre vented his approaching the enemy until Sunday morning at four, when the flotilla commenced a heavy galling fire on a frigate, at about three quarters of a mile distance, lying well up the roads \u2014 two other frigates lying in sight. At half past four, a breeze sprung up from e. n. e. which enabled the two frigates to get underway \u2014 one a razee or very heavy ship, and the other a frigate \u2014 and to come nearer into action. The boats, in consequence of their ap proach, hauled off, though keeping up a well directed fire on the razee and the other ship, which gave us several broadsides. The frigate first engaged, supposed to be the Junon, was certainly severely handled \u2014 had the calm continued one half hour, that fri gate must have fallen into our hands, or been destroyed. She must have slipped her mooring so as to drop nearer the razee, who had all sail set, coming up to her with the other frigate. The action continued one hour and a half with three ships. Shortly aster the action, the razee got along side of the ship, and had her upon a deep careen in a little tine, with a number of boats and stages round her. I am satisfied considerable damage was done to her, for she was silenced some time, until the razee opened her fire, when she com menced again. Our loss is very trifling.

No. 67 had her franklin shot away, and several of them had some of their sweeps and their stanchions shot away \u2014 but two men slightly injured from the sweeps. On the flood tide several ships of the line and frigates came into the roads, and we did expect an attack last night. There are now in the roads thirteen ships of the line and frigates, one brig and several tenders. I cannot say too much for the officers and crews on this occasion ; for every man appeared to go into action with so much cheerfulness, apparently to do their duty, resolved to conquer. I had a better opportunity of discovering their actions than any one else, being in my boat the whole of the action. \u2014 I have the honour to be, &c. JOHN CASSIN. Copy of a letter from midshipman M'Clintock to the Secretary of the Navy, dated Kinsale, Virginia, July 13, 1813. Sir, \u2014 I have to inform you of the unfortunate event which occur red here on the 14th ; the action between the British barges and the United States schooner Asp, commanded by Mr. Segourney. At nine, a.m. the Scorpion and Asp got under way from Yeocomico river and stood out. At ten, discovered a number of sail, which proved to be the enemy ; the Scorpion then made signal to act at discretion, and stood up the river; the schooner being a bad sailer, and the wind ahead, we were not able to get out. Finding the enemy approaching us, we thought it best to return. Immediately two of the brigs stood towards us, and anchored a short distance from the bar, where they manned their boats. Mr. Segourney thought it would be for our advantage to run further up the creek, which we did, but finding the enemy had left their vessels, we had not time to weigh anchor, there fore we were obliged to cut our cables. We were attacked by three boats, well manned and armed ; we continued a well directed fire on them, and after a short time they were compelled to retreat, and ob tain a reinforcement. About an hour after they retired, we were attacked by five boats ; we continued doing the same as before, but having so few men, we weie unable to repel the enemy. When they boarded us, they refused giving us any quarter. There were upwards of fifty men on our decks, which compelled us to leave the vessel, as the enemy had possession. They put her on fire and retreated. A short time after they lest her, we went on board, and with much dif ficulty extinguished the flames. \u2014 But it is with deep regret that I inform you of the death of Mr. Segourney, who fought most gallant ly in defence of the vessel ; and the utmost exertion was used by every man on board.

On yonder bright tablet, Columbia, behold, The names of your Greene and your Perry enrolled."], [344, "318 APPENDIX. VICTORY ON LAKE CHAMPLAIN. BY BENJAMIN WHITMAN, JUN. ESQ.. Oh wild is the land, where the yell and the cry Bid the traveller flee for the savage is near ; Where the Great Spirit moves in the clouds of the sky, Arrayed in the robes of his terror and fear. Oh wild is the land, where the forests and lakes And all things around are majestick and grand ; AVhere nature her palace triumphantly makes On the hills everlasting that rise from the land. There the wild men, while swiftly their game they pursue, Stop in their course, with enchantment are bound, And bless the Great Spirit, as gazing they view The waters, and earth, and heavens around. 'Tis the land of the west! where but lately were seen The wild tribes of Indians that wandered afar ; And where too was heard the wild yell and the scream, That roused in the savage the spirit of war. I sing now of war, of conquest and blood, Of warriours whose laurels now bloom o'er their grave ; \u2014 Of deeds done where once was the Indians' abode, I sing of Macdonough the brave. \u2014 The lowering clouds grew dark on high, And spread their curtains round the sky, And caught the flood of light Which poured from stars, which now above. The clouds that dark and silent move Break not the gloom of night."], [345, "319 APPENDIX. No thunders roar in this still scene, Along the heavens, no meteors gleam To light the darksome hour ; The forest, lake, and wave is hushed, And now the wind which by them rushed Suspends its mighty power. \u2014 Upon yon lake the billow's glow Sparkles around, no rushing prow, But all is smooth and calm ; And warriours too, who soon may die, Now slumbering on their hammocks lie, Nor dream approaching harm. The orb of day at morrow's dawn Will light the holy Sunday's morn, The sabbath of the Lord. The labour of the week is done, And all will at the rising sun Sing anthems to their God. But, now, o'er rock, vale, delve and steep, All Nature silent, seems to sleep Enveloped close in gloom ; And, save yon breeze that drives away The clouds before the face of day, Nature appears in dark array, An universal tomb. Morn now the orient gates have riven, And far and wide the purple heaven Foretells a bloody day. \u2014 Each cloud appears a bloody screen, Reflecting on each lower scene, Save where the mountains intervene The glorious morning ray."], [346, "320 APPENDIX. From yonder ship the signal gun Arouses with the rising sun The seamen from their slumber ; \u2014 Some shall with wreaths adorn their head. Some shall be counted with the dead, And proudly swell their number ! The cannon echoes far and wide Along the shore and mountain's side, And wakes the tuneful lark : \u2014 The wild birds raise their matin notes, And through the barges, ships and boats The slumbering seamen start. \u2014 What muttering sound is that which strikes the ear ?. What sails seem floating through yon misty air ? And with the breeze are now advancing fast \u2014 With flags far waving from each lofty mast ? See them, Macdonough cries, there streaming high, By heavens the Cross, the British pendants fly \u2014 They fly above your foe, who now prepare To taint this holy morn with deeds of war ! Display our Eagle, place our guns for fight, And they are ours, or else we die ere night. Now, o'er the lake the royal vessels sweep, And swiftly move along the misty deCp ; They come more near, and now abreast they lay, \" The wind of heaven too, gently dies away.\" Our men on valour place their strong reliance. And forthwith raise a shout of loud defiance. Then, as the sun's resplendent car Throws back the twilight clouds afar \u2014 And o'er the gloomy realms of air Scatters abroad his silent glare \u2014 So from each gallant vessel's side, Our dreadful port-holes gaping wide, Through fire and smoke The thunders broke"], [347, "APPENDIX. 321 And muttering spoke By every stroke Destruction to the foe ! 'Mid blood and fire each vessel rides, - And down their smoke-enveloped sides A torrent red of life-blood glides Into the lake below. Their shrouds, masts, yards, while falling crack, And every vessel seems a wreck, As death and ruin crowd each deck With trophies of their deeds. Ours ! work and fight as nothing fearing, They now another flag are rearing, And yonder vessel disappearing Their fire and valour feeds. One ship is sunk ! one flag is down, And adverse thunders rarely sound, Opposing seamen bleed around, And fall among their guns. Each ship a moving hearse goes on, Crowded with men whose souls are gone, Who now above the billows borne, No more are Albion's sons. The strife has ceased \u2014 Champlain no more- Is troubled with the cannon's roar, No thunders break from yonder shore \u2014 The victor is Macdonough : The clouds disperse, the sky serene Has not a cloud to intervene, And silence reigns through every scene-, The forest and the billow.
