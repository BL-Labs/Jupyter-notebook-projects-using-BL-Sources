It is to be understood that tbe Board is not responsible for the facts or opinions they contain. By order of the Board, K. BEOUGH SMYTH, Secretary. BALLAARAT MINING DISTRICT. No. 1 Division. (Robert Davidson, Mining Surveyor.) General Description of the Division.\u2014 The area of the divis:on is about 68_- square miles, and consists for the most part of good agricultural land. Its mineral resources are, as yet, but little known, except in the immediate vicinity of Ballaarat ; and in that neigh borhood there are many rich leads or gutters of gold being worked, the principal of which are the Golden Point, Nightingale, West Malakoff, Milkmaid's, and the Redan leads, which are to tho south of Sturt street, and Inkerman, Havelock, Al, and Dead Horse leads, north of Sturt-street. There are many small ributaries to those leads, which do not appear on the plan of the division (on the small scale), but on the plans on a larger scale they will be shown. Quartz-Reefs.\u2014 The quartz-reefs in this division do not seem to attract much notice, and therefore very little work has been done in this branch of mining in the division. I attribute the lack of energy in this particular branch to the fact that the miners seem to have greater confidence in deep sinking on the leads. In future reports I shall desciibethe various kinds o quartz that have been struck, and the quantity of gold per ton yielded by them respectively. There is no quartz-crushing machinery at work in the division. Machinery, &c. \u2014 The total number of steam-engines employed in working the leads above referred to is 39 and their aggregate horse-power is 643. The total number of puddling-machines at work is 43. Taking 324 cubic feet as the average capacity of a machine, and allowing one machineful to be puililled daily by each machine (which I believe may be taken as cor rect), the quantity of auriferous earth puddled would be 324 x 43 = 13,932 cubic feet = 61 cubic yards : allowing 6oz. of gold as the average yield of a machine, the quantity of gold obtained daily would be 258 oz., which, divided by 519 cubic yards, shows lOdwt. nearly to be the yield per cubic yard. The number of men engaged in raising the above quantity of auriferous earth is about 1,650. The daily yield of gold, 258 oz., at 78s. per oz., would produce \u00a31,006 4s., which, being divided by 1,650, the number of men employed, shows an average rate of wages of 12s. 2d. per day. As it is generally found that one-third of the time required io work a claim is spent in sinking the shaft, it is therefore clear that the remuneration to the miners on the deep leads is very small. I have not entered into these details as as an argument against the working of deep leads but only for the purpose of showing that such leads can only be profitably worked by large and well-organised companies. In a subsequent report Mr. Davidson says :\u2014 \" I may remark that the working of the leads is being carried on with much greater energy than the remu- neration received would seem to warrant \u2014 not that I consider there is any falling-off ia the yield of the leads, but from the facts that the difficulties to be overcome now in working those leads are increasing, and, from the principles upon which the companies are formed, there is a great deal of useless and misdirected labor employed.\" No. 3 Division. (Thomas Cowan, Mining Surveyor.) Since forwarding my last report, dated 13th May, a new auriferous reef has been struck in my district, which has been called St. Patrick's rush. The discovery was made in some shallow ground on the south side of the Morning Star Lead (No. 4 on plan), and contiguous to the Caledonian Lead. The discovery was made by Butler and party, who struck paying wash-dirt at a depth of about 36 feet. On the discovery being made public, I proceeded to measure off a claim of 150 x 150 feet, in accordance with the regulations of the district. After the discovery of paying wash-dirt in the pro- specting claim, a large number of persons took up claims upon the ground, and many shafts were sunk At one time not less than between 200 and 300 miners were on the ground, and claims were marked out in all directions. The run of auriferous ground has been found to go across the point of the hill, and seems to be a kind of wash upon the reef, the auriferous deposits being found in a stratum of gravel mixed with moderately- sized boulders of quartz. At the present time 25 or 30 claims are paying the average yield of wash-dirt, being about 3oz. to the load. The yield is of course found to vary in different claims, the highest of which I have heard being 3(Soz. from 10 loads of wash-dirt, and the lowest ldwt. to the tub. Towards the end of last month I have laid off a claim for the White Flat Company, a quartz prospect- ing claim of 1,800 x 1,200 feet. This claim has sincebeen abandoned in consequence of gold not being found in the various quartz veins crossed in the course of the sinking of the shaft. The following are the particulars of the works car ried on : \u2014 On laying bare the slate-reef, in carrying on the alluvial workings of the company, two quartz-lodes were discovered. These lodes were about 20 feet apart, and about 18 inches in width. The company, deeming it worth while to prospect these lodes, placed a shaft 35 feet to tbe west of the moat easterly lode."], [10, "4 MINING SURVEYORS' 'REPORTS. place the aforesaid bench-marks at the distance stated along each line. 4th. As the lead is worked, the surveyor should show upon a plan the course of the gutter in each claim, and also distinctly mark the name of the lead as it passes through each claim. 6th. The depth of the gutter, as found in the pros pecting claim, to be marked upon a plan, as well as the depth found in every succeeding claim. 6th. That copies of these plans should be sent in to the Mining Board, from time to time, to be kept there as records of the working of the lead. 7th. It is absolutely necessary that, when the parallels on a new lead are laid off, that a plan should be made, showing the datum-peg with the bench marks, the bearings of the lines of parallels, and the depth of the prospecting shaft from the surface to the deepest known point of the gutter. By the adoption of those rules, much of the uncer tainty which has so often characterised the workings of the various leads would be avoided, and evidence would be easily attainable as to the identity of the lead. One of the most desirable ends to be gained at the present time is to remove as far as possible the causes of complicated litigation between the companies on our deep leads, and to insure, as far as possible, the easy attainment of evidence relative to the identity and continuation of gutters. To some extent there must always be an element of uncertainty, but this may be reduced to its minimum amount by the adoption of a distinct, uniform method of survey. The above suggestions I submit as likely, at all events, to afford some information as to what is re quired to be done. Mining Leases.\u2014 With reference to mining leases, I would remark that many capitalists are deterred from entering into large operations by reason of the con ditions which are imposed by the lease as to the erec tion of machinery and the employment of labor. Few persons are inclined to risk the loss of large sums of money by erecting machinery or employing labor upon ground of which the auriferous qualities have not been tested. The first '20 suet sinking was through a grey sand stone-reef, in which water was found. This was fol lowed by agreenish-blue sandstone-reef, in which the shaft was carried down 77 feet further, when the body of water became so great that the company were un able to sink deeper without machinery. A drive was then opened, and carried in 30 feet. In the first 10 feet a small quartz-vein was crossed about 2 inches in thickness, and at the end of the drive another vein of about the same thickness was struck. The debris from these veins was carefully washed, but no gold was found, and the company, consequently, did not deem it advisable to pursue their operations for a longer time. Suggestions for Quartz-mining. \u2014 In carrying on mining operations, it is important to remember that on the amount of attention paid to details the success or failure of an operation frequently depends \u2014 in fact, no part of the working is unimportant or undeserving of careful consideration, as it is the small percentage gained by a saving of time or labor that suffices to render an operation profitable or otherwise. The mere placing of shafts in a wrong position has destroyed a paying operation, and caused a large sum of money to be uselessly expended, and I would therefore suggest to persons engaged in large operations to study economy in the details, and think nothing which in the least is conducive to a saving of time or labor unworthy of close attention. In working on a range, I should recommend that a shaft should be sunk from the crown of the hill rather than a tunnel driven in at the base. By sinking the shaft at the top of the hill, ample room will be obtained to run off the tailings, which are a source of great labor and expense if they have to be removed by manual labor. In many instances crushing-machines have been placed f.o near the base of the hill that the expense of removing the tailings has been found so great as to render the workings unremunerative. It is undoubtedly easier to raise quartz from a shaft than to convey it along a tunnel to the crushing machine ; and practical experience will show that the method which I have suggested will be both quicker and cheaper. It may be objected that by placing the machinery on the top of the range the getting of a sufficient supply of water would be very difficult ; hut I am of opinion that it would be ultimates- found to be a saving to drive a tunnel in the base of the hill, and sink a vertical shaft up which the water could be pumped. The arrangements of machinery will of course depend to a great extent upon the natural features of the locality where the operations are to be carried on, but it is essential that care should be taken to secure a good foundation for the stamping-bed, to insure which no amount of labor can be said to be thrown away. Duties of Mining Surveyors. \u2014 Much inconvenience, and no small amount of litigation have been occasioned in this district when disputes have arisen upon the boundaries of claims, by the want of a proper and uni form system of defining such boundaries. To obviate these evils in the future, I would respect fully suggest for your consideration \u2014 The consequence is, that much ground is now com pletely deserted, as no one likes to take the risk of applying for a lease when the lessee is compelled to spend a very large sum of money upon machinery which, it may liappen, he may never be able to employ. It may he objected, that persons wishing merely to prospect can do so under the prospecting regulations of the Mining Board of this district, by which a very liberal area is allowed. Under Sec. xxxiv. of By- Law No. 3 of the Ballaarat regulations, a party of miners can keep possession of about 360 acres of land, the only condition imposed being that the party shall keep regularly at work. On gold being struck, the party are compelled to make a declaration to that effect before the Warden, and the claim is reduced as provided in section 37 of the by-law already mentioned. These regulations, though undoubtedly very liberal, do not exactly meet the requirements of the capitalists. In the first place, they entail the necessity of having copartners in the claim, which is very often a very great drawback to the efficient carrying on of a large and complicated operation. 1st. That when a new lead is discovered, and declared by the Warden to be a lead to be worked under the \"frontage system,\" the surveyor in laying ossa line or lines of parallels, should properly fix the datum or starting point of the lead, by welldefined bench-marks. For this purpose a stump or tree, plainly marked with a broad arrow, would answer the purpose, and would be found by any surveyor other than the dis trict surveyor, who might be called in by miners in cases of dispute. 2nd. That at given distances, say every five chains, other bench-marks should be made which can be easily found, so as to avoid the necessity of measuring back to the datum peg. Such bench-marks should be con tinued al\"ng the whole course of the lead. 3rd. Should it be found necessary to lay off more than one line of parallels, the district surveyor should It may also be observed, that an opinion is prevalent that the title under the mining by-laws is not so good as that under a lease the local regulations not affording that fixity of tenure and freedom of action which are the primary essentials for successfully working. It may here be remarked that every restriction im posed, which is not absolutely required to prevent monopoly, is a drawback to the progress of mining industry, and only serves to injure the miner, whilst it professes to protect him. The restrictions im posed upon miners under the prospecting regulations are applicable to a different class of workings to those which would be carried on by capitalists investing in mining operations ; and for this reason are not suit-"], [11, "mining Purveyors' reports. 5 able to meet all the requirements of the gold-fields at the present time. Every day is showing more clearly the necessity for an increase of capital, a desideratum which can be only insured by allowing free scope for enterprise and ability. For these reasons I am disposed to think that the present leasing regulations might be to some extent modified with advantage to the capitalist, and without injury to the miner. I would suggest that leases should be issued con taining no conditions as to the employment of any given quantity of labor or machinery, such leases to he issued for such areas as may be deemed suitable. The lease might impose only a nominal rent until such time as the lessee or lessees shall have commenced washing out paying quantities of gold, or obtaining paying wash-dirt, when the employment of a certain quantity of machinery and labor might be required. I would suggest that such leases should only be ap plicable to grounu situated at least two miles from any gold-field, and all old ground upon any quartz reef, whether upon a known gold-field or not. I am aware that some difficulties might be found in carrying out this suggestion, but there is but little doubt they might be easily overcome. It is my firm opinion that a great benefit would be conferred upon this district by the adoption of this suggestion \u2014 that capitalists would be induced to take up large areas for prospecting purposes, on which large plants of machinery would be erected. The leases in question would Mso be us great benefit to the working miners, by whom much prospecting would he done, as they would probably find little difficulty in obtaining machinery when required, holding, as they would, a document giving them security of tenure. By these means prospecting in the cheapest and most effectual manner would be promoted, and probably a large extent of auriferous ground quickly opened. In conclusion, I may once more point out the dif- ficulty I meet with in obtaining the information re- quired of me, in consequence of unauthorised per- sons interfering in my district. The difficulty of keeping proper records is also greatly increased, as it is impossible to know what is being dune when claims are laid off by surveyors who have no responsibility to keep an account of the workings. This, as I have mentioned before, Ls particularly the case in respect to surveys required by the Chinese, and has the result of depriving me both of legitimate profit and necessary information. As I propose to give sections of shafts and other mining works, it is evident that an expense is entailed which will require all the work property within my district to compensate me for, besides the impossibility of getting the veiy facts which maybe necessary to render a plan or report complete. Thus, your honorable Board will see I am injured in two ways, and the completeness of my Reports seriously interfered with. I therefore trust that such steps will be taken as will enable me to receive the benefits from the district to which I have been appointed, aud of which I am expected to forward consecutive Reports to your honorable Board. With my next Report I shall forward you a glossary of mining terms usually employed in this district. be made by the companies now at work. Three pud dling machines have been erected and are now at work on the lead. The population is about 700. Staffordshire quartz-reef is very likely to yield satis factory returns. The quartz has been found within a few feet of the surface in some claims, and to a depth of 180 feet in others ; but as the two crushing-engines being put up on the ground are not yet in working order, nothing definite or reliable can be stated in re gard to the yield at the several depths. As soon, how ever, as tbe crushing begins, I shall ascertain the results, and report accordingly. Upwards of 20 are now occupied on the reef, and this number will ere long probably be doubled. Whimholes Lead is at present entirely abandoned by the original shareholders. The population has dwin dled down to about 300 or 400. The miners, however, for some time back, have had tolerably remunerative employment from some pretty good surfacing known as \" Taylor's Hill,\" about three-quarters of a mile in a north-westerly direction, and recently from some shallow ground lately discovered about a mile south ward, which is expected to form a regular gutter, and runs into the lead. The lead is pretty certain to be again taken up, and to yield satisfactorily if judiciously wrought. Frenchman's and Whitehorse Leads were originally proclaimed separate and distinct. About a year ago, they merged into one lead. Of the five companies now sinking for the \"after junction gutter,\" although, for the last three years they have labored most persever ingly, and have all within the last 12 months put up more powerful machinery, only one has reached a depth of 400 feet, which is about the supposed depth of the gutter. The other companies being more in ad vance of the source of the lead, will have to sink to a greater depth, and none of these are yet deeper than 250 feet, so that, taking the unrequited labor of the time past into account, it is not likely that these claims will ever pay. Black Lead is at present almost entirely worked in division No. 5 ; only one company is sinking on the portion thereof which is yet developed in any divi sion. Crawford Lead is not yet so far worked as to afford data for any reliable estimate of its probable yield, but appearances indicate that the party sinking on Go vernment ground are not far off the course of the lead. The only other company on the lead are in the private property of Mr. Winter. They paid him \u00a31,000 for permission to mine thereon. Just now they are \" swamped out,\" which means that they have encoun tered a quantity of water greater than they have means to contend with, and are waiting in expectation that, in time, the evil will rectify itself, as it has been often known that water, when suffered to accumulate in a shaft, abates of its own accord, having obtained vent at some lower level. Cobbler's Lead produces about an average yield to the only party who, up to the present, have got to the gutter. The Prince of Wales Company have just got through the fourth rock, at a depth of 295 feet. They expect to bottom on the gutter 8 or 10 feet lower down. The number of persons engaged in mining on this lead is 112. Overand above this number, however, there is what is called a mining population of persons trading and otherwise in connection with the miners, to the number of about 300. Paddy's Lead and Long Gully Lead are expected to form a junction with the \" Cobbler's.\" They have been traced as far as the boundary of my division, to the property of Mr. Winter, by which the further working of them has been prevented, being one of the many evils resulting to the miner from want us legislation on this perplexing subject. Alluvial Mining.'\u2014 Italian Gully, with tbe advent of the rainy season, is in a more prosperous state. Four surfacing claims have lately been taken up, in addition to eight already occupied along the guPy. It is the opinion of many miners th >t the surrounding country will ere long be well prospected, aud fuund to be as auriferous as the well-known neighborhood of No. 4 Division. (Michael O'Malley, Mining Surveyor.) Quartz Mining.\u2014 On the Black Ball Lead matters wear at present a more encouraging aspect, in conse quence of some very good prospects having been ob tained from one of the holes recently bottomed. Up wards of 40 claims are now registered on the lead, but only six or seven companies are actually sinking ; the others arc all \"shepherding,\" or waiting for informa tion as to the probable course of the lead through their claims, or parallels, from the discoveries soon to"], [12, "6 MINING SURVEYORS' 'REPORTS. In reference to the destruction of dams, I have ob served in this district that the general cause of their being carried away is that the by-wash is not left sufficiently large to carry off heavy floods, and that at the same time the top of the dam is not raised suffi ciently high, consequently the water, rising to the level of the dam, commences to cut a passage through it, which soon ends in its destruction ; and this chiefly occurs at the early floods of the year, when, after dry weather, the dams are out of repair. \" Smythe's Creek \" and \" Brown's,\" a few miles to the northward. Paddy's Gully, Moonlight Flat, and Spring Creek are in a state not entirely of abandonment, nor yet of occupation. A few straggling parties continue to work on the spots supposed to be payable. One general feature characterises these gullies and the surrounding country to an extent of 5 or 6 miles. It is described by miners as \" patchy \"\u2014that is, producing gold at frequent and numerous intervals ; sometimes in pay able quantities, but, so far as has been discovered, so sparsely distributed, as not to afford the miner steady remunerative employment\u2014 the only inducement which would cause a mining population to settle in the place. Some attention to these points on the part of the miners would, in most instances, prevent these disas ters occurring. The number of miners in the division is about 2,330, of whom about 300 are quartz-miners, and the re^ mainder alluvial miners. Creswick Division. (James Stevenson, Mining Surveyor.) From the table relating to machines given in Mr. Stevenson's report, it appears that there are 20 steam-engines at work, one idle, and two in course of erection. There are 48 whims at work, and eight idle ; and of water-races there are 24, six of which are not at present in use. Of puddling machines there are 140 at work, and 10 idle. During the month a considerable quantity of rain has fallen, filling the creeks and watercourses to over flowing, and thereby doing damage in several places to dams, reservoirs, &c, particularly to the large dam at Clunes, which, not being finished and prepared for such an early flood, was partially destroyed. In other respects the rain has been of much benefit, and sluicing from several of the water-races has been com menced. Gordon Division. The run of gold on Union Hill, going in a westerly direction, has not yielded as anticipated, and most of the claims in that direction are abandoned. On Sohier Hill, however, several claims have been taken up in the old ground, and are doing fairly, the wash ing-stuff averaging about half an ounce to the load. The machinery of tbe White Flat Prospecting Com pany at Clunes, owing to the mal-arrangementof the beat of the stamps, has been so much shaken as to cause a cessation of their works. It will take about three weeks to repair the damage done, the cost of which will be \u00a31,100. There is a large rush at Mount Glasgow, between Clunes and Back Creek, but it is just outside of ihis district, and therefore I shall not further allude to it. (J. B. Cusack, Mining Surveyor.) In a report, dated May 4, Mr. Cusack gives a table relating to quartz-reefs. He says : \u2014 \" The table shows *the number, depth, and other particulars of all the reefs and claims being worked in this division. The reefs not included in the table\u2014 viz., Moore's, Morgan's and Leviathan \u2014 have been abandoned some months ago, and are now included in the lease applied for by Mr. Potts.

I do not say that everv sluice-head is used eight times over,\u2014 the number depending on the level it is taken out at ; but I may safely assert that, on an average, each sluice-head is used at least three times. In former times, when sluicing first commenced in this district, the third right had but a very scanty supply ; now there arc more than 100 rights, and each right gets a supply, if not all the year, at least (unless in a very dry season) from seven to nine months therefrom. Such haye been the fruits of opening up Creek and Bank Springs. BEECHWORTH MINING DISTRICT. Spring Creek Division. (Henry Grimes, Mining Surveyor.) My report for the month of May is, I am happy to say, of a cheering nature. In consequence of the large fall of rain sluicing operations have been carried on with renewed vigor. As the greater part of the diggings in my district have already been once worked, sluicing is what we have mainly to depend upon ; and any operation which has for its object the increase of the supply of water, or rather for making most avail- able the supply that Nature gives, should be encou- raged ; adding as it must do, if successful, materially to the wealth of the country. During the severe rains that have lately fallen the diggers could not take the full advantage of the supply of water, and consequently the greatest portion has gone to waste. This will necessarily keep down the returns by the escort. Some of the diggers who have not sluicing claims are being gradually drawn oft to New Ballaarat, the Indigo, and Moore Creek, towards the Buckland. The Beechworth Prospecting Association are mak- ing vigorous efforts to prospect thoroughly Bowman's Forest, having bought a new engine of 12-horse power to work a shaft, which will be most likely 300 feet deep, and plentifully supplied **ith water. If our hopes and expectations in this forest are realised, a large field will be opened up, to the great benefit of the community generallj*-. I send enclosed a plan of a portion of the diggings on Spring Creek, facing Beechworth, which will be the commencement of a series I shall send down monthly. These digging were opened in 1852-3, and they will only pay now by slucing. From the Beechworth-Melbourne Bridge (A on plan) up the creek for a distance of 20 chains (to B on plan) the rock has been blasted to a depth of 2 to S feet by a party of 12 men calling themselves the Rocky Mountain Company, and at a cost of 3,000t*. they say. By lowering the bed of the creek in this manner it gives them a great advantage in draining the ground and in sluicing. The plan also shows several sluicing claims. There are others cut, but not running at present. Their positions are frequently changed, as well as their names. A very extensive operation is now in progress in this district, namely, that of bringing in the water from a number of springs, near a place called the Bald HiUs, for the purpose of sluice- washing on a large scale, old worked ground left by parties working with small streams. A company was projected for the same purpose some time ago, and a survey was made by Joseph Brady, Esq., C.E., but from some cause or other it died a natural death. John A. Wallace and a party of eight working men have, however, taken it in hand, and commenced the work. They propose making a slight difference in the levels, by lowering the race '20 feet, which, in my opinion, will be better, as giving them more water from the springs, and the height they lose will signify but very little. They have commenced the most arduous part of their undertaking first,\u2014 namely, that of making a tunnel nearly one mile long, and 105 feet below the turface at its deepest point. On boring to ascertain the nature of the rock, they passed through alternate layers of sandstone and slate to a depth of 100 feet, when they came to a stratum of yellow claj,butoi what thickness they did not ascertain. Having bored to 104 feet, and finding still the same clay, they did not bore any deeper. I will watch the progress of this tunnel carefully and report thereon monthly. Nothing has transpired during the month with regard to new ground. The population keeps about the same ;* if any change, a slight falling off in num bers may be mentioned. There are now two puddling-mills in operation, one having started operations during the month. Indigo Division. (Thomas E. Thorneley, Mining Surveyor.) The shaft that was being sunk in Pennyweight Flat to find a second bottom has been abandoned for want of funds, and on account of the water being so trou blesome, but they are determined to renew their efforts at a future period. Very little has been done upon the Indigo Main Lead this month. Thel ower part is very difficult to de fine, and the lead itself is now returning and running parallel to the old lead, as proved by three holes which will give a f ir return. There is a slight rise of ground between them. At present 1 cannot forward a tracing of it, as it has not yet been sufficiently proved. The upper part \u2014 the abandonea ground \u2014 is now being re worked by the Chinese. They are coming in very fast, and I should say we have about 1,000 here at the pre sent time. Snake Valley Division. (Thomas G. Kennan, Mining Surveyor.) The heavy rains which have fallen during the past month have caused mining operations in this district to assume a very prosperous appearance. The races have all a full supply, and sluicing operations are carried on with brisk activity. The value of water, and the distress arising from the want of it in this district, may be understood from the fact that, in some cases, a sluice-head of water is used no less than eight times from its source until it falls into the creek again. Each party usin^ it consists generally. .f four men, and, con sequently, it gives employment to 32 men, and in dry New Ballaarat.\u2014 The lower part \u2014 the wet and flooded ground\u2014 is now being retaken up, and a rush fyas occurred in consequence of the original prospect- ing party erecting an engine. Several other amalga mated claims are in treaty for engines. The upper portion of this lead has run out, and is partly aban- doned, with the exception of three or four claims, which only yield fair wages. A branch lead from tbe main Ballaarat, called Suf- folk Lead, has some very good payable ground in it. A rew lead has been found this last month at a depth of 205 feet with water. The wash-dirt is about two feet in thickness, and averages so far 2dwt. to the oil-can. It has not yet been fairly proved The drive is not dipping so that they have not rat into the gutter It is upon the Stockyard Creeks and is called the Clydesdale Lead.

The following table shows the machines at work, and idle : \u2014 and, with a few exceptions, the only men now work ing on that plan are Chinamen. A new reef has lately been discovered in the vicinity of Lockwood (Bullock Creek), about eight miles west of Sandhurst.

In most of the houses and tents I have visited I have found a certain degree of comfort, and every appearance of the owners having settled down to work in earnest. This, of course, may be expected among the proprietors of quartz reefs and valuable machinery, but even among the humbler class of miners an appearance of steadiness is to be observed. In so large a district as that of Sandhuist, it is impossible to arrive at anything like an estimate of the number of persons engaged in mining ; but I may remark that almost every owner of a quartz claim employs from three to four men, and where there is machinery, of course moie hands are re quired. The population is taken from the Police Returns, and consists of Europeans, 3,882 ; and Chinese, 1,000. Quartz-reefs.\u2014 1 am sorry to say that the reefs or leaders in this district are not so encouraging as before, for with the exception of two or tnree leaders which averaged from 2 to 5 oz. to the ton, in small quantities, the rest have not averaged more than from 1 to 1$ oz* to tlie ton- surlace-caps in all the leaders pay well, but after going down, say about 40 feet, the leader runs out, or will not pay expenses, and immediately afterwards the miner abandons it, in stead of sinking and putting in drives to catch the main reef, which has never yet been done in a single instance. I have no doubt but that, in time, when quartz-reefing is better known, good payable reefs will be found. On the subject of the number of puddling-mills in the district (including those at work and idle) I am better informed. They amount to rather more than 1,000. MARYBOROUGH MINING DISTRICT. Maryborough Division. (D. O'Leary, Mining Surveyor.) The Maryborough section of my division since my last report has received no small share of the dis appointed from Back Creek. The old deserted leads and gullies seem to have received a sprinkling of their old occupants ; and though mining operations gene rally near Maryborough are far from being lively, yet scores of diggers have for the past month taken up their winter quarters in their favorite haunts. In the Amherst section, in which is the Back Creek Gold field, small rushes occur almost daily, in consequence of the unsettled state and desire to search of the un successful miners. Of those rushes the Mount Glas gow is the most important, a detail of which more properly belongs to next month's report. SANDHURST MINING DISTRICT. Sandhurst Division. (G. W. Hart, Mining Surveyor.) The owners of quartz reefs are in general prosper ous, and new shafts are being sunk, and expensive machinery erected in various localities. On Tyson's Reef, the most easterly of them, about \u00a36,000 have lately been expended in the putting up a steam-engine for the double purpose of pumping the water from the mine, and of quartz-crushing. On the Victoria similar machinery is being erected at present on a very extended scale. Other companies are about to follow the example, among which I may mention the firm of Carter, Vandamme, and Co., on the Anglo Reef. Very rich quartz has been found in the mine of the Albion Company, on the Paddy's Gully Reef ; and from the appearance of the vein, it bids fair to rivaf the richness of the claim adjoining it. I was mysell down their shaft on the same day they struck gold at a depth of 148 feet. The part of the i eef struck is that which the miners term the \" cap,\" that is, the upper edge. The dip of this reef is nearly 90 degrees with the horizon. In the Epsom and Huntly district a few crushing machines are solely employed in crushing the auri ferous quartz conglomerate (cement) and quartz gravel, so generally found in that locality ; and if the erection of more powerful engines is any pro--f of pro sperity, the crushing of this material must be re munerative. In the alluvial workings, puddling appears to be by far the most extensively followed, some of the miners owning three or four puddling-mills, and consequently giving employment to many men, and keeping suffi cient horses to work them. The wages of an able bodied laborer, in the employment of a puddler, are about \u00a34 per week. The tub and cradle mode of working is nearly abandoned, as the gold-workings in general are too much exhausted for individual labor, Back Creek, though still supporting a respectable population, is certainlj on the decline. The recent heavy rains, however much desired, have done con siderable mischief in the centre of the lead, by over flooding many of the claims, which had been nearly worked out. At both ends of the lead, in the hard sinking wings, the miners yet retain possession of their claims, but are exceedingly dilatory in prose cuting the work. The population, however, is of a settled character. The miners here should feel much indebted to a Mr. Moleeky, of M'Callum's Creek, for his laudable exer tions in the reduction of the charge for quartz-crush ing in this district\u2014 a boon much needed by those who have been engaged at moderately-paying quartz. This enterprising German has this month completed the erection of a powerful quartz-crushing machine, with which he will crush quartz for \u00a31 per ton. Had the price for crushing been as reascnable as this for the last 12 months, many of the quartz claims in this district, which have been either abandoned or locked up by registration, would have been worked. The miners on discovering a new reef, and after crushing their prospecting quartz, finding that the net proceeds will not cover expenses, generally abandon a pursuit which, if circumstances had permitted, might have proved most lucrative by perseverance. Hitherto the charge for crushing quartz in this district has been \u00a32 per ton."], [16, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 10 from what 1 could ascertain, was not more than 2oz. to the load. Those separate workings, the Amphi theatre, Mountain Hut, and Rutherford's Creek, I conceive to be only tributaries of one main lead, con verging at or near the Avoca township. You may observe by referring to my plan where these several water-courses accompanying such workings all fall into our main creek. Why these places do not com mand more attention is, that whilst the miners can always obtain a good livelihood, the diggings are yet so dissimilar to the more favored workings at Back Creek and other places, inasmuch as there are no rich claims to chronicle, that the yield of gold ob tained only holds out inducements to those miners who, in the common language of the diggers, term such workings \"tucker ground.\" It is held in ridi cule by a vast number, yet, I think, were the places more generally known in this particular part of the district, a certain remuneration might safely be calcu lated upon.

This arises from the fact, that the sites for quartz-crushing machines are more eligible at M'Callum's Creek, Amherst, where a good supply of water can be had throughout the year. With respect to the quartz-reefs in this district, per haps it would be well, in order to ascertain their rela tivepositions,toconnectthem with some given place as a starting-point. Let that starting-point be the inter section of High and Inkerman streets (marked P on the plan), and their order in proximity to this point is, first. Mariners' Reef, S. 9 deg. E., 9,453 links to the shaft of King, Harding, and Co. This reef is de cidedly the most important in the district, though the prospecting claim (marked X 10 on the plan) is the only one being worked at present. I believe I touched, in a former report, on certain conditions en tered into by the shareholders of 1, 2, 3, and 4, 5, 6, 7, and the intended Maryborough Quartz-crushing and Sluicing Company. Pending those conditions, the claims have been locked up. They have been already worked to the following depths : \u2014 Quartz-reef No. 1 (shown on the plan about half a mile east of Avoca), which, for some two years or more, has been quite abandoned, has a short time since been again taken possession of by some of the original shareholders. The reef, in many places, had been sunk previously to a depth of 150 feet, at which depth water was strucK, and no gold having then been discovered, it was abandoned. The present party, I am informed, have struck gold at a much higher level. I apprehend the other portion of the reef will also be fairly tested. I have not visited these workings, but I shall do so, and give more detailed information in my next Re port. Dunolly Division. (R. J. M'Millan, Mining Surveyor.) During this month a considerable increase has taken place in the population of the division. The copious supply of rain which we have had has filled all the dams and water-holes, and has induced many to return from Back Creek. All the puddling-machines and crushing-mills are in full work, and employing their full complement oflabor. Several new reefs have been opened, with moderate prospects, but time is required to test them, for it is frequently the case that a reef affording very rich stone near the surface turns out far from payable afier going down a little way, and often runs out altogether or cannot be traced.

(John Catto, Mining Surveyor.) Avoca Division. (R. English, Mining Surveyor.) Fenton's Diggings.\u2014 Fenton's Diggings are still in the same dull state as last month, and contain only a population of about 40 miners, who are confining their operations to the old workings and their vicinity, with very indifferent results. Synott's Diggings.\u2014 The population of this place is now reduced to about 50 miners, including 11 Chinese. They are all employed in the partially -worked ground previously discovered. They maybe said to be obtain ing a living, or poor remuneration for their labor, and, from present appearances, I think there is but little chance of any new ground being discovered for some time. M'lntyre's Diggings.\u2014 These diggings are stUl in a languid state, and the population very small.

State of the District, &c. \u2014 Since my report last month we have been abundantly supplied with water, causing the miners to resume vigorously their wash ing operations, especially those engaged with puddling machines ; consequently our escort returns from Avoca will be considerably increased for some time to come. Notwithstanding the late rains, I cannot note any ad dition to ourmining population, excepting at the Am phitheatre, the rush to which (mentioned in my last report as likely to attract further notice) is steadily progressing, the population now being about 1,200 Europeans (daily increasing), and 1,000 Chinese. The yield of gold on the average is about 2oz. to the load. At the Mountain Hut, I have no change what ever to communicate. A small rush has taken place on Ruthei-ford's Creek about two and a half miles distant from the Avoca township, the number of Europeans being about 600, and the yield of gold."], [17, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 11 lained such rich quartz at first, have been unable to trace the reef or vein except lor a short distance. Jericho Diggings.\u2014 Operations here are cMefly con fined to quartz-reefing, and that branch of mining is considerably duller since my last report, owing in many instances to the impoverished state of those en gaged in the search of reefs. The discovery of one payable claim causes many to continue sinking, who have not the means to continue when unfortunate in finding the reef according to their first ideas ; and the absence of crushing-machinery on the ground has also causfid some to suspend their operations for a time. A steam quartz-crushing machine is now almost com pleted, which will enable the miners to try their claims as they proceed with more certainty as to the result. The quartz workings here are chiefly confined to leaders, or veins ; and until the main reefs are found payable, the permanency of the place is very doubtful, unless those veins already discovered be come more remunerative than heretofore. Another auriferous deposit has been discovered at the extreme south-western portion of the Castle maine division, aud about three miles from the town ship of Newstead. The prospecting shaft was sunk on Mackenzie's private property, near the banks of the Loddon River, at the foot of a range of trap-forma tion. The sinking is from 30 to 40 feet, through de composed rock and fragmentary trap and limestone. (I think the limetone is a deposit from the Limestone Creek, which flows into the Loddon above the dig gings.) At 15 feet is a layer of conglomerate, the under strata gravelly, quartz-nodules, and debris, and the wash-dirt is gravelly, from 10 to 18 inches deep, and resting on alternating layers of blueish pipeclay and slate. The prospectors uugeretted 200oz. last week ; a second party divided 36oz. per man; and two other shafts bottomed on a prospect of loz. to the tin dish of wash dirt. Other parties are prospecting down the Loddon, and within the township of Newstead, with equally good results ; and it is confidently believed that the extensive Loddon flat will prove one vast gold-field, the trappean formation and general character of the country fully warranting such an assumption. From the number of creeks falling into the Loddon near this point, some of the pockets will be found ex ceedingly rich, but the working will be impeded by water, and in consequence of the land having been alienated. Mackenzie, Turvey, and others, charge the extortionate sum of \u00a35 per month for tbe occupation of a claim 20 x 40 feet, equal to \u00a3270 per acre per month. The same remarks apply to the adjoining reefs of Jordan's Diggings, there being only two claims from which payable quartz is being obtained (average loz. per ton). Kingower Gold-field. \u2014 Kingower Gold-field only contains a population of about 500, and is remarkably dull, considering the favorable season of the year for mining operations. Tnere have been a few smajl patches of auriferous surface discovered during the month, adjoining the old workings, from which several nuggets have been obtained, varying in weight from loz. to 12oz. The \" Union\" Reef, so long worked with poor results, is now likely to repay the share holders who have persevered long, and expended con siderable capital. I shall endeavor to send you a plan, or Bection of the underground workings, with a state ment of the yield of gold at various depths, &c. Korong Diggings.\u2014 This gold-field is at present the most attractive in the district for alluvial mines. The population has been increased during the month by about 350, including about 160 Chinamen. The late rains have been beneficial for the miners, and many have been washing-up since. There are about 38 puddling-mills at work on this field. The prospectore for a quartz-reef at the scrub rush have not yet found anything payable, but are still persevering with the search. Nothing new in quartz mining has taken place during the month, but those reefs previously worked and abandoned are now likely to be worked with success. A piece of new alluvial ground opened during the month, adjoining the old flat, is the prin cipal spot of attraction for the miners. The district on the whole is very dull, notwith standing the abundance of water throughout, which should give a good opportunity for prospectors; but the majority of these having funds to expend on pros pecting, left the district for \" Back Creek, \"previous to the supply of rain which came so opportunely. Wattle Gully, Forest Creek, which is situated near the Monk, one of the district landmarks, is one of the richest localities in the colony for auriferous quartz. It maybe properly termed a \"bed of gold mines.\" Auriferous quartz may be found in the g\u00ablly and adjacent ranges for a width of 1,?00 feet. The depth of sinking in the main alluvial workings is from 25 to 30 sett, through decomposed rock and fragmentary quartz, sandstone, and shale. The drifts contained yold for a depth of 6 feet, and were exceed ingly rich, lying on blue slate bedding rock. Now, after six years' working, it is yielding a living to many families. This gully, like many sections of this division, supplies incontrovertible proofs that alluvial gold in the flats and gullies is de rived from, and is the result of disintegration of quartz ; the gold having been liberated therefrom, and deposited by natural causes. The principal run of gold in this gully is traced from the outcrop of reef\" No. 1, claim 1, and each of the branch gullies were supplied from the outcrop of a quartz-dyke. Several are shown on the plan, besides which the Deadman's Gully is worked up to Monk's Hill Reef, the branches of Golden Gully to the Old Post Office and Hardhill Reefs. Where a gully continues above such outcrop of quartz, little, if any, gold is found, and neighboring gullies running parallel and precisely similar in geo logical formation, but not having quartz-reefs, are also non-auriferous. CASTLEMAINE MINING DISTRICT. Castlemaine Division. (Thomas Lawrence Brown, Mining Surveyor.) Quartz-Mining. \u2014 Quartz-mining commenced on the outcrop of claim 1, reef 1, which was from 3 to 4 feet wide, and with tbe imperfect disintegration of that time, yielded 12oz. per ton. This was supposed to bea reef, but was found at the depth of a few feet to run into leaders underlying each other at irregular dis tances, and, at the greatest depth yet attained the leaders are found to runout and come in, as they were found near the surface. These leaders crop out in the north, dip to the south, and underlie westerly at every degree of angle. Exceedingly rich patches have been extracted from these workings. The vein, show ing on the surface in claim No. 1 was struck in No. 2, at 30 feet deep extraordinarily rich, two tons yielding 402 oz. ; a second two tons, 533 oz. ; and from half a bucket of specimens 286 oz. were obtained. Claim No. 3 struck the same vein at 80 feet, but it soon run out, and other veins came in. The last crushing from the deepest shaft (claim 6) below the water-level yielded 45 oz. per ton, the gold generally coarse \u2014 ounce nug gets, and even five ounce pieces being found, yet much A plentiful supply of water has increased mining operations. Nearly all the machinery is being worked, and among the European population prospects are more promising. The Chinese are very unsettled, and devoting more attention to politics than mining, using their utmost endeavor to evade payment of the residence-tax. During the past month 14 sites have been granted for puddling-machines and 16 puddiers' claims, total 13a. 3r. 22p. ; and one horse-pump for sluicing, and seven horse-pumps for drainage. Eight puddling machines have been abandoned, leaving our present mechanical appliance- as follows, viz. : \u2014 32 steam-engines. 33 quartzcrushing-machines. 434 puddling-machines. 16 horse-whims. 19 horse -pumps. 32 sluices."], [18, "12 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. There have been several alluvial rushes during tho past month, but not sufficiently important to render a detailed statement of any interest. Two of these were in the neighborhood of Nuggety Creek, a part of this division remarkable for the large lumps of gold which have been discovered on various occasions, although not of recent date. of the quartz is so poor as scarcely to pay for working. Workings No. 2.\u2014 Phillips' Reef was discovered under the alluvia] workings, and is believed to be a reef. Its magnetic bearing is 1 degree 25 minutes east of north. It has no perceptible dip, and its under lie is 1 in 3 to the west. Claims 1 to 6 have worked to the water level, obtaining from 9 to 12 oz. per ton ; and claims from 7 to 11 inclusive have not yet reached the reef. Nuggety Creek is situated in a S.E. direction from Fryer's Town, and many parts have high and precipi tous ranges on either side, with huge rocks projecting from the surface. Whether the peculiar formation of these hills is at all indicative of the character of the gold which we might expect to find imbedded between the rocks in the creek, is a matter for consideration. Should such be the case, there are numerous gullies diverging from the main one which have been very little prospected ; and that U somewhat surprising, inasmuch as external indications exist confirming tho hypothesis of auriferous deposits in the beds of such gullies. Yet these indications are not observed, rela tively speaking, and, even when observed, the old ground possesses greater attractions. Another rush in the neighborhood of Church's Flat, upon a surface hill, has afforded occupation to a con siderable number of miners\u2014 some 200 Chinamen and a few Europeans. In this instance, a foot of dirt from the surface is washed, comprising 3 inches of black loamy soil, and 9 inches of drift, gravel, and stones, including occasionally large boulders. Pieces of gold, varying in size from \u00a3oz. to 2oz., have been discovered, and not unfrequently. The majority are well satisfied with the returns. Sluicing.\u2014 This branch of mining, or rather system of working the beds and banks of rivers, has decidedly progressed, and there is every probability of still greater progress. Sluicing operations are confined principally to the Loddon River \u2014 the nearest part distant about two miles from Fryer's Town. At the present time the workings extend from near Guildford to a point four or five miles beyond the junction of Middleton Creek. Following the various windings, this would comprise a large area of ground. Comparatively a very small portion of this space is occupied by the miners ; those, however, who have been engaged any consider able time have generally been successful, one party, who have an extended claim in the bed of the river, have realised during tbe past three year's sufficient to make their average equivalent to 25s. per day per man, ex clusive of all incidental expenses. They work the ground with the assistance of a water-wheel, 6 feet in diameter, which, with a fall of water equal to 69 square inches, is equivalent to one-horse power. This wheel serves two purpose.\". Firstly, it enables the party to keep their excavations moderately dry by pumping ; and, secondly, it can be so applied as to work a small puddling-machine, thus greatly econo mising labor. They wash the whole of the earth in their claim, and gold appears equally distributed throughout \u2014 that is, in the earth from the surface to the bed rock, in depth from 0 to 10 feet. These co-operative companies are increasing, and although instances of extraordinary success are very rare, still a degree of certainty with respect to mode rate returns induces the otherwise unfortunate to combine their capital, and apply for grants of the old abandoned ground. The Mining Board rules are peculiarly applicable and liberal in this respect ; and although some of them are vague and somewhat ver bose, they generally work well and are adanted to the requirements of the digge*r. No. 3. \u2014 Shank's Reef is a continuation of Specimen Reef (El dorado), in Fryer's Division ; its bearing is 12 degrees 30 minutes west of magnetic north, and it passes under private property. Its line of declination is just the opposite to other workings in tha gully. From its outcrop at claim 1 it is dipping north, and underlying 1 in 2 easterly ; so that the miners hi sinking their shafts magnetic north in claim 2 cut the reef at 38 feet ; at 3a at 60 feet ; and at 3b at 95 feet. (These numbers refer to the plan.) The other parties having sunk in the line to avoid private property will have to go deeper in proportion before striking the reef. Clain No. 2 has just struck a second vein, in which the precious metal shows very promisingly at 84 feet. No. 4.\u2014 The Upper Wattle Gully Reef is similar in formation to No. 1 ; it has been prospected a length of 1,400 feet. From 8 to 10 dwt. of gold per ton of quartz was obtained, but it was abandoned for more (laying workings. No. 5.\u2014 The Red Hill portion has vielded excellent prospects. It was lately held by the Chewton Com pany, and now by Thorburn and Co. Neither of the other shafts have as yet proved payable. No. 6.\u2014 The Mona Reef, bearing 15 degrees west of north, has an immense outcrop or overflow of white quartz, almost devoid of foreign substance. Shafts have been sunk along the reef, and at a depth of \u2014 2\u00a3oz. per ton were obtained, but the general yield was so low that the whole is now abandoned. In reference to the hypothesis of parallelism and meridian lines, it requires the reefs to be followed throughout the district, i. e., all reefs in the Castle maine division run into Fryer's Creek ; therefore com plete plans of the two divisions should show continua lions of the same dikes. Referring to the plan, we may assume Nos. 4 and 6 to be continuations of the same reef; No la, and No. 1 to be the same ; and the four out-croppings of No. 5 may be one reef. Fryer's Creek Division.

The report which I have to make of mining pro gress in this division, since my last, is rather favor able, and chiefly with respect to alluvial operations, undoubtedly attributable to the late heavy rains with which we have heeu favored. The puddlers are those principally benefited, as in the absence of an abundant supply of water this section of the digging community is prohibited from conducting operations with any degree of success. During the past month the following applications for grants have been made and surveyed, viz. : \u2014 Applications. Ac. R. P.

The Chinese have a great predilection for puddling machines, and although it is difficult to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion touching their gains they are evidently satisfied, or they would be less ea^er in their applications for their grants. This is more apparent * Extended areas for machinery. * In that Report Mr. Poenpel says:\u2014\" In German Gully a new reef has been opened, styled the 'Cornish Reef.' This is not a reef in reality, but simply a series of small leaders, running at different angles of incli nation from the surface. The hills in this division are noted for the immense number of quartz leaders of this descnption, and no sooner are they discovered to contain gold than they are at once recognised hv the miners as reefs I mention this in order that it may be properly understood.\" J"], [19, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 13 when the way in which they are enabled to enter int such undertakings is considered. From good authority I am led to believe that European speculators advance them the necessary capital in many instances, having the horses and plant as security for such advances, and charge enormous interest, viz., at the rate of \u00a3130 per cent, per annum. From this it may be reasonably inferred that puddling is a profitable occupation when these extra vagant conditions are subscribed to. The Chinese pay their countrymen wages at the rate of \u00a31 per week and rations. Union Mining Association, whose engine of 35 horse power is erected on the west side of Eaglehawk Reef, and Is now ready for commencing operations, both for relieving that reef of water, which prevents its being properly worked, and also for crushing the quartz from their amalgamated claim (527 feet in length). The engine works a new description of stamper, those being lifted by cams, which revolve in their descent over a small portion of the circumference. This arrangement causes an equal wear over the whole area of the crushers, and supersedes the necessity of their being lifted from their position so frequently to be turned. This engine is one of the best in the division, and is a great credit to the engineer (Mr. Ralph) who erected it. The Maldon Gold-Mining and Washing Company have an area of ground in Long Gully of nearly 8 acres. This ground has been extremely rich. The engine is about 20 horse-power, and has attached to it one of Hart's machines for washing, and wUl re quire a great quantity of water to keep it constantly at work. This company will begin work next week. The Porcupine Flat Gold-Mining Company have not begun their operations on a large scale. They are making a large dam in the centre of the gully 66 feet by 132 feet. It is nearly completed. They have an area of ground of about 9\u00a3 acres. The Bee- Hive Reef Quartz-Mining Association, originated but a fortnight since, have applied for and ob tained an amalgamated claim of 740 feet, and it is expected to be one of the most prosperous companies at Tarrengower. All the shares are taken up, and I myself saw on that reef beautiful gold taken from the surface which would yield upwards of 20oz. to the ton. Quartz Reefs, Machinery, &c. \u2014 Cornish and Spanish Reef. \u2014 This reef, from its first being worked, pro mised well, not only hi the prospecting claim, but in three or four others adjoining, and in every claim gold has been struck. Since my last Report,* the average yield has been from 2oz. to 3oz. to the ton. This yield has so far satisfied the parties that it would not answer their purpose to sink deeper in search of richer veins. A party next to the prospecting claim have recently discovered a leader at a depth of 24 feet from the surface. This vein commenced at about 1 inch in thickness, gradually increasing to 3 feet, dipping to the north at an angle of about 40 degrees. The stone from this surpasses any in richness ever dis covered in the district. It is calculated to yield from 30oz. to 40oz. to the ton. The stone is coated with a layer of slate, and loose gold has been found imbedded in it to the depth of 1 inch. In a dishful of this con glomerate (?) half an ounce of gold was washed at a trial. Golden Gully. \u2014 Pelcher and party, who have been working quartz-reefs for the last three years with some degree of success, are now erecting an eight horse-power horizontal steam-engine, to drive 12 heads of stamps, weighing 4\u00a3 cwt. each, and three shaking tables. They will have sufficient power to crush 80 tons of quartz a week, 24 hours a day. This party will be in a position to crush for the public to the extent of 40 tons per week, at the rate of \u00a31 per ton, exclu sive of cartage. The claims upon Ferron's Reef are furnishing good wages to those employed. Heron's Reef, which has been worked during the past two years, is now comparatively deserted. Clark's Reef. \u2014 The prospecting claim of this reef, which was remarkably rich, is now entirely deserted. The prospects of the Golden Gully Reefs are not par ticularly flourishing at the present time. Prospecting. \u2014 During the past fortnight an associa tion has been formed with the view of promoting quartz prospecting, composed of those who take some interest in the prosperity of the district. 1 hey pro- pose to raise a fund by a subscription of 5s. per week, aud to send out parties proportionably to the amount raised. The Committee have not yet determined upon their mode of procedure, as to the manner of conduct ing their operations. In a few weeks it is expected their arrangements will be complete. Tunnelling \u2014 Tuunelling is assuming a very impor tant character in this district, but I am unable to for ward you full particulars on the present occasion. In my next report I hope to be in a position to give you every infomiation. Other companies are in a state of forwardness to work both Wilson's and Dixon's Reef at Long Gully. The sludge from the various puddlmg-machines threaten us at some time with inconvenience, but it is not inconvenient at present to any great extent. During the late heavy rains some portions of the roads in this neighborhood have fallen in where drives have extended underneath. The persons who caused the damage have been discovered, and fined for the offence. They were principally Chinese. The River Loddon will, no doubt, when spring ad vances, become busy with mining operations, both on its banks and in the low-lying localities parallel to the stream. Already two applications have been made for 10 acres each\u2014 one at Newstead, of which plans have been sent to the Chief Secretary's office. This, no doubt, is a good paying speculation, as the ground (the original bed of the river) is known to contain gold to the extent, in some places, of 3dwt. or 4dwt. to the tub. I beg to give it, with great respect, as my opinion, that both the maximum and minimum quantities are greatly in excess of what I think they should be. I should consider that from one to five acres should be the extent of ground granted to any applicant. At Cairn Curran another application has been made for 10 acres. The party who are at present engaged prospecting cannot fulfil the conditions required until their survey is completed. Hepburn Division. Maldon Division. (Ambrose Johnson, Mining Surveyor.) (W. A. Hadwen, Mining Surveyor.) Mr. Johnson's report consists principally of de scriptions of the strata shown on his geological plans and sections. Speaking of the auriferous drift (wash dirt), at Hepburn, he says, the wash-dirt shown on the vertical section by a blue color consists of gravel and pebbles, and is full of heavy sand stone and quartz boulders, averaging 3 or 4 feet in diameter. Above this wash-dirt there are alternate layers of a coarse drift sand, intersected by streaks of black clay, and thickly intermixed with charcoal. Next to this comes the basalt. Speaking of the shallow sinkings in the creek beds, he says, that they are from 6 to 10 feet in depth. The creek beds, on an average, are from 50 to 60 feet below the levels of the There is a considerable influx of Chinese at Sandy Creek, who have almost the monopoly of that ground, and it will thus, probably, be well prospected. On Thursday last, a beautifu nugget, weighing 97oz., was brought to the Bank of Victoria, and sold, by some Chinamen. The locality where the lump of gold was found is not known with certainty, but it is supposed to be from the neighborhood of Sandy Creek or Por cupine Flat. I have since been informed that it was taken from the former place. The various mining companies in this division may be said to be in a prosperous and healthy financialcon dition, without any exception. They comprise the"], [20, "14 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. but it appears to he running parallel to Bell-topper Lead. old watercourses, and they (the creek beds) have been payable throughout their whole length. In every in stance where an old lead has been intersected by the modern watercourse, the yield in the bed of the creek has been rich for a considerable distance downwards. The stuff on the banks and points where gold has been found, is distinguished from the stuff in the old gutters by the quantity of boulders of trap or basalt dis tributed through it. He reports on the quartz-reefs as follows :\u2014 On the eastern bank of Spring Creek gold has been found in one quartz-reef, and it has been prospected by diffe rent parties, but no payable gold obtained, and the reef is, therefore, at present abandoned. Doctor's Reef, Doctor's Gully.\u2014 In reference to this reef, I regret to say that my knowledge is very limited. The reef was originally discovered about three years ago, when, I am informed, some very rich ore was obtained ; but, owing to the inefficiency of the machinery then in use, and perhaps owing to the alluvial workings offering easier and less hazardous chances, no great efforts were made to trace the reefs ; and the yield decreasing, and the water proving a rather serious obstacle, the reef was ultimately aban doned. A few months ago it was taken up again, under Mining By-law No. 3, and a shaft was started ; but no reef having been struck, and a horse-whim proving insufficient to keep down the water, the party has again left. Sailors' Reef, Sailors' Creek. \u2014 This reef has been worked upwards of two years. It is bituate in the creek bed, and the owners have been compelled by the overflow of water to suspend operations. I shall at some future period have the honor to submit a vertical section, showing the reef and the workings. I am informed that a number of highly auriferous veins, lying almost horizontally, has been worked in this claim, and some 400 tons of quartz raised during the dry season, calculated to average 3 to 4 ounces ; and the owners, I understand, are at present making arrangements for the erection of steam machinery for crushing and baling purposes, the present crushing machine (worked by a waterwheel) and the pump (worked by horse-power) proving both expensive and nsufficient. The state of our quartz workings seems to attract attention on the other gold-fields, several parties of experienced quartz-miners having to my knowledge arrived quite recently, intending to prospect our reefs, and I am much mistaken if their efforts will not be rewarded. The Taradale Steam Gold-washing Compauy have commenced working. The machinery is substantially erected, and has worked well from the first starting. Their prospects are highly encouraging, and all feel confident of success ; although at present to speak with certainty would not be prudent, although a good prospect has been obtained from the ground. It is their intention to try the quartz-reef included in the grant. The Coliban Gold Mining Company are working a piece of ground Known as the Old Ironstone Hill, the property of D. S. Campbell, Esq. The hill has been worked before by the individual digger, who made handsome profits. One storekeeper, living on the hill, shows by his books that he purchased for the banks more than one ton of gold, coming from the hill. The hill itself is a basaltic outlyer, and the sinking on the same averages 90 feet, throught 40 feet of basalt. This newly-formed company have driven a tunnel 500 feet long, intersecting the lead, and now intend to continue the tunnel along the lead, and work the same from cross drives. The auriferous drift is in some places 16 feet in depth, and is divided by a false bottom into two distinct layers. The upper layer of auriferous drift realises 3dwt. to the ton. A large portion of the lower drift has not been worked, and from it they anticipate a handsome return. The machinery for washing the drift consists of four puddling-machines, driven by a 10 horse-power steam engine. (Mr. Shepard gives further information on his plans and sections.) The puddling-machines are doing well, and with an unlimited supply of water. A Prospecting Company is under formation, and warmly supported, to test the country between Fryer's Creek and Taradale, the appearance of which is highly promising, though it has not bean tried. The Taradale Quartz-reef continues to pay, and is in full work. The Swiss and French Reef has not been carried on .with the usual spirit. It is reported that gold is again lost. Two parties have commenced working Bell-topper Reef, but nothing can be expected from them at present. A reef not yet named has been discovered one mile and a half, towards Kyneton, from the French and Swiss Reef. Twelve shafts are sinking, two of which are obtaining payable gold. I will give a more detailed account of this reef in my next report, when it will be more opened up. On inquiring of many of the landowners of this division why thev refuse to let the land for mining purposes, they all stated the difficulty, trouble, and expense incurred by them in cases of disputes or en- croachment ; neither the magistrates nor warden having any jurisdiction, and refusing to act ; and the delay in obtaining justice rendered justice useless. When employed by owners of property to make under- ground surveys, 1 have been refused permission to pass down the shaft, and although an agreement had been signed, giving permission to descend the shaft, the magistrates could not act. I also find great difficulty in obtaining information from the miners relative to the workings. There are many owners of property who would lease the run of gold to a company, thereby avoiding the small contentions they would be sure to meet with from the miners, who now refuse to do so altogether. The richest lead in this division, the Bell-topper, has been traced from old Ironstone Hill to the River Coliban through private property, not worked, and many other leads are in the same state. The quartz- reefs, thought the best, are similarly situated, and unless some alteration in the law takes place the bulk of the gold m this division will remain buried for some time at least., As regards the general condition of our mines, I am happy to report a decided progress, the rainy weather during the last three week-** having enabled our sluicers and puddlers to resume operations in bank and hill claims. In Yandoit a rush took place yesterday, in conse quence of a 3^-ounce nugget having been found in a swamp or flat near King William's Gully ; and the Forty-Feet is steadily progressing. Taradale Division. (Thomas W. Shepard, Mining Surveyor.) The surveys made since my last report are as fol lows :_ Three under rule No. 15, and one under rule No. 4. The general state of the alluvial diggings cannot be said to have advanced. The flats and the gullies have too much water to admit of being worked with profit. ' The employment afforded by tho railway has in duced many to leave gold-seeking during tho winter months for steady remuneration. A new lead of gold was struck near Archdale's fence, Liberty Flat. The sinking is 90 feet, hard, and with about 40 feet of ironstone (basalt?) The holes that are bottomed have produced coarse gold and nuggets. Those on the lead will do very well. I am afraid there will not he room for many shafts, as the lead will run into private property. I am informed that as much as \u00a3100 was paid for a claim on private land.

(James Murphy, Mining Surveyor.) Quartz Mining. \u2014 During the past month, owing to the recent finds of gold on One-tree Hill, quartz mining has received a considerable impulse, and a good deal of quartz ground that had been abandoned for many months, is now taken up and is being worked. Many persons who were but recently employed on alluvial mining, and following every rush, are now settling down to the more certainly remunerative em- ployment of quartz mining; and if quartz crushing were done here as cheaply as it is on other gold-fields, I do not think there would he five per cent, of the population engaged in alluvial mining operations. The price of crushing here at present is \u00a32 per ton ; it should not exceed \u00a31. The mill-owners complain that there is not sufficient quartz raised to keep their mills constantly employed, but the cause is simply this : there is plenty of quartz that would yield a profit to the miners if the crushing were done at \u00a31 per ton, but will yield them nothing when they have to pay \u00a32. They, therefore, very naturally, and pro- perly too, decline raising quartz for the mere purpose of keeping the quartz-mills in work. I am convinced that if we had one power- ful machine to commence crushing at \u00a31 per ton, there would be work enough both for it and all the other machines, as then they would bo compelled to crush for the fair value of crushing, and an increased amount of quartz would be raised, and alluvial workings, except on a large scale, would be abandoned in this district, and the semi- vagrant digger would settle down and become a re- spectable miner. Allen's Reef, on the Yew Yew, which had been aban- doned for some months, is riow occupied to its whole extent; and, from the discovery of a new vein running nearly parallel to that formerly worked, it is believed that this ground will pay well, if worked. This is the quartz-reef in close proximity to which I found a mineral which I believe to be identical with meer- schaum, and which I mentioned in one of my reports. At Swedish Reef, on One-tree Hill, a very great de- gree of energy is being displayed, every claim is occu- pied, and shafts are going down in the new claims at a rate unprecedented on the gold-fields. All are san- guine of success. The Victoria Reef , on One-tree Hill, is partially aban- doned, there being now only three claims at work on that reef. This is owing to the reef running very thin, being only about three inches in thickness, and the working being in an exceedingly hard, tough blue slate. It has become very difficult for the miners to get out quartz sufficient to pay, the average yield of gold at a depth of 85 feet being under three ounces to a ton of quartz. Another new reef has been opened on the road be tween Queenstown and the Kangaroo Ground, which shows gold; but beyond the simple fact of its being opened, nothing can be said until the yield of gold is ascertained by crushing. At Anderson's Creek a claim of 600 yards by 200 yards of quartz ground, on the Fourth Hill, has been applied for under the leasing regulations, by Messrs. Moore and Gerraty, who contemplate running adits into the hill from two gullies admirably situated for the purpose, and by that means to intersect the nu-l Alluvial Mining. \u2014 In this branch of mining there is nothing worth noting, except that Messrs. Clarke and Brown have at last commenced operations at Thomp son's Creek, on the Yarra. About 25 men are now em ployed in cutting a canal through which to divert the course of the river, and by that means to lay dry the bed of the river, for the purpose of taking out the auriferous drift and the clay seams from the crevices of tbe slate rock which forms the bed of the river. It is proposed to form this canal with a top width of 50 feet and slopes of 1 to 1, and taking the probable depth at 12 feet, will give 14 feet of bottom width, and a sectional area of 384 feet, which will be about suffi cient to carry an average winter's flood in this river. The sectional area of the summer water is about 90 feet, flowing at the rate of about two miles an hour. The estimated cost of the above undertaking, viz., canal, dams, and the necessary machinery, is said to be \u00a37,000. The sluice-washing operations, commenced some time since at the junction of Anderson's Creek with the Yarra, both as a piece of work and as a specula tion, have ended in failure. On the one part, owing to the inability of the parties concerned to make the dam sufficiently watertight, and on the other the unnecessarily heavy expenses incurred by the manage ment. At the Dandenong gold-field, the population has diminished fully two- thirds, it being almost impossible to work there, owing to the wetness of the place. It is not probable that this gold-field will be developed until next summer ; the locality being much colder and wetter than any other part of this district, few people like staying here during the winter months. At Whipstick Gully, Anderson's Creek, an extended claim of three acres has been applied for, under rule 25 of the by-laws, bjr Dr. Owens, on which he is about to erect one of his recently-patented puddling machines. The tables prepared by Mr. Murphy show that at Anderson's Creek three persons are engaged in quartz mining, and 38 in alluvial mining ; at Caledonia 115 are engaged in quartz mining, and 625 in alluvial mining ; and at Dandenong 70 are engaged in alluvial mining. The total population engaged in mining in the district is 851, of which 210 are Chinese. Of the quartz miners, 105 are engaged in actual mining, and 13 as quartz-crushers ; of alluvial miners, 20 are employed at puddling-machines, 105 at sluicing, 12 at torn washing, and 596 with the tub and cradle.

BALLAARAT MINING DISTRICT, the same time ; these companies arc, therefore, di- vided into parties (termed watches or shifts) of from 8 to 12 men, and, while one shift is at work, the whole of the other shifts are lying idle ; so that in a com- pany of 1)6 men, eight shifts of 12 men, or 12 shifts of eight men, and, supposing each shift to work for a space of six hours at each time, in the former instance, each man would have only worked six hours out of the 48 hours, and, in the latter instance, only six hours out of tbe 72 hours, the intermediate time being either spent in idleness, or in endeavoring to eke out a subsistence by working at some other occu- pation. I am aware that the sinking of the shaft is in itself un remunerative labor, and, even after tho shaft is sunk, it is necessary to perform a con- siderable amount of work in making drives before the whole of the shareholders in a large com- pany can be profitably employed, yet we find, in spite of all these drawbacks, added to the enormous interest paid for money for the purchase of machinery, &c, and the general insufficiency of the machinery employed, owing to the absence of capital necessary to purchase machinery of a more powerful aud effi- cient character, the yield of these leads is such as to give wages of from 8s. to 10s. per diem throughout. I have no hesitation in saying, that under proper management, and with all the appliances which capital well directed would introduce, that a shaft, which under the present system of mining occupies from one and a half to two years in sinking, might be sunk in from 9 to 12 months, and at less than half tho cost. The auriferous ground might be worked out in much less time than is at present spent upon it, and with considerably fewer men, so, taking the lowest estimate as given above of the returns under the present system of mining, by the employment of men at the current rate of wages (which is on Ballaarat at \u00a32 10s. to \u00a33 per week), a good profit would accrue to the capitalists. Third. The increased size of claims, and the facilities for the employment of hired labor under a by-law lately passed by the Mining Board, ai e further inducements to capitalists. No. 1 Division. (Robert Davidson, Mining Surveyor.) During the past month mining operations have been pursued with meres sed energy ; a good deal of speculation in the purchasing of shares has been entered into on the leads in this division, a proof in itself that a larger amount of gold has been obtained than the average quantity yielded during the pre ceding month. Inkermann Lead. \u2014 This lead is paying remarkably well. It is difficult to obtain reliable information as to the quantity of gold obtained by any company in particular, but I think I may state (as being correct) that three companies, viz., the Great Republic, Inde pendent, and Kangaroo, have obtained, during the past month, 4,200 ounces. The individual remunera tion in some of those companies has been as much as \u00a300 per week. Golden Point, Malakoff, and Milkmaid's Leads. \u2014 The miners on those leads have not been remunerated to the same extent as those on the Inkermann. The difficulties to be overcome in mining on those leads are very great, and the expenses necessarily incurred in overcoming those difficulties reduce considerably what would, under more favorable circumstances, be an increase on the remuneration now received. Quartz Reef, \u2014 There has been very little labor per formed in this branch of mining during the past month in this division. The only reef that is being worked is situate on the western township, and is known as the Township Quartz-Reef. The average yield from this reef is about two ounces of gold to the ton. Resources of the Division. \u2014 I am of opinion that this division presents a fine field for the invest ment of capital. The data upon which that opinion is formed is as follows :\u2014 First. The various deep leads which are now being worked on the western township are converging, and will eventually join, forming one main gutter. Second. The average yield of those several leads is such as to induce me to believe that, under a proper system of wurking, they would be highly lucrative. In the present co-operative companies, the whole of the bhareholders (sometimes amounting to 100 persons) arc engaged in sinking the shaft, in which not more than from 8 to 12 men can bo employed at one and [Mr. Davidson doe3 not furnish tables relating to population and machinery, as required by the in structions.] No. 2 Division.

There are three engines, of t o aggregate of 62 horse-power. Thoro arc three quartz- crush ing ma chines, and the number of stamps employed is 38, There are 78 miners obtaining gold by hand-labor, and 9S obtaining gold by machinery, aud there are 54 miners not obtaining gold. There are 24 windlasses and whims. Mr. Cowan states that the above abstracts have been arrived at from information obtained by visiting each claim, but cannot be considered as fully reliable, especially with regard to the Chinese, there being a very general disinclination to give any infor mation. There are copious notes attached to Mr. Cowan's tables.] The general characteristic of my division is a suc cession of hills and valleys, formed by the clayslate and sandstone rocks, presenting what are known in this country by the names of ranges and gullies. The general direction of the ranges is easterly and westerly, and the small gullies run down the sides of the various ranges mostly to the northward and southward, falling into main valleys on each side of the main range, and necessarily following the same general direction. In various parts of the ranges quartz lodes are found of various sizes, in many places cropping out upon the surface. exceed 12 feet, so that the miners almost generally wash the strata from the surface to the bed reef by means of puddling-machines, of which there are 103 in the division. Six of these are worked by steam engines, of the total value of \u00a3700, and the remaining 97 by horses. Supposing the value of each machine to be \u00a310, and the value of each horse at work at the machine \u00a320, and the total value of tramways, wag gons, &c., for the purpose of conveying the auriferous earth to the machines, about \u00a31,000, it will be seen that the sum of \u00a34,510 is embarked in this branch of mining. Of the large number of sluicing companies which were engaged last winter, I regret to say that there are only two companies at present working. The failure of the other companies I attribute to the insufficiency of water, and to the difficulty of managing the hard clayey soil which they attempted to wash. Perhaps the principal causes assignable for the scarcity of water are the great lentrth of the races and the loose porous soil through which they were cut. The total length of the races in this division is about nine miles (?), of which no more than 25 miles (?) are at present of any use. Of surfacing, 1,012,500 superficial square feet, or about 23 acres, have been taken possession of Bince the 12th of May last, and the number of men entitled to this area is 102. From the quartz-lodes there can bo but little doufct that the gold has been carried down by water or other means in deep channels or creeks, by which means the different leads of gold have been formed. The topa and sides of the ranges are also, for the most part, covered with surfacing or auriferous ground near the surface, which, though hitherto but little worked, on account of the supposed small quantity of gold con tained therein, will offer a large field for the employ ment of improved machinery, when a system of water supply for mining purposes shall have been carried out. On old ground, averaging less than 50 feet in depth, 97 men have taken up claims occupying an area of 121,250 superficial square feet, or about 2a. 2r. 38p. ; while on old ground, whose average depth is over 50 feet, 38 men have taken claims. The area occupied by this number of men is 93,100 superficial square feet, or 2a. Or. 27p., making altogether an area of 28a. Or. 9p., or at the rate of 14 acres per month. Quartz. \u2014 No new claims for quartz-mining have been taken during the last two months, though, within a parallel of three miles, no less than nine distinct reefs are visible. The total number of men now engaged in quartz-mining over the whole district does not exceed 60, and of this number about 46 are working on the Black Hill. The different levels on which they work range from 50 feet to 100 feet from the surface. The miners on this hill, for the most part, crush the quartz with a hand hammer, and yet they obtain, per man, no less than \u00a36 per week, and frequently the weekly earnings per man exceed \u00a310. A new company has erected a quartz-crushing engine of 40-horse power in contiguity to the workings, and, having secured a large lease hold, I hope in a short time to see the old hill com pletely worked out. Alluvial Mining. \u2014 It will be seen from the tables which I furnish herewith, and the tables already forwarded, that the largest class of workings is com prised under the head of alluvial mining. In this class are comprised all those claims upon which shafts are sunk, for the purpose of working the auriferous stratum, the depth of such shafts, in my district, varying from a few feet t > 200 feet. The cost of sink ing such shafts varies with the nature of the ground to be sunk through, and the quantity of water to be combatted. The cost of sinking is in no case a criterion of the richness of the ground. These shafts are, in most cases, lined with slabs of wood, with a row of slabs down the centre of the shaft, so as to form two compartments\u2014 an arrange ment which, whilst it gives additional strength, mate rially aids in the ventilating of the mine. The usual length of the slabs is about five feet for those placed at the longer sides of the shaft, and three feet for those placed at the shorter sides. The short slabs are usually termed \" end slabs,\" and the long ones \" side slabs.\" The usual thickness of these slabs is about 2\u00a3 inches, and they are of sufficient durability to allow of a shaft being worked for two or three years, with but a slight expense for repairs. No. 3 Division. (Thomas Cowan, Mining Surveyor.) [From the elaborate tables furnished by Mr. Cowan it appears that there are 539 Europeans and 336 Chi nese engaged in surfacing and paddocking in the divi sion. There are 82 surfacing claims, 7 paddocking claims, and 1 claim held on lease. There are 10 engines of the aggregate of 104-horse power. There are 89 horse-puddling machines, employing 89 horses, and 20 steam-puddling machines. The average depth of the wash-dirt in the division is 7$ feet, and the average depth of paddocking 14 feet 9 inches. There are 60 miners engaged on works not at present yield ing gold, and there are 4 puddling-machines idle. Of those engaged in deep sinking tine are 474 Europeans and 868 Chinese. There are 141 claims on old ground, 18 block claims, 4 prospecting claims, and 1 claim held on lease. There are 4 engines of the aggregate of 37 horse power. There are 145 horse-puddling machines, 3 steam-puddling machines, and 102 horse-whims. There are 65 windlasses. The average depth of the washdirt is 3 feet 5 inches, and the average depth of the shafts 120 feet. The capital expended is estimated at \u00a318,228. There are 80 miners working and not ob taining gold ; they are engaged in preliminary works. There are 19 puddling-machines and 40 whims idle. There are engaged upon quartz-claims 230 Europeans. There are 26 claims, nine of which are prospecting The deep workings in my district usually contain a large quantity of water, and are for that reason very difficult to work, and very trying to tho constitution of the miners. Surfacing. \u2014 Surface workings include all those in which the surface soil to a depth of three or four feet is washed. In these workings no shafts are sunk, but the whole of the stuff is passed through a puddling machine or sluice, or in some instances through both. The general character of the surfacing in my dis trict is clayey ; and the gold cannot be separated from the earth except by means of puddling-machines. To this may be attributed, to some extent, the failure of the many companies which were formed not long since to carry on large sluicing operations, as it was found"], [27, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 5 that the clay did not dissolve in passing from one end of the sluice to the other ; and a large quantity of gold was consequently lost. market prices, amount to about 600/. ; and for this outlay two shares of gold would readily be given. Supposing each share to amount to \u00a32 per week (and I am confident that in many cases it would be much more), the furnisher would receive a large per-centago on his outlay. The machinery would, to a certain extent, deteriorate in value, though to a very small extent. An agreement might be made compelling the working party to return the plant in as good working order as when received \u2014 an agreement which could easily be complied with, as the most expensive part of the plant may be considered as imperishable property. At the present time there are only two sluicing com panies at work in this district, the others having dis continued operations long since. A number of com panies are, however, engaged in working surfacing and shallow old ground claims by means of steam or horse puddling-machines. When steam power is employed, the stuff is usually drawn from the \" face\" in trucks by the engine, which at the same time pumps and works the puddling machine. It is almost unnecessary to say that machinery may in some instances be put upon ground which will not pay ; but even in these instances the only risk to the furnisher would be the slight expense in removing the plant. Steam puddling will undoubtedly become a large branch of mining industry in the district, as well as in the other portions of the district of Ballaarat. Quartz Mining. \u2014 Quartz-mining comprises that branch of mining industry that is devoted to the working of auriferous quartz lodes. This branch of mining industry has up to a recent period received but little attention in my district, as the quartz lodes were generally supposed to be unremunerative. Sub sequent experience has shown that quartz-mining can be profitably carried on in this district, and the ex perience which is being gained every day will pro bably lead to the opening up of a large area of ground now lying idle. I am, however, strongly of opinion that such cases would be very rare, as the ground could be tested to ascertain if the prospects were such as to justify the erection of machinery. I am induced to make these remarks from the desire to give your hon. Board correct information as to the actual condition of mining operations in this district, and to apprise capitalists of the opportunities of profitable investment, as erroneous impressions must have gone abroad by reason of the failure of several companies, which were formed and conducted by men so totally unacquainted with the requirements of mining operations, that it was a matter of impos sibility for them to succeed. For the general return received from quartz-mining I heg to refer you to the annexed table. (See extracts therefrom.) Settlement of the District.\u2014 Within the last year great progress has been made in the settlement of the district, and a marked improvement is observable in the dwellings of the miners generally. Where not very long since uncomfortable calico tents were seen, there now exist a large number of comfortable wooden houses. In fact, on Ballaarat Proper the tent is fast being superseded by the wooden house, and in many places neat gardens give a settled and pictu resque appearance to the locality. A comparison of the present table with that formerly sent, will enable you to judge of the changes which have taken place during the interval. It will be seen that there is a decrease in the number of Chinese miners in my district. I find great difficulty in obtaining accurate informa tion, from the absence of proper records of the opera tions of the various companies ; and I would suggest that it should be ma' le incumbent upon the secretary of each company to keep a book in which should be entered a statement of the works carried on, and the yield of gold obtained, such book to be open to the inspection of any authorised officer. It must, however, be admitted that a large number of the miners still reside in very uncomfortable habi tations, and an improvement is highly desirable in this respect. The working of the ground in large areas has con duced greatly to a settlement of the district ; as the miners, knowing that they will be occupied for a length of tune in one locality, have, in many instances, erected substantial and permanent residences. General Remarks. \u2014 Though most of the mining in the district is carried on on old ground, yet there is still of that description of ground a large area available, which, with efficient machinery, would give a sufficient remuneration to repay the cost of working. From the Chinese miners very little reliable infor mation can be obtained, and their average earnings can only be ascertained by a comparison of the known yield of the ground with the scanty details they fur nish. Division No. 4. (Michael O'Malley, Mining Surveyor.) My division may be briefly described as comprising tnree deep rock leads (\"Frenchman's,\" \"White Horse,\" aud \" Cobbler's\"), upon which expensive steam engines have been erected ; and three mining localities (\" Whim-Holes,\" \" Paddy's Gully,\" and \" Italian Gully\"), which, though in many instances sufficiently auriferous to remunerate an extensive and well ordered system of working, are not yet properly de veloped, nor even well prospected, for want of capital among the miners, who have worked them in spots here and there as best they could, or as their slender means would admit. But, sooner or later, it is pretty certain that these localities will be taken in hand by a class of men different from those hitherto in occupa tion of them, and I am satisfied that, with the aid of suitable machinery, these localities, as well as a large portion of the surrounding country, would be found to yield handsome returns, both to the capitalist aud the working miner. Machinery.\u2014 The following tabulated form gives tho total number of steam-engines, together with their aggregate horse-power and value ; and also the total number and aggregate value of tho puddling-machines employed at present in the district ;\u2014 The reason this ground has not already been taken possession of is on account of the very great difficulty there is of obtaining the requisite machinery for pro perly working it. The miners are too poor to ad vance the necessary capital for its purchase, they are, therefore, compelled to give a certain number of shares from the yield of gold for the machinery. Though the miners are prepared in most cases to give a large per-centage of the gold for the machinery, yet it is with thegreatesT'difficulty that they can ob tain machinery capable of working their ground on these very liberal terms. This circumstance is tbe prin cipal reason that a large portion of the ground is still unoccupied. From my experience, I am enabled to state that the description of mining called surfacing, or paddocking, is of a remunerative character ; the machinery requisite for working this description of mining*, when about 1G men are employed, consists of an engine about 12 horse-power, two puddling-ma chines, winding gear, sluice-boxes or cradle, trucks, rope, shovels, picks, and othe*\" small implements. The cost of this plant would, according to present"], [28, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 6 Before proceeding;, it may bo repiuisitc to state that my reason for selecting these particular companies is, because they hold the only claims in which a gutter has been sufficiently worked since I came to this dis trict to enable me to make any calculation.

Finally, it may not be amiss to state that I learned from some intelligent and trustworthy persons in the \" Prince of Wales\" Company, that the water-produc ing seams or fissure? in the rock, when running in a north and south direction, were found to give forth a greater volume of water than when running in any other direction. NO. 5, OR BUNINTONG DIVISION. (James W. K. Pringle, Mining Surveyor.) On account of not having obtained the returns from several of the secretaries to claims, about which I felt anxious to give you an account, 1 have been delayed in sending this, and am now compelled to forward it with only a portion of the information I had in tended. The general condition ofthe mines at present being worked is anything but prosperous ; the great depth of sinking, want of capital, misapplication of labor, and, above all, the insufficient area of the claims, have had a tendency to create such a depression in the mining interest as has not been previously experienced in this district. Until mining on deep leads is conducted on a much more extended system than is now prevalent, I fear thc present poverty among the miners so occu pied will not only continue, but in all probability, in crease. Hundreds of men employed on deep leads have, through actual destitution, left their shares, which in course of time are taken up and again aban doned, aud so on until gold is obtained, when the shareholders then holding interests in the claim reap the benefit of the money expended by the original owners. This is most painfully exemplified on the Durham Lead, and so as to show the los3 sustained by the commmuty, I have obtained from the secretaries of several companies an account of the expenses and amount of gold received. The two companies to which I shall now more parti- cularly draw your attention as illustrative of the ruin- ous effect of the present co-operative system, are the '* Champion of the Seas\" Company, holding a 424 feet frontage claim, and the \"All Nations\" Company, hold- ing a frontage claim of 036 sect on the Durham Lead.

If this ground of 3,790 feet had been worked by one company, properly organised, I am of opinion that about one-third of the money expended up to the pre sent time would have been sufficient to have worked it completely and profitably, even at the present rate of yield; but it is expected that the companies not ye'i in the gutter will be better paid in proportion to their amount of ground than those already in it have been, on account of the junction with Scotchman's and other leads proved to be running towards the Durham. As it is generally believed the Durham will prove the main channel into which most of the leads in this dis- t.rict will empty themselves, it may not be with out interest to give an account of the different strata sunk through. The shaft I have selected for this purpose is the Telegraph, on account of its being situated below the anticipated points of junction with the Scotchman's, Ryder's, Kitty's, and Green Hills Leads. Commencing from the surface, the first stratum met with is a dark loam, 4 feet in thickness. Immediately under this the basalt rock was struck, through which the shaft was sunk to a depth of 149 feet, without any material change, excepting that, as the depth increased, the rock became harder and contained a greater amount of water ; at 149 feet a bed of coarse white drift sand 2 feet, in thickness, out of which an almost insurmountable volume of water came ; at 151 feet a bed of hard grey cemented sand, perfectly dry, and 12 feet in thickness ; at 163 feet a bed of white gravel, with quartz boulders, 6 feet in thick ness, containing a considerable amount of water, and not unlike some of the wash-dirt found at bottoms of creeks, but no gold could be dis covered, although the drift was carefully tested ; be neath this, and at a depth of 109 feet, the second basalt rock, 51 feet in thickness, and interspersed with layers of \"honeycomb,\" containing water; at 220 feet the \"sandstone reef\" is struck, and through which the shaft is continued to a depth of 300 feet. A drive, 60 feet in length, has been opened towards the deep ground, but so far the gutter has not been ob tained. The following table shows the machines employed :\u2014 Although the Scotchman's Lead creates greater in terest than any other lead in my district, I am unable to give any accurate account of it, nor will I be in a position to give reliable information until it has been worked through Learmonth's pre-emptive right and into Crown lands. All the companies on it at present have their shafts sunk in private property, consequently I cannot without permission make any survey, or use any information obtained when making a survey. I at first intended to embrace the entire district within the scope of this report, but I find that this would have the effect of swelling it to immoderate dimensions, or else precluding matter of consequence ; I have, therefore, determined upon confining myself, for the present, to the portion of the country deline ated on the accompanying tracings, as being the oldest and most important section of this vast auriferous For several weeks past the mining population has been gradually decreasing, vast numbers having left for the superior attractions of the new leads at Brown's Diggings. At the present time I estimate the number of bona side miners at 4,000, out of which there are nearly 1,000 Chinese. The workings have been very deep and expensive, and many miners have been obliged to go to other places where gold is more accessible, with the inten tion of making enough to defray the expenses of a share in this district ; and until capital can be more plentifully invested, and on much easier terms than at present, I am afraid this subdivision will not hold the position among the various gold-fields which it is entitled to as a mining district on account of its mineral resources. district, reserving my remarks upon the outlying places, viz. : \u2014 Linton's, Carngham, Snake Valley, and the various gullies in the neighborhood of Brown's pre-emptive right \u2014 for the next, or some future oc- casion. The topographical appearance of Smythesdale is that of an extensive valley running north-east and south-west for a distance of four miles, and varying in width from half a mile to a mile. It is bounded on either side by slightly elevated ranges, which are indented by numerous gullies running east and west west, and terminating in the two dividing ranges which separate the Carngham district on.the west, and the Buninyong district on the east, each distant about Locality.

The whole of the valley, or basin, of Smythesdale is filled up to a tolerably uniform level with the debris of the surrounding ranges, the depth of which is found to vary from 10 to 120 feet, in ac- cordance with the undulating structure of the sedi- mentary strata below. From discoveries made by mining operations, the ancient river-course in the schistose rock has been along the eastern margin of the ranges, and is inter- sected on either side by a few tributaries of limited ex- tent, as shown upon the tracing. The present course of the river is now along the base of the western ranges, about 400 feet from its original course. It is a singular fact that, upon the summits of the highest hills bordering the valley, very rich deposits of gold have been found on the surface of the micaceous sand- stone and schist, of which these hills are composed. These deposits are covered to a depth of from 5 to 30 feet by alternating layers of ferruginous sand and gravel, which have obtained solidity from the cement- ing qualities of the matter thrown together. From the circumstance of such deposits being found in situations so elevated, it must be inferred that tho adjoining valleys were at one period filled up to the same level, and in all probability the auriferous quartz was more generally distributed throughout the debris covering the ancient sedimentary strata, and that, by continuous aqueous action, the denuded rocks, toge- ther with light substances, have been in great part carried down into the sea of deposit on the plains lying southward in the shape of micaceous earth and fine siliceous sands ; thus leaving on the bottom, ot what is universally on the diggings termed leads or gutters, a deposit of simple auriferous quartzose gravel, which owes its present position to its superior gravity. The force of the various agents which have tended to the subsequent tilting up of the valley or basin, and the different conditions of the earth's surface, is clearly proved by the sections obtained in the different shafts sunk down to the rock. known of which is Watson's Hill, Mullachy Point, German Hill, Monkey, Budgron's, and Tuckor's Hills, tho respective situations of which are shown upon tho tracing. The range itself is in several places abruptly broken up by numerous intersecting gullies, extend- ing to the dividing ranges already alluded to. Tho whole of this basin, as in the case of Smythe's, is filled up to a tolerably uniform level ; the alluvial de- posit varying from 10 to 180 feet in thickness, and this deposition was effected in the manner already described. The first auriferous ground met with at the northern extremity of Smythesdale is the Camp flat, where some deposits were found, in shallow ground bordering on the creek. From this place the ground was found to deepen towards the south-cast, and in the Rose Company's shaft a depth of 50 feet of alluvial drift and clay has been sunk through to the bottom rock. The deep ground in this particular place is supposed to be rich, but the excessive quantity of water met with in the drift has hitherto prevented its satisfactory de- velopment. The line of deep ground indicating the course of the ancient river-bed (as shown on the tracing) is now being traced to the southward, and will undoubtedly prove to be a continuation of the same river-bed which several companies have been engaged in taking out for the last two years on Warren's, and its con- tiguous leads. Intermediate between Warren's and the northern end of Smythe's a new lead, called the Roxborough Castle Lead, has been lately declared on the frontage system. The prospecting hole is 74 feet deep, and indications lead to the supposition that it is the continuation of the river-bed already found in the Rose claim, already adverted to. 52 claims have been registered, amalga- mating has been effected on the whole lead, and active operations are commenced. The yield is about 2oz. to the load ; the gold is found in tolerably large grains, or, in mining phraseology, is \"nuggetty gold.\" The width of the gutter is about 20 feet, and the thickness of tho wash-dirt about 2 feet. To the south-east of the Roxborough Castle Lead, at the point indicated on the tracing, a distinct lead has been discovered, at a depth of 65 feet. It was proclaimed, on the frontage system, on the 2nd of July inst., and 39 claims were surveyed and registered. The width [of this gutter is 20 feet, and the thickness of the wash-dirt is about 2\u00a3 feet. The boulders amongst which the gold lies are very large, and the lead is a promising one. It is called the Argyle Lead. The necessary steps for the amalgamation of claims, with the view of cheapening the sinking of shafts, have been taken, and the companies will in a few days be in active working order. From the Pioneer Claim, on the Norfolk Lead (shown on'plan), a branch lead has been traced, and eight claims were registered on it on the 30th ult. In all probability this is a continuation of the Argyle Lead, if not a junction of the three leads, viz., Roxborough Castle, Argyle, and Pioneer, which may be expected at the point \u2014 on plan. The Norfolk Lead, proceeding from the western range in the direction traced on the map, was disco- vered in October, 1857. It is now worked out and abandoned, with the exception of the Pioneer Com- pany, in whose claim the tributary now proclaimed as the Pioneer Lead was found. The Norfolk was a tolerably rich lead. The depth of sinking was from 70 to 110 feet. As it progressed from the prospecting claim it became less valuable, and depreciation arose from the gutter merging into a wide flat. That portion of the basin which we now come to is called Warren's Lead. It was first sunk upon in Fe- bruary, 1857, at the base of Fraser's Hill, at a depth of about 70 feet, and it was surveyed on the frontage system, and about 70 claims were taken up ; the prospect found in the first claims being eucoura*nng Whilst the gutter occupied a narrow width the wash- dirt proved very rich, but it soon merged into a kind of lagoon, extending, in some places, over 500 feet ; and from the circumstance of the wide distribution of the auriferous drift, the gold is found so thinly scattered as to be scarcely worth tho expense of taking it out It will appear from sections Nos. , that after the deeper portion of the basin through which the ancient river held its course had been denuded of its covering, that nature had for a long period subsided into a quiescent state, affording time for the develop ment of vegetable life ; and the fossil remains of various plants and trees (specimens of which I shall send), found in the argillaceous deposits immediately above the auriferous gravel already described, show that a very long period of repose had occurred. The section will also show the intensity of the aqueous action at different periods while the process of filling up was &oing on, by the appearance presented by the different layers which form the superincumbent covering. At the southern extremity of Smythesdale another agent, in addition to the aqueous, has assisted in filling up the most depressed portions of the original surface. The first appearance of igneous rock is met with at the shaft of the Great Eastern, Warren's Lead, within a narrow strip, extending north and south. This rock (a species of trap) when first struck is quite thin, but increases in thickness towards the south, and after passing the gorge which communicates with the basin of Browne's, it spreads into a wide expanse, bordering on Smythe's Creek from the western to the eastern ranges, and continues its course to the plains south ward of the Woady Yallock. Browne's Diggings. \u2014 We now come to that part known as Browne's diggings. The physical structure of Browne's diggings, which are contiguous to Smythes dale, suggests at once, even to the most casual obser ver, the most striking features of a rich gold-field. The longest diameter of the basin is about two miles, and the shortest about three-quarters of a mile. It is surrounded on all sides, except at the gorge already alluded to, connecting it with Smythesdale, by a bluff schistose range, numerously intersected with quartz veins. The ranges, like those mentioned in Smythes dale, have proved in some patches very rich \u2014 the best"], [31, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 9 There arc five companies working upon this section of the district, each having engines from 10 to 15 horse power. The Britannia Company have an old land grant; the British and American have a claim on the frontage system ; the Perseverance Company held a Mining Board extension of 8 acres ; the abandoned Junction have a Mining Board extension ; the Great Eastern are on the frontage system ; and the Great Western have applied for a lea^e of 20 acres. The size and position of these claims, and their respective shafts, are accurately laid down on the tracing. It is in the shaft of the Great Eastern that basalt rock makes its first appearance \u2014 a Thin seam, gradually thickening to the south. A tributary from the western range, south of Fraser's Hill, falls into the gutter in the southern part of the claim. It was declared on the frontage system in February last, under the name of the Red. White, and Blue Lead. Over 50 claims have been registered on it; but beyond No. 13 the lead has not yielded sufficient to pay the labor of working it. Beyond No. 13 it rises rapidly, and, like all tributaries here, terminates in the side of the range above. The depth of the prospecting claims is 116 feet; the width of the gutter about 20 feet ; and the thick ness of the wash-dirt in some places is 4 feet. This has, for the length of the 13 claims just mentioned, proved the richest lead in the district ; the general yield being estimated at 5oz. per cube yard. It is very inexpensive \u2014 no other machinery than horse whims being* required for it. It is also remarkable for the numerous remains of trees and other vegetable fossils found in the auri ferous deposits overlying the wash-dirt. They are generally in a good state of preservation, the fibres being sound and distinct. Judging from appearance, vegetation must have been of a very scanty descrip tion at the period when the surface of this part of the country was deluged ; and this would in all pro bability arise from the short interval of repose inter vening between the aqueous period preceding and that which caused the destruction of vegetable life which we have been considering. To return to Warren's Lead. I have some time ago heard that \u00a370,000 had been completely lost on it. With the exception of the Great Eastern Lead Com pany, no other has obtained returns equivalent to the lowest wages in the country. I have, at the same time, no doubt that by giving large areas it might be profitably worked, as the cause of previous failure is as much owing to the inadequacy of the claims as to the poverty of the ground. The celebrated rule 80 of the Mining Board was manifestly intended to meet cases of this description, by giving larger areas than those mentioned in the regulations w here the ground was known to be too poor to pay for the labor of working it ; but this salu - tary rule, after having been acted upon for more than 12 months, and after thousands of pounds had been ex pended in capital and labor on the faith of its validity, is now pronounced to be illegal, and, consequently, all the claims held under it untenable. In no other district, perhaps, will the want of that most beneficial rule be more sensibly felt, as there are vast areas of deep alluvial land here with gold so sparsely dissemi nated through it that the ordinary-sized claims would never pay for the labor and expense of collecting it, as, by the time the claim would be wholly worked out, the cost of the machinery would hardly be liqui dated ; but as the poverty of such giound would be compensated for by a sufficieiu enlargement of the claims suitable to each particular case, the Mining Board wisely sought to meet the difficulty in that way, and succeeded In inducing occupation of the ground, which otherwise would have remained to the present time idle and unproductive, and whieh will relapse into that condition again until the void which the abolition of that rule has begot be supplied. South of the Great Western Company's is Warren's Lead, and immediately adjoining it a lease of 6 acres is held by the Beaumont Company, who are blasting through the rock, and are nearly 30 feet through it ; and next is the Caledonian Company, whose applica tion for a lease of 30 acres has been forwarded. In this company's ground the ancient river-bed contracts its width to about 150 feet. It is intersected by a tri butary from the eastern ranges, called the German Lead, which has been something more productive than the main channel. There is another party working towards the shallow end of this lead with a whim. South of the Caledonian Company, the Red Hill Com pany have applied for a lease of 11 acres, and are en gaged working ; and next succeeding is the Main Royal, who have applied for a lease of 18 acres. This company have sunk through 60 feet of trap rock, and are, I believe, near the margin of the gutter. Be/ond this the Grand Reliance Pr-specting Company are abjutto commence operations on an expensive scale, and will in a few months solve the problem of the supposed richness of the ground at this point, where a junction with the leads proceeding from Browne's is supposed to take place with those trending from Smythe's. We now come to that part of the district known as Browne's, of which I have already given a brief gene ral description. From the explorations made in this section of the gold-field the main channel would appear to be that called the Contest Lead. This lead takes its rise between two ranges, on the north eastern side of the flat, and will probably join the North Briton at point X on plan. Tho Contest is joined by Browne's Old Lead, at a distance of about 700 yards from its source. It was proclaimed on the frontage system on the 5th Novem ber, 1857, and 24 claims were registered on it. These claims were subsequently abandoned, in consequence of the unsuccessful attempt of two or three parties to prove the gutter. The lead was then, after a short interval, taken up by different parties as abandoned ground claims, whereby the extent of the original claims were quadrupled. The encouragement afforded by such enlargement led to the revival of the lead ; and registration was again resumed to theifurther extent of 32 claims \u2014 only 19 of these proceeded to work ; and the result of their labors has since shown us that the lead is getting con siderably poorer as it proceeds. Beyond No. 19 an abandoned ground claim of 975 feet long had been given up to the Enterprize Co., in June, 1858, and it has been lately out, leaving only \u00a363 per man, as the proceed? of 12 months' labor. Beyond the last-mentioned claim, the Contest has not been traced continually, but, as before stated, it probably joins with the North Britain lead at point B in the Great Britain claim. From its source, for a distance of 350 yards, the lead was very rich and narrow, from thence it began to widen out until near the junction with Browne's Old Lead, at No. 12 it spread into an undulating flat of 200 feet ; and a cor responding depreciation in the quality of the wash dirt became here observable. Also, previous to this j unction, it was remarkable for the quantity of ferruginous concrete which it contained, and which almost entirely disappeared beyond the point of junc tion. The North Briton Lead takes its rise in the southern base of Watson's Hill. It was discovered in Novem ber last, and 9 claims registered on it. The depth of sinking is about 150 feet, and the width of the lead is about 50 feet. The thickness of the wash-dirt is from 1 to 4 feet. As the lead runs to tho westward, the yield, which is about 1 ounce to the load, does not show any falling off, as in the case of those already described. This may be attributed to the two tribu taries which fall into it \u2014 viz.. Barber's Lead, in the North Briton Company's lease, and the Morning Star Tead, in the last registered claim No. 10. Barber's Lead is divided into block claims. Its depth is about 100 feet, and it has been found tolerably pro ductive. Tiie Morning Star is an inconsiderable tributary of very limited extent, proceeding, it is sup posed, from the hard surfacing hill overhanging Barber's Lead. There were 18 claims registered on it on the frontage system last month, but only one or two companies have proceeded to work. B"], [32, "10 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. The North Briton, as may be seen by reference to the plan, is partly on the block and partly on tho frontage system. That portion held under the frontage system is worked from four shafts, on each of which a steam-engine is erected. The lead pays well \u2014 a circumstance which may be attributed in some degree to the well-ordered arrangements of the dif- ferent companies. Beyond the Great Britain lease of 33 acres, is the Grand Junction of 29J acres. This company have bottomed at a depth of about 180 feet. The first rock met with in Browne's district is in the shaft. It makes its appearance in a thin seam, loosely aggregated. Next to the Grand Junction is the Hand-in-Hand Lease of 32\u00a3 acres. This company have bottomed, on the north-westerly reef, nearly 100 feet above the level of the gutter, and are now driving through the schis- tose slate to meet the gutter. This brings the report to that point where it was left off in the description of Smythesdale. The shallow workings which have been shown on the plan were all very rich, but have been long exhausted. As will be seen by reference to the map, they are al- most entirely in the hands of the Chinese, who are en- gaged in paddling operations, and by their close and diligent attention to business, together with their systematic mode of working, they obtain very good returns. I find the Chinese of this district a very orderly people, and their conduct well worthy of i mitation. on the banks of Yankee Gully are making good wages, but until new ground is opened, the alluvial miners will not, on the whole, bo repaid for labor expended. QUARTZ MINING.\u2014 MOUNT BLACKWOOD. There is a great variety of reefs in the district In i he deep leads the rock is in most cases a greenish schistose slate, the cleavage being north-east aud south-west, and the angle of the dip towards the south west. In the shallow sinkings, red, white, brown, and yellow reefs are met with, and in some ca=es patches of beautifully-variegated sandstone is found above tbe auriferous grouud. It is nearly as compact as the original rock ; but there is considerable difference in the density. The particles of which it is composed are of tho finest description, evidently proving their de position in tranquil waters. I send you specimens of each, with a description of their position. Some interesting minerals are met with in the basal tic rock, especially acicular arragonite, botryoidal and mammilated acty.olite, and carbonates of lime ; in some rare cases, hyalite, with carbonate of iron. There is a vast number of quartz veins in the district, only two of which have bean worked, one of which is situated near Brown's, the other at Smythe's, but both have been abandoned in consequence of the poor yields of gold. The minerals found in the veins of quartz are iron pyrites, arsenical pyrites, sulphuret of antimony, sulphuret of lead, carbonate of copper, &c. These minerals are found in very small quantities. The supposed course of the ancient river-bed of Smythesdale is oniy shown in pencil line for the pre sent. Its position will be better ascertained next month, as there are numbers now working on it. Blackwood Division. (C. B. Longbottom, Mining Surveyor.) Population.\u2014 Thu estimated population is as fol lows : \u2014 170 engaged in quartz mining. 450 engaged in alluvial mining ; and 250 Chinese engaged in alluvial mining. Total, 870 persons engaged in mining. I have arrived at the number engaged in quartz mining through reports given to me by the different companie*. The number engaged in alluvial mining I have estimated from my own observations or the ar rival and departure of miners. Alluvial Mining.\u2014 The alluvial mining since my last report has been very dull, and nothing of impor tance has come under my observation. The yield ob tained by sluicing is, this year, far below the average of former years. This is to be accounted for in the present season bj the decrease in the population, no new sluicing ground being opened, and the best ground having been formerly worked.

From the annexed table, it will be seen that parties are raising and crushing quartz, which does not average more than one-halt ounce per ton, with which they are very well satisfied. One of the finest (but small) machines in the co lony has been lately erected by Messrs. Martin and Smith, for the Golden Point Company, on Jonstou's Reef. This machine is on the principle of Mr. Ste vens's of Bendigo, but improved, the lifters being turned, and work in anti-friction metal guides, with malleable iron disks aud cams, and both disks and cams are faced with steel. The whole machinery is fitted up in a most substantial and workmanlike manner, and reflects great credit on the contractors. After the quartz leaves the stamps it passes over an improved ripple-box, containing quicksilver ; it then passes through a cast-iron amalgamator, also contain ing quicksilver, and the whole of the debris and water passes through quicksilver three times before it can escape, and should any gold pass through the ripple table it must be collected in the amalgamator. A similar amalgamator has been formerly used by Messrs. Martin and Smith, and the one at present in use is on an improved principle. The generally used stamper wears considerably at the back ofthestimper-head,requiringtobetakenoutof its box and turned eveiy week, in order that it may wear more even ; but, with the utmost diligence, it cannot be made to wear even, which naturally impedes the process of crushing. This is supposed, to be entirely obviated by using the revolving stamper, and there is no necessity to remove it until worn out. This machine has cost more in constructing than one made with the generally used straight-lifted stampers, but a great saving is supposed to be ultimately made both in labor and capital, and the machine is expected to crush one half more than an ordinary one. I am at present employed in executing a drawing of the above machine, but having been called to Mel bourne on business, was detained too long to enable me to finish it in time to forward it with this report. The rush to Ciowe3's Forest has thinned tbe mining population latterly, but the fever occasioned by this rush has subsided, and the population is remaining stationary. BEECHWORTH MINING DISTRICT. \"\"prins Creek Division. (Henry Grimes, Mining Surveyor.) The population at Spring Creek, Three-Mile, and Woolshed is 7,700, and at the township of Beechworth 3,100\u2014 total, 10,800. During the past month the population has been slightly decreasing. The Indigo, New Ballaarat, and towards the Buckiand have been the destination of the majority. The diggers have been at work steadily, and they have had an abundant supply of water, and few wet days, and there has been little interruption to the works being proceeded with. There is an important subject to which I would beg to call the attention of the Board. It is in reference to the boundaries between bed and bank claims, on ground which has already been worked. A warden is called upon to strike the boundary of the bed of the creek. In the course of two or three years, perhaps, the warden has left the district ; the claims have changed owners more than once ; a dis pute arises between the bed and bank claims ; the warden is called in, and, having no marks to go by, or only disputed marks, as to how the former boundary was situated, he strikes a fresh oue, thereby creating endless confusion and litigation. I am at present engaged in such a case. The costs of the first suit have been about \u00a350, and an appeal has been made to enable the appellants to summon the warden who first struck the boundary. Many more cases would be brought before the Court of Mines if the ex pense were not so great, and the chance of getting a right verdict so doubtful, in consequence of the wit nesses and jury not understanding the plans that are produced, the witnesses trusting to their memory of the situation of a boundary by the surrounding lie of the ground, when, perhaps, all the former marks have been obliterated, &c. To obviate these disputes as much as possible, and save the miners those heavy expenses to neer*1 their rights, I would beg to recommend that a \u00abu^eyor should be permanently appointed to a district, whose duty it would be to lay down accurately all extended claims, frontage claims, and any o.hers that might require a lengthened period to be worked ; so that in case the boundaries were lost or wilfully altered, they could be readily found again. The surveyor, having his whole time devoted to these matters, would be enabled to supply all the informaLion that would be required by the Board. And 1 would also recommend that he bhould have the power to settle the uisputes between the miners upon the ground, as I think that the decision of a professional man wuiildbe much more satisfactory to the miners generally. (c) Have not commenced crushing. (d) Have a reef from 15 to 16 feet wide, but do not find it good. Strike leaders from 5 to 10 feet wide (variable) on each side of the reef, more remunerative than the reef ; use shaking tables. (e) At a depth of 40 feet the reef in this claim is about 50 feet wide, intersected with sandstone. Have been working a part of the reef, averaging a width of 8 feet, and crusned 6 feet of it; could not ascertain the yield, but it is paying. if) Crushing the refuse quartz thrown out of the claims, and left as not payable, three to four years ago, with good success ; but the average yield I could not ascertain ; use shaking tables. (g) Have been crushing quartz, but have let their machine to the Crown Company. ih) Recently commenced, and not fully employed crushing. (i) This reef was abandoned about three years ago ; applied for a lease of abandoned portion of the reef ; estimated to yield 1 oz. per ton ; intend crush ing with the machine of Hudson and Candage.

(k) Are at present erecting the machine, and ex pect to be in lull work in one week ; quartz looking well. Snake Valley Division. (Thomas G. Kennan, Mining Surveyor.)

The general condition of this portion of the Ovens gold-fields is, on the whole, prosperous. Sluicing being almost the sole means used iu this district for extracting the gold from the soil, a plen tiful supply of water is indispensable, and small streams are almost wholly useless. The large amount of rain which has lately fallen had caused the race owners to be fully employed. The European popula ion in this division is mostly a settled one, having comfortable homes and garueus. It consists chiefly of raceowners, who, when (as tit present) woll supplied"], [34, "12 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. New Ballaarat Main Lead.\u2014 At the upper part of this lead it is, in some claims, paying well, averaging 2^oz. to the load, and there arc 2 feet 6 inches of wash-dirt ; and again, in othirs.it only averages 15 dwt. to tho load, though still, from the thickness of the waahdirt, it is averaging good wages. The lower part, or Wet Lead, as it is called, is now being taken up, and very soon will be in full work. Three engines are now upon the ground, of the power of 12, 8, and 7 horses, re spectively. They will soon be at work, raising water and wash-dirt. I also hear of three others ordered, which are expected soon to bo upon the ground. Suf folk Lead is considered, so far, the richest lead of tha district. It, also, is very patchy\u2014 some claims having 6 feet of wash-dirt, and others again only 6 inches. It will average from 1 oz. to 3 oz. to the load throughout. Clvdeside Lead, which I reported in my last as having struck payable gold, is given up for the present, as the parties found in driving that it did not fulfil their| expectations ; and, being out of funds, have given it up for the present ; but they state that next Spring they will again try it, for it is the opinion that a good lead will be found there. One of the two prospecting parties struck payable gold on the Skeleton Creek, on the 22nd June. It is called Reefers' Lead. It is situate about H miles to the south of Chiltern. Tho sinking is 140 feet in depth, and the wash-dirt about 15 inches in thickness. I got from 1\u00a3 oil-cans 2 dwt. of gold. The width of the lead is not yet defined. I have not yet got the section ; but it is principally a red clay, with thin layers of sand and gravel. The bottom is a pipeclay and sandstone rock. Quartz-Reefs. \u2014 During the past month nothing has been done in further proving the old leaders. I hear of several other leaders having been fuund. From inquiries made at the crushing-machines, I find that Gitchell and Chalmers's machine has not been more than half-employed, and has averaged from 1 oz. to l^oz. Their machine is Stephenson's patent, with ripple-boxes, shaking -tables, and 16 revolving stampers, and is driven by an 18-horse-power engine. It is capable of crushing about 150 tons per week. The other machine \u2014 Lounie and Cameron's \u2014 is capable of crushing about 70 tons per week. It is a seven-horse power engine, with eight stampers, shaking-tables, &c. They have been constantly employed, and the quartz has averaged about 2 oz. to the ton. with water, employ more or less hands, according to the quantity of water they may be entitled to use. The Leviathan Company, mentioned in my former report, arc, considering the small number of working partners, \\iz., eight, progressing rapidly, having finished the open casting (over 120 yards at each end), laid the tramway for the trucks, and commenced tun nelling. They timber as they go on. They have a great deal of water to contend with at the end nearest the Nine-Mile, and they expect to get a large supply, independently of that which they expect from the surface springs, by the time they get through. It is contemplated by them to put the tunnel through with out any shaft a distance of half a mile each way. The lower portion of Europa Gully (No. 3 on general plan) is, I may say, completely worked out. A party (Messrs. Adams and Co.) commenced operations at its junction with the Nine-Mile, and washed everything before them, fr>m bank to bank, carrying a tail-race up with them as the work advanced. They have now a tiil-race of more than 400 yards in length, through which they run everything, and I am informed that, although the work is highly remunerative, but a very trifling amount of gold finds its way down the tail-race, as far as its junction with the Nine-Mile Creek. This is, without exception, the best worked sluice as yet in operation in the dis trict. Next month I will forward a plan and section of the lower portion of this gully, so as to include what has been worked and the claim this party now occupy. Further up this gully, another party (Messrs. Dillon and Co.) are setting in, on old worked ground, on a large scale, differing in this from Messrs. Adams's works \u2014 ihat they purpose bringing the hydraulic sys tem into operation, but they have not\" as yet com menced washing. The other gullies marked on the plan are all more or less occupied by sluicers, the dry diggers having worked them out, as they considered, long since. Among the richest were Nuggetty Gully (No. 4 on plan), so called from the coarse nature of the gold got there, and Long Dick's Gully (No. 8 on plan). Portions of the latter have been worked six times over, and, from what I can learn, will yet pay to sluice again. In fact, there is no part of this division that, with a good supply of water, would not prove remune rative to re-work. The population of the division is 3,000. of which the number of Europeans is 1,700, and Chinamen 1,300. Of these 1,400 Europeans and 1,150 Chinamen arc actually engaged in alluvial mining. The machinery consists of three puddling-mills at work, and one idle. Note.\u2014 The number of machines is from personal observation, the population from police returns. I estimate 300 Europeans, as consisting of women, Children, and persons not engaged in mining, as store keepers, and 150 Chinamen as engaged as store keepers or in other than mining pursuits. There are no q lartz-claims in operation in this division. Indigo Division. (Thomas E. Thornely, Mining Surveyor.) The approximate number of miners at work is \u25a04,371. Of these 4,171 are engaged in alluvial sinking and prospecting, 50 in quartz crushing, and 150 in quartz-mining. The total population is estimated at 5,052, of which number \u25a0_',000 are Chinese. The total population is taken from the police returns. SANDHURST MINING DISTRICT. Sandhurst Division. (G. W. Hart, Mining Surveyor.) As nothing of importance has taken place within the last month, with the exception of the opening up of one or two reefs, I have the honor to forward to the Board of Science a description and plan of the alluvial gold workings at Lower Huntly. It is well known that these workings are situate about four miles north of Sandhurst, aud have been the scene of a new rush within the last few months, running through private property, in the direction shown on the plan\u2014 namely, north-east and south-west. It was for some time ex pected to continue in the same course, as a few shafts sunk within the boundaries of a plantation of vines will show. It appears now to take a bend more directly south, towards the creek, which has been crossed, and some work done on its western side, on Government land. It is supposed that a connecting lead exists between the workings iu a northerly direction from Ironstone Hill, and the head of the Huntly woikings, just mentioned. The miners on either lead are actively engaged in working their way to each other. The depth of sinking about the creek is about 80 or 90 feet, and in wet ground ; but on the Eastern bank, although at the same depth, the workings are comparatively dry. I have made an ex amination of the line from the point where it crosses the creek to its point of contact with the' Murray road, where the ground is worked out and abandoned. A slight reaction has taken place at the lower end of the Indigo Main Lead, owing to the fact that several holes have bottomed on the lead. The depth of sinking is now about 200 feet.andfree from water, with the ex ception of the surface drains, which cause them to slab for about 15 feet, and puddle at the back. The prospects obtained are very uncertain. I have heard of 2 dwt. to the dish ; and again, in the adjoining claim, of only a few grains : it is very patchy, and there are from 4 to 10 inches of wash-dirt, which will average from 15 dwt. to 1\u00a3 oz. to the cart-load. The old claims, for about two-thirds down, are being taken up and worked by the Chinese."], [35, "MINING SUEVEYOES' EEPOETS. 13 I found that the depth of sinking increased very rapidly from the south-east towards the north-west\u2014 that is, across the lead, the whole breadth of which vanes between 300 feet and 400 feet. The whole of the material sunk through consists of a series of layers of sand, coarse and fine gravel, principally quartz, clay, and quartz conglomerate ; the latter usually very thin, varying in thickness between six inches and one inch, and sometimes missing altogether. The wash dirt, composed of quartz, gravel, clay, and rand, varies also in thickness, being towards the centre of the lead about 5 feet deep, and at the side 1 inch, or even less. It rests upon a bed of clay slate, termed the *' bottom\" by the miners. Being easily worked, it is the usual practice to drive into this stratum, leaving the gold-bearing drift above, which is thus more efficiently got out than it would be by driving intot he looser layers above it, besides bemg less dangerous to the miner. Waranga Division. (F. M. Hill, Mining Surveyor.) Whroo, or the Wet Diggings, Goulburn.\u2014 This gold-field, situated about 55 miles north-east from Sandhurst, was first opened during the latter part of the year 1833, as alluvial diggings. Several gullies were then opened, and found payable, but the field was gradually deserted, although a small number of miners have always remained. The principal gullies braneh from the dividing range between the \" water-sheds\" of the Goulburn and Campaspe rivers. Population. \u2014 The miners at present working in this part of the district may be described as of a mixed character\u2014 quartz, puddling, and alluvial mining being pretty equally followed. The population may be described generally as settled, .those working there being principally old residents, and in many instances occupying comfortable and permanent residences. The approximate number of miners engaged is about 200, of whom about SO are quartz-miners, and the remainder about equally divided between puddling and alluvial mining. Machinery. \u2014 There are at present two steam crushing-machines at work in this locality, both of which appear to be actively engaged. There are about 30 puddling mills on the field, about one half of which only are working, employing on an average about four men to each machine. At about 40 feet from the surface we find what is usually called the '* false bottom\"\u2014 a stratum of hardened grey mud, very insoluble. This layer is about 12 feet thick. As the miners are averse to stopping their work for the length of time that would be required to make an accurate inspection of the various shafts, it is only by comparing the statements of the most intelligent that the truth can be arrived at ; and the result of my nu merous inquiries is that the same number of strata is not to be found in any two holes, even though conti guous to one another ; that the thickness of the layers varies greatly, and that two distinct strata, which in one shaft are found separated by a different material, are in the adjoining shaft found resting one on the other, the intervening stratum being wanting. The water in this locality is plentiful, and is not entirely dried up in summer. There are several lagoons within a short distance of the workings, one of which I have shown on the plan. A few dams have also been con structed for the purpose of collecting the winter rains, so that very little is. allowed to run to waste. The usual method of separating the gold from the washing stuff is, first by puddling it, aud afterwards crushing the residue (tailings), from which the remaining gold is extracted by amalgamation. As far as I can ascer tain, the population at Lower Huntly is about 500. There are several stores and two licensed publichouses established in the neighborhood. Alluvial Mining.\u2014 In alluvial mining and puddling little or no advance has been made on the rude me thod of extracting the gold generally adopted through out the district. Quartz Mining. \u2014 Quartz-reefs in this locality are beginning to attract attention ; but, at present, only four mines are being worked, viz. \u2014 the Balaclava, Albert, Victoria, and Black Reefs. The Balaclava Reef, which is the only one I have had an opportunity of inspecting, is the principal one being worked, and on it is situated the now celebrated claim of Mr. Lewis, from which a large quantity of gold has already been obtained. The shaft is sunk on the crown of the hill, which is, I believe, tke highest point on the ranges for many miles round. This claim is sunk to a depth of about 270 feet, and gold has been obtained through out nearly the whole of that depth. Breaks occur in this vein, and the place of the quartz is taken by a mass of antimony and conglomerate, frequently containing gold, specimens of which, obtained at a depth of about 200 feet, I have the honor to forward to you. The bearing of this reef, as laid down by Mr. Surveyor Nicolas, and agreed upon by the claimholders about two years ago, is north 26 degrees east, having a slight westerly underlie, and cutting the bed-rock nearly at right angles. In connection with this reef I may mention that Messrs. Lamb and Co., having purchased several claims south of their own on this line, have applied for a mining lease of the ground occupied by them, and intend erecting such macliinery as will tend greatly to develope the resources of this locality. Gold has been obtained on the other reefs mentioned, and it is surmised that the Albert Reef, which has an easterly and westerly bearing, will, at no very great distance from the present workings, form a junction with the Balaclava line. General Remarks.\u2014 One great peculiarity in this portion of the district may be mentioned in juxta position with the parts of the Sandhurst district with which I am more intimately acquainted\u2014 viz., the fact of the bed-rock running easterly and westerly, whereas that immediately surrounding Sandhurst runs invariably slightly to the west of north. I also observed, in this district, that the quartz veins occa sionally cut the bed-rock almost at right angles\u2014 a circumstance that renders the extraction of the precious metal from the auriferous quartz a matter of greater expense aud trouble than it otherwise would be, owing to the extreme tenacity with which the sandstone clings to the quartz, rendering the process of cleaning necessary. Although a depth of more than 250 sect has been attained, quartz mining opera- A method of extracting whatever small quantity of gold may j et remain on the surface among the older and now deserted workings has lately come under my notice. A few persons that 1 have met with derive a profitable return from collecting the old dried sludge formerly run oft' from the tub and cradle, then thought worthless. The practice is to subject it anew to the process, causing it, at the same time, to pass over coarse cloths rubbed with quicksilver, from which it is afterwards extracted in the usual way. It appears that b> this means the last panicle of metal is withdrawn, and the gold thus recovered can scarcely be calleu dust \u2014 it is the finest powder. A new surface reef, bearing the name of British Reef, has lately been opened \u2014 its northern end is at Sawyer's Gully, and its southern termination near the White Hills Cemetery. Its length is about three quarters of a miie. The greater part is now marked out into claims, and some shafts have been com menced, one of which has reached the depth ot 30 feet. This reef is easily traceable, cropping out in many places, and its average bearing is N. 26 degrees W. A few specimens of gold-bearing* quartz were shown to me, and I was informed that the small quan tity that has been crushed produced from 5 to 15 dwt. to the ton.

J"], [36, "MINING SURVEYORS* REPORTS. 14 plan and sections of Spring Flat, and Donkey, Paddy's Shallow, Scotchman's, and Nuggety Gullies.) Speaking of those gullies, he Bays:\u2014 The bed-rock is principally slate and schist, intermixed occasionally with hard sandstone dykes, at several places on tho main lead. The strata vary very considerably in a \u2022hort distance (see sections 12 and 13), where at a depth of 12 feet in No. 12 shaft a stratum of white gravel is found, whereas at the same level in shaft No. 13, there is a conglomerate overlying a stratum of brown gravel. At shaft No. 14, Yellow Lead, there is a sudden ai d deep fall of about 15 feet in the bed-rock, at which place the wash-dirt for several feet in thick ness was very rich. In claim No. 16 there is a stratum of cement underlying the clay, and a thin stratum of the same immediately upon the schist formation, a small piece of which taken from the same claim con taining a little gold I beg to transmit to the Board. In many other parts of the lead this conglomerate, if found near the bottom, has yielded as much as one pound weight of gold to the ton, and in the absence of efficient crushing machinery. At the time this lead was worked, many hundreds of tons of this metal (?) were never brought to the surface. The lead from shaft No. 15 appears gradually to deepen, from the deepest portion which my plan indicates to 100 feet, where the quantity of water struck at that level has hitherto prevented individual labor, and even six and eight horse power steam machinery (which has been used here) has been ineffectual in working the same re muneratively. From the lowest claim worked, 701b. weight of gold was taken, and at present in several of those shallow old workings described on the plan to the east of the Main Lead nuggets, varying in weight from 5 to 40oz., have recently been obtained. Quartz-reef No. 1, called the Township Reef, is situate at a point 75 chains, and bearing S. 80 deg. W., from the south-west angle of Millgate's suburban allotment. No. 1 pros pectors' shaft is sunk to a depth of 40 feet. A small leader, 10 inches thick, has been struck at a depth of 18 feet from the surface, and although con taining a little gold in the casing, is not remunerative. They are sinking deeper, in hopes of striking a richer vein. No. 4 north has also struck a similar spur at about the same level. They are sinking deeper. In No. 5, the deepest shaft on the hill, they are driving west. They have crossed two small veins at that depth, neither of which contains any gold. All the veins on this reef incline to the east, at an angle of 20 degrees. Nos. 2 and 3 north, and 2, 3, and 4 south, have sunk their shafts further to the east than the others, consequently cannot expect to strike any vein at a less depth than 100 and 120 feet. Quartz-reef No. 2 is situate on the eastern range from the Main Lead, at a point 30 chains and bearing N. 84 degrees E. from the north-east angle of Mill gate's allotment. This reef is quite abandoned. Four or five shafts were sunk three years ago, to depths varying from 10 to 60 feet. I cannot now ascertain that any gold-bearing quartz has ever been struck. A large rush is likely to take place at the Amphi theatre and Mountain Hut diggings. The population now is from 6,000 to 7,000. Several nuggets from these diggings have been sold lately at Avoca, weigh ing from 5oz. to 15oz. I intend to proceed there immediately, and will give further and more detailed information, with a plan of the workings, in my next report. | Mr. English does not give tables of the popula tion and machinery, in accordance with tho instruc tions.] tions have not at present been impeded by the presence of water. In reference to quartz mining, I would remark that the method of hauling the quartz, in cages running on skids, as used at the works on Mr. Lewis's and other claims on Balaclava Reef, appears to me far safer, and better adapted to the working of deep quartz mines, than the usual modes adopted of hauling the quartz in other parts of the district. With the exception of the original workings in this district, but little seems to have been done in the way of prospecting the surrounding country, which, however, according to received ideas, appears to be one which would repay the exertions of tho persevering. MARYBOROUGH MINING DISTRICT. Maryborough Division. (D. O'Leary, Mining Surveyor.) At the time I furnished my last report strong hopes were entertained that this division would shortly boast of another monster rush, second only to that of Back Creek. Thousands congregated on the supposed new gold-field ; for days the roads had been throDged with carts and waggons. Back Creek and its adjacent flats and gullies lust for a time a few of their thousands, and even more remote gold-fields contributed largely to the new rush ; but it is to be regretted that the sanguine were in a few days destined to witness their thousands dwindle into scores. The Mount Glasgow rush a second time proved a failure. The locality of the rush is on the east side, and immediately at the base of Mount Glasgow. The sinking where gold has been found in the prospectors' claim, and in a few of the adjoining claims is 82 feet deep. The upper stratum, 30 feet, is composed of gravel and loam ; tbe next, 35 feet, sand and gravel ; and the third, 17 feet, red drift and gravel, reaching the wash-dirt, which is composed of clay and gravel. The bottom is pipe clay and sandstone. A gutter, 16 feet deep and 4 feet wide, has been discovered in the prospectors' claim, and traced to the next claim, in which the wash-dirt, 2 feet in depth, prospects at the rate of 2\u00a3oz. to the load. This favorable indication, and the fait that gold in payable quantities has been found in other claims, might probably cause a reaction. The present population does not exceed 100. Avoca Division. (R. English, Mining Surveyor.) [Mr. English forwards a plan of the Avoca Main Lead, and a plan of quartz-reefs, .Nos. 1 and 2, contiguous to the Main Lead, with vertical sections.] He says : \u2014 Avoca Main Lead commences at a point 1 chain N. 80 deg. W. from the south-west angle of Millgate's suburban allotment, situate on the third section of the main road from Avoca to Maryborough ; and stretches thence south-westerly to the junction of Spring Flat and Donkey Gully. It is quite apparent that this lead has received its deposits from various portions of the eastern ranges, and all its tributaries have been worked in that direction. Those ranges also abound in apparently gold-bearing quartz. De tached quartz rocKs may be observed cropping out on the hills in several places, intermixed with sandstone, slate, and schist. I am surprised that this part of the district has not received more attention, especially from those engaged in quartz mining. From the fact of those shallow alluvial workings having been very rich, and as there can be no doubt that quartz is the matrix of all such riches, it may be presumed that a rich quartz-reef will eventually be discovered in this immediate locality. A little further to the east \u2014 a sput which I am unable to show on my plan \u2014 is a very thick quartz-vein, which may be traced on the surface for 7 miles in length, cropping out on every hill in the line, the whole distance ; and only in one part can I see that any one has even pro spected it, and that not mure than to a depth of 4 or 5 feet from the surface.

No new ground of any consequence has been opened ; and with the exception of two steam-engines and five-horse whim companies, no parties of any magnitude are engaged in this branch. It is chiefly prosecuted in the old digging style of from two to four in a party. The majority of these have barely made a living, although many have made fair wages, and a few have done well. The two engine companies have been more fortunate than usual, and are now paying pretty well. Most ofthe puddling machines are at work, and water is plentiful, but many of them have nearly, or quite, worked out the payable ground in the localities in which they are erected, and the owners will soon have to turn their attention to other modes of work- ing. There can be no doubt that large quantities of gold have been, a nd are daily, carried off with the sludge from the machines, a great deal of which waste might be preveme d, by having a ripple-trough with a few pounds of mercury attached to the sluice. Sluicing has not, as yet, engaged the attention of the miners here, although the bed of the River Loddon appears to be a favorable place for that kind of work. From the junction with the Bet Bet to Newbridge the auriferous ranges sloping towards the river (m some places to its very bank) must have deposited vast quan- tities ofthe precious metal in its bed. Quartz-mining is steadily progressing. Four new reefs have been added to the resources of the division during the month, viz., Corfu, Barker's, Murphy's, and one on private property near the Loddon. Several claims on estabUshed reefs have struck gold. I annex a list of the payable reefs in work, showing the extent of remunerative ground and the yield per ton: \u2014 Sandy Creek.

The present mechanical appliances and registered privileges are as follows : \u2014 Employed in thc disintegra- tion of quartz, &c, 27 steam engines, of an aggregate of 312 horse-power, driving 220 head of stamps, 3 Chilian mills, and 51 shaking tables, pumps, &c. In addition to these there are eight crushing-machines worked by horses. In alluvial mining there are three steam-engines, of an aggregate of 38-horse power, employed by asso- ciated companies, who hold claims amounting to 12 acres 2 roods 32 perches. There are 438 puddling- machines, connected each with a dam, or other water privilege, and 185 pud- dlers' claims, amounting to 159 acres 2 roods 1 perch. Of these the Chinese now possess 123 machines, 95 of which were obtained by purchase from Europeans. They also hold 65 of the claims, amounting to 50 acres 38 perches. 10 tunnelling claims are held in this division, ave- raging 100 x 150 feet each. 36 extended claims, worked by tunnels. 33 sluices, and 3 extended sluicing claims. 24 creek claims, together 1,623 yards. 10 horse- whims, drawing from deep shafts, and 19 horse-pumps.

J In the stamping machinery for reducing quartz, ex perience proves the advantage, whenever practicable of substituting iron for wood, though more expensive feature since the dato of my last report. The average yield of gold seldom exceeds loz. to the load. Fig. 1 on tbe accompanying sections shows the nature and depth of sinking. The supply of water is abundant, and is derived from Wilson's Creek. Synnott's.\u2014 Nothing of interest has transpired dur- ing tho past niunth. The yield of gold per load is about the same as at Fenton's, and the supply of water is plentiful, the diggings being situated within a short distance of the River Avoca. [Reference is made to the sections.] M'Intyre's, or Wet Diggings.\u2014 No new giound has been opened within the last month. A few miners still continue their labors in the old ground, with but indifferent success. On Marshall's Reel the prospec- tors have amalgamated with the owners of the c_aim on the south side, and have arrived at a depth of 60 feet without discovering any reef. The claim adjoin- ing, on the north side, is likewise being worked. Water is found in sufficient quantities to supply the requirements of the miners in the old workings, and in M'Intyre's Creek. [Reference is made to the section. J Jericho.\u2014 Quartz-reefing, almost the sole pursuit of the miners on this gold-field, has not assumed any greater degree of activity than during last month. Several reports have been circulated as to the discovery of \" main \" reefs, which have alternately turned out to be without foundation, there being only veins, or leaders, varying in thickness from a few inches to 2 feet, and occasionally containing a small quantity of gold. The quartz-crushing machine has just com- menced operations, and next month I shall be in a position to report more fully upon the probable value of these reefs. A very small number of miners is engaged in washing pipeclay, tailings, &c. [Reference is made to the sections.] Jordan's. \u2014 Only two claims have as yet struck the auriferous quartz on Patterson's Reef. The yield of gold averages about 1 ounce per ton. Two other shafts are in course of being sunk. On Phillips's Reef the prospecting claim alone is at present in work. [Reference is made to the sections.] Kingower.\u2014 During the past month a rush has taken place at the head of New Chum Gully. The sinking does not exceed 2 or 3 feet, and is through red clay and gravel. The process of washing is seldom adopted, operations being chiefly confined to \" nuggeting.\" No estimate can be formed as to the yield of gold in ground of this nature, the nuggets being scattered at unequal distances and depths, and found both in tho gravel and pipe-clay. Several parties are said to have been doing very well, one individual having obtained 120 ounces. Patterson and Co.'s c'.aim on the reef ap- pears to be increasing in richness, and operations have been resumed in several claims on the north end of the reef.

[Reference is made to the sections.] Korong. \u2014 Most of the'miners in this gold-field are engaged in and on the outskirts of, the old workings. No new rush has taken place during the month. The population at the \" Scrub rush \" hasgreatly decreased. Not more than 80 miners are at present engaged on the quartz reefs, -Mid nothing worthy of note has taken place since my last report. The miners generally ap- pear to be of a steady settled character.

It is far more serviceable, in working it has less friction, and it saves much time and trouble. Vivian's (of Castlemaine) reversing stamp is evi dently an improvement on the common stamp ; the manner in which the lift strikes the cam greatly dimi nishes the leverage, and, consequently, the vibration usually observable in stamping-mills. The reverse semi-rotatory motion of the stamps, at each rise of the shafts, causes an equal wear of the heads, conse quently more speedy and regular disintegration of the quartz. My statistics show two steam-engines less than formerly employed in quartz-crushing. These were small and inefficient. They will be replaced by a 12-horse. power, now being erected by Opie and Co., Forest Creek ; and a beautiful engine of 40-horse power, and corresponding plant, being erected by tbe Specimen Gully Quartz Mining Association, Barker's Creek. Machinery, &c. \u2014 Improvements on the present ap pliances for abstracting the fine particles of gold from their matrix are very essential to the profitable prose cution of mining enterprise ; and it is well known that in the sludge from the common puddling-maehine a large proportion of the lighter particles of gold is mechanically suspended and carried awaj . Also, from the debris from the most efficient quartz-crushing machinery yet invented a considerable quantity of fine gold is obtainable. Much of the quartz gold is coated, or in contact, with foreign substances, which preventits uniting with the mercury, and, more over, it is so attenuated that the water prevents its uniting. Iu this division the shaking-table is principally used, but with the most regular oscillation it is found im perfect. Some of our machinists are substituting fixed inclines, with a great number of stops, so placed that each stop forms a ripple. The efficiency of this apparatus depends on the manner of subsi dence of the gold. It is a simple contrivance and re quires to be supplemented by some process of amal gamation which would save the particles otherwise lost. A new amalgamator has been invented by a Forest Creek machinist (Whittaker). It consists of a small portable cylinder, revolving in a larger one containing mercury. The matrix is passed through the quicksilver, and discharged upwards. This amal gamator is being experimented with, and I hope soon to record its efficiency. New Diggings.\u2014 The newly-discovered diggings near New&tead, now called Devon-hill Diggings, are being prospected for a considerable distance, in the course of the Loddon River. Although several shafts have been bottomed andabandoned, otherminers, by driving, discover the deposits. One trial washing yielded 4oz. 8$dwt. from four tubs ; a second since my last report, 6oz. 5dwt. from two loads ; and a third washed half an ounce from three tubs. Three new scenes of active mining operations have been opened during the past month \u2014 one at the back of the Camp, Castle maine, and two in Campbell's Creek. The sinking, as usual in this division, is from 6 to 15 feet in depth. One of these, in Poverty Gully, is a Chinaman's Rush, about 400 of whom are collected, and they are procuring a good quantity of gold from the alluvium near the underlying reef which crosses the gully ; others near Nuggety Reef are working among the sandstones which crop out on the surface, obtaining gold from found in the interstices. In each place a large area remains unprospected, and the suc cess already met with proves the often-expressed belief that very much of our unbroken ground would prove payable if it were properly tested. The Chinese are partial to pro*pecting, and most indefatigable in their labors from daybreak until dark\u2014 the puddlers usually \"washing off\" by candlelight. The gold purchasers state that the greater portion of alluvial gold is the product of Chinese labor. In every portion of the division, however secluded, if it has a puddle-hole, one or more Chinamen is there, rocking his cradle. Spurious Gold.\u2014 A large quantity of spurious gold is being manufactured and offered for sale in this district. Every imaginable artifice which Celestial ingenuity can devise is resorted to in the counterfeit- ing and disposal of adulterated metal\u2014 even clay, thickly coated with gold, has been offered, intermixed with the natural product ; but more generally alloys, made to resemble the coarser kinds of alluvial gold, are manufactured. The process of manufacture is that of dropping the melted alloy into water, through a fine wire sieve, and afterwards flattening it with a hammer or mortar; but this imitation was soon detected by the uniform appearance and color. Now, however, they imitate not only the coarser kinds, but the flaky gold, aud the finest granulated samples (very similar to \" Ovens\" gold) ; and to complete the counterfeit a process has been devised by which the spurious metal is treated with nitric acid, by which operation all the baser metal is dissolved from the surface, presenting an exterior of fine gold. \"When thus manufactured, it so closely resembles the natural production as almost to defy detection : the usual chemical tests fail to detect the imposition. An ex perienced buyer may suspect the appearance, but only assay, or ascertaining its specific gravity, could prove its value. The samples of adulterated, gold tested have been nearly of one quality (about 20 carats fine), thj natural production of the division being 23 to 23\u00a3 carats fine. The alloy used is copper. I am not aware that such an alloy has ever been found as a natural production of this country. Fryer's Creek Division. (Augustus Poeppel, Mining Surveyor.) Population. \u2014 From the various branches of mining followed in this division, and the vast area it com prises, in all parts of which mining operations aro being continually carried on, to a greater or less extent, as circumstances occur or admit, there is some difficulty in estimating the population ; and, again, I would remark, that the Chinese at times are in a far greater proportion than at others, and a rush occurring here, in one week the population may increase 1,000, and vice versa. Europeans, however, have an antipathy rather than a desire to migrate ; their dwellings are strongly and neatly erected, with studious care for their comfort, therefore it is not at all surprising that they evince so little disposition to abandon these for new rushes, when the chances are greatly against their proving of any permanency, or even importance.

Alluvial Mining. \u2014 Since my last report two or three rushes have occurred, none of which have proved of any great importance. For a long time parties have been prospecting the creek and gullies on the side of the Sawpit Gully-road, and when any of them obtain gold in payable quantity a rush occurs, but insuffi cient in number to prove at once the true value of the alluvium in the locality. The sinking and the gold is very similar to Nuggetty Creek, although the ranges at the latter place (distant about three-quarters of a mile) rise more precipitously, and the surface presents a very rugged appearance, which is not the case with the former. In Nuggetty Gully (embracing Little Nuggetty Gully, which runs into it) some few havo been doing well lately, which leads to its being occa sionally rushed ; but the gold generally lying in nug gets, soon leads to the ground becoming abandoned, unless by those who are fortunate enough to obtain one or more of them. No part of this divi sion is better adapted for puddling-machines, with one exception, apparently in surnioun table, the creek in many places is so very narrow. On either side large reefs project many feet, and preclude all possibility of making a serviceable road. At the head of Spring Gully some few have done well on short outside runs of gold. These, however, seldom run far ere they fall into the main leads. On the whole, ordinary alluvial mining is in a less prosperous state than hitherto. Machinery. Steam Machinery.

Ere my next report I shall endeavor and hope to obtain sufficient reliable information as to enable me to form a table showing the various and average yields from the different gullies, &c. QUARTZ MIXING. The following table shows the present condition of the reefs in this division, and the yield during the past month : \u2014 Sluicing. \u2014 The report which I have to make upon this mode of mining is most favorable. Many parties high up the Loddon are doing remarkably well, in several cases from \u00a37 to \u00a38 per man being* shares weekly. A party of five (Englishmen) have a claim on the banks of the Loddon, at the junction of Fryer's Creek, equal in areato half an acre, which they work by paddocking. Aftersinking through about 11 feet of black loamy soil, there is a stratum of red gravel and stones, intermixed with small quartz pebbles, and extending to the bottom (black slate) ; the whole of this (8 feet) is washed through sluices, the yield varying from \u00a3 an ounce to lh ounces to the load. One man can wash seven loads per day. The party have averaged \u00a316 per man per week for some time, and have every prospect of its continuing to pay equally well for a long period. A party of 18 (the majority being Chi nese) in an adjoining claim have also 8 feet of wash dirt of the same gravelly nature, although of a much brighter red color. This is yielding on an average lldwt. to the load, and the gold is pretty evenly distributed through the dirt. The ground is very wet, but with simple mechanical appliances is not difficult to work. Tunnelling.\u2014 This branch of mining is being prose cuted most vigorously, the number engaged therein gradually increasing. A great amount of labor, and time, too, is necessary, however, before any remunera tion is obtained, hard slate and sandstone having to be cut through, in some cases to a length of 1,200 feet, consequently some time must yet elapse best ire I can report upon the yields obtained from the various leads which are now being tunnelled into. On the Bald Hill 15 tunnels are being worked, and 7 abandoned\u2014 13 of the 15 are the property of Chinese. On Butchers' Hill 4 are in work ; on Kangaroo Hill are 7, 2 of which are registered, and 5 in work ; on Table and Guildford Hills are 15, 14 of which are being worked, and 1 is registered.

Nine applications have been made for amalgamated claims, making a total of 3,239 feet; 11 for the allowed number of feet of abandoned reefs, total 3,440 feet ; ground for machinery, 3 acres ; and sluicing claims on the Loddon, 1,500 feet. New rushes have occurred at Sandy Creek, on old abandoned ground in the neighborhood of Mr. M'Kcnsie's store, for about \\\\ miles in length, princi pally confined to the Cliinese, who swarm here in very considerable numbers, amounting nearly to 2,000 men. There are but few Europeans, but their number is being augmented daily. It was here that the 97oz. nugget was found. Another new rush is now taking place immediately north of the above-mentioned loca lity. It is situate about three miles south by west from Tarrengower, and north of Sandy Creek. The depth of sinking varies from 18, 20, 25, and 30 feet. About 3 feet from the surface is a kind of red clay, and from thence to the bottom it is red clay, mixed with quartz and ferruginous pebbles. In some places the wash-dirt is pipeclay, and in others a mixture of pipeclay and sandstone. The under lying rock is sandstone. The yield has averaged from klwt. to ldwt. to the tub. In some places 2oz. and 2\u00a3oz. have been obtained to the load, and there is a report that a party got as much as 3oz. to the basket ; but I could not certify to the truth of that. The population two days since was 200 ; but it has since fallen to 80. There is no water except surface water, or what can be collected from Sandy Creek. The neighborhood of Porcupine Flat is very busy with alluvial mining and puddling operations.

There is generally a most abundant supply of water. A dispute has occurred at Hill's Reef, on the Mount, which has been settled (pro tempore), and at Fentemais and Eagle Hawk Reef, which were decided together. is employed at the rate of 10s. Sluicing in the beds of the creeks is effectually stopped for the season. In quartz mining nothing of importance has occurred during the month of June. On most of the old dis covered reefs, one or two claims are being worked ; but although some are paying at the rate of loz. to 2oz. per ton, still the most of the claims are prospect ing. Great impulse would be given to quartz mining in general in the division if any of these prospectings be carried out successfully. Considerable advantage has been taken of the re cently-revised by-laws, more especially with refer ence to the quantity of ground on old abandoned reefs having a width of 200 feet on each side of the base-line. The various machines which have a full supply of water are in full operation, and likely to remain so for some considerable time, with only one exception, that of Messrs. Chrystall and Co., in Long Gully. That engine has only lately been purchased, and it will not be in full operation for a week. A new crushing-machine has been completed during the past month, and is at present in full operation. It is erected at the junction of Kidd's Gully with Spring Creek, and cannot fail greatly to facilitate quartz mining* in that locality. The Lisle's Reef Mining Association have an amal gamated claim of 600 feet, with the requisite area of ground for dam, storage, &c. An engine of 15-horse power has been purchased, and the boiler, weighing 9 tons, dragged to its resting-place on the Mount. In Yandoit, a reef discovered in Dr. Malcolm's paddock has yielded handsomely in the prospecting claim from the very surface. The shaft is at present 35 feet deep. Another new reef, the \" Donna Maria\" reef, recently opened on the Frenchman's Hill, I am informed shows a good prospect. A powerful steam engine, to be erected on Clement's Reef, where a quantity of payable stone has been raised, is at pre sent on the road from Ballaarat, and I doubt not that its erection will enable me to report favorably of the Yandoit reefs. The Porcupine Flat Mhiing Company are now en gaged in constructing a large dam opposite the Brighton Hotel, which is nearly completed. The various sluicing companies on the Loddon are much inconvenienced by water. Although at the present time plenty of water exists in this division for all purposes to which it can be ap plied, such will not be the case in the summer season. The means of obtaining a never-failing supply of water ought to engage the attention, not only ef the Govern ment but of other parties interested in quartz-mining aud machinery. Excellent facilities exist for storage in any quantity, even in the immediate neighborhood of this township, and at such an elevation as to permit of its being distributed in directions, north, south, and east, from the sources of supply to a distance of five to seven miles radius. An approximate estimate of such a scheme engaged my attention when the Maldon Municipal Council offered a premium for the best plan of supplying the town with water. I found that for a sum of \u00a33,000 a reservoir could be made capable of holding about 15,000,000 gallons of water. In alluvial sinking, or tub and cradle workings, nothing of moment has occurred in our old gullies within the past month. In Forty-Feet, Mr. Morri son's paddocks, the lower part of the lead is mostly taken up by parties still working their claims at the upper end, and I am' thus not in a position to report any progress. The sinking on the lowest claims bottomed has been through 10 feet of basalt rock, rather wet, and about 70 feet in total depth ; and the average yield, as far as I can learn, has been good wages \u2014 15s. to 11. per day. Of new ground opened I have to report one rush during the month. The scene is on the northern slope of a hill facing the Green Hill Creek, and situated 66 degrees S.W. of Yandoit and Frenchman's Hills. 1 have prepared a sketch illustrative of the formation of the hills, and the situation of the tunnel claims, and shall, by the time I get so far with my series of geological plans, he abie to forward more correct in formation than I am able to do at present. Hepburn Division. (Ambrose Johnson, Mining Surveyor.) The following table shows the population in the di vision : \u2014 The first holes bottomed (A on plan) were only shal low, and I am informed of one 27oz. nugget, and one 3\u00a3oz nugget, being discovered in about eight feet sinking; while the washdirt averaged from ldwt. to 5dwt. per tub ; but if a lead through these hills exists \u2014 and the trappean formation and other indications fully warrant such an assumption\u2014 these holes are, in my opinion, not bottomed on the proper level of the lead, judging- by the irregularity of the different strata sunk through. The formation outside the rock where gold has been found consists principally of a sandy reddish clay, intermixed with decom posed rock and fragmentary quartz and sand stone. The wash-dirt is more gravelly, and rests on a soft clay-slate bed. A number of claims are marked off towards the brow of the hill (B on the sketch) ; but I very much doubt their being bottomed, the intervening rocks not being quite such easy sinking as was anticipated. On the supposition that a regular lead exists, five different parties, num bering together 41 men, made applications according to the Mining Regulations for tunnel claims, and I have laid down the frontage \u2014 C to D, and the parallel lines E, as shown on the sketch. F represents th e tunnels going in about 120 feet below the crown of the hill, and G is a shaft bottomed at 38 feet, without obtaining any prospect. Europeans. Chinese. Total.

During the past month our surface hills and the banks along our creeks have presented a very busy appearance, and the plentiful supply of water has been fully appreciated by our puddling and sluicing population. From Shepherd's Flat, on the Jim Crow Creek, up to the heads of the different creeks, \u2014 Wombat Creek, Blind Creek, Stoney, Spring, and Sailor's creeks \u2014 races meet the eye on most of the ranges, flushed with water. Hill sluicing about Wombat seems to be in great favor with our miners, and I am informed they average about \u00a31 per man per day. Although most of the claims, besides incidental expenses, pay \u00a33 or \u00a34 per week for water to speculation race-owners, puddling and sluicing in general may be considered to average from 12s, upwards per day, while hired labor This is the first instance of new tunnel ground of any extent being opened since my appointment ; and I am confident that the laying down the frontage before the tunnels are started will prevent great litigation among the miners."], [44, "22 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. The gold is very fine, and it is obtained In a quartz grit above the washdirt, on waterworn quartz boul derB. The grit has also a portion of black sand mixed with it. Without black sand, or quartz-boulders, the gold is not iu payable quantities, but in almost every instance the color of gold can be obtained. Formerly, parties running adits into a bill assuming different frontages, very often intersected one another, and owing to the crookedness of the tunnels, it was in most instances impossible for the parties concerned to form anv idea whether they were working their own or their neighbors' ground, and hence arose innume rable disputes. Only two or three new tunnel-claims have been taken up in other parts of the district during tho month, but those through the reef are, I believe, paying very well. It is difficult to obtain anyreliable information on the subject, most of those engaged in tunnelling being Italians. But from the energy and perseverance wherewith this branch of mining is pro secuted by them, I infer that the average yield must be satisfactory. Hard Hill.\u2014 On this hill about 50 minersarc at work. The sinking is shallow, from 10 suet to 30 feet, with layers of cement from 6 inches to 12 inches in thick ness, and a layer of gravel between each course. The washdirt is quartz mixed with yellow gravel and the gold obtained is coarse and shotty. The Frenchman's Lead has also a thickness of cement from 12 inches to 18 inches, with quartz mixed in tho cement. The gold is coarse and nuggetty. About 150 miners arc at work. The substrata consist of sandstone, rotten slato, and pipeclay. Owing to the run of gold crossing the reef in au easterly and westerly direction (it is a question if it .should be called a run) the gold is found in patches. The most gold I have known to be washed is 3dwt. to the tub, but in tho majority of claims from gdwt. to ljdwt. 1 havo not heard of any large find of gold, but the diggers appear to have settled themselves, determined to give the distriet a fair trial. There is no doubt, as tho prospecting is continued, fresh leads of gold will be discovered, and the rush made permanent. The water, in the first instance, was derived from three tribu taries of the River Coliban, which will cease to run in summer ; but if /lams across the stream were made at the present time, a sufficient quantity of water might be obtained for all purposes. Water can bo obtained at the present time from abandoned shafts, &c. In order to obtain correct information in reference to machinery, population, &c , I have been obliged to viist the various gold working, all over my division, to form an estimate on the spot, and I am satisfied that the tables furnished are perfectly correct. It is a well known fact that a mining population easily increase*, and as easily decreases, a gieat number of single miners being constantly on the move ; but I believe with our present supply of water, and the prospect ot having sufficient for five or tix months, the number is most likely, at all events, to remain, if not to increase. A rush to Clow's Forest attracted, in the beginning of June, some parties from Jim Crow, but it seems that most of them are returning. The unpropitious state of the weather lately has prevented my finishing the survey to enable me to send in continuations of the geplogical maps and sections in time. I shall, however, as soon as possible, have the honor to forward them to you. St. Andrew's Division. Taradale Division. (James Murphy, Mining Surveyor.) [The following report is without a signature, but it is supposed to be from Mr. Mining Surveyor Shepard.] The following table shows the approximate number of miners in the division : \u2014 During the last month nothing of any importance has taken place m the vicinity of the township of Taradale, nor have I been called upon to make any survey's for the miners. The population at work mining consists, as nearly as I am able to ascertain, of about 300, one-half at work on quartz and for companies, and the remainder on alluvial workings. The Taradale Steam Gold Washing Company, occu pying tha partly abandoned alluvial ground, situate near the bridge, on the main road to Melbourne, have not sufficiently prospected the ground or are as yet fairly at work, although they have realised a good prospect at the present time ; and there is every rea son to believe it will afford a fair remuneration to the shareholders. The Ph\u0153nix Quartz-Crushing Company near the township us Taradale, have ceased working, preparatory to the erection of new machinery, but will resume work with as little delay as possible. There are five puddling-machines erected \u2014 three on Liberty Flat, one on Old Surface Hill, and one on Old Ironstone Hill. The sludge from these does not injure the workings. A new l-ush has taken place at Clow's Forest, and the population at the present time amounts to 500 or 600, and is scattered. The situation of these diggings is eight miles from Mount Blackwood, 13 miles from Kyneton, 15 miles from Malmesbury, and 10 from Daylesfurd ; and it is in the centre of forest scrub and heavy timber. Seven substantial stores are erected, and three are in course of erection. There is one building designed for a publichousc, and there are two slaughter-yards. The leading store, and the first erected, belongs to Mr. Clarke, who has taken much interest in the prospecting of these diggings. They promise to be of some magnitude. On entering the diggings from tbe direction of Kyne ton or Malmc-bury, you come to Splitters' Flat rush, where about 100 miners are at work. The sinking is shallow, from 5 feet to 20 feet, with aportion us surface. [Tlie tables of population given by Jlr. Jlurpliv show the number of miners in each gully ?,,..\u00a3 mcnts, &c.

The lode In question is about 4 inches thick, and the stuff was being thrown away as refuse when I visited that claim a few day's since When I informed the miners what it was, and its commercial value, they at once resolved to save it for the best and most convenient market. This ore is a rich sulphuret of antimony, with a thin film or coating of a yellowish white substance where it is in contact with the adjacent rock \u2014 probably an oxide of i he same metal. On the fourth hill, at Anderson's Creek, Mcssi s. Moore and Gerraghty are making preparations to commence their tunnelling operations from one of the adjacent gullies. I am informed that more ex tensive operations are delayed only until their lease is granted. On Growler's Reef, a claim of 320 feet has been taken up by Mr. Frazer, of Anderson's Creek, on which he has eight men employed for the purpose of prospecting, or rather of testing whether quartz working on a large scale will pay on that reef. At 70 sect deep, in the most southerly shaft, or that nearest the crown of tho hill, the vein is about 4 inches thick, and the working is in a tolerably soft argillaceous sandstone, with occasionally thin scams of very soft mica schist, from which I think I am safe in concluding that the vein will be found thicker at a greater depth. But even with 4 inches thick of quartz, Mr. Frazer says that 2oz. of gold per ton will pay well for tho working. Mr. Frazer has crushing machinery of his own within less than a mile and a half of the reef. As to the other reefs in this division, nothing worth noting has occurred during the past month. In alluvial mining, nothing worth reporting has taken place, except that the cutting of the canal at Thomp son's Bend has had to be discontinued in consequence of the floods in the Yarra. The men are, however, employed in prospecting the flat within the Bend, and from every shaft bottomed a fair prospect has been obtained of about Jdwt. to the tub, or a \\oz. to tho load, which will pay very well for sluice- washing, for which this ground is particularly suitable. The sink ing in this flat varies from about 12 to 16 feet near tho foot of the hills, and is in a sandy loam overlying about 4 feet of red drift gravel, containing gold. What is under this drift has not yet been ascertained, as tho holes cannot be easily bottomed, owing to the water caused by the floods in the river. In the shaft near the river, and on its immediate bank, the sinking is in from 6 to 8 feet of sandy loam, overlying from 1 to 2 feet of bluish black drift, which is the washing-stuff; and this rests upon slate rock, alternating with a hard greenish micaceous schist. Mining matters havo to some extent improved in this division, both as to the quantity of gold from quartz, and an increase in the number of quartz miners. There is a decrease in the number of those employed at the tub and cradle. In alluvial mining, also, there is some increase in the number of miners employed in puddling by machinery and sluicing, or in works tending to that end. This I regard as an im provement, even if there were a decrease in the total number of miners. At Whipstick Gully Dr. Owens has all his machinery and plant on the ground, preparatory to his working the claim taken up by him at that place. The ma chinery cons'sts of one of his patent puddling ma chines and a portable steam-engine of four or six horse power. I expect to be able to state the results from his machine in my next report. I have not been able to visit the Dandenong Gold field during the past month, but I have information from a reliable source that the whole of the popula tion of that locality is confined to one of the upper branches of Gerraghty's Creek, and docs not exceed 70 miners ; and also that even these are hardly able to make out a living, owing to the wetness of the place. The torrents of water which sweep along those creeks and guHes prevent their being worked otherwise than at intervals. In quartz mining I am glad to be able again to report another find of rich quartz at One Tree Hill, on the 30th ult., by Messrs. Hamilton and party, of claim No. 2 North on the Swedish Reef. Of this quartz 901b. weight when crushed yielded 144oz. of gold, or at the rate of 3,520oz. of gold per ton of quartz\u2014 a yield which, I believe, has been equalled but from few quartz reefs up to the present time. The depth at which this quartz was taken out is about 21 feet from the surface, and in 1 foot of sinking the patch of rich quartz is found to increase about 18 inches in length, and towards No. 3 North, where gold has been struck at 35 feet deep, and where it is expected that the quartz will be found fully as rich as it is in No. 2, with about 10 feet more of sinking. At No. 2 North, on heed's Reef, at the Yow- Yow, a rich lode of antimony has been discovered at a depth of 60 feet, of which I will forward a specimen, The branch gully where the people are at work is the same which in my report fur March I described aa having a deposit of boulders of quartz and drift, over lying and imbedded in a greenish white pipe-clay.

BALLAARAT MINING DISTRICT several leads, as shown on the table, is by no means extraordinary, though in particular instances compa nies have obtained very satisfactory returns, and to these particular instances of success I attribute the energy with which the leads generally are worked. No. 1 Division. (Robert Davidson, Mining Surveyor.) From elaborate tables prepared by Mr. Davidson, it appears that there are on the Inkermann Lead 722 Europeans and 12 Chinese employed ; there are 22 engines, of the aggregate of 338 horse-power ; there are 4 whims and 27 puddling-machines ; there are 10 horses employed. The cost of the plant on the ground is \u00a324,750, and the amount of gold raised during the month was 4,823oz. On the Haphazard Lead, 8 Europeans are employed, 1 puddling machine, lhorse; value of the plant, \u00a350; and amount of gold raised during the month, 48oz. On the Swamp Lead, there are 93 Europeans employed; there are 2 engines, of the aggregate of 22 horse-power ; value of the plant, \u00a31,350. On the Gravel-pits Lead, there are 90 Euro peans employed; there are 5 engines, of the aggregate of 49 horsepower ; there are 4 puddling-machines ; and the cost of the plant is \u00a34,900. The amount of gold raised during the month was 300oz. On Golden point Lead, 257 Europeans are employed ; there are 6 engines, of the aggregate of 173 horse-power ; there are 6 puddfing- machines ; the cost of the plant is \u00a314,300 ; and the amount of gold raised during the month was 31 loz. On Nightingale Lead, there are 72 Europeans employed ; there are 3 engines, of the aggregate of 51 horse jiower; there are 3 puddling-machines ; total cost of plant, \u00a33,000 ; and amount of gold raised during the month, 6S3oz. On Malakhoff Lead there are 124 Europeans em ployed ; 3 engines of the aggregate of 49-horse power, and 4 puddlmg- machines ; cost of plant, \u00a35,500 ; amount of gold raised during the month, 680oz. On Milkmaid's Lead there are 60 Europeans employed ; 1 engine, 16-horse power ; 1 whim, 4 puddling- machine a, and 2 horses; the cost of plant is \u00a32,700; and the amount of gold raised during the month was 515oz. On the Redan Lead, the total number of Europeans employed is 176 ; there are 3 engines of the aggregate of 70-horse power, and 2 puddling-machines ; the cost of plant is \u00a37,800, and the amount of gold raised during the month, l,150oz. On Campbell's Diggings and throughout the division, on sundry block, surfac ing, and old-ground claims, there are 280 Europeans employed ; the cost of the plant is \u00a31,200, and the amount of gold raised during the month 120oz. During the past month very little of importance has occurred beyond the ordinary workings of the several leads in this division. The aggregate yield of the I have endeavoured to obtain accurate information relative to the quantity of gold obtained by each com pany during the past month, but notwithstanding that I have spared neither money nor expense (having had a person engaged during the past three weeks hi collecting statistical information), I find in some in stances that it is quite impossible to procure it, some of the companies having directly refused to make known their returns. The table shows that the amount of gold obtained by 46 companies is 8,630 ounces, which, at the current price of gold on Ballaarat, gives \u00a334,520. The number of men engaged in working in these companies is 1,144, so that the average weekly rate of wages ob tained by the miners in this division, while actually engaged in raising gold, may be said to be \u00a37 Os. 10\u00a3d. \u2014against which the time and money spent in sinking and driving for the gutter or lead must be placed as an offset. Quartz Reefs. \u2014 Quartz mining begins to occupy attention in this division. One prospecting claim of 1,200 feet by 1,200 feet, has been taken up on the Milkmaid's Quartz Reef, and the company has com menced operatioDs. Very little work has been done on the Township Quartz Reef during the past month, in consequence of the miners thereon having been engaged in organising a company for the purpose of purchasing machinery for raising and crushing the quartz. I have every reason to believe that if the machinery be efficient, and the reef he properly worked, it will prove highly remunerative. I have the honour to report the existence of some auriferous ground known as Campbell's Diggings, represented on the accompanying plan. This locality is beginning to attract notice . There are at present about 130 miners at work upon it. In the ground first discovered the depth of sinking varied from 3 to 18 feet, but a shaft has recently been sunk to a depth of 45 feet. I have made a careful survey and examina tion of the locality, and from its general appearance, together with the wa.,er-worn appearance of the gold, I am of opinion that some good leads or gutters will be discovered in that neighbourhood. I also find on the range marked R in lications of a quartz-reef, which stands about south of the reef which is at present being worked at the Clunes, from which it may be"], [50, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 4 taken up by the present company. When the Eureka Lead was first worked, an opinion was pre valent amongst the miners that only the deep ground was remunerative, but experience has shown that this was erroneous, and several very rich deposits have been found in localities which would not have been presumed that it is an outcrop of the same reef. I have been informed that gold in small quantities was discovered in sinking post-holes for the fence marked A- B. . . ... [The remainder of the report is occupied with re marks on his surveys, &c] worked in former times. In fact, in my division the principal portion of the workings at present carried on are in the reef, as the known gutters have been worked sometime since. It may also be remarked that the miners are now content'with a smaller remuneration than they would have been in former times, when new and rich depo sits were being discovered almost every day. Added to this, much greater economy of labour is practised by the various parties, and thus stuff which formerly would not pay for working is now made to yield highly profitable returns. 1 The company of whose works 1 forward plans and sections present one instance of the great economy of labour which may be attained by attention to the details of mining operations, and the effect is, that many months' remunerative employment is found in localities which would not yield a sufficient quantity of gold under other circumstances to render it worth the miner's attention to continue work. I would call particular attention to the saving of labour which is made by the adoption of the system of reservoirs, as shown on the plan and section, and to the various labour-saving contrivances described below. No. 2 Division. (P. C. Fitzpatrick, Mining Surveyor.) Nothing of importance has transpired, nor has any new machinery been introduced. The total number of claims taken up is 13, seven of which were taken up under the Surfacing Regulations\u2014 four on old ground of an average depth of less than 50 feet, and the re maining two claims for quartz working, on the Black Hill. The introduction of crushing machinery on the Black Hill has been of the greatest advantage to the miners employed there, inasmuch as the tailings or refuse of the quartz, which were useless under the old system of crushing with the hammer and afterwards washing in a cradle, have been found to be highly re munerative when subjected to the stampers and amal gamators of the quartz mill, in some instances making a return of 15 dwt. per ton. Two other companies are now proposing to erect machinery on the north 6ide of the hill, and by so doing will save the miners on that side a lar^e amount of labour and expense in carriage alone. The Specimen Hill Reef is the only reef in the dis trict which was unworked last month, but through some cause, of which I am not cognisant (perhaps that the machinery was not properly erected), the company dissolved. The ground has, however, been taken up by 12 of the original company, and from the spirit of determination which they at present mani fest, I have no doubt they will prove, in a short time, Whether this reef is remunerative or not. [Mr. Fitzpatrick has not supplied tables relating to population, machinery, &$., aud plans and sections, *' in consequence of continued illness.\"] The claim is situate about one mile from the point at which the Eureka Lead takes it rise in shallow ground, and presents very nearly the same geological features as have characterised the whole length of the lead. On referring to the section, it will be seen that the depth of the bed-rock from the surface is 124 feet. ThiB depth contains the following strata : \u2014 Feet.

(Thomas Cowan, Mining Surveyor.) [From the tables prepared by Mr. Cowan, it appears that there are 1,037 Europeans engaged in alluvial mining, and 187 in quartz mining ; and 1,227 Chinese engaged in alluvial mining. There are 294 claims, and of these 2 are under lease ; 12 prospecting claims, 18 quartz claims, 147 on old ground, 19 block claims, and 97 are surfacing and paddocking claims. There are 18 engines, of the aggregate of 219-horse power, 23 steam puddling-machines, 2] 7 horse puddling machines, 81 whims, 69 windlasses, 3 quartz crushing-machines, and the number of stamps is 40.J Mr. Cowan says\u2014 It will be seen that no mate rial change has taken place since my last report, either in the number of miners or in the kind of em ployment in which they are engaged. Three large surfacing claims have been taken up during the month, but this fact does not make any great difference in the returns, as the greater number of the miners working in them were previously in like opera tions in ether paits of tbe division. The White Flat Company, a company consisting of 75 men, have worked out and abandoned their ground since my last communication, but the greater portion of the men employed in that company still remain withjn the division. The plans and sections forwarded are of the Edin burgh and Glasgow Company's works. The claim is situate on the well-known Eureka Lead, and consists principally of old or partially worked ground. The number of men in the party is 10, and the company is divided into 12 shares, two having been given si ee from work, on condition of certain plant being found by the holder. The area of ground held by the com pany is 100,000 superficial feet, or 500 feet by 200 feet. The drive marked A is the main drive put in by the company. Ibis drive goes along the course of the gutter or deep ground, but the operations on this part of the ground did not prove veryiemunerative, as the deepgiound had been worked before the claim was With respect to the depth of the vegetable soil, it is greater on this claim than is usually found, which arises from the surface of the claim being situate in a flat surrounded by sloping hills, from which the soil has been washed down. The yellow clay lying imme- diately below this is varied in character, though it is evidently one stratum. The predominant colour is a dingy yellow, but there are streaks of brown and other coloured clays intermixed. This stratum contains a large quantity of small pieces of quartz, irregularly deposited, having Bharp edges. The quartz found in deposits of clay of this kind is usually angular, and differs in this respect from the quartz found in the gutters. In some places bands of quartz were found lying at irregular intervals. The gravel underlying this clay was very compact, and partially cemented, apparently by the mixture of ferruginous substances. The predominant colour was a dull reddish brown. Below this gravel another deposit of clay was found, extiemely stiff, and containing no quartz. Imme- diately under this the drift was struck. The drift in this claim was composed of small pieces of quartz, with a very slight admixture of sand, and contained a large quantity of water. The black clay found below the drift was similar to that usually found over the deep ground in the Ballaarat district, and was of a compact greasy nature. Under this were the \" head- ings \u2014composed of a dark grey quartz-gravel, containing a small quantity of gold. In this claim large quartz boulders have been found on the high reef, whilst over the deep ground few or none were discovered. The washing-stuff in the deep"], [51, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 5 ground consists of quartz-gravel of a dull blackish grey colour, but high on the reef a stratum of a deep red ochre colour has been found, containing large boulders mixed with clay. This stratum has been found to contain gold in a -remunerative quantity. '\u25a0'As Mr. Wall, the original lead surveyor, still con tinues in charge of this lead, and the adjacent White horse Lead, 1 am not in a position to furnish such statistical information regarding them, or to vouch for the entire accuracy of such information as I can obtain ; still a brief history of the Frenchman's Lead, such as, under the circumstances, I can supply, may not be uninteresting. [The remainder of Mr. Cowan's report is occupied by elaborate descriptions of his plans and sections, which illustrate minutely the mode of working the claim above described ; and the descriptions would be unin telligible without constant reference to the plans and sections. He has also supplied a glossary of mining terms of great extent, arranged alphabetically.] It was proclaimed under the frontage system in the early part of 1856, and boasts of being the lead to which that system was first applied in Victoria. The average yield of gold obtained from the gutter has been at the rate of about \u00a350 per lineal foot, but owing to the extraordinary and unexpected expenses incurred after the lead crossed the Yarrowee Creek, and entered the table-land at the opposite side (see plan), as well as the very small extent of ground (3 min. 4 sec. per man) then allowed by the local court regulations, this yield (though under the present regulations it would pay very well) did not, for the first 27 claims, on an average, afford each shareholder more than from 12s. to lfis. per day, and I believe the remuneration from No. 27 to No. 66 (United Miners' Claim) did not average more than 9s. per day per man, all expenses having been in each case deducted. No. 4 Division. (Mr. O'Malley, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Alluvial miners, 2,000; quartz miners, 180. The total number of steam-engines at work is 20. The aggregate horse-power of these engines is 350 ; the total value, \u00a318,655 ; and the gross value of all mining plant is \u00a333,785. The total number of pud dling-machines at work is 27, of the aggregate value of \u00a31,445. During the month mining affairs generally in my district have undergone but little variation. The three deep rock leads \u2014 \"Frenchman's\" \"White Horse,\" and \" Cobbler's\" \u2014 still continue to be worked without any return to the miners, except in one in stance, on the Cobbler's, where the Long Funnel Com pany have for the last eight or nine months been get ting gold. Unfortunately, however, for this company, they were, it appears, induced, by counsel's advice soon afterthey had struck the precious metal, to insti tute legal proceedings against the company next ahead, with a view to compelling them to move onward so far as to afford the Long Tunnel Company, which had taken up tbe claim under the re j illations of 1856, space for a prospecting claim, such as is allowed by the present Minmg Board regulations. After the matter had been fully inquired into in the Warden's Court, and also in the Court of Mines, and an adverse decision pronounced in both as against the Long Fun nel Company, the company was still further induced by the legal adviser to make a final appeal to the Su preme Court, where they also were defeated, and mulcted in all costs ; so that, up to the present time, I am satisfied their net profits are very small indeed. As may be seen by the section, the United Miners* Claim is the last, and the most in advance that has been worked on the lead ; and though it was consi dered what was termed payable, it yielded from 24\u00ae linear feet of the gutter only the gross amount of \u00a310,800, which, divided amongst 72 shareholders, would give about \u00a3151 to each for 17 months' work, from which, deducting \u00a359 per man expenses, a net balance of \u00a392, or a rate of wages of about 4s. 4d. per day would remain for each. This company was the first on tbe lead, and, I believe, in the colony, that sank through the fourth layer of basaltic rock. They found therein (?) several trees standing in an upright position as when growing ; and though com pletely ene'.rcled with the once liquid lava, yet having the leaves and fibres in such a state of preservation as to be quite distinguishable. This claim is further remarkable for having been honoured by a visit from His Excellency Sir Henry Barkly, who, on the 20th January, 1858, descended the shaft (345 feet deep) and examined all the underground workings. Finally, it ia estimated that in round numbers the sum of \u00a320,000 has been lost m ill-con sidered outlay and speculation on this lead, inde pendently of the enormous loss of ill-directed labour, which has been estimated at \u00a330,000, assuming the current rate of wages in the district to be 10s. per diem. With regard to the four companies \u2014 \"Cumberland, Durham, and Cornish,\" \"Nelson,\" \"Working Miners,\" and \" Albion,\" still remaining on the Frenchman's Lead, though the three first-named have been in regular and unremitting occupation of their claims since April, 1856, and the latter since January, 1857, neither have yet been able to \" bottom\" their shafts ; nor is it likely, as may be seen from the ac- companying section, that they will see that accom- plished for some considerable time longer, as the water is so heavy in thai part of the \" third rock\" to which they have reached as to require the full power of a 40- horse engine to keep it baled, while the men are en- deavouring to bore a hole in the basaltic rock, and put down the powder, fuze, &e., which has almost invari ably to be done under more or less water. Judging, therefore, from the past, it is not likely that any of these four companies will reach the gutter before the year 1860, by which time three of them will have been continuously engaged for four years at the dishearten ing work of shaft-sinking ; and it is more than probabie that the fourth company\u2014 the \"Albion\" will be at least as long employed at the same kind of unremunera tive labour. After all, there i\u00bb not much reason to be lieve that the ultimate returns will be at all commen surate with, or proportionate to, the vast labour and outlay expended, unless, indeed, the yield of the gutter snould be much better in these claims than it has hitherto been. But such is the prestige of the * Frenchman's\" that the remnant of its old occupants still fancy or believe that, should they once be fortunate enough to reach its golden treasures, their fortunes The three mining localities, \" Whhn-holes,\"\"Paddy's Gully,\" and \"Italian Gully,\" though not exhibiting more than usual activity, have yet assumed a steadier aspect, particularly the latter, where two quartz crushing machines are in a forward state of progress ; the one a 15-horse power engine, which the \" Homeward Bound Company \" expect to have at work about the 1st September proximo ; the other a 25-horse power engine, got up by Mr. W. Porter, who expects to commence crushing on the 15th inst. It is only after these tests shall have been for some time (say a month) in operation that the prospects of the quartz miners in this locality will be ascertained, and that any valuable report on the sub ject can be made. The completion of these machines is anxiously looked forward to, and with good reason, for of the small quantities already crushed and washed for trial, the yield was highly satisfactory.

In the gullies dividing the ranges to the east of Smythe's Basin there are four prospecting claims at work, viz. \u2014 Montrose, Conqueror, Black Cock, and Uncle Ned. The former company have sunk to a depth of 85 feet, and in anticipation of a gutter being found and a lead proclaimed, a number of claims have been taken up. The other prospecting parties are in active opera tion, and indications already present themselves that their endeavours will add materially to our resources. The German Lead is in the sole possession of two parties (the Caledonian and Newcastle). They have been working for a considerable time back in the gutter, and have lately penetrated into each other's drives. They are now engaged in taking out then respective olocks. The Red Hill (leasing) Company have bottomed one shaft on the west reef of the trunk lead. They are now engaged in sinking % second one, and have pene trated through 60 feet of compact trap-rock, and will in all probability bottom on or near the gutter. The Mines Royal (leasing) Company have sunk 130 feet, and in consequence of an excess of water are obliged to desist further sinking in order to erect an engine of 16-horse power, together with other machinery. 8ince my last report of Smythesdale and Brown's, in district No. 6, I have, for the information of your honourable Board, to communicate that the whole of the claims on the Roxburgh Castle, Argyle, and Pioneer Leads have been amalgamated in accordance with the local mining regulations, and the several companies in occupation are prosecuting operations with great vigour. The prospecting claim on the Roxburgh Castle Lead gives dividends of from \u00a310 to \u00a312 per man weekly. The expenses are inconsiderable, no other machinery being required than a horse-whim and puddling machine. \u201e The auriferous drift in this claim varies from 1 to 2$ feet in thickuess, and the gold obtained is of a nuggetty description. The several companies to the north of the prospecting claim have been hitherto unsuccessful in meeting with the gutter, in consequence of a sudden deflection from its originally supposed course ; but as there aie several shafts now nearly bottomed, and in positions so ar ranged as must necessarily indicate its course, I hope to be able in my next report to communicate to you that its eccentricity has no longer succeeded in eluding the eager search of its pursuers. No-. 1, 2, 3, and 4 have reached the gutter, and its yield in these claims is about l\u00a3oz. to the load. The remainder of the claims southward have met with water in such quantities as to necessitate a temporary suspension of work, in order to erect whims and such other machinery as the requirements of the place ren der indispensable. On the Argyle Lead, as in the case of the Rox borough Castle, the prospecting party are obtaining good returns. So are the several companies thence up to seven and eight west ; and from the auriferous quality of the surfacing ranges abutting on this lead, on either side of its course, there is little dou bt of its proving a very productive one. The whole of the companies from seven and eight westward are in active operation, but in consequence of the large influx of water from the drifts, it will become, as in the case of the Roxborough Castle, ne cessary to erect machinery. This lead will, in all probability, join the Rox borough Castle and Pioneer Leads at or neir the point shown by me on the tracing forwarded last month to your Honourable Board. The Pioneer Lead is occupied by two amalgamated companies ; the first comprising three, and the other five claims. They are both actively engaged in sink ing their respective shafts, and expect to bottom in a few days, unless untoward difficulties retard their progress. The Reliance Prospecting Company, to the south ward, are expected to commence work at once, having, as I am informed, contracted for a powerful engine. On the north-east side of the Black Hill a disco very of a new lead has been made by a party of Chinese, and 10 block claims have been registered on it. The gutter is found at a depth of 90 feet, and 2ioz. to the cubic yard is the ascertained produce. The last two claims are on the trap-rock, where the sinking is likely to be 140 feet. The course of the gut* er is in the direction of the private property situate on the eastern margin of Smythe's Creek. On the South-western side of the Black Hill a run of auriferous ground has been found, at a depth of 45 feet, by [the Black Hawk Prospecting Company, and half-a-dozen block claims are busily engaged on it. The produce is Hoz. per cubic yard. The thickness of the wash-dirt is from 1 to 2 feet. The Oldham Lead, in the same neighbourhood, was discovered in October, 1858. The prospects obtained were very encouraging, and considerable expense has been incurred on the faith of its reputed worth, but I regret to say that it has not realised anything approachingtheexpectationa which had been then entertained of it. There are two engines still at work on the lead. The first company has rot yet touched the gutter; the other has been workingit fora considerable time back, but with pros pects fluctuating between mere subsistence and very inadequate wages. The Contest Lead (Brown's) is drawing to a close ; only one of the frontage claims is now at work. Its proceeds have been lately beneath moderation. On the North Britain Lead there is but little to add for the month. The several companies are realising excellent dividends. The Grand Junction Company (Lease), in advanced the Great Britain Company, are now opening a drive into the gutter: their prospects are very encou raging The next succeeding claim (the Hand-in- Hand) have opened a drive at a depth of 225 feet. thl V?ZV6\u00a3 ? yiet *2uched the \u00ab\"**\u00ab\u2022 -Next comes the Mines Royal, already describees fnJth?^re ?\u00a3 Deflr i.ncideilt3 to be\"related of Brown's for the month, with the exception of a prospecting claim to the west of the North Britain Lead, which ii expected to open a new lead TO3ou?riiSri^\\t0the 90uth-^t, are situated the Fakon &SE8\" J^?wn aS Monkey.

The Pioneer Company (the only one on the former lead) and the Britannia, Great Eastern, Abandoned Junc tion, Great Western, and Perseverance Companies, on the latter, are commanding tolerably fair returns. The Red, White, and Blue Lead is nearly exhausted. A few abandoned ground claims have been taken up on it within the month, on the site of the original claims. Proceeding from No. 4 a branch lead has been discovered, and proclaimed by the warden under the block claim system. From the prodigious richness of the Red, White, and Blue Lead up to this point, the new tributary stood in high repute, but explorations since made prove it incapable of sustaining the high standard of excellence its connection with the main lead at first led us to expect. The discovery in such rapid succession of the leads already described has been the cause of introducing a large mining and trading population into the district. On that portion of the newly-proclaimed township of Smythesdale contiguous to the leads there are vast numbers of costly mercantile houses and respectable private residences daily startinginto existence ; streets are formed, and well arranged ; in short the Bocial con dition of the place ha3, within the last two months, assumed an entirely new aspect. And as the per manent success of such enterprise depends entirely"], [53, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 7 join the Falcon Gully, the tributary waters of which flow from thence westward into Smythe's Creek. Eastward of the range forming the southern boundary of the Falcon is the Long thought-about Lead, and south-east is situate the Black Ball Lead aud Old Italian Gully. Their positions and workings are accurately laid down on the accompanying plan. Pursuing a more southerly course, Derwent Jack's Gully intervenes, and to the north-west of this place is situate Spring Dallah Diggings, upon the creek of that name, which takes its rise at the township at Linton's. To the south of Linton's is Happy Valley and Lucky Woman's, and on the margin of the Plains Woady Yallock, at the southern boundary of the mining district. To return to Monkey Gully\u2014 this, like most of the shallow workings in the district, is nearly exhausted. This gully, like most others southward of Brown's Diggings, is confined between abrupt ranges. There is a great want of water felt here during the dry sea son, arising from the absorbent nature of the surface, and the precipitous fall of the gullies. In the winter season moderate wages are made by puddling the sur face, water being obtained by constructing embank ments across the gullies to the opposite ranges. Pat terson's Gully, shown on the plan, may be placed in the same category as Monkey Gully. sunk to a depth of 90 feet, but are unable to proceed further until an engine, now nearly in working order, be completed. Between this and the next prospecting claim several block claims are being worked, and the entire locality presents a busy and animated scene of labour. In Derwent Jack's there are a few Chinese parties at work, and from all I can learn they are doing well. The sinking is shallow and the working inex pensive. On account of the steep and narrow con figuration of the gullies in the neighbourhood no extensive leads may be expected until the open country to the westward, comprising the region of basaltic lava, be reached. Spring Dallah Diggings are situated on the southern side of the creek of that name, but have been aban doned for the last six months. They were found to be payable for a distance of 400 yards, beyond v hich they spread out over a wide area between two slightly elevated reefs, thus reducing the aggregate of auri ferous drift to a very small thickness, by which it was found that the expense of working exceeded the value of gold derived from it. Not far from the junction of the Spring Dallah Creek with Smythe's Creek a very interesting geolo gical phenomenon is met with. It shows more satis factorily the mode in which the auriferous depositions terminate on reaching the margin of the plains than anything I have seen in the district. I shall endea vour to make this the subject of a full report as soon as I can prepare proper sections of the place. On the northern margin of the Creek is an almost perpendi cular precipice of trap-rock, rising to a height of 150 feet, and extending on a line with the Creek for about 400 yards. Underneath this mass of lava a quartzose drift, varying from 1 to 4 feet in thickness, is found, and in some places exposed on the schistose slate. Into this drift several tunnels have been made, ex tending from 100 to 200 feet, but the quantity of gold obtained has not in any case justified expensive spe culation. I shall do myself the honour to transmit sections of this interesting locality. That section of the district, including Carngham, shall be the subject of my next report. Plans of the various workings, &c, shall accompany it. Number of prospecting parties engaged in finding new leads, 18. Number of applications for mining leases, 44. Quantity of ground applied for, 560 acres. On the line of Falcon Gully, which is the receptacle of those described, and other minor gullies, are the leases of the Morning Star, Falcon, and Havelock Companies. In the shafts of the last two immense quantities of water have been met with, and powerful engines are in course of erection. It will require an immense expenditure of capital and labour to effec tually work this district. From this gully, on the margin of Smythe's Vale, southward of Brown's pre-emptive right, a consider able extent of undulating country is met with, and is covered to a depth of fiom 20 to 150 feet with brown and black argillaceous earths. Upon this line of the district five prospecting companies are sinking\u2014 viz., the Prince of Wales, who have sunk 120 feet in allu vial deposit ; the New World Company, 40 feet in a deposit of trap-rock ; the Morning Light, 70 feet in alluvium ; the Argo Company have sunk a second, 100 feet in alluvium ; and the Grand Junction, 130 feet in the same substance. Should any of these companies discover a new lead, it will become one of the most ex tensive in the district. In the neighbourhood of the Black Ball and Long thought-about Leads are the leasing claims of the Prince of Wales and Cornish Gold Mining Companies. Their extent and position I have laid down on the plan. The whole of the claims on the Long-thought-about Lead, up to No. 28,areamalgamated. Thefirst seven are worked out, and are washing up. Their gains are very trivial. Beyond No. 10, the lead makes an acute angle to the south, along the line shown on the tracing, and several shafts have been sunk in vain on the original supposed course. The companies from 21 to 26 are, however, upon deep greund. The quantity of water is overpowering. Effective machinery is in course of erection, so that a few days will suffice to determine the fate of this lead. The Black Ball, which is situated about half a mile distant, over a low dividing range to the southward of the Long-thought-about, takes its rise in the Italian Gully. For a short distance from the place where it was discovered the ground is occupied in block-claims, and from the termination of these claims there are 21 claims laid off on the frontage system. On the first two (amalgamated claims) an engine is being erected, and on several others a-head there are whims. As yet great uncertainty prevails as to the course of the lead, but in about another fortnight this is likely to be definitely determined, as there is a prospecting claim on the gully sunk to a depth of 100 feet \u2014 a depth which indicates the passage of the Black Ball, or some other lead through it. To the eastward of the Black Ball Lead there are two prospecting parties. The first (Russell's) have Creswick Division. (James Stevenson, Mining Surveyor.) The population of the division is as follows : \u2014 Alluvial mining 2,500 Sluicing mining.. 200 Quartz mining 350 3,050 The following table shows the machinery em ployed : \u2014 At work. Idle.

It has been named Separation Lead. The depth of sinking at the prospecting claim is 80 feet, of which, for a depth of 20 feet, there is basaltic rock. The basaltic rock increases in thickness to the west, and is about 50 feet thick on Slaughter-yard Hill. The yield of gold has not been properly ascertained, as puddling machines for washing the dirt are only in process of"], [54, "MINING SURVEYORS* REPORTS. 8 as the \" Little Hill,\" tho northern portion as the \" Large Hill. On the Little Hill but one claim is at work ; the shaft is 190 feet in dopth, and they have found the reef to be 20 feet thick. A few tons of quartz have been raised, but not crushed. In the northern portion, which was worked considerably three years ago and abandoned, there are now five claims at work. In No. 4 they have found three leaders or veins ; and they came on some blocks of the reef formerly worked, 30 feet thick, yielding an average of 3oz. per ton ; a leader 20 feet west, 12 inches thick, not paying ; and another 6 inches thick, yelding 3oz. In No. 2, at 145 feet in depth, the reef is 7 feet thick, and yields 3Joz. The other parties are sinking new shafts, and have not had a crushing lately. There are about 30 miners at work on the reef. 6. All Nations' Gully (Alluvial).\u2014 The top or sur face of this gully, where the sinking varies from 6 feet to 25 feet, is worked out, and the gully was almost abandoned when a party further east bottomed at 68 feet, and found two nuggets, one weighing 121b. 3oz., and the other 41b. 8oz. There are now about 20 claims at work, and about 80 miners. The gold is bright and shotty, with a water-worn appearance. Tbere is no drift found in sinking. It is all a stiff yellow clay, and the wash-dirt is tho same colour, and contains a considerable quantity of quartz, varying Irom 6 inches to 2 feet in depth. The bottom is soft yellow sandstone and clayslate, alternating every few feet, and gold is found imbedded in it to the depth of several inches. e. On Fisher's Reef there is only the prospect claim at work at present. The shaft is 120 feet in depth, reef 3 feet 6 inches thick, and yield 3\u00a3oz. per ton. /. Welshman's and g. Little Boys'. \u2014 These reefs have not been much worked. They have now been abandoned about one year, but are now being taken up by a company. I could not ascertain their thick ness. erection. The prospecting-party, on the day they got the wash-dirt, got a nugget weighing 24oz. 16dwt. From the observations I have myself made, I do not think it will, on the average, pay more than ordinary wages. At this season of the year there will be quite sufficient water collected, by means of dams across tho gully, to wash all the dirt got out. At Clunes, a new quartz reef has been accidentally discovered, the discoverers being engaged in working an alluvial claim. It is on the southern hill, about 200 feet south of Mr. M'Donald's pre-emptive right The cap of the reef was struck at a depth of 100 feet. A shaft was then put down to the depth of 20 feet. from which a drive was opened, passing through the reef, the thickness of which, where cut, is 2 feet 6 inches. None of the quartz has yet been crushed, or its value ascertained. There have recently been three applications for leases of quartz-reefs in this division\u2014 one at Clunes, adjoining Esmond's ; one in the Mount Beckworth Ranges, five miles south-west of Clunes, and one at Spring Hill, adjoining tbe Spring Hill Quartz-Mining Company. There is a large supply of water in this division in the winter season, which might be made much more available for mining purposes than it is at present. The water is now in the hands of several parties whose interests are frequently clashing, and the races are cut too low to be of much service. Were these in terests combined, large reservoirs could be easily con structed at different places, which would give a supply of water for sluicing on an average for 10 months in the year, whereas at present the race having the fullest supply never exceeds eight months. Another advan tage which would be gained would be, that the water could be taken to the highest levels, from whence it could be used successively several times till it reached the level of the creek, and would thus advantageously give employment to more than double the number of men at present employed at sluicing. There are no natural obstructions, but, on the contrary, every na tural facility for such a purpose, as the sources of the Back, Slaty, and Drakes' Creeks are from 200 feet to 300 feet above the level of the creek, where they unite at Creswick, and can command the highest auriferous range. Besides, in the descent, there are many flats which could easUy, at a small outlay, be converted into reservoirs. h. Kangaroo Reef. \u2014 The depth of the present shaft is 130 feet, and the thickness 1 foot 6 inches. The last crushing of 100 tons yielded per ton lOdwts. i. Peterson's Reef. \u2014 Peterson's Reef is at present abandoned. The last shaft working was 160 feet, and there was a drive east and west of 80 feet, but they found only small leaders, which would not pay. I. Parker's Reef. \u2014 This is the most extensively worked reef in the district. There are 11 claims at work, and the prospect claim is working at 120 feet deep. The reef varies from 9 inches to 18 inches in thickness, and the last crushing gave l\u00a3oz. No. 1 south is 140 feet ; reef, 9 inches to 18 inches ; last yield, loz. No. 2 south, last crushing, at 120 feet, 2oz. ; reef, 13 inches. Latterly they have been engaged sinking a new shaft, and they are now 160 feet down. In No. 3 shaft, 180 feet, they have not driven for the reef yet. In No. 4 shaft, 260 feet, they are now driving for the reef. The two last claims use horse whims to draw up their stuff, and, with one excep tion, they are the only claims using whims in this district. In all other cases manual labour is employed with tbe common windlass and buckets. No. 1, north\u2014 shaft, 150 feet deep ; last yield, 9dwt. Nos. 2 and 3- shaft, 170 feet; last crushing, l\u00a3oz.

Barr's Reef .\u2014There is but one shaft at work, 100 feet deep. At 20 feet they put in a drive west 30 feet, and found in about 10 feet of the drive numerous small leaders, varying from 1 inch to 2 feet. They are now sinking to a depth of 200 feet before they drive. o. Homeward Bound.\u2014 No. 5\u2014 shaft, 50 feet ; 2 feet 6 inches thick ; yield, 7dwt. ; at 70 feet the reef is 4 inches thick. No. 4\u2014 shaft, 160 feet; reef, 4 inches thick; abandoned, and there are now no claims at work. I give the results obtained by one company, sluicing on Humbug-hill. The ground was washed from the surface to the bottom \u2014 a depth of 30 feet, the lower 10 of which were a soft clayey reef, and had to be thrown up into the sluice streams. The mode of working adopted was first to cut a face on the ground, and then to turn on the water along its base. Thus the water assisted in cutting down the ground, and frequently blocks of from 20 to 50 tons were so taken down. The shifts were six hours on and 12 hours off, and the work was kept going night and day. The number of day a, of which the following are the results, were 1,777; the area of ground washed, 1,500 cubic yards, being about 8J cubic yards per man per day ; the yield of gold was 245oz., and the estimated quantity of water used per minute was about 300 gallons. At the higher levels the water was used again by the same company, but in a different opera tion. The ground was poor, yielding less than eight grains to the cubic yard ; and it is very unusual to wash such a depth ; yetHn ot withstanding, the returns gave about 11s. per man per day. Gordon Division. (J. B. Cusack, Mining Surveyor.) I have the honour to forward my report for the month of July, and a tracing of the division (No. 10 Ballaarat), on which I have marked the gold workings as directed in the \"Instructions.\" I have supplied an index on the plan to facilitate the explanation of the report. a Mount Egerton. \u2014 This reef is the only one being worked at Egerton. The southern portion is known p. Providence Gully (alluvial). \u2014 The gold is"], [55, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 9 found at a depth of 30 feet, and the sinking is through a stiff yellow clay \u2014 there is no drift\u2014 and the bottom is soft sandstone and clay slate of the same colour. The wash-dirt is 9 inches deep. There is now but one claim at work, but I think the gully will yield well when worked again. It has only been tried in a few places and suddenly left. There is gold on the surface in some of the ranges around it, and every appearance of quartz-reefs on the ranges The gold is large, bright, and not much water-worn. Steiglitz Division. (Thomas Woolgrove, Mining Surveyor.) The population on this field is at present very limited, in comparison to the time when the reefs were in full operation. The number does not exceed 500 ; actual miners, 200. This is accounted for in many ways : by the whole of what are termed here the \"surface leaders\" on the principal reefs having been worked out to the water-level, at 200 feet average depth ; by the effect of the first local regulations, by which miners were limited to 12 feet per man in extent of reef, and therefore would not erect machinery, &c, on such small claims ; by the funds of the miners being exhausted, and consequently their being com pelled to leave from want of the capitalists' assistance to test the deep ground ; by the present dear rate of crushing, which prevents reefs which would pay loz. and over per ton being worked ; and by the want of powerful, effective, and cheap crushing machinery. There is, in my opinion, no gold-field in Victoria where the adoption of extensive crushing machinery and amalgamating apparatus would be more remune rative to the capitalist, and at the same time to the miners, than on this field. The present crushing power does not exceed 13-horse power, a*id the charge per ton is \u00a32 10s. to \u00a32 15s. This will greatly account for the abandoned reefs, and the present limited popu lation. Although the reefs do not, as at Mount Egerton and Clunes, average a great width, still the.r number and extent would well employ a machine whieh would crush on a large and cheap scale. All the reefs marked on plan will pay, if worked in this manner. [Mr. Woolgrove has tent a large plan, show ing the quartz-reefs, &c., in his division.] <**-. Opossum. \u2014 Nos. 1 and 2 south are the only claims at work on this reef. The last crushing from a depth of 160 feet yielded 9dwt. The reef is 1 foot 6 inches thick. r. Union Jack. \u2014 The Union Jack Reef is now abandoned. It was tried to a depth of 80 feet, and gold found, which was very finely spread over the sur face of the stones. It will require superior machinery to rhat in use here to save such gold. *. Lone Star. \u2014 There are no cla ms at work on this reef. The northern portien is in Mr. Potts' lease, and the southern portion is held by persons fonning a large company. The reef varies in thickness from 2 feet to 4 feet. The gold is light\u2014 much like that found on the Union Jack. Some quartz crushed from it yielded 9\u00a3dwt. to the ton. t. u. v. Leviathan, Morgan's, and Moore's Reefs. \u2014 These are all within Mr. Potts' lease. From two to seven feet between these there are some other reefs, but chey have not been properly opened. They are within two or three feet of the surface. 10. Outward Bound.\u2014 The deepest shaft is 90 feet, and tbe reef is six feet thick. Some quartz crushed from it yielded 7dwt. per ton. In some places the reef crops out on the surface. There is no work being done on it at present.

They are now erecting machinery to enable them to go deeper, and to contend with the water. The avenge yield of gold, from data obtainable, was up to October last 300oz. per w eek. It has been much smaller since, but much greater average yields might be calculated on were the reefs worked m an efficient manner ; a large field is open to the capitalist, and an increased demand would ensue for labour.

The principal from which the greatest returns have been made, are Boxing Keel, New- Chum Reef, Victoria Reef, Portuguese Reef and Yankee Smith's Reef. Quartz has been found at various times in all these to exceed 20oz per ton. The produce of the others may be taken at from 6oz. to Uoz. per ton. The general geological formation of the country where reefs have been found is sandstone aud clay slate formation, in many cases cropping out boldly from the sides of the hills, bearing north and south, and dipping both eastand west. Referring to theplan you will see that there are several ranges of cement conglomerates, washed quartz boulders, and trap. The country east of Steiglitz, towards the Anakies, and YouaYangs consists of many diluvial hills, covered with cement conglomerates, bearing gold in small proportions. On Italian Reef, 200 yards of ground have been applied for under a lease. Tho reef is wide here, averaging 2 feet in thickness, and will pay from loz. to l\u00a3oz. to the ton. On the Moorabool, near Morrison's Station, nine miles N.N.W. from Steiglitz, there are about 150 miners, alluvial sinking and sluicing ; also at Dolly's Creek, about two miles farther N., there are 200 miners at work. I will give you the particulars of their operations in my next report. I have not been there for some time. In conclusion, I beg to state that my future plans will comprise drawings of crushing machinery, where any improvements have been made, plans and sections of the different workings on this field, showing dips of lodes, slips, faults and breaks in lodes, particular character, dips, &c, of the strata, &c. BEECHWORTH MINING DISTRICT. The richest claim yet found is that formerly known as the Allies. Victoria Reef, the highest point in the mining district. Spring Creek Division. (Henry Grimes, Mining Surveyor.) Tho prospects of this field are beginning to brighten : companies are being formed, and leases are being taken up ; and there is no doubt that, if well carried out, such companies will prove that this gold field can compete both in richness of quartz and quantity of produce with any quartz gold-field in Victoria. Its isolated position has hitherto prevented a healthy spirit of enterprise ; but its value, extent, and richness, once clearly manifest, a larger popula tion will quickly make it a centre of industry and exertion, which will secure its position in the future. The population is increasing, and the miners are settled. Their numbers are as follows : \u2014 Europeans. Chinese. Spring Creek . . 1,903 1,347 Three Mile 1,602 1,804 Woolshed 1,907 250 Beecliworth .. .. 3,100 \u2014 8,512 3,401 Total population 12,343, against 10,800 in June. There are 8 puddling-machines at work, and 6 steam engines, from 6 to 10 horse-power, employed in raising wash dirt and pumping. A large mining company, to be named the Steiglitz Mining Company, is now in course of formation on the portion of Boxing Reef and Davis's Claim neigh bouring to the Malakoff Claim, which has proved payable to the depth of 350 feet. Mr. R. A. Lawson, of Steiglitz, is the projector of this company, and has secured a lease of the ground referred to \u2014 comprising 11 claims in all, on which 11 shafts have been sunk, co an average depth of 180 feet. The whole of the ground is deemed payable at the lowest levels. The reason why the previous parties were not able to continue their operations was because of the heavy flow of water, and none of the holders had sufficient capital to expend on machinery. It is proposed to make the capital of this company \u00a320.000, and extensive crush ing apparatus and other machinery is to be erected. Considering the nature of my division, it is in a prosperous condition. No new leads or diggings of any importance have been discovered for a length of time, consequently we have to depend almost entirely on those which have already been once worked. In most of the diggings, gold is found in small quantities, from the top to the bed rock ; and as the various strata are intermixed a good deal with sand, the whole could be readily sluiced off and good wages be made. The ground, for instance, shown on tbe accompany ing plan of Pennyweight Flat, containing an area of 200 acres, would pay well for sluicing, and could employ 1,000 men for three years, if only water was to be had. And so it U with the One, Two, and Three Mile, Spring Creek, and Woolshed divisions. The miners who aro still obliged to work with the cradle tell me that on an average they do not make more than 5s. per diem ; and they say they would gladly change the cradle for the sluice-box, if water were to be had, and al a mode rate charge. To show the immense value of water in this district, you will find three puddling-machines laid down on the plan as they are on the ground. I am given to understand that each of these has to pay \u00a32 per week for the water that is allowed it. Now, a sluice-head of 150 gallons per minute for 10 hours, I estimate, would supply 10 puddling-machines, which gives an annual income of \u00a31 ,000, for what has coit \u00a3100 or \u00a3200, for race-cutting, &c. The Perseverance Mining Company, with a capital of \u00a35,000, have leased 300 yards of land on Boxing Reef south. Their ground includes some of the richest claims ou Steiglitz: as much as 49uz. per ton have been obtained from parts of the ground. The ground was abandoned from the reasons previously referred to \u2014 overflow of water, and want of funds to test the deep ground. At the depth of 320 feet there is a pay able vein, and their prospects are, in my opinion, first rate. On Sailor's Reef a lease of 300 yards has bten taken up by Messrs. How, Meigs, and Co. This reef was abandoned from the comparative poorness of the vein, and the high priee of crushing. Quartz has he^n lately obtained from the ground which averaged 4ioz. per ton. The vein is thick\u2014 about 1 foot 6 inches, and will, all ot it, average from loz. to 2oz. per ton. The Gibraltar Company, north of the Malakoff claim, have applied for a lease of 500 yards in length. They intend to erect powerful machinery on the En gine claim, with pumps, &e. The vein is from 1 foot 6 inches to 2 feet in thickness, looks strong and likely to continue, and up to this time has averaged 4oz. per ton. A prospecting shaft has been sunk in the centre of Pennyweight Flat (as per plan). They have gone down several feet below what has always been eon s dered the bed, and come upon a bard sand cement, imxed with patches of gravel ; but the water came in upon them so- fast, and not being well provided with funds, they desisted. They are intending shortly to recommence.

The number of machines from personal ob servation. Population from police reports. I esti mate 300 Europeans (as women and children) other than miners, and 100 Chinamen, as storekeepers, or otherwise employed without being actually miners. During the month of July, a considerable number of claims were taken up on the lower end of the main lead, Indigo, in consequence of another prospecting party having bottomed on 28th July, and found pay able gold. The depth of this prospect shaft is 22 feet, and the party intend slabbing from the top, as the water is somewhat troublesome. This is the first wet Alluvial Mining. \u2014 Mining operations in this district, being dependent altogether on the supply of water, have suriered a slight check during the past month. The very dry weather, combined with the extraordi nary severity of the frosts at night, has had the effect of reducing the avaUable supply of water considerably, and consequently a much less number of hands have been employed, a smaller quantity of soil washed, and the yield of gold diminished. Another consequence of the falling-otf of the supply of water is the innu merable disputes it gives rise to with regard to the priority of rights. It would, indeed, be a great boon to the mining community of this district if water rights were placed on an equitable and permanent footing with regard to each other, and thereby save thw miners* much useless and annoying litigation, as well as the unprofitable out lay of a large share of their hard-earned money. There are but few parties working in the creek at present, the chief workings being on the hills, and in the different gullies leading into the creek. The rate of wages being considerably reduced lately, a great extent of ground that would not pay formerly is now being worked, and according as wages decrease so will the extent of payable ground increase. The great drawback in my opinion to the profitable working of the ground in this division is the number of small streams employed. If three or four of those watei right holders, who have at present barely a sluice head, would amalgamate their supplies, so as to form one good body of water, I think they would find it much more profitable, as well as doing away with end less disputes with respect to priority of right, &c. Another drawback is the difficulty of getting rid of the tailings, which would be much lessened by the use of such a body of water. The Leviathan Company are progressing very satis factorily, having completed 100 yards of tunnelling at the south, and 85 yards at the north end. The nature of the rock they have driven through as yet is a sandstone, with slate veins. At the north end they still continue to get an increase of water as1 they go in, but have not struck any to signify at the south end. Ihere are four men to each end\u2014 two by day and two by night. When completed the supply of water brought into the district by this party will not only benefit themselves but materially assist to develops the resources of the district. There are no quartz claims in this district. I enclose a plan and section of the lower portions of Europa Gully, com mencing at its junction with the Nine-Mile, showing the method employed to work it. The supply of water is received from the natural water of the gully with the addition of tail- water from parties working on the neighbouring hills, all of which passes through the tail-race into the Nine-Mile claim on this lead, ana considering the length to which the lead has extended, and its present depth, it is remarkable that it should have continued dry for so great a distance. The claims up to this prospecting claim, are being- rapidly bottomed with satisfactory results. The wash-dirt, which is expected to average 1\u00a3 oz. to the cartload, is very thin, having in some claims not more than six inches, and rarely exceeding 15 inches, in thickness. A number of claims have been taken up ahead of this prospect claim, and the lead appears to be running direct to the Black Dog Creek. Many of the abandoned claims on this lead are now worked by Chinese. The lower part of the Main Lead at New Ballaarat, where it joins the part called the Wet Lead, has now been taken up, and somo of the claims will probably require engine power. The engines at work now are those mentioned in my last report, and two others are in course of erection. As the lead extends towards Chiltern, more powerful en gines will probably be required. A great loss of time has occurred in procuring and erecting the engines now at work, and as they have only just commenced operations, nothing new can be reported of the pros pects on this part of the lead. The upper part of this lead is veryr patchy, in some places yielding good wages, and in others being worked with ve\\y unsatis factory results. On the Norfolk Lead several new holes have been bottomed on the upper part, and the claims, though not so rich as those on the lower end, are generally good, and will yield above average wages. The lower part of Reefers or Skeleton Lead has been rushed during the last few days, and the prospects obtained show an improvement. The wash dirt is about 24 inches thick, and the gold, which is coarse, is expected to yield l\u00a3oz. to the cart-load. A new lead has just been opened, called the Cale donian, and the prospectors have registered a claim, having a pavable prospect, at a depth of 150 feet. This lead will empty itself into the old lead (Indigo), probably in the vicinity of Mount Pleasant. Sebastopol has been abandoned for the present. Several holes were bottomed and driven across the deep ground without yielding any payable prospect. In regard to quartz, I have only to report the erection of another crushing- machine of horse power The quantity of quartz raised has not more than half employed the two machines previously erected."], [58, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 12 Table showing quartz crushed and gold extracted from the principal reefis at Reedy Creek, since 1st June : \u2014 With this report I forward plans of the lower part of the main lead, Indigo, to the last prospectors shalt, together with portions of the Suffolk and New Ballaa rat Leads ; and will forward in a few days the sections of the Lower Lead, and a connected plan of the whole of the lead, with a general sketch of the district. SANDHURST MINING DISTRICT. Kilmore Division. (F. M. Hill, Mining Surveyor.) Reedy Creek Diggings.\u2014 These diggings are situated about 12 miles easterly from Kilmore, ana have been opened about 10 months; the creek from which they take their name is a tributary of the Goulburn River. The operations at present being carried on here are almost entirely confined to quartz workings ; alluvial mining, seemingly, not having repaid the labour of those engaged therein. Sluicing appears to be more remunerative, several parties havirg cut large and ex pensive races, for the purpose of washing the hills and sidings immediately adjoining the Creek. The popu lation is rather of an unsettled character, numbers constantly arriving with the intention of prospecting the surrounding country ; but, owing to the exceed ingly bad roads, and the difficulty of getting quartz crushed except at high rates, many leave the dis trict, intending to return when more ample machinery shall have been erected. The country surrounding these diggings is extremely precipitous, rendering the transport of both stores and machinery a matter of very great difficulty. There are other reefs opened both at King Parrot and Strath Creeks, but no returns have at present been obtained from these, owing to the impracticable nature of the country. As will be seen by the table, the quartz crushed on Reedy Creek has yielded an average of over 14oz. to the ton ; although the claims of Machinery. \u2014 There are at present two steam crush ing-machines at work on Reedy Creek, in the imme diate vicinity of the township\u2014 viz., Johnson's, a six horse-power engine, portable, with dry stampers and Chilian wheels ; and Hart's, a twelve -horse-power en gine, with eight wet stimpers. There is also a hand Berdan machine, situated at Captain's Reef. Active preparations are also being made for the erection of two other crushing-machines, forwhich I havemarked out the sites on the creek \u2014 viz., Mcholson and Co.'s, situated near Blackman's, on Reedy Creek, about four miles above the township, and Perkins and Co.'s, imme diately above Hart's machine, at the eastern end of the township. Perkins and Co. and Doyle and Co. have considerably exceeded that average. The gold from these claims has been obtained from the surface downwards. The above returns were furnished me by the courtesy of Mr. Donald, the manager of Johnson's crushing works. Owing to Hart's machine being idle, for the purpose of effecting further improvements, I have been unable to furnish the returns of quartz crushed at his machine. MARYBOROUGH MINING DISTRICT. Maryborough Division. (D. O'Leary, Mining Surveyor.) Application has also been made for a site for ma chinery at King Parrot Creek, on which, and in the immediate vicinity, reels have been opened.

Population.\u2014 The population here and on the sur\" rounding reefs is estimated at about 1,200 miners, of whom by far the greater proportion are quartz miners, about 100 men are engaged in sluicing, and some few in puddling and alluvial mining. The two principal reefs at work here, viz., Perkins and Co.'s, late Landrilge's, and Doyle and Co's., are in the immediate vicinity of the township ; and although the other reefs have yielded in most instances hand some returns, still, the distance at which they are situated from the present crushing machinery renders the transporting the quartz to them a matter of great expense ; and until the erection of the projected machinery in then* immediate neighbourhood is com pleted, the quartz raised from them -will, in all pro bability, be stored, and consequently the returns of gold from this place will not exceed the usual amount. Subjoined is a table of most of the reefs at present opened, showing the amount of quartz crushed, and the results obtained since the 1st of June. 10,860 For some time past mining operations in this divi sion have presented a somewhat novel character- As soon as one rush loses its attraction another springs into existence in time to engage the attention of the ever discontented miners, rendering the popula tion of a nature rather fluctuating ; yet it has re mained almost within the limits of the division.

The sinking in this rush at its junction with the old lead is 62 feet, in the course of which the following strata are met with from the surface : \u2014 Loam, 4 feet ; red clay and gravel, 13 feet ; reddish clay, only 18 feet ; white clay and .sand, 12 feet ; red gravel anu sand, 8 feet ; and the next, white clay and gravel, 7 feet, reaches the bottom, which is composed of pipe clay and sandstone. The wash-dirt is composed of white clay and gravel, mixed with small round pebbles, and is about 1 foot in depth. Here there is a gutter 10 feet wide, the wash-dirt out fef which, with the rest, averages ftdwt. to the tub. Further on, at I, the sinking is only 50 feet, and the strata are of a sirsiilar character to those at k. The bottom is pipeclay, 3 or 4 inches of which, and about 6 inches of the clay and gravel, compose the wash-dirt, which averages 3dwt. to the tub. Here the gutter is only 3 feet wide and 2 feet deep. The entire lead is very narrow\u2014 only one payable claim in width (40 feet square). There are 6 engines in the division, of th-J aggregate of 94 horse-power, of which 5 are at work and 1 idle ; there are 9 quartz-crushers at work, -of the aggregate of 104 horse-power, and there are 440 puddling-machines. Two quartz- crushing machines included in the above) are in course of erection at Back Creek, and will have steam up in a few days ; then the quartz-reefers in this division will enjoy the long-desired opportunity of having the quartz in the numerous reefs here about being opened tested at a reasonable cost in the immediate vicinity. Had there been in this division half a dozen more quartz crushing machines, for the erection of which there has been ample inducement, many of the reefs now deserted would have been prospected.

Many of those at the new rushes, viz., Amphitheatre and Mountain Hut, evince that by erecting more comfortable dwellings. In other parts of my district the European popu- lation appears quite settled \u2014 viz., St. Arnand, Four Mile Flat, and Avoca. At the former place more especially, where, in addition to comfortable wooden dwellings, each miner has a (\u25a0mall enclosure, which enables him to furnish his table with those things necessary to domestic comfort. A small rush has again set in at Peter's Diggings. The mining population there at present is about 500. The depth of sinking is from 6 to 16 feet, yielding on an average an ounce of gold to the load. In no other parts of the district c,.n I note any material change since my last report, with the exception of the Amphitheatre and Mountain Hut. The popula- tion at each of the\u00abe places is still on the increase, and I believe the miners on the whole are obtaining a good living. At the former place a nugget weighing 28oz. was obtained last week near the Creek, on a flat where the sinking is about 14 feet, and wet. This has caused a rush to the locality, the results of which I shall ascertain in a few days. Puddling Machines. \u2014 The puddling machines are of one-horse power each, and worked by horses. The quartz machines are of steam power, 28-horse in the aggregate, and capable of crushing 250 tons per week. From the fact of there being only three quartz- crushing machines in this large district, it is evident that this branch of mining has not been properly prosecuted. Why itshould not have engaged; more attention is a matter of surprise, inasmuch as the features, within a radius of several miles of Avoca. proper, indicate that auriferous deposits in quartz are certain to exist. Surface indications of that nature may be observed upon innumerable elevations, and in many of the gullies contiguous the alluvium ha\u00bb never been disturbed. Why this part of the district has been neglected, which in the earlier days of the gold-fields was proverbial for its rich alluvial deposits, is, that since the first large rush in 1853 to Avoca th population has periodically been diverted to othet parts of the gold-fields. Notwithstanding the Amphitheatre and Mountain- Hut diggings are now beyond doubt established gold- fields, and calculated to maintain a large population for some time to come, the probabilities are that this part of the district, in alluvial as well as quartz mining, will ere long be further tested, the results of which I predict will be both favourable and remunera- tive. I beg to transmit a plan of the Amphitheatre diggings, with vertical sections. The Amphitheatre being five or six miles from any surveyed land, I have established a bench mark, 1 chain north of the Amphitheatre Hotel, from which, from the point marked A, bearing S. 82 degrees E., 42 chains, is No. 3 claim, sunk to a depth of 40 feet. The thickness of wash-dirt is 2 feet, yielding \u00a3oz. to the load. The bed-rock is soft yellow sand- stone. Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 also are hill-sinking, at an elevation of 70 feet from the creek, or main watercourse, varying very little in the depth of sink- ng, as well as thickness of wash-dirt. The formation is soft sandstone, intermixed with \u2022\u2022late, or pipeclay. Nos. 10, 11, and 12, although at the same elevation from the creek, yet differ materially from the sinking on the other side of the creek, inasmuch as the depth"], [60, "14 MINING SURVEYORS* REPORTS. Horse puddling-machines at work 142 Horse puddling-machines idle 47 Horse-whims at work . . . . 8 does not exceed 14 feet, and that through a stratum of cement, seven or eight feet thick. The bed-rock is similar, as also the yield of gold and thickness of wash dirt. Nos. 2. 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 are working in gullies contiguous to hills that are now being worked, or upon a flat adjoining the water course, the strata sunk through at each place with the depth of sinking are nearly alike. The forma tion is remarkably soft pipeclay, or rather slate. Nos, 13 and 14 are on the ground first opened six months ago by a large number of Chinese. Imme diately upon tne schist, and only in this particular place, are a quantity of large quartz boulders, the cause of which I can only ascribe to this part being the junction of several small creeks, and the base of immensely high contiguous ranges, and that it has received and retained these deposits. The gold ob tained is very fine. No. 19 claim, on the same fiat, bearing S. 21 deg. 30 min. E., 4 chains from the bench mark, is ground from which a nugget weighing 28 ounces was taken last week. The party, consisting of two, since obtained40 ounces of coarse gold in three weeks, from an area of ground not more than 12 feet square. This portion of ground was previously worked three years ago. Section b. c. is a part of the main road leading from Avoca to Ararat, and occupied at present under business licences, forming the main street, immediately behind which is the Po lice Camp. No. 20 is a water-race, belonging to Messrs. Boyce and party, the source of which is the Amphitheatre Creek, the water being conveyed by gravitation a distance of 15 miles, to some old work ings on Rutherford's Creek. To those employed it is only as yet paying moderate wages. No. 21 is a water race belonging to Messrs. Wilton and party, cut a dis tance of thret> miles from a creek on the Lexton road. The general state of the division, in so far as allu vial mining is concerned, has somewhat improved during the month of July. Five prospecting claims have been granted b\\ the Warden, viz , one at Coch rane's ; one at Mosquito Flat ; one at Cay's ; and two at Moliagul. None of these have led to the opening of any large extent of ground. Great hope is entertained that a rush which has taken place be ween Sandy Creek and Newbridge, and named the Tarnagulla diggings, is the commencement of an extensive gold-field. Up to the last of the month, 300 miners were at work, with encouraging prospects\u2014 some having taken as much as 3\u00a3oz. off the bottom of their shafts. Sirce then the population has increased to about !)00. The lead is what is called patchy, and not of great width as yet, and the gold is coarse ; but from its commencement in a shallow gully it is gradually opening upon a large flat spread ing out towards the Loddo.., deepening as it goes, and entering on surveyed land. The pro bability is that, if tne gold be traced into the flat, an extensive rush will be the result. A more likely place cannot be imagined. From the rich auriferous Sandy Creek ranges, there is a gradual descent towards the Loddon, with innumerable gullie and hills, either going right on to its banks, or spread ing out into large flats on its margin. Auriferous reefs are opened in the neighbourhood. Corfu, one of the richest in the colony, is within a few hundred yards of the lead, being almost a certain proof that it is rich in alluvial gold also, and only wants prospecting In quartz-mining, four prospecting claims have bee\u00bb granted during the month \u2014 viz., one on Ca nadian Reef, one on Halfway (both near the new rush), one on Yeoker's Reef, Bet Bet, and one on Co katoo Reef, Sand y Creek. Five claims on established reefs have struck gold\u2014 viz., two on Perseverance, near uunolly ; two on Baiker's Reef, Sandy Creek ; and one on Corfu, the prospectors of whi<-h have a large quantity of stone out, which will, I have no doubt, yield from 2\u00a3lh. to 31b. per ton. To counterbalance this addition, Kangaroo Reef, at Cay's, hah partially discontinued its yield, tbe resf having run out in some of the claims for the present. All the payable reefs in tbe division are being energetically worked, and con siderable additions are being made to the number of machines. No. 22 is also a water-race belonging to Messrs.

Several good patches have been struck on the old diggings, and* some heavy gold got in shallow sinking ; but the lucky parties have bten few in number. The lead in the old flab is being gradually traced upwards in a series of tolerably rich patches. There is little doing in quartz mining, and few parties are at work ; but I have been informed that some previously worked and abandoned reefs are likely soon to be worked with the aid of powerful machinery. A branch of the National Bank has been established in the township (Wedder- burn), and several other similar establishments may be expected to follow. The township is daily improv- ing, and the population is both orderly and settled. Explanation of the Sections.\u2014 From the engine- shaft the excavation marked D extends 40 feet north, where the work is being carried on at the same time, being worked higher by means of temporary scaffolds. The drive marked E is carried 45 feet further than the workings opposite to shaft No. 5, on section figure 3, where an excavation 20 feet square in the reef is immediately to be used as a blacksmith's shop. The reef on vein F, on the east side, is tnus exposed 85 feet in length by 10 feet deep, but has only just been broken through four feet thick at its junction with the main reef, from which place on the east side the sample or specimen marked No. 4 was taken. There is no timber used for propping at present in this claim, and it is not likely to be required while the works are carried on in the same manner, the quartz in and adjoining tne reef being of the hardest possible nature. The western side of the reef has been worked for two or three feet thick, at a higher level frrm shaft No. 4, and northward. Gold is found throughout the whole width of the reef at excavation D, but is best towards the eastern side. This discovery was only made lately while cuttine through at platform g. g., and the best lead of gold is expected to turn westward through the reef, and join at the upper or first lead on the western side. The hard sandstone rock, marked e. e. in fig. 1, aud D in fig. 2, is identical in character, and in both places adjoins the best quartz on the east and west; aud as the small leaders in level C, fig. ?, all appear to run out towards it, very likely the leader E, on fig. 2, will befoundauriferousondrivingtothewestward to its junction with the body marked D. Thecreek in- dicated in section fig. 3 is very singular, but its dan- gerous state prevented my making such examination as I would have desired. On entering it from old drives on the north side, at a depth of 120 feet (the under portion being filled up opposite shaft No. 4), the rock and slate runs east and west through the entire body of the reef, intermixed with small quartz leaders, which contain a little gold. In consequence of the water having been allowed to rise 18 months ago, there is now an opening or cavity west perpen- dicular to where the reef was struck (about 20 feet), extending about 50 feet high, where it is about 20 feet wide, presenting a very rugged appearance, with water continually running down. By the aid of several lights held upon poles, the roof of the opening appears to be the leader E on fig. 2, but is broken and loose, intermixed with sandstone, slate, &c. The gold on the east side, at excavation D, may yet be traced to a considerable height towards the surface, where the reef was worked or tried on the west side. The east side has not yet been seen except for a small space at shaft No. 1, on section fig. 3, n^ar the cap of the reef The working of this reef has been greatlj retarded, owing to a number of miners being connected with it, and the want of co-operation, combined with the small area of the ground (12 feet square) allowed to each miner at tbe time it was dis- covered. There have been upwards of 40 shafts sunk between the foot of the hill and the outcrop ot the reef, to an average depth of upwards of 90 feet, and the sinking has been of the hardest description. In all eases where the reef has been worked to the bottom (same as at platform g. g.), there has still been a leader or vein to be traced downwards containing gold. At shaft No. 5, a vein was discovered underneath \"\\About half the month, Kingower.\u2014 Digging operations have not continued so favourable as during last month, the surface rushes at New Chum Gully not being of great extent, and no other new ground having been subsequently dis- covered. The miners are scattered in almost every old gully, the nature of the ground always presenting a chance of success, whilst any remains unworked. A party of 30 Chinamen arrived here from Korong, and have been besides engaged during the month amongst the old ground ; but fine gold being too scarce, they will most probably soon remove to another field. The Union Heef is still improving, and the shareholders are sanguine of ultimately obtaining remuneration for their expenditure of capital and labour. Sections are sent herewith, and also specimens of quartz, &c, con- taining various metallicand other substances, together with explanations of sections, &c. Jericho and Jordan's are considerably duller this month, and many of the quartz claims are abandoned, ar registered, which I do not expect will ever be re-oc- cupied by the original owners. Two claims on a newly discovered reef, called the Staffordshire Reef, are being worked, and are yielding a little gold. Milkman's Reef is now likely to be well prospected, there being six claims in work, but the prospectors only have as yet obtained payable gold. The position cf these reefs is indicated on the traciug herewith sent. The latter reef was discovered several months ago, but I did not consider the work likely to be carried on. The crushing-machine has suspended operations during the last few weeks, owing to the want of water. From 200 tons of quartz crushed here during the months of June and July, the average yield has been about loz. per ton. M'lntyre's is very dull ; the few alluvial miners resi- dent there are engaged in the old workings. On Marshall's Reef the Amalgamated Company and the owners of Claim No. 1 north are persevering, but the sinking being very difficult, little progress has been made, and no main reef has hitherto been discovered. Fenton's and Synnotfs. \u2014 These diggings are still in the same languid state as last month. The majority of miners on the latter place are Chinamen, several of the Europeans having gone to a rush at Peter's Dig- gings. Prospecting parties are out both from Synnotfs and Fenton's, and from the similarity of the surround- ing country there is every likelihood of payable ground being discovered. Korong. \u2014 Mining affairs have remained without much alteration during the month, except the sudden appearance, and equally sudden departure, of large numbers of Chinese. The rush which recently occurred to a new gully in the Mallee scrub is at present quite quiet, though those who are washing up, with some exception, express them- selves satisfied. The difficulties of prospecting in the scrub have latterly been increased by the scarcity of water, but during the month gold has been found in new ground by several parties ; and if one or two dray-tracks could be cut through the scrub (as has been done at the Whipstick or Bendigo), so as to admit of provisions, &c, being procured more easily, there would soon be a large gold-field opened in tne rt a OQ'S s g i- | \"\u00ab | \u00bbh .g .5 =\"3 2 1 to -1 a a . 1 tog .3 \u00ab . sis 3.3 a.^ 5 1 1 1 2 gl-s 37 8 Korong Kingower . .

Explanations of Plans and Sections. \u2014 The section of Forest Creek No. 3 pdjoins No. 2 on Wattle Flat, and No. 1 on the main Government-road. The principal features of No. 3 are the quartz reef (of which an ac count is given), the rich alluvium encircling the reefs, and the fact that no payable diggings have been found beyond this point, although an immense \u2014 - lies to the south-east towards Elphinstone, Taradale, and Fryer's Town, the ranges and gullies being inter sected with quartz reefs. Plan of quartz workings (A) is a crop section on the old Post Office Hill Reef.\u2014 Vide report. At A the early reefers supposed the reef exhausted, in some places the vein A, leading to the main body, being | of an inch in thickness. . The cap arid underwork ings are in proximity, and the line of bedding is of decomposed slate (yielding 16oz. to the ton) ; the large body of quartz averages loz. per ton, and the best \" country\" for gold is the rippling slate. Supposing the reef to continue easterly, No. 2 shaft was sunk to work it, but a break (m) occurred, the strata taking a westerh dip, and the quartz became non-payable. It has not yet been prospected to discover continuations of auriferous quartz. Shaft 3 was sunk to cut the reef on its return westerly, but striking water at 85 feet prevented its further prosecution. Section B is a portion of Phillips Reef, Wattle Gully. It has been payable from the surface, the main reef yielding 5oz. to 6oz. to the ton. In driving a cross adit, several lodes were cut, two of which, shown on section, were afterwards cut in sinking the water shafts, and from their declination these will join the main reef. When the water-shaft struck quartz at 85 feet, the rush \u00a9f water was so great as to prevent further operations. Post Office Hill Reef (vide section of Forest Creek No. 3) is situate a little to the west of the ehtrarce to the Forest Creek diggings. In the early days of gold mining very rich alluvium skirted its aides on the north, rising gradually from the creek, and on the east and we*t ricn gullies and surface workings, which to tbe present time afford constant employment to many miners. The term \"Old Po<,t Office Hill Reef \" has always been applied to the reef first opened upon that hill about five years ago (marked d. on plan), which first presents itself to the surface on claim No. 2 north (now occupied by Messrs. Russell and Co.), at which point the cap of the reef is only in the straggling form of leaders, the principal run of the surface leaders being mixed v* ith decomposed slate or pipeclay.- This surface-run extends to five claims south ; but a re markable feature in the lay of the reef is, thatata point 30 feet from Russell and Co.'s boundary-peg in claim No. 1 (nelonging to Messrs. Phillips and Co.), where in that portion of the claim the leaders dip northerly, in the remaining portion they dip southerly, formiD-r what may perhaps be rightly termed a crown-claim, though the natural surface of the hill at that point presents no such aspect The old Po\u00abt-office Hill Reef h called by many tbe Poor Man's Reef, from its uniform and steady yield, and from the fact of all its quartz being more or less auriferous\u2014 that in Messrs. Phillips and Co.'s claim, in the poorest part, yielding 7dwt. to the ton, and containing great bodies, from 18 inches to 2 feet in thickness, and in some places with an unknown extent in depth. This claim has from its first open ing been very remunerative, on account of its easy working and its large quantities of stone ; and, although its chief workings have onlv extended to a depth of 40 feet, and only half of such ground is worked, yet it has yielded between \u00a32,000 and \u00a33,000 to its present owners. The principal part of the workings have been easterly of the cap. From a upli otu21 feet from the surface a leader was traced, which, though insignificant in its opening, has led to the entire excavation of a piece of ground now re- CASTLEMAINE MINING DISTRICT.

A new rush in alluvial mining has taken place n the Cemetery Flat, Campbell's Creek (on ground reviously prospected, but unworked in consequence Of the immense under drainage), and 470 Chinese and few Europeans are profitably employed- The sink ing averages 16 feet. The strata are black soil, 4 feet, ; clay, 5 feet 6 inches ; shingle and water-worn gravel 4 to 4\u00a3 feet; coarse auriferous drift, 12 to 18 inches, resting on alternating bands of slate, pipeclay, and soft sandstone of rich bright colour. The yield varies from \u00a3dwt. to 8dwt. to the tub. The best de posits are found on slate bedrock. Such new discoveries within the division do not affect ordinary mining operations, because generally, when an extra activity takes place in any one portion of the division, it is counterbalanced by a lull in some other portion ; but, in extraordinary mining opera tions, a very remarkable feature is, the unprecedented demand for shares in mining companies, and the avidity to invest in any advertised scheme, running the shares up in some instances to exorbitant premiums, apparently regardless of the bonafdesof the transaction, and unless this is restrained it must inevitably result in failure, disappointment to the capitalist, and dis astrous consequences to the gold-fields. A few un principled speculators will enrich themselves at the expense of the diggings and the colony, aud confidence in mining speculation will be lost. Capitalists have long been invited to invest in min ing enterprise in this division, and nothing could so tend to develop our vast auriferous resources, or be more certain of realising profit on investments. We have an immense field for the investment of capital ; nearly all our quartz-reefs and old alluvial workings could be profitably worked, provided capital was ob tainable on bond side transactions, and carefully and judiciously expended. Associations require, in addition to being properly constituted, to be properly managed ; civil and me chanical engineering must be suitable and efficient,"], [63, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 17 mark ably well prospected, containing an area of 60 x 40 x 6 feet. The leader, or vein, is encased in a soft ripply slate, dipping at an angle of 45 degrees, form- ing here and there into large \" bodies,\" and then spreading away over large projecting masses of sand- stone alternating with fiats of the same kind of stone, upon which tbe \"bodies\" of quartz become immensely large. The furthest stretch easterly into ground that these \"bodies\" have been traced is to a depth of 05 feet, where they return westerly at a very gradual in- cline, and the whole substratum there at such depth takes a westerly dip. A shaft has been sunk in the same claim to a depth of 85 feet, jvhieh struck water. The nature of the stone which is aur.ferous is very soft and easily broken, and it is always more auri- ferous when cased with slate ; also where the stone contains much mandick or pyrites it is a good sign of gold. Some leaders are of a different nature, having much loose gold, whilst others, on the contrary, have the precious metal strongly imbedded in the matrix and are solid bodies. The observations of experienced miners who have worked upon the reef for some time tend to show that when any leader is about to ex- haust itself, it appears to them to be occasioned r>n- tirely by a gradual protruding of sandstone, call d a \" throw,\" which in some instances is found to be a floater,\" as they call it, aud in a distance of 8 or 9 feet is often entirely lost sight of, the leader taking its original features. In other instances it is totally lost, but it is fouud that the leader will generally at some point preceding its being lost show a \"gutting,\" say 9 or 10 feet back, where a remarkable mass or lump of quartz is apparent, and it is from this \" shoulder\" that it again takes its lead, and re-forms at the next point. In a place where this did not occur the general incline of the mass cutting the leaders was taken as a guide, and gave successful results, by discovering it on a lower plateau in the direction of the * ' throw\" of the intercepting mass. Returning to No. 3 section of Forest Creek Reef A, claims 2 to 6 south are being worked very profit- ably ; but in Nos. 7 and 8 no reef has been found, although a large body of quartz has been prospected in the adjacent gully, crossing which we come to the first shaft on the Hard Hill Reef, the principal characteristics of which are similar to the Old Post- office Hill Reef. The order of strata in shaft No. 1 B is\u2014 sandstone to a depth of 40 feet, below that alter- nating slate and sandstone, with quartz leaders run- ning through the sandstone at intervals of 2 or 3 feet. To a depth of 50 feet the quartz leaders dip towards the east, but to the west below that depth. At 55 feet is a soft red sandstone, which continued to 59 feet, where was found 6 inches to 1 foot of soft slate and sandy gravel, from which gold was obtained by wash- ing ; and underneath was a large body of quartz, run- ning to an unknown depth. Claims 2, 3, and 4, have each yielded to successive owners from 1 to 3\u00a3 oz. to the ton, but No. 4 his been r ost productive, having yielded gold from the surface downward. In it, at a depth of 35 feet, a large body of auri- ferous quartz was struck, or peculiar formation, its bearing being nearly due east and west, or at right angles to the ordinary run of the reefs Its extent or continuation has not yet been ascertained. From cap of reef in claim No. 5 exceedingly rich surface and alluvial diggings run thence into Golden Gully. The claim has yielded well, Messrs. Thompson and Co. em- ploying a number of men thereon, and they are exert- ing their utmost to abstract as much as possible, having received a notice to quit from the railway con- tractors. To the south of No. 5 the reef has been and is now being prospected, and gold obtained, but not in payable quantities. To the north of Messrs. Rus- sell and Co.'s claim, No. 2 A, several shafts were sunk without gold being obtained, excepting in one claim (son plan), at a distance of 400 feet. The first claim north of Messrs. Rubsell and Co.'s was sunk to a depth of 50 feet, and very well prospected, but the strata werequite different from what had been found on other parts of the reef, presentine- a shaley slate and pieces of mundick the Rize of walnuts, but not a trace ot auriferous quartz could be discovered, nor can we account for its absence other than that the line of reefs continuing in their coui se or general bearing would be found in depth below watermark, or that a \" shake\" occurring it takes its new formation in reel No. 2 a, lately opened. For some length of time yet it will be impossible to determine the point, although surjh knowledge would 'ue \u25a0 f much service. The Old Post office Hill Reef bears N. 10 degrees W., whilst reef 2 a, and B hear N. 5 degrees W., but are so little distant apart that probably the four workings may ultimately unite, the natural features of the sur face and the contortion of the rocks favouring such a result. The length of workings, north and south, is 3,800 feet, on which are employed 85 men, in addition to carters, machinists, &e. Fryer's Creek Division. (Augustus Poeppel, Mining Surveyor.) The report I have to furnish you tor the past month of mining progress is decidedly favourable. Two new reefs have been opened, one of a payable chaiacter, aud the other with every indication of proving so at some future time. Ordinary alluvial mining has presented no new fea ture deserving of notice, excepting a few stray nug gets, which have been discovered in Little Nuggetty. The puddlers are still busy, having plenty of water at command; they make no complaints as to their re turns, consequently it is but reasunaole to infer they are making fair wages. I regret not being in a posi- tion this month to piocu e aud forward puddling re turns from the different gullies and fiats. To ac complish this would occupy considerable time ; how ever, I hope to do so either the next or succeeding month. No doubt, a tab'e of this description would be of some value.

They were induced, however, subsequently to relinquish their claims for a consideration ; indeed, it is said that some of them wish for a greater interest in the un dertaking than their claims alone entitle them to. This hill was first opened in 1852, and has up to the present period been more or less occupied by the individual miner. Many instances of extraordinary success by parties who have worked there is a matter of notoriety. It may be said that this hil has proved a remirkable one, often the scene of a \" rush,\" and as often of temporary abandonment ; even at tbe present time it is looked upon by a few as a last resource, when they encounter ill luck in other localities. One peculiar feature in connection with the Hill is the fact of there being what is termed two bottoms, that is, where the auriferous deposits are found. The depth of sinking varies from 16 to 25 feet, although in the north-wes tern side the surface workings gradually extend into shallow, and thence into deeper grouud ; aud this part may be described ns having been the richest part of the hill ; and here the puddlers have been particularly busy during the past two years, and not a little fortunate in their returns. The north-eastern and eastern sides vary from 17 to 20 feet depth of sinking, the gold being found in the slate and sandstone rock, and in the gravel above. The hard sandstone bottoms have proved the most prolific, and, in many instances, the gold has been found to have penetrated from 3 to 4 feet in narrow crevices. This accounts fur the occasional suc cess of parties who have perseveringly adhered to the \"fos-icking system,\" that is, clearing out the old drives, and breaking up the bottoms, &c. The slate and pipe-clay bottoms have in point of richness been secondary to the sandstone. This is the statement of those who have had great experi ence in working on the hill. Although, as before stated, there are two bottoms, the first stratum has ranked foremost in importance. At a distance of from three to four feet from the latter a stratum of sand or pipeclay is frequently met with, containing gold in abundant quantities, traced from the main bottom, and jumning, as it were, into the higher stratum. These peculiarities, although well known to those who have worked there, have only partially been taken advantage of\u2014 namely, in the nhallow sinking where paddocking was more practicable ; hence an extensive system of sluicing (which the company propose to adopt, facing and washing all before them) will un doubtedly prove successful. The chief oiffioulty which presented itself at first was the supply of wat<-r, as an immense quantity would be required daily ; this diffi culty, however, is now likely to be overcome, by pro curing tbe water from a very wet flat about half a mile distant, pumping it to a certain elevation, and thenceconveyingitbymeansof arace(and flumes where necessary) to the side of the hill where the sluicing operations are being co. iducted. With respect to the yields from claims in different parts of the hill, and on various occasions, it is not necessary for me to refer, except of recent date. For instance, a party of two, who have sold their claim to the company, but who were allowed to work until they commenced opera tions, obtained last week 4oz. to 37 loads of dirt, washed four feet high. Another party, who have a claim running into the centre of the hill, are making good wa-;es at the present time. The lowest average obtanedby the puddleris 2s. 6d. per load from this hill. vested in the Fryer's Creek division. Our main gul lies, hills, and slats, have been remarkably productive of the precious metal, and have hitherto been worked by simple and inefficient machinery. This is made more apparent when we take into consideration the fuct of the old workings heing repeatedly turned over. It must therefore be evident, if efficient steam or other machinery *ere brought to bear, the old workings would still be productive. Hitherto (with the exception of the Old Pennyweight Hill Company and the Fryers Town Mining Association) the puddling-machine has not been superseded, and ah hough there are some 230 in use in this district, a vast amount of ground is still unoccupied. For merly the miners had a great an'ipathy tocomp-nies in general, but this feel nt; is esradually dying away, as many of those most bitter in their opposition are now, if not supporter-, at least indifferent to their existence ; while others, whose individual efforts are unaided b> mechanical appliances, are anxious for their bein^ established. In many ot the projected schemes for enriching the capitalist and benefiting the working miner, exaggerated statements are un doubtedly made, the truth of which could easily be tested if inquiries were made in the proper quarters (this is intended to be general in its application) ; but those living at a distance from the scene where the mineral wealth is reported so abundant, are content to offer enormous premiums for shares without knowing their h-zitimate value. This, eventually, is calculated to r- tard rather than advance mining enterprise, and would be more detri mental to the working miners' interest than to tho-e whose means will admit of temporary pecuniary loss. I now propose to offer some remarks up' n the companies which huve recently been started, and give such information as I have had opportunity of ac quiring. The Strathloddon Gold Mining Company. \u2014 Mr. Rogers, au enterprising miner, has been instrumental in the establishment ot a company upon the Old Pennyweight Hill, being the second now formed on the same hill, his grant being contiguous to Mr. Cameron's grant. A portion of the two acres which he at present holds belonged to a party who had been particularly successful. The wash-dirt is similar in character, and equal in thiokness, to that of the neigh- bouring company, although up to the present time they have only wished to the extent of 4 or 5 feet, which has averaged about 3dwt. to the load. They are working the ground from a tunnei, having a tram- way running into the hill, and extending to a pud- dling machine, where the dirt is washed. During the past week they washed 50 loads, from which lOoz. were obtained. They have now suspended operations until steam machinery can be obtained, thinking it desirable to conduct their washing oti a more extensive sjale. To effect this object, the raising of capital was found neces>ary. The projectors of this company con- sider they have a very fair prospect before them, and are \"anguine of succes-. The Ballaarat Gold mining Company. \u2014 This com- pany owes its origin to some Ballaarat miners, who had been travelling about the diggings in search of a mutable place for the investment of labour, combined with capital. The Commissioner's Flat so far attracted their attention as to induce them to make application for a grant of 7 \\ acres, in whu-h they have been successful. The party consists of 30, all working partners, and they propose to work the ground (which ib very wet) by a system of paddocking ; having a steam-engine and a washing cylinder, this flat has been very much worked by Europeans and Chinese \u2014 some very fine patches having been discovered on different occasions. The sinking varies from 12 to In feet, comprising black loamy soil, louse drift, gravel, and boulders ; and the guld is of a very nuggetty character. The Chapel Hill Quartz Mining and Crushing Com pany.\u2014This company has been formed by storekeepers and others for the purpose of working the Chapel-hill Reef, which had been abandoned for some considerable time. At present they have had crushed, as a trial, 12 tons, which have averaged 16dwt. to the ton, the leader, aboutthree feet in thickness, commencing from near the surface. The 12 tons were taken from a heap on the surface, promiscuously. The company are at present making arrangements for a steam-engine and crushing apparatus. They consider they have The Windlass Hill Company. \u2014 ThN company \"have succeeded in obtaining a grant of the greater portion of Windlass Hill, comprising au area of five acres of ground. On making application, the projector of this"], [65, "MIXING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 19 every reascn to anticipate profitable returns when they have their machinery, &c, iu working order. The following table shows the yields from different claims during the past month on quartz reefs : \u2014 The Emu Creek Gold-Mining Company.\u2014 A short time previous to the existence of the above company, tho original proprietors had registered their claim, and I believe for two reasons\u2014 1st., that they ouid amal gamate with an adjoining claim ; and, 2nd, to fur nish an opportunity of establishing a company, in order that asumcientamou<t of capital might be raised for better conducting their operations, improving their machinery, &c. They have now 3,0 feet run of the reef, by a cross measurement of 400 feet\u2014 a large area of ground\u2014 which undoubtedly abounds with quartz leaders, varyingin thieknessand extent. Messrs. Lawler and Co. have hitherto met with little success, but they have certainly every reason to anticipate an amount of payable stone, especially when taking into consideration the handsome return of a late crushing from a claim 3 chains distant, belonging to Messrs. Sutton, Smith, and Co. The projectors of this com pany are surely deserving of success ; they have evinced a spirited and persevering determination to develop the reef, and it is lo be hoped, with ample means at their disposal, they will eventually be suc cessful. Sutton, Smith, and Co (private company).\u2014 The re- sult of a crushing from 4 tons in this claim (l42oz.), mentioned in my laht report, has given an impetus 10 quariz-mining in general, more particularly to those whj have claims on the same hill. Since the crushing- adverted to, the party obtained 17\u00a3oz. from 8 tons, 5 to 6 feet from the surface. Subsequently they sent a lot of refuse to the mill, consisting of large blocks of quartz, in which the colour of gold was not visible. This amount of 00 tons averaged 7dwt. to the ton. There is, therefore, ample testimony to lead to the conclu- sion, that the whole of the large block (which is many feet in thickness) is more or less auriferous, and which would pay for crushing. The patchy nature of the quartz leaders is sufficiently apparent to warrant the party extending their operations, em- ploying more men, and erecting machinery of their own. About a year and a half ago >60oz. were ob- tained by another party from the same claim, about 20 feet distant from the 142oz. patch lately discovered, and only three feet from the surface. On that occa- sion the party ceased working in the claim, as they had purchased other claims equaby promising, and from which they were also obtaining rich stone. They deferred reworking the original claim, for so long a period that it became \"jumpable,\" and was accordingly taken possession of by the present holdeix The present party are evidently working at a disad- vantage, there being so vast an amount of payable quartz (inoependei'tly of patches) which would, be- yond doubt, justify them 111 erecting machinery of their own, and thus save a considerable per- centage on the expenses necessarily incurred, and ftirther, there would be no necessity for selecting portions of blocks or leaders for crushing, as they could excavate and cru^h all before them. With increased means and appliances, and abetter ejTstem of working their claim adopted, the resources of the reef would be better developed. At a depth of 100 feet from the surface gold has been found in the leaders, but very little quartz has been crushed taken from this depth. Tunnelling from the level of the gully opposite would be the best means of work- ing the claim ; it would be much more economical than lilting 100 feet, that is, provided the party are desirous of prospecting the deeper parts of the hill. Rowe and L'o. have the adjoining claim to the latter. They have a steam-engine and crushing machine, a description of which was furnished in my last. This party, during the past eight months, have averaged \u00a38 per week per man (eight in party). They are still working on surface leaders, although sonic of the party have sunk down to tbe depth of SO feet, and found leaders the whole way.

Ike Sludge Question.\u2014 '1 his still remains a difficult one ; the puddlers are puzzled to knov how to aet in the matter. Dead Man's Flat, bom the overflow and gradual settlement of the sludge, is now impassable lor vehicles, and it is absolutely dangerous for any to pass along, that is, f'llowii g the course of the Govern m nt road. The evil is occasioned by some 300 or 400 puddlers, who, in allowing the sludge to leave their machines and run by the natural water-course of the creek consider themselves irresponsible for any im pediments which may obstruct it* progress when at a considerable distance from their workings. .Now, according to the by-laws of this division, every machine-holder is held responsible for keeping the main drain of the creek, or gully, free from obstruc- out.

A difficulty has now arisen in this respect\u2014 the last machine-holder (to carry out the by-law) would have to keep tbe main drain clear for about one mile, and this would necessitate his employing a man especially for the purpose. At present he is not only indisposed to do so, but would suspend working if compelled to carry out the rule, and in all probability others would follow his example, thus causing a cessation of puddling operations to those whose liability would be established.

The various gold-mining companies are com mencing work in earnest. On the 6th inst, the Union Company began operations, both in crushing and pumpiog, and are now raising some very beautiful stone frum a depth of about 170 feet from iheir claim of 527 feet in length . The beam engine of 35 horse power is by far the most complete at Tarren gower; their first crushing of 10 tons yielded 15oz. of gold. 266 901 The Porcupine Flat Gold Mining Association have finished their dam, and have advertised for tenders for further work hi connection with the undertaking. The above are exclusively diggers, not including storekeepers, ac. The nature aud number of applications are as fol lows : \u2014 The Beehive Quartz Mining Company are very busy erecting their newly-purebased engine of 45-horse power on the west side of the reef, which will both pump and crush.

There are 20 steam-engines at woik, of the aggregate of 24 5 '94- horse power ; the number of stampers is 138, and the number of rollers 18. There are )i) puddJtng machined, and 11 horse-whims. The Li-le Reef Mining Association, on Mount Tar rengower, are busy erecting a 1 5-horse power engine, which, I think, will turn out a very pmfitahe invest ment foi capital, as already upwards of 1,580 feet of reefs in i hat neighbourhood are being worked. The position of this engine will save the expense of the stuff being carted into the township, and there is excellent storage for almost any quantity of water. I he tables I have the honour to enclose show the numbers of the population, gathered by pe*-so>iS on whom I could rely, who visited the various places when work was going on, and counted the numbers working on the ground Alihough these tables show different amounts to those of the previous month, I believe thtm to be correct. It took two men three days to collect the minihers, and every part where work was going on was visited for that especial pur pose. The next table shows the number and description of the various applications. There are no less than 14 applications in one month occurring for the allowed quantity of ground on old abai doned reefs, which in every instance has been 320 feet, with cros-s or boun dary lines of 200 feet on either hide of tho base line, making a total of 4,4o0 feet. These are for the under mentioned reefs : \u2014Gough's, S'ewart's (the mount in two instances), Mosquito Kangaroo, Pardons. Wil son's (in two instances). Parkin's (in two iustanees), Lisle's, and Christie's. Five applications were made for dams and puddling machines, principally at Porcupine Flat. 15 acres - roods 12 perches have been set out for machinery, storage for refuse matter for some existing crushing companies, and about three acres fur the Maldon Gold Mining and Washing Company for a similar purpose, making a total awarded to that com pany of 14 acres. Fifteen claims on Smith's Eagle Hawk have, or are about to be, amalgamated, for the better working of those claims, which are at present completely flooded. All the claims immedictely north of those are legit- The Maldon Gold Mining and Washing Company are busy laying down tmm-roads, making and improving dams, and erecting hauling appaiatus foi bringing the wash-stuff to the cylinder, and they will be prepared to commence in earnest in a few days. They have only had about one day's fair trial of the ground, and that gave them about 8oz. at the washing off. Wil-on's Reef, Long Gully.\u2014 This reef was the first opened on Tarrengower, and at the time it was dis covered was known to the diggers as Specimen Hill. About the beginning of January, 1854, there was an alluvial rush to the east of the reef At thai time several of the surface stones were found to contain gold ; and on a further examination the reef was con sidered payable. On the 20th Januarv, 1854, Messrs. M'Nulty, Wilson, and Hurley marked.'- tf three claims, and commeiced operations. Messrs. Ledger and Co, speedily followed their example, and obtained some ot the iichcst stone ever found at Tarrengower. Mr. Wilson considered, from the richness of the stone obtained, that it would pay to employ machinery, which he procured. Thy hr*t machine turned out a failure ; and nothing further was done till Mr. Chrystal started his machine in Long Gully, when it was found that the average yi^id from Wilson's claim"], [67, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 21 was 9oz. to the ton. On one occasion, he and his mates obtained gold to the value of \u00a31,500 in one week, and on another occasion \u00a31,000 in the same time. From this claim alone gold was obtained to the extent of 4,000oz. in two years. All the claims in the vicinity of Wilson's paid largely, though it is impossible at this distance of time to ascertain the exact yield. The reef ran out at a depth of 40 feet, and was allowed to rest till about the end of 1857,when a company was formed to work it. They sank a sbaf t to the depth < f 100 feet, and were driven out by the water, which they had not the means to combat. The reef was at a standstill till within the last seven months, when two men started work on it, and have been clearing wages ; but there is no doubt that if a strong company, with capital and good pumping machinery were started, the working of the reef would prove highly remunerative. This reef differs from the other reefs on Tarrengower in this, that it goes down per pendicularly, and has a slate formation on each side of it. Table showing the Yield of Gold from the Tarren- gower Reefs : \u2014 Smith's Reef, North Muckleford.\u2014 This reef was opened about the same time as German Reef, towards the end of October, 1855. It was first disco vered by a person named Smith, who resolved to pros pect the country to the south of Porcupine Flat. Those who first commenced working the reef were Messrs. Smith, Spearing, Bain, and G. Chapman. About 30 claims more were immediately taken up, and marked ; but none of them ever turned out anything like the prospecting claim ; and now the reef is en tirely deserted. The total amount of gold obtained fr-im the prospecting claim did not exceed l,0G0<>z. About May or June, 1857, a party of Welshmen started a 10-horse power stamping-machine, but they were compelled to remove it, in consequence of the poverty of the stuff. One party in the beginning of la^t January obtained 9oz. from three tons of stuff; 1* tas it would have cost too much to have had it carted and crushed at the nearest machine, he had to giv up. Parkins' Reef, Tarrengower. \u2014 This reef is situate about a mile and a half south-west of the township of Maldon, and was first discovered about July or August, 1855, by Mr. Parkins, whose name it now bears. It is now impossible to as-certain what gold was obtained from the prospecting claim, as Mr. Parkins has long left the district ; but this much is known, that 400oz. of gold were obtained from one crushing of 30 tons. It is also pretty generally known that Air. Parkins cleared several thousand pounds b> his claim, but, wishing to leave the neighbourhood, he sold out to Messrs. Lear and Co., for \u00a33 >, by whom tiie claim is now being worked. The depth of the claim is about 190 feet, but it is lot doing much more than clearing expenses. The next payable claim to the north is Messrs. ( ousin and Holmes', and is 4*2 feet in extent and 123 fee deep. In this claim the reef was lost at a depth of 60 feet, and re- mained unpayable till it reached a dep h of 88 feet, when it again began to pay. The claim most re- markable for its richness, however, belongs to Messrs Oswald, Robinson, Bell, and Co. 17oz. of gold to the ton was the largest yield of gold obtained from 12 tons of quartz by Bell and Co. After 18 months* work, and after paying all expenses, Bell and Co. cleared 900oz. There have bepn more unpayable claims on this reef than on any other reef on Tarren- gower up to the present time, but the various claim- holders are sanguine that they will yet prove highly remunerative. There are about 25 claims altogether on this reef and the spur to the westward\u2014 foui of these are registered, and 12 are abandoned. Those of the abandoned claiu.s on tbe spur turned out the richest, when in full work ; but when worked out, or supposed to be so, they were abandoned. Rice and Company have continued to work on amidst almost insurmountable difficulties, but they are confident of ultimate success. Should this be the case, they will have made out a good claim to the rest of the aban doned claims. * On none of the Tarrengower reefs is there such an unusual departure from the north as on this reef. It dips in an irregular manner to the west, and is about 3 feet thick, cased on both sides in schistose reefs. Its course is the most tortuous and crooked of any in the division.

(Ambrose Johnson, Mining Surveyor.) During the past month, although the miners on the whole have been very busy, nothing remarkable or of peculiar interest has occurred. A number of quartz-reefs, mostly previously worked, are being prospected ; but most of the claims have only lately been taken up, and I have not beard of any crushing latelj which would warrant me in ex pressing any opinion. Puddling and sluicing are briskly carried on, and aie, I believe, paying vw> well on an average. Some of the claims taken up during the dry season, I am in formed, have not proved so remunerative as was originally anticipated, but if any of them turned out better i han was expected, it won d probably not be mentioned. Y\\ e had much rain iu the first setting in of the winter, but the water is now getting rather low, and some of the more extensive races have this winter not carried more than one sluice head of water for any length of time. I may here mention that an enterprising party are at present trying to bring the Kangaroo Creek into Wombat\u2014 a speculation which, if carried out, cannot fail to prove profitaole. In tunnelling I have nothing new to report, no new ground having been opened during the month.

St. Andrew's Division. (James Murphy, Mining Surveyor). [From the elaborate population tables supplied by Mr. Murphy, it nppears that there are at Caledonia 88 persons engaged in actual quartz mining, and 11 employed at quartz-mills; in alluvial mining 31 are engaged at puddling-machines, eight at sluicing, \u00abx at tom-washing, and 444 at tub washing. The total at Caledonia is 5b8, and of these 189 are Chinese The Chinese are mostly engaged in tub washing. At An derson's Creek there are nine persons engaged in actual quartz mining, and five are employed at crushing mills ; in alluvial mining eight are employed at pud dling-machines, twoat sluicing, and 33 at tub- washing. The total at Anderson's Creek is 57, and of those 15 are Chinese, mostly engaged in tub-washing. On tbe Aboriginal Reserve, on the right bank of the Yarra, three persons are engaged in quartz-mining, and four in tub-washing. At Dandenong there are 100 mincra at work, by report, and they are engaged in sluicing. Mr. Murphy says \u2014 \"The abo\\e report is the result of actual counting, except as regards the Dandenong gold-field. These ittms >n t' e table which are the result of counting, are, however, liable to an error of defect, because, at the time of my passing through the different parts ef the for the purpose of making notes, it is more than probable that many of the miners were either in their tents or otherwise engaged than on their claims. This is a constant source of error, and always will be. This table may, therefore, be re garded onl,) as an approximation, but with the error in defect. There have been 14 puddling claims, 13 bank and hill sluicing claims, and seven creek sluicing claims, amounting in the aggregate to upwards ot ;i0 acres, besides three tunnel claims and four claims on aban doned quartz reefs, granted during the month of Julv.

The original cut has f .lien in, and two leaders, 4 inches and 0 inches, very irregular, are all that can be seen at present ; but lo judge from the appearance, I think it extremely pro oable that prospecting here would be rewarded.

I am told that some years ago a patch of some 70oz. or 80oz. was washed off the surface in a few day-**, and a spe cimen of considerable richness picked up, where what appears to be the cap of a reef is cropping out on the surtace. This cap has since been uncovered, and a couple of shafts sunk, but with no success, and the ground has since then been abandonee. 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Although the most unsuccessful of our quartz-miners are making more than a living, aid the yield of gold from the Swedish Reef, on One tree Hill, is greater than ever (151b. weight of gold having been extracted from 601b. weight of quartz a few days ago), still there is a decrease in the number of our quartz miners. The claim f om which the above mentioned quart* was taken is, strange to say, being worked very slowly indeed, the cliim being now about 12 months opened, and only sunk to a depth of about 21 feet at the deepest part.

We are occasionally visited by an odd one of a certain class of speculators who are invariably going to work wonders in mining, but have no capital of their own, as the event seems to indicate, for we rarely see them a second time. In alluvial mining there is some increase in the number of persons engaged in that pursuit, notwith standing that there is a very great decrease in the number of Chinese on this gold-fit-ld. and also that Messrs. Clarke and Brown have discontinued the very extensive works projected, and in part executed, at Thomson's Bend, on the Yarra. The cause of the ces sation of the works on this promising undertaking is not known. A new reef has been opened on the right bank of the Back Creek, about one mile and a halt above Queens town, but I have not as yet- ascertained the yield of gold. This is tbe first sten towards prospecting the country lying beyond that creek, where there is a large extent of country between it and the River Plenty, as yet an unknown land to the miners, although it offers a wide field for prospectors, inasmuch, as from the position of the Reedy Creek Reefs, they must be a con tinuation of the same belt of reefs which pass through Anderson's Creek and the Caledonian gold-field. The connecting lines of reefs would, no doubt, he found in that part of the country if properly searched for. At Anderson's Creek, Messrs. Moore and Gerraghty have commenced their tunnelling operations at the Fourth Hill, and are making a cutting about 9 feet wide, which they intend continuing on a level until the face of the cutting is of a sufficient height to admit of a tunnel 6 feet high being formed. So far as they have gone the rock is of a soft purple argillite, alter nating with a soft micaceous sandstone, and thin bands of conglomerate. The strata stand nearly verti cally, and offer great facilities for blasting, so that it is to be hoped that this work will proceed rapidly, and soon yield a well-merited return for both enterprise and out ay. It is the first quartz mining enterprise, properly projected, that has been undertaken in tins division. Dr. Owens is making very rapid progress with his arrangements for puddling at Whipstick Gully. He has his machine set ou its permanent bed, ai.d a pump er- cted capable of supplying water at the rate of 7,700 gallons per hour. The washing-stuff is to be thrown from the carts into a large tank, which receives also the stream of water raised by the pump. From the tank to the machine there is a line of sluice-boxes, through which a complete torrent of water and wash ing-stuff is to pass in a semi-fluid state to the machine. The quantity of stuff washed per day must be greater in amount than has ever been done by any other ma chine, so that, with a much less yield of gold than is to be found in Whipstick Gully, Dr. Owens' method of puddling must be very successful. At that part of the gold-field in the immediate vici nity of Kangaroo Ground, and including the two watery gullies \u2014 Cherry Tree Gully and Ford's Gully \u2014 the yield of gold derived from individual mining and tub- washing is becoming very small and pi ecarious. The diggers are therefore beginning to exhibit a dis position to migrate io other parts of the division. In desoribing the general conformation of this divi sion in a previous report, a very striking feature had forced itself upon my notice at the time, but which I deferred remarking upon until I had had time to ob serve whether this feature -was a general one or not ; and having made very extensive observations, I was greatly struck with the fact that this was general\u2014 that is, that the hills along the right banks of rivers and creeks, and also along the right sides of gullies of any great length, are in all cases very preci pitous, when compared with those along the left banks. If this observation would apply only to rivers and creeks trending southerly, this conformation might possibly be attributed to a disruption caused by some disturbance ; but such is not the case, as this feature is observable in every bearing of trend, but more remarkably so when the trend is westerly. This is a remarkable and, I believe, a signi ticant fact, from which perhaps some useful inference may yet be drawn. [The remainder of the report relates to plans in progress, &c] N0te. \u2014 No reports have been received from Mr. Mining Surveyor Pringle, No. 5 Division, Ballaarat ; Mr. Hart, Sandhurst ; Mr. Shepard, Taradale ; and Mr. Longbottom, Blackwood Division. Another quartz vein has been opened on the east side of the Third Hill. This vein is about 4 inches thick, but shows no g Id as yet. The shaft is sunk to a depth of 7 feet, through a hard grey sandstone,alter nating with argillite, mica schist, and thin bands of shaly argillaceous sandstone. Increased facilities fer extracting gold from quartz are about to be afforded us by Mr. Wilkinson, who is erecting one of his patent calcining furnaces, with some improvements, at Anderson's Creek. He does not attempt extracting the gold by smelting alone, as heretofore, but after the quartz has been sufficiently calcined, it is then to be submitted to the process of crushing, in a suitable Chilian mill. This I regard as a very material improvement in the pro cess, and from the state to which the quartz is to be reduced before crushing, 1 must say that anyone ac quainted with the details of gold extraction must be very sanguine of its success. If this process succeed (and it seems to me pretty certain that it will), this goldfield must, within a very short period, become tbe leading quartz district of the colony. All that is wanted here is a cheap extraction of gold from quartz, and the investment of a comparatively moderate amount of capital. The supply of quartz is without limit.

Lead, have sold their claims and machinery, &<?., and new companies have purchased and commenced work ing them. No. 1 Division. (Robert Davidson, Mining Surveyor.) Of the Malakoff and Milkman's Leads I have no thing new to report \u2014 the several companies thereon are working steadily with moderate success. I have the honour to report that during the past month a great number of claims have been taken possession of within this division of the district, under the new By-law X. of the Mining Board. If capital be brought to bear on our gold-fields, and companies for the employment of such capital be foimed upon proper bases, gold-mining will, as it should, be reduced to a system ; and there cannot be a doubt that our gold-fields will prove far more profit able, or at any rite more permanently profitable, than they have been hitherto. With reference to the several leads in this division, I have the honour to report that tbe labours of the several companies on the Inkermann Lead have been attended with very satisfactory results, although, in consequence of a large influx of water from the rock, their works were stopped for several days. This is the third time they have been flooded out. and each time a considerable amount of damage has been done to their drives, in addition to the loss of time, &c. In order to pi event a recurrence of these floods, the several companies subscribed for the purchase and erection of a steam-engine, for the purpose of drain ing out the rock, but though the engine has been erected for some months, it does not appear to afford an effectual remedy. Golden Point Lead.\u2014 With reference to this lead, I have to report that the Cosmopolitan Company and the Koh-i-noor Company are at length reaping a reward for their long and arduous labours, and, from present appearances, they anticipate great resu Its, the shareholders in the latter company having about \u00a328 per man for about six days ; but, inasmuch as these companies have been engaged in sinking and driving since the early part of the year 1857, during which period they have expended considerable sums of money in the purchase of machinery, &c, without any return, I fear that, after reimbursing themselves for that outlay, they will not realise very large profits, unless the yield be extraordinary. The Homeward Bound Company on the Golden Point Lead, and the Telegraph Company on the Nightingale Township Quartz- Reef\u2014 Respecting this reef I have to report that a company, consisting of share holders, has been organised, and is now busily engaged in erecting crushing machinery in a very substantial and superior manner, and if the machinery be as effi cient as is promised, I have no doubt that the com pany will prove a very great success, as there is every reason lo believe that they possess in their claim a large body of highly auriferous quartz. In the neigh bourhood of the Milkman's Lead a party known as the Havilah Company took possession of an abandoned tunnel, *\u00abhich had been put in some 230 feet from the face of the hill ; at a distance of about 220 feet along this tunnel they sank a shaft to the deptn of 60 feet, and after driving a further distance of CO feet, struck what I believe to be a continuation of the Township Quartz Reef. The quality of the quartz has not yet been fairly tested. Campbell's Diggings.\u2014 SinJemy last report I have the honour to state that gold in paying quantities has been discovered on the side of a hill about three-quarters of a mile from the scene of the first rush. Some of the miners are of opinion that a lead will be discovered in that locality, as some of the shafts are 50 feet deep, and show no sign of a bottom. Until several shafts are bottomed it is impossible to form any opinion on the subject. A large company is about to be formed, under the title of the \"Great River Company, \"for the purpose of taking up about a mile of the main lead, which will probably be formed by the junction of the Golden Point, Redan, Frenchman's, and Inkermann Leads. I forward herewith a series of sections of shaftB on the Inkermann Lead, made out in the form suggested by you. I will send a plan showing the position of each shaft, in a few days.

I am at present engaged in preparing a ground plan and section of part of my dis trict, which I shall be able to send by the 18th of this month, Since my last report a marked improvement has taken p. ace in my district, chiefly in respect to the foru-ation of large companies for the purpose of work ing the numerous quartz-reefs that are known to exist, and for the purpose of carrying on large steam puddling operations. Surfacing. \u2014 Bye-law No. X. of the Mining B> ard has given a decided impetus to mining in this district, in consequence of the very large areas of ground allowed to the holders of miners' rights under this regulation. The large amount of 126\u00a3 acres have been taken up as surfacing claims, the greater part of which will be washed in puddling-machines. In Little Bendigo alone (a small corner of the Division, comprising an area of no more than 250 acres) Chere are 56 puddling machiDes continually at work, and in consequence of a Pew company having been established, with a 1 arge amount of capital, I expect to see a greater amount of machinery on the ground before the expiration of a month. The number of men who have taken up sur facing in the month of August amounts to 167, and the number of puddling-machines erected to 26. On old ground there have been fewer claims taken up than in any previous month\u2014 25 men only being en gaged, and the area occupied by them amounts to 31,250 superficial feet. The companies, for the most part, have not yet commenced washing operations ; but wnen they are fairly at work, a great improvement will, no doubt, be found in the yield of gold. The chief improvement noticeable in my district since my last report is in quartz-mining, which branch of industry is every day attracting more attention in proportion as the net hods and cost of working be come more generally known. The development of the resources ol this gold-field, as well as those of most others, is dependent upon the amount of practical ability brought to bear upon the details of an operation, combined with the necessary capital for carrying out in a systematic manner the improvements that experience has taught. The miners are now, for the most part, trained to co-operation : they are accustomed to act as a body and submit to equitable rules drawn up by them, selves. Quartz.\u2014 In consequence of a new reef, called the Yorkshire Reef, having been discovered, quartz-mi ning is now engaging the attention of the minerB of Ballaarat, and in this division particularly far more than heretofore. To this may be added the increased facility for obtaining gold from quartz by theintroduc tion of machinery, and the fact of the greater part of the alluvial ground in the district having been already taken up. To give an idea of tbe value of some of the reefs in this division, I may instance one claim on the Black Hill of an area of 57 feet along tbe course of the reef, by 300 feet in width. The owners of this claim, I may safely assert, would not sell their title to it for a sum of \u00a350,000. 1 am glad that therichnesB of some of our reefs has called into circulation some of the dormant capital of Melbourne, and I am confi dent that in a short time Ballaarat will be found to be as rich in quartz as is well known it has been in allu vial workings. Four thousand feet along the course of the reef have been taken up during the month of It is quite evident that without some preliminiry training cooperative companies could not be carried out at all ; and even with it, there is but little doubt that a system of contract would be found in the end to be more effective, and consequently cheaper. There are, however, a large number of co-operative companies in existence, which, on the whole, work very well.

On the Gum Tree Flat the Llanberries Company have commenced stamping, with a good prospect, but so little woik has yet been done that I am unable to state the yield from the quartz. The lode was struck some three years ago at a depth of 120 feet, and a large number of rich speci mens were obtained. Claims have now been taken up for a longdistance, and should the quartz be found to turn out as well as expected, a very large number of men will find employment. At the present time there are two engines on the ground, and five claims have been taken up. The same lode is also being pro spected for by several other parties, as the general opinion is, that it will be found to take a direction to wards the Black-hill. One party has already struck it on the northern side of the road, and on the southern, towards the Golden Point Reef, two parties are at work prospecting. A quartz lode has also been worked for some time at a short distance to the eastward of the one on the Gumtree Flat. (See No. 40 on plan.) This lode is found within 16 feet of the surface, and the parties have gained a good liveli hood by simply washing the quartz with a tub and cradle. They have now made arrangements for the erection of a battery of eight stamps, by tne aid of which they expect to increase their earnings to a considerable extent. This lode is of far greater width than any that has been struck yet on Ballaarat, as in many places it has been known to spread out to a width of 20 feet, In the neighbourhood of Canadian (No. 19 on plan) a quartz claim, measuring 2,100 feet in length, has been taken up by 42 men. The party intend to prospect the lode, and in the event of its proving payable they will erect machinery for crushing. Not long since a lode was struck by Wagg and party in the Bame neighbourhood, from which a large number of specimens have been obtained. Considerable difference of opinion exists as to the best method of amalgamating, the con trivances employed for the purpose being different in almost every claim. It is also observable that the same apparatus that is condemned by one party is approved by another, after a number of trials ; the different results being probably attributable to the manner in which the amalgamating tables have been fixed and worked. In employing amalgamating tables, one thing is essential to a successful result \u2014 namely, a uniform, steady motion. Where the speed varies, the amalgam is always lost, and tables are often condemned as useless when the fault arises simply from the imperfect manner in which the machinery has been adjusted. It is also to be observed, that at the present time the method of working quartz clain s is very unscientific. The lode is usually taken out, and a large vacant space left, which, in many in stances, has caused the claim to become dangerous to work in, and has prevented a large quantity of quartz from being taken out. I have no doubt, however, that as experience is gained quartz-working will be carried on in a more scientific manner, and proper precautions taken to secure the ground as the lode is worked. due economy and skill. Money is expended, and ma chinery erected, very often with the greatest want of caution, and it is only when the capital has been expended that the shareholders begin to know how the operation might have been made profitable. By this time the public has lost all confidence in the undertaking, and it fre quently happens that a second party steps in and reaps the benefit of the work done by the first. At tbe present time, when so much attention is being given to the formation of large companies, it may be as well to point out the uncertainty ofmining operations, and more especially of quartz-mining. The obtaining ot a few specimen*? from the top of a lode does not preve that the lode will pay for a large operation. I would recommend that before any expense is gone to in erecting machinery for quartz-crushing, the lode should be thoroughly tested by the sinking of a shaft to a depth of at least 150 feet. From various depths samples of quartz should be taken and crushed, and the operations con tinued or suspended according to the results obtained Unless lomething of this kind is done thousands of pounds will be thrown away in erecting machinery on valueless lodes ; shareholders will lose their money, and gold-mining be looked upon as an unprofitable employment, when the fault lies rather in the reckless way in wnich companies are formed, than in the ab sence of paying quartz or alluvial ground. Prelimi nary expenses should also be carefully looked after by the shareholders, as in many instances a large portion of the capital of a company is expended in the pay ment of salaries and other expenses before a p ck is put into the ground, or a single step taken in the practical working. There is undoubtedly a large field for the investment of capital in legitimate mining operations, but the formation of companies in a reckless manner, aui the misleading of the public by carefully-drawn -up prospectuses, can only lead to loss to the shareholders and a mistrust in all gold-fields operations whatever. In conclusion, I beg to inform your Honourabe Board that I am at present engaged in preparing a large plan of my district, upon the compilation of which I shall be able to forward every month sections, as required by your instructions. The reason why I have not forwarded with my pre sent report the sections required by the instructions of your Honourable Board is that I am engaged at the present time compiling the plan above-mentioned, by means of which I shall be able to afford full and reli able information upon all points of interest within my district.

The gaining belies in the benefits to be derived from working on a large scale has led to the formation of several companies, and there appears to be every pro bability of an increase of their number. There can be no doubt that there is a large quantity of ground in my district that will pay for proper working ; but it must be remembered thit the carrying out of a suc cessful mining operation requires much attention, kill and discrimination.

Staffordshire Quartz- Reef. \u2014As far as can yet be judged of, this reef promises very well. The yield generally has been found satisfactory, and in two or three instances highly so. As much as 2^ot. to the ton has been obtained from some 76 or 80 tons lately crushed. The population in the neighbourhood is steadily increasing. Two large quartz prospecting claims have been taken up during the month about half a mile to the southward, where it is thought by some experienced quartz-miners another payable reef is likely to be discovered. Some encouraging pros pects have in both instances been obtained from the outcrop, so that I think the place bids fair to be well tested. Two other parties are about to take up quartz prospecting claims between the Staffordshire Reef and the Whim Holes ; but I have not yet surveyed them, and therefore can only Btate what the persons themselves told me\u2014 namely, that the prospects in both cases were very encouraging. One company, however, known as the Red Jacke*-, are still engaged ahead of the junction, and claim tJ be entitled to an equal share in the after junction gutter with the opposite party on the Frenchman's. This company took up their ground in April, 1856, when it was not anticipated that the junction of the two leads would take place inside their claim ; and having been in possession ever since, and having expended several thousand pounds in the purchase of machinery, &c, they are now resolved to claim an equal right with the others to the united gutters which bear the name of the Senior Lead (Frenchman's). On the other hand, the company registered for the Frenchman's Lead contend that the Red Jacket Company should have no right or claim whatever to the after-junction gutter, as the White Horse Lead ceased to exist as soon as it joined the Frenchman's, and thenceforward they claim to be the exclusive owners of the conjoined gutters. Thus matters stand at present, and in all likelihood will continue for some months longer, until the parties succeed in reaching the long and anxiously sought for gutter, when veiy probably they will at once resort to the expensive and otten ruinous process of litigation, instead of the simple measure\u2014 arbitration. No. 5, OR BUNINYONG, DIVISION. (James W. R. Pringle, Mining Surveyor.) Frenchman's and Cobbler's Leads.\u2014 There is nothing worthy of record respecting these leads since my last report. The Long Funnel Company, on the latter, is still the only one working on the gutter, the yield of which, I fear, will not afford them much over the ordinary rate of wages (their actual cash expenses being deducted) for the time employed in working it out, to say nothing of some two years' preliminary labour ex pended on the work of sinking tne shaft. With an improved system of wori ing, coupled with such large areas of ground as are allowed by the present Mining Board Regulations, I am confident that the deep rock leads in this neighbourhood would be found to yield highly satisfactory returns, both to the capitalist and working miner, though hitherto, I am sorry to say, the reverse has been almost invariably the ca~*e. Judging from the general disposition late y evinced by mining companies to have their shafts sunk by contract or hired labour, I am of opinion that the results will be found far more satisfactory tnan under the old co operative system of mining. Whim Holes Lead.\u2014 This lead is now totally aban doned, with the exception of one large prospecting claim lately taken up by a company, about half a mile down the gully, where the lead is supposed to run. The party are boring for the deep ground, and getting the work done by hired labour. They are about to register under the Limited Liability Act, and are likely to give the place a fair trial. So that if, as is generally supposed, the precious metal exists in payable quantities in the Dlace, they are pretty cer tain to open up a good field. The probable depth is 130 feet to 140 feet, and all through clay or drift\u2014 the basaltic rock not extending so far \u2014 a circumstance which considerably adds to the party's chance of being ultimately remunerated for then- labour and outlay. Paddy's Gully.\u2014 This place, as well as the neighbour ing gullies, are almost entirely abandoned, the mining population having been drawn away from them by the superior attractions of Brown's, Lucky Woman's, aud other places in No. 6 Division. It is tolerably certain that this portion of my district will ultimately be found as worthy of the miner's attention as any of the places above named ; but in consequence of its remote situation and the great expense and difficulty of getting the requisites for mining purposes conveyed to the ground, I fear it will be some time before it re ceives the attention it deserves. There have been two old ground claims recently taken up about half a mile north of Paddy's Gully, and it is expected that a new lean is likely to be discovered in one of them. Italian Gully. \u2014 The lower, or northern, portion of this gully, in the vicinity of the Black Ball Lead, pre sents just now a very active and busy appearance, and it is thought the place will ere long become one of the most prosperous in the neighbourhood. The Black Lead itself is likely to turn out very well judging from On the 10th ult. a payable gutter was made by the Old Black Lead Mining Compauy, on the Black Lead, having apparently its source in the Chalk HUls (marked R on plan). In consequence of this the com pany has had an extension of ground beyond the area represented on the plan forwarded last month, and four other companies have, under Bye-law 10, taker possession of the remaining ground on the suppose* course of this gutter, as far as the Chalk Hills, a plan of which I have the honour to submit in connection with this report. By referring to Shaft No. 4 on my section of the Black Lead, the depth and the various strata gone through will be seen. No one of the other companies has as yet bottomed on the wash-dirt, but the course of the gutter has been proved almost to a certainty by boring. Until one or more shafts have been sunk I will be unable to give any section of the gutter. I am informed that the average yield of gold hitherto obtained has been about 3oz. to 100 cubic feet of earth. Considerable interest is now being taken in the Durham Lead on account of the anticipated junction with the Scotchman's Lead, which up to the present time bas been entirely worked by private companies, from whom, under the existing state of mining on private property, I have no means of obtaining re liable information. Several companies on the Durham have, where practicable, taken advantage of the extended areas allowed in Bye- law 10, so that in future the prospect of fair remuneration is much enhanced, and the working of this lead will doubtless be conducted with more energy than has yet been displayed. There are only twu companies now working on the Napoleon Lead (marked X), one party having aban doned the claim, owing to the great depth and conse quent expense. Neither of the present companies has as yet struck the gutter, but are working steadily, and with every indication of ultimate suc cess. No other shafts have been bottomed, nor has any- thing of consequence occurred during the month on any of the other leads in this district. Very little attention has for some time past been paid to quartz-mining, several companies having abandoned their ground for the reefs at Italian and adjacent gullies. At the present time I cannot esti- mate the men so engaged at over 100, and those not, upon an average, reali.ing above \u00a32 sterling per man per week. On the old and abandoned ground a great many persons.who could avail themselves of Bye law 10 tiave taken up claims, and though in most instances the extreme areas allowed are injurious to the general public in this district, on tbe majority of the deep leads abandoned, these extended areas are particularly applicable. On new and shallow ground dissatisf action has been expressed at the great areas allowed by this"], [77, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 7 bye-law, but more so at one man's being allowed to hold 12 claims by virtue of one miner's right.

The population is as follows:\u2014 The following Table shows the ground in occu- pation :\u2014 With the view of bringing this rapidly advancing section of our gold-fields into public notice, as well as for the elucidation of my reports thereon, I have ar ranged to take the district into sub-divisions of conve nient extent and character to enable me to forward each month, with the usual general report, a more particular description, accompanied with a map, of one of the.e sub-diviiions. Carngham, the locality which I have selected for especial consideration for the present, lies to the west ward of Smythesdale, and is distant from it about eight miles. The intervening country, for six miles at least, consists of abrupt quartz ridges of slight elevation, trending in a south-easterly direction, and nearly equi-distant from both, is a large dividing xange, forming a kind of anticlinal axis, from whence the country gradually slopes on either side to the auriferous vaUey of Smythesdale and Carngham, the extreme limits of its opposite inclina tion. Within IJ miles of the valley of Carngham, the barren schistose ranges suddenly terminate at the margin of the beautiful and extensive tract of agri cultural land which stretches to the north and north west towards Burrumbeet and Mount Emeu, and as far as Snake Valley on the south, where it is contracted into a narrow strip on the flank of the Hard Hill at Linton's. The vast region towards Burrumbeet and Mount Emeu, north of the township, being outside tha boundary of the mining district, I have not had occasion to extend my researches in that direction, but I believe it to be an extension of the trap forma tion which covers almost entirely the valley ef Carngham, extending to the east and west dividing range, known as the Hard Hill, along the line of the leaseholds, which are supposed to be on the course of the Snake Valley Lead. The source from whence this prodigious quantity of molten matter has issued is very obviously discernable towards the eastern fence of Mr. Russell's private pro perty, in the shape of a large truncated hill. Its posi tion I have laid down on the accompanying map. At the base of the hill there are two claims of 400,000 superficial feet each, taken up under the mining regu lations. One of these, by the Cairngorm Company, has already been sunk to the depth of 130 feet, through scoriae, which has not as yet been passed through. I have examined specimens of it taken from various The following table shows the machinery : \u2014 Two engines .are idle, .and two are employed at saw mills. tTwo engines are idle.

Toe companies mining on the private property, and whose shafts I have marked on the map, being exempt from the operation of the mining regulations, my means of obtaining information from them is more circumscribed. However, general repute\u2014 the cor rectness of which I have not heard challenged\u2014 ascribes to them no meaner dividends than from \u00a315 to \u00a330 per man weekly, and sometimes more. The shallow diggings at and around Carngham, once famously rich, are nearly exhausted. There are, how ever, a good many still deriving the means of sub sistence from surfacing, and from some of the shallow gullies ; they chiefly consist of Chinese. The sub joined table will show the number of puddling machines engaged. A crushing -machine is in course of erection in connection with the quartz-reef. Upon a review of the whole, I am Btrongly of opinion that Carngham will soon become a most flourishing locality. The richness of the mines, the superior capabilities of the soil, and the fixity of the tenure of claims, whether on the lands of the Crown or not, together with their size, supply at once all the chief elements of prosperity. Linton's.\u2014 With the exception of a few Chinese parties surfacing on the Hard Hills and shallow end of the old gullies, there are few others besides those connected with leases, or those engaged on tho Standard Lead. The Standard Lead, the first proclaimed on the frontage Bystem at Linton's, was discovered on the 1st of August last. On the 6th, and within a week after, 49 claims were registered. At present there are nine shafts bottomed on it, and upon the whole with very satisfactory results. No. 6 have got wash-dirt which has turned out 8 oz. to the cubic yard. Until the announcement of this return the companies a-head of No. 9 were very dilatory in their movements, but since then they are progressing vigorously. I in tend making this quarter the subject of particular notice in my next report. I shall forward therewith a map showing the position and extent of the several claims, and other gold-workings in the locality. depths, and I find very little diversity in its con sistency. , The party have been obliged to suspend further sinking until they have erected a steam-engine. I shall watch the proceedings of this party with peculiar interest, and report whatever interesting features their operations may disclose. The dividing-range before alluded to, forming what is called the Linton's Hard Hill, is about one mile in width, where it forms the natural barrier between Linton's and Carngham. It has been remarkable for very rich deposits of gold, and its surfacing capabilities would add materially to our products could there be a sufficient supply of water obtained for puddling purposes. The Snake Valley Lead, Rock Lead, and others of less distinct on, all take their rise in this remarkable range, and, pursuing a northerly course, fall into the ancient river now being worked within tbe private property. The present valley along the worked-out diggings would seem to be reduced to its present depressed level by the degrading action ot the water-sheds of she locality, which have a rapid fall from the Hard Hill. Through this opening into the Emeu Creek, the united waters then take a circuitous sweep to the west and south, until they.fall into the Woady Yallock Creek, at the extreme south boundary of the mining district, where the creek also receives the drainage of Linton's, through the numerous tri butary channels and gullies which rise at or near the base of the Hard Hill adverted to. The ancient river-bed is about 1,000 feet to the east ward of the present. IU precise course has been as certained by several mining companies, who are now extracting gold from it ; and its probable continuation would seem to be through the private property of Mr. Stone, into the Crown land south of the Cairngorm claim, beyond which the flat sameness of the country would hardly warrant an opinion as to its probable course with any regard to precision. You will perceive by reference to the map that all the leads on Crown lands are in occupation under the leasing regulations. None of them have been granted yet, notwithstand ing some of the claims have been bottomed since the applications were lodged, and others are making active preparations upon the faith of their applications being granted. About 6 miles to the southward of Linton's are the shallow diggings of Happy Valley and Lucky Woman's, &c. The latter place has acquired within the last mx or eight months a prosperous pre-emi nence, exceedingly rich patches being frequently found. The expenses were really insignificant, the ground being shallow and dry. Except on occasions of encroachment, I am very sel dom called upon to exercise my professional functions in that quarter, the shallow nature of the ground here tofore excepting it from the necessity of registration, so that I have no authentic data respecting the yields, but mere observation affords proof that it has been, and will in all likelihood continue to be, a thriving community. Smythesdale. \u2014 Since my last report the whole of the remaining portion of ground on the course of the main lead, known as Roxborough and Warren's, which traverses the entire extent of Smythesdale, has been taken up in block claims under Bye-Law No. X of the Mining Board, which came into force on the 16th of last month. The number and extent of these blocks are tabulated on the subjoined statistical return. The inadequacy of the size of claims has been hitherto felt in this district as the greatest restriction to mining enterprise, the difficulty and expense of testing the greatei por tion of the district being so immoderately above what the areas would justify ; as a consequence hundreds of acres lie unexplored, which under the present liberal Bystem have been seized upon with avidity. Clause 10 of this bye law, which enables any. person holding a miner's right to take up 12 claims, provided that the number of men employed upon such claims be equal to the number of claims so taken possession ot, has elicited some murmurings of discon tent on the part of a great number of miners ; but The first of these claims, on the Snake Valley Lead, is the Ancient Briton Company's (of 5 acres), wh\u00a9 have not yet commenced work. Next in succession is the Prince of Wales, who have been getting gold Beveral weeks back. Their machinery consists of a whim and puddling-machine ; their returns are very good \u2014 the height of wash-dirt is about 4 feet. Next adjoining is the Great Britain, 10 acres, and Sherwood, acres. both at present engaged sinking. Next comes the Red Lion, of 8 acres ; bottomed, and doing well. They have an engine and puddling-machine. Next, the Bedfordshire, of 10 acres, and the Roy Roy, of 8 acres\u2014 the former is blasting through the rock, which is here exceedingly compact, and the latte : have only just commenced. This brings the leaseholders on the Snake Valley Lead into close proximity with those on the Rock Lead, at the extreme west end of which is situated the Southern Cross lease of 5 acres. This party have been on wash-dirt for some considerable time back, but their success has not been as yet very great. Their machinery is a whim and puddling macbine. The Cosmopolitan Company adjoins the latter. They have not bottomed ; their claim is 5 acres. The Gnome, of 12 acres, bounds the Cosmo politan. They have an engine at work. No gold has been struck by them yet. The Magnum Bonum adjoins this claim. The Company have discontinued work, awaiting the arrival of machinery. The Comet, of 10 acres, have nearly bottomed their second shaft. The Baron Clyde, of five acres, have also ceased working. Their shaft is partially sunk. Adjoining the Baron Clyde is the United Miners, of 20 acres, and the lease claim of Powell and party, of 20 acres. Neither of these two last have yet commenced."], [79, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 9 whilst I concede that in some instinc3s such a privi- lege may allure to unfair speculation, I am confident that th a good effects of it will more than counterbalance its shortcomings, and that if properly conducted it would be the means of conferring an incalculable benefit on the mining community. In the first instance it would confer on the capitalist a'l the advantages he could obtain from the leasing system in the matter of area, without being burthened wiih the heavy rent or the restrictive stipulations of the latter ; and in the second.it enables any individual miner to take up a claim sufficient for himself and party, the selection of which would be in his own power. Should theparty when thus chosen agree to have their authority over the claim co-ordinate, they have only to present their miners' rights, and get registered, and that simple act of registration would make them so. Numberless failures, especially on the frontage leads, have hap- pened, in companies being denied this right of selec- tion, by which they could insure competent working men and preclude tbe admission of the many inca- pables which the chance afforded by indiscriminate re- gistration buttoooften foisted on the real working man. Another advantage resulting from it consists in its making it imperative to have all claims registered that exceed 300 superficial feet per man. A regular and uninterrupted record of all claims can he thus secured \u2014their position and extent can be more easily defined and connected, and the positions of all shafts whether trial shafts or otherwise, whether on the reeforgutter, accurately noted, together with the stratifications passed through ; new ideas may be educed, and infor mation evolved which may lead to important dis coveries. tained an additional quantity of ground. Their old claim had been nearly worked. The Reliance Company, who occupy a considerable portion of tbe frontages of the late abandoned Bri tanni* Lead, have lately struck a small auriferous drift : \u00bbta extent and quality are, however, as yet problematical. The Perseverance, Abandoned Junction, Great Eastern, and Great Western are deriving fair returns. None of these companies presents any new incidents for the month. The Beaumont Company (lease) have got through the rock, and are engaged erecting an engine. The Caledonian Company have been squaring their boundaries below with their neighbours, the Newcastle Company. From the accident of some pent-up waters in the superior drifts having forced a passage into their drives, on account of tbe subsidence of the superincumbent strata, the drives became inundated to such an excess, that no underground work could be prosecuted for a fortnight : they have now, how- ever, resumed. The Newcastle Company have Obtained a block claim under the new regulations. On the western side of Smythe's Creek several block claims have been taken up within the last month. The whole of Fraser's Hill is now given under the new bye-law for sluicing. On the Red, White, and Blue the frontage share- holders have all left, with the exception of the pro- specting party, but the abandoned ground has been taken possession of by other panies. The block claims taken up on the presumption that an unexplored run of auriferous ground from the south eastern side of Fraser's Hill intersected the old lead in the claim marked 3-4, have been, after an abor- tive trial, deserted. Brown's scarcely presents any new features during the month, with the exception of a few block claims taken up under the new code, merely on speculation. The North Briton Lead ia still paying as well as ever ; the ground is being rapidly worked out, and with it will terminate the last of these well-known leads, which have obtained for this locality such a wide-spread notoriety. The Grand Junction (lease) are doing better than usual. The Great Britain, and their adversaries (the Anti Leasers), are obliged to suspend work, being under the ban of an injunction. The Hand-in-Hand (lease) have not yet reached the gutter, but are in daily expectation of it. The Red Hill Company, next in succession, have withdrawn their application for a lease, and havo taken up the ground, with the addition under Bye-law X. They are in a forward state with their second shaft. The Mines Royal (lease) are labouring hard to reach the gutter. The Reliance Prospecting Companyhave commenced Their claim is bounded on the west by private allot- ment No 1, Scarsdale. There are several other private property allotments from that to Brown's station, fronting the eastern side of the creek, which stand well for leads of gold. The owners of some of these are at present engaged organising mining companies. On the Black Hill Lead nothing has transpired within the month beyond a few alterations and en- largements of claims, and some numerical accessions to the list of the Block Claim registration. The same remark nearly applies to the Oldham Lead at the southern base ot the Black Hill. The frontage claims there have been relinquished by thier owners, who have availed themselves of the privileges allowed by the recent regulations. In the Italian Gully division the old ground and sur facing parties in Monkey, Patterson's, Sawpit, and other smaller gullies have taken advantage of the long continued wet weather, storing themselves with sup plies of water. They have constructed dams and re servoirs, which will supply them for a considerable period of the summer season. with reference to the moro extensive companies, the first is the Hartly, near the junction of Monkey That portion of the main lead taken up on the frontage system has not as yet answered general ex pectation, not more than six claims having as yet yielded any considerable returns ; yet some few who have struck upon good patches are doin? uncom monly well ; but the numbers are too small to give the lead a character. Nuggets of from loz. to 22oz. are occasionally found in some claims, whilst the neighbouring* claims may be getting nothing at all. The inference is that the inequality of distribu tion has arisen from the unevenness of the bottom, being what is usually termed in mining parlance a succession of crabholes. The auriferous ground hitherto met with is on the north end of the lead, excepting claims numbered 3 and 4 on the south, which have litely yielded payable gold. It is now presumed from facts disclosed by the sinking of several shafts that the payable ground lies more to the eastward. This will entail further delay and ex penditure, which will be felt the more ;n consequence of the smallness of the claims. The present frontage bye-law was not in existence at the date of the procla mation of the lead. The Argyle Lead, which possesses many of the peculiarities of the main lead, which it inter sects, especially as regards its indefinable width and irregularity of yield, has within the last few days shown more hopeful symptoms, No. 30 having struck some heavy gold. The Crown Lead has not yet been traced outside the prospecting claim. The other companies are engaged placing an engine. Should it be found to pay as well as the Pioneer Claim, from which it proceeds, it will pay well, Since my last report, two other gullies have been opened to the eastward of the main lead, into which they are falling ; both are now taken up, and are held as block claims. The first claim bottomed on the most northerly of them (the Eldorado Gully) got 3 dwt to the tub ; a yield which has stimulated to great exertion all throughout the several claims. The next gully, named the Montrose, is also occu pied, but nothing definite in respect of yield can as yet be reported on ; but good things are anticipated. The company are erecting a portable six-horse power engine on their shaft, less effectual appliances having been tried to exhaust the water and failed. The Old Britannia Company (Warrens) have ob- B"], [80, "10 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. and Long Gullies. This company have sunk two shafts. They are now a considerable*- depth in the second, and it is hoped will open up fresh treasures in a comparatively unexplored district. This party comprises 16 men, who have 20.00J superficial feet each. Next is the Morning Star (lease). They have sunk three shafts, in none of which did they find deep ground. They are still persevering with unabated confidence in their ultimate success. The Falcon Company (lease) have got a 16-horse power engine at work. They have tried with 100 gallon tanks to reduce the water, but failed, and are about now substituting pumps : the depth i1** 95 feet. The Haverlock Company (lease) are progressing rapidly with their machinery ; another fortnight will find them at work again : they are down 120 feet. The Prince of Wales Company are swamped at a depth of 143 feet. They have \"a claim for 24 men, under Bye-law X. They are getting up a steam-engine of 16-horse power. The Cambrian Company have taken a block claim, adjoining the Prince of Wales, which extends as far as the pre-emptive right of Mr. Brown : work com menced. The next company is the Star of the North, con- sisting of 18 men. Their claim, lately converted into a block claim under Bye law X, was originally given as a prospecting claim in Maich last, since which time they have continued working it without intermission ; but their progress had been very slow, the opposition of the water being too powerful for the limited efforts of manual labour unaided by steam power This last desideratum is now supplied, and will be ready in a few days to ply its force against the foe, which it is hoped it will quickly vanquish. Abutting this claim come the parallels of the Black Ball Lead, on the frontage system. The prospects of this lead as respects the yield are encouraging ; but the besetting evil of our former mining regulations\u2014 namely the insufficiency of area\u2014 leaves it a problem of doubtful calculation whether it will ultimately prove an object of profit or loss to those connected with it. As there are no other frontage leads in the Italian division, the subjoined table, referring to the number and extent of claims under that heading, refers to it exclusively. At the head of the Frontage Lead, and in close con- formity to the first frontage, there are block claims given under the former rules. Some of the parties are doing well. The Perseverance Company, of 16 men, the Admiral Nelson, of 16 men, the Duke of Wellington, of 16 men, and the White Star, of 16 men. are all in different stages of progress : these, with the Haswell of eight men, brings me to the south-eastern boundary of the district. The Long-thought-about Company is at present in a very languishing condition. A good many parties have deserted it, and the few that remain will be soon worked out. I apprehend, from present appearances, there are very little hopes of its being revived, or of anything occurring on it to save it from being classed in the voluminous category of failures. The New World Prospecting Company have bot tomed. The west boundary of the claim is cotermi nous with the east boundary of Biown's pre-emptive right. Their depth is 150 feet. On the east tide of the last-mentioned claim is tbe Mornin<r Light Claim. The shaft in thi-i is 204 feet deep, and at this depth they struck a drift. They then drove a bore hole, and found that they touched quartz boulders, which circumstance, taken in account with the great depth, affords strong presumptive grounds for sup posing them to have struck upon the continuation of the ancient river the course of which is being now explored along the present Black Ball Lead. They nave also found black argillaceous clay, thickly im pregnated with decayed vegetable matter, to a depth of 50 feet. 1 here are 24 men in the party. They have purchased suitable machinery, which is on the way to Us destination. Bounding the latter claim, to the eastward, is the Monte Christo Company's claim. They have bottomed two shafts on the opposite reefs, From the experience acquired under these past trials, they have been enabled to determine the proper position for the present one, which has already reached a depth of 90 feet. The company are as yet confined to the exertions of manual labour, but they are negotiating for the proper machinery. Other claims are bottomed convenient to this, far away on the northern reef, which have yielded lOoz. or 12oz. to the load. The strata passed through so far corresponds with that of the Morning Light, with Blight differences iu thickness and intensity of colour. There are 24 men in the party holding a claim of 480,000 superficial feet. Next adjoining the Monte Christo is the Argo Com pany ; they have bottomed a second shaft, and, although not on the gutter, have found wash-dirt capable of turning out loz. to the load. They have however, met with the fate of the other company, and have had to submit to a temporary cessation of labour to provide an engine. There are 16 men in this party. North-east of this claim is the Prince of Wales (lease) of 20 acres. This party have made repeated efforts to find the deep ground, but have not yet suc ceeded. They are now sinking near the north-east boundary. The Cornish Company (lease) are nearly similarly situated as the last. The have found the greater portion of their claim to be too shallow, and will have to depend on a narrow strip along the line of the north-western boundary. The remaining portion of what is deemed auriferous ground on the north side of these leaseholds has been taken up in block claims under the new regulations, and comprises the Kossuth Company of 24 men, Hotspur of 12 men, Fermosa of 16 men, and Alston of 20 men, all of which parties are carrying on operations with no varying incidents from the ordinary economy. Creswick Division. (James Stevenson, Mining Surveyor.) I have the honour to forward my report for the Clunes division of my district, and amap of the same, on which I have marked the position of the various workings, with sectional drawings. I have also attached an index to the plan to facilitate reference and explain the same. The district is divided by the Tullarook Creek, and on the northern hill \u2014 on the table land above the basin in which Clunes proper is built\u2014 are the more important workings. The main feature of importance is the quartz mining. There are five quartz mining and crushing com panies at present in full operation, having a total of 74 stamps \u2014 one company with 24 stampers being stopped, pending an alteration in their machinery. There are besides six other quartz-mining companies in course of formation. There are alluvial workings on each side, viz. :\u2014 12 companies on the Northern Hill 'and 7 on the Southern Hill, in full operation. The workings, result?, and progress of these com panies I shall state in detail. The total value of mining plant I estimate at \u00a355,765. The number of men engaged at mining is 666 ; horses, constantly. 40 ; whims, 17 ; puddling machines, 22 ; large cradles, 14 ; funs, 10; the total engine power at present hei e is 256 horse. A.

This lode is 12 feet wide at the cap. The stone is very white, with tints of red, salmon, and blue ; and some fine specimens have been found in it. There has been one shaft sunk on this vein, which went down with a slip of the surface, caused by the alluvial workings. Another shaft is being sunk.

No. 1, 12 stampers, fitted with iron lifters, is driven by a 20-horse power engine (portable), with auxiliary boiler. There is also a force pump attached, which supplies the battery with water, also belts to work a lathe in an adjoining apartment, and an amalga mator. There are three main shafts sunk on the Eastern Reef. The workings on this vein are the most im portant, and it has proved the best in the paddock. It averages from 4 to 5 feet thick. There are four levels opened; the lowest one is 198 feet from the surface. The thickness of the vein is here 4 feet, and it is as well defined as in the upper works. There are many breaks, or faults, in this reef; but wherever a break occurs, the quartz has proved very productive. The faults, or breaks, vary in their angle, but the vein always comes back to its original bearings. Its pre sent bearing is going north, 33 degrees west ; but here there is a fault. No. 2 and 3 batteries, of 12 and 8 stamps, and amalgamator, are worked by a 20-horse power engine. The boiler for this engine likewise supplies steam for an eight-horse power pumping engine. No. 4, 12 heads of stamps, a Chilian mill for testing quartz, and a circular saw, employs a 12-horse power engine. The whole of theBe engines are driven by belts. The eight-horse pumping engine, fitted with double action pumping gear, supplies Nns. 2, 3, and 4 bat teries with water. The exhaust steam is condensed between a plate attached to the bottom of an old Chilian mill, supplying the engine working No. 4 battery with hou water (thus economising fuel) and the establishment for necessary cle msing purposes. Quartz is found gold-bearing when the channel or seam runs parallel with the veins. This lode is good for from 30 to 60 feet, but when the channel is found to run across the lode the quartz is barren. The non-auriferous bands extend in width from 10 to 20 feet. This peculiarity is a distinctive feature in this reef, and continues as far as the lode has been pursued in depth. The channels are better defined in this than iu the adjoining reefs. The bands of barren quartz do not always incline in the same course (see section), and are left in as a support, thus saving timber. In one part of this vein it has divided, unit ing\" again after making an elongated ovai, the centre being of slate. It has often attached to itself certain, appaiently, excrescences (carbuncles), but these are of a local character. Tdl lately No. 4 battery has carried the palm for efficiency, crushing over 140 tons of quartz weekly. It has, however, resigned in favour of the No. 1, fitted with iron lifters, which has crushed within a week nearly 180 tons. Besides rsducing more metal, the iron lifters afford other facilities, and the managers intend shortly to adopt this improved appliance in all the batteries. The company is just now trying an ingeniously-con trived ripple-box, to ascertain if the use of blankets is imperative, and they have applied tbe same invention (from which it is almost impossible for mercury to escape) to the bottom of their tables, and thus proved that the blankets ace. very satisfactorily, as, after two weeks' testing, but 8 dwts. ot amalgam (about 2 dwts. of gold) were collected from over 300 tons of tailings. Four large iron tanks, at the back of the extensive machine-house, receive the water pumped for the sup ply of the crushing-works, and they are well contrived to avoid waste. Water is also conducted to them from the mine, and the drainage has been particularly attended to. The colour of the quartz is mostly light grey, with various tints, as red and salmon, and also of a blueish hue with mica. The Old Man's Reef has been partially worked from a tunnel, with indifferent success. The quartz is ex cessively hard and black, cemeuted together like iron- Btone or conglomerate. Robinson's Reef.\u2014 Robinson's Reef has been worked from one main shaft. The lode varies from 4 to 12 feet in thickness, while hut one fault has been met with in 600 feet. It is frequently found mixed with clay, and is very rotten, requiring caution in working. The angles of dip are shown on the drawings. Western Reef.\u2014 This vein has one shaft sunk on it, and is from 3 to 4 feet wide. To the north it has turned out well, but southward it has not been worked. In one place this lode presents the singular appear ance of alternate layeis of solid stone and decomposed quartz (?) like potter's clay, of a foot each, aud thesj are found continuously in the underlay. The yields from these reefs have not been separately tested, but throughout the quartz has proved more payable the further they have gone north. The whole of the lower workings are in most ex cellent order. The company has accepted tenders for a new main shaft, 12 by 15 feet in the clear, to be sunk to the depth of 600 feet in the meantime. It will be fitted with 14-inch pipes, ladder-way, and double winding gear, and is expected to be, when completed, the finest shaft in the colony. A massive engine will be provided for this shaft. At present they have two engines, together 50-horse power, and \u2014 whims. The value of the mining plant, sheds, outhouses, &c., is not less than \u00a310,000. The number of men employed is about 140, inde pendently of wood-carters and men engaged in the bush. B. \u2014 The Port Phillip Company was established at Clunes, and commenced to erect machinery in April, 1857, and started to crush in July, 1857. They obtaii. their principal water supply \u2014 the quan tity wanted being 300 gallons per minute\u2014 from the creek. It is conveyed by a race from the dam, which will be mentioned hereafter. The value of machinery and outhouses is \u00a315,000, at least. There are 70 men employed constantly on the works, either by contract or on wages, whilst fully 40 other men are engaged on works incidental to their operations. It is unneces sary to state that their works are very complete. I should state that the managers are daily expecting the arrival of an engine from England capable of working to 100-horse power. The foundations for fixing the same, which are very massive, are already prepared. C. Criterion Company.\u2014 This company has a claim of 300 feet by 240 feet on the Robinson's and Western Reefs. It adjoins the Clunes United, and is south of the Clunes Co-operative Companies. They have a 12 head battery of stampers, after the plan of the Port Phillip Company. No. 4 battery, with amalgamating apparatus, shaking- table, aud pump complete, is worked by a 20-horse power engine and a whim, to raise the quartz. Their present shaft is 108 feet, from which they have opened five levels on the Robinson s Reef, the longest of which is only 100 feet, as the reef dips, both north and south, about 1 foot in 3. They"], [82, "12 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. and shaking- table, worked by a 16-horse power en gine. The main water supply is from the creek by a tunnel 200 feet, and an open cut 150 feet. The pump is 6\u00a3 inch lift. They have a dam on the hill above the crushing works, in which the water supplied by the drainage of their mine is conserved. The present shaft, sunk through brown slate, is 200 feet deep, from which they have opened two drives to work the Eastern Reef. The level of the present workings is 140 feet from the surface, the lower level not being available, as their lifting power (a whim) is insufficient to keep down the water. In this claim the Eastern Reef is 20 feet in thick ness, towards the cap 23 feet , dipping north 2 feet in 3. The quartz is conveyed by a tramway 650 feet long to the crushing works, but from an insufficient supply of water they h&ve crushed only 60 tons, part of which has yielded 3oz. 17dwt. to the ton. Although the average yield cannot be stated at this spot, it is expected to be over 2.>z. Several hundred tons of stone are raised, and the company will shortly be in full force. have worked the lode out to 60 feet, and the two lower drives are now in 40 and 85 feet respectively. The reef was here within 30 feet of the surface. In thickness it varies from 3 to 18 feet in a distance of 40 feet, and is very irregular in its character. About midway in the claim the reef has broken off at one point, pnd it was found to the eastward in a very scat tered state, b-it soon regained its solid form. In places the reef is very rotten, the quartz being small and mixed with slate, requiring to be well timbered in the working, whilst within a short distance it again proves to be very hard and strong. To the depth of 100 feet this reef underlies to the east, at an angle of 1 in 12 ; but in a shaft the company are now sinking more westerly, to enable them to work both lodes, they have cut the same reef at 116 feet, underlying to the wesr, at an angle of 1 in 3. Their future workings may prove at what depth it may return eastwards. The second shaft will be sunk 140 feet. It is in tended to erect another engine, to pump, and raise the metal. They have been at work since February last, and have crushed 3,000 tons, yielding half an ounce to the ton, which has paid an average dividend of U. 4s. weekly to the working shareholders. For some time they have been testing their tailings as they left the blankets, by bringing them in contact with mercury, but have just discontinued the experi ment, it having proved useless and unprofitable. The water supply is from the Creen, from the trunk race, through a tunnel to a shaft 35 feet deep, from which it is pumped by a 6 inch lift. The water from the mine is also run into this t-haft in case of need. This company have lately introduced the contract system of working, in place of the co-operative, with very sati-factory results. The value of the machinery is 2,500?. D. Clunes United Company.\u2014 This claim adjoins the Clunes Co-operative Company, along the Old Man's and Eastern Reefs to the White Flat Associa tion, 640 feet; and from the Criterion, southward, 300 feet. The machinery is of asuperior character. The value of the work is \u00a33,000. The number of men employed is 30. The company intend to sink another main shaft to the westward, erect a lifting and pumping engine, and put in drives to work all the lodes from one shaft, and enlarge their crushing power. F. Victoria Company. This company is situated between the last named and the North Clunes Mining Company (Esmond's grant). They have a claim of 390 feet along the reefs, aud to the eastward of the Yankee party on the Welcome Reef. They have erected an engine of 30-horse power, with the largest flywheel at dunes \u2014 viz., 14 feet diameter. The shaft is down 200 feet. It is intended to be sunk to 300 feet, as the levels at 150 and 185 feet have not struck the eastern reef. The pumping gear will consist of two 10-inch lifts, one a drawing the other a force lift, and will be very complete. About 150 feet of pipes are at present lowered. The company have hitherto been working with a w.iim, but in a week the engine will enable them further to pursue their mining works. They employ 24 men, but that number will be considerably increased. The engine will be fitted with winding gear, and the batteries, when erected, will be driven by a belt. They propose erecting a 12-stamp battery at first. The value of the presentmachinery is \u00a32,300, independently of the labour at the mine, the claim having been worked under the co-operative system. The Binking here is through 40 feet of rock, and red clay to the brown slate. G. North Clunes Quartz-Mining Company. Be tween this claim and the last -mention ed, a gully about 50 feet deep intervenes. On the rising ground north ward, in the presumed continuations of the reefs, the slate-bottom is found within 18 inches of the surface. A shaft has been sunk to the depth of 200 feet, and levels opened east and west at 156. They have been driven 120 and 138 feet respectively, but have only cut leaders from 8 to 10 inches in width. They have a battery of 12 stamps, erected on tbe CorniBh principle, with pumping gear, shaking tables and amalgamating apparatus, worked by a 25 horse power engine, which is fitted with winding gear. The depth of their engine shaft is 130 feet, in which they have opened two levels to work the Eastern Reef only. The lower level is 1 1 5 feet, which has been extended fur 125 feet. The upper drive is in 250 feet. This lode, going south, bears south by west 1$ point, and under lays at an angle of about 85 degrees. In thickness it averages 3 feet, and is very hard, with sulphurets, the same as the Port Phillip Company At tbe southern end of the claim, next the Com pany's paddock, the Eastern, and Old Man's, and it is believed Robinson's and the Western Reefs, have been hove to the westward by a slide which touches the reefs at an angle of 33 degrees, and there is about 30 feet of slate reef at the breakage. Robinson'a Reef is cast westward 30 feet, and the Eastern Reef 18 feet. In the drive southward about 250 feet there is an indi cation of the Eastern lode regaining its original po sition. On the boundary of the Criterion Company's they are now sinking a shaft through brown slate, to make a cross cut through all the reefs at their lower level. This company commenced to erect machinery in December, 1858, and commenced crushing opera tions in April, 1859. They have only worked the ma chinery three-fifths of the time. I cannot give a regular account of quantities, or the yield, but the claim is payable. The water, obtained from the same source as the other companies, is raised by a force pump, and that which comes from the mine is con served in the same way. The value of the machinery is \u00a32,000, independently of labour performed under the co-operative principle, say other \u00a32,000. The number of men employed is 36. E. Yankee Company adjoins the Clunes Co-ope rative Company on the north, area of claim 100 feet along the reefs by 600 feet. They have the Eastern Reef for a boundary eastward. They have eight stamp heads, pumping gear, amalgamating apparatus, H. Great Western Mining Company. Claim 900 yards by 300 htld by application for a lease, is situ ated to the north of Esmond's. A shanty has been put over the shaft, which is down about 30 feet, but it is not at present at work. They cut some leaders only, in which gold was just detected. The lessees in tend shortly to start in earnest. I. The White Flat Quartz- Mining Association held a leasing claim of 880 yards by 300. They are at pre sent stopped by the want of perfect machinery. The company was established about 12 months since, and they have expended in machinery and works over \u00a39,000. They commenced erecting their machinery in January last, but from want of water it was not fairly tested till June. After various trials and alterations it h?.s been partially condemned, the foundations and bottom timber-work being in secure. The machinery consists of a 25-horse power engine, with 24 stampers, amalgamating apparatus, shaking- table, and pumping gear. The claim has re-"], [83, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 13 cently been put up to auction, and bought in by certain shareholders, who intend to remodel the com pany. As to opening the mine but little has been done. They have sunk two shafts down to the water level, and the northern one, 75 feet, has been worked by a whim. A cross-cut has been made through three of the reefs, eastward of the Western Reef, supposed to be the sane as is worked by the opposite companies, but sufficient work has not been done to prove the fact. Two of the supposed reefs are very faulty in this drive, and the levels have not been extended far enough to test them. The other reef, supposed to be the Eastern, is a well defined and strong lode, being of an average width of six feet, bearing south 12 degrees west, with an under lay of 1 in 15. They have driven out about 800 tons, but the yield has beeu so trifling that I am disposed to think it is the Old Man's Reef, and that, had they put in the cross-cut further eastward, they might have met with better encouragement at starting. In their upper shaft, at a depth of 90 feet, they have likewise made a cross-cut through three of the reefs, all of which are well defined ; but no quartz from this shaft has been tested. This shaft has lately been deepened, in doing which they have struck a vein which has not yet been cut through, evidently gold-bearing, and, so far as gone over. 8 feet wide. The tunnel for their water-supply from the race of the United Companies' dam is 1,898 feet in length. They have erected offices, laid trams, and fur nished every requisite for extensive mining opera tions. The cost of mining plant and labour is \u00a39,145 (value cannot be stated), and it will cost nearly \u00a32,000 tor alterations. This hill was considerably worked in 1856-7, at which time the parties got 17 and 18 dwts. per ton, and another 2\u00a3oz. per ton ; but from want of perfect crushing power at that time it was abandoned. There is every expectation that, with good machinery and management, this hill may yet rival its opposite neighbour : as it is, it has yet to be proved. J. The South Clunes Quartz-Mining Company have just taken up a lease of 900 yards by 300 yards, along the reefs south of the White Flat Company. The les- sees, Messrs. P. Mark and F. P. Hickox, on behalf of the company (20 shareholders at present), have promptly called for tenders to sink a new shaft, to prove the ground, pending this it is not contemplated to increase the number of shareholders. of auriferous ground to the west, now been tested by the Lady Barkly party (elsewhere noted). The bottom, starting from the apex of the Eastern Reef, is in the form of a distinct gutter of the average width of 100 feet, running through Messrs. M'Donalds and Com pany's private property, which had been leased to the Port Phillip Company, sub-let to this company, and is being worked by the Tributers, each of whom has an interest in the proceeds. The royalty (? rent) has recently been reduced from 32 \u00a3 per cent, to 12J per cent. The auriferous nature of this ground was dis covered by the Yankee party \u2014 outsiders. The Tributers took possession and commenced to work in July, 1858. They have on the ground (which extends for 1,728 feet by an average width of 400 feet,) three separate shifts and engines, consisting in the aggregate of 30-horse power. The depth of sinking varies going east. No. 1 shaft is 113 feet, through 80 feet of basaltic rock, requiring to be blasted. Forty feet from the Burface consists of large hard boulders, the lower is m\u00abre rotten. No. 2 shaft is 120 feet deep, 85 feet of rock. No. 3 shaft is 131 feet deep, 90 feet of rock. From the surface to the rock (about 5 feet) is black clay, and below the rock there is a like depth of strata of red clay. There is brown gravel to the wash-dirt which varies in depth. The washdirt is from 4 to 7 feet in depth, and consists of decomposed slate reef, mixed with quartz boulders, and is of a stiff clayey nature. The bottom is of pipeclay. The general yield has been about half an ounce to the load, producing from September 13, 1858 to the present time, 6,936oz. of gold, of a fine description. The workings have been very extensive, being driven out to a width of 100 feet, by a length of 400 feet, with branch drives in all directions. At one part of tho ground thus wrought out, the superincumbent mass has settled down bodily from the surface about 5 feet, although supported (?) by a stratum of about 90 feet of rock. Throughout the underground workings tram ways have been laid down, and the wash -dirt removed to the shafts in woodden and iron trucks, which are raised to the surface, where they are deposited on a double tramway of a like gauge, for speedy transit and return to and from the steam puddling-machine. The puddling-machines are attached to the engine working \" Vo. 3\" shaft, and are three in number. Here the wash-dirt, after undergoing the usual process, is sub mitted to the action of a free current of water, which carries it off through a bottom trap, aud it is sluiced without the labour of lifting. The plan adopted, which is as economical as it is ingenious, is the invention of Mr. John Boag, the Tributers' enginesr and manager. The quantity of dirt capable of being thus disposed of is about 150 loads per day. They have about two years more work before them. The number of men employed is 70. The value of machinery and mining plant on the surface is not less than \u00a34,000. In the workings of this company, besides discovering the Welcome Reef, they have frequently struck veinB of from 1 to 2 feet thick, which have not been proved. The Welcome was cut 12 feet from No. 1 shaft. Ten tons of the stone produced over 30oz. Their capital is \u00a36,000, with power to increase to \u00a324,000. K. The Haphazard Company commenced to sink a shaft to work the reefs discovered in the alluvial workings of No. 17. They are down about 80 feet, and intend to sink 200 feet. The Brunswick Company have amalgamated with the above company, the same reefs passing through both claims. They will be worked from this shaft. I could gather no information regarding the prospect of these reefs, simply that they were well satisfied to sink another shaft and test the same. There are 10 men employed. L. is a shaft being put down by the Port Phillip Company for the Haphazard Reefs. They opened out at 38 feet, and drove east and west 135 feet without cutting them. They are sinking to a depth of 100 feet, intending to open levels and drive the same. The sinking is 4 feet of soft and decomposed volcanic rock, and below that is slaty sandstone reef. M. Perseverance Company. This company is situated to the east of the Clunes United Company. They commenced to sink, and drove for the Welcome Reef. More than one contract has been issued for the work, and carried out without present success. Alluvial mining here is very limited in its character as far as the extent of the present workings have gone. North Clunes again commands the first notice. No.l. Clunes Co-operative Company (Tributers). \u2014The celebrated alluvial deposits worked by this company start from the corner of the Eastern Reef, crossing the Welcome Reef, about midway in the company's pad dock, going eastward. There is also a supposed run 2. Lady Barkly Company. \u2014 This claim is situated at the west of the reefs and above Messrs. Nicholls and party's 7 acres leasing claim. They commenced six weeks since to prospect for a supposed run of aurifer ous ground, extending westward from the point of the Eastern Lead. They have put in a tunnel nearly 5 feet high, and over 600 feet in length, and struck: wash-dirt, but have not tested it yet. The drive is through hard slate, and tke wash -dirt is brown clay and gravel mixed. The bottom is mixed slate and pipe clay. This work has been performed under some disadvantages, as they had to return some 200 feet, and raise the level of the tunnel. It is an instance of perseverance. There are eight men employed. The claims further to be enumerated are to the north, and run parallel with the Clunes Company's paddock, gome of the holders of which volunteered the"], [84, "MINING SURVEYORS* REPORTS. 14 information that they were obtaining their wash-dirt from the private property. 3 North Clunes Alluvial Mining Company.\u2014 A leasehold claim of seven acres, held by Nicholls and party, situated to the west of the No. 2 Lady Barkly The Haphazard Reef is supposed to run through the grant, and an application has been made to work the same, but nothing has been done in earnest as yet, though it is understood a commencement will be made at an early date. 4. Friends of Justice Company.\u2014 The shaft is 94 feet deep, through 14 feet of black clay, 60 feet of rock, re quiring blasting, and about 40 feet of surface rock, corresponding with that in the paddock. The bottom ia of pipe clay mixed with slate. The wash-dirt is red clay mixed with gravel, yielding from 3 to 12 ozs. to the machine. They have a tramway to their machine in the gully, to the north, which is 540 feet long, where they have budt a dam. The cost of the works, whim, two horses, cradle, &c, 485?.

The bottom dips towards the company's paddock. The gold is very fine. The claim is worked by a whim, puddling-machine, and three horses. Eight men are employed. There are two other shafts here with whims. One is used to bale water, which is conveyed in boxes, and used for washing requirements by the Homeward Bound Company, aud the other shaft be longed to a company on the Welcome Reef, which has amalgamated with the Victoria Quartz Company. 8. All Nations Company. \u2014 Depth of shaft, 125 feet, through 75 feet of Lard rock. The wash-dirt yields 5oz. to the machine. They have a whim, puddling machine, and long-torn. The claim pays wages to eight men employed. The value of plant is \u00a3160. being struck in this locality, and it remains to be proved if the wash-dirt from the reefs is only payable to any extent within the company's private property. eight holes have been sunk, near this shaft, varying in depths from 140 to 150 feet. The rock averages 120 feet, and requires to be all blasted. Gold naa been got in each claim, but not in payable quantities. The surface is of a sandy nature, about three feet over the rock. To the north-east of this spot there are indications of deep grouud. I take my data from the depth and dip of holes |sunk last summer, and aban doned for the Back Creek rush. On the southern hill, west of the road to Back Creek, there are aeven alluvial companies in full work, two shafts at present abandoned, and two shafts being sunk for quartz. On the rise of the hill, the depths of the shafts vary proportionately with the incline, and the thickness of the trap-rock is in about the same ratio. The bottom throughout is pipeclay, almost flat, with only a very slight dip to the we-t. The wash-dirt is conveyed to the creek, where there are seven puddling-machines and the usual washing- apparatus. In all the shafts sunk the trap-rock is of a soft honey comb character, requiring no blasting. On the lower portions of the workings the surface has settled down bodily several feet. There is but little water below \u2014 none to incommode the miner. 13. John Bull Company. \u2014 Their shaft is 80 feet deep. The strata met with in sinking are black clay mixed with large honeycomb boulders down to the wash-dirt, which consists of decomposed slate reef, quartz boulders, and a reddish clay. It is of a stiffish nature. The gold is very fine, yielding to 15 men about \u00a33 each per week. The claim is worked with a whim and two horses. The wash-dirt is conveyed to the machine by a tramway about 250 feet long. They have a double line, the loadei waggon taking up the empty one. 14. The Rainbow Company.\u2014 Depth of shaft 70 feet, sinking the same as in No. 13. The party state that between them and the claims above them there is a ridge of extra poor ground, which will not p-yfor working, running parallel with ihe present Creek. This claim is worked by a windlass and 10 men. The wash-dirt is carted to the Creek. The gold is very fine, and the average yield is U. per week per man. 15. The Prospecting l'arty\u2014 Southern Light Com pamy.\u2014Depth of the shaft is 45 feet. The sinking was through 12 feet of trap-rock, the remainder clay and boulders. They take tbe wash-dirt the height of their drives. It consists of little or no gravel, being decomposed slate and large boulders of quartz, and is transmitted to their machine by a tramway 250 feet long. The gold is fine, yielding to eight men em ployed about \"Si. each per week. This ejaim is worked by a windlass. 16. Li ve-and -Let-Live Company. \u2014 The shaft is now being sunk, aud is down 50 feet through soft trap-rock. Eight men are employed. 17. Haphazard Company.\u2014 The depth of the shaft to the bottom is 80 feet. This shaft has been worked for 10 months, and aided by superior appliances, as whim, shoots, tramway 400 feei long, machine for \u00bb puddling, large cradle, &c, but without payable results. It is now abandoned. Before giving up this shaft, the party (10 men) discovered two separate quartz veins, and are now sinking a fresh shaft to prove the same. The plant I believe is for sale. 18. Bruncwick Company.\u2014 The shaft is 110 feet deep. Rock was met in sinking 60 feet. The gold ob tained is heavy, but scarce. Tne claim is worked by a whim, two horses, and 10 men. The wash-dirt is con veyed to the puddling-machine by a tramway 600 feet in length. This company also discovered the quartz reefs running through the Haphazard claim. I am informed that both companies saw gold in the stone, but the veins have not been tested. 19. Young Sons of Freedom Company \u2014The shaft is 123 feet deep. This claim is now being worked by the third party. The first party did not bottom. The present party took up the claim about three months since, after much labour they secured the shaft and 9. Golden Horn Company. \u2014 Depth of shaft, 150 feet ;i *irface clay, 20 feet ; rock, 80 feet. Flat slaty bottom. The yield per machine is from 4 to 6 ounces. In the workings, they have met with quartz leaders about a foot thick, aud gidd-bearing. The heaviest gold from the hill is taken from this claim. The claim is wrought by a whim, two horses, puddling- machine, &c, which, with working expenses, have cust \u00a3500. Eight men are employed. 10. Cornish Party of 14 Men. \u2014 Depth of shaft 155 feet ; similar sinking to No. '* 9,\" but only one foot of wash-dirt, and very pour. They are earning but 20s. to 30s. per week.

New Constitution Company.\u2014 Tbe shaft is sunk on the table-land 163 feet deep, through 125 feet of trap-rock\u2014 viz., 55 feet soft honeycomb, and 70 feet more solid ; the remainder is clay and boulders. It has hitherto been worked by the windlass, which is at present abandoned. It is stated they intend to e-'ect a whim to work the claim to more advantage. The bottom has still a slight dip towards the west, but the ground is all alike poor. 21. Homeward- Bound Company. \u2014 This shaft is at present abandoned ; but the company have discovered a quartz-vein in their claim, which they intend to work. The vein has been proved to be gold-beariug, but has not been tested in any quantities. [Mr. Cusack forwards longitudinal and transverse sections of Kangaroo Reef, with a plan of Fisher's and Kangaroo reefs, and a plan of the principal mining township on this gold-field. Appended to the plan is a tracing from the half-inch map of the district, show ing the locality, distances, &c, Jl to scale, according to the \" Instructions.\"] From the foregoing it will be observed that deeper and perhaps more payable ground has yet to be opened. Nos. 20 and 21 have sunk in the deepest ground, still the bottom has a tendency to dip ; but the ground is very poor as far as proved. Fisher's Reef. \u2014 The prospect claim is the only one at work at present, and, with -ne exception of No. 1 north, and Nos. 1 and 2 south, no other claims found this reef. The last crushin from the prospect claim averaged only 19dwt. per to i, but this low yield is attributed to the circumstance of a quantity of non auriferous quartz (casing) r eing mixed. All the other claims were sunk to the epths shown on plan, and abandoned. Dam. \u2014 A large dam was constructed during last summer, about a mile up tite Creek, for the supply of water during the dry season, to the quartz companies who united to build the same, viz. \u2014 the Port Phillip Company, White Flat Association, the Criterion, and Clunes United Companies. It was an expensive work. An escape- channel had been cut of the width of 66 feet, to let off the storm- water, and pipes fixed to feed a lower dam, and the embankment was nearly com pleted, when, owing to a violent fall of rain, and the breakage of some dams at Creswick, the embankment was overflowed and damaged to a great extent. The completion of the work was suspended, but will be resumed during the next season, and it is hoped under more favourable auspices, as it will benefit the whole district. From the lower dam is constructed a sluice and trunk-race, to communicate with the various crushing works, by branches from the same, whilst the storm and tail water is allowed to take its usual course down the Creek. Kangaroo Reef. \u2014 For yields of this reef see accom panying table with alphabetical references. The sec tions are taken from tw 3 shafts of the prospect claim, the only important g:oup on this reef. The trans verse is indicated by a line on plan. The longitudinal section shows the sh*Ks and the manner of timbering and working, also the portions of galleries filled by the refuse quartz aod rick. In No. 1 north the por tion of the reef referred to as taken out (marked K) has averaged 9oz. per ton. It was abandoned, and is now taken up ruder lease by Messrs. Belt and Co. On the north ena of this claim the reef breaks off, and has not been found further north. In No. 1 south the reef was found but abandoned, without any quartz being crushed, so that this portion of the reef is still undeveloped. Parker's Reef.\u2014 From No. 9 north to No. 6 south, a distance ot 450 yards, this reef is being actively worked. For depths and yields see table. Messrs. Blake and Parker have applied for a lease of the sou thern end Jrom No. 6.) Opossum Reef.\u2014 Nos. 1 to 4 south are being worked. For yields see table. There are now sou\u2122 leasing companies being formed for portions of the following reefs: \u2014 Potts and Co.'s, Moore's, Morgan's and Levia than Reefs, Kemp and < o.'s, Opossum, Blake and Parker's, Parker's, and Belt and Co.'s Kangaroo Reef. I believe under good management all these reefs wiuld yield remuneratively, aud be the means of developing others. Mount Egerton \u2014On the Large Hill Claims Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 are being worked. On this hill thers is one main reef from 30 to 50 feet wide, and several (five) small ones or leaders varying from 2 feet 6 inches to 4 inches wide, all containing gold. On the Little Hill Scott and party have some quartz raised but not crushed yet. On All Nations Gully (alluvial) there are six claims at work and aboat 30 miners. The depth being worked is from 46 feet to 80 feet. It is necessary to observe that in a few cases I have received incorrect information at the claims when in quiring ' the average yields, but in future, as in the present table, I will refer to the crushers' books, which are invariably correct. I am progressing with the plans and sections of the other reefs, which I will forward when completed. Clunes Water Supply Company. \u2014 A company has just been formed to convey water from the Bullarook Creek. The race will be nine miles in length, with a fall of \u2014 feet to the mile. The first mile passes through stony land, and will have to be close boxed, and after that no difficulties will be met, until ic enters North Clunes, where a fluming about 100 feet high will have to be erected. A constant supply will thus be secured to North Clunes, and as it will benefit the miner and merchant, I have no doubt it will prove successful, and stimulate mining enterprise, as the want of water has hitherto proved a great drawback. In the dry season wash-dirt from the Northern Hill , has been carted a considerable distance to be puddled. Prospecting.\u2014 There has been a certain amount of prospecting around the district, principally upon quartz-reefs abutting on the surface, north and south from here ; but the resul's have not proved satis- factory, whether* from want of energy or capital I cannot say. In my opinion, there is a fair field open in the immediate district, for a well-organised and judicious system of assisted prospecting, in which the miners would heartily co-operate. That capital and labour could be beneficially united in this district I cannot doubt. The fact of several gold-bearing quartz-reefs having been recently struck, by accident as it were, warrants the presumption that bands of unknown quartz-lodes traverse the substrata, and that therefore, in mining for the continuations of known reefs, the chance of striking others of equal or greater value renders pro specting universally encouraging."], [86, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 16 Table showing the Reefs, Depth of Shafts, Width of Reefs, and Yield per Ton, at Gordon. Stieglitz Quartz-mining Company. \u2014 This company has been formed, and the works are already proceed ing rapidly. The small engine in the northern por tion of the ground is at work crushing the quartz raised, and tenders aro called for the sinking of the shaft known as Davis's, on which the ensrine is now situated. From the deep levels of the neighbouring claim (the Malakoff) 200 feet below the worked-out levels in the company's ground, rich quartz is now being obtained. Tenders have been called for the sinking of a new engine shaft, and the new engine, 35 horse power, is now on the road. Gibraltar.\u2014 This company has never stayed its opera tions, and, pending- the formation of the company, is proceeding as usual. The lode looks as good as ever, and is increasing in width as it descends. Italian Reef .\u2014This company is in the course of form ation. The vein is wide, and the gold is visible in the quartz, and with proper machinery' would show first rate prospects. Wellington Reef Company (late the Old German Reef), \u2014 This company has never suspended opera tions.' They have a quantity of quartz raised, tbe property of the former proprietors. The same men are employed by the new company. The vein is 2 feet wide, and looks well both at and above the water level. It has always been a payable reef, even under the worst management, and cannot fail to pay the new proprietors handsomely. Yankee Reel Company.\u2014 This company is in the course of formation. The reef has been one of the richest at Stieglitz. It has been worked down to the water level, and has commonly yielded from 20oz. to 34oz. per ton. The lease comprises eight other known reefs, all auriferous\u2014 in one or two cases yielding as much as 18oz. per ton. The whole of the veins are wide\u2014 from 10 in. to 18 in. This is a very valuable piece of ground. Albion Reef Company. \u2014 This company has stayed its operations in order to erect heavier machinery. This has been a very rich reef. It. has yielded over 40oz. per ton. It has been worked to tho water-level, with the yield still in the vein. The vein averages 18 inches in thickness, and has^yielded a very large quan tity of gold already. The shareholders in tbe Invincibles, Victoria Reef, have applied for a lease of their ground, including claims further to the north, to the extent of 600 yards by 200 yards. The prospectors of this ground are sanguine of good results from the deep ground in their claim, but up to the present time have been unable to master the difficulties before them in the shape of water, with tr-eir small resources. The dip of the reef from the Allies' Claim, known as the richest in Stieglitz, inclines north into their ground at an angle of 60 degrees, and from the cause above referred to has not been struck in the Invincibles' claim. Several smaller leaders have been worked in this ground and have proved payable. (a) Driving for tbe reef. (ft) None ciushed lately. (c) Under the average.

Since my las', report this too-long-neglected field has attracted considerable attention, and many com panies are now in the course of formation to work the different reefs. This has given hope to the miners, and although the town has a deserted appearance at present, there are evident signs of a cheerful future. There is no doubt that the companies, under proper management, will pay handsomely ; and I may ven ture to say that in several cases there is no specula tion at all in the matter ; success is as certain as any miniBg enterprise can possibly be. Of course there must be an outlay of capital, more or less, before any results can be arrived at. The miner has exhausted his limited means \u2014 he has in most cases followed the gold down to the water-level, and in many instances far below it ; and it is here that the capitalist must take his place, and by pur chase or other arrangements unite many claims together, sufficient to constitute a mine. Strictly speaking, it is at this point that mining actually com mences. The windlass and bucket must give place to the steam-engine, the bullock hide to the pump, the barrow to the truck and tramway. The miner, too, must here look to his weekly wages, instead of, as heretofore, to uncertain c rustlings, the produce of his too often ill-diiected labour, and 1 am certain the change will be for the better. T.ie wealth of the colony will rapidly increase, and the miners' homes will wear an air of comfort which they have not as yet exhibited. The following is a list of the companies formed, aud in course of formation, for working this field, and some account of their progress. Sailor's Reef. \u2014 The vein in this reef is from 1 foot to 2 feet wide, and its appearance is very favourable at present. The machinery is almost completed and will be at work in a few days. Perseverance Company.\u2014 This company is progress ing steadily and expects to commence operations shortly. A lease has been applied for on Iron Bark Reef, by a company to b$ named Copenhagen Mining Com pany. It is proposed to erect a 20-horse power en gine with crushing machinery, &c, and I have no^ doubt the projectors will be well paid, as it is a very strong steady vem and will average at least 2oz. per ton. Individual Miners and Small Claims. \u2014 In reference to these, I beg to state that New Year's Reef is yield ing very rich quartz. They expect, at least, 20oz per ton. The previous quartz has averaged 7oz. per ton. The Redan Company, New Chum Reef south, is obtaining very rich quartz, as usual. The previous averages have been 16oz. per ton. There are many auriferous veins in it, a diagram of which I propose sending next month. There are many other smaller parties working on this reef, and obtaining exceedingly rich quartz. The Birmingham Reef Prospect Claim, south end of Boxing Reef. \u2014 After working a long time, a rich vein has been struck. They expect at least 7oz. to the ton.

Scotchman's Reef. \u2014 This reef, abandoned for a period of three years, has als > been taken up, and at the last crushing the quartz averaged 3Joz. per ton. These facts in reference to our abandoned reefs need no comment. in all to 2,261 lineal yards \u2014 have been registered, all under Bye-law 94, which allows a delay of two months after the registration for the purpose of obtaining machinery. Machinery is necessary from the great depth of sinking (230 teet), and the quantity of water met with. On German Reef, the last crushing (a week or two since) produced 2oz. per ton. Moorabool Diggings. \u2014 A lease of land, containing 60 acres, has been applied for, on the banks of the Moora bool, near Morrison's Station, and the projectors of the company have chosen an excellent site. There ap pears to he every facility for obtaining abundance of water, washing stuff, and everything required to carry on large operations. The whole of the present field presents, to my mind, a fine opportunity for the es tablishing of many large slucing companies. Dolly's Creek Diggings. \u2014 The miners here are still steadily progressing. The diggings are chiefly con fined to individual miners. There is one machine erected to puddle the washing-stuff for the miners, with satisfactory results to both parties. I beg to enclose sections of the Malakoff and Gib raltar claims, showing the present state of the work ings, with the dips of the vein. I have selected these shafts for the reasons that they are working the deepest ground which has yet been opened on this field, and there is a great interest attached tothedeep ground workings at present. [Mr. Woolgrove has not furnished tables relating to machinery, population, &c, as required by the \"In structions.\"] The accompanying plan is of a survey of what is called abandoned ground (with a few exceptions of two or three men working). Anyone who has a water right which can be brought on the ground can obtain 100 yards square of the same ; and if an extensive tail race is dug to facilitate the sluicing of tbe ground, four extra claims of a similar size to the first are given. On the plan is shown one of these tail races, which is between 30 and 40 feet deep at the upper end, and 400 yards long. It has cost between \u00a3300 and \u00a3400. The party hive a plentiful supply of water, and they are thus enabled to wash a large quantity of earth at a small cost. Where the nature of the soil will allow of this mode being adopted, I believe it is the most economical way of extracting gold yet discovered. Sxakb Valley Division.

Mining operations in this district during the month have progressed favourably. The greater number 0 the sluices have been kept running steadily. A few raceowners find their supply diminished owing to the dry season, and are obliged to work short hours, but on the whole work has been steadily carried on. The season has been a remarkably dry one, and unless we get two or three weeks steady rain before the sum- mer sets in, I am afraid but a very small amount of gold will be procured during the ensuing summer and autumn. As I stated before, mining in this district depends altogether on the supply us water. Box- sluicing is fast giving way to ground sluicing, and in that respect a greatly improved method is coming into use, \u2014 for example, the claim of Messrs. Thom- son and party on Hurdle Flat. The ground now worked by that party has all of it been partially worked in former times, and the present party have gone to a great expense in cutting a deep tail-race or sluice from Europa Gully up to their claim, nearly the whole way through a reef which crops out between the claim and the gully, parts of the tail-race being sunk 12 feet deep on the rock. The result is, that although their ground is 16 feet 6 inches deep, the sluice is in the rock, and through such being the case the facility they have of washing the dirt is so great that I am informed by themselves that the incredibly small quantity of 4 grains ot gold, or 6d., to the load, will remunerate them well. There are four partners, and on an average they get down and wash a ton of dirt every five minutes. They receive their supply of water fro.n springs on Hurdle Flat. I annex a vertical section of a portion of the ground in this claim, Position No. 2, on plan of Europa Gully. Another party, Messrs. Dillon and Co., have nearly completed what I may call a stupendous undertaking for a party of four miners. They have cut a tail-race (see plan annexed), which, when completed, will be 900 yards long\u2014 the greater portion of it through rock \u2014 to work the ground included in their claim (tinted red on the plan) at the upper part of Europa Gully. This ground has all been partially worked and fossicked\u2014 that is, holes and paddocks put down pretty well all over it, but the gully, owing to the The population in July was 9.924. This similarity In the two months shows that the population here is settled, as comparedhvith mostly other districts. This is accounted for chiefly by the nature of the diggings. These are composed mostly of ground which has been worked rapidly, and the richest parts only taken, the rest being lest until wages should become lower, or neater facilities be found for extracting the gold. These facilities have been obtained by the increased supply of water, which increase has been obtained mainly by the openirg-up of springs, and the under mining of the hills adjoining the creeks and gullies, in the search for gold. T. e latter has been the means of increasing the supply ot water by much larger quan- tities than is generally supposed. Some dams have also been formed to collect the rains from adjoining water sheds, bit these are few in number in this dis trict as compared with others. The labour in creating these facilities has been in some instances very great, and tbe interests thus formed have become in the aggregate of considerable value. There are eight puddling-machines, and seven steam-engines from six to 12 horse power. The latter are employed in raising the wash-dirt and water from the drives. As sluicing is the rule in this district, there is necessarily a great sameness in digging opera tions. That they are prosperous is evidenced by the large quantity of gold sent down by escort. The Bowman's Forest Lead is looking up. Up to the end of August six claims, of nearly 60 yards each, were taken up ; and since then 30 more\u2014 amounting C"], [88, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 18 the same time. In fact a party are now using the water derived from the north end, and have cut a race for its transmission from the tunnel to Back Creek, where they use it. Note. \u2014 The number of machines is from personal observation, and the population is taken from the police reports. I estimate 300 Europeans as being other than miners, and 100 Chinese as not being actually engaged in mining. There are no quartz claims in operation in this district. slight natural fall, is at present completely smothered, as it is technically termed, with tailings. To enable Messrs. Dillon and party to work this ground they have been obliged to cut this expensive tail-race, giving it an average fall of 4$ inches to 12 feet, the least fall which a ground sluice ought to have. The expense of cutting this has been very heavy\u2014 about \u00a31,000 I believe\u2014 but in my opinion they will be well remunerated for all when they once get to work. The ground where the claim is marked out has been highly auriferous, and by the former method of working but a very small per-centage of the precious metal was extracted. The extent of ground they hold by authority of one of the by-laws of the Mining Board is a little over 10 acres, so that they have work before them for some years, and therefore some induce ment to incur such an expense. These are tbe me thods of sluicing which will pay in this district, and to which eventually all other methods at present in use must succumb. At the lower portion of Europa Gully, adjoining the Messrs. Adams' claim, Messrs. Chappell and Son are working. They use two hydraulic hoses (oandy on plan), but they have neither head nor tail fall enough for this method of working. The principle is good, but it requires a good pres sure, and a great fall for the tail-race to work it with advantage. The upper portion of this claim, as far as the tail-race (marked red on the plan) extends, was worked by this party in a rather unique style, viz., with bullocks. The dirt being composed of stiff blue clay was very difficult to wash, they there fore threw it in the tail-race, which was wide enough for two bullocks to walk in, and draw up and down first a plough to loosen the Huff, and then a harrow to puddle it. Such machinery, however, must give way to more modern inventions. With reference to the annexed plan, letters\u2014 Indigo Division. (Thomas E. Thornely, Mining Surveyor.)

There are 25 puddling-machines not at work. The middle part of the Old Main Lead, Indigo, is now extensively worked by Chinese. Nothing fur ther has been proved of the lead beyond the plan furnished, as the flat is very wide and difficult to prove. The New Ballaarat Lead is nearly worked out from below section 1, plan No. 5, to section 2, and has throughout averaged good wages. To the west of No. 2 section to the Nil Desperandum (or the original prospecting claim), plan 4, is now being worked, but the lead is not yet defined. The original prospecting party have bottomed their second shaft. I hear it reported that the wash -dirt, which is 4J feet in thick ness, will yield an average of l^oz. to the cart-load. Westward of the Nil Desperandum claim (now called the Chiltern Lead) is taken up for some distance. There are two engines at work on the lead, and two others will be finished this month. Stockyard Lead, so called on plan No. 5, though properly a continuation of New Ballaarat Lead, is all but worked out, and has averaged good wages. The upper part of the Suffolk Lead, from No. 1, section 3, plan 5, is worked out, and can scarcely be said to have yielded average wages. The lower part of the lead, which is being steadily worked, will pay well, from prospects obtained. The Caledonian, mentioned in my July report as having struck payable gold in the prospecting claim, have proved the width of the lead to be only 20 feet, with 12 inches of washdirt ; and the average is ljoz. to the cart-load. Two other shafts to tbe west have bottomed on the lead, which give better prospects. The ground is very wide, and causes a difficulty in proving the lead. Many shafts have been sunk on the reef. Several gullies are now being prospected in the neighbourhood, with every appearance of success. All the leads in this district are very patchy as to the gold, and vary considerably in thickness of wash- dirt.

Vertical section No. 2 is taken in Messrs. Foster and party's claim, situated on the right-hand bank of the Nine-mile Creek, a little above the township of Staney. The pipeclay reef shown thereon was formerly considered the bottom, until this party went through and came on gravel which is highly auriferous. They w\u00bbsh it in a puddling-mill, and put everything through, with the exception of 2 or 3 feet of the surface. This claim is paying remarkably well. In my next report I will endeavour to send a sec tion of a belt across the whole district, so as to show the different kinds and depths of the auriferous drifts.

Some few parties are still engaged, and are, I believe, making wages, but no- thing new in these branches has transpired. Several claims on the old line of quartz-workings have changed hands, and at figures remunerative to the original discoverers. At the Strath, King Parrot, and Muddy Creeks, new veins have been opened, in seme cases with tolerable success. The quartz crushed here since my last report has, I believe, averaged the usual re- turns. The population is unsettled. Many are leaving this place for the localities above mentioned, and there are numerous parties scattered over the district for the purpose of prospecting the various reefs, which with- out doubt exist, although not yet opened up. There is every prospect of this locality being amply supplied with crushing machinery in the course of a few months. Two machines are already in course of erection at Reedy Creek, namely,Perkin8 and Co.'s and Nickinson and Co.'s. and another is expected to arrive shortly for Mr. Johnson, who has one already actively engaged here. On the Strath Creek, distant about six miles from this, and in the vicinity of several important reefs, Mr, Sloane is busily engaged in erecting crushing machi- nery. On the King Parrot Mr. C. Johnson has already a portable six-horse power engine on the ground, and proposes to erect powerful machinery to be worked by water power. Messrs. Williamson and Co. are also 8,864 There are 7 steam pumping- engines in this division, of the aggregate of 108-horse power, of which 6 are at work, and 1 idle. There are now 13 quartz-crushing machines, of the aggregate of 203-horse power, aud of these 3 are in course of erection ; and there are 445 puddling-machines, each of one-horse power, and of these there are 85 idle. Back Creek. \u2014 On this gold-field during the present month there have been some further proofs of its claim to be considered a first-class gold-field, and now no doubt can be entertained of its permanency. Lately, gold has been discovered at three distinct points adjoining the recent workings, the result of which is the opening from those points of three sepa- rate leads under the frontage system. The first two proclaimed, viz., the Black Lead and Union Lead, are situated in a beautiful valley, extending along the Back Creek in a westerly direction, pne end of which is a likely basin, immediately on the west side of Scandinavian Lead. On the north side of this basin is the rich claim called Prince of Wales, in which a valu- able gutter had been discovered, and traced in the di- rection of the basin ; this, as well as other favourable indications, have induced the miners to have the Union Lead proclaimed under the frontage system. With regard to the gutter in the Prince of Wales, the shareholders are not yet prepared to publish de- tails. The Black Lead commences in the Flat, 20 chains south-west from Sault's Hotel. Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 6, and 7, marked on the tracing, have already struck gold. The claims, as bonded, are amalgamated. The wash dirt in those claims varied from 5 to G feet in height, and in Nos. 2 and 3 it pays at the rate of 4oz. to *he load. Nos. 8, 9, and 10, reach the Government Re serve, which encloses three claims, or 360 feet, along the supposed course of this promising lead.

The depth of sinking is shown on the section of the shaft 6, 6, and 7. There are no holes yet bottomed in the -Jnion ; and as the starting-points of both leads are diametri cally opposite, it is very probable that when both leads are fully defined they will be found to be one continuous lead. The third lead, called the Rocky Flat, is not at present so great a favourite. The prospectors are as yet the only party who have bottomed, and the yield of their wash-dirt in the shaft was a little over 1 dwt. to the tub. CHINESE. On the three leads 64 claims have been already taken up, and each claim must, by our by-law, have six working men. It follows that3S4 bonafde miners are now employed at Back Creek under the frontage system. Tota1 Europeans and Chinese, 6,575. Note. \u2014 This table comprises only those actually en gaged in mining. I estimate the total population at 8,500. The whole is the result of my own observa tion. Mount Greenock. \u2014 At the base of this hill, on the north side, there are about 100 miners busily employed mining in a paddock, the property of a Mr. Ambrose, who it appears has arranged with the miners to receive from each 3s. per week for surface damages. In the paddock, on tiie sloping side of the hill, there are several holes bottomed within a few feet of, and on a line with, the fence. Outside the fence there is a surveyed road, underwhich a gutter has been traced from the inside. This discovery created, as usual, a little rush outside of the fence. In the meantime the Warden insisted that the road, though notyetopen, should nut be undermined ; however, after some time, that gentleman allowed parties to sink on it, on the payment of \u00a38 from the holders of each claim, as a secirity for repairs. During this process the \" in siders\" lost no time in gutting the road, leaving the \" outsiders\" nothing to sink for. As soon as they dis covered that their wash-dirt had been converted into headings, they immediately lodged their complaints with the Warden. The case is still pending. I am unable to ascertain the quantity of wash-dirt, having no other source for intormation than tbe \" in siders\" from whom I could derive information, and they have an object, of course, in concealing its rich ness. On the Avoca Main Lead, which is principally oc cupied by puddlers, I cannot note any material change. Those employed, I am credibly informed, are all doing remaikably well. They are carting away the alluvium from the surface to the bedrock, a depth of from 7 to 15 feet, and washing the whole by the slow and inefficient process of the horse-puddling machine. An excellent opportunity here presents itself to a company for bonaflde investment, a certain per centage on which might safely be calculated upon, by washing the whole of this lead (which is from five to eight chains wide, and proverbial for its rich de posits), with the improved process by steam. An abundant supply of water is available within a short distance, at the lower portion of this lead, where alao a good lead of gold is known, still unworked. Indi vidual enterprise has relinquished the working, in consequence of the superabundance of water. At the Amphitheatre, mining is in rather a retro gressive state, and the population is slightly on the decrease, partly in consequence of a rush having taken place to Fiery Creek. The rush on the Amphitheatre flat, caused by the finding of a 28oz. nugget, does not appear to have been attended with favourable results, as none of the adjacent claims have been able to find any payable ground. At the Mountain Hut mining is in the same state u detailed in my last report. At Petre's diggings the population is slightly on tbe increase, the whole being able to earn a good liveli hood. The sinking is easy and shallow, aDd the yield of gold from \u00a3oz. to 2oz. per load. At St. Arnaud mining is more of a settled nature than at any other plact, in the district, in consequence of the workings being principally in quartz. Al the old alluvial workings, which are distant two miles and a half from the principal quartz mines, near the town ship, there is a number of Chinese employed, mostly in working horse puddling machines. They are taking the whole depth of tbe lead (alluvium 16 feet) down to the bed rock, and from what I could ascertain, the whole would pay ldwt. per lnad. There are two quartz reels nearly at the head of the alluvial work ings, one of which has been worked some time since to a depth of 160 feet, at which level water was struck, and the workings, in consequence, abandoned. Here, also, is an opportunity (second to none, not excluding the famed Poverty Reef, at Sandy Creek) for the capitalist safely to invest, for the water, which retards the working, might bo profitably employed in washing the alluvium immediately upon the surface upon the same ground. The old alluvial workings cross the lode, and the width of these is about six chains, tbe depth from two to 10 feet, and the yield, on the average, ldwt. per ton per lode. I was informed by the person who had worked this now abandoned lode to the water level, that the stone would not give more than an ounce to the ton, and was only 18 inches thick, but at a higher level the reef was much thicker, and he had crushed as much as 70oz. to a ton, a statement which I can believe from the At a considerable elevation above tbe fence and road there is an extensive table-land, extending northerly, with basaltic rock cropping out over the surface. There are here several prospecting holes being worked, and the prospectors entertain high hopes of the result of their labour. Quartz Reefs.\u2014 Although the quartz miners seem steadily progessing, it would appear, during the present month, that this branch of mining has not been pursued with the usual energy. Those who have applied for leases are awaiting the result, while others hold on until the new quartz crushing-machines are in active operation, expecting that the charge for crush ing will be much reduced.

The other quartz lode is nearly half a mile further up the same gully. There are throe claims now working, and the deepest shaft is only 36 feet, paying from a half to two ounces per ton. If other more important engagements do not prevent me, I will give more detailed information, witii plans of this most important section of my divi sion, in my next report. at the bottom of the shaft, where It was first struck, it is nearly horizontal. Gold has been general through out the claim, in small quantity, namely, from to lioz. per ton. There is no difficulty in excavating it in large quantities, but owing to the great underlay of the reef, and the unworkmanlike manner in which they have carried on their operations, it has never paid re gularly. If a fresh shaft were sunk to the eastward, about 120 feet to 140 feet distant from the present, so as to be able to work the reef from beneath up wards, the labour now expended on winding would at least suffice to bring 10 times the amount of stone to Me surface, and it would pay well. Notwithstand ing the unusual underlay of the reef, the gold is chiefly found on the eastern side, as is the case with all the reefs here, and the principal run of gold was found in the direction of the red dotted lines on the longitudinal section.

Of the Tarnagulla Diggings, I regret to have to report that the lead has not been traced into the flat as yet, in consequence of which the number of miners has dwindled to about 250, but it is the general opinion that it will be ultimately found again, and may yet realise the hope originally entertained of it. Individual alluvial mining is un doubtedly every day becoming a more and more pre carious means of living. Very few are doing well at it, and the generality are scarcely earning a sub sistence ; and this iu the midst of plenty, if efficient machinery were introduced to work our numerous shallow leads and gullies, and the surface on the slopes of the auriferous hills. Public attention is now directed to this, and applications for leases are being Bent in to the Warden by large companies. Two have applied for 25 acres each, at Mount Moliagul. They have chosen, perhaps, the very best ground in this part of the division\u2014 shallow, originally rich, the guld general, the soil easy to wa sh, and plen ty of watershed for reservoirs. The individual miner The following table shows the machines at work and idle :\u2014 has worked it so long that it cannot pay him now, but machinery with suitable reservoirs of water will make it pay splendidly. A company at Sandy Creek has applied for seven acres iu the old lead, with the view of sluicing or waBhing it with the water pumped from Poverty Reef, which is adjacent. On the various reefs in the division operations are being carried on actively, with average suceess. Poverty Reef takes the lead, not only in this district, but probably in the colony. A company has taken up 768 yards by 256 yards on the soutn end of the reef, and of coursethey will erect extensive machinery lor pumping, winding, and crushing, and also for washing the surface, in which the gold is so generally distributed that it would be difficult to find a spot from which a speck or two at least could not be washed from every tin-diBhful of soil. Three other companies have applied for large areas on Specimen, Needful, and on Stony Reefs respec tively, making altogether four applications for reef leases, and three for alluvial mining. The drawings sent are sections of a quartz-claim on Wilson's Reef, Sandy Creek, with a sketch showing the precise locality. Nearly all the reefs in this di vision have a westerly underlay, but the above is very much inclined to the eastward, so much so, that Korong. \u2014 Although these diggings during the month have been considered very dull, a good quan ta of gold has been obtained from several places in old and new ground\u2014 one nugget weighed 61b., and another 161b. Gold has been found lately at consider able distances in the mallee scrub. One gully, situate N. 28 deg. E., one mile and a half distant from Peep-o'-day Gully (indicated as Scrub Rush on the general plan of the district), is being worked by about 30 men, with very favour able results. The depth of sinking is from 2 to 5 feet, and nuggets weighing from -joz. to 8o/.. have been obtained; but the difficulty of procuring water, &c, in that locality will prevent its resources being properly developed. A sum of money (say \u00a3600) care fully expended in constructing a few dams, with neces sary surface-races to collect the storm-water, would enable the miners to reside near their work, and be the means ot opening a large gold-field\u2014 already dis covered. I have no hesitation in saying that gold would be obtained by the ordinary population of Korong in a few months the duty on which would amply repay the outlay. I would beg to allude to the large amount of labour continually lost here\u2014 and on similar gold-fields, where the ground is shallow and the gold patchy\u2014 in conse \"3 ,: \"PS 2 a ,\u00b0& , to -e toS.a 3 a 3 a a v 11 ,\u00ab.s Ed a 3 8. o o o a e.3 Jorong. . iingower Jordan 'a and Jericho .

The vein is very narrow, and considerable time is re quired to procure a ton. German and Bruce's Reefs are rather improving. Good payable quartz has been obtained in a shaft lately bottomed on the latter, but, like other good patches found here, is only of small extent. I think the registering of claims has been resorted to here to an unnecessary extent. During the month 50 tons of quartz have been crushed. Although the machine embraces the latest improvements, as used at Bendigo, &c, it does not meet approval from all the Jericho miners, and other amalgamators are now being added, on which I will be able to report next month. Many of the quartz-miners whose claims are registered are engaged in the old alluvial ground, and are obtaining a Tittle gold. I know of one piece weighing 12oz. having been obtained. Fenton's. \u2014 These diggings are gradually declining. Only a few parties and the original prospectors remain. quence of the oft-repeated digging and removing of headings, soil, &c., by the individual miner, in hopes of obtaining a pillar, or block, where the ground has been rich, or reported as such. This mode of rework ing so much old ground can only be prevented by the ground being properly worked by large companies, after which a stranger, or any one, might see at once that the gold had been extracted. Companies are ob jected to in places where the miner may obtain a few pennyweights of gold when his means are exhausted ; but if he were excluded feoin ground very much dug, ultimately a considerable saving of time and labour would be the result Quartz-mining appears to be shamefully neglected here at present. Only five claims of small extent are at work, and the amount of quartz being raised is very small. Kingower. \u2014 Digging has assumed a better aspect here during the month, in consequence of payable ground having been discovered adjoining the old workings of Hard Hill Gully and Tumblers' Hill. I have seen several nuggets, varying in weight from loz. to 14oz., and heard of many larger ones havingbeen ob- tained at these places. A rush has also taken place at Sawpit Gully, and the prospectors obtained a specimen, containing over 40oz. of gold, previous to bottoming their shaft, which is only 8 feet deep. This gully is parallel to M'Kenzie's Gully, on the west side, and shows indications of being highly auriferous. Quartz-mining is attracting far more attention here just now than it has done during the last four years, and several prospecting parlies are sinking shafts in search of auriferous quartz. About 500 yards have been marked off along the course of the Union Reef. The sinking is supposed to be from 300 to 400 feet ; the great thickness and solidity of the payable reef now being worked in the Amalgamated Company's claim, adjoining, is sufficient inducement to warrant au outlay to a considerable amount on the ground lately marked off. The Amalgamated Company on this reef continue to procure good stone along the ground which had been previously worked They em- ploy at present about 20 men in raising quartz. Their blacksmith's forge has been employed underground during the month without causing the least incon venience to the working, and it saves time formerly lost in sending tools to the surface for repairs. Synnott's.\u2014 These diggings are in a very dull state, but will likely receive a larger population in the summer months, owing to the good supply of water which they command, in comparison to other fields. M'lntyre's. \u2014 Here a good deal of excitement was lately caused, owing to one party having obtained about 201b. weight of gold (including a nugget weigh ing 101b.) in a shallow hole in No. 3 Gully. The old ground is being well worked by Chinese. The Amal gamated Company on Marshall's Reef are now down 100 feet, but have not yet struck the reef. I would beg to remark that the alluvial ground, opened in the district since you received the plans, only amounts to a few acres ; but as soon as anything worth adding is opened, I shall attend to it. In rich ground, many of the diggers sink their shafts, and should they not be fortunate in getting a satisfactory prospect on the bottom, they imme diately leave for other claims. I have known of nuggets weighing 201b. and upwards being found only a few inches from where the presence of gold could not be detected by washing. It is generally very diffi cult to trace the gold at such places as Korong and Kingower diggings, and consequently it is almost an impossibility to work them out. The miners require to be possessed of great perseverance and hope here, in comparison to those at almost any other gold field of half the richness. Jordan's and Jericho. \u2014 These diggings are still in a very dull state, owing to most of the payable quartz leaders having been worked out. Considerable ex pense will have to be incurred in sinking to test the value of the underlying reefs. On Milkman's Reef the prospectors have attained a depth of 70 feet, and are now on the third body of quartz, which contains payable gold. Other five claims are in full work, at depths varying from 50 to 80 feet, without obtaining anything payable. In one of these claims the share holders have put in a drive, at the depth of 60 feet, 14 fe^t into a solid body of quartz, showing every indica tion of being auriferous, but have not as yet seen gold. They intend to commence sinking, should they not get through this body in a few more feet. On Patter son's Reef only the prospectors' claim is being worked. Phlilip's Reef is being abandoned for the present, the prospectors having registered their claim. It is the only claim on that reef which paid anything \u2014 2oz. to 3\u00a3oz. per ton, and that from the surface leader. On Black Reef six claims are at work, but I do not think they are turning out payable quartz at present. Two claims are amalgamated, for the puipose of sinking a deep shaft. Several claims, whose term of registra tion will expire soon, are likely to be re-worked. On Petticoat Reef no quartz is being raised, only one claim being unregistered, or abandoned. The pro spectors, after working out the first vein, have com menced a new shaft to the eastward, in strong hopes of striking a main reef, but, as they require to blast the rock from the surface, it will take months to make much progress. I do not think many shareholders along this line will resume working their claims until such times as the prospectors get the reef.

Twelve leases have been applied for of an aggregate of 6,350 yards in length, and repre senting a capital of \u00a3150,000. The immediate result of these applications has been to attract the attention of our miners, and already eight new reefs, or continu ations, have been marked off, and probably my next report will show a large addition to the present table of quartz-reefs and miners. volves, and holds water for puddhng the stuff, and is a receptacle for the gold which falls into the gravel kept loose by the spikes. The washing-off process is expedited by lowering-gear, which consists of screw wheels and shafts running across the frame-end by means of two crank-handles. The trough and its con tents can be lowered with the greatest ease, and speedily washed out. The machine is driven by a belt {d) off the engine, and from thence to the main shaft of the puddler by strong band-gear.

Quartz Workings. \u2014 Although quartz workings in this division are being prosecuted with great energy, and in many instances with remunerative results, in visiting the many reefs I am impressed with the want of system. At the present time we have little mining, and a great deal of laborious work and useless ex penditure of time and capital, in consequence of the unsystematic modes of working. When an auriferous lode is discovered on the surface, or otherwise, a rush is the immediate result, and on an assumed base line a number of shafts are sunk through hard slate and sandstone, and little attention is given to the bearing, dip, or underlay of the reef. Consequently a large proportion of the shafts are off the reef, and after several months' labour, are abandoned as worthless. A knowledge of the in clination, dip, and underlay of lodes is of the greatest importance in the discovery of continuations. Forest Creek Gold-Mining and Washing Company.\u2014 The machinery of this company is the most compact and complete in this district, and probably in the colony. The principle of the washing-machine is similar to Hart's patent, but it combines several im provements, suggested by experience, to iacilitate its action and efficiency. As this is the first machine manufactured by the patentees, Messrs. Thompson and Fletcher, I forward a drawing and description. [The drawing shows the workings of the mine in relation to the machine, and the mole of washing the stuff.] The machines) is constructed ofround bar iron, seven eighths of an inch in diameter, passed through inter mediate stays or ribs, and strongly rivetted to the ends of the machine, leaving interstices of half an inch between each bar. Spikes (o) are fixed on the exterior of the machines, so disposed as to stir up the gravel in the save-all.

Those for amalgamation are at Eagle Hawk Reef (two Instances), Nuggetty, Bell's, Parkin's, Tiverton, Kangaroo, and Victoria Reefs. The table I enclose is similar to that in the last report, and is gathered from the various proprietors and officials connected with the crushing-machines throughout tho district. The means adopted for ascertaining the numbers of the population were, by persons going over the works and counting them whilst engaged in their occupa- tions. No new rushes have occurred during the month, but a report reached me yesterday that an extension of the rush at Sandy Creek, previously reported, was attracting large numbers to a locality near the Seventy-Foot Diggings. The proprietors of the crushing engine at the Springs (Messrs. Foy and Co.) are now crushing tail- ings from the stuff that has already been crushed, and, I believe, passed under rollers, at the Great Eastern Crushing Company's works, at Eagle Hawk ; and they are getting in some instances lloz. per week merely by submitting the stuff a second time to the crushers, and afterwards to a mill with a revolving pair of wheels, of which there are two in this district. Maldou Gold Mining and Washing Association. \u2014 This company is now fairly at work, having their tram-roads completed, engine in good working order, and lifting and washing stuff. The first week's work gave 10oz., and on the follow- ing week 34oz. were obtained during only four days* work. The Porcupine Flat Gold-Mining Company have their dam excavated, a new cut into the creek formed, and the sluice-head in position ; also a well for tho pump, and a drive 30 feet in length finished. The Beehive Quartz-Mining Association is steadily progressing. New contracts have been entered into for sinKingthe pump-shaft 50 feet deeper, in addition to its present depth of 102 feet 6 inches. The ma- chinery is being erected, and they expect to begin work in a month. The Atlas Association are busy putting up a stamp- ing battery of 12 iron stampers. They are sinking a shaft and draining the reef. They expect to begin crushing in a fortnight. The Lisle's Reef Quartz-Mining Company are en- gaged putting up a 15-horse power engine. The boiler, bed-plate, and the small gear are already fixed. The ground in possession of the company is 920 feet by 400 feet. The Union Company are at work, but are merely crushing top stuff and debris ; for results see table. Manton's Gully Reef.\u2014 This reef was opened three years ago by an American named Rich. For a long time previous Mr. Manton had been living on the reef, where he owned a small crushing-machine, and had for a considerable time been spending money in prospecting the surrounding hills, in search of quartz reefs, little thinking that under his feet a compara- tively rich one existed. Mr. Rich obtained from the first two or three tons 20oz. to the ton, and for a depth of 30 feet the quartz paid well. Altogether about 500oz. were taken from the claim, but the yield falling off, he preferred searching further and leaving tne reef. Never since has anything remunerative been obtained. A small amalgamated company was then started, with Mr. Barclay for its chairman. It consisted of 12 shareholders\u2014 8 paying and 4 working ; but hand-labour being adopted, and the water coming in too fast, returns did not accrue to the satis- faction of the paying shareholders, and the company broke up. A man named Pollock for some time made wages by picking out the best stones, and crushing them with a small hand-machine. Mr. R. Watt also worked for a considerable time, but without success. He then stacked and registered the bank stuff, and lelt the reef. The reef at present opened consists of two spurs, about 30 feet apart, which dip into each other. This led many to suppose that two separato reefs existed. Claims were originally taken up on both, no rule being then in force giving 100 feet on each side to thc original workers. Altogether this"], [96, "26 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. I Table showing thc Yield of Gold at tho Tarrengower Reefs :\u2014 reef has averaged 8oz. to thc ton, and is undoubtedly a fair opening for a company possessed of stcatn machinery. Price's Reef.\u2014 This reef was opened by a Mr. Price, who for some months obtained payable quartz, but not sufficient to encourage prospecting, after the best of it had been extracted. Mr. Robinson, now of Swipers' Reef, was the only other individual who got anything payable, and that only for a short time. At present only one party is at work, and the remune ration is small. Mole's Reef, Long Gully, is supposed by some to be a continuation of Wilson's, and for some months re ceived a large amount of attention, but with no good results. Simmons's Reef, opened by Mr. Simmons, for a little time showed favourably, and has lately im proved slightly. Two or three claims are at work, with an average amount of success. Wages only can be obtained, even with the present moderate rate of crushing. The Muckleford Reefs.\u2014 Some six or seven reefs have been opened at Muckleford ; they are, however, worthy of no especial remark, except Tnornehill's Reef, which was opened in the early part of 1856 by Mr. Thornehill. Some surface-stones promised ex ceedingly well ; indeed, this has been the characteris tic of all ; he Muckleford Reefs. Good stones are nearly always found on tho surface, de lighting the prospectors only to disgust and disap point them in their after expectations. A rush took place on the first stones being discovered amongst the payable claims\u2014 namely, at Brittingham's, Kenwor thy's,'Fisher's, and Down's. The former proved the most lasting, and is still occupied by its prospectors, who have a steam-engine and a dam near the reef. For the first six or seven months about \u00a31,000 were netted from this claim, all the stuff being crushed by Messrs. Woodfall and Co., who at that time owned a machine on the reef. Messrs. Down and Co. sold out to a party of Cornishmen, who erected a machine, and are now being tolerably well remunerated. Messrs. Brittingham and Co.'s stuff averaged about 1-Voz. to the ton. This paid well, as the auriferous part of the reef was of great width. As much as 13oz. to the ton were at one time obtained. This was the excep tion ; loz. was the average. The Blow-up Reef. \u2014 Mosquito and Nuggetty are the other reefs opened in this district, the latter turning out at nrst to its discoverera (Messrs. S. and J. Wood fall) quartz which promised a return of at least lOOoz. per ton. This unfortunately only lasted for a length of 8 feet by about 18 inches in depth. It then com pletely ran out. applications for leases. Capital. Machine 1 Crown Reef Company, Mount Tarrengower, quartz . . \u00a310,000 \u00a32,000 2.

A number i of Chinamen are fossicking about our old alluvial workings ; but I believe most of them are only watching an opportunity to begin sluicing or paddocking. I have the honour to lay before your honourable Board a plan, longitudinal section, and transverse section of Parker's Specimen Keef\u2014 head of Dry Diggings, shown on geological map, No. 1 a, east. Fig. 1 shows the reef cropping out on the surface, at the point G, from whence it was distinctly visible in its southward course 72 feet, where it began dip ping southward 41 deg. from the horizon. In claim No. 1\u2014 the prospecting claim\u2014 the excava tion shown on plan is said to have contained a number of narrow veins or leaders ; those near the surface were the best. A quantity of quartz is there still, which is expected to pay very well to a party having machinery of their own. The claim is said* to have produced upwards of \u00a33,000 for a length of 80 feet. Claim No. 2\u2014 the best on the line, having yielded afl much as 70 oz. per ton near the surface, and having presented to its fortunate owners the handsome sum of \u00a310,000 \u2014 has not been sinking lately. On its first working the best stone was of course taken out, and since then, as thecrushing became lower, the stuff net so rich has been gradually removed. The length of the claim is 60 feet, and the width of reef in the bottom,\u2014 feet below the surface, is 1\u00a3 to 2 feet. A to A is a tunnel and tramway, 45 feet below the surface. B is a screen to sift the stuff before going into the burning kiln C. Claim No. 3.\u2014 D is a tramway, and cut 15 feet be neath the surface, E a screen, and F a kiln. Imme diately below these kilns a tramway is laid, to trans port the quartz to Mr. Wilson's crushing-machine Middleton Creek. In this claim the strike of the reef is 41 degrees to the horizon, and the underlay 57 degrees west. The claim is 45 feet in length, and the produce has been \u00a33,000 or \u00a34,000. 10- 3,200 lineal feet. The only occurrences in mining matters within the past month worthy of remark have been three appli cations for gold-mining leases, made respectively on the 29th and 30th of August ; and I have within the last week surveyed, marked off, and reported on the areas applied for. I am not yet in a position to report anything defi nite regarding the proposed companies, but have recommended the granting of the leases, being con vinced that the ground applied for not only promises a fair return for the capital proposed to be invested by the respective companies, but also that their being worked will tend to promote the commercial and mining interests of the division. The ground is such as to require the outlay of capital, and is not of any benefit to the miner if unworked. No. 1 is an application for 10 acres on Wombat Flat, made by James Williamson ; and No. 2 is for 15 acres on Shepherd's Flat, made by William Parker (both alluvial). No. 3 is made by Dr. Dooney, for 600 yards on Adams' Reef, where, if rumour speaks truly, payable, and even rich, stone was left, in consequence of the flow of water. All three places have been partially worked, and I am inclined to believe that, of all the mining com panies started lately, very few can boast of prospects such as are held out in these instances ; and that Hep burn ultimately (although one of the last in the field will prove not the least profitable for operations on a large scale. I may here mention that the mining community favourably regards the movement, as pro mising permanent employment on ground which, if workable at all by individuals, at best would only pay for a few months in the year. I should not be sur prised to see the example set by capitalists followed up by co-ope ative associations among our working miners. G, the southern shaft, sunk at an expense of \u00a3G0O struck the top of the reef 65 feet beneath the surface, and was sunk 65 feet deeper, whence a drive H, 40 feet west, struck the reef again. The reef was here 1\u00a3 feet to 2 feet wide, and paid l-}oz. to 2oz. per ton It was at that time considered unprofitable, the more so as the flow of water, struck at 125 feet, made 20 gallons per hour. The owners having held it for some time, registered it, and intend to work it again, being very sanguine as to its ultimately proving veiy remu- nerative. The reef has now been opened more than three years, and it is of course difficult to learn any- thing definite at this period ; but my impression is that the best stuff was got in a number of veins near the surface, although plenty of stuff, payable at tho present low rate ot crushing, remains untouched in all the claims. On the same line veins are cropping out on the surface in various places, and I am much mis- taken if the whole will not be taken up before long, as gold has frequently been found in surface quartz, both north and south of these claims. I believe Mr. Wilson, the machine owner, is at present arranging with some of the claimholders for the purchase of their claims. Fig. 2 isa longitudinal section viewed from the east side, corresponding with the line G \u2014 G on fig. 1 ; and fig. 3 and fig. 4 are two transverse sections, east and west, respectively, corresponding with lines K \u2014 K and L\u2014 L. The thickness of reef has varied from 6 inches to upwards of 9 feet, but I cannot learn of its having run out in any of these three claims. In the bottom of shaft G the thickness is about 15 inches. I am convinced that if this reef had been syste matically worked since its first opening, and had ma chinery been on the ground, it would have proved second to none in the colony, and I hope, ere long, to see it reviving. I Mr. Johnson states that the tables are \" the fruits of careful personal observation.\"] As regards mining in general, although satisfactory, I am Btill not able to report any decided progress in any of the various branches. Quartz-Mining. \u2014 I have in my last reports men- tioned that persons were busy prospecting our old deserted reefs, and am truly gratified to learn that one at least\u2014 the Cosmopolitan, from Clunes\u2014 have on Commissioner's Reef (see Geological Plan, No. 2a, east), obtained a prospect which they consider fully satisfactory. I am gratified, because their success seems to bear out my expressed opinion of our reefs, namely, that a thorough prospect could not fail of es- tablishing their value, and because I think that an enterprising company pecuniarily fully in a position to carry out their objects first attaining a footing will soon extend their workings, and by introducing first-class machinery into the district, will facilitate the working of several reefs now deserted. I have not heard of any crushing during the month yielding remarkably, although a number of reefs are being prospected. Puddling and sluicing have not undergone any change during the past month. The water supply has been sufficient, and the yield such as might reasonably be expected. A number of claims have lately been purchased by Chinamen, who seem on the whole to be getting on very well on Jim Crow. Parties of 10 or 12 bring their earnings from other diggings to purcliase sluicing claims here. Tunnelling has remained much the same during the month; no extensive tunnels have broken through the lees; and no new tunnel ground of any extent has been opened. Alluvial Sinking.\u2014 I am told that payable gold has been struck in the lower end of Mr. Morrison's second"], [98, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 28 At Dandenong, by report, there are 100 diggers en gaged, and six persons are prospecting from Caledonia gold-field.

The motive Dower is, steam, five ; horse, nine ; and water, two. The events which I have to report for the past month are but few, but they are of a nature to indi cate a permanent improvement in the mining affaire of this division. Two companies have been formed for the purpose of working two large claims\u2014 one of 41 acres, and the other of nearly 73 acres of quartz ground on One-Tree Hill. This ground has been applied for under lease, and there are the strongest reasons for supposing it to be highly auriferous, inasmuch as it is contiguous to reefs proved to be of the highest value. Operations will commence, no doubt, as soon as the leases are granted, and it will be a lasting source of remunera tive employment to many who are now depending on the precarious results of the tub and cradle. As to quartz-mining, a reference to the table will show what may be considered on this gold-field a great increase in the number of quartz-miners ; and, further, there are but few quartz-reefs now wholly unoccupied in this division, and they are all capable ot yielding a very fair remuneration for the labour invested. A mill site has been applied for in Smith's Gully, near One-Tree Hill, where it is proposed to erect powerful quartz-crushing machinery, which must cer tainly reduce the price of quartz-crushing to its fair value, and thus remove the great obstacle to success in individual quartz-mining. About the 20th ult., a rush took place to a gully running into the right bank of the Yarra, about two miles above Anderson's Creek, called Carr's Gully. About 60 diggers were at work there when I visited that place, but many have since gone away in disgust, after trying unsuccessfully for two or three days. The greatest yield I heard of up to the 27th ult. was about ldwt. to the tub, and this not often, so that I think the place will very soon be deserted. The sinking is from seven to eight feet, of thc usually gravelly clay, and there is about four inches of washing-stuff, resting on hard grey and blue shale. Messrs. Clarke and Bourne are, I am informed, about to resume operations at Thomson's Bend, on the Yarra, as soon as their lease is issued. At the Fourth Hill, Anderson's Creek, Messrs. Moore and Geraghaty are proceeding very rapidly with their operations. Theiropen cutting is completed, aud a tramway laid along its whole length, for the purpose of conveying the headings and refuse from the tunnel, which is now commenced. Mr. Wilkinson's patent calcining furnace is com pleted, and the business of calcining and crushing quartz is only delayed until the brickwork of the fur nace and boiler setting is sufficiently dry to admit o fires being lighted. On the Yow Yow Reefs, namely\u2014 Reed's Reef, Al len's Reef, and Hawkin's Reef, every claim is now occupied, and the minerB are all doing well. Thc average yield of these reefs is about 2-Joz. per ton. I herewith forward sheets No. 6 and 7, illustrative of this division ; and in reference to these, I beg to say that in sheet No. 6, the section line C D is along an indentation in the foot of the hill, which does not form exactly a gully. It has been pretty well worked, and the gold found in it was in nuggety pieces, vary ing in weight from \u00a3dwt. to about loz. On that part of the section line A B lying between the road shown on plan and the Back Creek, gold of a similar cha racter, with pieces of quartz attached, has been found in the workings close by the road, and on tbe slope ot the hill, from which it may be inferred that there is a very rich quartz vein, somewhere on that point of the range.

(Robert Davidson, Mining Surveyor.) The following table shows the quantities of srold ob tained, and the number of men employed by the several companies named, during the month : \u2014 I hare the honour herewith to band you the accom panying table, showing the yield of gold upon the seve ral leads, as far as I have been able to obtain returns, but, at from various causes I have been unable to obtain returns from some of the companies, the figures in it cannot be said to represent the quantity of gold obtained in this division ; still it will be useful as showing the quantity of gold raised in proportion to the number of men engaged in raising it. 1 attri bute the fact of the aggregate yield of gold during the paBt month being less than during former months, to the late swamping out upon the Inkermann Lead, and to the fact that several companies have, during the past month, been detained in consequence of having to repair their machinery ; still, in spite of all these drawbacks, the table shows a return of 8oz. 13dwt. per man for the month. It must also be borne in mind that many of the men are workingold grounds from which it is unreasonable to expect very large returns. Campbell's Diggings. \u2014 Since my last report, the yield of gold in Campbell's Gully has been small, in consequence of a scarcity of water, owing to the miners in that locality having hitherto neglected to construct proper dams for conserving the rain water. There are at present three companies holding claims in the Gully, one of which is engaged in puddling, but owing to the inefficiency of their apparatus, they have obtained but little gold during the past month, though they believe that with improved machinery and a good supply of water,, their claim would yield from \u00a38 to \u00a310 per week per man. They intend to build a large dam during the summer months, with a view of working their claim upon an improved system during the next winter. The other two companies are at present engaged in constructing large dams, intending to erect machinery for puddling on a large scale, and I have no doubt of their success, if the ground be properly worked, for though the wash-dirt is not very rich, there is such a quantity of it, and it is so easily washed, that with good cylindrical puddling-machines, judiciously fixed, and worked by steam-power, success is certain. In a former report I mentioned that a rush had taken place to a hill near Campbell's Gully, known as Learmonth's Big Hill. Since that time a great number of shafts have been sunk \u2014 many without success, as it was at first supposed that it would prove to be a general dig gings ; but, from the fact of the claims from which gold has been obtained forming a line from the pro specting claim, as well as from the position of the reefa and the dip of the auriferous ground, there is every * Swamped out.

There are at the present time two claims getting gold in paying quantities ; but, owing to the scarcity of water in the immediate neighbourhood of the claims, most of the companies are stacking their wash dirt, until a puddling-machine, which is about to be erected m an adjacent gully, has been completed. The general bearing of the lead at present is westward from the prospecting claim, and its depth has increased from 16 feet to 98 feet. The lead is at present leading towards a flat, and if it should be found to continue in that direction, I have no doubt it will become a deep and wet lead. I have examined the surrounding country, and feel confident that a great portion of it is auriferous. On several of these ranges I have noticed out-crops of quartz-reefs, and on others there are all the indica tions of auriferous surface. A few small shafts have been sunk here and there in some of the gullies, evidently for the purpose of prospecting for gold, but inasmuch as those shafts, for the most part, do not exceed 2 feet wide by 3 feet long, and have not been driven (indeed, I doubt whether, in some cases, they have even been bottomed), I do not regard them as any test of the auriferous character of the ground, though I fear they have the effect of deterring many of the miners from prospecting in these gullies. Inkerman Lead. \u2014 The companies at the head of this lead are engaged in working old ground, and /hough the yield of gold therefrom is small, still, in consequence of the large size of their claims, and the length of time they will be engaged thereon, even a moderate rate of wages will remunerate them for their outlay in the purchase of machinery, and their labour in sinking the Bhafts. In one of the deeper claims upon this lead, two explosions of fire-damp have occurred during the past month. By the first of these one of the shareholders was severely, though not dangerously, burnt. Some of the drives in this claim are of a great length, and had been unused for a long time, and though the company had broken through to an adjoining claim for the purpose of ven- tdating the drives, the opening had got stopped up during the time the claims were swamped out ; conse- quently the ventilation was very defective ; it has, however, been remedied to some extent by means of drives. It is of the utmost importance, now that such large and deep claims are being worked, that some im- proved method of ventilating tbe drives should be introduced, otherwise, I fear, many accidents of a similar nature will occur. No. 2 Division. (P. C. Fitzpatrick, Mining Surveyor.) The estimated adult male population is as follows :\u2014 The following table shows the kind and value of the machinery employed : \u2014 The number of alluvial claims is 39, of the total area of 170a. 3r. 7p., giving employment to 92 men. The number of quartz claims is 7, total area 30a. 3r. 38p., giving employment to 55 men. The total value of the machinery is \u00a36,470. I am glad to be able to report favourably of the results of mining operations in this district. At present the majority oi the miners are obtaining good wages, and I know some who receive a dividend of more than \u00a310 per week, and frequently rich deposits are discovered in ground which had been previously worked, but passed over in the hurry and carelessness of the first workings. The prosperity \u00a9f the district is attributable in a great measure to the shallowness of the ground and the plentiful supply of water ; and as a great number of miners wash the auriferous earth in puddling-machines, a large supply of water is always necessary. In the summer this cannot be obtained, so that the miners aie compelled to cease washing with the puddling-machines, and having received permis sion to hold their claims in reserve until the approach of winter, they must seek a livelihood in some other way. Gravel Pits Lead. \u2014 Tbe company, known as Bath's Party, which was working at the corner of Lydiard and Sturt streets, has at length brought its labours to a close. This company commenced sinking in Octo ber, 1855. The company working near the Camp Reserve is also about worked out. This company commenced in February, 1856, and found the gutter in October of the same year, since which time they have averaged a high rate of wages. Golden Point Lead \u2014Some of the claims on this lead have been prevented from getting gold during the past month, in consequence of having had to repair machinery, drives, &c, but judging from the quantity of gold obtained from the east claims on the lead, I anticipate good returns for the present month. Upon the Nightingale Lead nothing new has trans pired during the past month. The Malakhoff Lead appears to become richer to wards the junction, and the other leads within this division are equally good. Quartz-reefs. \u2014 The company on the Township Quartz-reei has nearly completed its crushing -machine, &c., and it is expected that it will be in a position to commence operations in a few weeks. A company has sunk a shaft on the Cemetery Quartz reef, and has obtained some auriferous quartz, which will be crushed shortly. The company on the Milkmaid s Quartz-reef have seen gold in their quartz, hut have not yet crushed any. At the Springs, where there are fewer Europeans, the Chine te for the most part are earning good wages, more, certainly, by their own industry and perse verance than by the richness of the soil. Nearly all of them have obtained their claims by purchase from Europeans, who, though they could not earn wages by working them, yet contrived to sell them to the Chinese for more than they were worth. One case has come under my notice, of a claim held by four men having been sold to the Chinese for \u00a3460\u2014 a sum, I am certain, far above the value of the claim. But yet, with good steam machinery, and a plentiful and continual supply of water, there are few acres in my district which would not make a good return for any outlay. Quartz is now engaging the attention of the miners and capitalists of Ballarat and other districts far more than formerly ; in fact, there has been a decided rush for quartz claims since the 1st of September. This is owing to the increased facility of extracting the geld Chi- nese. Eui -ope: me.

This will give a greater impetus to quartz- mining, if I may judge from the fact of the ground having been taken up by the miners for about half a mile north and south of the Monte Christo Com pany's claim, after it had become known that that company intended to erect large and effective crush ing machinery in the vicinity. And ultimately, and at no distant date, the miners in this district par ticularly must have recourse to the quartz-reefs, and there is no doubt that the alluvial ground will soon be exhausted. thing noteworthy will occur for some months longer, as the parties are all, with one exception, engaged in the arduous task of shaft-sinking, at which some com panies have been unremittingly engaged considerably more than three years ; so that the gutter would need to be unusually rich to remunerate these persevering men for all their tune, expense, and labour. Whim Holes. \u2014 As stated in my last report, all the claims originally taken up on this lead have long since been abandoned, in consequence of an opinion getting hold of some of the miners that it was likely to be patchy, and scarcely payable. Many persons now think otherwise, and the result is, that two large pros pecting claims and two large block claims, in all em bracing 6,800 feet, along the course, or supposed course of the gutter, have been recently taken up. In No. 1 prospecting claim boring has been resorted to, to ascer tain the course of the deep ground, and very probably in a few days the company will have satisfied them selves as to its position, and be able to put down their shaft so as to work the claim most advantageously. The second prospecting party are also about to bore for the deep ground, and, like their neighbours in No. 1, will get the work done by hired labour \u2014 a system now becoming very general here. In addition to the two block claims already mentioned three large old ground claims have been taken up during the month, under By-law No. 10 of the Mining Board, about half a mile south-east of Whim Holes proper, one of which, I understand, is yielding very handsome returns. The sinking is only 8 or 10 feet, and, judging by the disposition evinced by other par ties to take up all along the available old ground in the gully, I think it likely that the place has been found more than ordinarily remunerative. I know one party of four who have lately obtained 301b. of gold after a few days' labour from one small claim 40 feet square, aud I believe other parties have been almost equally successful. A shallow rush took place about 2\\ miles from Paddy's Gully, in a northerly di rection, on the plateau, on the west side of Moonlight Creek ; and though the prospectors and one or t wo other companies are doing pretty well, the greater portion of the population has left, without, in my opinion, sufficiently testing the place. There were not less than from 200 to 250 at this rush about the middle of September, and now I believe the number is not more than 30. It appears that the run of the gold is very narrow, and, as is usually the^case all over the sur rounding country, patchy, which accounts for the un settled state of the population. The Yorkshire Reef, situated between the Black Hill and Little Bendigo, has been proved to be a very valuable reef. Since my last report operations have been carried on to a greater extent, and very satis factory results have been obtained. The prospectors have succeeded in exposing a solid lode of quartz ex ceeding eight feet in thickness, and having found some valuable specimens they have no hesitation in pronouncing it a paying reef.

The claim has been worked for a period of three years, with varying suc cess ; but since efficient machinery has been erected by this party, in conjunction with another, the work has been carried on more systematically. Their earnings are about \u00a38 per week per man. Quartz Workings. \u2014 Staffordshire Keef. \u2014 There is not much to be said of this reef more than was stated in my last report. I have made minute inquiries regard ing the general yield, and find the average to be 17uwt. to the ton. In some cases the returns have been as high as 2\u00a3oz., and in others as low as 2\u00a3dwt. per ton ; and generally it may he estimated that the yield is best at a depth of Jrom 30 to 40 feet. I men tioned in my last that two prospecting claims had been taken up about half a mile southward of Staf fordshire Reef, and I am happy to say both parties have obtained good prospects, and are prosecuting the work with vigour. One shaft is now down 40 feet, and the other upwards of 60. Mr. Cowan has also furnished specimens of quartz from the Llanberris Company, on the Gum Tree-flat. He says \u2014 \" It will be seen that the quartz contains a very large quantity of mundic, or sulphuret of iron. The company has found much difficulty in amal gamating their gold with mercury, which I attribute to the presence of the sulphuret in the quartz. Should your honourable Board be in a position to make public any information on this point, you will confer a benefit upon quartz miners generally.] No. 4 Division. Paddy's Gully, Spring Creek, &e.\u2014 In my last re port I omitted to mention that two prospecting quartz claims had been occupied, one immediately at Paddy's Gully, and the other about a mile northward, at a place known as Hooper's Hill, both of which are being diligently worked, but as yet with no positive result. About 4^ miles from Paddy's Gully, up Moonlight Creek, on the east side, a very promising quartz-reef has been recently discovered by a party working in old alluvial ground, at only 3 or 4 feet from the sur face. As much as Joz. per tub has been washed from some of the debris and casing, and some very good looking specimens obtained.

It is true that the Black Lead had been attempted prior to that date, and a few holei bottomed, but the great outlay caused the works to be soon abandoned. Where the Black Lead and Nuggetty Lead join, the wash-dirt in the Black Lead consists chiefly of loose drift underlying a thin stratum of black clay and sand ; and that on Nuggetty Lead of a ferruginous concrete thickly mixed with detached rounded frag- ments of micaceous sandstone, called by the miners. floating boulders. After the junction, the colour and other properties of the wash-dirt are greatly modified. The depth of the Linton Company's shaft is 117 feet. The thickness of the wash-dirt is from 1 to 2 feet, and the width varies from 20 to 50 feet. The general yield is from loz. to 2oz. per cubic yard. There is a steam- engine and puddling- machine, and the company con- sists of 20 men, who may be justly regarded as the pioneers of deep-sinking at Lin ton's. The John Bull Company have been obtaining gold for nearly 12 months sufficient only to remunerate them. The depth of their shaft is 110 feet ; the bottom is a green micaceous sandstone. The Prince of Wales Company have bottomed, and found tolerably fair prospects. The several companies having now completed their preliminary arrangements, will shortly prove the auriferous capabilities of this extensive district. Should it turn out to be rich (which I think it will), we have before us a gold-field of such magnitude as will take years to exhaust. There are many miles of country to the south and south-west, stretching into the margin of the plains near Woady Yalloak, exhibiting the same geological indications which the spot at present undergoing the test of trial does. On the Standard Lead all are doing uncommonly well. At present gold is being obtained up to No. 10. The depth of sinking ie from 70 feet to 80 feet. The expense of sinking is comparatively insignificant\u2014 neither rock nor much watsr to be overcome. Thirty- five claims arb on the frontage system, and beyond these are five block claims, extending in length nearly three-quarters of a mile. The nature of the strata passed through in the various shafts in the frontage portion of the lead is nearly similar to, and much resembles the Nuggetty Lead, near the junction of the Biack Lead already described. Further on, where the block claims are situate, at a depth of about 40 feet, a thick bed of black clay and vegetable mould is struck, and at the time of my visit nearly 12 feet of this substance had been passed through, and no appearance of its termi- nation. I observed with great interest that the organic structure of the stems and branches of the wood, which constitute the greater portion of this deposit, were distinct and entire, so much so, that in some of the fragments presented to me, decomposition had only commenced. Beyond the block claims no attempt has yet been made to prospect, although the country presents the most inviting appearance. Carngham. \u2014 A few applications for leases have been made adjoining Stone's paddock. The reports in cir- culation respecting the valuable returns from the claims on the private property is placing every availa- blespot in the vicinity in high requisition. The Carngham Company, particularly mentioned in my last report have not yet completed their works. Smythesdale.\u2014 The Roxburgh Castle, North, has upon the whole given -satisfaction, though the returns are in many instances scanty enough. The general average quality ofthe washdirt is rather below the current standard of a payable lead. However, nug gets of considerable value are of frequent occurrence, and these to the lucky finders make amends for the general poverty ofthe wash-dirt The Roxburgh Castle, South, is in a very de pressed condition. The greater number of the claims are at present idle. There are some parties still con- Im^W^r \u2122rk-on it, and others are awaiting the result of such persevering efforts.

The estimated population is as follows :\u2014 Europeans 1,857 Chinese 678 Total 2,535 Machinery. \u2014 There are four quartz-crushing ma- chines, 41 engines, 31 steam puddling-machines, 104 horse puddling-machines, and 37 whims. I have been chiefly gui ied by my registration-books in estimating the population and machinery, and by inspection of -he localities. Accompanying my report I forward a section and plan, showing the position of a new lead discovered during the last month. This discovery was made on the 22nd ult. by the Nil Desperandum Company, whilst working their claim on the Suffolk Lead, at a depth of 188 feet. It is proved to be a tributary, running from the south-west into the Suffolk Lead, and is supposed to have its source from some shallow workings situated on the northern side of the Buninyong Race- course. The width, so far as it has been worked, is 15 feet, containing an auriferous drift 3 feet in thick- ness. The yield of gold up to the end of last month has been upon an average 5oz. of gold to 200 cubic feet of earth. As the ground is easily worked, and the water in a great measure drained by the Suffolk and Black Leads, there is every facility for expeditiously working the claims now taken up. On the deep leads, viz., the Durham, Black, and Napoleon, the various companies are all working steadily, endeavouring to get into the deep ground. The extended areas allowed by the last regulations have given a slight impetus to mining operations generally throughout the district. No. 6 Division. (John Lynch, Mining Surveyor.)

The intervening country consists of a series of precipitous ranges, thickly strewn with fragments of quartz. These ranges have only very narrow gullies between them, and I am of opinion that no great addition to our mineral wealth can be derived from them. With few exceptions, the ground bas not been broken in the search for gold. Linton's Diggings, comprising the extensive section lying between the Hard Hill on the north and the Woady Xalloak on the south, were opened five years ago. Operations were then, and for three years fol lowing, confined to the rich shallow gullies talcing their rise in the southern flank of the Hard Hill alluded to in a former report. The best known of these were Nuggetty, Bloomer's, Wet Flat, and Can dlestick Gullies. Their situation, extent, &c, will be shown on a plan I am now preparing for next month's report. It is entirely within the last two years th at any successful efforts have been made to explore the"], [107, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 7 The Argyle Lead presents a better appearance. All the holes bottomed on it are paying moderately. On Warren's Lead nothing particular has trans pired ; fair wages and a prospect of long continuance would seem to be the lot of the claimholders on this lead. Brown's is in precisely the same condition as at the date of my last report. On the Black Ball Lead the few holes which are bottomed are turning out well. It is well supplied with engines and whims. In the course of another month it is expected they will be able to prove it. | Mr. Lynch has forwarded with his report a large tracing, showing the Black Lead at Linton's, &c] Creswick Division. (James Stevenson, Mining Surveyor.) The estimated mining population is as follows :\u2014 Alluvial miners 2,200 Quartz miners 400 Total 2,600 The machinery is aB follows :\u2014 At work. Idle, Steam-engines, alluvial . . 14 . . 1 Steam-engines, quartz . . 11 . . 3 The most important feature in the transactions of the month in this mining division is the large quan tity of ground taken up under By-law 10 \u00a9f the district. Blackwood Division. (C- B. Longbottom, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows :\u2014 There had just been reported to me the discovery of gold in entirely new ground, and removed from any known diggings. The place is now called the Stony Rises, and is situated about 16 miles north of Creswick, between it and Tarrengower. The prospect Bhown by the discoverers is about lOoz. of coarse shotty gold, of which one piece is a 7oz. nugget. The wash-dirt from which the gold was obtained is white quartz gravel, intermixed with large round and water worn quartz boulders. The depth is about 90 feet from the surface, and has been reached by means of a tunnel instead of a perpendicular shaft. There are no other parties on the ground except the prospectors. Two new leases have been applied for during the montb, both for quartz reefs \u2014 one at Frenchman Gully, Creswick, and south of Evans and Co.'s claim, and the other at Clunes, south of the White Flat Company's ground. The applicants have commenced operations in both instances. The Spring-hill Mining Company have suspended operations, and their lease and plant are about to be offered for sale. From observations made by myself, I believe that a great quantity of their gold escaped \u2014 indeed nearly all the fine gold, and this owing rather to a want of care and attention in the management than from any radical defects in the machinery. Alluvial miners 450 Chinese do 200 Quartz do 220 Total 870 The following is the machinery in use and in course of erection : \u2014 On Simmons'sReef. \u2014 Steam-engines, 2, 18-horse \u25a0power ; water-wheels, 6 ; quartz- crushing machines, 7, with 56 stampers. Trewhella's Reef. \u2014 Steam-engine, 1, 6-horse power ; steam-engine, in course of erection, 1, 12-horse power; water-wheels, 3 ; crushing-machines, 4. Of the latter (the crushing machines) three are driven by water and ene by steam power. Barry's Reef. \u2014 Water-wheel, 1 ; crushing-machine (with four Btampers), 1. Yankee Reef. \u2014 Steam-engine (in course of erection) 1, 8-horse power ; water-wheels, 2 ; quartz-crashing machines, 2. The quartz-crushing machines have 16 stampers, and are driven by water power. Johnson's Reef. \u2014 Steam-engine, 1, 8-horse power ; crushing-machine (with four stampers), 1. There is one horse puddling-machine on the banks of Jackson's Gully in course of erection ; one steam puddling-machine, 8-horse power, on Tipperary Flat ; and there is one horse puddling-machine in Garden Gully. Quartz-mining on Simmons's Reef has, with two exceptions, been looking very well lately. Trewhella's Reef has been at a standstill for some Steiglitz Division. (Thomas Woolgrove, Mining Surveyor.) The estimated population is as follows : \u2014 Steigleitz, engaged in mining, &c. . . 400 Dolly's Creek 1 50 Morrison's Diggings 100 Total 650 time, on account of the abundance of water prevailing on the reef. That this reef is one of the best paying reefs in the division I make no doubt. Barry's Reef. \u2014 From this reef I hear nothing encou raging. Yankee Reef. \u2014 I have not heard anything promising from this reef since my last. Another party have com menced mining operations, and are erecting one 8-horse power engine. St. George's Reef. \u2014 The quartz crushed from this reef has yielded 9dwt. per ton ; but, as the works have not progressed, it is difficult to report about the ulti mate yield. If the reef runs as thick as it is at pre sent, a yield of 9dwt. per ton will pay well. Johnson's Reef remains as before. Nothing of im portance has been struck. The Early-Bird Company have struck the reef, and have seen gold frequently in the stone they are raising. No quartz from their claim has been crushed. The yield from the Golden Point Company's claim has not been very good. This company have found the stone -. better as they sink deeper, and at a depth of 50 feet or 60 feet it has averaged loz. per ton. The Golden Point Company's machine has answered the expectations of the company. [Mr. Longbottom recommends this machine as being effective, and he has forwarded a drawing of it, on the scale of three-quarters of an inch to 1 foot.] In alluvial mining I have nothing of moment to report ; only a few are making wages, and but very few good wages. The best ground is on the banks of the Yankee Gully. Machinery. \u2014 There are 7 steam crushing-machines, of the aggregate of 62-horse power, and 6 steam engines on the claims of the aggregate of 45-horse power. There is also one puddling-machine at Dolly's Creek, and several others in the course of erection. In our transition state during the last month there has been little appearance of progress ; parties hitherto occupied in quartz-mining using buckets and hand windlasses, or machinery of limited power, are now apparently satisfied that this occupation can be fol lowed with the hope of remuneration only by com panies having sufficient capital, aided by proper super intendence, to work more extended claims. Such as have not altogether abandoned their claims, in the meantime have suspended operations, pending the issue of leases, the complete formation of com panies, or the arrival of machinery. The Redan Company, New Chum Reef.\u2014 A few claims north of the above, the Birmingham Reef Prospect Claim, New Year's Reef Prospect Company, Sailors' Reef Company, and Scotch man's Prospect Claim Company have not reached the water level, and still continue hand la bour. The crushing machinery of the Sailors' Reef Company has been in operation for the last fortnight, but they have not yet washed up. The Scotchman's Reef Prospect Claim have just completed their crush ing of 7 tons of quartz, which averagd 4oz. per ton."], [108, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 8 I referred to this reef previously, as having been abandoned for some considerable time. The New Year's Reef Prospect Claim Company are now awaiting the orushing of their quartz. They ex pect very good results from it. The Birmingham Reef Prospect Claim looks as pro mising as the last time I reported. Their last crushing produced 6\u00a3oz. per ton. This was another abandoned reef. The Invincible's Claim, Victoria Reef, have stopped operations, pending the formation of a company to work their ground on a large scale, and with large and effective machinery. The Albion Company, Portuguese Reef, part of whose machinery is now on the ground, intend pro ceeding vigorously with their works next week. The Perseverance Company, Boxing Reef, have com menced operations, and have already reduced the water below the drives at present open, and will in a few days be prepared to erect their pumping machinery, and proceed to drive for new veins, or continue opera tions on those their predecessors have so long followed without remuneration. The population of this district is in a very settled state. Machinery.\u2014 There are eight steam-engines of an aggregate of 75 horse-power, used in pumping and lifting. There are 10 puddling-machines, two of which are idle. The diggings on the Eldorado have been long known to be rich, and several attempts have been made to get down to the gold, but the water has come in upon the workings In such quantities that mere manual or horse power has been found unable to cope with it. With the powerful machinery that has come, and is coming up, a different account will, it is expected, be able to be told of these diggings. The fall of rain during the latter part of the winter has been very small, and fears are entertained that very little more will come ere the summer has set in, in which case, during the middle and latter part of the coming summer, the scarcity of water will be so much felt that it will drive the miners where they can obtain it, as, for instance, to the Buckland and the banks of the Ovens and its tributaries. During the previous part of the winter, heavy rains took place, and I estimated that, in one fortnight, which was very wet, a quantity of water equal to three hundred millions of gallons passed under the bridge at Spring Creek, leading into the town, which went to waste, but if collected in reservoirs, would have been sufficient to provide 12 sluice heads all the year round. Now this water, passing through a long scat- tered set of diggings, such as this district is composed of (being about 24 miles in length), can be used a dozen times over before it leaves the auriferous ground. This would give 144 sluice-heads, which, at four men to each sluice, would thus employ about 600 men all the year round. This shows the incalculable value of water, which weuld justify the country in de- voting a great deal of its energies and capital to obtain and preserve the same. The prospecting claim at Bowman's Forest does not seem to have turned out so well for the last two or three weeks, as it did previously. This may be easily accounted for from the evident irregularity of the bed rock (which is Bandstone) in one place rising up per pendicularly to about 10 feet, and passing over a stratum of gravel. Also, in the fact that the bed rock in a claim that had been worked for six or eight months back, about 150 yards nearer the ranges, is upwards of 130 feet above that in the prospecting claim ; therefore there is every reason to believe that further down the lead, where the dip will be much less, the gold <rill be found in greater quantities. The Steiglitz Company have accepted tenders for fitting up the main engine shaft, and the contractors are proceeding vigorously. I believe their machinery is to be on the ground in a few days. The Malakhoff and Gibraltar claims, which have the most efficient machinery, and which are working the deepest ground yet reached on this field, continue active operations. From the new ground lately opened the Malakhoff Company has obtained some of the richest specimens of auriferous quartz yet seen in their ground, while the general appearance for some time has been most encouraging. They are now crushing, and will soon know the result of six months' labour. The new crushing machinery of the Gibraltar has been in operation for some time, and has nearly ex hausted the many hundred tons of quartz bi ought to the surface. The yield taken throughout has ave raged from 2oz. to 4o\u00ab. per ton. Old German Reef, now called the Wellington Min ing Company, have as yet taken no progressive steps on their ground. This reef has averaged 2oz. to the ton, and has been steadily worked for a long time. Alluvial Mining. \u2014 At Morrison's Diggings, on the Moorabool, the miners are taking up extended claims under by-law X., and forming large companies to v/ork the ground in a proper manner. The face of the hill extends nearly a mile along the river. Gold has been found throughout in different quantities, and there are many thousand loads of alluvium which will pay companies where it could not be remunerative to individual miners. The Moorabool Goldwashing and Water Company have not commenced their operations yet. On Dolly's Creek diggings the same system is being adopted as at Morrison's. Seven large claims have been taken up, and application made for measuring off more. Snake Valley Division. (Thomas G. Kennan, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Europeans. Chinese. Alluvial miners . . . . 1,700 . . 860 There are three puddling mills at work and one idle. Note. \u2014 The machines are from personal observation ; the population from the police reports. I estimate that there are 300 Europeans and 100 Chinese engaged otherwise than in mining. The greater part of the Nine Mile Creek, partial' larly the lower end, has been taken up by parties who intend re-working it. From the means employed to re-work it, viz., that of deep-tail races, also the large size of the claims granted, in conjunction with the reduced state of wages, it is Bure to prove remunera tive. The extreme dryness of the season will also prove of great advantage, as there will not be so much irater to contend against. On the other hand, the extreme dryness begins to tell very unfavourably on the hill-sluicers, their supply being in some in stances considerably reduced, and in others totally lOBt for the present. The Leviathan Company, since my last report, ha changed hands, and re-appears as a public company under an old name\u2014 namely, the Ovens Gold-fields Water Company. The members of the old Leviathan still continue at work, and are progressing very satis The hills in this locality are covered from the surface to about 4 feet in depth with auriferous deposits, which will pay well if worked on a large scale.

The water Etill continues to increase at the south end. This is the first public mining company started in this district. There is payable ground to be found in this district for years to come, provided a good supply of water be obtained ; and, in my opinion, nowhere would ca pitalists find a greater field for investment than in this district. The population is settled, and there is only a very slight change in the numbers, chiefly in regard to the Chinese. Indigo Division. (Thomas E. Thornely, Mining Surveyor.) The estimated mining population is as follows : \u2014 Alluvial mining and prospecting . . 4,019 Quartz crushing 10 Quartz mining 57 Total . . . . \" . . 4,086 The total population is as follows : \u2014 Europeans 5,214 Chinese 1,025 Total 6,239 Machinery. \u2014 There are 2 quartz machines at work and 1 idle, 27 puddling machines at work and 1 idle, 16 whims, 70 whips, and 7 steam-engines at work, of the aggregate of 67-horse power. There is not much to add to my last report in regard to the Indigo Main Lead. Some holes are bottomed above Pole's prospecting shaft, and, generally speak ing, the reports are very satisfactory. The upper part of the lead still affords a subsistence to the Chinese, who are working headings and tailings ; and the centre part of it is almost exclusively occupied by them, with the exception of a few parties of Europeans, who are working extended claims of abandoned ground. Caledonian Lead.\u2014 The upper part of this lead has not by any means met the expectations of the claim holders. Many claims have been abandoned, as the ground is very patchy, and for want of water to prove the ground properly. Several holes lower down the lead, towards its junction with the Indigo Main Lead, have yielded better prospects, and the general belief is that this part of the lead will aflord profitable em ployment to the men for some months to come. The width of the lead or gutter has not yet been proved. The dirt is about one foot in thickness, and averages Idwt. to the oil or nail can. Durham Lead. \u2014 This is a new lead, about half a mile to the north-west of the Caledonian, and will even tually run into it. The prospecting abaft is 170 feet in depth, and the prospects obtained average from 1 to 2 dwt. of coarse gold to the oil or nail can. The lead is not yet defined, several shafts having bottomed on the reef. Stockyard, New Ballarat, and Chiltern Leads. These leads form one continuous lead, taking different names, according to the localities. The upper part (Stockyard) is about worked out, and large heaps of dirt are paddocked. The New Ballarat Lead has been worked out, as far as the original claims are concerned ; but the ground is now being rewerked by parties who have taken it up as abandoned ground. Thence to the Nil Desperandum claim the lead will soon be proved, as several shafts are now being sunk. The lower part (Uniltern) is not yet sufficiently proved. The Alliance Company have struck gold, and report prospects of 2oz. to the cart-load, with a thickness of 2_ feet of wash-dirt on the verge of the gutter. They have been since occupied in opening their drives, and sinking a well-hole. Suffolk Lead.\u2014 The lower part of this lead still con tinues to pay well, and will take several months to work out. The Black Ball and White Star Companies both employ engine power. On the upper part of the lead they are working out their claims, which are still pay ing good wages. Scotchman's Lead.\u2014 Under this name a new lead has been proclaimed. It is about half-a-mile north west of Sebastopol. The prospects obtained were of coarse gold, averaging from _ to 2\u00a3 dwt. to the oil or nail can, from wash-dirt 12 inches in thickness. Quartz. \u2014 Several leaders have been found during the last month, but only the surface quartz has been crushed, which on the average turned out well. Of the two machines now at work, Chalmers and Com pany's has averaged 2oz. to the ton, and Abbott's loz. to the ton. Neither of these machines have been kept nearly employed. The scarcity of water in this immediate neighbour hood has been a serious drawback to the well-doing of the miners, and accounts for the temporary falling off of the escort returns. During the last month, the quantity of rain fallen has afforded no water for mining purposes, and the consequence is that large heaps of wash-dirt have accumulated on all the leads.

It has been opened from the surface all along the line, but has attained a very slight depth. The reef is opened from the surface, and the gold in the stone is in very payable quantities.

These returns, and the richspecimensexhibited from time to time, have induced a company to lease a large extent of the ground to enable them the better to search for the reef, which must be very rich, and will probably be discovered at a great depth below the surface. Break o' Day Reef was opened by Brown and party three or four years ago. It is situated at the head of Break o' Day Gully, on the main dividing range to Kangaroo Flat, or water-shed of Bendigo, and lies about due west from Kangaroo hamlet. This line has been opened only to the extent of 150 yards along the reef. The principal shafts are those worked by Brown and party, one of which is suuk to a depth of 143 feet, at which depth a water vein was cut through in the quartz, and the water rose rapidly to a height of 40 feet in the shaft, which caused them to abandon the claim for want of efficient machinery to keep it under. 20oz. to the ton have been obtained here. A company is being formed to work this line with powerful machinery for pumping and crushing, and a good capital for further workings. Stafford Reef, Tin-pot Gully. \u2014 This line is a new one, and consequently is very little known as a gold bearing reef. Some very rich stones have been ob tained from many of the claims to tbe northward, and specimens that have been exhibi'ed as having come from this line have been exceedingly prolific, and promising to the claimholders a future rich line. There has been a new reef discovered on the Axe Golden Gully.\u2014 Glasgow and Carshalton Reefs.\u2014 The Glasgow line has been extensively worked, and was very rich ; and tt Is being taken up by large com panies on an extensive scale.

The alluvial workings in this division throughout the various gullies are, *up to th's date, confined entirely to horse puddling-machines, of which there are in my division no less than 288 ; 62 of these are idle, having been purchased by public companies, in order to secure the sites upon which they stand for their steam -puddling purposes, for which no less than 250 acres of alluvial ground have been applied for by lease, the greater portion of which will not pay indi vidual laoour, but cannot fail to handsomely remu nerate the companies when established, and greatly swell the escort returns. There are no deep alluvial workings in this division. The ground has all been often turned over, in consequence of being so shallow. Creek, about 16 miles from Sandhurst, which cauBed much excitement, and consequently a rush took place to the spot, and now about a mile of the reef is taken up in claims, about 30 of which are busily working. The stone was discovered on the surface, aud gold was seen in it. I found several kilns of atones stacked ready for burning, and discovered gold in all of them, and should say they would yield about 5oz. to the ton. Quartz-reefing is very \"briskly carried on in this division, there being 14 well-kuown and well-defined leads, the principal of which are \u2014 the Sarnia Reef, which crosses the ranges between the Spring Creek and the Sheepwasb. It is extensively taken up along this line, and several of the shafts have struck gold in large quantities. This, I feel positive, from its posi tion and general appearance, will eventually become one of the best leads iu this district. The Glasgow Reef, which crosses Golden Gully at its source, is, I can safely say after having surveyed it, a continuation of the Diamond Hill Lead. It has been extensively worked and taken up in claims for about two miles along the line. Many of these claims have stopped working, in consequence of the quantity of water they had to contend with, which was struck at a depth of 150 feet. The whole of the claimholders have, however, joined in forming a company, for the purpose of pumping and draining the whole line of reef. No. 2, oa Bendigo Flat Division. (William Jahn, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 There is also the amalgamated Glasgow Reef Mining Company, comprising about 10 of the most southerly claims on the reef Some very rich stones were taken from one or two of these claims in patches. They have also a good reef at the water level, and the stone is of very fair quality. Sheep's Head Reef viubly crosses Bendigo Flat, and runs along tbe range which divides Sheep's Head Gully from Golden Gully. This line has been well worked to a certaio depth, and much gold taken therefrom. The northern portion is taken up by a lease, and will, I have no doubt, be found a very rich line when capital is brought to bear upon it. The number of puddling-mills is 160.

Clissold's machine, distant a few yards from that just mentioned, is not in work, and has not been for some time. The level on which it is placed is so low that the utmost difficulty is ex perienced in getting rid of the sludge, and on the oc casion of every flood the plant is swamped. The ex pense of working it, therefore, makes it almost use less. This, I believe, was one of the first crushing machines erected on this gold-field, and the principal of its stamps has outlived the various improved modes of crushing which were subsequently introduced. The engine of Messrs. Gibbs and Lazarus, New Chum Gully, is not at present working. Eagle-Hawk Division. (G. W. Hart, Mining Surveyor.) From the tables furnished by Mr. Hart it appears that the mining population in his division is as fol lows :\u2014 European puddlers 780 Chinese puddlers 40 Tub and cradle men . . . . . . 259 Men employed at crushing mi Ils . . 152 Miners at Epsom 300 Miners at Huntly 3,000 4,531 There are 195 mills at work, owned by Europeans, and 50 idle, and there are 10 at work owned by Chinese. There are 19 crushing mills. [Mr. Hart says : \u2014 \" The returns made to me of the number of persons engaged in mining on the reefs arenot yet sufficiently complete. Ihe preceding statement refers to the alluvial miners only.\"] Plan No. 1 represents a prolongation of 2 miles ot the line of Paddy's Gully Reef, bearing N. 26 deg. W. (for the first part of which I beg to refer to my report and plans for the month of July) and the places where the outcropping quartz is clearly visible. Through the whole of the township of Eagle Hawk the reef is lost, but it is again traceable on the rising ground to the north of it. As may be seen on the plan, a shaft now registered has been sunk near the spot, and as the greater part of thisground is covered with thick scrub it is probable that it has never been visited by the prospector. The continued absence of rain has had an adverse effect on the puddlers. The rainfall during the winter was unusually small, and it is now some time since the dams have been replenished. The\" Long Gully and Back Creek Mining Com pany are pushing tneir works ahead at the Back Creek with the utmost vigour. The boiler is already fixed in its bed of masonry, and the base of the stack is complete. The works are situated on an elevated portion of the ground. An area of some 50 acres or 60 acres his been taken up by the company for a re servoir, in the Flora Reef Ranges, about a mile from their works. The spot selected affords a large capa city for retention with an adequate water-shed. The embankment is 430 feet long, with a maximum breadth at the base of 70 feet. The extreme height is about 28 feet. Plan No. 2 represents the group of shafts of the Nelson Reef, with a longitudinal section thereof, giving the depths of the shafts and of the water-level. This line, the bearing of which is N. 24 W-, when fol lowed out will, I imagine, run through some already well-known leads. The short parallel line to the eastward of the main line shows the New Eastern Reef of the Nelson, recently discovered by driving in an easterly direction, at a depth of 160 feet, in the claim of Messrs. Anderson and Co. Until the present time it has been reached by none other, though several miners are in search of it. This is the same Eastern lode mentioned in my report for July. In reference to quartz mining there is nothing of moment to call for especial remark. Operations are suspended at the Black and White Leads, New Chum Gully, pending the conclusion of arrangements for working them on a more systematic plan. The absence of steam power to drain the reef is an obstruction, which has brought the miners of Paddj's Gully Reef to a standstill. I am informed that the Paddy's Gully Mining and Pumping Company is progressing favour ably, but personally I know nothing of it. Some time since, a powerful engine of 35-horse power was placed by Mr. M'Dougal on the Victoria Reef, for the purpose of draining the same. The task was a heavy one, but has been attended with com plete success, and the owners of the adjacent claims are now working with redoubled vigour. The engines of Messrs. Luffsman and Sterry, the Medway Company, and Messrs. Wittscheibe and Com pany are in full work, and give good results. The Ironbark Company have a large body of water in their workings, and their engine is constantly em ployed pumping. Mr. Considine, in New Chum Flat, I have aho the honour of laying before the Board of Science a tabular account of the mining population, &c , of my division\u2014 a plan of which I am now pre paring; and I find by tbe returns made to me that many of the puddlers have disposed of their property to applicants for leases of alluvial ground, and also that some owners of quartz claims have had recourse to amalgamation lor the more effective working of the reefs. A small portion of the machinery re- quired for steam-puddling has arrived in the district, but none of it has yet been put into working order. In the mean time some few of the puddling-mills are either permitted to continue their operations, or the purchasers have undertaken the working of them until the steam machinery can be brought into operation. . Puddling by horse-power is, however, greatly carried on in the smaller gullies and flats with which my division abounds, and it is probable that it will so continue, as the yield of their contracted areas would be too insignificant for steam puddling, and would Do Do Victoria Reef, Long Gully Long Gully Derwent Gully . .

(John Breen, Mining Surveyor.) The population at Whroo is as follows : \u2014 Puddlers 158 Maryborough Division. (D. O'Leary, Mining Surveyor.) Tub and cradle miners 55 The estimated population is as follows : \u2014 Maryborough. A lluvial miners 970 Quartz miners 120 Quartz crushers 8 Quartz- reefers 76 nese 70 3S9 There are 63 puddling-machines. There are two steam quartz-crushing machines \u2014 the one of four, and the other of 12 horse power \u2014 both idle at present. In consequence of the great scarcity of water, pud dling operations are carried on in an unsatisfactory manner, as the machines can only be worked when, at intervals, they obtain a supply of water. The average yield of gold in alluvial workings is three quarters of a dwt. to the load. Reefing is bemg carried on actively in this locality. In all cases where the lode has been struck the results have been very satisfactory. The depth sunk on Balaclava Hill is now nearly 300 feet. Mr. Lewis, the proprietor of one claim on it, continues to work it energetically, keeping about 40 men employed. At 285 feet a rich lode was struck, and latterly, in another part of the claim, at 220 feet. The average bearing of the north and south lodes in the neighbourhood of Balaclava Hill is N. 23 deg. 30 min. E,, and these are intersected by an east and west one, 15 feet thick, of very auriferous indications. In my opinion this is a continuation of the Albert Reef, bearing 4 degrees north of east, dipping northerly, and extending from Balaclava Hill in an easterly direc tion for more than a mile. The Albert Reef gives every promise of being one of the richest in the Goulburn ; the yield has been 12oz. to the ton wherever the auriferous vein has been Btruck. Very little has been done in the way of prospecting. There are at least 20 square miles, lying between Whroo and the River Goulburn, presenting eminently auriferous indications, most of which no attempt has been made to prospect. The population at Rushworth is as follows : \u2014 Puddlers 320 Tub and cradle miners 110 Quartz-miners 175 Chinese 390 995 There are two steam quartz-crushing machines ef 14-horse power, one of 12-horse power, one of 5-horse power, and one of 6-horse power. There are 135 pud dling-machines. In consequence of a scarcity of water, not more than half the machines are permanently at work. The average yield of gold in the alluvial work ings is about 1^ dwt. to the load. For a long time quartz-reefing has been carried on in a very apathetic manner; lately, however, the quartz-miners are be coming more enterprising, from the stimulus im parted by a few companies who are about to introduce capital, and also by the knowledge of rich yields in the neighbourhood. Of 23 reefs that are being worked, 18 of them are east and west, and 5 run north and Bouth. Chinaman's Hill Reef, bearing 21 deg. north of west, and dipping to the north, has averaged 7oz. to the ton since it was first worked, and lately from one bucket of stone 180oz. have been taken, and 265oz. from another. The Canadian Reef, one of the first opened, is paying now 6oz. to the ton. 1,038 Amherst. Alluvial miners 8,850 Quartz miners . . . . . . . . 110 Quartz crushers 54 9,014 The population appears somewhat settled, and in mining matters generally, during tbe present month, there has been little new to communicate, except an oceasional stir created about a few applications for mining leases, which in the Maryborough division, it would appear, have recently been systematically op posed. Alma.\u2014 This gold-field, once the favourite in the Maryborough Division, has been unaccountably de serted for the last 10 months. Only one company, comprising 18 hard-working men, could be seen for the past eight months, combatting, with a small engine, the strong current of water so weil known in the Alma Flat. Those persevering men, notwithstand ing the inefficiency of their engine, succeeded last week in striking payable gold. However, the miners of the Enterprise Company, with their limited resources, did not feel equal to the task before them, and therefore concluded to re-organise their company, and at the same time to invite the co-operation of some capi talists, who, it appears, gave the proprietors prompt attention, resulting in an application for a lease of 25 acres of the Alma Flat, which is now under considera tion. Chinaman's Flat.\u2014 This flat has only as yet another company similar to the Alma, but more successful. They have placed their little plant about the middle of the old lead, and have been realising weekly (from information received si om one of the company) from \u00a33 to \u00a35 per man. At the lower end of this old lead, and approaching the Bet Bet Creek, the miners have failed in tracing the lead any further, in consequence of shaving been overpowered with water. 25 acreB of this portion of Chinaman's Flat is now about to be leased by a company started by a Mr. Sim from Sandridge. The speculation cannot fail to prove a sure investment for this new company, for with the assistance of efficient machinery, the lead will no doubt be again discovered, to the existence of which many miners here can bear testimony. At Maryborough there is an engine of 12 horse power, crushing 60 tons weekly, and the average yield per ton is l\u00a3 oz. There are also two engines in course of erection. At Amherst there are eight engines ofthe aggregate of 139 horse-power, crushing 530 tons weekly\u2014 average yield per ton, l\u00a3oz. There are three other quartz-crushing machines in course of erection at Back Creek, and others are much needed, as near Bradshaw's station and Cockatoo Gully, where new reefs have recently been dis covered. There is no alteration since my last report in the steam-pumping engines ; there are only seven, of the aggregate of 106-horsc power. Six are at work, and one is idle."], [113, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 13 No. o puddling-machines at Amherst . . 00 f\u00bb \u00bb Maryborough . . 195 These tables comprise only those actually engaged in mining. The total population I estimate at 7,500, being the result of my own observation. I have no important change to note in any part o the district this month, except the opening-up of two new quartz-lodes \u2014 one at St. Arnaud, and the other about 2k miles west of the Avoca township. The for mer is a continuation of what is known as Shewring's Reef, situated near the old alluvial working at New Bendigo. I visited these workings a few days ago, and found that about 40 claims were marked. Tbe lode is about 18 inches thick, and the appearance indi cates a yield of about 4oz. to the ton. Out-croppings of this reef may be observed in many places, from what is termed the Gap Reef to the old alluvial work ings, a distance of 1\u00a3 miles, where a belt of low ranges with innumerable quartz veins is lying immediately between very extensive high sandstone and hard slate and schist ranges. The other quartz-lode is situated immediately at the base of the Pyrenees. Upon one of the contiguous ranges 30 claims have been marked out. The pros pectors have worked their claim to a depth of 10 feet. The auriferous stone is about 15 inches in thickness, and indicates a yield of about three ounces of gold to the ton. This part of the district, for several miles north and south of this lode, as yet is quite untried, and a more auriferous-looking part for quartz it is impossible to conceive. At the Amphitheatre mining in rather dull, many having left for the Fiery Creek and other diggings. At Petre's Diggings the population is slightly on the increase, the sinking yet being easy, and all ap parently are making a good living. This part of my district, comparatively speaking, is quite new ground ; and eventually I expect to see this, with St. Arnaud, become an extensive and important gold-field. 495 Quartz- Reefs.\u2014 From present active indications as to quartz-reefs, no doubt I will have to record in my next report treble the number engaged at present in this branch of mining. The Maryborough Quartz-Crushing and Sluicing Company is making preparations on an extensive scale. Active operations will be commenced in a few days, when the erection of the machinery will be com pleted ; then the hitherto inexhaustible body of water in the Mariners' Reef will be brought into use, as it is intended to sluice some of the adjoining gullies witk the water thus obtained. White Horse Reef. \u2014 This is second in importance to none in this district. On it there are two claim* leased \u2014 viz,, to Paton Brothers, and Costick and Co. It is situated north-west of Amherst. The Company now known as the Amherst United Quartz-Reef Company has not been slow in its opera tions. On the claim is erected a 35 horse-power steam engine, from P. N. Russell and Co., of Sydney, with a large Cornish boiler, winding gear, and a battery of eight stampers,\u2014 cast iron wipers, and a wrought-iron axle\u2014 amalgamation by grooves and shaking- tables, capstan and shears, and attached is a one-horse whim. The engine-shaft is 7\u00a3 feet by 4 feet in the clear, and is now sunk to a depth of 196 feet. It is divided into two compartments for pumping and winding, and is admirably secured all the way down with divided frames. [Here follows a description of tho plans relating to the workings on this reef.] Mia Mia Reef. \u2014 This reef, though not many months discovered, ia considered one of the best paying reefs yet known in the Amherst Division. Quartz has been found in one shaft (No. 2 north), which pays from the surface to the present depth of 35 feet, from 5oz. to 7oz. per ton. The reef is situated at the head of Mia Mia Flat. Dunolly Division. (R. J. M'Millan, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 In the ranges between the Mia Mia Reef and Brad shaw's Station many valuable reefs have recently been discovered, the surface quartz, in which, I am informed on reliable authority, will pay half an ounce to the ton. It is to be regretted that some efficient system of prospecting has not yet been practically encouraged. Avoca Division.

A rush has, however, taken place to the Hard Hills, Sandy Creek, on which a population of 800 is profitably employed, and the number is fast increasing. These hills are situate nearly three miles north of Tamagulla township, and on the east side ot the flat. They have been worked at intervals for the last three yeara, several small rushes having taken place to them. The sinking varies from surfacing to 40 feet in depth. The Tamagulla or Half-way Diggings have not im proved. The lead- is lost for tbe present. The popu lation, about 200, are mostly employed in working out the claims they secured when the rush to it took place.

At Moliagul, Wattle Flat, Bulldog, and Inkerman, a gocd number is at work at alluvial mining, chiefly in old ground, and most of them are doing very little ; but occasionally a fine nugget is got in Spark's Gully and Nuggetty Point, both of which are at the base of the mount. On Waymau's Reef the prospectors are obtaining very rich quartz, but the lode is notof great thickness. The Queen's and Hogarth's Reefs have suspended operations. They are fixing up a 25-horse power engine. Their last crushing was 15dwt. per ton. The Oak Reef claimholders have formed them selves into a company, and intend putting up an en gine. The prospecting claim has crushed l\u00a3oz. to the ton. A new reef, name not known, has been dis covered at Nuggetty Point, at the foot of the mount, from which the prospectors have crushed 6oz. per ton. At Cochrane's there is a population of 200, all getting a little gold, in general in small quantities and water is getting scarce. Korong Division. (John Catto, Mining Surveyor.) The estimated population is as follows : \u2014 the Loddon, have an aggregate population [of about 250, very few of whom are doing well. The reefs are the mainstay of this part of the divi sion. They are steadily being developed, machinery is increasing every month, and more improved me thods of conducting mining operations are being adopted. Quartz-crushing is now done at a cheaper rate than formerly\u2014 18s. per ton is the current rate over 20 tons. On Poverty Reef, which continues its extraordinary success, a pumping and winding engine of 20-horse power is in course of erection by Messrs. Beynam and Co., on the north end ; and on the south end the Poverty Reef Mining Company are making prepara tions for the erection of n achinery, which is on its way from Melbourne. They have called for tenders for an engine-shaft on the reef, and are about to com mence work on the blocks of alluvial ground they have leased. Specimen Reef has so improved that the claimholders cannot be induced to throw their interests into a com pany at any price. Six claims are getting gold, vary ing from foz. to 5oz. per ton, and the reef is about 6 feet in thickness. Stony Reef, situated between Poverty and Specimen Reefs, and believed to be a con tinuation of them, has three payable claims on it. A company has applied to lease 650 yards here. Sabbath Reef continues its yield of 3oz. to 4Joz. per ton to the prospectors, and to them only, and the reef is increas ing in thickness as it deepens. Stubbs' Reef, .parallel with Specimen Reef, and about 400 yards west from it, is giving 5$oz. per ton to one claim. Needful's, Watt's, Great Western, Victaria, Ironbark, Baker's, and Glamorganshire Reefs are paying moderately. The Corfu crushed l,040oz. from 8 tons of quartz, and it continues to give stone of the same quality. On Wilson's Reef 'and on the Greek s Hill companies are being formed by the claimholders themselves. They find that without machinery they cannot^make lOdwt. to 25dwt. per ton pay at a consider able depth, and this amount of yield is very general in both these reefs, which are connected. The Antrim, Durham, Montebello, and Hellas are discoveries during the month. The three first have good pros pects, and the last has crushed 9\u00a3oz. per ton. They are all in proximity to the Corfu. At Cay's there are not above 150 men employ d in alluvial mining. The;rush to the Hard Hills, nearSa dy Creek, has. taken man} of them away. The Kangaroo Reef is again looking up. v i claims are getting gold. On the American Reef.t ho upper or surface reef, as it is termed, is nearly worked out ; but several claims are going down, in ex pectation of striking again at a greater depth, but the water is a great obstacle. On the Woolshed one claim is getting gold. Six claims are at work, but no de fined reef has been found. Specimen is almost de serted, the prospectors alone being at work. Jones's Creek is exceedingly dull. Mining has never been in such a depressed stale in this place before. The population is about 150. A company is about to take up Canadian Reef, and erect an engine on it. At Dunolly, including Burnt Creek and the Bet Bet, there is no improvement in alluvial mining. The various persons in the Wet Lead, including the Engine Company, are not making wages, and the same is the case in the dry sinking. The Engine Company, on Gooseberry Hill, Burnt Creek, are, however, an excep tion, as I am informed they are doing very well. But quartz-mining is impioving in this part of the division. On Perseverance Reef \u2014 the must important -five claims are obtaining payable gold. The yield is \u00a3oz. to 5oz. per ton, and the reef is from 6 feet to 7 feet thick, and easily worked. On the Belgian two claims are at work, and both are paying. On Lee's Bridge Reef a company of 12 have taken up this long abandoned reef, and are erecting a windmill for crushing purposes, the tower of which is to be 80 feet in height. They will also have a small engine for pumping and winding. Murphy Reef, Burnt Creek, is paying the prospectors. The Bet Bet Reef is entirely idle. The Spread Eagle is getting out The machinery iB as follows: \u2014 Korong.\u2014Mining affairs during the month have been rather dull, very little new ground having been discovered. A few small patches of auriferous ground have been opened, but the scarcity of water is be ginning to affect the miners already, and as the Bum mer advances the evil will increase, unless rain be more abundant than usual in this neighbourhood, \u2022\u00bb the outside gullies and the \"mallee scrub\" are the principal places of attraction for prospecting, and they being naturally of a very dry character, makes it im possible for tbe majority of miners to proceed so far to their daily toil, even if water was not necessary for washing purposes ; consequently many of the miners may have to remove to other fields, where water i\u00bb m\u00b0re readily obtained, irrespective of the yield of gold. The attention of capitalists has been directed to this field lately, and a large portion of the old Locality. ?S2 2.3 <a \u00bb a. a b Sp a\"? a 16 80 96 .3 rt o 3 3 o 1600 260 70 7\" 30 130 2160 160 46 24 3 3 4 240 1526 Corong iingower Jordan's and Jericho Synnott's fenton's kTlntyre's l'.n 4 196 Totals 2241' Locality. ,-9 a oj j> | g-\u00a3 53 P if s -- Um- is -o P 3 CO V \u00a7 o la 35 I\" 3 9s is \u00a3.5 =1 H Ba 1 3 iorong tingower tordan's and Jericho . .

Kingower.\u2014 During the present month nothing has been discovered to cause any unusual excitement. From the small rush at Saw-pit Gully (mentioned in my last report) several miners have obtained good re turns for their labour. Oue nugget weighing 76oz. was procured, which is the largest I know of. Gold has been obtained in a vein at the head of Poverty Gully ; and, judging from the number of claims marked out, I think the whole range from the head of Long Gully southward will be prospected. When any definite vein or reef is discovered I shall forward you a tracing of the same. On the Union Reef operations are being carried on throughout all the old workings. The Amalgamated Company's claim is still yielding satisfactory results. The new ground marked off adjoining this claim has been surveyed, and application made for a lease. Should such not be granted the shareholders are so sanguine of success that they are prepared to expend a large amount of capital on the security of their miners' rights. Fenton's. \u2014 These diggings have continued without any improvement during the month. Nothing worthy of report has been discovered by any of the pros pectors around. Synnott's. \u2014 Mining affairs have not improved here since my last report was forwarded ; but on account of a good supply of water being convenient to the workings an increase of miners may be expected during the summer months, and new ground will, in all probability, be discovered. M'lntyre's. \u2014 Mining operations have remained during the month without any improvement. The alluvial miners are engaged in the old workings with indifferent success. The amalgamated company on Marshall's Reef have not been able to recover the lost vein. The number and power of the machinery have under gone no change during the month. From a number of returns of the \"yield of quartz on different reefs I select the following:\u2014 In my report for the 14th of April last I gave some particulars of the five companies then in existence. The Argus Flat Company was one of the first and most successful in the colony, worked and managed by an association of miners, the only wages paid being for extra necessary labour. This company has again extended its claim, and evinces no sign of relaxation. The Caledonian Company, which holds the machi nery and plant of the defunct Castlemaine Company, with 5 acres of alluvial ground on Forty-foot and Clinker's Hills, Castlemaine, has again resumed work. The Chewton Sluicing Company has its machinery erected, consisting of a steam-engine, with powerful force-pumps, erected on Angus's ground, for the pur pose of forcing water for sluicing purposes, from the Angus shaft to the top of Poverty Hill\u2014a distance of 1,200 feet. The company has renewed its application for a lease of 5 acres of alluvial ground on Poverty Hill.

Several claims in which auriferous quartz was procured from near the surface have failed to yield such favourable results at greater depths. Five claims are at work on Milkman's Reef, but no payable quartz has been obtained during the month, and should nothing better be discovered soon several will have to register their claims. The Ger man Reef is still yielding payable stone, but nothing very rich has been obtained lately.

I have not heard of any extraordi- nary success during the month, although a number of claims have paid good wages ; but when it is taken into consideration that most of our hill and sluicing claims can only be worked four or five months in the year, it is not surprising that the miners are inclined to complain if the average yield does not amount to 15s. or \u00a31 per day.

Several claims, partly in old ground, have been marked on Boot's Bald Hill, and the tunnels started ; but it will take months before the ground can be tested. The old tunnel claims, on elevated plains, are nearly all being worked, and the holders seem to be well satisfied. In alluvial sinkings I have no rushes to report. A few very good patches have been found in New Nug- getty Gully, Yandoit, lately ; and there is, I believe, a good number of diggers at work. Forty-feet is rather dull at present ; but a prospectingshaftis going down below the old workings, and I have no doubt that the lead will be found, if the prospecting is carried on with energy. A number of miners are prospecting the gullies between Bald Hd, Deep Creek, and Yandoit, and there is every appearance of the ground being auriferous, but the gold in that locality is generally nuggetty, forming a narrow run, or rather string of patches, and thus it often happens that a number of holes are sunk which miss the gold.

This company contemplates mining ope rations on a most extensive scale, which I have reason to believe will be attended with success. At Anderson's Creek, Messrs Clarke and Bourne have resumed operations on Thompson's Bend, Dr. Owens has been for some time working his new patent puddling machine, which is very successful as to its puddling capabilities, and very efficient for sav ing the gold. I have examined some samples of quartz, after its treatment by Mr. Wilkinson's process, and from the state to which the quartz was reduced in that opera tion, I feel bound to say that it is, in my opinion, one of the most efficient, if not the most efficient, method of extracting gold that has yet been in vented. The population at the Emerald Goldfield, by re port, is 160. Mr. Murphy states that the tables are the result of actual counting, but are liable to an error of defect. The number at the Emerald Gold field includes those employed at a discovery north of Briarty's, extending towards the Yarra Gap. There are four quartz machines at work, and two idle ; two puddling machines at work, and eight idle ; giving employment to 30 men. Thirteen machines are driven by horses, five by water, and 23 by steam. 1 I am glad to be able to state that considerable im provement has taken place in ray division. The tables show a great increase in the number of persons employed at quartz mining, showing a great improve ment, when it is considered that this is chiefly a quartz district Although the tables show an increase in the number of miners generally, alluvial mining is, from its very precarious results, falling into disrepute very rapidly. On One-Tree Hill, Messrs. Hamilton and party have again struck a rich patch on the Swedish Reef, the exact yield of which I have not ascertained; but the specimens shown to me a few days ago were exceedingly rich. This claim, with two others on One-Tree, and three claims on the Yow Yow have become the property of a company which has been lately formed, known as the Evelyn Quarcz Mining and Quartz Crushing Company. All the pre liminaries required by the leasing regulations have been gone through by Messrs. Holmes, Randle, and Ricards, in order to obtain a lease of 41 acres of ex ceedingly valuable auriferous ground, on One-Tree Hill. The ground is traversed by quartz reefs, and will, no doubt, yield a splendid remuneration, when capital and raining skill are brought to bear upon it. Messers. Clarke, Watson, and Clarke have also gone through the required preliminaries, in order to obtain a lease of a large tract of auriferous ground on One- About the first week in September a new gold-field was discovered on the left bank of the Yarra, be tween Briarty's and the Yarra Gap, and about 49 miles from Anderson's CreeK. Of this gold-field I have learned by report that the sinking is shallow, and the ground very suitable for sluioe washing ; that the drift is composed almost entirely of white barren looking quartz ; that the gold is exceedingly fine, and that there are about 120 persons there at present. There being now some prospect of a reduction in the price of quartz crushing, audit being the convic tion that quartz mining is the safest investment in this division, prospecting for quartz reefs is being carried on very extensively.

With reference to the leads in this division, I have but little of interest to report. The yield of g old con tinues tolerably good, so far as I have been able to ascertain ; but owing to several of the companies being involved in litigation, it is difficult to obtain accurate information on this head. I have tbe honour to report that since my last, mining operations on the Big* Hill or Lago Hill, at Campbell's Diggings, have been attended with toler able success The opinion which I expressed in a former report, viz., that a lead or gutter would be discovered in that locality, has been considerably strengthened by the operations during the last month. The shafts recently bottomed prove that the auri serous ground lies between two reefs, very closely resembling the reefs found at the beads or shallow ends of the leads or gutters on Ballarat. There are large quartz boulders, very much water-worn, found in the auriferous stratum. The dip is in a northerly direction, in which direction, judging from the features of the locality, the deep ground is likely to be found to run. Water, in moderate quan tities, is also found in the deepest ground, all of which facts confirm me in the belief that it is the of a deep lead ; and, judging from the prospects already obtained, I am in clined to add, a tolerably rich one. The auriferous ground, or lead, at the Big Hill appears to run north 20 degrees west ; and, a3 the Big HU1 is about six miles in a westerly direction from the deepest knywn point of the Golden Point Lead, and from the general bearings of the Frenchman's, Redan, and Golden Point Leads, it is probab-e that the main lead formed by the confluence of these leads will be about north 15 de grees west. I conclude that the lead from the Big Hill will join the Main Lead about six and a half miles from Ballaarat, in the direction of Lake Burrumbeet. The Golden Point Lead is 367 feet deep, at the deepest known point, and up to that point has dipped at the rate of about 63 feet per mile; and, as the point at which I suppose the lead from the Big Hill will join the Main Lead is about six and a half miles from the deepest known poiut of the Golden Point Lead, allow ing for the fall of the surface towards Lake Burrum beet, and making a small allowance for the sinuosities of the lead, I presume the depth at that point will not be less than 650 feet. Taking into consideration the probabilities in fa vour of the supposition that our deep leads pass through an immense tract of country, one is led to the conclusion that deep-sinking is at present only in its infancy, and that, under proper management, it will prove a permanent source of wealth and a remu- Quartz- Reefs.\u2014 The Township Quartz- Reef Company has nearly completed the erection of its crushing ap paratus, which is constructed and erected in a very superior manner, and I hope in my next to be in a position to report favourably, not only of the working of the machinery, but also of the yield of tbe quartz raised from the claim. The Company holding the claim adjoining that of the Township Quartz Reef Company has obtained quartz containing gold, and has made arrangements for having a few tons crushed as a trial. The result I will report in my next. The Havilah Company, near the Milkmaid's Lead, is still driving for, but has not yet discovered, the main reef, though they have cut several leaders containing gold. I have forwarded per coach specimens of the first, second, third, and fourth rocks, sunk through by the Great Redan Extended Company, on the Redan Lead. The enclosed sections will show the various strata sunk through by the Great Redan Extended Company on the Redan Lead, and the Tannery Company on tha Inkermann Lead, up to date.

Ab an example, it may be stated that the advantage has been taken of the natural formation of the locality, in order to prevent the necessity of the tailings from the washing machinery having to be moved. To this end the shaft has been sunk upon rising ground, so that there is a natural fall for the tailings, and the head of the shaft has also been raised, to leave room for placing the rubbish brought up, without labour having to be employed in removing It from the first position into which it may be thrown. Quartz-Mining.\u2014 During the last few weeks a great deal of attention has been given to quartz-mining iu my district, a result of the success achieved byseveral of the companies now at work. Formerly, it was generally supposed that a yield of less than one ounce to the ton would not pay, but it is now ascertained that even less than that quantity will afford highly remunerative employment for the men engaged . The opinion that Ballaarat presented a very unfa vourable field for such operations is fast giving way before the results actually attained ; and it is now proved that if the district cannot show such magnifi cent returns as are obtained in other districts, at least there is a profitable investment for capital. From the present indications I feel justified in say ing that before long I shall have to report a great in crease in the machinery employed, and that a much larger amount of capital will also be invested. Since my last report, 11 new claims on quartz lodes have been taken up. In the neighbourhood of Brown's Hill claims have been taken up on a lode discovered about a fortnight since. This lode is about four feet in breadth, and is a continuation of one that was struck in claim No. 70, in the Caledonian Lead. It may be remarked that this claim was very rich, and the general opinion is that the lode will be found to be remunerative. [Mr. Cowan has furnished a long description of the plans of the workings, machinery, and ventilation of the Caledonian Company's Mine.] bitants being Chinese, it is rather difficult to obtain any information with regard to the average wages. However, I believe, the greater part of .the miners are doing very well. Dead Horse and Adjoining Gullies.\u2014 There are 31 companies now engaged, some of whom are merely earning a livelihood, whilst others have very good prospects ; but the scarcity of water will soon throw a great many out of employment, or cause them to migrate to other gold-fields where water is more plentiful. I regret to state that the quartz workings in this part of my district have not been so prosperous as I could wish. i Black Hill.\u2014 On the Black Hill, quartz-working is still carried on to a great extent ; 21 companies are continually at work, and all parties are earning very good wages. Since crushing machinery was erected in the neighbourhood, tbe claims on the hill have be come very valuable \u2014 to such an extent, indeed, that some of the claim-owners value their claims at \u00a380 per inch along the course of the reefs. The Yorkshire is situated about half a mile eastward of the Black Hill, and is occupied by five companies. The pro specting party on this reef have received from crushed quartz an average of J^oz. per ton, but they have dis covered a new vein within the last week, which they consider will pay upwards of 51b. to the ton. Some very rich specimens have been obtained, and, to judge from those I have seen, I fully agree with the valuation mentioned by the shareholders. Little Bendigo. \u2014 On Little Bendigo the majority are earning good wages, the average not being less than \u00a33 per week. There are very few yet engaged in quartz-mining in this part of my district, the work ings being mostly alluvial. The scarcity of water will soon be felt, aud I expect the result will be similar to that of Dead Horse Gully. The Monte Christo Company in this neighbourhood are proceeding very rapidly aud energetically in the erection of machinery, and the quartz-reefs in the vicinity will soon be thoroughly tested.

Some water-worn quartz boulders appear just beneath the surface, and it is supposed that numerous quartz-reefs exist in the neighbourhood, though aa yet none has been dis covered nearer than three or four miles. [Mr. O'Malley states that the country lying between Whim Holes, Paddy's and Italian Gullies, presents strong indications of being auriferous, and recom mends prospecting. He states that there are several parties at present prospecting, and those have met, as yet, with slurht success, except in the case of Pearson's Reef, on Moonlight Flat.] There are 58 quartz claims, and 279 alluvial claims, including block, surfacing, paddocking, old ground, and leases. I beg to forward you plans and sections of the ma chinery and workings of the Caledonian Company, situated near the junction of tne Scotchman's and One Eye Leads. The company consists of 18 working men, and is divided into 24 shares, six of which have been given to the furnisher ofthe machinery and necessary gear. The ground upon which this claim is situated was first worked towards the close of 1853, and was found to be extremely rich. Since that time the same ground has been worked several times, but owing to the large quantity of water, there is every reason to suppose that a great deal of 60lid ground has been left.

The other party, the Young Eastern, are still boring for the deep ground, the course of which they expect to discover in a few days. By reference to the plan, it will be seen that the main outlet or watercourse from the Little Hard Hills is supplemented by the gullies known as the Highlandman's, Swiper's, aud New Chum, before it reacheB Whim Holes proper, and as these tributaries have been found in many instances to yield handsome returns, it is confidently expected that when all have united in one trunk gully, or gutter \u2014 as at point marked B on plan \u2014 thenceforward the ground will be rich.

Crayfish and Black Leads.\u2014 The only party (the prospecting) on the Crown Lands portion of the Cray fish have not, as yet, reached the gutter, though it appears they might, and would long since have done so, had they been allowed to ascertain the depth of the gutter in the adjoining claim, in the private pro perty of Mr. Winter ; but iu consequence of not being able to demand this information as a matter of right, they sank too deep in the reef before putting in a drive in the direction of the gutter, and thus several weeks of valuable time have been unavailingly ex- I have the honour to forward my report, of subdivision for the month of October, with a plan of grounds oc cupied for mining purposes in the township of Bunin yong, and section t\u00bbf a shaft, showing the character of the Union Jack Lead. The shaft marked No. 1 on plan was sunk by the Grand Junction Company, and struck the gutter at a depth of 148 feet. A drive was put in to the south, along the course of the gutter, but on account oftheyield not beingsufficienttodefraythe necessary expenses, it has been abandoned, and the company are now working in Shaft No. 2, and have driven about 150 feet in a westerly direction, and suc ceeded in breaking into the gutter, from which I am informed a prospect sufficient to warrant them in con tinuing at work was obtained. Up to the commence ment of this month the amount of \u00a36,000 has been expended in carrying on the works. Shaft No. 3 on plan, from which the accompanying section is taken, has been sunk by the Tele graph Company to a depth of 174 feet, and a drive opened out to the east a distance of 25 feet ; the gutter has not yet been found, but it is anticipated it will be in a few days. Shaft No. 4 also has been sunk by the Telegraph Company. At present it is not being worked, as the amount of water was too great to con tend against with manual labour ; but arrangements are now being made for obtaining powerful machinery. The expense of working this company has been to the present time upwards of \u00a35,000. Ata point marked A, a nugget weighiug 231b. was obtained by a party about two and a half years ago, and several of the companies then working between the points marked B and C found payable washdirt ; but, as it deepened, the lead had to be worked by sinKing through rock. The original shareholders therefore left the ground, and until the present companies took possession of it nothing had been done. On the Glencoe Lead several parties were working at the samo time, but it also was abandoned, as the claims granted at that time were not sufficiently large to induce the miners to con tinue at work. pended. The party at work on that portion of the Biack Lead within my division have since my last report got into the gutter at a depth of 290 feet, but hitherto it has* been found very wet. However, great hopes are entertained that the claim will finally pay. The development of Pearson's Reef, Moonlight Flat, has been seriously retarded, by reason of an in junction placed on the prospecting claim. The specimens recently obtained exceed in beauty and richness all preceding ones. W ith the exception of the prospecting claim, in no other has the vein been From the Staffordshire Reef the average yield dur ing the past month has been much better than pre viously. Through the courtesy of Mr. William Ogden Porter I am able to supply the following information respecting stone crushed at the machine : \u2014 Tbe greatest return from any sample of quartz has been J91oz. 14dwt. to 78 tons, and the lowest 2oz. I7dwt. 5grs. to 34 tons. Since commencing work he has obtained the gross yield of 919oz. ldwt. 3grs. from 784 tons of quartz. Several prospecting parties are energetically at work in the ranges contiguous to the Staffordshire, but as yet with no positive results. Mount Misery Creek (2\u00a3 miles south-east from the Staffordshire Reef) is almost exclusively in the pos session of the Chinese. On the Devonshire Lead a lease of five acres was some time since granted to Gainer and others ; and they have lately been getting good returns, and are at present erecting a 12-horse power engine. Nothing of consequence has transpired during the month on the Black Lead, with the exception that tho Scotch and Cornish Company have found washdirt in the gutter to be increasing in depth ; at present it s from 8 to 9 feet in thickness, and averaging from 2\u00a3oz. to 3oz. to 100 cubic feet. On the old workings and shallow sinking the prin cipal occupants of claims now are Chinese, and gene rally speaking, although not obtaining great remune ration for their labour, are still anxiously taking up ground, which but for them would remain unoccu pied. The anticipated junction of the Scotchman's and Durham Leads has not *> et been proven ; and as the Sebastopol Company, in whose claim the junction was expected, is now almost worked out, it will be many months before the adjoining company can furnish any information. Tbe other companies on the Durham Lead are persevering in their endeavours to find the gutter, but as yet no further discovery has been made. No 6, or Buninyong Division. (James W. R.

Their returns are about \u00a35 to \u00a36 per week. 187 puddling-machines, and of these there are 140 at work, and 47 idle. There are 35 whims. The general state of mining in this district, at the close of the past month, has presented a healthier as pect than I have observed at any previous period, and I am happy to be enabled to report that its condition is steaddy improving. At the same time, I have to record a few failures, but they are, when compared with the general progress, too insignificant to be sensi bly felt in a mining community. The Smythesdale Company, at the northern extre mity of the district, have changed the tenure of their claim, from a block claim under tbe local regulations, to a lease of 35 acres 1 rood. Their shaft is about 30 feet deep. Tbe strata passed through consist chiefly of loese sandy drift, through which the waters of an ex tensive flat easdy percolates, and has kept at work an engine of 25-horse power for weeks baling without in termission, and with no sensible diminution of its quantity. The entire depth of this shaft will not exceed 50 feet. The Darlton Castle Company have bottomed, and have found a prospect which has induced them to pro vide an engine. Brennan's Company have sunk three or four shafts. They have at length succeeded in reaching deep ground, and are very hopeful of being recompensed. Between the last-named company and that of Call man and party, on the continuation of the Rox borough Lead, at the Nugget Hill, there have been several claims abandoned, after repeated and fruitless trials. The Campbell's Hill Company have, I understand, the greater portion of their claim worked out. They have been engaged on it for more than two years, and, although for a long time their prospects were very precarious, the winding-up of their accounts will now show an ample remuneration for all their time and outlay. Their ground has been very remarkable for the unequal distribution of gold\u2014 some patches being inordinately rich, whilst in other places not a trace could be found. The North Britain Company (lease) are dividing on an average \u00a330 per man each week. A considerable portion of their ground remains yet unworked. There is a company driving a tunnel in the side of the Black Hill at the level of the wash-dirt, which is about 45 feet below the summit. From the mouth of this tunnel they intend laying a tramway to the creek, which runs at the base of the hill, where an engine will be erected for puddling. The wash-dirt will con sist principally of headings, and refuse of former workings, but with the appliances that will be brought to bear on it, I believe it will turn out a profitable in vestment. I send you a section of the hill. There are a few Chinese at work on Brown's old lead. South of the Contest Lead a quartz reef has been struck during the past month, and six claims, covering a lineal half mile of the range, have been registered. The interval since the discovery being too short to afford a test of its qualities, I must confine myself to the bare notice of the event for the present. The discoverers are getting tolerable quantities of gold out of the rubble between the interstices of the stone. At Spring Dallah, an extensive auriferous region lying between Brown's and Linton's station, there are two parties tunnelling from the level of the creek, which separates the schistoze and basaltic ranges, into the precipitous basalt ridge, which almost perpendicu larly overhangs the northern side of the creek. Their ideas are, that this ridge covers the bod of the ancient river which swept its course through this portion of the district. A party of Italians, impelled by the same notion, penetrated into the edge of this anticipated channel, and found gold ; but, being above tbe drainage level, they were obliged to desist, in consequence of an accumulation of water. The present parties have guarded against any impediment arising in that way, by driving the adit at a level sufficiently low to effect the drainage by gravitation Lower down the stream, near the Old Spring Dalian Lead, there are two or three compauies prospecting. Italian Gully.\u2014 The Waterloo Company have given up their prospecting title, and have applied for a lease ot 33 acres\u2014 the same ground they held as a pros pecting claim. This claim is bounded by the fence of Brown's pre-emptive right, where mining on a very enlarged and improved principle is about to be com menced. The remainder of Campbell's Hill is in the occupa tion of the Chinese ; and judging from the quantity of wash-dirt they are producing, as well as from their eagerness to secure every available spot of ground in the immediate vicinity, there can be little doubt but that they are doing well. It is worthy of remark that a party of Europeans, assisted by steam power, expe rimented on this identical ground two years ago, and abandoned it as worthless. Along the old workings on Smythesdale Flat the Chinese are the only miners workir? g now. They are puddling what has been frequently turned over by others, and from all the information I can collect they are making good wages. Linton's. \u2014 The Standard Lead is the centre of attrac tion, every new shaft bottomed on it exceeding the preceding. Claim No. 17-18, is washing in some machines as high as 48oz. The g.dd in this claim is very nuggetty. They have picked out about 31b. in nuggets. This is the last claim obtaining gold, and being the richest, high hopes are entertained by holders of the succeed ing claims, that the steady and gradual improvement manifest from No. 6 djwn wards will continue uninter rupted. The remaining claims, as far as No. 34, which ter minates the frontage, are all erecting whims, the water being too excessive for the windlass and bucket plit d by mere manual labour. There are various parties out prospecting the vast region that lies to tbe westward of Linton's, towards the plains, the solitude of which bad never before been intruded upon in seareh of gold. That country has always presented a most inviting appearance. The Wet Flat, Candlestick, Bloomer's, and Nug getty Gullies, are being worked by the Chinese. On the Hard Hill there are several Chinese encampments. I believe the Chinese are all making wages. At Lucky Woman's and Happy Valley, block claims, under by-law X., have become the rage during the month. All the partially-worked old gullies and bills, which would likely remain for years unproductive under the old tigime, are now eagerly sought for, and puddling-machines and water supplies are once more here in high request. Several prospecting parties, The Argyle Lead, which is supposed to join the Roxburgh in or near the Lightning Claim, has turned out very satisfactorily. All the companies on it are realising more than ordinary wages. The returns from most of the claims fluctuate between \u00a33 and \u00a311 per man weekly. The El Dorado Company, next the Lightning Com pany, have given up. It is a singular circumstance that they got nothing, though to all appearances ex tremely well situated for the united product of the two leads, which must of necessity find a passage through some part of the claim. Another party have taken the necessary steps to obtain possession of it, with a view of giving it further trial. Frazer's Hill is about to become the scene of scien tific sluicing operations. Messrs. Lock and Hamilton have obtained a grant of the Old Surfacing Hill : they have secured a water-privilege sufficient to give an uninterrupted supply for all purposes connected with the enterprise, and they are about to commence busi ness forthwith. Much interest attaches to this \u2014 the first experiment in sluicing on a proper principle we have had. yet. There are several other hills and ranges of greater reputed richness than Frazer's Hill, which will be eagerly seized upon if the present undertaking proves a remunerative one."], [125, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. 7 encouraged by the liberal areas, are also adventuring where a few months ago no one would think of in curring the expense. The sinking on the principal hill here is about 90 feet, extremely hard, being com posed chiefly of ferruginous cement. It is worthy of remark, that this was the only part of the district where the introduction of large claims was opposed, but when they experienced the advan tage of them then an alteration took place, and there is Bcarcely a place now where they would Beem to be more acceptable. Carngham.\u2014 There are several companies working on the private property on Preston's Hill, who are all reported to have magnificent claims. There are also numerous leases applied for on the Crown lands around the Green Hill, Preston's Hill, and the Rock Lead, of which I have no record, not having been surveyed by myself I cannot furnish you with any particulars nor information concerning them, but one thing I have observed, that they appear to be intended for purposes of speculation, rather than any bonafide intentions to work them earnestly, as the surface has not been yet broken in any of them, though a long interval has elapsed since they were exempted by virtue of leasing regulations from the occupation of the holders of miners' rights, many of whom would be anxious to avail themselves of block claims there. another engine, with winding-gear, to enable them to pursue their works at a greater depth, having too much water to contend with for the windlass. During the moBth they have crushed 511 tons of quartz, which yielded 289oz. 5dwt. 12gr. They are about to apply iron lifters to four of their stampers, which will be fitted on a new principle, to avoid the elaboration of screws and guides as heretofore fixed. If effective, I will forward drawings in my next. They are at pre sent working Robinson's Reef, which at a depth of 108 feet underlies to the east 1 in 12, and in the new shaft, from 116 to 140 feet, it is found underlying to the west at an angle of 1 in 4. The break in the reef alluded to at a depth of 30 feet, which about midway is hove to the eastward, is found to be the same at 108 feet. The Yankee Company have been delayed in crushing owing to a defect in the beds, which are, however, secured by having put in cast-iron boxes, which are tightened at the sides with cordage, redlead, and rust. The yield from 222 tons has been 269oz. They are at present only working the eastern reef, which varies from 30 feet at the cap to 6 feet in width at the lower level. They have some difficulty in taking out the quartz, consequent on the adjacent alluvial workings and the great width of the reef. Timbering has proved of no avail, and they are, therefore, filling up the old workings to secure the mine. They are raising some valuable stone, which is expected to average over 2oz. per ton. A reservoir has been lately built to supply the boiler, which, owing to a difficulty in getting clear water, requires frequently to be blown off. Victoria Quartz-mining Company. \u2014 Their shaft, which is now 10 by 4, is down 240 feet. They have just struck a gold-bearing reef, 3 feet wide, believed to be the eastern. This is the first of remuneration, after being at work the last 20 months, and expending \u00a33,990 in machinery and works. The engine, which is capa ble of working to 45-horse power, and pumping appa ratus, is of a superior kind. They use a flat rope, 5 inches wide, for winding. As one proof of the paying character of the lode, the company will forthwith erect stamping batteries. Alluvial Claims.\u2014 Clunes Co-operative Company (Tributors). No. 1 new shaft to replace the one ren dered useless by the fall of the ground from the sur face, is bottomed at 113 feet, from which it is intended to work the alluvial, and the Welcome Reef, which is about 80 feet from the surface. At present they are working from the No. 2 shalt, principally towards the continuation of the run of gold. The ground is not paj ing so well as heretofore, yielding on the average, taking old and new ground together, about lloz. to the machine. It is proper to state that \" a machine\" is very indefinite, as the wash dirt being very clayey, much is puddled away. Sta tistics of quantities will be given in my next. The company have paid off the sleeping half shares. There are now 30 members, who pay 50s. weekly to the funds, and all the work is done by contract, share holders having a preference of performing the work at or below the manager's valuation. They have a large amount of ground yet unworked. The gold from this ground is remarkably fine, so much so, that the manager has expressed an opinion that nearly one-third is lost in the process of puddling, by being washed away with the sludge. This he is prepared to remedy, as soon as a more abundant sup ply of water can be obtained, by the use of more com plete sluicing and amalgamating appliances. The importance of an abundant supply of water for this district is considerable, seeing that both the quartz and alluvial workings are comparatively poor. It is only large operations that are of a paying character. The company has lately taken possession of some of the drives of the outsiders, who have erstwhile held a claim on non-auriferous ground, and supported them- [Mr. Lynch has given a full description of the operations of the various companies in his division.} Creswick Division. (James StevenBon, Mining Surveyor.) I have the honour to forward my report of the Chines portion of my district. Since my last, three alluvial companies on the Northern Hill, and four on the Southern Hill, have ceased to work, and a consi derable diminution in the population is perceptible from the number of houses for sale. The number of miners engaged is 590. Clunes Co-operative Quartz-mining Company.\u2014 This Company have obtained a renewal, for six months, of their agreement with the Port Phillip Company to crush on halves, with a certain rebate per ton. The result of the same will be shown below. Port Phillip Company.\u2014 In my last I reported the quantities and yields of quartz from July 1857 to July 1869 inclusive, viz., 30,207 tons yielded 39,069oz. 14dwt., average loz. 5dwt. 21gr. ; July 28 to October 20, 1859, 9,980 tons yielded* 4,006oz. 18dwt., value \u00a315,670 4s. Id. During the past month, one of the Company's mana gers has been further testing different amalgamating appliances, with a view of saving the labour attendant on the use of blankets, which are found indispensable to a certain extent. Adjacent to the No. 1 battery has been fitted a double wooden trough, each tier of which is charged with 1401b. of quicksilver, with which the crushed matter, as it is discharged from the battery, is brought into direct contact. A portion of the tables was removed to allow of the application of copper plates, coated with silver, to four shoots, which con ducted the debris to the blankets, at the foot of which the tailings w ere again brought into eontact with the mercury passing through a similar trough as applied at the top of the strikes. The results have proved very satisfactory, as regards the amalgamating troughs close to the battery, which retain the bulk of the gold. The metalled shootB are now removed, not having had sufficient fall to clear themselves, and the strikes shortened by 6 feet, are brought up to the troughs above. The amalgamating trough at the foot of the strikes is still retained, as it has proved to be useful whilst washing down, and to lose no quicksilver. The proportion of gold retained by the lower tiers of blankets during a period of four weeks is 5gr. per ton. Except on the occasion named, the use of the lower amalgamating trough is almost nil. The Criterion Quartz-Mining Company have ob tained an extension of ground to the west Their new shaft is down 140 feet. They are about fitting up * The average yield per ton of 16dwt. 2grs. is ac counted for by the quartz not being picked as here tofore."], [126, "8 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. Is but little worked. The only feature peculiar to it is that, unlike the other reefs in the district, it has, on the eastern side, a soft, fine pipeclay, which re- quires careful timbering to secure while being driven through. On the western side there is a hard grit sandstone, with several leaders formed through It, running in all directions, as shown in the western drive on the transverse sections of the reef, varying in thickness from three inches to two feet. The reefs, generally, are divided by a elay seam running north and south, and, in all cases, the eastern side of the reef is the only portion which has paid for working. The western side, as also the small leaders, contain gold, but in too small quantities to pay for working and expensive crushing. Parker's Reef. \u2014 The northern end of this reef, from the centre of Prospect claim to No. 6 north, is now in possession of a Company who have taken it under lease. They have bought Messrs. Brown and Harper's crushing machine, which they are about to remove from its present site to their own ground. They have also commenced operations on the reef, and are getting out quartz. The last quantity of quartz taken from this ground (No. 3 north) yielded b'2oz. 8dwt. from 15 tons of quartz, being an average of 4oz. 3dwt. 4gr. per ton. This was obtained at a depth of 190 feet. From No. 6 south, the reef is also under leasehold, so that there are but four shafts, or parties, now at work on the reef, under miners' right tenure. Mount Hope Company have received some of their plant, now on the ground, and are busy letting con- tracts of the different works\u2014 viz., construction of dams, tramways, getting timber on the ground, &c. Kangaroo Reef. \u2014 Since this reef came under the leasing protection very little time has been lost. They have already purchased an engine, near their ground and in good working order, from Messrs. Walsh Bro- thers, aijd have let several contracts for works to be immediately carried out. They have also applied for an extended area, which will include the reefs known as Littleboy's and Walshman's. The Outward Bound, Homeward Bound, and Trench's Reefs, and the southern portion ot the Lone Star Reef are all in possession under lease, and com- panies are about being formed to work them. Some prospecting parties are at present out looking for alluvial or quartz mines, and, from the extensive indi cations of both in the district (if they have sufficient perseverance), I doubt not they will be rewarded. Some have already been partially successful, but there is not time yet to test fully the value of the reef they came upon ; they have found, however, some very good specimens. Mount Egerton.\u2014 In this portion of the district there is scarcely any visible change. All seems to go on in a quiet, regular manner. There are five claims at work on the Large Quartz Hill, working at depths from 80 to 120 feet. The main reef is from 22 to 32 feet in thickness, with several leaders east and west from 6 inches to 2 feet thick, all containing gold. On the Little Hill one party is still working, and have had some quartz taken out and crushed, but the yield did not exceed a \u00a3oz. All Nations Gully (Alluvial).\u2014 There are still se- veral companies at work, and last week a new piece of ground was opened, and a small rush created, which will probably turn out well, as they have found gold in paying quantities. The population on Egerton and Gordon would be considered settled for the past three months, but I think it will now be on the increase, as the companies commence operations. [Mr. Cusack has furnished sections illustrative of the workings in his division.] selves by inroads upon the private property. The said parties have since abandoned \" their claims.\" The result of the company's operations irom Septem- ber 8, 1858, to September 10, 1859, was6,936oz. ; from September 10 to October 22, 536oz. lSdwt. 22gr.

The majority of the party intend to sink another shaft. Their late yields have varied from 9oz. to 33oz., per machine. North Clunes Eureka Company have been working till lately. They have sunk through haid rock to a depth of 102 feet. The contractors have given up, the water proving heavier than 20 gallon buckets worked by a whim, night and day, could lift. The Young Sons of Freedom, after Beven months* work, have some expectation of being handsomely re- munerated. They have struck a run of deeper ground, which, as far as proved, is over 60 feet in width, at present the party (10 men) are getting from \u00a38 to \u00a310 per man weekly, with prospects of a long job before them, as, with the extension of an aban- doned claim, they have now 800 feet along the sup- posed lead by 600 feet. They have laid down a tram- way underground, and convey the wash-dirt to the shaft in trucks, and after it has been raised by a whim it has to be carted to their machine. As miners' gardens intervene between their shaft and the creek, they cannot lay down a surface tramway. John Bull Company. \u2014 The dividends per man average about \u00a34 weekly. There is nothing special to report in any of the workings. On the Red Streak, Creswick, the Ten- Acre Com pany have, after eight months' work, bottomed at a depth of 147 feet. The prospect from the bottom gives a dwt. to the tub. Owing to the quantity of water, they have not yet opened out, consequently no gutter is yet proved. Several parties on this hill are making good average wages, varying from \u00a34 to \u00a38 per week per man. The prospecting party at the Bald Hill diggings have, at a depth of 105 feet, got a gutter ; it is 6 feet wide, with 2 feet of wash-dirt, which has, so far as yet tried, averaged lOoz. to the machine. The Black Lead is taken up by Chinese, who are now on it in great numbers. There are no means of obtaining accurate information from them, but from the energy with which they are working, and many other indications, it is certain that they must be ob taining a good deal of gold from it, although most of it is now being worked for the third time.

Of these, 11 are moved by water, 4 by Bteam, and 2 by horses.] I have nothing of note to communicate. The reefs are looking well, but the want of capital greatly re tards the operations of several companies here. On Simmon's Reef the Crown Company have raised, and are still raising, some very good stone. The Simmon's Reef Quartz-Mining Company have also good stone, and are satisfied. Messrs. Martin and Smith are erecting a machine for the Lerderderg Company, and from their well-known energy it is anticipated that the machine will be in full working order in {[about three months. On Trewhella's Reef mining operations are at a standstill, chiefly on account of the abundance of water ; but as machinery is in course cf erection to overcome this difficulty, I hope to be able to report more favourably in my next report. The stone raised from Trewhella's Reef has yielded a first-class average ; and I anticipate good returns as soon as the different companies are enabled to work. The Early Bird Company, on Johnson's Reef, have had 20 tons of stone crushed, which yielded lloz., and, as the reef is a great width, \u2014 in one place eight feet \u2014 this yield may be considered payable. From the other reefs I have nothing worth report ing.

There has also been a rush at the Lower Three mile, at Bowman's Forest ; but they have not as yet been successful. The original prospecting party ha-ve given up and left, and the company are forming an other party to test the ground more thoroughly. The White Horse Company some 200 yards below the pro specting shaft have sunk a shaft, and come upon the bed-rock at 60 feet. That has been given up, and an other company formed, who are sinking a prospecting shaft about 300 yards south of claim 5 of the Ballaarat Lead. The El Dorado is exciting considerable attention. It is a continuation of Reid's Creek, some 10 miles below the Lower Falls, and is the lowest point to which the diggings have extended. It is in the bed of the creek, a low flat of 100 yards in width. There have been several trials to get to the bottom, but as it is from CO to 100 feet in depth, and formed of decom posed granite, the water could not be kept down. Vinebone and Co. were the first to work it success fully. The company is composed of 18 miners. It will take them five years to work their claim out. The company, after deducting wages and expenses, clear at the rate of \u00a316,000 per annum, and if more economy were used, \u00a320,000 might be netted. There are three other companies below that com mencing operations\u2014 O'Neill and Co., who have a 14-horse power engine on the ground, but which has not yet been erected; Kenyon and Co., who have a beautiful engine just erected, and ready to start, of 20 horse power; and Wellington and Co., who have an engine of nearly 4-horse power on the ground, but are getting a more powerful one from England. The plan which I have the honour to Bend Is of Reid's Creek, and part of Spring Creek. The creek is called Spring Creek above the Upper Falls, and Wool shed Creek below the Lower Falls. It was opened up in November, 1851, when it was worked in paddocks, and as the alluvium is almost entirely composed of de composed granite, slabs and bark were required to prevent the sides from falling in. Patches of it were immensely rich, intermixed with great quantities of black sand, or tin ore. It has been again worked over in sluice-boxes; and now, for the third time, it is being gone over with improved sluicing means. Tail races which can clear themselves are of great value. That marked A on the plan is costing \u00a3500, a good deal of blasting being required, and bows 14 by 9, and 2-inch boards, being inserted for a length of 500 yards. That marked B is between 400 and 500 yards long, and has an average breadth and depth of 5 yards, partly through soft granite. It has just been completed, at a cost of \u00a3700. BEECHWORTH MINING DISTRICT. Spring Creek Division. (Henry Grimes, Mining Surveyor.) The estimated population is as follows At Beechworth the population is estimated at 3,000, making a total for the division of 9,814. There are 11 puddling-machines\u2014 namely, 6 at the Three-mile (2 of which are idle), 1 at the Two-mile, and 4 at Pennyweight Flat. They are nearly all in the pos session of Chinese. There are 10 steam-engines, of the aggregate of 96 horsepower. The population is settled, and generally, I believe, doing well. We had an unexpected supply of rain during the week, which is keeping up the supply in the various races for the present. As our earth is not ef the richest, it is by quantity that the deficiency is to be made up, and to do this large supplies of water are required. The gold mining of this district is wholly alluvial. There are several quartz-reefs, but only one has been tried. It is situated on the Red Hill, adjoining Spring Creek. The prospects they have had are not encouraging, although it is not at all unlikely that by sinking deeper the main lead, with a considerable breadth of quartz, might be struck, rich enough to pay for a considerable outlay. Upon the other side of Spring Creek, bank claims have been taken up on Roper's Hill, which are ex pected to pay well to those who can obtain a suffi ciency of water for sluicing. South of this, at the head of Silver Creek, in Mopoke Gully, an old lead that had been considered to have been worked out, has been again struck at the upper end, and continued by several parties\u2014 the sinking becoming deeper the Snake Valley and Yackandandah Divisions.

There are six puddling mills at work. During the past month there has been a slight exodus of the population to Morses Creek, in the Buckland Division, but taking the arrivals into con sideration, no change in the numbers worthy of note has occurred. With respect to machinery, two new puddling mills have been started, and one that was idle has resumed work. Messrs. Dillon and party have nearly completed their tail-race (see plan of Europa Gully), and have commenced Washing oua most extensive scale, the banks being undermined to the bed rock and brought down, and the dirt washed away by means of a large btream of water being brought to bear on it.

There are 54 puddling machines at work and seven idle ; 16 whims, 70 whips, and seven engines at work, of the aggregate of 69-horse power. Three others are in course of erection. During the past month no mining event of any im portance upon the old Indigo Lead calls for special notice. The late fall of rain, which proved bo ac ceptable in other portions of the district, scarcely ex tended to the main lead at all, and parties are still engaged working out their claims and accumulating large piles of wash-dirt. The prospecting party at the junction of the main and Caledonian leads have been obliged to suspend operations, owing to the impossibility of mastering the water without the aid of machinery. Their shaft was 250 feet deep. They intend to place an engine on the ground, and expect to be in a position to resume work in the course of a month.

The middle part is being worked, and is turn ing outvery well. The lowerparthasnotyetbeen proved. The Durham Lead. \u2014 So far as the claims on this lead have been bottomed, they have proved highly satisfactory. The gold obtained is very coarse. The Scotchman's Lead.\u2014 Some shafts above the pro spectors' claim on this lead have been bottomed, but no gold was obtained, and the claims have been now abandoned. Below the prospectors' several shafts have been sunk, but none bottomed on the course of the lead. The prospectors' claim is not turning out so well as was anticipated. Chiltern Lead. \u2014 Upon this lead the Township and Oriental claims have been bottomed since my last re port, and gold in small quantities has been obtained in both claims, but they have not yet fairly struck the lead in either. The Alliance and Nil Desperandum claimB are both 3aelding well. The New Ballarat Lead.\u2014 This lead frcm the Nil Desperandum is not yet defined. Beyond the saddle and,up to the stockyard very few miners are employed, els the ground is almost worked out. The Suflolk Lead.\u2014 All the upper part of this lead has been abandoned. The middle portion is very nearly worked out. The lower part is still yielding very well. This lead has been about the richest in the district. Skeleton Lead. \u2014 \"Very few are at work on this lead, and there is nothing of any importance to report. The faU of rain at the latter end of the month en abled the miners on these leads to wash up. The dirt in most instances has averaged very well. I beg to remark that all these leads are very short, and are all of them surrounded by quartz-reefs, which only re quire to be tested by experienced miners, assisted by capital, to bring them into favourable notice. To judge from the surface caps, from which only, in most instances, quartz has been crushed, these reefe must be highly auriferous. The Devonshire Lead.\u2014 A new lead under the above title has just been opened. It is situated S.W.of Staine'B Quartz-Reef. The depth of sinking is 200 feet. The depth of wash-dirt is about two feet, and the prospects obtained from three dishes was about half an ounce. A quartz reef was also discovered at the bottom of the prospect shaft, which is supposed to he a continuation of Stame's Reef. Quartz-Mining \u2014Very little has been done during the past month in quartz-mining. Neither of the machines have been kept nearly employed. Gitchell and Chalmers have only crushed 175 tons, which ave raged 2\u00a3oz. of gold per ton. Abbott's machine has crushed a much smaller quantity, and the average yield has been lesB. The numbers of the population are taken from the police returns. This being such an extensive division, comprising so great an area of country, I can only offer a few pre- liminary observations this month. I am preparing a general plan of the district, and will endeavour to for- ward it, or a portion of it, with my next report. The Yackandandah Creek is a continuation of the Nine MUe, and receives its name, Yackandandah, after the junction with Clear Creek\u2014 the portion between the junction and Rocky Point, which is the boundary of the Nine Mile, being called Muddy Creek. At Rocky Point a small creek, called the Wombat Creek, joins the main creek. The formation of this district differs from the Nine-mile. Through nearly the entire length of the ereek, to its junction with the Little River, the bed-rock is granite ; whereas in the Nine-mile, there are strata of sandstone and slate. Immense granite boulders also appear on the opposite banks. The population is pretty equally distributed through- out the whole length of the creek, as far as the work- inga extend, viz., to about five miles from the junction with the Little River. They appear to be a very settled and prosperous community. The Yackandandah may be divided into three di- visions : \u2014 1st. Upper Yackandandah, starting from RockyPoint, including Wombat Creek, Clear Creek, Kirby's Flat, Bell's Flat, and Twist's Flat. 2nd. Township, including the neighbouring surface hills, Whiskey Flat, and Apostle's Flat. 3rd. Lower Yackandandah, including Rowdy Flat, Osborn's Flat, and Staghorn Flat. The Little River and Sandy Creek (the latter about 30 miles from the township) are also included in this mining division, as well as the Indigo Creek, to its function with the Murray. The principal method of mining carried on is sluicing, every available creek and swamp being forced to yield their treasures of water for the hill sluices. A party of miners, under the name of the Pioneer Water Company, have cut a race of enormous length, to bring in a supply of water. In the creek, some extensive works, in the shape of deep and lengthy tail races, tunnelling for the same, &c, are in course of operation. The workings on the lower end\u2014 namely, at Allan's district. Flat \u2014 resemble those on the Woolshed, in the Spring Creek Division. The stripping is very heavy, over 30 feet, and the non-auriferous earth is removed in carts\u2014 a method of working only applicable to rich ground. Of machinery there is none in use but water- wheels, and of these there is one in nearly every creek claim. There are prospecting parties out at present seeking alluvial diggings between the Middle Creek and the Indigo, and we may expect the whole of that side of the country to turn out one vast gold-field. There are also some parties prospecting for quartz reefs, but as yet no quartz claims are being worked.

There is little prospecting going on in quartz-mining \u2014probably less than there has been for some time past. Many months since there were large numbers of sleep- ing partners, who were paying into claims which were being prospected by working miners. The want of success which, as was to have been expected, attended many of these ventures has damped the ardour of the greater number of those who entered into them, and the institution ot public companies, by opening an- other channel of investment, has prevented a reaction. There is no increase in the number of puddling-ma- chines ; it is true that one here and there has been erected since my last report, but they are very few and quite counter-balanced by those which, on account of the poorness of the ground or other causes, have been abandoned. There is no perceptible fluctuation in the population. The number of diggers adhering to the old system of the tub and cradle is scarcely appreciable. Puddling-machines are in full work ; the recent rain was much required, but though a con- siderable quantity fell, it was by no means adequate to the requirements of the puddlers. A large number of persons connected with mining pursuits lately attended an exhibition of the galvanic cradle, invented by Conrad Meyerhoff, and patented by Messrs. Cohn Brothers. An opinion favourable to it was generally expressed by those practically acquainted with the subject. As a considerable number have been ordered the merits of the invention will be fully tested. The plan which I send will show that the depressions con- taining the mercury are of a novel shape. With the roughest motion of the cradle there is no splashing of the mercury, which, on the contrary, is thrown up on the plate like a wave, exposing a large amalgamating surface. The patentees exhibit samples of gold saved by this cradle ; they are as fine as the finest flour. An inexperienced eye would scarcely recognise it by the colour as gold. The compression of a small quan- tity of the powder however on paper, with the point of a pen-knife, developes the metallic lustre. There are no changes of the slightest importance on the Upper Bendigo Flat. Some time since steps were taken for purchasing out the puddlers on this ground, with the object of subsequently obtaining a lease for the same, but in consequence of the large sums de- manded by many of the puddlers t-he scheme was abandoned. Four parties are now working the Monument-hill Reef, New Chum. This reef was worked many years since, and close to the surface a spur containing gold was struck. Subsequently a reef (the Eastern) was found ; but the difficulty of overcoming the water, and the very moderate yield of gold, caused the aban- donment of the ground. The miners at present at work are down, in one instance, 140 feet, and are driving for the Western Reef. They have to lift about five gallons of water per hour, which quantity, how- ever, will probably be increased when the reef is tapped. Teakettle Gully affords no encouragement to puddlers. The one machine on it is supplied with dirt from a distance. The ground appears to have been little interfered with since first opened. Some three diggers are working at its lower extremity. Maori Gully presents a similar appearance to that just mentioned. Only one machine remains at work ; another has been apparently abandoned. A good deal of the ground appears not to have been dis turbed for some time. In New-Chum Gully puddling is progressing vigor ously. At the head of the gully, the North New- There are four powerful steam-engines in course of erection. There is very little alteration in my division since my last report. Since the last heavy rains alluvial workings generally have been carried on more briskly, in consequence of the good supply of water. There has also been a number of new rushes to the various outlying districts to quartz-reefing, in conse quence of parties of prospectors who are spread over the ranges having discovered gold in more or less quantities. The district most distinguished for these is Break-o'-Day and its neighbourhood. [Mr. Harper alludes to the probable development of a rich quartz mining district west of Lockwood, and east of Bendigo \u2014on the Sheepwash, the Emu, and Axe Creeks.] On the Axe Creek, about 16 miles from Sandhurst, a quartz reef with gold visible in the stone has been discovered on the surface, and now there are at least 100 claims taken up, one-half of which are in active operation. About 12 of them have struck the reef, and are getting stone more or less rich, averaging about 3] oz. to the ton. Glasgow Reef. \u2014 This line is not being actively worked at present, in consequence of the majority of the shafts on the lead having been sunk down to the water level. They are awaiting the erection of some powerful machinery for draining purposes, which is now being put up. Hibernian Reef. \u2014 This line is a few hundred yards to the westward of the Glasgow Reef, and parallel to it. It runs directly through Reserve No. 1, Bendigo Water Works, and continues thence in a line with Phillips's Reef, New Chum. The Water Works Com pany have struck the lead within their grant, and have taken from thence some very rich specimens, which have induced them to work the lode, for which pur pose they are erecting a small engine, to drain the whole line. Sarnia Reef. \u2014 Since my last report a body of quartz has been taken up and crushed, realising an average of 18oz. to the ton. One ton of quartz, which was crushed separately, gave 92oz. Little is being done on the lead at present, the company not having yet com menced working. Thistle Reef.\u2014 On this reef a very rich epur has been discovered within 15 feet of the surface, 2 feet in thickness, and lying almost perpendicular. The last crushing gave about 16oz. to the ton. The claims are all taken up to the northward and southward on the line. Bird's Reef. \u2014 The northerly shafts are actively working, with the usual results. The company which have leased the south end are getting up two powerful engines, for pumping and crushing.

Specimen Hill Reef, Tin-Pot.\u2014 This well-known line, with the exception of two or three claims, lies for the present dormant, the company not yet having got up their machinery. They are, however, making and erecting extensive dams, and clearing the site, &c., for the reception of their engines, which are ex pected shortly. They have broken into a body of quartz, giving almost any quantity, a few tons of which being crushed yielded 4Joz. to the ton."], [130, "12 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. Machinery.\u2014 There are 19 quartz-crushing machine*, and 198 puddling mills. Very tew additions have been made to the list of puddling machines during the last month, and perhapi if the number of mills that have ceased to work were known, the total number of working machines would be about the same. The only fact worth recording is that four new crushing machines are about to bo erected in the vi cinity of isolated reefs, for the purpose of crushing the quartz extracted from them, which not being sufficiently rich to pay for carting to a. distance, may be made remunerative by being crushed on the spot. Some small portion of the machinery required by the mining companies lately formed has arrived' n this district, but none of it has been brought into working order. I have subjoined a tabular statement of the mining population, which differs in a slight degree from that of last month. This has been corrected from informa tion collected expressly for me. The number of miners now employed on the reefs is small, both in consequence of the transition state in which many of the owners of quartz-claims are placed by the transfer of their pri '-ate interest to public com panies, in which the majority of them have still a large stake, and also in consequence of a surplus of water in the underground workings \u2014 an impediment that few private individuals, except those who have been fortunate enough to strike gold in payable quantity prior to coming on the water, are able to overcome. This impediment is a great bar to private enterprise, and I have known nu merous instances where men, after having spent weeks of labour and a considerable amount of capital in sinkmg, have, when in expectation of shortly reap ing the benefit of their labour, found themselves grievously disappointed and their hopes annihilated by the sudden influx of water to their works. In some few cases the miners have by the introduction of horse- whima and by constant baling, been enabled to keep their shafts and drives tolerably dry, and thus to proceed with the work, but in general these means have failed, and the owners have been forced to aban don their claims solely because they have not had the means individually to put up pumping apparatus worked by steam power, even though an engine of very inferior power would have kept them free from inundation. Chum Company are constructing their dam, which promises to be of considerable capacity, and the water-shed affords good drainage. Pbillips's Reef intersects the upper portion of New-Chum Gully. Two shafts are down, respectively 110 and 130 feet, and have taken stone from the reef, which yielded from 17dwt. to loz. to the ton. Ihe work is now in terrupted by the water, which is coming in at the rate of 50 gallons an hour. The first reef was struck at a depth of 50 feet, and it is the second which has since been sunk for. A claim is now going down for the first reef, which is expected to be struck at about 60 feet. The North New-Chum Company, I understand, intend putting an engine on the reef, thus draining it, obtaining cheap crushing, and a supply of water for their puddling operations. The Black and White Leads, New-Chum Reef, are almost at a stand-still, only one or two claims being in work. The great quantity of water to be raised makes it absolutely necessary that a powerful engine should be erected for drainage purposes. There is an immense body of stone, some of which has yielded handsome returns. There is nothing in the alluvial workings of Ironbark and Long Gullies to call for special notice. The Eliza beth Reef, between Ironbark and Long Gullies, has been rushed, in consequence of a spur having been struck containing payable gold. A large number of claims have been marked off, and several shafts are going down. A lease has recently been taken out for a portion of this hill. The Long Gully Reef. There is reason to believe that it will now be vigorously worked by the Long Gully and Black Creek Mining Companies. They intend erect ing a powerful engine for crushing and draining, the boilers for which are now on the ground. This reef was long worked by parties of miners, who paid an assessment for its drainage. Some fine stone was lifted, but the reef was very expensive to work. The first proprietors showed great perseverance, but a flood of sludge and water coming down the gully swamped many of the shafts intersecting it, and rendered it impossible at that time further to work many of the claims. On the Welsh Reef, Derwent Gully, two claims struck payable gold last week, and many of the other claims are, therefore, now being worked vigorously. Clay Reef, in the same gully as the above, is being perseveringly worked. There are several reefs in Der went Gully which have yet to be prospected. Wilson's Reef, Sparrow Hawk Gully, has lately been enlivened by the striking of rich stone in one of the claims. The stone is remarkably hard in immediate proximity to the gold\u2014 in that which was shown me were imperfectly formed crystals. The greatest depth yet attained in this reef is about 140 feet. In Sparrow Hawk and Derwent Gullies alluvial mining proceeds much as usual. The Victoria Reef, Happy Valley, is being energetically worked by all the claimholders. The pumping-engine of Mr. M'Dougal works admirably. It is constantly engaged crushing, as are all the other engines on the line. The spurs in some of the claims near the surface are now being sent to the crushing mills. Messrs. Luffsman and Sterry have lately raised from their claim and crushed at their mill stone which yielded them in one week 676oz., in another 331oz. On the Paddy'B Gully Reef everything is just now at a dead-lock There is not a man at work either in the claims or at the two crushing-mi 11s. This has been caused by the arrangement by the proprietors to sell to a company ; but there appears to be some difficulty in carrying it out. Respecting the population of the reefs, I beg to re mark that, in courFe of travelling through the bush, far away from any habitation, I have had many oppor tunities of remarking that there are more reefs opened in this district than would be anticipated. Upon each of these nameless reefs, perhaps, three or four men may be at work, and I think I shall be within the bounds of the truth when I reckon these isolated workings, on which between oue and three shafts have been sunk, at about 20. Supposing three men to be employed at each of them, about sixty miners would thus be added to the more correctly ascertained number of persons engaged in quartz-mining. Elysian Flat Division.

[From the tables supplied by Mr. Hill, it appears that there are two horse-puddling machines at work and two idle, and there are engines of the aggregate of 142-horse power engaged in quartz-crushing ] On Reedy Creek mining operations are still much retarded by the want of crushing machinery, as well as by a scarcity of water, already beginning to be felt at this early season, although the late rains have afforded a temporary supply. The former of these wants is likely soon to be obviated. The crushing machinery of Perkins and Company, of the Langendge Reef, is completed, an* would have been already at work but for the necessity of some trifling alterations. Nickinson aDd Company's machinery at Blackman'a will also be at work in a few days. Ruck and Com- pany are also erecting crushing machinery at the Shepherd's Hut, about a mile above the Reedy Creek ownship ; and Mr. Sloan's plant at the Strath Creek will, I am informed, shortly be ready for crushing operations. Alluvial mining seems to attract but little attention in this distric:, and is confined to the immediate vicinity of the creek. There are still some parties sluicing, but the most of them are stopped by a want of water, although I believe that large quantities of un- worked ground exist which would pay fair wages with a good supply of water. Several new lines of quartz have been discovered in various localities of this part of the Sandhurst mining district, namely, at King Parrot Creek, Muddy Creek (Yea), at the Junction, and at Tea-Tree Creek. Numbers of these claims in those localities show exceedingly good prospects ; but as no quartz- crushing machinery is at present at work in these places it would not be desirable to offer an opinion as to the probable yield of the quartz raised. On the King Parrot Creek several reefs are opened, and have been at work for some time past, from which a considerable quantity of stone has been raised ; hut several claims are registered, owing to the want of funds to carry them on. From the pre- sence of water, at an average depth of 60 feet from the surface, great difficulties will have to be over- come, rendering necessary the expenditure of ca- pital. The starting of the crushing machinery of Messrs. Fortune aud Johnson, now in course of erection, and almost completed, will greatly tend to the more active working of these reefs. Preparations are also being made by Mr. S. C. Johnson for the erection of a quartz-crushing machine of 40-horse power, to be worked by water. The reefs at work on the Muddy Creek are situate about one mile north-westerly from the township of Yea. Chinese 110 There are at M'lvOr 134 puddling-machines at work and 45 idle. There are three steam puddling-machines at work, of the aggregate of 18-horse power ; and there are two quartz-crushing machines at work, of the aggregate of 18-horse power. At Wild Duck there are three puddling-machines at work and five idle. And at M'lvor there is one puddling-machine at work and one idle ; and there is one steam quartz-crushing machine, 8-horse power, at work. The yield of gold for the month was 2,261oz. Until the late fall of rain many of the puddling machines, from an insufficiency of water, were either altogether idle or were only temporarily employed, so that in reality the amount of work done would scarcely equal that of half the number of machines With a permanent supply of water. The average yield of gold is about |dwt. to the load, some gullies giving more than ldwt., and the majority little more than Adwt. About three weeks ago there was a rush to a portion of the M'lvor Creek, owing partly to the finding of some nuggets at the head of the creek, and partly to its being anticipated that the place where they were found is a continuation of the most valuable lead on this gold-field\u2014 the pursuit of which has been aban doned for the last four years. In consequence of the sludge from the various machines in the surrounding gullies running into that portion of the creek, the miners were much impeded in their operations until the formation of a new sludge-channel. This day (November 9), I learn that a nugget, 41b. 8oz., has been picked up there ; and that in one of the adjacent gullies\u2014 the Caledonian\u2014 a nugget of 68oz. has been found. During the month, there has been a rush to the Wild Duck Creek. About 100 persons were there, most of whom were dissatisfied with the results. Only three or four claims were remunerative. I understand that a reaction has set in, and that that portion of the creek is abandoned. A considerable amount of sluicing is being carried on along the rivers Campaspe and Coliban ; but the remuneration is by no means equal to that anticipated. This might have been expected from the system of working, as well as from their isolated position (many miles away from a market town), necessitating a con siderable expense for the procuring of provisions, &c. But if co-operative companies were established, or if capital were employed, and suitable machinery intro duced, with a proper system of working, there are many places along both rivers which would yield a re turn of gold highly remunerative. There is scarcely anything being done in the way of reefing in this district, although the general configu ration of many parts present auriferous indications. In the immediate vicinity of Heathcote there arc only M'lvor Wild Duck Coliban and Cam- paspe . .

The aame party got two tons crushed out of the same claim, and the result was 4oz. 5dwt. per ton. There are now 40 claims in actual occupation. Up to this date, gold has been discovered in the quartz in this reef in 28 claims. Finche's Reef. \u2014 This reef, some 18 months back, proved itself one of the most remunerative In the division. The recent crushings, however, though not behind the usual standard of neighbouring reefs, have not turned out too productive \u2014 60 tons realising only 9tioz. In the meantime, the miners of Finche's, having much confidence in its resources, have com bined with some capitalists, and have arranged matters so far, that a lease of 25 acres of this reef is applied for, which, when secured, from the favourable cha racter of the reef, will be a Bure Btepping-stone to the establishment of another mining company. From the rich appearance of the quartz specimens from that locality which I have seen, I am led to think that payable gold will, ere long, be found there ; in fact, I am iniormed that it has already been found. The place is attracting much attention from the miners of this district, and application has been made to the Warden for a site on which to erect crushing ma chinery. \u201e . _ At the junction o!the three stations, namely, Fer guson's, Snodgrass's, and Miller's, situate about eight miles southerly from Yea, several reefs have been dis covered, and gold was obtained there some time since ; but as at the period of my last visit Messrs. William son and Brantine's quartz crushing machine was not erected, I am unable to give the returns. At the Tea-Tree Creek, about two miles from tho junction, reefs have recently been discovered, which are likely to turn out well, offering sufficient induce ment for the erection of a quartz- crushing machine, a site for which has been applied for to the Warden. Avoca Division. MARYBOROUGH MINING DISTRICT. (R. English, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Maryborough Division. (D. O'Leary, Mining Surveyor.) Europeans 4,000 The approximate mining population is as follows :\u2014 Maryborough. Alluvial miners 750 Quartz miners 250 Quartz crushers . 20 Amherst. Alluvial miners 7,400 Quartz miners 140 Quartz crushers 60 Total 8.620 Chinese 1,520 5,520 fMr. English states that these tables comprise only those actually engaged in mining. The total popula tion of the district he estimates at 7,000. Of the mining population there are 340 quartz-miners, 4,470 alluvial miners, 630 puddlers, and 20 engaged in sluicing.] The new reef (Shaw's) lately opened at St. Arnaud is steadily progressing. 10 claims are at work, and the prospectors have crushed 2tons 6cwt. of quarts from the surface, which yielded 4oz. 12dwt. of gold. The thickness of the vein is 18 inches, and is sunk to a depth of 8 feet. At the new reef (Hamp shire) discovered lately near Avoca, the miners also are 6anguine of success, and although the appearance of the quartz indicates its auriferous nature, yet in the absence of any having been crushed I am unable to give any positive results. Another quartz vein, situate about one and a half mile south of the Hampshire Reef, has also been lately discovered. Twenty claims have been taken up. The stone is similar in appearance to the Hampshire vein, and gold may be seen in the prospectors' claim, but they also not yet having had any quartz crushed, I cannot estimate the probable permanency of the work ings. In the other portions of my division mining continues in about the same state as when I sent in my last month's report, with the exception of Peter's Diggings, where the population is considerably on the decrease. I beg also to transmit to the honorable Board (with this month's report) plans of St. Arnaud and New Bendigo Diggings, with vertical sections of nome of the gold workings. The plans of St. Arnaud and New Bendigo Diggings comprise the original portion of alluvial and quartz workings first diseoveredin thatdistrict. New Bendigo Gully is situate about two miles in a north -westerly direction from the town of St. Arnaud, and is immediately between immensely high sandstone and mica schist ranges, and the water-course (from what is called the Gap) trend* north-west. Every facility here presents itself to collect (by artificial means and at a trifling outlay) a sufficient quantity of storm water both for domestic and mining purposes, there being an extensive area of precipitous catch-ground available, at a high level, for conveying the storm-water by means of Conwin'i open drains to reservoirs, which could easily be con structed for that purpose. The alluvial workings are about one and a half mile in length by a width averag ing five chains ; they consist of drift loam, which con tains gold from the surface to the bed-rock. The quartz- veins contiguous to the alluvial workings (as shown in plan) are evidently a continuation of one vein from the Gap Reef (situate on the belt of ranges Since my last report there have been no fresh dis tinguishing features in mining affairs, except two small rushes at Inkermann and Cockatoo Hill ; and the discovery of a new and promising quartz-reef at Have lock, called Harper's Reef. The latter is the most important event in mining matters during the month. The population is more of a settled character than it has been, in consequence of the more steady em ployment of the miners, many of whom have been forming themselves into mining companies, for the purpose of giving a more extensive trial to some of the abandoned gullies and quartz reefs. Machinery. \u2014 There are seven steam-engines, of the aggregate of 108-horse power ; 14 quartz-crushing machines, of the aggregate of 218-horse power ; and 350 puddling machines, now at work. Back Creek. \u2014 The four frontage leads, as well as the hard sinking wing of the Back Creek main lead, keep a large portion of the miners busily employed. Black Lead gives employment to 150 men, with favourable prospects, payable gold having already been traced as far as 10 claims. Shares on this lead vury in prices at present lrom \u00a350 to \u00a3150. Union Lead has 180 men engaged on it. Three shafts bottomed, two of which have struck gold. Shares are exceeding in price those of the Black Lead. Rocky Flat. \u2014 This lead had been abandoned, but is now rushed a second time. A persevering party of Welchmen having reaped the fruits of their labour by the discovery of gold in their claim of from 5dwt. to 7dwt. to the tub. This created a reaction, and now 240 men have secured claims on the lead. Mysterious Lead. \u2014 This lead is a supposed con tinuation of the old lead of the same name, and from the position of the gutter already traced from two ot the Bhafts, it is very probable that Black Lead and Rocky Flat will become one lead, the same as the Black and Union Leads. One hundred and twenty men are about commencing to work here. The sinking is about the same depth in the four leads \u2014 about 80 feet. Quartz Reefs. \u2014 Harper's Reef is traced through the centre of Slaughter-yard Hill, immediately on the west side of fiavelock Flat.

The Gap Reef was the first vein opened in this district, and is now abandoned, except one claim in the northernmost portion of the workings, which is held by a crushing machine com pany. The thickness of the vein, at a depth of 45 feet, is from 4 to 6 feet ; and although yielding only about three-quarters of an ounce of gold per ton, the proprie tors appear to work the same remuneratively. Thenext vein working on the same line is a portion lately opened ; the prospector's name is Shaw ; several claims are being worked, but with what results I have not yet ascertained. The two next portions shown on plan are only out-croppings, which have not yet been prospected. The lower section is Shewring's Reef, worked to the water-level, and ata depth of 170 feet. I stated in a former report that as much as 70oz. of gold to the ton of quartz had been obtained by crush ing from this reef, but, upon more minute inquiry, I find that 47oz. to the ton was the most ever obtained, and that only for a very small quantity. A lease is now being applied for for this portion of ground, in cluding a strip of the alluvial workings, comprising an area of 25 acres. Malleo Scrub Reef. \u2014 This vein has been partly worked, with what results I have not ascertained. An area of nearly 10 acres of this lode has been applied for, and surveyed for lease. The Armenian and Sebastopol Reefs also have been surveyed for lease. Upon the latter hill quite a pyramid of granulated quartz, 50 feet high, and 50 by 15 thick above the surface presents itself. I am informed that gold has been discovered in a por tion of this mass. The Armenian Reef has been a little prospected, and found lo contain gold, yet not sufficient to remunerate at the rate of crushing at that time and expensive mode of transit. varies from 2 to 6 feet (see vertical section No. 5). The average yield per ton is 2oz. Upon each of these hills, with systematic prospecting, I am of opinion that other auriferous veins would be discovered. These veins are, I find, a continuation of outcroppings ef the same character near Armenian Gully, the value of the latter not yet being ascertained. Water Supply. \u2014 On this side the dividing range from New Bendigo, ra tural facilities for supplying the town of St. Arnaud and adjacent workings with water present themselves, where also an immense area of water-shed, at a high level, together with the necessary sites for reservoirs are available. Any company formed to carry out the project alone, in this parched-up district, could not fail to be highly remunerative. Dr/NOLLY Division. (R. J. M'Millan, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Alluvial miners 4,220 Quartz miners 1,100 Men employed with machinery . . . . 146 5,466 The machines are as follows :\u2014 Armenian Gully (as shown on plan) is an alluvial working, ranging in depth of sinking from 8 to 18 feet, the alluvium being the same as that in the New Bendigo Gully. Not more than a claim wide of this gutter has' been worked two- thirds of the length of the lead, but that portion in some places was very remu nerative. These veins and alluvial workings are in the Mallee Scrub. The alluvial workings shown in plan from the Gap trend towards St. Arnaud town ship. The strata varies in thickness from 5 to 18 feet, also being of the same character as that of the other local alluvial workings. The bed-rock is mica, schist, and sandstone. Wilson's Reef.\u2014 There are six com panies working upon this vein :\u2014 Lewis's No. 2, sunktoa depth of 250 feet, thickness of reef 5 feet. Grigg's claim No. 3. Here the vein is 2 feet 6 inches thick at a depth of 45 feet. In the other four claims upon this vein the sinking is only shallow, and the yield per ton not more than three-quarters of an ounce ; yet from the fact of the auriferous portion being several feet thick, these companies are enabled to work the same remuneratively. The whole of this vein in clines to the west, the present angle being 35 degs. from the perpendicular. The average yield of gold per ton is l$oz. Ballarat Reef.\u2014 Only one claim, No 3 (see vertical section), is at present working upon this vein. No. 1 Claim, which is sunk to the water level, has remained unworked a considerable time, in consequence of the want of steam machinery neces sary to convey water from the workings to the sur face. This vein, although not auite in a line with Wilson's Reef, has the same angle\" of inclination, and yields 2oz. to the ton. Chrysolite Reef.\u2014 Two com panies are at present working this vein, which runs parallel to the Ballarat, and is precisely in a line with Wilson's Reef. The thick ness of v ein in No. 2 is 5 feet, and that of No. 3 (see vertical section), 2 feet 6 inches ; the yield aver ages 2oz. to the ton. No. 2 is sunk 198 feet deep, and No. 3 65 feet. This vein inclines slightly to the east. Westerly Reef.\u2014 Upon this vein four com panies are working. It is apparently only a spur, lying nearly perpendicular. This vein, together with the Chrysolite and Ballarat. which are contiguous parallel veins, at a certain level will undoubtedly con- Verge into one main reef. The thickness of this vein Very little alteration has taken place in alluvial mining in this division during the month, and there is no prospect of improvement at present, but quartz mining is progressing, especially in the vicinity of Sandy Creek. The various leads and gullies about Dunolly, the Hard Hills, and Burnt Creek, support a population of about 800 alluvial miners. These are all employed on the old workings, no new ground having been opened. The quartz-reefs at work in this part of the division are the Perseverance, Belgian, Staughtou, Hill, Fryer's, Erln-go-Bragh, and Murphy's Reefs. None of these are rich, the yields being from 8dwt. to 24 dwt. per ton ; but Perseverance, the most important, has a large body of stone, which is easily mined. It would pay well with efficient machinery on the spot. Moliagul, Wattle Plat, and Inkermann have a popu lation of about 900 alluvial miners, who are, with few exceptions, only earning a bare existence. The quartz-reefs at work here are Wayman's, Hogarth's, Queen's, Sheoak, Nuggety Point, Slaughter-yard Hill, Stewart Hill, and Jones's Reefs. One claim on Wayman's is very rich. For Hogarth's, Queen's, and Stewart's Hill, a 25 horse-power engine, with stampers, is in course of erection by the shareholders of the claims, who have formed themselves into a company. They are 30 in number, all working partners, and hold their ground under the Mining Board Regu lations. Cochrane's is almost deserted.

Korong. \u2014 The diggings here had become extremely dull during the month, chiefly owing to the scarcity of water. Many of the miners working in the scrub and outside gullies, were obliged to confine their opera tions to the old ground adjoining the township, whUa others left the field. A supply of rain came very op portunely at the end of the month, which will keep matters from getting worse for some time. Toward* the end of the mouth, a rush took place to a hill situ ated south of Opossum Point, towards Kingower. The sinking is very hard, many of the claims requiring to be blasted. At the time of my visit, the prospec tors alone were getting payable gold, at a depth of 26 feet. Three other shafts were then bottomed, at a less depth, but were not payable. The hardness of this ground is against its development, being very different from the general sinking at Korong. Should this rush prove auriferous to an extent to warrant its being worked, I shall send you a tracing illustrative of the sinking, having already made the necessary connection with the ground previously surveyed. Sandy Creek, with its tributaries, Tarnagulla diggings, the Hard Hills, and the various gullies in the neighbourhood, has a population of about 2,150 alluvial miners, of which the Hard Hills employ about 1,350, a few of whom are doing well. The reefs at work are Poverty, Victoria, Sabbath, Specimen, Honey, Stubb's, Watt's, Great Western, Needful, Mother Chisholm's, Corfu, Doubtful, German, Monte- bello, Hellas, and Antrim Reefs. Poverty continues its rich yield as it deepens. On the Poverty Reef Company's ground shafts are being sunk, and an en- gine erected for tbe prosecution of their work. In one of their shafts, east of the line of Poverty, the reef has been struck, and moderately rich stone is being taken out. On the north of the payable claims, Messrs. Beynon and Company's pumping and winding enginefortheir amalgamated claim is nearly completed, the main shaft of which is 300 feet deep, and in the water. Stubb's reef is yielding the prospectors lOoz. per ton, and two other claims are getting from 3oz. to 4oz. Hellas Reef crushed 9\u00a3oz. per ton. Corfu is getting good stone, but at present not of the extra- ordinary richness of their first and second crushings, which were about 20oz. per ton. I am informed that the stone being procured will not give more than 4oz. or 6oz. per ten. Several claims on Specimen Reef are crushing 3$oz. to 5oz. per ton. All the rest of the reefs above mentioned are getting gold in payable quantities. The leases granted and applied for altogether in this division are three of quartz-reefs, total length 1,936 yards ; and two of alluvial land, total 32 acres. At Sandy Creek, Dunolly, and Moliagul, three of alluvial land, total 62 acres ; and one of quartz-reef, 400 yards in length. [Mr. M'Millan has sent a tracing of the plan of his division, showing the situation of the various work ings.] Korong Division. (John Catto, Mining Surveyor.) The male population is as follows : \u2014 Quartz-mining is still in a backward condition, only a few tons of quartz having been crushed during the month. The proprietors of one of the crushing mills have made application for a lease of six acres of alluvial land, which they intend to wash by adding machines for the purpose to their engine. The Specimen Hill Quartz Crushing and Mining Company have got part of their machinery on the ground, and will soon commence its erection, when quartz-mining will be renewed with fresh energy. Kingower.\u2014 Mining affairs here have still a dull aspect. Although several small rushes have occurred during the month, nothing of importance has re sulted. The Union Reef is looking well throughout. The claimholders along the hill have all cut through the reef to the east side, and, in every instance, the gold is satisfactory. The Amalgamated Company's claim is still yielding good stone, but, owing to some repairs being made to their engine and boiler, mining operations were bus. pended for a fortnight. On the Bon Accord Eeef eight shafts are being sunk, but nothing payable has been discovered. No other payable reefs have been discovered, although several parties are prospecting. Fenton's.\u2014 These diggings are daily becoming of less importance. The population is gradually de creasing, and no new ground is likely to be opened. The few miners remaining are engaged driving the old holes, and occasionally sinking a fresh shaft. A fe\u00bb Chinese have found their way here, and are chiefly engaged washing tailings. Synnotfs.\u2014 These diggings are still without any im provement, and likely to remain so for some time, u the miners are so few in number that there is very little chance of any prospecting being resorted to. M'lntyre's.\u2014 These diggings have presented the same dull appearance as last month, and several of the miners have been induced to leave for other places. The amalgamated company on Marshall's Eeef are busily employed at a new shaft near to the spot where the first rich deposits were found. Twenty-five acres along the northern end of the hill have beei surveyed, and applied for on lease during the month. Jericho and Jordan's.\u2014 Quartz-mining here is falling off considerably, owing to the surface leaders, or veins, being mostly worked out, and as capital is very scarce, claimholders are unable to proceed to a depth sufficient to prove the ground. The prospectors are the only party at work on Petticoat Reef. They are em ployed in sinking a new shaft. On Black Beef only three parties have been employed during the month. on the Staffordshire Reef two claims are beinf worked On Patterson's Reef the prospecting claim only is at work On Milkmaid's Reef two claims ul being worked ; but nothing payable can be found.

Above three-quarters of a mile intervening between the Cumberland and Nuggety Reefs has been taken up, some claims yielding ex ceedingly well. One ton of quartz from the northern extension gave 49oz. ldwt., being the largest yield of matrix gold yet obtained on the Creek (Campbell's). The lucky party who found this rich quartz, com menced a prospecting shaft only six weeks ago at the end of the old' workings on Nuggety. Up to the present time they have had three lots crushed from as many different leaders, the two previous yields being 7oz. from 7 tons, and 3oz. 2dwt. from 2 tons. The leader from which the 49oz. were obtained is 1 foot thick, and auriferous throughout. It is 46 feet deep, and just above the water level. In alluvial mining nothing is being done except in the old ground. The scarcity of water is generally very great on these diggings. 183 tons of quartz have been crushed here during the month of October. The average yield is 13dwt. per ton, the highest being loz. 12dwt. This district has not remained dull for so long a period ever since its discovery, but as it is found gene rally highly auriferous wheiever sufficiently prospected, it cannot much longer escape the eyes of persevering and industrious prospectors. Neate and Company, in the next claim north, have also struck a payable lead. The prospecting party on the parallel reef, west of the Cumberland, have re alised 15dwt. per ton from the first lot of quartz they have had crushed. Two new reefs are being tested,\u2014 one near the Red Hill, and the other between the White Hill and Campbell's Creek road. CASTLEMAINE MINING DISTRICT. (Thomas Lawrence Brown, Mining Surveyor.)

The adjoining Flat following Campbell's Creek is being tried, but there is a strong underground drain age to contend with, which only powerful machinery will overcome. One ounce to the load, and in other claims from 2dwt. to 3dwt. to the tub, have been ob tained ; but the water cannot be overcome. A great number of tunnels are being driven into the Basaltic Hill in this neighbourhood, which are likely to afford constant and profitable employment for years to come to those who have the necessary capital and enterprise for such work. Specimen Gully Mining Association.\u2014 The whole of the machinery of this company is completed, and is the most powerful and substantial in the district. The main tunnel is now driven 355 feet in the line of the reef. Number of miners employed at reefing, 1,080. Total male or digging population, 2,523. Machinery. -There are 27 steam crushing machines, of the aggregate of 290 horse-power, 75 puddling machines, 13 horse-whims, and 3 hand-machines. There are also five crushing-machines in course of Forest Creek Gold Mining Company. \u2014 It has been resolved by the shareholders in this company that its affairs be wound up. In a previous report I gave a description of their machinery and workings. The principal cause of failure is the exhausted state of the claim and the expense of working. Since the 2nd August last, 5,859 loads have been washed, which have yielded gold worth \u00a3715 12s. 7d. To obtain this, it cost for labour alone, \u00a31,655 Ss. 5d. The average from each load was 13gr. The claim is now so much worked and unsafe that it would be folly to proceed. erection, and three idle. The following applications have been made during the last month :\u2014 Barker's Creek Prospecting Association have been prospecting several reefs, some of which are likely to yield well. From Nicholson's Gully Reef, out of % of a ton of quartz they obtained 3oz. lOdwt. of gold, and they are now taking out payable quartz. Another reef opened by them, the Bonaventura, is situate on the dividing range between Barker's Creek and the Bendigo-road, immediately at the junction of the granitic and metamorphic rocks It is a large body, with a dip divided by a bank of sandstone into easterly and westerly spurs. Gold is found on the western face, and ail the alluvial is auriferous, as every dish washed yielded fine gold. A third reef opened by the com pany > the Hermitage, gives every prospect for work ing ; it is in an admirable position, and the indications are very favourable, the quartz being very porous and charged with sulphurets. The applications for abandoned reefs occur at Dunn's Reef, Sandy Creek, Ladies (three instances), Bell's, Italian Reef (not granted), Telegraph, Gougb's, Church Hill, Lisle's (two instances), on a reef near Peg Leg, reef west of Lisle's Reef, and Uncle's Reef. Those, for amalgamation are at the Camp Reef, Swiper's Reef, Brewer's Reef, Beehive Reef, and South Eaglehawk Reef. Puddling-machines and Dams.\u2014 There are seven ap plications and lour inclusive for dams only. These occur at Sandy Creek (two instances), Seventy-foot Hill, North Muckleford, Eaglehawk Gully, Porcupine Flat, and Smith's Reef. There are thiee applications for ground in connec tion with machinery, of the total area of 5 acres 2 roods. These occur at Wattle Gully Reef, Eaglehawk Gully, and Sailors' Gully. There are five applications for ground in connection with puddling-machines\u2014 one at Porcupine Flat and four at Nuggety Flat. There are four applications for water-holes for domestic purposes, at Long Gully and at Sandy Creek. Chewton Sluicing Company. \u2014 The machinery of the Chewton Sluicing Company is erected. The engine, of 20-horse power, works beautifully. The pipes are laid for carrying the water to the top of the hill, a distance of 1,200 feet, and rise 60 feet, and the manager is now exercising his ingenuity in endeavouring to lower the water in the Argus shaft sufficiently to put the force pump in place, on the accomplishment of which working operations are expected to commence. The machinery of this company is an engine and force pump, for raising water to the crown of the hill to sluices, through which it is proposed to pass all wash able dirt. There are two applications for the protection of quartz tailings at Eaglehawk. Twelve hundred yards of water privilege have been applied for between Tiverton Reef and Growler\"! Gully. The new rush at Sandy Creek, alluded to in my last report, seems likely to extend towards the township of Maidon.

Trimble and Co. have applied for a mining lease of upwards of seven acres. Wombat Reef, Connell's Reef, and a number of others, although not yielding extraordinarily, are paying the parties engaged. The Cosmopolitan, on Commis sioners' Reef, have opened a drive towards the reef at a depth of 90 feet, and I hope next month to be able to report a successful result of their prospecting. In Yandoit, Clement's Reef is still turning out good stone, and nearly all the claims on Christmas Reef are in full work. The Yandoit Quartz Mining Company's crushing plant will probably be completed in three or four weeks, when I shall be enabled to furnish more details than I can at present. Old German Reef is being prospected, and it is be lieved that a large quantity of quartz will pay, with machinery on the ground. Some very rich stone was obtained when the reef was originally opened, and I share the general opinion that, by a large way ef working, this reef will prove a safe speculation. Puddling and sluicing have during the month past not undergone any visible change, and will, by the present dry weather, soon be stopped for the season. No instances of remarkable success have come to my knowledge, nor could such, in fact, be expected at a time when, by the unsteady supply of water, the best parts of several days in the week are lost. There are exceptions, but on an average I do not think the majority of claims have paid above ordinary wages. A large number of claims are being registered every week, for the season, for want of water, and the population on our various creeks is gradually remov ing towards Boots and Yandoit, settling there for the summer.

In alluvial sinking matters have till lately been very dull, with the exception of Kangaroo or New Nuggety Gully, where, some time ago, it was rumoured that several good patches and nuggets of no mean size had been discovered, and in consequence, a number of miners from Forty-foot and the surround ing gullies were attracted ; and I believe that most of the parties working the old ground systematically have had no reason to regret their perseverance. The following table shows the approximate number of persons actually engaged in mining :\u2014 I have no doubts, from the geological formation and general appearance of the country, that in the summer new ground will be opened between Boots, Yandoit, and Deep Creek. Tunnelling. \u2014 In this branch of mining I have to report a rush to Deep Creek, which promises to be of some importance, and I have the honour to forwaid a sketch of the ground for your information. The ground opened is situate 9\u00a3 miles from Mount Frank lyn, and 4\u00a3 (?) miles from Smeaton Hill, and forms part of those large basaltic plains extending from the Deep Creek to the west of Clunes. The prospecting tunnel has been working eight or nine months, and has struck a deposit of auriferous gravel (indicated on the sketch by a blue colour), which promises to reward amply their perseverance. There are four steam crushing machines at work, four horse crushing-machines idle, and five water crushing-machines idle. There are 73 horse puddling machines at work and 25 idle. There are three horse whims at work, and thi ee idle. There are two steam pumps at work, five water-pumps at work, and three idle. Applications entertained during the month of Oc tober : \u2014 The gold is coarser than is usually found in any of the ancient leads\u2014 a nugget of 14oz., and a number of smaller ones having been reported as discovered, and fine gold is so scare that no cradling is required. The ground has not yet been opened to such an extent as to enable me to express any decided opinion as to the existence of any properly- defined gutter ; but the reef gone through consists of a soft white sandstone. Some of the tunnels started will probably soon break through, and then I shall be able to make the necessary sur veys for my guidance. The stuff is not very different from the other old leads, and I have no doubt that this rush will lead to very important discoveries under these plains. In the Old Tunnel Hills, Elevated Plains, &c, matters have remained much the same during the month, most of the tunnels having broken throuarh years ago, and of the few going in \" on prospect,\" I have not heard of any broken through lately. I have great pleasure in being able to report a very satisfactory state *f mining matters in general. In quartz-mining nothing remarkable has occurred. A new reef, called Taylor's Reef, has been lately opened near Yandoit, and showB a very fair prospect. The old reefs, if not very rich, still pay by the present im proved way of working. On Parker's Specimen Reef, head of Dry Diggings, things are looking brisk, several claims having lately been taken up, and the quartz raised shows very well, but in consequence of the only machine in that neighbourhood (Mr. Wilson's, on Middleton Creek) undergoing repair, no quartz I No. of Crushings.

Two other companies are about to be formed\u2014 one for working about 300 yards of the Yarra, com mencing at Anderson's Creek Punt, and working1 downwards ; and the other company propose working that part of the river below Anderson's Creek known as the Pound Bend. At this part of the river a tunnel of about 10 chains in length will drain about three miles of the river, supposed to be highly auriferous. With reference to the newly-discovered Yarra Yarra Gap gold-field, I beg to state that it is situated near the falls, on the left bank of the river, above the Gap, and about 16 miles from Briarty's station. St. Andrew's Division. (James Murphy, Mining Surveyor.) The approximate mining population is as follows : \u2014 Europeans 606 Chinese 137 Total 743 Machinery.\u2014 There are six quartz-crushing machines, of the aggregate of 42-horse power, of which four are at work and two idle. There are 11 puddling-machines, of which five are at work and six idle. A considerable decrease has taken place in the total number of miners, but, on looking at the table, it will be seen that this decrease is greatest among the Chinese. I have also ascertained that the place is highly auriferous, and wholly unsuited for the miner who depends upon tub and cradle washing ; but large parties of miners combined, and with some capital to commence with, will no doubt do well on that, gold field. The washing-stuff is within a few inches of the surface, and varies in thickness from 1 to 4 feet, rest ing on soft granite. The \" colour\" is to be found everywhere ; but not in sufficient quantity to pay for tub-washing. No thing will do but sluicing. As a rule, the gold is fine ; but some pieces varying in weight from ldwt. to 17dwt. have been found. There is only one party at work, and they are said to be doing very well. The rest of the miners are em ployed in prospecting, cutting races, and building dams. Taking everything into consideration, and especially the fact that capitalists are now beginning to turn their attention to this gold-field, I think I am right in saying that mining matters are consequently im proved, and that mining operations are assuming a character of permanency and extent that must eventually develope the ample resources of this di vision. [Mr. Murphy has furnished a general map, showing the situation of the gold-fields in his division.] On One-Tree Hill the results of all the claims at work are satisfactory, except those on the Victoria Reef. Messrs. Holmes, Randle, and Ricards, who have leased 41 acres of auriferous land on One-Tree Hill, are expected to commence tunnelling through the hill almost immediately. They have selected a most eligible mill site, on the Old Caledonia Creek, where they propose erecting quartz-crushing machinery on a very extensive scale, and besides crushing their own quartz, I am led to believe that they will crush quartz for the miners, at about \u00a31 per ton. On the Yow Yow Reefs the results are most satis- factory in every claim now being worked ; and on Barker's Reef claims that have lain unworked for many months are now found to be very valuable. Every claim in this reef is taken up. A new auriferous quartz vein has been discovered at Cherry-Tree Gully. The yield of gold is not known. This vein is very thin, being only about two inches in thickness. At Anderson's Creek tunnelling operations are vigorously carried on by Messrs. Moore and Gerraghty, on the Fourth Hill. They have now tun nelled 40 feet, but have not met with any quartz. It is considered that they will meet with the old vein at about 200 feet. At Anderson's Creek, Messrs. Clark and Brown are pushing on their work at Thompson's Lead with con siderable vigour, and have now 30 men employed on Note.\u2014 No reports have been received from Mr. Mining Surveyor Poeppel, Fryer's Creek; Mr. Shepard, Taradale ; and Mr. Woolgrove, Steiglitz.

BALLARAT MINING DISTRICT. prospected by means of sinking for some years to come, on account of the depths, and the difficulties to be overcome, but which might, by means of boring, be prospected at a compiratively small cost. Upon the Inkerman Lead the several companies are working steadily ; but the total yield from this lead during the past is not so good as the previous month's. The Tannery Company has bottomed at a depth of 175 feet, and is now sinking in the reef, intending to sink to the supposed depth of the gutter, and then to drive in a north-easterly direction for it. The Southern Cross Company is sinking about 800 feet from and to the north-east of the T vinery Company's shaft ; and its shaft is now about 100 feet deep. There is a com- pany about to commence linking to the west of the Southern Cross, and to the north-west of the Tannery Company. I expect tr-\" t the last-mentioned shafta will shortly prove the course of the Inkerman Lead. Upon the Nightingale and Malakoff Leads, there is nothing new to report. The yield from these leads is poor at present. Upon the Milkmaid's Lead, the yield is moderately good. Upon the Redan Lead, the Golden Gate Company is still sinking. Quartz Reefs.\u2014 The Township Quartz-reef Company has at length completed the erection of its crushing machinery, and will commence crushing in a few days. The adjoining company has suspended opera- tions for the purpose of increasing the number of shareholders, and obtaining machinery. Quartz-reefs ara beginning to engage the attention of the miners at Ballarat, and there is every reason to believe that there are several rich reefs in this district. At Campbell's Diggings the principal part of the mining is being carried on at Sago Hill, at which place most of the claims are vi-'lding good wages. The greatest depth at which the lead has been struck. is 105 feet. No. 1 Division. (Robert Davidson, Mining Surveyor.) Mining on the whole is very dull, nor is it likely to be much different under existing circumstances. As the shallow auriferous ground in this division has already been worked two or three times, there can be nothing rich expected from that source, and the work ings of the deep leads under the present system is a tedious proceeding. Upon the Gravel Pits Lead there are at present only two companies at work \u2014 viz., the Little Engine Company and the Old Gravel Pits Company (second party), and it is expected that the Little Engine Company will have worked its claim out in about two months from the present time. The Old Gravel Pits Company is being worked by a second party with moderate success. Upon the Golden Point Lead the New Constitution Company is engaged in blocking out their ground, and will in all probability be worked out in three months. The Cosmopolitan Company has every reason to be satisfied with the yield of the gutter in its claim. The Koh-i-noor Company is progressing steadily and satis factorily. The Band of Hope Company is still sinking. The Grand Trunk or Great River Company has decided upon boring for deep ground, and is now calling for tenders for that purpose. Hitherto boring has been found to be a very expensive and not very satisfactory mode of prospecting, but I am inclined to think that this was the effect of mismanagement in the applica tion rather than any defect in the system of boring, and it is to be hoped that it will prove effectual in this instance, as there is an immense extent of country to the westward of Ballarat, which I fear will not be"], [142, "4 MINING SURVEYORS REPORTS.

The greater number of these companies are obtaining an average rate of wages On Dead Horse Gully and in the neighbourhood there are 28 companies holding claims. Owing to the scarcity of water, there is not much doing in alluvial mining ; but a great many of the miners have turned their attention to prospecting the numerous quartz reefs in the vicinity. The Caledonia Company, holding a claim at the junction of Dead Horse and California Gullies, are erecting machinery for the purpose of washing the old workings. The ground in their neighoourhood being rather level, they have erected their puddling machines at an elevation of 12 feet from the surface, so as to enable them to get rid of the sludge. An other system, lately introduced at Ballarat, has been ad-wpted by this company, that is, having slip panels in the bottoms of their machines, through which the wash-dirt passes into the sluice more quickly and with far less trouble than by the old method. This company will soon be compelled to cease work through a want of water. At the Springs there are 32 companies at work, beiDg enabled to continue operations in consequence of the greater water supply of that locality. They are, as far as I can learn, making fair wages. In a short time not a few companies in t tis part of the dis trict will be forced to discontinue operations owing to the greater part of the dams and reservoirs being nearly tilled with sludge, and consequently rendered useless.

These 40 tons were all obtained at a depth ot 40 to 60 feet, and generally all over the reef, I have ascertained that the best returns have been got at about the same depth. Still it is the opinion of many on the reef who are sinking to a depth of about 200 feet that when they strike the main vein or lode at that depth the yield will be superior to anything yet found. Whim Holes. \u2014 Two of the companies mentioned in my last report are each now down to a depth of up wards of 80 feet. One cf them, the Progressive Com pany, has just got itrt engine ready for steaming ; the other, the Young Eastern Company, is getting down with the windlass alone, having as yet got no water or drift to interfere with the sinking. Two other large claims have been recently taken up, making in all upwards of two miles of the flat or gully now in occupation, and if either of the first-named companies obtain even a medium prospect, the wnole of the ground down as far as the Buuinyoug Race course will be at once occupied, as the Ballarat miners are now heartily sick of the deep rock leads, and would be most anxious to exchange them for such a place as this, where the average sinking is not likely to be more than 150 feet, with comparatively no diffi culty in tbe way of lo-jk and water. In the old worked gullies between here and the Little Hard Hills, there are some 12 or 15 persons at work on large claims taken up under by-law 10, and I believe, generally speaking, they are all making fair wagec, as are also some 8 or 10 other persons, who have some time back taken up claims in old, worked gullies, about two or three miles to the south-west of the Hard Hills. There is nothing of interest to be reported of the Frenchman's, White Horse, or Cobbler's Lead, as they are all, I may say, as usual ; not so, however, in the neighbourhood of the Black Lead, where matters are improving. The Scottish and Cornish Company, on the west side of the i arrowee Creek, have lately got into some very good wash-stuff. Penrose Reef, Moonlight Flat, remaina about the same as already reported. No. 1 South has struck the vein at 6u feet, but cannot find anything like the stone found in the prospecting claim. The party, however, resolutely perservere, and entertain strong hopes of ultimate remuneration. Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 South and No. 1 North, though being well worked, have as yet proved blanks. Mount Misery i eef. \u2014 2,100 feet in length, by 600 in width, of this reef have been taken up under by law 10, by the Midland Counties Quartz-mining and Crushing Company, who purpose getting powerful machinery on the ground as soon as possible. Pinchgut Reef\u2014 The Germanic CuDfederation Com pany are still working vigorously, and have just made arrangements for the purchase of a 35 or 40 horse power engine, with which they intend working a battery of 24 stamps, &c. Mount Misery Creek is still almost exclusively in the possession of the Chinese, aud from the fact that the population receives fresh accessions weekly, I am disposed to believe they are working to some account. A party of four Europeans lately got \u00a3200 per man Rokewood.\u2014 In the gullies\u2014 Raglan, Break-o'-Day, &c\u2014 about two miles northward of the township of Rokewood, several old ground grants have been taken up during the month under by law 10, and I find that it is the intention of some to erect machinery of sufficient power to work the ground in the most ap proved and systematic manner. Moonlight Flat, Bull-Dog Creek, and Hill's and Doctor's Hill are in rather good repute at present. Several new claims have been occupied, and those being worked for some time past seem to give satisfac tory returns.

Sd. per man per week for two and a half years. In shaft No. 3, 1 am informed that the yield of gol i is not, on au average, over that of No. 2, and that several of the share holders have left the claim. Shaft No. 4, although working for nearly three years, is not yet bottomed. This, I attribute principally to the immense volume ot water to be raised, and the want of efficient machinery. The company have now obtained a powerful engine, and anticipate shortly to get into the gutter; great inducements are held out to them to proceed with energy, as they will, in all probability, have a junction with Scotchman's Lead. At .he point A, on the southern boundary of Lear month's Pre-emptive Right, the course of the trap rock, running in a southerly direction, is clearly de fined ; and it is not unreasonable to expect that, a about this point, the Scotchman's Lead will ente Crown lands, and tLence flow on to the Durham. Shafts 5 and 6 are busily engaged in driving for the gutter. Shaft No. 7 has during the month struck the gutter at a depth of 2t>5 feet, but not having >et clearly de fined the reefs, I have postponed forwarding a section until more detailed information can be furnished. The average yield so far, I am informed, is about half an ounce to 20 cubic feet, a great improvement on that obtained from the upper part of the lead. I may here mention that reports have beeu published that prospects of 2oz. to a tin dioh were obtained out of this claim ; but this was on account of the ground being fossicked, and by no means an average yield.

In No. 9 the shareholders have adopted a different system from all the other companies in prosecuting their search for the gutter \u2014 namely, by driving an incline to a depth of 303 feet below the surface, trom which a drive has been put in for upwards of 2S6 feet in reef. On ac count of private property adjoining this company's ground, 1 have been unable to mark off ground pro portionate to the number of men ; but should the gutter not hold the present supposed course, the full amount can be laid off on Crown lands. On the shallow workings the increasing want of water is being severely felt, and in consequence mauy of the miners are holding their claims in reserve. On the leaseholds of the Edenborough Company and the Linton Gold Mining Company no work has been commenced ; but on the Atlas, which adjoins them to the southward, boring has been carried on for some time back, the result of which has already proved the deep ground to lie either within the boundary of Linton's pre-emptive right, or in close contiguity to its western fence. There is nothing particular to mention in respect of the shallow workings in this neighbourhood. At Spring Dallah, the company of that name have proved a run of deep ground proceeding from the old lead, and have obtained a claim of 1,800 feet long. They are a considerable depth with their shaft. Lower down the creek some parties have got payable gold in the bed of the creek, and a rush has set in there. The tunnel parties mentioned in my last report are making very good progress, but have not yet reached the object of their arduous search. At Happy Valley, the North American Company are over 100 feet in the rock, and are not yet through. This is the deepest of that description of sinking yet sunk here. At Brown's no little excitement has been caused by the report of a new lead being discovered on Budgeon's Flat. The prospects are excellent, but up to the pre sent confined to the one claim. There are several holes nearly bottomed. Monkey Gully is getting on prosperously. The lead which was noticed in my last as having been dis covered in the lease claims of the Havelock, Falcon, and Morning Star Companies, has been traced to the eastward, through the Hartly, Northern, and Cri terion Companies. The Success Company, still fur ther to the eastward, have attained a depth which indicates its passage through their claims also. l_Mr. Lynch states that mining operations are much brisker on the Black Ball Lead, which he ascribe* solely to the encouragement given by the increase in the size of the claims. Mr. Lynch has given a de scription of the various companies on this lead, j Several companies on the shallow end of the Derwent Jack's Gully have bottomed too shallow, and removed to the deeper ground on the western end of the gully. Nearly two miles of thejjully are taken possession of in block claims. Carngham continues still its steady progress. The Great Britain Company, in Snake Valley, are erectin? an engine. The Rob Rny Company are sinking a second shaft ; they are about 60 feet in the rock. They got gold in the former shaft, but not in the right run. The Sherwood Company got a little gold, but not in payable quantities. The Gnome Company are 96 feet deep, and through the rock. The Baron Clvae Company are 72 feet in the rock ; the United Miners, tiO feet. There are several parties prospecting for quartz reefs, the yield which the Britannia claim gave (nearly 19dwt. to the ton for 7 tons) no doubt stimulating to further research. On Preston's Hill, where the claims are on private property, mining is reported to be, as usual, in a very prosperous condition. Creswick Division. (James Stevenson, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows : \u2014 As to the quartz mining, I am happy to say that, owing to some of the companies in the Ballarat district having been successful, the miners are showing an anxiety to obtain claims on the various reefs, which, although partially abandoned by previous occupants, will, with the aids of machinery and proper manage ment, yield certainly a payable return.

Linton's. \u2014 There is no division of the district re- ceiving so much attention as Linton's. Every day brings large accessions to its population. The pick and shovel of the prospector are plied busily in every range and gully ; and in very few in stances has his efforts failed in securing a splendid hope of reward. That portion of the Standard Lead occupied under the frontage system is turning out admirably. I par ticularised in my last report the average returns of the several claims bottomed. During the past month they have steadily advanced in value. The Block claims, on the continnation of the lead, are all in very forward stages of progress. To the westward of the Standard Lead, a new gully has been opened, called the Flagstaff, which promises well. There are eight blocks of great extent already taken up, and the process of sinking is going forward with a degree of energy which betokens the high fa vour in which it stands. The Black Ball Lead, ahead of the John Bull claim, for a long time in dubious uncertainty as to its paying qualities, has within the month established its claim to the rank of a prize lead, and as such it is now re garded by its occupiers. The Redan Company, after overcoming difficulties of no ordinary magnitude, have succeeded in reaching the gutter, where they found gold in such quantities as satisfied them that their outlay has been profitably n vested.

(I. B. Cusack, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows I have the honour to report that, on the 20th of November, the continuation of the run of gold from Spring Hill was struck by Edwards and party near its junction with the Black Ball Lead. This party, having obtained permission from the Municipal Council, sunk their shaft in Bridge-street, and struck gold at a depth of 35 feet. The wash-dirt varies from two to three feet in depth. The breadth, so far as it is ascertained, is about 90 feet, and the yield 3dwt. to the tub. The Municipal Council have given permis sion for any parties to mine on the ground, provided security is given for repairing the streets. Conse quently all the ground from Cambridge- street, along Bridge-street and Napier-street to the Black Lead, a distance of 1,653 feet, is taken up, and also some of the private property on each side.

Kangaroo Reef. \u2014 This reef is now in possession of a company under leasehold, and is now in full work. They have purchased an engine (10-horse power) from Messrs. Walsh. It is situated in a gully north of the company^ ground, and has a permanent supply of water. Three shafts are being worked, having a horse whim so situated as to be used alternately as required. The first crushing since the company commenced work was completed last week. The quantity crushed wes 85 tons, taken out at depths of 80, 110, and 146 feet, and to the south of any previous workings on the reel ; the yield was half an ounce per ton. The main shaft of the company is 256 feet deep, but no drives are opened deeper than 190 feet. The quartz of this reef is very solid, of a dark colour, and slightly trans parent. In the seams the faces are much covered with oxyde of iron. The rock ou both sides of the reef is a hard brown sandstone. At Bald Hills diggings the prospecting party is the only party who have yet bottomed. The extreme depth of the shaft is 110 feet, viz., six feet of black loamy clay, 22 fer-t of blue-stone, 76 of sandy clay, and 6 feet of gravel and wash-dirt. The gold is coarse, and averages a quarter of an ounce to the load. 10 claims are marked off and at work. The principal place at Creswick, where new ground is being worked, and to which all the veins of gold coming from the east and south of Creswick tend, is the Red Streak. It is the deepest ground, and is going in a north-easterly direction. Parker's Reef.\u2014 The Gordon Parker's Company are working in two shafts, the depths of which are 230 and 240 feet respectively, having a whim commanding both shafts, and worked by double ropes at the same time. They are about sinking a new shaft 100 feet east of the present ones, to a depth of 400 feet, to meet the reef, which is dipping in that direction. The prospect claim, which is at the south end of the com pany's ground, have had 90 tons crushed. It yielded l\u00a3oz. per ton. [Here Mr. Stevenson gives a full description of the claims at work on it.] Two claims on the Hard Hills have been taken up for the purpose of working and crushing the cement, which on this hill is about 3 feet in thickness, and is highly auriferous. On one of them a 12-horse power engine, with 12 heads of stamps, is in course of erection. Fishei's Reef. \u2014 There is only the prospect claim at work on this reef. The last quantity, taken from a depth of 80 feet, yielded 13 dwt. per ton. The reef is 6 feet thick, but only an average of 18 inches of the eastern side is taken out. The reef is much broken, and consequently easily worked. The joints are filled with a soft pipeclay on the eastern side ; and on the western side, the rock is a brown sandstone, contain ing numerous quartz leaders, varying in thickness from half an inch to 6 inches. The only quartz-reef at present working at Cres wick is Frenchman's Reef. No machinery is yet at work, but Evans and Company (prospecting party) and James and Company are raising stone of a very rich looking kind. It will be a month at least before any of it can be crushed. Clunes.\u2014 Since my last report nothing fresh has oc curred beyond continuing the various levels then opened, except in the case of one or two companies sinking their shafts preparatory to opening out and pursuing their workings at a further depth. The Mount Hope Company are now busy erecting their machinery. It is a 35-horse-power engine, with King's patent circular revolving stampers. It is in tended by the company to commence operations in the mines this week. [Mr. Stevenson gives a full description of the work ings and machinery of the various companies in this portion of his district. With respect to the Port Phillip Company, he says : \u2014 \"The result of this com pany's crushing shows an improvement in the yield of the quartz raised by the Clune3 Company in Octo ber by 4dwt. 5gr. per ton ; the average for the month being loz.

Mr. Stevenson mentions an invention of Mr. Rob3on, the manager of the crushing depart ment. Port Phillip Company, by which he has suc ceeded in lessening the labor of amalgamating, and Mr. Stevenson has given a description of the mode of working and the results arrived at. Respecting the water supply at Clunes, he says :\u2014 \" The Port Phillip Company, in conjunction with three other quartz crushing companies, have accepted tenders for the completion of the large dam, situated about 1 mile up the creek. When finished, it wiil throw back water nearly 3 miles. The work will be under the superin tendence of the engineers of the Port Phillip Com pany.\"] The Outward - Bound, Homeward - Bound, and Opossum Reefs are now held by lease, but have not commenced work yet. Mount Ea-erton.\u2014 Large Hill Reef.\u2014 There are five claims at work on this reef. The quartz is of a porous character. The rock is a white sandstone, with seams of pipeclay and clay-slate. On both sides of this reef there are several quartz leaders, varying from 5 inches to 2\u00a3 feet in thickness, and all containing gold. Alluvial Mining.\u2014 All Nations Gully .\u2014The number of miners in this gully is reduced to about 18. The west or shallow end of this gully has been worked se veral times for a distance of 200yards : at the east end, where the depto. attained 80 feet, very little is done. I believe, if the eastern or deep end of this gully were prospected, a good paying gutter would be found, from the fact, that in the portion worked several dis tinct veins were found, all of which paid the miner good wages, and they have spread over a considerable width of the gully, exceeding 200 feet, showing the amount of deposit, which will almost to a certainty join, as it goes into narrower and deeper formation of the gully. The Little Hill\u2014 On this reef a little work was done lately, and some quartz crushed from it, but it did not"], [146, "8 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS. pay for workiug, so, for the present, it is at a stand still.

A party, some few weeks since, took up a reef aban- doned for 3 years, known as the Daylight Reef, west- ward of Moonlight Reef (see general plan), and oae crushing realised 12oz. per ton. The Redan party are at a standstill in their working! considering the extent and value of their ground. They are working the old and comparatively exhausted ground. The Scotchman's Reef prospect party still continue their operations, and with success and good results. Their last crushing produced, I believe, 3^oz. per ton. The Birmingham Reef prospect claim is still pro-' ducing payable quartz, which will average nearly as much as previous crushings. The Dolly's Creek Diggings are proceeding favour ably. A lead has been found running from Brown'3 Hill, north to Campbell's Hill. The sinking isfrom 10 feet to 30 feet in depth, and promises to be of some great extent. I have heard that from 18dwt. to loz. per load has been obtained. Morrison's Diggings, on the Moorabool, are at present comparatively quiet. Several large claims have been taken up under By-law X, Schedule B. The miners are collecting their washing-stuff, to be in readiness lor the newmachine for washing, &e., which is in course of erection. Stkiolitz Division. (Thomas Woolgiove, Mining Surveyor.)

The entire change produced on operations by so much of the mining ground being taken up by joint stock companies led to the hope that under new management operations would have by this time bo far proceeded as to enable me to forward returns, ac companied with plans and sections of the various companios* workings. In this there is disappoint ment ; and judging from preliminary operations, with few exceptions, we look in vain, under the new management of the companies, for symptoms which would excite hopes of results, different from the co operative labour association, where labour \u2014 the pick, gad, and ehovel \u2014 was to do everything. Since my last report the Steiglitz Quartz-Mining Company have placed on their ground all the material of a large and powerful steam-engine, with pumping apparatus, &c. Their winding and pumping shaft has been nearly completed to the depth of 170 feet \u2014 i.e., to the water level. The size of the shaft is 8 feet by 5 feet iu tbe clear. The cost of the shaft has been \u00a3544, including frames, timbering, &c. The estimated cost ot the whole of the works, when finished, is \u00a34,500. The contractors for enlarging and framing the en gine shaft of the Perseverance Company have nearly completed their work to the depth of 160 feet. At that depth the shaft is underlying, and it is not yet decided by the directors whether the perpendicular shaft is to be continued or the old vein worked on as before. The Moorabool Gold Mining and Water Com pany have not yet taken any steps to proceed with operations on the land they lease, which is 60 acres in extent.

The old German Reef, now known as the Welling ton Quartz Company, remains iu the same position as far as progress is concerned, as when I last reported. It3 area is 600 yards by I6t>i yards, and no one is working on it. It has averaged 2oz. per ton, is good and easy working ground, and has two steady veins in it. The population is remaining stationary. In alluvial mining, the same dulness still exist* in my district as reported in my last. This is cauted by the parties engaged in mining being obliged to work old ground, which has, in some instances, been worked two and three times hefore. Such ground, as may be naturally expected, does not yield remunerative re turns. There are a few parties who have been earning good wages, say from \u00a35 to \u00a310 per week per man, but Buch instances are very rare. Some payable ground has been struck on a hill on the south side o the Lerderderg Creek, and north-west from Kangaroo Flat, employing 10 or 12 miners. The gold is chiefly found in a layer of gravel, about two feet from the bed rock. The layer of gravel frequently contains more gold than the reef Simmons' Reef has been turning out some very good stone.

The Italian Reef Company, 900 by 300 yards, have stayed their operations tor the present, as it is impos sible until quartz-mining companies produce some pro fitable results to form a company to work this land efficiently. The Gibraltar party, on the 12th of last month, handed over to the new company the whole of their property, and have just commenced operations under the new company's management.

With respect to general mining operations, they are, on the whole, in a very satisfactory state. Wages range from \u00a33 10s. to \u00a34 per week. At Wombat Creek one or two parties were working at the head, and although auriferous, they found it would not pay. Near its junction with the Muddy Creek one or two parties still continue at work. Some distance up Clear Creek and Kinchington's Creek there are a few parties at work, but with what success I am unable to say. Near the junction of Clear and Yackandandah Creeks a good many parties are at work surface sluicing. Some of the ground about here is very good. In one claim, in a little gully running into Clear Creek, as much as \u00a3100 per share per week has been obtained. There were four share holders at the time employing 12 men. There is, in my opinion, ample ground in this dis trict which would prove remunerative for sluicing purposes, if there was only a good supply of water. The Pioneer Company will materially assist to remedy this want, but many times as much water as they oau At Beechworth the population is estimated at 3,121 making a total for the division of 10,383. The population are, from the nature of these diggings, in a very settled condition, and they are generally, I believe, making good average wages, while many are making from two to five times the average. Machinery. \u2014 There are 11 puddling-machines, namely, six at the Three-Mile (four of which are at work), one at the Two-mile, and four at Pennyweight Flat. There are 10 steam-engines, of the aggregate of 96 horse-power. The nature of these diggings is such as to depend in a great measure upon a large supply of water. This supply has been greatly increased since the district was first opened up, both by the numerous drives into the hills adjoining the various creeks, and also (where over there appeared the sign of a spring) by the cutting into the ground, so as to allow a free vent for the water. From Bowman's Forest there is not as yet much to report. Two or three parties are sinking shafts, but gold in payable quantities has not been found. The original shaft has been abandoned, and the proprietors of the steam-engine have recommenced their labours a considerable distance lower down toe flat. As the Woolshed Creek has much less fall than Reid's Creek, the miners prefer draining their ground either by water-wheels or steam-power. For driving the water-wheels, the water is taken out of the creek by races, and brought to bear upon them, and this in creases the supply of water to parties lower down the reek. The miners have all preferred raising the water by an endless band with metal buckets attached ; by this means a great deal of power iB wasted, both in the fall of water back into the well, and also by the buckets going down and up, sometimes through several feet of water.

Suffolk Lead.\u2014 The lower part of this lead is still holding out good prospects. One claim has haua depth of from 2 to 4 feet of washdirt, and has been averaging from \u00a330 to \u00a360 per week per man. The ground, however, is very patchy, and the next claim, although it has been worked for six or seven months, has not turned out wages. The upper part of thia lead is being worked by Chinamen, and is said to be giving them good wages. New Ballarct Lead.\u2014 Only one other Bhaft has been bottomed since my last from No. 2 section, Plan 5, to the Nil Desperand'um, which, judging from the wash dirt, the claimholders think will average from \u00a310 to \u00a320 a man per week. Stockyard. \u2014 This is now considered old and aban doned ground, although a few parties on it are stil averaging good wages. Since my last report two other leads have been found\u2014 1st. The Stanley Lead (November 2), Stock yard Gully, near Murray's Station, is likely to be a very long lead. Only one shaft, besides the pro spectors', has yet bottomed. From the prospects obtained the lead is likely to prove very rich ; 4jdwt. to the oil-can were obtained from amalgamated claims 12 and 13 south, with a depth of two feet of wash dirt. The other new lead has been named the Italian Lead, and is heading in a small gully at Albray's Reef.

This lead is likely to run into the New Ballarat Lead. Quartz-Reefs. \u2014 I have heard of no new discoveries of reefs this month. Reports are current that com panies are being formed to work some of the old leaders or reefs. Neither of the quartz-machines have been kept nearly employed during the month. The quartz which has been crushed averaged l\u00a3oz. to the ton. bring in could be fully employed, particularly about the Lower Yackandandah, where numbers ot suriace hills are untouched. \u201e _ .

Machinery. \u2014 There are two quartz-crushing ma chines at work and one idle. There are 61 puddling machines at work, 16 whims, and 75 whips. There are also eight engines, of the aggregate of 83-horse power, and four more in course of erection. A company has been formed, and has jrot up a boring machine 6 inches in diameter and 300 feet long. It is at present intending to prove the deep ground on the Cniltern Lead. Mining matters in this district remain almost with out alteration since the date of my last report. So far as the main Indigo Lead is concerned no additional shafts have been bottomel on the course of the lead, and the presumed junction of the Devonshire and Caledonian Leads with it has not yet been defined. The upper portion of the lead continues to be worked by the Chinese, who are apparently getting very good SANDHURST MINING DISTRICT. No. 1, or Kangaroo Flat Division. (Edward T.

Many other shaft0 have been bottomed, but nit on the lead. To judge from the number of unsuccessful holes this lead will evidently prove very narrow and patchy. Caledonian Lead.\u2014 From reports I am led to believe that this lead is not yielding anything like fair wages to the miners employed upon it. I should, perhaps, except a few claims, the holders of which appear to be satisfied with their earnings. This lead is very patchy. Durham Lend. \u2014 This lead continues as good as formerly reported, so far as the shafts have been bot tomed on the lead, which, owing to the great width of the flat, is very difficult to define. In some instances, as much as 15dwt. to the oil-can have been prospected, with two feet of wash-dirt. The sinking ranges from 135 feet to 205 feet. The one last bottomed is on the The estimated population Is as followB :\u2014 Alluvial miners 4,143 Quartz miners 803 6,036 Of these, 3,706 are Europeans, and 1,330 Chinese. There are 256 puddling-mills at work, and 71 idle ; and there are 19 steam-engines, of the aggregate of 323-horse power. Alluvial digging is being carried on very briskly at present, auriferous ground is becoming very scarce, and tne gullies and flats are being gradually worked out. The majority of the puddling-mills are at work, but there is a great scarcity of water. Alluvial diggings at Bendigo will shortly cease to be occupied by the individual miner, as all the gillies are entirely excavated from side to side, with the excep tion of a few sludge receptacles which could not be worked by the puddlers. Reefing at present is ral her dull, and some of the lines of leads appear entirely abandoned, owing to the number of claims which have been purchase 1 from the working miners by public companies. These have not yet staned to work with any vigour. Alluvial mining is less permanent than quartz mining, ar.d puddling-mills are constantly changing hands. Hundreds of them have been purchased by public companies, which throws a yreat number of men out of employment, causing the puddler to be migra' ory. The quartz-miners in their claims have work for years before them, with the support of the merchants. &c. The Glasgow Reef is almost at a stand-still, except- dip, and is throughout perfectly dry.

Dott and Co., on the Wellington Reef\u2014 a continuation of the Glasgow line \u2014 have been getting out some very rich stone at a depth of 70 feet. Their last crushing turned oul about 12oz. per ton, and several other claims about here are getting out very good stone. The Glasgow Gully Company have struck upon the western limb of the reef, about six feet from the sur face, and are now taking up very rich stone It is ex pected to yield about 4oz. per ton. To the north and south of this is situated the ground of the United Glasgow Reef Mines Company\u2014 in all, about 400 yards along the reef. There has been a great quantity of work done here, allabove the water-level, exceptingin one claim, where a quantity of rich stone was ob tained. This company are waiting for their engine, when the work will be carried on vigorously. The Glasgow Reef is a well-defined line, running regularly through every claim, more or less rich, but very patchy above the water-level; and there are about 30 claims anxiously waiting for tae completion of the pumping-engine, which will be at work by February. Stafford Reef.\u2014 This line is but partially worked. Many of the claimholders are too poor to continue working long at a time. There are only three claims in which gold has been struck. One claim, called the German's, has plenty of stone, with a yield of about lOoz. to the tou. The bearing of this reef changes so suddenly that it is very difficult for the miners to follow up the lead. Sarnia Reef.\u2014 The majority of the claims on this reef have been bought up by the Sarnia Reef Com pany, now in course of formation. Hundreds of miners in this ocality are anxiously waiting the result of the opening out of these mines. The centre claim of the company (Guss and Co.) has had another crushing, ai*d the result was 6oz. to the ton. Sheephead'a Reef. \u2014 Themost southerly claims on this lead are getting stone 70 feet down, yielding l\u00a3oz. to the ton. Bird's Reef.\u2014 Mining is carried on briskly on this lead. There are about 20 claims, all extracting rich quartz, yielding an average of 2oz. to the ton from the surface reef. Le Capelaine's Company, on this line, have completed one of their engines, and the other will be commenced directly. They are getting out a large quantity of payable stone, carrying away entirely the top reef before them. Thistle Reef.\u2014 There are three claims which have struck the reef on this lead, at a depth of 40 feet, yielding on an average lOoz. to the ton. This is a well defined lead, underlying to the eastward about 1\u00a3 foot to 1 foot, keeping an uniform thickness of 14 inches. It is expected to lead to the reef at 10d feet from the Burface. Break o' Day. \u2014 Little has been done on this line since my last report. Several claims have been taken up along the lead, and have been sunk. Snecimen Hill, Tin Pot. \u2014This company are stacking larg'e kilns of stone obtained from the surface, some of which have been crushed, averaging 4oz. per ton. Many other claims are getting similar stone, wliich pays them well. There are many claims yielding gold\u2014 quite isolated \u2014bearing names for themselves, but which, when traced out, are found to belong to one or other of the main leads. There are seventeen quartz crushing machines of the aggregate of 242-horse power, using 226 stampers, aud crushing 338 tons per 24 hours ; also 166 puddling machines, several of which are not working. There are 16 horse whims at work. The most noticeable features during the last month have been the spirit which recent successes in quartz mining have infused into prospecting, and the rapidly diminishing water supply ot tne puddlers. The latier has to a certain extent interfered with the operations of the puddlers, and caused a diminished gold produc tion. The impetus which I allude to as having been given to prospecting in quartz resulted from payable stone having been struck on several reefs, of which Wilson's and Welsh's are two instances. Stone taken from the former yielded an ounce and a half to the ton. Many r<aefs iu my district remain unworked, the stone not being of sufficient richness to pay for cartage in addition to crushing and other expenses. The Victoria Reef is being worked wiih greitly increased energy, inconsequence of the success which has attended Mr. M'DougaU's undertaking to drain the reef. His pumping shaft is now sunk, to a depth of 280 feet, and has effectually drained the water from the neighbouring claims, and in consequence all the crushing-mills in the viciuity are in full work. On the Eastern Victoria Reef, a spar 20 inches in thickness has been struck in the claim of the Spec Hill Company. It was at 10 feet from the surface, and has yielded 2oz. 12dwt. to the ton. Stone yield ing 13dwt. to the ton has been raised from the cliim ol the Albert Company, ou the White Lead, who have sunk a shaft 140 feet deep, between the Victoria and the Eastern Victoria Reefs. On reaching this depth, they put in a drive to the eastwa d, aud struck the reef. Messrs. Ballerstadt and Sou nave struck the same reef at a depth of 160 feet. Two claims of Messrs. Burrows and Hudson, on the southern line of the Victoria Reef, have long been famous for then richness, and still continue to give handsome returns. The line of the Victoria Reef differs from others iu this respect, that it is more regularly formed, and that gold has been found throughout the whole of it ; and, in consequence, six miles have either been taken up, or applications have been lodged for leasing it. It will be necessary to erect more pumping machinery. Paddy's Gully Keef is in the same quiescent state as alluded to in my last report, but as the attempt to work it by means of a company has been finally aban doned, the claim-holders will probably now again commence work. One claim parallel with this line is working east of the New-Chuui Reef, and is probably on the continuation of the Alfred Reef. bteps are being taken for the erection of powerful machinery for draining the New-Chum Keef, which has been at a stand-still lor some time. The operations of the crushing-mills in Ihe vicinity of Cape Clear, at the head of Long Gully, have been suspended from a deficiency of water. Work pro gresses, nevertheless, and the stone raised is being stacked. A shaft has been sunk about five claims from the prospecting claim of the Great Western Company, Cape Clear. A depth of 170 feet has been attained, but no reef has been found as yet. Eagle Hawk Division. (G. W. Hart, Mining Surveyor.) I have the honour to lay before the Board of Science a description and plans of the Wallace Reef. The reef is situate about six miles from Sandhurst, and may ue considered, perhaps, the most extensive of the de tached reefs now being worked, of which, as I have before remarked, there are several in this division. The Wallace Reef has now been opened about three years, and has been more or less worked during the whole time. , [Here follows a minute description of the workings on the reef, the underlay of the veins, &c] The portion of the reef that I have been able examine bears N. 11 dcg. 30 min.

Note.\u2014 The population in each place is taken ac curately. The number of tons crushed, and the weight of gold yielded, were obtained from the books at the crushing machines. A very considerable progress in mining has been made in this locality since my last report. Many of the puddling-machines are passing from the hai.dg ofthe Europeans to the Chinese, in consequence of the desire of most of the former to enter into reefing, arising from the general success of those so engaged. There are comparatively few persons employed on most of the reefs, and they are mostly employed in sinking shafts. The few instances where a depth sufficient to strike the main reef has been attained account for the small quantity of auriferous quartz raised, but the number of tons crushed would havo been much higher for the month were it not that the crushing- machines were idle for some days, under going repairs. At present a large quantity of stone is prepared, and only awaits the convenience of thc crushers. From one claim on Balaclava (Lamb and Pittman's) 24oz. have been obtained from 23 tons of stone, and from another (Morgan's) on the Albert Reef 14 tons have yielded 192oz. A good many of the puddling-machines resumed working after the dams received a supply of water from the late rains.

It is now nearly abandoned, only two men being employed on it.

Latterly the alluvial workings have not been so re munerative as they were even a year ago, and the want of water is beginning to be extensively felt. Powerful machinery, system, and capital, however, now about beingapplied to alluvial mining, may effect a change. Quartz-mining seems more promising, and has almost invariably been found payable whenever it was properly prospected. Notwithstanding ihe partial want of water, the condition of the mines is prosperous ; and the general progress of mining is, in a practical point of view, uearlv as active and advancing as when about three months ago the rush for leasts was at its height.

I estimate the total population of the divi sion at 16,000. A large rush has taken place in a portion of my district four miles in a south-east direction from the south-east boundary of the Avoca township. The diggings are called the Lamplough, in consequence of being near what was formerly termed the Lamp lough Home Station, and are situate on the Middle Creek, which is a continuation of Rutherford's Creek, a tributary of the Avoca River. The rush was occasioned by a party of prospectors, who struck payable gold in 12 feet sinking. That party for some time past have been prospecting in various parts of the same flat, leading from Avoca township. I beg to transmit a plan of the situation of these workings, with vertical sections of the sink ing, together with a plan of the streets, which under the Warden's instructions, and in accordance with mining regulations, Class H, I have surveyed and laid out for business purposes only. [Here follows a description of the survey.] The vertical sections show the character of the sinking, which differs materially in a short distance, the bed-rock being principally mica schist, with occa sional sandstone bars. The lead commences at nearly surfacing on the north-east side of the flat, and crosses the Lexton road and watercourse in a south- There are 240 puddling-machines, 160 of which are at work and 80 idle. The new Avoca Rush, called Lamplough, having during this month created much sensation, and at the commencement offered great inducement, those diggers who have not been steadily employed have been thinned ; but the reduction would seem to be of short duration, for daily parties may be seen returning to their old quarters.

The gold appears to cling mostly to the opposite low ranges from wher ever it commence-, and the miners seem to have lost the payable ground as the sinking got deeper, but at that point the flat widens very considerably, and my opinion is that the lead will be found trending more to the south-west than they are at present working, or rather \"shepherding.\" Payable ground, from six to eight chains wide and three quarters of a mile in length, has been found, and I am convinced, by persevering, that a lead of gold, leading from this to the Avuca, will eventually be found. Cockatoo.\u2014 Here another frontage lead is proclaimed at the request of the miners, who seem unwilling to attack the deep and wet sinking on the hill without the protection afforded by the frontage regulations. Quartz-Mining.\u2014 Two new reefs have been dis covered. One, a supposed continuation of the Ma riners', 14 chains from the south boundary line of Messrs. King, Harding, and Co.'s claim. The pros pectors found auriferous quartz from the surface to a depth of 30 feet, yielding 3oz. per ton. The other is situated 60 chains south-east from Mariners'. The auriferous lode at the surface is 3 inches in thickness, and dips nearly perpendicularly. As far as it is traced it becomes wider, with richer-looking quartz. Section 3 is the prospectors' claim. Several other contiguous claims with this have yielded from a few pennyweights to 5oz. to the tub.

In alluvial mining nothing has been done, except by about 12 miners. Kingower.\u2014 The Union Reef is still in full work, also tre several claims on the Bonaccord Reef. The Amalgamated Company are still procuring a large quantity of quartz, some of which is highly auriferous. Very few miners are engaged in alluvial mining, all being greatly interested by the discovery of a new gold-field near here, which is attracting everyone wbo can possibly get there. It has been named lnglewood, in honour of the prospectors^Messrs. Thomson and Co. They went out several months ago for the purpose of prospecting, and about four weeks since made known the discovery of payable gold. Several other parties then went, but the great scarcity of water prevented a few from remaining, there being only a few tons of water procurable at a distance of 2 miles. Since my last report a decrease has taken place in the population of this division, both of alluvial and quartz miners, but chiefly of the former, in conse quence of a rush to Hall's Diggings, near Kingower, and numbers are preparing to leave from all parts of this division. I have no improvement to report in alluvial mining, and, with the exception of the Po verty Eeef Company, note of the mining companies have commenced operations. Quartz-mining is increasing daily. Three new reefs have been opened during the month. The chief in crease is in the Sandy Creek portion of this division, between the Loddon and a line drawn north and Bouth through the western boundary of the town of Tarnagulla. The quartz in this space is generally of a different character from that to the westward, being more porous and granular. At Sandy Creek the various auriferous reefs are being worked with their usual energy ai.d success. The Hellas Reef, which yielded 9\u00a3nz. per ton last month, has yielded 25oz. per ton this month. The Corfu, which I reported last month as yielding about 4oz. per ton, has not fallen off in produce. There are two veins, or lodes, of quartz in this minr, divided longitudinally and vertically by a thin seam of blue slate. The western vein is exceedingly rich, con tinuing to give from 18oz. to 20oz. per ton ; the eastern, from 2oz. to 5oz. None of the shafts north and south of the prospec tors' claim on the Corfu have struck the reef, although down a considerable depth. On the north end of Poverty Reef, Messrs. Begnon and Company's engine has commenced baling in a shaft over 3u0 feet deep in their amalgamated claim, and there is every proba-. bility of striking a continuation ot this great reef as sooa as the water is lowered sufficiently to allow of operations underground. The population, however, has been steadily increas ing ever since, and now numbers about 3,000, aud is daily being augmented. Three prospecting claims for quartz mining have been granted, and also several for alluvial mining. The quartz specimens procured (in all cases from the surface) are first-class. The alluvial ground opened h<ts been fuund highly auriferous in some instances, aud already pavable gold has been fuund in seve ral gullies miles apart. The excitement always attending a new rush mtkes it difficult to ob tain accurate information, therefore I cannot tay as to the yield of gold further than that I believe it is in general satisfactory, and I have no hesitation in say ing this will become a very larg ; and important gold field, both for quartz at,d alluvial mining. It is at present chiefly confined to the mallee scrub, through out which the gullies are generally very shallow, and At Cay's Specimen Reef has turned out stone of rich quality from a leader in the prospectors' jlaim, and great hope is entertained of striking a perma nently rich reef. On most of the reefs here, as well a**- in other parts of this division, many of the claims not actually getting aold are being registered for three months*, so that the proprietors may have an opportunity of going to the Kingower rush.

The bed rock is exposed and washed bare on most of them. A track is now cut through the scrub to the Loddon River, where the washing-stuff has to be carted, and from which water for domestic use is brought, and sold at 6d. per bucket on the diggings. For about a fort night, water was procured from several water- holes, distant about three or four miles ; but the supply was only small, and consequently soon used. I have the honour to forward another plan of Forest Creek, which when joined to No. 3 will show the eastern boundary of the auriferous deposits and the original source or commencement of the Forest Creek Diggings. The plan includes the who'e of Golden Point, in the parishes of Chewton and Faraday, and that has many interesting associations connected with it. The point A on plan of Golden Point was the scene of the first diggings, early iu October, 1851. By the first week m November, about 60 men were fossicking with spades, half shears, picks, and tin dishes. The sinkings were in the creek, through 3 feet of rich black soil, and from the richer deposits were obtained 20oz. to 30oz. to the square foot superficial. I send a tracing, showing the position of this field. As many of the miners come here unprovided with tools, mates, &c, there has not been much digging done. At present the only drawback appears to be scarcity of water, and consequently a large population could not be supported until a supply of water is ob tained. The second point of the gold discovery was at the bend of the creek, Montgomery-hill, Plan 1 ; and by January, 1852, the whole of the ground included in the four sections had been prospected aod in working. By the plan now sent, as also by the general plan of the division previously sent, the source of the allu vial deposits is easily traceable to the quartz reefs on the west of the main workings. The alluvial diggings begin at the Nimrod aud Diamond Reefs, head of Golden Gully, and the other gullies from the con tinuation of these reefs. The richest pockets were found in the water-courses and at narrow bends or junctions of the creeks. The plan shows the leases of quartz reefs applied for in the immediate neighbourhood of Golden Point grants under the Mining Board by-laws, and ordinary claims. Although the ground has been constantly worked for eight years, there are at present profitably employed in alluvial mining 123 Euiopeans and 882 Chinese, and in quartz mining 161. The gullies to the south and east of Golden Point, especially where they have an east and west direction, present auriferous indications. Owing to the majority of the miners within this division being quite unsettled this month, I cannot give you the number on each gold-field with any accuracy. | Mr. District Surveyor Urquhart, who has. visited ' Inglewood, to lay off the site of a township, says, in a letter addressed to the Surveyor-General\u2014 \"I have seen some samples of thc gold obtained from and near the surface, and am of opinion that, when well tested, it will prove an extensive and permanent gold-field.\" He speaks of the \"total want of water on the ground, \"j CASTLEMAINE MINING DISTRICT.

The Tunnel rush in Glengower, Deep Creek, is pro gressing, and it is rumoured that two or three tunnels have lately broken through and blruck gold, but I can not vouch for the truth of the report. In the mining population no visible change has oc curred during the month. As near as I can form an estimate, it remains the same as for October, viz. : \u2014 In alluvial sinking matters seem this season to be more lively than last summer. About new Nuggetty Gully, Yandoit, a large number of miners are at work, and I have been shown splendid samples of gold got there. About three weeks ago it was rumoured that a nugget of 28 pounds had been discovered, but I have not heard the report authenticated. Boots' Bald Hill and vicinity seem also to be in great favour, and in Elliger's Gully more people are at pre sent employed than when the gully was first opened.

Mr. Wilson's crushing machine, having undergone thorough repairs, has only lately resumed operations, and U pronounced to work admirably. On Collier's Reef, Wombat Hill, Messrs. Winther and Company are now and again reported to have got some first-rate stone ; and on Wembat Reef, the parties at work are getting well paid, although no extraordinary yields have come to my knowledge. On Connell's Reef, Messrs. Villard, the only party working, are doing well, woiking the ground systematically. The total mining population is 92o, and of these 139 are Chinese. Machinery. \u2014 There are four quartz-crushing ma chines at work and two idle. There are seven puddling machine at work, and four idle. A new vein, called the Nuggetty Reef, was lately discovered, running nearly parallel to and about 40 yards west of Connell's Reef. At a depth of 40 feet the reef has a width of 3 inches, and the yield was6oz. per ton. Claims on this fine were, therefore, eagerly sought for. As regards mining operations in that part of the St. Andrew's mining divinon known as the Caledonian Gold-field, nothing worth reporting has occurred during the past month. At Anderson's Creek a new quartz vein has been discovered, and is called Gardiner's Reef ; as to the yield, nothing is known as yet. The reef is about six inches thick, and has a dip of about 90 degrees. This vein intersects Thompson's Gully, and has probably contributed to the richness of some of the patches of alluvial gold which were found there some time ago. The workings at this quartz vein are in a very soft argillite, with occasional seams of hard grey shale. Puddling and sluicing are fairly at a stand-still, on account of the total absence of water in our creeks. During the summer probably new ground will be prospected, as a great number of our puddlers and sluicers are removing towards the outskirts of the divi sion. It is surprising that in a division where the want of water during the summer is so severely felt, and where hundreds, and I may say thousands, of pounds are expended on extensive races, no steps are being taken to insure a supply for the summer. The nature of our watershed offers every facility for the construction, at comparatively little cost, of lakes or reservoirs. The Yarra Yarra Gold Mining Company are getting on very rapidly with their works at Thompson's Bend. They have now 58 men employed in making the cut, through which the river wdl be turned pro bably in a month from this date. Tunnelling has not undergone any visible change by the setting in of dry weather. The stuff is being stacked for next winter, most of the tunnels affording enough water to prospect the stuff before stacking and to wash off the best stuff to support the party. Tun nelling may be considered, for steadiness of yield, and for the length of time it afforde profitable employment, as one of our ch'ef resources, although in some in stances a very considerable outlay of capital and labour is required before payable gold is obtained. The Company to whom I alluded in my last report as having been formed for the purpose of working that part of the river called the Pound Bend, have applied for a lease of two acres three roods and four teen perches of land, through which to make their tunnel. The purpose of this tunnel is to turn the river through it, and by that means, with the aid of pumping machinery, to draw the whole of the river from A to B (see sketch).

The mining population is as follows :\u2014 Quartz-Reefs. \u2014 The Township Quartz-Reef Company has at length got its crushing apparatus fairly started. It works admirably, and is generally admitted to be amongst the best-arranged and best-fitted machines iu the colony. Up to the present time the result of the crushing operations has been 12dwt. to the ton, and there is every reason to believe the claim will prove to be a very valuable one. The company holding the adjoining claim is endeavouring, by means of in creasing the number of shareholders, to raise suffi cient funds to enable it to purchase the necessary machinery for working the claim efficiently. I find that to the westward of the bed of the Inkermann Lead there is a great number of quartz reefs cropping out at various intervals above the surface. These reefs, though they have the appearance of being auriferous, have not yet been tested. The fact of their not having been pros pected must, I presume, be attributed to the want of the necessary capital amongst the miners ; how ever, I have no doubt that they v. ill, sooner or later, not only be tested, but be found to be sufficiently auriferous to pay for mining.

[Mr. Cowan states that 69 ofthe horse puddling-ma chines and 19 whims are idle.] The results that are now being obtained from the working of comparatively poor quartz on this gold field indicate that there is a large field of industry which may be said to be, as yet, almost undeveloped. So far as the quartz lodes in my district have yet been worked, there appears to be no reason to suppose that the yield will decrease aa the depth increases. During the last month some results have been ob tained, which serve to show that there is a positive increase in the yield of gold as greater depths are attained. A short time since, the Old Post Office Hill Company obtained some very lar_e dividends, and are quite confident that the quartz in their claim will pay os well as formerly, though taken from a greater depth. During the last month this company have struck a run of quartz yielding loz. lOdwt. to the ton, at a depth of 117 feet, and have obtained dividends amounting to \u00a360 per man per week. The quartz both above and below this run bas been found to keep up the usual average, viz., 8dwt. to the ton ; but the fact of such good quartz having been struck at so great a depth would serve to show that other runs of equal richness may be expected at a still greater dis tance from the surface. An improvement in the yield of quartz in my dis trict has been shown by the operations now carried on by the Last Chance Company. This company have struck a run of quartz at a depth of 70 feet, which has yielded a return of 15dwt. to the ton, and a dividend has been obtained of \u00a314 per man for one week's work. The results have, as a consequnce, given a greater impetus to quartz mining, which is now regarded as likely to become one ofthe chief employments in this district. As an instance of the confidence derived from a pro longed experience in quartz-mining in this district, I may mention tbe operations carried on by Tredennick and party on Golden Point. This company commenced crushing in March, 1857, and up to the present time have crushed about 8,000 tons of quartz. This has been done with machinery of a very imperfect descrip tion, and the quartz ha-s been taken from a claim that has always been considered extremely poor. The results obtained, however, have been sufficient to induce the party to erect a new and powerful battery of Btamps, with which no doubt they will obtain far better returns than hitherto.

Black Hill.\u2014 The same energy is still apparent in quartz-mining on the Black Hill; and the majority of the miners have no cause to complain of the amount of their weekly receipts. I cannot report so favour- ably of the alluvial workings in this vicinity. Little Bendigo.\u2014 The scarcity of water here is felt to a great degree, and although the locality affords many favourable sites for the construction of large resf-rvoirs in which the winter floods might be pre- served, little advantage has been taken of the oppor- tunities presented. This neglect is much to bt re- gretted, as were the proper precautions to be taken, a supply of water would be secured which would enable almost every company in Little Bendigo and vicinity to work during the summer months. There is no per- manent creek in this part of the district, and the miners have to depend on the winter rains for their supply, and though the waters of the creeks and swamps of Bullarook could be easily conducted thither, no sufficient means have been adopted to ac- complish this desirable undertaking. [Mr. Fitzpatrick states that nearly all the quartz- crushing and puddling-machines in this locality are compelled to stand idle awaiting a supply of water.] Dead-Horse Gully. \u2014 In this locality little or nothing in the way of alluvial mining is being done. Such of the miners as worked puddling-machines duriner the winter are now content to eke out a subsistence by fossicking in the old ground. Prospecting for quartz is carried on to a greater ex- tent than heretofore on Dead- Horse Gully ; and as the All Nations Company have Btruck a reef of nine feet, and have seen gold in the various workings, the attention of the miners is now more directed to this neighbourhood. This company's claim is situated about one and a half miles north of the Monte Christo Company's claim, and on the same reef. Springs.\u2014 I can report nothing favourable of the Springs this month, other than the many advantages they afford of securing a large supply of water, which advantages have been neglected to as great an extent as in any other part of the district.

These gullies were opened about four years Bince, and thoroughly wrought out according to the system then in vogue, but latterly it has been found, that in consequence of the very hurried and ill ordered manner of mining or digging at that period carried od, one half of the gold was not in the first instance obtained ; in proof of which I may mention that three or four small partiei have been getting this time back as high as from \u00a38 to \u00a310 per man per week from one of these gullies (Hockey's) that had been the scene of two or three successive rushes and abandonments since 1856. The gully is rather wide and flat, and bounded by regular slopes on either side, and contains gold to a width of 70 or 80 feet. In many cases the richest de posits have been found upon the sides or verges. The other gully (Jackson's), though originally con sidered rich, appears to me more \" patchy,\" and therefore up to the present has not received such at tention as its still undiscovered treasures would amply repay. Frenchman's and White Horse Leads. \u2014 All the companies on these leads are still battling their way with rock and water, the struggle being now of nearly four years' duration, yet there is no telling where, or how soon, the gutter will be reached. Cobbler's Lead.\u2014 There are now only two companies in the occupation of this lead. The Long Tunnel Company will be shortly worked out, and, I believe, had their claim been anything like the size or extent allowed by the present regulations, a very handsome return would have been obtained, even though the sinking of the shaft occupied upwards of two years. The other company, the Prince of Wales, I under stand, have just struck the gutter, at a depth of about 330 feet, having been 3 years engaged in putting down their shaft. They are now, however, likely to get well remunerated, as they have a very large extent of ground, as much, indeed, as will not be wrought out four or five years hence. The Staffordshire Reef is still on an improving scale. Nearly all the claims in occupation give good returns, and each succeeding week tends to confirm the occu pants in the opinion that the reef, though quietly worked, is one of the most remunerative in the colony. Within the past month some very excellent stone has beenraised from Nos. 4 and 5 north, a portion of which, crushed at the Prospectors' Machine, yielded IJoz. per ton. This ground was abandoned fora considerable time, and has been in the possession of the present share holders only a few weeks. Mount Misery Creek.\u2014 The influx of Chinese to this locality is still considerable. The flat on either side of the bed of the creek, together with the creek itself, is for fully two miles completely occupied by them ; but of their doings I cannot give any information, as they are in the habit of carrying out their mining transac tions without availing themselves of the surveyor.

In the beginning of the month a shallow lead was discovered on the Scotchman's Flat, running in a north-westerly direction towards the Scotchman's Lead, and situate 50 chains west from the south-west corner of Buninyong Township. The depth of sink ing is from 18 feet to 26 feet through a stiff clay. An average of about 2 feet of wash-dirt has been obtained, containing gold to the amount of 2\u00a3oz. to the cubic yard, but in several instances a much greater yield has been obtained. Out of the shaft marked \"4,\" I am informed that three men divided \u00a3100 for one week's work per man. Underlying the wash-dirt, in the deepesfportion of the run, is a pipeclay bottom, but at the sides where the wash-dirt ceases the bottom is generally a rotten grey slate. For particulars as to the fall and probable course I beg to refer you to the accompanying plan and section. The portion of the Scotchman's Lead in the unsold lands has all been previously worked, but, as will be seen on the plan, two companies are now mining on the abandoned ground. The Imperial Company has not yet bottomed, but Taylor's Company has been getting about \u00a3oz. to the cubic yard. All the re maining portion of the Scotchman's Lead at present occupied being in private property, with the excep tion of the positions ot the ground occupied by the different companies and shafts, I cannot obtain the information available in Crown lands. The greatest portion of private property, as shown on plan, was formerly the pre-emptive right of Messrs. Learmonth, but has been purchased by the Buninyong Gold-Mining Company. Through this property it is apparent that the Scotchman's, Devonshire, aud Union Jack Leads must have their course. The Crown lands portion of the Devonshire Lead was partially worked and abandoned about three 3'ears since, and is now again occupied, by four companies. The Independent Company is the only one at present getting gold, and I am informed that their average yield has been about 8dwt to the cubic yard. Nothing of remarkable in terest on the deep leads has occurred during the past month. The Telegraph Cjmpany on the Durham have not been obtaining such a profitable yield as re ported in my last ; and from the course of the leads they are beginning to suBpect that they are not yet in the Durham gutter. Surfacing companies are almost entirely idle, and unless a considerable rain-fall takes place shortly the shallow miners will be unoccupied. Owing to this and the difficulties to be contended with on the deep leads the mining population, as the tables show, is gradually decreasing. No. 6 Division. (John Lynch, Mining Surveyor.)

The Grand Junction, which is the lowest of the block claims, has bottomed at a depth of 90 feet, and struck gold. The other block claims, between this and the frontage portion of the Standard, are actively prosecuting their labours. At Carngham very little has occurred within the month that requires especial reference, with the ex ception of the Gnome and Magnum Bonum Com. panies, who have bottomed their respective shafts. [Mr. Lynch has sent a fine collection of minerals, sulphuret of iron, &c, from the auriferous drift of the Central Company's claim at Carngham.] The Smythesdale Company, working a lease at the northern extremity of the district, have suffered a delay in proving their ground, which has arisen from a mishap to the Bhaft. This is much to be regretted, as several unsuccessful attempts have been heretofore made to try this ground. The El Dorado claim, abandoned by its first occu- piers, has been taken up by another party, and is now reported favourably. The Argyle Lead will be soon worked out. It has, upon the whole, fairly compensated for the labour and expense bestowed on it. The Montrose and Edinburgh Gullies may be ac- counted failures. The rush to Budgeon's Flat is turning out well. Several claims have been taken up there and are being worked with energy. The Old Brown's Lead is chiefly in the possession of the Chinese, and, judging from the quantities of wash- dirt they are producing, the treasures of the old Lead are not yet quite exhausted. The Great Britain and North Briton Companies on the North Briton Lead are still successful, dividends of \u00a330 per week per man being of no uncommou oc currence. The Grand Junction and Hand-in-Hand Companies, lower on the lead, are not doing so well. The Newcastle Company are sinking a new shaft to work the shallow end of their claim, the deep and near the Caledonian Company having been worked out.

The general condition and prospects of this division continue good. On the Red Streak all the parties continue to work, and the Crown Company have at length got into the gutter, with an appearance of good washing-stuff. At the Bald Hill Lead a third party (Temple and Compam) have, after driving 100 feet, got to the same gutter as the prospecting party. The yield is, on an average, 7dwt. to the load, with three feet of auriferous dirt. At Long Point in old alluvial ground near the creek, and at a depth of seven feet, a party of two Chinamen got 103oz. in a patch of ground one foot square, the consequence of which is, a large increase of the Chinese in that locality. On Quarry Hill, adjoining the Red Streak, an engine is in course of erection. The Commissioners' Flat, runuing into the Black Lead, is nut yielding bo well as anticipated. Sluicing has been stopped since the beginning ot the month, which is some weeks earlier than usual. There is still sufficient water for the puddling-ma chines. The Cr\u0153sus Company's shalt has attained an unex pected depth, which no longer leaves a doubt of a new lead traversing their claim. On this presumption the Washington and Jupiter block claini3, and the Pendora lease claim have been taken up. The surfacing hills and shallows around Monkey Gully and Brown's are being worked by Chinese. At Moukey Gully deep lead, the Falcon, Havelock, and Prince of Weles Leases are doing well. The City of Durham and Wesley and party have struck black clay in deep ground, which indicates the passage of another lead from Monkey Gully into the leasehold of the Prince of Wales Company. On the frontage portion of the Black Ball Lead nearly all the claims are deserted. Lower down the block claims have more encouraging prospects. The Yorkshire Gully, running into the Monte ChriBto, is in good favour, from the fact of the Black Swan and Blue Jacket Companies having touched on black clay, at a depth which strongly indicates a new lead. There are two or three other large block claims besides the two last-mentioned in the same gully. The prospecting party at Derwent Jack's are doing well. A new gully, known as German Gully, on Jamie* son's ,or Ben Hepburn's Creek, has been opened during the month, It is three miles north by west from Creswick. The depth of the prospecting party's shafcis42 feet, viz., 8 feet of yellow clay, 10 feet of blue honeycomb rock, under which is a stratum of red clay intermixed with sandstone boulders, 14 feet of black clay, below which are 4 feet of auriferous drift or washing stuff. The yield of the washing stuff averages 4dwt. to the load. The bottom is rotten slate rock. At present there Is very little water in a few water* holeB in the bed of the creek. During the winter and spring months, however, there is a plentiful supply, the creek being fed by springs rising at the foot of Spring-hill. In the Clunes portion of my district, the last month has been characterised by considerable activity in the erec'ion of new crushing and quartz mining machinery, and a diminution in the number of companies working the alluvial ground. [Here Mr. Stevenson gives a full description of the workings and machinery of various companies in this portion of his district.] Alluvial Mining. \u2014 The Clunes Co-operative Com pany (Tributer's), on the Northern Hill, are the only parties at present mining, except that a prospectiufE shaft is being sunk by the Nortn Clunes Eureka Com pany. The Homewardbound are washing up. The Clunes Company during the last month washed out The Tunnelling parties at Spring Dallah are pro gressing admirably, and with strong faith in their ultimate success. Several other companies have set in near them during the month, so that very soon a regular unbroken chain of claims will extend from Derwent Jack's through Spring Dallah into Happy Valley and Linton's. Near the old Spring Dallah Diggings there are several claims nearly bottomed. The Rock Hole or Spring Dallah Company's shaft is now nearly 60 feet deep, and is strongly presumed to be on the deep ground. Another gully, called Sawpit, is trending in the direction of the Spriug Dallah Lead, with which it must necessarily join. There are three large blojk claims in operation in this gully, and a lease of 12 acres. The North American Company, near Happy Valley, are about 120 feet deep. They have a powerful engine nearly erected. Adjoining the eastern boundary of this claim a block for 100 men has been taken up. The shallow-workings on Happy Valley and Weston's Hill are still employing a large population. Many of them are doing exceedingly well. There can be no doubt, were there a copious supply of water avail able, magnificent returns would still be obtained from vast areas which are now unproductive.

Is is gratifying that this little g'ves encouraging indi cations of progress\u2014 that joint-stock companies, with proper management, can afford profitable remunera tion for labour, skill, and capital. The Gibraltar Company, whose workings are the deepest on this field, being 330 from the surface, and 170 into the vein, have let the working of the mine by contract. The block of quartz shown on the accom panying tracing has heen let to be mined at 24s. per foot, being half of what it has hitherto cost. In one month 12 men have mined, and with the aid of two men have raised from the shaft to the kilns at the crush ing- machine, and calcined, fit for crushing, 150 tons of quartz. In previous reports I have noticed the fact that in the quartz veins on this field the deposits of the metallic sulphurets become more distinct as they descend under the water level ; as also that the gold become less abundant in the crystalline quartz, and more apparent in the metallic sulphuret deposits. The specimens marked No. 1, from the Gibraltar claim, illustrate this, [Mr. Woolgrove proceeds at some length to describe the various methods of extracting the gold from pyrites, &c.J From time to time, with more or less success, vari ous means have been used on this field by small parties of men to collect the gold in the tailings which have escaped from the crushing mills. This month a more numerous party, with larger means, have commenced operations on the largest mass of tailings yet tried. They have not yet got beyond preliminary arrange ments. This month new ground for an extensive quartz crushing mill has been taken up. The erection of the Steiglitz Company's large engine is steadily proceeding, also the engine-house, tanks, &c. All the pipes for pumping are on the ground. At the northern portion of the ground, in that known as Davis's Claim, two new lodes have been struck. Thirty tons have been crushed from the mixed and broken portion of the leader, where the quartz is soft and irregular, ut the junction of three veins, which yielded 30oz. The lode improves where it is steady and solid, and is from 6 inches to 1 foot 6 inches in thickness. It has been traced for a con siderable distance upwards, showing a large block to be worked out. feet. Messrs.

These works are situated on Bullarook, or Birches', Creek, which has at nearly all seasons of the year a good supply of water. When these works are completed, Clunes will be well supplied with water for mining pur- poses. Gordon Division. (J. B. Cusack, Miniug Surveyor.)

There are only two companies as yet at work on the reefs since the entire area of these reefs was taken up by leases. There are several companies iu progress of formation, and will no doubt commence operations as soon as possible. The KaDgaroo Reef Company are busy, and have already produced some promising dividends, and by examining the ground within their lease, they have discovered two other reefs, which I have reason to believe will prove highly remunerative. Their ground presents indications of numerous reefs running parallel with the original Kangaroo Reef. The other company now at work is the Gordon Parker's Company. They are now working at a depth of 240 feet. This reef is very variable ; in some in stances it is fully 14 feet thick, and in other places not more than 4 inches. The Mount Hope Company, holding the Lone-Star Reef, and the Morris's, Morgan's, and Leviathan Reefs, have their machinery smithed, aud have started about 20 men at work, but as yet they have no crushings. They are deficient of water at the engines, and con sequently they cannot commence extensive operations until the wet weather sets in. Their machinery is very perfect and extensive, and I believe their ground abounds in undeveloped quartz-reefs. All the other portions of the Gordon are in a perfect state of passiveness. Mount Egerton. \u2014 In this portion of the district the mining operations are very dull. The only alluvial workings in the place are now abandoned, with the exception of two claims. - There are four quartz claims at work, but so little has been done this month in these that I cannot report the result of any crushings. The reef, however, is still large, and promises to continue remunerative. [Mr. Woolgrove gives an account of the progress of the workings of the various companies in his divi sion.] The diggings known as Morrison's, on the Moora bool River, are comparatively quiet, owing to the preliminary operations required in fixing appliances for working the claims on a larger and more efficient scale with companies. There is no doubt that a month or two from this time will see these diggings in a very prosperous state. The miners have every natural facility for working the ground well, plents of water, and a large face of wash-dirt. On Dolly's Creek Diggings a great change has taken place for the better. The hill known as Brown's Hill, and the hill north known as Campbell's, are now being worked by a larger body of miners than was ever known to be on this field before. They have already five puddling machines, and applications for other dams have been made. There are several other per sons in the neighbourhood holding prospect claims. The whole of these hills are auriferous in a greater or less degree, and will afford for a long time to come a good return to the miners there. Steiglitz Division.

The Ph\u0153nix and Eureka Companies have suspended mining operations until the arrival of more water. Johnson's Reef has during the month turned out some first-class quartz. The Golden Point Company have obtained 119 Joz. of gold from 89 tons of quartz, or nearly loz. 7dwt. per ton. Blackwood Division. (C. B. Longbottom, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows : \u2014 The Early Bird Company have been very fortunate in striking some very rich quartz, surpassing in rich ness any specimens found in this division since the opening of the Crown claim on Simmons's Reef. \\ have heard parties acquainted with Johnson's Reef on Bendigo assert, that the Early Bird Company's sped mens bear a greater resemblance to those obtained from Johnson's Reef on Bendigo than any they have hitherto seen. The Golden Point Company's machine has been at work for the Early Bird Company, crushing quartz raised prior to their finding the rich specimens alluded to, which yielded lljdwt. per ton, having a reef 10 feet in width, but crushing only 6 feet of it.

In alluvial mining, owing to the scarcity of water, no great progress has been made, all sluicing opera tions being at a stand-still, with the exception of a few parties working in the Main Creek or on the low banks of the creek. During the latter part of the month a nugget, weighing a little more than 6oz., was obtained in Blue Gully, a tributary to Long Gully, together with other smaller nuggets of 5oz. 3dwt. in weight, there being only two small pieces, weighing together from 3 to 4 dwt., the remainder running from 7 or 8 dwt. up to loz. In quartz mining the want of water has also put an end to nearly all crushing, and several quartz miners are busily engaged in alluvial workings. Simmons' Keef is very dull at present, presenting a striking contrast to the noise lately occasioned by the crushing machines, the last at work having suspended operations about the 15th of last month, until the arrival of a more efficient supply of water. The Imperial Company's works are at a standstill. The Crown Company are actively employed in rais ing quartz for next season. The Crown Company calcine the whole of their quartz before submitting it to the stamping process, on account of the stone con taining a large amount of iron pyrites. The company calculate that a larger yield of gold is obtained through the quartz being calcined, and that the gold amalgamates more readily. The Cornish Company are sinking to arrive at the same level the Crown Company are working on. The Simmons' Reef Quartz Mining Company have contracted for sinking their shaft 60 feet deeper, which will give their main shaft a depth of 262 feet. In the bottom level the gold is looking heavier, and the com pany anticipate a satisfactory i esult by sinking a still greater depth. The Victoria Company's works are at present not proceeded with, and I do not anticipate that this com pany will resume operations until the wet season Bets in. During the past year alluvial mining has been very dull, only one rush (Frenchman's Gully) being worthy of note. On the other band, quartz-mining has ad vanced, both with respect to the construction of machinery and method of working. Only one new reef (Johnson's Reef) has been opened during the year. This reef gives every appearance of paying well, and could water be obtained during the summer months in a sufficient qnantity to enable those in possession of water-power crushing machinery to carry on instead of relinquishing mining operations, the benefit would be largely felt by the whole com munity.

Kneebone and Co. were troubled by the flood on the 7th and Sth iDst., which penetrated their work ings, about 60 feet deep, through a fissure in the upper strata caused by the undermining. All hands are at present busy cutting a flood race, on good solid ground, to prevent future casualties ; it is between 200 and 300 yards long. The next claim is O'Neil and Co.'s, who are sinking their shaft at present. They are down 60 feet, and for the last 10 feet they have been sinking through a gold-bearing drift of de composed granite and black sand, which might pay for washing. They expect to bottom at 70 feet, and there is every probability that this claim will pay well. A good lead seems at last to have been struck at Bowman's Forest. To-day the prospecting claim and five others were registered. They state that the depth from the surface to the auriferous drift is 105 feet. The wash-dirt is composed of drift 60 feet wide, from 3 to 5 feet deep, paying \u00a3oz. to the load, and in the gutter, which is 6 feet broad, ldwt. to the'dish. It is situated within a short distance of the old lead, which was aban doned after two miles of its lead had been taken up and registered. Indigo Division. (Thomas E. Thornely, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows : \u2014 For the month of December there is little mining in telligence to report. During the latter part of the month work has been almost generally suspended upon all the leads. Upon the main lead little has been done since the date of my lasj report. A company called the Hit-or-Miss, whose claim is supposed to be situated at the junction of the Durham or Caledonian Lead, have procured steam machinery, the quantity of water rendering it impossible to work the ground profitably without it. Their machinery has been erected and has been working for the past few days, but as yet it has not been found capable of beating the water. Devonshire, Durham, and Caledonian Leads. \u2014 There is nothing to report from these leads, the several junc tions not having yet been defined. Scotchman's and Stanly Leads.\u2014 These leads are all but deserted. Chiltern Lead.\u2014 Since my last report one claim, the Junction Company's, has been bottomed on the lead. It is situated between the Nil Desperandum and the Hope and Perseverance claims. New Ballarat, Stockyard, and Skeleton Leads. \u2014 Nothing on either of these leads calls for particular notice. Italian Lead.\u2014 The amalgamated claim has been bottomed on the level, and the claim-holders report a payable prospect. Rumours of the discovery of new leads have been prevalent during the month, but although prospecting parties are at work in various directions, nothing pay able has yet been Btruck. Quartz Mining.\u2014 There is nothing particular in con nection with quartz reefs or leaders to report. The only crushing-machine\u2014 that of Messrs. Chalmers and Gitchell \u2014 which is being worked has not been half employed, although the quartz which they have crushed has averaged about 2oz. to the ton.

The approximate value of all the mining plant within the divisions is (including tail-races and plant not included in the above schedule) \u00a350,320. There are no new features to be recorded in either division. The scarcity of water is more severely felt in the Nine-Mile division than in the Yackandandah division. At Sandy Creek (in the Yackandandah division) the diggings are situated about eight miles from the \u25a0function with the Mitta Mitta River, and extend from that point about five miles up the creek. There is but a small number of Europeans at work on this creek (between 60 and 70) ; but a great num- ber of the Chinese population, belonging to the Yackandandah division, is centred here. The bed of the creek has been much worked. The banks and surface hills adjoining have been well worked, and in the aggregate have been remunerative, some very rich spots having been discovered ; but in general the ground is very patchy. Four drains have been cut for the purpose of work- ing the surface hills ; but they are all idle, for want of water. The nature of the workings is shallow, seldom exceeding 12 feet, but very heavy, a deposit in some places from 4 to 6 feet deep of heavy gravel, inter- mixed with large boulders, overlying the bed rock. The manner of working the creek is that of stripping paddocks and working nothing but the auriferous deposit, which varies in thickness from 1 to 4 feet. Taking into consideration the great scarcity of water this season, the general prosperity of mining matters must be looked upon as favourable. With respect to our water companies, that on the Nine-Mile, viz., the Ovens Gold-fields Water Company, is at a stand-still pending the completion of the sur- vey, issuing of the contracts, &c. Of that on the Yackandandah, viz., the Pioneer Company, the works are progressing favourably, but owing to the great length of the drain to be cut will not be completed for some time.

Steam-puddling companies supply themselves with water mainly by means of shafts sunk through the quartz to a sufficient depth below the water-level to insure an adequate and constant supply. Many of these veins or leads run through the ground taken up by all our alluvial mining companies, and will, I have no doubt, after the alluvium shall have been worked out, become a source of revenue. Eagle Hawk Division, (G. W. Hart, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 Quartz-mining is steadily progressin /, and per ceptibly approaching a more mature and permanent condition, which is shown by the number of fine powerful steam-engines in course of erection in and around Bendigo, principally for purposes of drainage, without which no dep^i under water level could be attained, and it is at such depths that the wealth of the colony exists.

Approximate value of all mining plant in the divi sion, \u00a343,700 Alluvial mining in this division is in a complete state of stagnation, the want of rain being so severely felt, and should the dry weather continue the inhabi tants of the outlying gullies will be entirely without water, even for domestic purposes. Nearly all the puddling-mills have left off work, and of course the men who were employed at them are iale. The gullies present a most desolate appearance, and will so remain until the rain comes in sufficient quantities to replenish theexhausted dams. Thescene is, however, in some measure enlivened by the proceedings of the steam puddling companies, who are making prepara tionsforthe ensuing season. Noneoftheirworksareyet sufficieHtly advanced to merit a separate description, nor would it be possible, in their present unfinished state, to give a true account of them ; and some months must yet elapse before any of them can be brought into working order. This event is anxiously looked forward to by the more indigent part ef the mining population, in the hopes of getting permanent employment. There are still a few men working with the tub and cradle, making a very precarious living, and I am led to believe that most of them would prefer earning moderate daily wages where there is a certainty than trust to the more uncertain produce of the now almost exhausted gullies and flats. Among the more advanced of the works belonging to the lately formed companies in my division are those of the Eagle Hawk United Steam Puddling Company. I was in hoses that they would have been sufficiently advanced as to have enabled me to lay before the Board of Science a description and plan of their works, in conjunction with the plan of the adjacent gullies, in pursuance of the amended instructions of the 16th of December last. They are, however, unfortunately not bo, and I am compelled to postpone it till next month, when they will have so far progressed as to put me in a position to give every particular concern ing them. I have also the honour to enclose the tabular state ment of population and machinery, as required by the circular of the 14th of December last. The first item (population) has been carefully made out by informa tion collected throughout the division, without refer ence to past reports, and is a very near approximation to the truth. The second (machinery) has also been compiled anew, without reference to past data. Until the machinery, &c, of the various quartz mining companies shall have been completed, and a good supply of water obtained in their dams, very little change will take place, except that each company is employing a large number of miners, extracting and burning immense heaps of quartz, preparatory to the completion of their crushing-mills. These kilns, in many instances, have been tested, sorted, and classi fied, so that they may know what returns to expect from them. In my division there are bix alluvial companies \u2014 two of which are at work, and the rest are in active preparation. [Mr. Harper gives details relative to the progress of the works of the companies.] In my last report I substituted the name of Messrs. Dott for that of Messrs. Fagg and Co., whose claim on the Glasgow Reef (called the Wellington Reef) had turned out rich stone yielding 12oz. to the ton. They have carried the body of stone entirely before them down to the water-level, and they have stopped working to sink a whim-shaft, without which it would be impossible to follow the stone any deeper. Thistle Reef, Dr. O'ConnelFs Claim. \u2014 From this line they are still taking out very rich stone, yielding about 7oz. to the ton. The next claims to the N. and S. have also struck the lead, and are getting out stone equally rich. Sheep's Head.\u2014 The Union Company's claim on this line has lately struck a new body of quartz, which is yielding about 4oz. to the ton. Two or three other claims are getting gold, but not in large quantities. Glasgow Reef. \u2014 The Golden Point Company on this line have commenced in earnest. They have opened out on the surface the entire reef, and are carrying away the whole mass of quartz, which yields on the average about 3oz. to the ton.

Below Cunningham's, or the lower crossing-place, parties are draining the water-holes in the bed of the creek, and with moderate success, which, however, chiefly de- pends on their finding gravel or wash-dirt immediately overlying the bed-rock\u2014 hard clay slate. From the fact of the machinery erected near the township being now at work, this place presents a busy aspect. The principal reefs here continue to maintain their character as being highly auriferous. Many persons have expressed an opinion that the reefs or leaders here are merely surface ones ; but the fact of the lode in these claims increasing both iu thickness and value as it descends, tends strongly to strengthen the opinion that they are main reefs. The amount of gold forwarded from Reedy Creek, by the December escort, was l,500oz. Strath Creek.\u2014 Matters are progressing favourably on this creek. Mr. Sloane's powerful and compact machinery is now in full work. The White Star Reef has yielded a fair return from the crushing, and there is every prospect of the reef being struck on the Ophir. King Parrot Creek.\u2014 On this field the reefs are still looking well, although, from what I can learn, the gold is of a very poor quality, more especially from the claims on the northern end of Whittaker's Reef. At the Junction, mining operations are still being carried on with activity. The reefs at work there are yielding a good average return. A shift has been sunk here for alluvial gold, but without success. Still this ought not to be considered as a fair prospect of the field, as there are many likely-looking flats and gullies that have never been tried. At the Muddy Creek, gold is still being obtained from many of the claims, and I have seen specimens from them equal to any that have come under my notice from other parts of the district. At the Tea-tree Creek the reefs are still showing well, as high as lOoz. per ton having been realised. The quartz- crushing machinery in course of erec tion is being rapidly proceeded with, and will be ready for work by the end of January. Reports have reached me of some few parties doing well in alluvial mining at the Upper Goul burn and the Big River ; but from what I can learn great difficulties have to be encountered, both from the sudden flooding of the river claims, as well as from the difficulty of obtaining stores, provisions, &c. , these having to be packed on horses for about 15 miles before reaching the diggings. mining has become unremuneratlve, and most of the miners have abandoned their claims. There are, how- ever, four applications for leases, and a very general opinion exists, that the reefs would richly repay a judicious application of capital. In the Sandhurst portion of this division also, indi- vidual alluvial mining is declining. The Chinese, who formed a large section of this class of miners, fail to realise subsistence, and a considerable diminution of their numbers is very perceptible. In September and October, 1869, numbers of alluvial miners sought and obtained grants of sites for horse puddling machines and dams. I am aware of several instances in which the grantees have since ceased to work their ground. This might, to a certain extent, be attributable to an insufficient supply of water ; but, viewing it from every point, alluvial individual mining becomes gradually less remunerative, and is declining in this division. The present yield of allu- vial, however, although too minute to compensate the individual miner, is still ample, and more than ade- quate, to the reimbursement of outlay in the judicious application of machinery. The condition of the miners is just now temporarily affected by want of water ; and this want seems to me to be in a great measure caused by the method adopted for the preservation of the water, viz. : \u2014 In a gully, or fiat, where a number of horse-puddling machines are at work in close proximity, each owner has, for his own machine, a reservoir, or dam, generally very shallow, but of considerable superficial extent, thereby presenting the greatest surface for evapora tion. Instead of being so distributed, if all the water were held in one reservoir, sunk to the bed-rock, and properly constructed, the supply would last much longer, and probably not fail at all.

From the circumstance of the very considerable decrease in the number of miners, imperfect provi sions have been made for procuring a water supply, and hence its present scarcity. Alluvial mining is in an unprecedentedly languid state. The nearly total want of enterprise prevailing, the comparative poverty of the mining community preventing the formation of prospecting parties, and the very few instances of machinery or capital being introduced, offer serious obstacles to the progress of the Heathcote Gold-fields. There are a few patches giving a good return to those engaged on them, but in general both puddlers and tub-and- cradle miners obtain a remuneration merely sufficient to provide the ordinary necessaries of life. As there is a large area of abandoned ground in the district sufficiently auriferous to pay a good dividend for the expenditure of capital in the erection of steam puddling machinery, I am of opinion that nothing would be more conducive *,o the prosperity of the dis trict than the establishment of companies, and the in vestments would be attended with undoubted success.

The above return includes all the machinery in the division both at work and idle.) The dulness in mining operations which prevails throughout this division might fairly be attributed to two causes : \u2014 1. The Lamplough and Kingower rushes. 2. The scarcity of water. Diggers have now in the vicinity of Maryborough to pay for water for domestic purposes at the rate of 4s. per cask of 30 gallons, carted from the Deep Creek. Had they a good supply ot water at their command, the diggers are few who could not have realised each successive Saturday a good week's wages. Scarcely a day passes without inquiries being made by the owners of puddling-machines as to the securing of their ground until the rain comes. Quartz Mining. \u2014 This branch of mining seems to have suffered less on account of the neighbouring rushes, and were it not for the desertion of a few un settled miners, who have teen able to secure their claims by registration, no change could be per ceived. On England's hill (Cockatoo) a new reef has been discovered, and in the projectors' claim there are five distinct lodes visible on the surface within The Mysterious and Black Leads are nearly deserted. The Scandinavian and Rocky Flat Leads still con tinue to give fair average yields. A new feature for this locality in the extraction of gold from ihe wash dirt has arisen, viz., that of crushing instead of wash ing. By this process, the very fine gold which is almost imperceptible, and which would be carried off in the sludge, is saved ; and in many cases the additional yield more than covers the cost of crushing. The ex periment of crushing washdirt was tried in conse quence of the miners' attention having been called to the proceeds of quicksilver cradles, when employed washing sludge ; as much as five or six ounces, in some cases, having been obtained daily, by parties of three men each It has been observed that the fine gold alluded to is most plentiful in the neighbourhood of cement Prospecting shafts are going down on the east and west sides of Mount Greenock. There is a considerable thickness of basaltic rock to penetrate. The water races from M Cull urn's Creek have been dry for a considerable time. In the old workings, viz., Star-flat, Hard-hill, Hard hill Flat, White-hill, and Red-hill, very little can now be accomplished without appliances superior to the tub and cradle. They have for a long time been fit to abandon to large companies, who may still find pro fitable employment on them. In Long Gully about 10 miners are at work in the old ground. Nonew ground has been opened here of late. a breadth of 300 yards, running parallel to each other. The surface quartz realises 3oz. per ton. In this reef, as well as in others recently discovered, there is one feature strikingly observable \u2014 viz., that the auriferous veins cropping out on the surface continue favourably to a depth of about 30 feet, and then some are entirely lost for some distance, while others reduce in width or thickness to about 2 inches, and, being traced to from 50 feet to 100 feet, retain this thickness until, in some c*ses, they become connect- ing links with thicker and more important veins than those already discovered. However, in other reefs here the relative positions of the quartz leaders, with respect to depth, appear to be very different. In the engine-shaft (for instance) of Messrs. Costick and Co., White Horse Reef, near Amherst, now sunk to a depth of 230 feet, there are three separate leaders. The middle one, which is the thickest \u2014 10 inches \u2014 runs down nearly perpendicularly, while the other The workings in Nuggetty Gully, Kangaroo Gully, and Kangaroo Flat are confined to the old ground. A few prospecting parties are at work in the division, searching for alluvial deposits. Prospecting for quartz-reefs is being prosecuted with a considerable amount of vigour and with varied success. One has been opened near the Camp Reserve, and from the quantities of gold observable in the stone, remunerative results are anticipated. Another south of the township of AmherEt about 100 yards, is known to exist. It was discovered some time ago by a party working an alluvial claim 30 feet in depth. Application has been made for a lease of five acres four and a half miles W.S.W. of Back Creek. The ground referred to was the site of a rush in June, 1859, known as the Mount Glasgow Rush. The depth of sinking is from 50 to 80 feet. Alluvial miners Quartz miners Total Europeans.

Quartz mining is improving, with the exception of the American, Kangaroo, Cay's, Perseverance, and Bet Bet (rear Dunolly), which are nearly stopped. The reefs throughout the division continue to yield their usual quantity of gold, and several new reefs have been discovered during the month, viz. The Frenchman's, Scotchman's, Tasmanian, and Great Western, all in the neighbourhood of Sandy Creek, and yielding payable prospects. Gold has also been struck on the continuation of Stubbs's Reef to the southward. The Poverty Reef Company have their engine and chimney completed, and intend to com mence winding in their main shaft, which has been sunk to a depth of 170 feet. They expect to reach the auriferous reef at a depth of 250 feet. Owing to the scarcity of water four crushing-machines have been stopped during the latter part of the month. Seventy-four quartz claims, averaging SO feet in leDgth, are registered under one of the district bye laws, which registration permits the shareholders to suspend work and proceed elsewhere. The rush to Inglewo?d has induced this. The mining population is as follows :\u2014 The machinery is as follows ; \u2014 Alluvial mining \u2014 Horse puddling-machines, 71 ; whims, 2. Quartz-mining\u2014 Stea n engines, 4\u2014 34-horse power. The approximate value of all the mining plant in the division is \u00a315,800. In consequence of another rich and payable lead having been discovered at the Lamplough Diggings, the neighbouring gold- workings, with the exception of St. Arnaud and Four-mile Flat, in my division, are almost abandoned by the mining population, those only who apparently are makiDg more than a good living being stationary. Lamplough at present is the grand attraction ; hun dreds of miners are arriving daily from the more re mote gold-fiflds. The yield of gold, together with the large extent of the already proved auriferous ground, indicates that the Lamplough presents every appearance of being the largest rush we have yet had in Victoria. An area of several miles of virgin ground lies be tween this, on the south-west, and the Amphitheatre, in a north-westerly direction, and to where the work ings are at present trending there is a continuation of the same wide flat country, extending in length several miles, and in width from the Avoca River to the base of the Pyrenees ; and now that a large popu lation is in the district, should these diggings be sys tematically worked, several other contiguous small leads, as well as the Avoca Deep Lead, must, at a point not far from the Avoca township, effect a confluence. Korong Division. The original prospectors at the Lamplough still continue to find rich ground. The last washing that I ascertained from their ground was 91b. of gold from five loads of dirt. Further down the same work ing, another claim yielded from some loads ODly a few dwts. ; whilst other loads from the same gave as many ounces, thereby proving the patchy character of the ground. (John Catto, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows :\u2014 The second lead, or workings, which has be*m the principal cause of the present favourable reaction at the Lamplough, is situate upon atributarv of Ruther ford's Creek, having its rise m a belt of ranges, called the Green-hills. For a considerable distance the lead is found to pay 30 claims wide. I have visited some of the underground workings, and find that the miners are only driving around their boundary lines, or what is generally called fencing in their ground. Few are doing anything yet upon this lead, but putting n main drives. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Alluvial Mining.\u2014 Horse puddling-machines, 57.

During the month very little mining has been done in this division, owing to the Inglewmd rush. Al most all the miners from the teveral gold-fields within this division have been irduced to visit this new rush. Many of the miners holding quartz claims with fair prospects of remuneration have had their shares re gistered, to enable them to try their fortunes at Ingle wood, where the prospects are in general satisfactory, notwithstanding the total absence of water. There are now eight gullies and six quartz reefs or veins being worked. All these are not to be considered distinct reefs\u2014 I expect several will be found to be _ The miners inform me that in driving they occa sionally meet with a coarse piece cf gold Collectively they appear lo have confidence in its being a perma nent and payable gold field.

Adjoining each fresh dis covery or prospecting claim, from eight to ten others are generally marked out, and shepherded for a time. The first crushing of quartz from this field took place during the month at Kingower. About two and three quarters tons of quartz Vere crushed, and yielded 13oz. 14dwt. llgr. This was taken from the surface of the Inglewood Reef, and, as many of the richest specimens were not crushed, the yield may be considered very satisfactory. The quantity of quartz yet raised from all the reefs at Inglewood is very small, owing to some of t he ut -t claims being disputed. In the alluvial mining several rich deposits have been found. There are several claims from which wash-dirt yielding from lOoz. to 20oz. per load has been obtained, but these instances are far above the average yield. Twenty-four and a half acres have been surveyed for lease during the month at Korong. Throughout the other parts of the division nothing worthy of note has occurred.

The approximate value of all the mining plant in the division is \u00a375,000. The past month has been one of peculiar incident ; what with the suppression of the mining mania, the apparent quiescence of those companie* who have been formed, by the delay of time in the necessary preliminary operations, erection of machinery, &c, the very lifeless appearance of our diggings, in conse quence of want of water for puddling purposes ; a large proportion of machines lying idle, and many claims being registered; numbers of miners leaving for the various rushes\u2014 as Inglewood, Lamplough' Clare Castle, &c , and yet, with all these our escort returns are vastly increasing. Powerful mechanical resources are being added to our means of disintegra tion, and many of our quartz claims are yielding more promisingly than they have done for some time past. None of our large companies for working alluvium are prosperous. The Chinese are our principal alluvial workers, their indefatigable industry, perseverance, and fru gality, enabling them to work ground, and obtain a livelihood where Europeans, even though aided by efficient machinery, could not succeed. Some of the paddocks excavated by the Chinese are immense, the debris from them being raised into little mountains. Throughout the division the old workings are being thus worked over aud over again, by the simple ap pliances of bucket and pick and shovel. Quartz-mining.\u2014 Inquartz working, although many of the unsuccessful prospectors are registering their claims, yet the returns show a better yield from several of our reefs, which I have every reason to be lieve will still improve. In qoartz-crusbing machinery, we have added dur ing the month, an 8-horse power engine, driving 16 head of stamps, erected on the Sebastopol Reef, at a cost of \u00a31,500 ; a 10-horse power engine, with 8 head of stamps, erected on Forest Creek, in connection with the Dead Cat Reef, Sailors' Gully ; and the Wattle Maldon Division.

Beehive Quartz-mining Association. \u2014 This associa tion has pushed forward its operations with consider able activity. Since the last report the tramway down the incline has been made (?), by which it is intended to draw up the quartz, by means of their engine power. A small shaft has been sunk near the newly made clearing dams, and an eight-inch lift pump put up, for the purpose of raising the water a second time, to be again used before being finally done with. The supply of water at the present tune is greater than before, and is sufficient to supply 12 heads of stampers, which have lately been set to work. The remaining set of 12, making a total of 24, will soon be completed. It is supposed that the main reef will be met with at a depth of 170 feet, at which point a considerable influx of water is anticipated. The Union Eagle Hawk Reef.\u2014 The work at the pump shaft, now down 215 feet, continues uninter ruptedly day and night. When the depth of 230 feet is reached a much better supply of water is antici pated. In the central part of the company's ground a number of men are at work getting some payable stone. The same is the case at the south end. The yield of gold for the month was 305oz. lldwt. 18gr. extracted from 350 tons quartz. The Atlas Association, German Reef. \u2014 The supply of water the company have obtained is increasing, and is found ample. Considerable time has been ex ptnded since the last report in making trials, so as to test thoroughly the efficiency of the crushing machi nery. The result-8 have been generally satisfactory. The time taken for these trials, and the erection of the back-water pump, together with the interruption caused by the holidays, necessarily occupied a consi derable portion of the month ; but, notwithstanding these drawbacks, the receipts for crushing have been \u00a3311 10s. 2d., to which must be added a further sum of \u00a3224 0s. 4d., for pumping charges, making a total of \u00a3535 10s.

Quartz-mining has not, during December, produced anything extraordinary, but although not many of the claims at present in work on an average yield more than loz. or 2oz. per ton, yet the present improved method of working cannot fail to create a very ma terial difference in the net profits.

In reporting the state of mining affairs in this division during the past month, I am happy to be able to state that the results of mining operations generally have been more satisfactory than for some months past, and especially so in alluvial mining, the yield of gold from which has increased fully 30 per cent, from the middle to the end of the month. In puddling and sluicing nothing of interest has occurred. Those puddling-machines which had stored a supply of water from the winter rains are on the average doing very well, but unless some heavy rain sets in shortly, most of them wUl soon be compelled to suspend operations. The upper part of Wombat Creek has long been known to contain gold, but although pretty coarse gold has been found, the quantity has not been such as to induce Europeans to remain long on the ground. Within the last month a large number of Chinamen have taken up their abode in that locality, and I be lieve that Beveral very pretty samples of gold have been obtained by them. As soon as winter sets in the ground will probably be sluiced, and there is every reason to expect that most of the ground will pay very well on being worked on a face. In tunnelling no visible change has taken place during the last month, but the average produce of those through the reef has generally been very satis factory. No new tunnel-ground has been opened, and those tunnels started at Glengower, the lately opened tunnel-ground at Deep Creek, are still working in the reef; but isa properly-defined lead through these places exists, it is confidently expected that within a month or two some of them wUl break through. The want of water is felt in this system of mining, parties being obliged in many instances to stack their stuff till the wet Beason sets in \u2014 only wash ing sufficient of the best stuff to keep them in rations In alluvial mining I have to report the dis covery of a new lead from the head of Kidd's Gully towards the head of Blind Creek (see plan 4a, east)\u2014 a rush, which is considered the best in Jim Crow for the last four or five years, and the produce fully bears out this assertion. The gold was originally discovered on the surface, near the north-west corner of allot ment 50, gradually dipping, so that the last hole bot tomed at b3 feet. The lead is covered by basalt, although not a great deal of rock h?s yet been suijk through. The wash- In quartz mining, besides a steady yield of 4oz. to the ton (average) there have been some successes on a new reef discovered during the pa3t month about half a-mile south of the Nuggetty Reef, on the road be tween Queenstown and Eltham. There are now 868 feetof this reef occupied (including walls),4and through out this length everywhere that the reef has been touched it was found to be highly auriferous. The first sample of 13cwt. of quartz taken from a thin leader on tbe west face of the reef in the prospect claim yielded 14oz. of gold. The main vein, supposed to be more than a foot in thickness, has not been broken down yet, and therefore nothing is known us what it will yield. As to the general conformation of this reef, it is the most contorted I ever saw. In ita strike at the surface of the rock, it runs in a series of curves of contrary flexure ; and as to its dip, which is west where visible, it varies from 35deg. to 90deg , and I believe that in some of the Bouth claims the dip will be found to the east. The general bearing is N. 16deg. E. magnetic. The rock on the west side is a yellowish brown argillaceous sandstone, separating into rubbly fragments and masses, and has the appear ance of having been painted with a bluish white argile. The underlying rock has not been stripped yet, but judging from fragments picked up on the surface it will be a claystone, with veins of ironsione. I must add, with reference to this reef, tfcat it has payable gold in a greater length of it than any other reef yet opened in this division. Gold has been discovered in a gully called Fryer's Gully, commencing at Section IV. in the parish of NiUumbik, and falling into Watson's Creek about a mile above its junction with the Yarra Yarra. Tbii gully is now abandoned, in consequence of the want of water, although it has yielded from 1 to 3 dwt. of gold to the tub, from about three inches of the washing- Alluvial miners Quartz miners Europeans. 2545 179 Chinese. 1060 2724 1060 Europeons.

The depth of washing-stuff averages about three feet, but not more than three or four inches will pay for tub-washing. The depth of sinking is about seven feet from the surface to the rock, namely\u2014 about one foot of soil, three feet of the usual clay, with rounded pebbles of h\u00e6matite, rounded pebbles and fragments of quartz and dif- ferent kinds of sandstones, and three feet of washing- Btuff resting on a hard grey shale. About 30 miners were employed in this gully during the early part of December. About a mile south of Fryer's Gully gold has been discovered at a place called Surveyor's Gully. This gully commences about half a mile from the head of Fryer's Gully, and falls into the Yarra about a mile below Watson's Creek. The sinking in this gully is about eight feet at the prospect claim, and through the same sort of clay as in Fryer's Gully, resting on a hard grey shale ; but unlike any other gully that I know of on the Caledonia Gold-field, or at Anderson s creek, it becomes shallow,to wards its head, and deepens as it approaches the river, The yield of gold in this gully is said to be about 2dwt. to the tub. Ten men have been at work in this gully, but they have left the place at present, from scarcity of water. In Spanish Gully some parties have been doing very well during the month of December. One man found a nugget of gold and quartz weighing 19_-oz., and many rich patches have been met with, from which, besides the usual yield of fine gold pieces, varying in weight from 2dwt. to 3dwt. to 2oz., have been taken. It is to the increased yield from this gully and from that of the Wild Dog Gully, which latter is being worked principally by Chinese, that the increase of 30 per cent, in the yield of alluvial gold on the Caledonia Gold-fieldfiis to be attributed. At Anderson's Creek, Messrs. Moore and Geraghty are progressing very rapidly with their mining ope- rations at the Fourth-bill. They have now tunnelled to a distance of 90 feet, and it is highly probable that they will strike the vein within a further distance of about 30 feet. At Thompson's Bend the works'of the Yarra Yarra Mining Company are fast advancing towards com- pletion. The cut through which the river is to be turned is now nearly completed, as iB also the piling for the dam, which is now completed to about one- third of the distance across the river. Thirty men are employed on these works at present. At the Emerald Gold-field there are only 25 miners, and these speak of leaving the place, not because gold is not to be found in it, but because of the difficulty in obtaining supplies of food. Bakers' bread is not to be had there at any price, and the flour supplied to the miners is so bad, and so full of sand and dirt, that they cannot eat the bread made from it, and therefore have no alternative but to leave the place or starve. With reference to the Britannia Gold-field, I beg to state that, from intelligence received, there are about 200 persons scattered over that part of the country, prospecting and otherwise engaged. I refrain from making further remarks until I visit that place, when I will send in all the required information in my special report, together with as much survey as will fix the posh ion of that gold-field on the general map of the district. I herewith forward a tracing from surveys made of three gullies\u2014 namely, New Watery Gully, Fords Gully, and Stony Creek. ARARAT MINING DISTRICT. Ararat, Pleasant Creek, and Raglan Divisions.

The Koh-i-nor Company is also working at a very great disadvantage in consequence of its main drive, which is about 1,300 feet long, having been entered at too high a level.

Some of the claims have lately paid as much as 2J ounces per ton, and expectations are rife of even better returns. The Ballaarat Quartz Crushing Company are continually employed for the most part crushing their own quaitz, and though the yield is not more than half an ounce per ton. they consider they are very well paid. Within the last month they have paid \u00a31,390 for 130 feet along the course of the reef. Sim and party have erected a steam engine of 20-horse power, with 16 stamps, and having adopted the latest im provements in quartz crushing machinery, are giving general satisfaction. The greater part of the quartz miners on the Black Hill get their quartz crushed by this machinery, and though this company have about 3,000 tons of their own quartz, they have been unable to crush more than one hundred tons up to the present. Many claims have been lately taken up along the course of this reef, and I am positive the claim owners will not regret it. The Ransom Company hold a large claim on these reefs, but though having a very valuable claim both in alluvia] and quartz, have been yet unable to obtain the necessary capital aud machinery to work. Little Bendigo. \u2014 In this locality 56 com panies hold claims ; the greater part of which are compelled to remain idle through want of water. The scarcity of water in this part of the district is equivalent to the loss of about \u00a32,000 per week, as only eight puddling machines are employed. Of this number five are supplied from underground workings, and the others have taken the precaution of supplying themselves by the erection of large and capacious dams. This last resource will soon be of no avail, as the continuance of dry weather will soon deprive them of the winter storage. The Monte Christo Company are busy erecting their quartz machinery, and laying tramways, so that by the approach of winter, they will be enabled to develcpe the riches of this hitherto mismanaged reef. Several quartz claims have been taken up in the neighborhood during the month of January, and from the fact of numerous rich specimens having been obtained there lately, 1 have no doubt that next to the Black Hills this reef will be found to be one of the richest at Ballaarat. for the gutter; however, heavy pieces of gold have been taken out of the reef, and I therefore presume that I shall be in a posi tion to report favorably upon this claim in my next. Quartz Reefs. \u2014 The Township Company is at present engaged in sinking its shaft deeper in order to put in some new levels, so as to be able to employ a larger number of men in obtaining quartz, as at present they cannot obtain sufficient to keep their machinery em ployed. Campbell's Diggings. \u2014 Several of the claims on Sago Hill are yielding very good returns. Two engines are at present being erected, and there is every reason to believe that this will prove a valuable gold field. The want of water is the greatest drawback.

All through the district the want of water is most severely felt, and many parties who in the winter could earn from \u00a310 to \u00a315 per week, are now compelled to seek employment as wages men. The approximate value of all the mining plant within the division is \u00a359,537. I herewith forward sections of Sailor's, We lshed. Terrible, and Scotchman's Leads, with a sketch from plan of district No. 3, and also a table showing the quantity of ma chinery employed in my district. The leads in question were opened some years ago, and are now considered to be nearly worked out. On Scotchman's and Sailor's Leads a number of puddling machines are still at work in the old ground, but the results obtained are barely sufficient to give wages to the men, as a general rule. A company called the Caledonian Com pany, held a large grant of ground upon the lower end of Scotchman's Lead, and have erected some very elaborate machinery for washing the stuff obtained. At this portion of the lead there is a great deal of water to contend with, and, as a consequence, the ground was neglected for a considerable time. In the district of Ballaarat proper the number of puddling machines is not much under 1,000, and taking the smallest average for each machine at 4,000 gallons of water per day of 12 hours, the requisite amount would be equal to 4,000,000 gallons. The supply of water on the mines is, cer tainly, most desirable, and though the expense of this supply would be large at first, yet in a very few years the export duty derived from the increased amount of gold, together with the many other items owing to the greater prevalence of money, would, I am sure, render a good return for the first outlay. By reference to the general plan of the district, it will be seen that all the leads take their rise from the Caledonian Range, whence they have run down into the flat3 on each side. No 3 Division. (Thomas Cowan, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows: \u2014 The whole of the leads were rich in the shallow ground, and Sailor's and Scotchman's continued so until their junction with the main valley known as the Canadian. The Terrible aud Woolshed Leads proved very poor beneath the trap rock on the southern side of the Yarrowee, and have now been abandoned for some time. The progress of quartz mining in my dis trict is still very encouraging, and confidence in this branch of industry is increasing every month. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 In the Canadian Hill two batteries are now in course of erection for the puipose of crushing the quartz obtained from the lodes in that locality. Not long since some very rich specimens were obtained from a vein near Prince Regent's Gully, and there are many indications of the existence of a number of paying lodes in the neigh borhood. On the Gum Tree Flat, Lathlane and party have completed their machinery, and com menced work, but enough quartz has not yet been crushed to enable me to give an estimate of the richness of the lode in their claim. The Enterprise Company, in the same locality, have a very promising lode, and are about to erect a battery of eight stamps. There can be no doubt that this portion of my district will eventually be the scene of ex tensive and numerous quartz crushing opera-. tions. * Excluding two in course of erection Europeans.

It may not be amiss here to state that this company (the Mammoth) was got up a few weeks since by some of the most enterprising and energetic miners in this district, under the provisions of Bye Law X. with a view of working gmund in advance of the Scottish and Cor nish claims that never could or would be taken up by the poor working miners. There are 120 shares in the company, and it is estimated that at least \u00a3100 per share will have to be expended ere the gutter be reached ; and judging from the very en couraging prospects obtained from the next claim, it is not at all improbable that ere the lapse of many weeks the Mammoth will be held by the discriminating speculator, or miner, in as high if not in higher repute than any other claim in the district. It is held in reserve for the present pending the arrangements necessary before active work can be commenced. No. 4 Division. (Michael O'Malley, Mining The mining population is as Surveyor. follows: \u2014 \u2022\u25a0) The machinery is as follows I have the honour to forward herewith a plan of Sawpit Gully, in the vicinity of, and connected by a traverse line with, Hockey's Gully [ plan furnished for the month of December.] During the last month mining matters generally have been rather dull throughout my division, owing, no doubt, to the great scarcity of water experienced in the surfacing and shallow workings during the dry season ; superadded to this, many persons have, of late, been drawn away from this locality by the exciting' accounts received, through the papers and otherwise, from Lamplough, and other \"up-country \" rushes, so that many of the gu'lies that were found to yield tolerably good wages during last winter, are now totally deserted, or if at all occupied they are being worked with little energy by the few remaining parties, for, generally speaking, the poorer class of miners remains when the wealthier or more enterprising moves about from one rush to another. However, it is pretty certain at the approach of next win ter we shall have many of those persons coming back again, and re-occupying most of the old gullies where it is known, under systematic workiug, good wages may be made. Whim Holes.\u2014 Though confidently ex pected at the date of my last report that something de^nite would be known ere this regarding the auriferous nature of this lo cality, still none of the present companies have as yet succeeded in testing thoroughly the place, but from all that may be inferred from indications found a few days ago by the company highest up the Flat it is gene rally believed that a good paying lead will be discovered down the gully by either the Progressive, or Young Eastern Company. The latter company is at present swamped out, and about procuring machinery, while the former expects to get into the gutter in the course of two or three weeks, and thereby satisfy, and once for all set at rest all the doubts, fears, and anxieties entertained during the last ten months regarding the quality, or richness of the Whim Holes Lead. Sawpit Gully. \u2014 This, as well as most of the neighbouring gullies, was formally found to yield very good returns, and even lately the oft turned over soil has in some few in stances handsomely repaid a few parties.

The machinery is as follows Operations on the Staffordshire Quartz Reef are being carried on most spiritedly. During the early part of the month some excellent prospects were washed from some veins struck in Nos. 3 and 4 .North, and since then the development of the various veins in those and the adjoining claims has been prosecuted with unusual briskness. From the Prospecting Claim some hand some results have also been obtained, The southern end of the reef has been in a state of partial abandonment in consequence of the suspension of the Homeward Bound Com pany's works, and now there is every pro bability of this very excellent property being involved in the inextricable meshes of the law; the monthly averages, however, as furnished by W 0. Porter and Co.. are fully equal to those of any of the preceding months Penrose's Reef, Moonlight Flat, still con tinues in a state of quiet. The prospectors meet with good returns ; but their success has not as yet induced others to further test the reef. I have the honor to submit a plan show ing the position of Hiscock's and Rogers' Leads, and the Hiscock's and Cemetery Quartz Reefs. For several months past both leads shown on the plan have been exclusively occupied by Chinese re-working abandoned ground; but at present there are only eight claims at work. From such infoimation as I have been able to gather, these claims have yielded for the second working upon an average from \u00a32 to \u00a33 per man per week, and at the junction of Rogers' and Hiscock's a considerably larger amount was obtained. Mount Misery. \u2014 The Midland Counties Company, on Mount Misery Reef, are work ing vigorously at tbeii dam and machinery site. The dam for strength, extent, and workmanship far and away exceeds anything ol the kind 1 have seen in the country. Tne crushing plant is on the ground in course ot erection, aud altogether the proceedings of the company deserve the highest commen dation. Shafts Nos. 1 and 2 on the Union Jack (Grand Junction Company) are abandoned after au expenditure of over \u00a35,000, on account of the poorness of the wash-dirt, and shaft No. 3 after having been driven over 120 feet is also abandoned, and the machinery removed to shaft No. 4, which has been sunk to a depth of 250 feet, and driven 200 feet, but has not yet broken into the gutter. The Durham Gutter has after a period of more than three years' constant work been struck by the Great Britain Company, and two prospects obtained, one, half-an-ounce to the cubic foot, and another of 4J dwts to a cubic foot. Unfortunately for the company, the drive is not opened out at a sufficient depth for advantageously working the ground, and in consequence, a considerable delay will be occasioned until a deeper level is made. The River Leigh Company, on the Black Lead, has during the month abandoned the claim, and has left a considerable portn n un worked on account of the great expense required to contend against the influx of water. The adjoining company, viz: the Hit or Miss, have taken possession of a portion of the ground abandoned All the other claims previously referred to on this lead are at work. With the exception of a dividend averaging \u00a38 per man per week in the Hit or Miss Company, nothing of con sequence has been done.

The Smythesdale Company, and Darlton Castle Company at the extreme north end of Smythe's have not during the month made much progress, but I believe they are well equipped at last to make an effective trial. I mention these parties because should they prove successful, a vast tract of ground will be immediately opened towards the north of the district. Flat rush, to which I particularly alluded in my last report, and which has been proven lo be\" the best shallow workings opened in this locality for several years. Through this, many hitherto unfortunate miners have realized considerable amounts, and in many instances, I am informed a considerable pro portion of the proceeds here obtained will be expended in further prospecting. By reference to the accompanying tables it will be seen that there is an increase in the quartz mining population ; but as the claims have only lately been taken up there is very little information regarding them worthy of note. The Brunswick Company on the Long Gully Reef, 1 have been informed, out of a trial of ten tons of quartz had an average yield of f oz. per ton, and another trial of fifty tons is being made, out of which a much larger return is expected. The Campbell's Hill Company have wound up their affairs after nearly three years' suc cessful operations on their claim. Some members of the old party, still satisfied that its treasures have not been wholly extracted, have organized a new company, and re possessed it. The Britannia, Perseverance, Pioneer, Hi bernia, Surprise, Great Eastern, and Great Western on Smythesdale Flat, and Warren's Leads are doing well ; the weekly dividends fluctuating between \u00a35 and \u00a310 per man. On the Argyle and Edinburgh Leads the dividends are about the same, and nearly equally circumstanced as regards the pros pects of long employment. Towards the north end of Warren's Lead, and on the North Rritain Lead, and Brown's, the same order of things prevail as at the date of my last report. Nothing particular has transpired during the month there to de mand especial mention. The workings at Budgeon's Flat, which I noticed at the time of its discovery, continue to pay admirably. The quartz reef at the head of Brown's likewise promises well. The Red Hill Company, and Mines Royal have, after a long and protracted struggle, reached deep ground, which is expected to be the long sought for gutter. On the Hong Kong Lead the Black Hill work is going forward briskly. The Moscow and Equitable Companies are realizing first rate returns, which fact has given a strong impetus to the furtherance of operations on the succeeding claims. Within the month a lease of thirty-three acres adjoining the equitable claim has been applied for by the Lugar (?) Mining Company. The Cr\u0153sus Company, sinking for months north of the Hong Kong Lead, have struck gold. This is supposed to come from another lead, distinct from the Hong Kong, and this conviction has led to the ground being taken up in the north-west direction, to the extent No. 6. Division. (John Lynch, Mining Surveyor.) The population numbers 20,000,-1,000 of whom are Chinese. There are about 5,000 engaged in alluvial mining, and 300 in quartz mining. There are 92 steam engines at work, and 5 idle ; 41 whims at work, and 7 idle ; and there are 164 puddling machines in connection with engines, whims, &c. There is but one quartz-crushing machine in the district, which is included in the num ber of steam engines ; the other steam en gines are employed in pumping, winding, puddling, &c. On Smythesdale and Italian Gully the greater portion of the leads formerly held, and insufficiently worked, under the frontage system, are now re-occupied under the block claim regulations, and with results which clearly prove that the first step in securing the property of the gold fields consists in making such regulations as will encourage the introduction of capital and machinery suitable to the requirements of the mines. This wise and liberal consideration has been attended to by the Mining Board, who have just completed a code of rules, so thoroughly comprehensive in its provisions and details, and so clearly anticipatory of the growing and varied requirements of the district, as to supply for a long time to come every desi deratum in our local legislation. The natural consequence of such wise and liberal con cessions is clearly perceptible in the eagerness with which the industriously disposed por tion of the miners are securing ground for themselves, not only where good prospects are reported, but on ground hitherto regarded unproductive ; and as I have before me the"], [183, "MINING SUBYEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 JANUABY. 9 of three large block claims, and a lease of 33 acres, (the Pandora.) The Black Hill Puddling and Sluicing Company have their fittings and machinery nearly completed. Mr. Lock's operations for a similar experiment on Frazer's and the Surfacing Hill are going forward with afresh, under Bye-Law XI, and the parties are all sanguine of full recompense. The Argo Company have struck the gutter. The Monte Christo and Prince of Wales are paying. Of the other large companies here, viz. : \u2014 the Kossuth, Hotspur, All Nations, Morning Light, and Waterloo Companies, it would be prematuie to form an opinion at the present stage of their proceedings. Nothing particular has transpired at Carngham within the month. The usual steady and prosperous routine of business still obtains there. One instance of a lack of enterprise I have not failed to notice on the part of the quartz miners there, viz. : \u2014 their dilatoriness in pro curing efficient quartz-crushing machines, after the repeated trials they have had of the paying qualities of the reefs. Linton's has been for a considerable time back, and still continues to be the centre of attraction. The richness of the Standard Lead has far outshone that of any other in the dis trict. When as high as 84 ozs. to a machine is washed on a lead which does not involve any heavy expenditure, it is but natural to expect that other places will be held in abey ance whilst a chance remains to be obtained near the source of such fortunate employment. This desertion is very sensibly felt both at Happy Valley and Lucky Woman's, which were themselves, until lately, highly prized localities. Almost all the hills and gullies there are deserted by the population for the superior advantages of Linton's. The Flag staff Lead, to the south-west of the Standard, promises well too: and the Black Lead, which 1 noticed in a previous report as just then ex hibiting symptoms of revival, continues to advance in public regard. Prospecting parties are around in all direc tions exploring range and gully ; and there are numbers daily increasing, almost every day giving renewed encouragements to the adventurous prospectors. At Spring Dallah the tunnelling parties adverted to in previous reports are pushing on their excavations well; but the magnitude of the undertaking is rather out of proportion to the limited means employed for its accom plishment; however, that they have the united leads from Linton and Happy Valley within their claims is a question that scarcely admits of doubt, and its effectual working will be only a matter which can be deter mined when the tunnels are pushed on farther. energy. Some of the Surfacing Companies on Smythesdale Flat, and the nil Is surrounding Brown's, are turning out profitably. The chief drawback in the latter locality arises from the scarcity of water. This want could be simply remedied by constructing dams at suitable sites in the many capa cious gullies which are falling into the basin at Brown's. There is no other source from whence an adequate supply of water for sluicing and puddling the Surfacing Ranges could be ob tained, but for the deep sinking, sufficient can be at all times had from the drifts. It is to be regretted that the heavy volume of rain-water which annually falls in this dis trict is allowed to run to waste, more es pecially as a trifling outlay in the construc tion of substantial dams and capacious reser voirs would suffice to conserve an abundant supply for all the requirements of sluicing and surface puddling \u2014 a branch of mining which, I am confident, would add an enor mous item to the revenue of the district, and be a most extensive source of employ ment. For domestic purposes enough can be had both for Smythesdale and Brown's from the head of Smythe's Creek. The point of the creek from which it could be most economi cally diverted is several feet higher than the township of Smythesdale. I have ascertained the difference of level, and I beg to forward you a plan showing the most convenient course for a water-race, should the growing requirements of the township hereafter re quire it. At Monkey Gully, the Havelock Company holding a lease, are doing well. The Falcon and Morning Star Companies have tested their respective claims, and are satisfied of their paying capabilities, yet business is rather strangely protracted in them. The Hartly and Northern Company, as well as the City of Durham and Mesley's, have all very good prospects before them. The Cambrian, and Prince of Wales, which extend to Brown's pre-emptive right, have proved the locale of the gutter, towards which they are now penetrating with deter mined ardour. A plan and section of this ground can alone give a proper idea of its nature, and for this purpose I have commenced the preparation of one which I shall do myself the honor to transmit to you. Between this place and Linton's pre emptive right a new gully called the Saw pit has within the month started into notice. The Formosa Company, Italian, have been continually favoured with splendid dividends. On the Black Ball the abandoned ground which was declared incapable of paying under the old system of scanty areas is all taken up"], [184, "MINING SUEYEYOES' EEPOBTS JANUABY. 10 Owing to the dryness of the season, and consequent scarcity of water, mining opera tions are much retarded, A number of pud dling machines engaged in washing surface and shallow ground have stopped working; there is, therefore, a corresponding shortness in the yield of gold for this month. The Bald Hill Lead is progressing slowly; only one party during the month has reached the gutter; the yield is rather better, aver aging fourteen ounces to the machine. On the Red Streak the Crown, or Ten Acre Company, unfortunately lost their shaft, which has bad the effect of breaking up the company, most of the sbareholdi is being unable to meet the expense required for a new one. The accident happened when the men were at dinner, otherwise a serious loss of life would have been the consequence, as the shaft went from the bottom drift, and was completely filled up in a few minutes, owing chiefly to the timber used in slabbing not being sufficiently strong, This is a very serious loss, as it retards the development of the leads of gold to the north-west of I res wick; the Crown Company being the furthest aervanced company, and in the deepest ground. I forward a section of their shaft, and two others on this lead. The only additon made to crushing ma chinery at Creswick during the month has been the ten horse power engine with eight bead of stamps, which commenced operations by crushing cement for othei parties. This engine is on the Hard Hill, on which hill the owners have a claim, but have not yet cleared out the water from the old workings. One crushing of twelve tons- from another claim has yielded 37 ozs. 4 dwts. ; the other crushing, chiefly of tailings and refuse ce ment, has only yielded a few dwts. to the ton. The several claims that have been taken up on it are represented on the accompanying plan. The discovery of gold was made in the prospecting claim of Bailie, Robinson, and Company ; but as no official report has been yet made of the value of this discovery, I must trust to hearsay report for the present. which has in this instance not estimated it less than 2 dwts. to the tub. I believe there is a gutter there which will join the main leads from Linton's at or near the leasehold of the Scotch Grey's Company. The Spiing Dallah Gold Mining Company working the Block claim of that name marked on the plan, have bottomed too shallow ; but the dip of the reef on the bottom of the shaft was such as to indicate the close proximity of the lead should the same rate of inclination continue The North American Company on the Rock claim, near Happy Valley, have com menced another shaft, the oiigiual shaft not being large enough. At Derwent Jack's there is very little doing at present. The few shafts that were bottomed have not answered expectations and in consequence, many left without thoroughly testing the ground. There is but one resolute party persevering now. and the others are meiely lingering on in painful procrastination, awaiting to see what the exertions of this solitary company may unfold Creswick Division. (James Stevenson, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows: \u2014 I would estimate the quanity of water re quired on this gold tied for domestic and sanitary purposes at 70 000 gallons per diem. 1 also estimate the quantity of water used in the winter season by the sluicing parties (9 in number), who get their supply first, and directly from the different sources of supply, at 2,500,000 gallons in 24 hours. This water is, however, used repeatedly again iu its course, supplying other sluice streams, dams, puddling machines. &c, at Creswick, and after wards supplies Clunes. There are four sources from which a large supply ol water could be made available for the use of the gold held throughout the year, viz. :\u2014 Birdie's Creek, the two branches of Back Creek, and Slaty Creek. All these take their rise in the deep chocolate land forming the dividing range, and continue near their sources to run at all seasons ; owing, however, to the absorbing nature of the ground, viz., deep red chocolate soil on The machinery is as follows The approximate value of all plant within the division is \u00a386,( the mining ,000.

There are numeious places scattered over an area of 32 square miles that could be easily made availab'e for a large storage of water, more especially as the water at the sources of these creeks is 300 feet above the highest part of the township of Creswick I may add that the water of the above is excellent in quality. , during the last month, which yielded 856 oz. 11 dwt. of gold. The Clunes Mining Company (quartz) are only working the upper level opened in their new shaft, depth, 151 feet 6 inches. The lower chamber. 228 feet, is at present submerged in water, owing to a deficiency of power in the engine to keep it down. Temporary winding gear (viz : \u2014 a four inch flat rope pnd buckets) is being wrought to raise the stone, but these will shortly be supplemented by iron cages and double winding gear, worked by a more powerful engine. As soon as their arrange ments are more complete I shall forward drawings. At the present time the workings are merely extended on the same level as before shown without any particular feature to note specially. The Criterion Company have fitted up their new winding engine of 16-horse power. The shafting timber and poppet heads are of a superior construction. The whole of the former workings have been filled up with dirt cut away from the hill to make a site for the erection of the engine seat and house. The new main shaft, which is 6 feet 2 inches by 3 feet is down 150 feet; at 1 16 feet they struck Robinson's Reef underlaying to the west, but it is now almost perpendicular, with signs of resuming its usual underlay to the east I have before noted that this reef in the com pany's old shaft, which is 30 feet higher up the hill, and 14 feet more easterly, down to a depth of 130 feet, underlays to the ea^t by 1 in 12 feet. In my report for November, I called attention to a simplified mode of ad justing iron lifters to batteries erected for wooden lifters, which having been found to work well the company are about to apply to each of their batteries. I herewith enclose drawing of the same The yield from 527 tons crushed during the month was 343 ozs. 1 dwt. 18 grs. Clunes Uuited Company have been working on the eastern reef at a depth of 105 feet, without favourable results. They have put in a cross cut at the boundary of their claim and the Ciiterion Company's. From the Kastern Reef, at 30 feet, they cut the Old Man's Reef, 12 feet wide, very hard, and not worth working. Driving west 12 feet they struck the Robinson's Reef, about 10 feet wide which at this point is very disordered, being mixed with patches of slate reef, &c, in loose irregular forms 'I be stone is here poor. The company have driven south on the iode 25 feet. There are indications of its as suming a more defined and compact character. They have opened a drive to the east to pros pect for the Welcome Reef, which they believe they have secured in their late exten sion of ground. The Yankee Company have worked out the Eastern Keef down to 150 feet, and filled Birche's Creek could easily be connected with the Back Creek by means of earthen ware pipes which would be quite sufficient, as there would be little pressure till the water reached the reservoir at the lowest level, from which it would be carried across the valley of Slaty Creek to Creswick, and which should be done by iron pipes An effort was made during the month to form a Water Company for supplying the township of Creswick, and using the surplus for mining purposes. All the shares were readily disposed of, but owing to the uncer tainty of title, and complex state of the law as regards water rights, it was abandoned before reaching maturity. Clunes. \u2014 Considerable impetus has been given to the quartz workings by the erection of improved and extended mechanical ap pliances The Port Phillip Company have erected their new and powerful engine which is nominally of 60-borse power, but capable of working up to nearly 100-horse power. The cylinder is 24 inches in diameter, 4 feet stroke, expansive, cuts off the steam at one fourth the stroke, and there are double slides of piston-rods front and back. There are three tubular boilers of 30-horse power, each capable of withstanding a pressure of 80 to 90 Ibs. per inch, but the usual force will not exceed 50 or 60 Ibs Each boher is fitted up with a dome for a reservoir of steam, and the funnels are covered in by plate-iron, and act as heaters of the water which is conducted to the boiler by direct communication. The connection with each boiler can be cut off at pleasure. The boilers will be encased in felt, wood, and sheet iron, which have been adjusted, and forwarded with the engine. They are fitted with the necessary steam in dicators and two safety valves to each boiler, with signal whistles to two boilers. Tiie cranks and shafts are of the best bam mered iron, and are so arranged with ratchet clutches that all the batteries can be worked separately. The cost of the engine, &c, de livered on the claim is about \u00a33.300 ; this is independent of the alteration of the batteries which cannot now be stated. The batteries, as remodelled, will have cast-iron boxes as a foundation for the beds, which will rest on massive timbers. The iron lifters will weigh 6 cwt. each.

Their present operations on this reef are at a depth of 200 feet. They have driven north and south along the reef about 20 feet. At this level they have put in a cross cut from the shaft, in about 30 feet west, with a view to test the Old Man's Keef at this spot. This has heretofore been found to be a well-developed lode, but almost non-auriferous. In the drive they cut a vein of quartz two feet thick, running N.E. by E., tapering off to a few inches and displaying indications of being a wedgelike spur from the Eastern Reef. The stone is auriferous, and although it has not been filled up com pletely, I venture to send a sketch of this singularity. The Eastern Reef with this company was, at the cap, 30 feet thick ; at the present workings it is 5 feet on the average, well defined, and regular, with an underlay to the east of 2 in 3 f et. I am unable to give detailed returns of quantities yielded, but am informed that lj ozs. per ton has proved the average. The Victoria Company have not yet struck the Eastern Reef.

The indications of the dip tend to show that another gutter will be traced from the apex of either the Welcome or Eastern Reefs \u2014 more southerly than the lead which has heretofore proved so rich. The character of the washdirt is the same, and from tests it offers considerable encouragement to the shareholders. This company are suffering from an insufficient supply of water; they pay \u00a315 weekly to the Victoria Company for the water pumped from their mine, and an amount to the North Clunes Company for their supply. The yield during the past month has been 200 ozs. 5 dwts. 13 grs. North Clunes Eureka Company are down 118 feet through hard basaltij rock. It is difficult to be worked by the gads, being of a tough nature, or by blasting, as from its porous character it offers scarcely any resis tance to the explosion of powder. There is a peculiarity in the rock at the present depth. It is completely honeycombed; the apertures are variable, some several inches in diameter, and are coated with a kind of chrysolite, columnar in form, tinged with green and yellow, but the majority are white. Parts of the rock indicate the presence of copper, From tests which I have used I believe the crystals consist of carbonate of lime. They are rendered harder by contact with the atmosphere. The quantity of water is still great; 30 gallon buckets having to be kept constantly at work. The shareholders are in good hopes of bottoming in a week or two, and calculate on several years' remunerative labor Eaton and party having taken up a water right on the river Bulloorook, are (pending the arrival of their engine to pump water for a supply to the miners and residents on North Clunes) sluicing the headings from abandoned claims. The yield is about 1 dwt. per horse load, which owing to the quantity operated upon pays well. The dam is finished and the water brought to the point for being pumped. The height to lift the water is 70 feet, aud the length of the race nearly two miles.

I have seen some good stone which has been raised. Alluvial Mining. \u2014 I have heretofore men tioned North Clunes as meriting prominent notice ; at present the whole of the claims alongside the paddock are deserted, although some four or five companies appear to have made a reservation by leaving their whims standing and the shafts secured, also their washing apparatus on their claims. The shareholders are understood to have left for some of the recent rushes. The only claims at work are the Clunes Company (tributers), the North Clunes Eureka Company's pros pecting shaft, and B'aton and party, sluicing headings from abandoned claims. The Clunes Company's operations have recently been unprofitable, owing to the ex penses of repair and necessary dead work, and the ground has also proved very poor. They puddle about 1,296 cubic feet of dirt to the machine, which yields about 10 ounces of gold, very much below former averages. I forward a drawing of the deep ground now almost worked out, which, until lately, has The Young Son's of Freedom on the Southern Hill have deepened their shaft 8 feet, and opened their drive to strike a level with the main workings, so as to facilitate the transmission of wash-dirt by tramway. The air below is also improved thereby. They use the tail water conveyed in boxes from the Port Phillip Company. The wash-dirt, which is 7 or 8 feet deep, has lately yielded half-an-ounce to the load.

In the south end the reef is keeping its usual thickness (32 feet), but to the north it is reduced to 12 feet at a depth of 80 feet. A company is being formed to work the Little Hill, so that at present operations are suspended. Several parties are now anxiously taking up claims of the old quartz tailings formerly crushed at Mount Egerton. One party is erecting a water-wheel on Cantwell's Creek, for the purpose of crushing the tailings there, and is in hopes of realizing from 4 to 7 dwt. per ton from them. The only alluvial operations going on now are confined to a few parties constructing dams in All Nations' Gully, for surface washing when the rain sets in. Mining is much retarded for want of water.

The engine is 35-horse power, and the stampers are King's circular revolving patent.

The parties who have taken up the large mass of tailings referred to in my previous report, have obtained with their insufficient and limited appliances very good results; so much so as to warrant them in erecting proper machinery for extracting the gold, and preserving the black sand. No returns have yet been made from the Clrouometer Reef The Gibraltar Company have raised since I last reported 229 tons of quartz, which is now been crushed at their mill. They have extendp-d their main drive 20 feet farther north than any of the previous workings, and the vein, iu the opinion of the captain. presents a more favorable appearance, both in thickness and quality, than it has ever exhibited before. This is the lowest level in their ground, viz., 330 feet deep. Upon these above mentioned companies depends the proper and efficient solution of the payable qualities of the deep ground on this field. The Gibraltar workings have up to this time proved that the lode increases in richness as it goes deeper. The proprietors of the Perseverance.

The Sailor's Reef Company, as far as their small machinery will allow, are carrying on trii-ir operations, which, I believe, are payable.

The Scotchman's Prospect claim is at work, and will crush in a few days. The New Year's Prospect Company are not obtaining such good results from their ground as their first crushings warranted them to anticipate. On the Moorabool river, operations are still carried on vigorously, and the machine for puddling and washing erected there gives great satisfaction to the diggers. -The ground held by the Moorabool Gold Washing and Sluicing Company is still un worked. It is 50 acres in extent. The diggings on Dolly's Creek are still pro gressing favorably. Fresh discoveries are being made, and additions daily made to the population.

On Trewhella's Reef the works of the Pioneer Company are progressing rapidly. The crushing machinery is nearly completed. Trewhella Bros. are working steadily, and obtaining remunerative quartz, as also the Pioneer Company. The United Company have erected their whim, and are preparing their works for the ensuing season, in a far more satisfactory manner than has been done hitherto. this time of the year. Very little rain has fallen this summer; much smaller, indeed, than it has done for several years past. Un fortunately no register is kept now of the rain fall at Beechworth, and for the want of it we are unable to compute the supply that is available to the miners. The plan I send down is of part of Woo ragee Creek, a tributary to Reid's Creek. This tributary drains a large tract of country, and the ranges adjoining being of a granite formation, the water quickly flows off the surface, and floods the creek to a considerable height. From this source a large supply of water can be made available, and from prospects I have lately seen taken from the banks of the Woolshed, all the water will be required and made use of with the assistance of dams, in every locality that is suitable for the purpose. From the mouth of it where it flows into the lower end of Reid's Creek, 2,000 yards in length, have been lately taken up by a Mel bourne company, who have commenced cutting a tail race, and intend to thoroughly re-work the ground. It is really surprising how slovenly most of themineis abstract the gold from the soil. For instance, in the lower end of this creek I saw several pros pects taken from immediately under where the ground had already been worked, and which gave from 3 to 4 grains to the dish, with half an ounce of black sand (or tin ore). About 50 yards from this there is a small lead of black sand, from which 30 pounds were obtained with a dish in the course of an hour. The Falkirk and Norwood Company on Yankee Reef are busily employed getting their works in good working order. Their machinery is erected, and has been at work for a short time, but not having sufficient water they have been obliged to suspend crushing operations. Only a few tons have been crushed by this company, but not with a satisfactory result, having only yielded 6 dwt. per ton. Tbe shareholders are san guine, believing that they have a good claim. On Johnson's Reef all is activity. The Early Bird Company expect to have their machine in working order during February, and are sanguine that their claim will pruve very remunerative They certainly have obtained some splendid specimens, which I think justifies the high opinion they ho d of their claim. The Golden Point Com pany have also obtained some very good specimens from their lower level (100 feet.) but I am not enabled to report as to the yield of their claim during the month. Herewith I have the honor to forward a tracing of portion of Lerderderg Creek and Nuggetty Gully. Tn Reid's Creek the soil has been washed three times over, and will very probably be washed two or three times more before it is done with. Notwithstanding the experience the miners have had I still See them washing with only two or three sluice boxes of twelve feet long each. Now there is so much fine gold w ich exposes a large surface in propor tion to its weight, and this, taken in connec tion with the fact of its being mixed up with decomposed granite, sand, and tin ore. would necessitate a considerable power of water, indeed it absolutely requires from 40 to 100 yards (the longer the better) of boxes, en closing false bottoms to prevent the gold from being washed away. Leanman's party who have cut their ex tensive tail race, shown in my plan of Reid's Creek, are having 190 yards of sluice boxes with a fall of 1 in 72. Harrup's party are also having a great length of boxes, but the fall in many parts is only. I understand, 1 in 144. This is not sufficient, and the conse quence will be that they will choke up and require to be constantly cleared instead of self-acting.

The mining population is as follows : \u2014 In my last month's report I informed you that a payable lead had been struck in Bowman's Forest; since then two shafts have been sunk but both have proved failures, and the lay of the bed rocks shows that the lead trends nearer to the ranges than was expected, inducing No. 3 claim to commence a fresh shaft accordingly. I also mentioned in my last report that a considerable portion of abandoned ground had been taken up by a private Melbourne company. They have commenced vigorous operations with the assistance of fifty men, and have also just got up a strong engine of 12-horse power. The ground had been previously sluiced to a depth of from 1 to 3 feet, and underneath this the hard cement begins from 6 to 18 feet deep. It is very hard and requires to be blasted. I have taken up pieces of this cement sparkling with fine gold; aud when broken up and washed containing a considera ble quantity of black sand. If gold runs through the general body of the cement in even a much smaller quantity than the sam ples which I saw, it ought to pay splen didly for the working. It runs several miles in length, parallel to the creek, with a breadth of from 10 to 40 chains, and con sequently the quantity is counted by millions of cubic yards. Hitherto the miners have looked upon it as no good, and sunk through it to get to the bed rock from two to eight feet below, upon which a gravelly wash dirt is found which pays well, but the water is very troublesome. The cement requires to be burnt and water poured upon it, when it becomes friable and fit for sluicing. This is one instance out of many showing how little developed this district is at the present time. The El Dorado is another instance where two companies have bottomed within the last two months, and come upon a splendid paying ground, which will take from three to five Europeans. Chinese.

The puddling mills are all in the Snake Valley Division. The wheels are all in the Yackandandah Division. With respect to the progress of mining operations in these districts for the past month, there is absolutely nothing to report, as owing to the want of water for washing purposes nearly all operations are at a stand still. On the Nine-mile some few parties, chiefly holders of spring rights, get sufficient to work short hours, but the general average is not more than three days a week, and even those not full working hours. On the Yackandandah a number of parties are at work in the creek (it taking the first right of water), but the greater number of the Hill claims are registered dry, pending the advent of rain. In many instances the claimholders occupy themselves in stripping large paddocks down to the washdirt, which they will put through as soon as they can get water. The extensive tail races enumerated in a former report are progressing favorably, most of the parties cutting expecting to have them completed before the winter season. This method of working by means of long tail races cut low enough to have the sluice in the bed rock, judging by the two in operation on the Nine-mile, (a plan of which I for warded with a former report,) as also that of one in the Yackandandah district, is a most excellent and remunerative plan of washing.

Were there only a good supply of water brought to bear in these districts, 1 am confident that no other gold field in the colony would show a more steadily increasing yield of gold than that of the Nine-mile (or Snake Valley), and the Yackandandah. The Pioneer Company are pushing ahead, there being 28 men engaged thereon. They expect very shortly to be able to supply a large number of miners with water. The Ovens Gold Fields Water Company have not as yet resumed operations. The Prospecting party mentioned in a re port as prospecting on the Indigo Creek, have not been successful in finding any pay able ground on that creek, and are at present prospecting on the Middle Creek. They have found gold, but not as yet in sufficient quan tities to be payable. DuriDg the last month, owing to the want of water, the following leads, viz : \u2014 the Indigo, Devonshiie, Caledonian, and Dur ham, although each of them has been fully working, have presented little or no result in the shape ol gold. It is necessary to say, however, that so far as prospects from wash dirt already raised may be relied upon, there is no reason to apprehend any falling off in the yield when the much wanted water is to be obtained. I am sorry to say, that the gully which I mentioned in my December report at having been rushed, and taken up under the name of the Stanley Lead, is now quite deserted, the great depth of the ground aud its extreme patchiness having rendered its working under our present mining cir cumstances not payable.

Chiltern Le\u00bbd. \u2014 This lead is still very much troubled with water, and taking into consideration the depth of the sinking and water, I am afraid the machinery at present used on the lead will be found altogether in sufficient to admit of many of the claims being worked in a payable manner. There is still nothing new to report from this lead. Since my last report no fresh shaft has been bottomed, and the few claims which have struck the lead present nothing calling for special notice. Suffolk Lead, Upper New Ballaarat, and Stockyard. \u2014 The lower part of the Suffolk Lead continues to hold out well. The upper part of the Suffolk and New Ballaarat, in cluding the Stockyard continue to be worked by the Chinese, who, from all I hear, are de riving very fair wages. New Ballaarat. \u2014 The claims on this lead which are bottomed are doing remarkably well, but no fresh shafts have been bottomed since my last report. Skeleton Lead, after having been all but abandoned for a length of time, is now being re-prospected by three distinct parties. During the last month a new lead has been found, and called the Kincardineshire Lead. It is situated between the upper part of the Caledonian and the Durham Leads. It pros pects about 2 dwt. to the nail can from the few shafts already bottomed, though I am afraid it will be a very narrow and patchy lead. The depth of the shaft in the prospect ing claim is only 75 feet, which is the shallow est payable claim on this gold field. Another new lead, called the Cork Lead, has been found during the month, situated a few hun dred yards to the N.N.W. of Mount Pleasant. This I only regard as a leader from the main Indigo Lead. As yet I have only measured off six claims. I have also to report the dis covery of a third new lead, situated to the Indigo Division. (Thomas E. Thomely, Mining Surveyor.)

Quartz mining is pretty brisk in compari son with alluvial mining.

Bird's Reef, Kangaroo Gully. \u2014 Mr. Le Capelain, who represents a private company holding about five hundred and fifty yards along the line, is displaying great energy. He has completed the erection of one of the two fine engines the company have got upon the ground, and is about to commence with the other ; meantime he is crushing a large stack of quartz from the upper reef, above water level, until the other engine is com pleted, when he will be enabled to sink deeper. The majority of the claims on this line are doing well. Glasgow Reef, Golden Gully.\u2014 The claims on the northern end of the line are briskly working, and some are doing well. Ness and Company's claim yielded at the last crushing over six ounces to a ton, and is expected to yield more the next time. Fagg and Company have left off working the quartz, which was increasing in richness, in consequence of the water. They are now sinking a water shaft and erecting a whim ; when, no doubt, they will be able to work the quartz again. The pumping eDgine is near to completion. The (Edward T.

He is making use of the furnace built by Mr Carpenter for that purpose within the claim. This line is being extended to the south ward, along which several shafts are being sunk.

Stafford Reef, Diamond Hill, and Stafford Gully. \u2014 The German's claim on this line is still being worked, and yielding very re munerative stone. They have struck the main reef, which they found by following the underlay to a depth of one hundred feet. The second claim to the north of this is being rapidly sunk over the main reef, which dips in this direction, and will have to be sunk at least one hundred and fifty feet to cut the stone. Other claims are going down in various directions. of crushing machines are suffering from want of water. Huntly and Epsom are the only places in my division where there is any activity in alluvial mining. The Huntly Lead is still found to bear northward, while the ground is getting deeper, none of the holes being less than one hundred feet deep. The head of the rush is now about one mile beyond the limits of the surveyed lands of that parish. It is impossible for the miners to ascertain what the yield is, as they have no means of wash ing the auriferous earth, but they are still patiently working and storing the stuff in anticipation of rain. In addition to the Steam Crushing and Pumping Company, already formed at Huntly, the managers of which now have a part of the machinery on the ground, another company is about to be star ted in the same locality for a similar purpose, that of draining thewet bottom sogeneral here. If they succeed as it is anticipated, and are able to keep the workings sufficiently dry for the miners to sink to the bed rock, and get out the large quantity of auriferous drift now inaccessible, there is little doubt but that the Huntly gold field, and indeed the whole of the imperfectly worked Epsom and Ironstone Leads will yet be highly productive.

Heathcote, The mining population is as follows: \u2014 This supply may be obtained in part by the collection of the storm-water, and in part by pumping. The drainage ground is extensive, and the configuration of the surrounding country is naturally favorable for the collection of storm-water in reservoirs, at an elevation whence it might run in open watercourses into all the auriferous gullies. Most of the water required for gold washing and puddling might he obtained from those reefs which are likely to be worked; the depth of which, it appears in most of them, being directly pro portional to the elevation of the locality, and in general is between 80 aud 200 feet.

As none of the quartz reefs in the district have as yet struck water, notwithstanding many of them being much more than 200 feet deep, the hope of obtain ing it by sinking shafts is very precarious. The approximate value of all the mining plant within the division is \u00a325,300. The population is in a great measure a fixed one, the returns of which are taken correctly. There is an extreme scarcity of water, so that puddling is almost wholly suspended. The majority of the reefs are paying little more than the expenses, yet they are being perseveringly worked. Two claims on the Albert Reefs average 12 oz. to the ton. The quantity of water necessary to supply the Goulburn gold fields, in their present state, as well as for their further develop ment, would be about 600,000 gallons daily. In consequence of the great dearth of water, and knowing that the ultimate progress of these fields is dependent on the obtaining of it in sufficient quantity, I have taken levels for a considerable distance along the Goulburn River, and thence to Whroo Diggings, for the purpose of ascertaining the feasibility of con veying water thereto from the river. Commencing at Mitchellstown (an esti mated distance of 20 miles from Whroo) and proceeding higher up the river to a distance of more than two and a half miles, I found a difference of level in the surface of the water of 9 96 feet (a bar in the bed of the river in tervenes of about four and a half feet in height). See section. KsLMORE Division, (F. M. Hill, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows In addition to the above there are 200 persons pros pecting, 480 erecting machinery, quartz-crushing. &c, and 120 engaged in mining operations on the Upper Goulburn. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Again commencing at Mitchellstown, and levelling down along the river to Bailestown (the distance being about eight and a half miles), taking the water level at intervals, and on the assumption of there being no change in the height of water during the period of my levelling on it, the fall of the surface in the whole distance amounted only to 17.55 feet. Kilmore Diggings. \u2014 These diggings are situated abour three-quarters of a mile west erly from Anderson's pre-emptive right, in the parish of Willowmavin, and about five miles from Kilmore. Several east and west quartz leaders have been worked, and very good stone raised. I saw specimens obtained from these which presented a very rich ap pearance. From Bailestown I went towards Whroo by the most level route, over a plain partly open and partly forest ; after which the ground has an uniform inclination as far as Balaclava Hill, the difference of level between my benclumark on its summit and the one at the point of commencement being 279.24 feet.

At the Junction, mining operations are much retarded by the stoppage of Messrs Williamson and Brunstine's crushing mill, owing to the want of water. Good stone, however, is still being raised from the Junc tion Reef. At the Teatree Creek, considerable activity prevails, although the want of more crushing machinery there is still very apparent. The plant already erected by Messrs. McKay, Joiner, and Co., is fully employed from their own reef, (Welcome) which is still yielding good returns. A large quantity of rich stone is now raised from the Enniskillen, and other reefs in its neighborhood, and should machinery be erected there, a most favorable return might be expected. Alluvial ground has been opened on the Teatree Creek, and gold found. The pro specting party are working the bed of the creek, removing about two feet of loose drift. The wash-dirt consists of the decomposed particles of the slate rock which forms the bed of the creek. The slate runs in combs, bearing a little to the west of north, and having a westerly dip. The wash-dirt is stacked, and the party intending to erect a puddling mill as soon as the rainy season commences. The yield, 1 am informed, will be about two pennyweights to the load. Other parties are also sinking on the flat adjoining the creek ; but from the depth they have to sink, and the large body of water to contend with, they had not bottomed at the time of my visit Alluvial gold has also been found in the Muddy Creek, about nine miles above Yea, on Mr. McLeishe's station. A prospecting claim has been taken up, and the party intend turning the creek ; an undertaking of con siderable expense. A good prospect was ob tained by this party, from one of the slate bars running across the creek. A new reef has also been found about six miles easterly from the Teatree diggings, near the Junction on the Newchum and Muddy creeks. A lease for mining purposes of 4a. Or. 20p. of the old ground has been applied for, and should it prove remunerative, efficient quartz crushing and puddling machinery will be brought on the ground. Reedy Creek. \u2014 Mining matters just now present iather a dull appearance. SSeveral of the reefs which had previously yielded a good return have considerably fallen off; such, however, having been the case with some of the best reefs in the colony, I feel little doubt that the reefs on Reedy Creek, on being more extensively worked, will be found to yield again as richly as ever. The oldest established lines, however, are still giving handsome returns. Nothing new has occurred in alluvial mining, the want of water having stopped all the sluicing, and many of the puddling parties on this field, besides which a considerable number of miners have left this for other fields. On the King Parrot Creek the reefs are looking well, although many claims are still registered, owing to the presence of water in large quantities, as well as to the want of crushing machinery. The alterations making in Mr. Fortune's ma chinearenot yet complete. Another machine, lately purchased by Mr. Doyle, on Reedy Creek, is in course of erection, and when both are fairly at work there is every probability of good returns being realised, gold having been found in payable quantities for a length of nearly a mile and a half on one line (Whittaker's). With crushing at a moderate figure the claims on Hannigan's and Murchi son's lines of reef wil!\u00bbgive payable results. The alluvial sinking on the Triangle Creek has been abandoned owing to the large body of water present. Still from the prospect obtained there, 1 believe, that, were a large party to undertake the working of the ground, gold would be found in remunerative quan tities. The King Parrot Creek presents strong auriferous indications, and rough gold has been obtained from thence. . MARYBOROUGH MINING DISTRICT. Maryborough Division. (D. O'Leary, Mining Surveyor.) At Yea the reefs are still working. A small quantity of picked stone from McLeishe's reef, crushed at Reedy Creek, gave a large return.

Wells and Catchpole, a somewhat novel attempt is about being made by a party of miners to lift the water out of a chain of ponds in this portion of the Back Creek for sluicing purposes. First, it is contem plated (see tracing No. 2) to lift the water from the creek at a by means of common lift pumps to an elevation of 38ft. 6 in. at b ; from b to c the water will run in an open race by its own gravitation ; and again, a similar process is to be resorted to at c as that employed at a, to lift the water to d, another elevation of 31ft. 6 in. Should the project prove successful, the parties could command for washing purposes the surround ing gullies, and several rich surface patches recently discovered in this locality. Quartz Mining. \u2014 This has, though still attracting considerable attention, received no fresh impulse. Another lease of 25 acres is about being obtained by a new company, called the Shamrock Reef Mining Association. The Shamrock runs through the middle of this block, which is situated between the Mariners' and Amherst road. It is a new reef just about being prospected, on the result of which will depend the future success of this mining association. The little that has been doing in alluvial mining by those who have not, or perhaps could not follow the rushes, is mostly in the shallow sinking in the old leads and gullies scattered throughout the division, and which have been tried a dozen times over. In the face of this fact it might appear astonishing why the miners do not sum up courage enough to try the deep ground in several of those old leads which they know full well contain gold in no small quantities. There are the Alma, Chinaman, and Havelock Flat, wet leads, all proved highly auriferous, and which require only some efficient system of working to prove highly remunerative ; but it is to be regretted the diggers cannot, with out the assistance of some capital, embrace those opportunities, it being well known that seven-eighths of the mining population here have been struggling for a mere subsistence, nevertheless some attempts have been made by a few persevering diggers to discover those lost leads, attempts which have as yet proved ineffectual, no doubt on account of the limited means employed.

As stated in my last report, the probability of several of the leads being again occupied is becoming daily more evident, for steps have already been taken on the part of several of the miners in that direction. Rocky Flat. \u2014 Many of the original claim holders have returned and intend to resume their claims, which will doubtless be worked with some amount of vigor, in consequence of the party in the second claim east of the prospectors having obtained gold in very re munerative quantity. The prospect, as ac knowledged by themselves, is equal to five ounces to the load. There is an immense quan- The Caledonian Company, after contending for seven months against an immense body of water (5000 gallons per hour) have at length discovered payable gold in a gutter at the end of a drive 40 feet long. No. 1 tracing shows the position of the ground about to be leased by this company, and the vertical section of the shaft shows the po sition of the gutter. The wash-dirt is com posed of drift gravel, boulders, and very little clay (5J feet) and 1J feet of bottom consisting of loose yellow slate and pipeclay. In theloottom the best of the gold is found, and from the unusual height (6| feet) of washing stuff taken, it cannot be expected that the mixture will average much. There has been but one trial washing yet, the result of which I am unable to ascertain. So. Horse-power.

Although, therefore, this is a \"frontage\" lead, it is not improbable that there may be some random sinking, and it is still not a matter of certainty that there are not two leads not far distant from each other, instead of one only. returns of the quartz reefs for the past month have not been so satisfactory as could be wished. Perseverance however will prove their value, when doubtless it will be dis covered that Amherst forms no exception to the general rule, that where there are good alluvial diggings payable reefs may be ex pected. The Old Scandinavian is still yielding pay able cement, in quantities sufficient to keep the crushing machines in full employment. Referring once more to the scarcity of tfater, it may be mentioned that the creek is so thoroughly dry, that one of the crushing engines is supplied by using a horse-whim to bale water from a hole on the Black Lead. Much of the stability of the division depends on an efficient water supply, and a mode of obtaining that desideratum will be suggested in a future report. Rocky Point. \u2014 Near the junction of this with the Union Lead such good prospects have been obtained that an impetus will be given to the exertions of the miners on it. One party has made application for a lease of ten acres along this lead, but the application is likely to meet with some determined oppo sition, on account of the character the lead has obtained from the prospects above alluded to, and the very general dislike that the miners have to the leasing system. Black Lead. \u2014 Signs of resuscitation are being evinced here, although slowly; in many cases of desertion of claims on the Black Lead, the shallow rush at Lamplough was the primary cause; it is therefore not impro bable that it will all be taken up again before long ; indeed, in many cases, as far as this lead is concerned, the deep ground has never been reached. Avoca Division. (R. English, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows Mysterious Lead remains as reported last month, still unoccupied. Union Lead shows signs of vigor still ; oc casional patches are struck, yet the general feeling of the parties at work here is not highly in its favor. Of the old ground little can be said further than that an occasional worker may be seen but perhaps the chief reason for this is the want of water, which is severely felt through out the whole division, so much so that to give tables of \" machines at work, and idle\" would perhaps he impossible, as many of the idle machines are only in that state in conse quence of a want of water supply ; whilst others are so from a want of auriferous earth sufficiently near them to render washing operations even in a moderate degree re munerative Note. \u2014 These tables are the result of my owd obser vation (except the St. Arnaud return, which was furnished by a miner from that place), and comprise only those engaged in raining The total population of the district I estimate at 25,000. I have the honor to report that the general state of this district since my last presents no change worthy of note, excepting St. Arnaud and the Lamplough Diggings. At the former place, mining, since my last, is in an improved condition, consequent upon two new payable quartz veins having recently been discovered, situated in the Mallee scrub, the precise locality and yield of which I have not yet ascertained ; but shall visit the work ings, and give more detailed information in my next month's report. At Lamplough. the two leads are being steadily worked, but do not progress in new ground so rapidly as heretofore. The trend of the deep lead 'or working, has varied con siderably, also in its width of working ; not more than six chains wide cow seem to be remunerative, and from the tortuous course the lead has now taken is very difficult to trace. A branch working from this, five and six chains wide in a north direction, heading into what is termed Wise's paddock, and now contiguous to the boundary of Mr. Hodgkin son's pre emptive section, is paying on an Of the prospecting claims mentioned iu my last report, that on the east side of Mount Greenock is bottomed, and abandoned; that on the west is not yet bottomed. Several parties are at work at the north foot of the mount, both on Crown and private land ; and hopes are entertained that a de fined lead will yet be discovered in this locality; although the proximity of private property may have an injurious effect on its early development. Prosp-cts from the quartz reef at the Camp Reserve, Amherst, have not been so satis factory as anticipated when the crown of the reef was first broken up ; and the general Europeans.

A number of claims have also been taken by the miners upon this pre-emptive section. The conditions upon which they occupied the ground were, that seven shillings each claim of 40 feet, be paid ; that area being secured to them for one month, unless they choose to sink, when one pound additional was charged ; an arrangement which gave general satis faction amongst the miners. Very few paid the pound for sinking, and those who did, have not succeeded in finding payable ground. Where the lead was expected to continue its course, it is generally believed now that the auriferous ground lies in a more northerly direction, passing through another portion of the pre-emptive section, which has recently been surveyed, and laid out in streets and building allotments for a township. Each of these leads or workings have con siderably diminished in their width of work ings ; consequently the surplus miners have in various directions been prospecting, some in new ground, others trying thev old con tiguous workings. Several prospecting holes have been sunk in various parts of the flat between here and Avoca; in some of which gold has been found, yet not in sufficient quantity to induce them to continue. The vaiious strata, depth of sinking, together with the bed rock, I have observed, varies this field, together with the large quantity now being sold (I saw myself a parcel of two hundred ounces of gold which was taken from two claims last week), Lamplough may safely be classed amongst the permanent and payable gold fields of Victoria.

The almost entire want of water through out the division has caused great depression both in alluvial and quartz mining during the month of January ; nearly all the puddling machines are stopped, and only two out of the twelve crushing machines in the division are at work, and both these are entirely though scantily supplied by water pumped from Poverty Reef, and only one of them crushes for the public ; consequently very little quartz is being crushed, and a great number of wages-men have been thrown out of employment. No new alluvial ground has been opened with the exception of a small rush that took place in the early part of the month within one mile aud a half of Jones's Creek, and The bond fide mining population, these last few! days has been leaving in small numbers, I believe principally for the Inglewood diggings. Lamplough at present is unquestionably over-populated, especially by those in busi ness pursuits ; there appears to be nearly one place of business to each miner's tent. Considerable quantities of washdirt re main upon the Deep Lead, awaiting, I pre sume, the wet season, carting being from five to eight shillings per load. The water for washing purposes near the diggings is nearly exhausted, although a plentiful supply is yet within three miles of Lamplough. The character of the gold obtained is very coarse and nuggetty. 1 was shown several nuggets last week (twenty in number) ob tained from the Deep Lead by various parties, weighing from six to sixteen ounces each. Upon the first lead or working where the depth of sinking is about nine feet, auriferous drift is now being worked, varying in thick ness from one to seven feet, yielding on an average one ounce to the load ; and, I am of opinion, that when the wet season sets in, a large area of ground on the upper portion of each lead, partially worked, will be found calcu'ated to retain a large population of miners for some time to come, and from the extreme coarse quality of all the gold upon which is now nearly deserted. The established reefs, although most ge nerally employing their usual number of hands owing to the want of water for crush ing, are nevertheless being worked with energy ; but the quartz from new reefs (se veral of which have been opened during the month) cannot be tried till rain comes. With the exception of the Poverty Reef, Stony Reef, and Greek's Hill Companies, which are energetically at work, none of the others who have secured leases in the di- vision have as yet commenced to make pre parations. \u2022 Of these 6 arc at work and IS3 idle.

The principal spot of attraction lately has been the same small cement hills about one mile and three quarters south-east of the original township. The sinking varies from one to two feet. The best finds 1 know of Korono Division. have been obtained at about eight or ten feet. Several new gullies have been opened during the month with fair prospects. The old, or deep lead still maintains a fair number of miners who are tracing it slowly down wards. Some parties are doing well, but as there are few washing at present, owing to the high price of cartage, the yield from few claims can be ascertained. (Jolm Catto, Mining Surveyor.) Thc mining population is as follows Since this field has been opened it has cost more money to drive washing stuff to the Loddon, and water to the diggings, than would have been sufficient to have brought a supply of water on the spot, and as the field is now, and will be an extensive one, I would suggest the propriety of Government immediately doing something towards sup plying the want so severely felt. The quartz veins are still looking well, although no main reef has been properly defined.

Nearly all the puddling machines are idle, owing to the same cause, and great difficulties are experienced in getting suffi cient for domestic use on all the old fields. Nothing worthy of note has taken place in quartz mining at Korong. The Specimen Hill Company's crushing machinery is nearly completed, and will soon commence opera tions. CASTLEMAINE MINING DISTRICT. CASTLEMAINE DIVISION. (Thomas Lawrence Brown, Mining Surveyor.) The past month has been most devoid of incident or interest in mining matters in this division. The continued drought has almost entirely suspended alluvial workings, scarcely any machines having water to work with, and the ground not paying by other processes. At Kingower the Union Reef is still yield ing good returns, owing to the large body of quartz. New veins are occasionally discovered where nothing payable was supposed to exist, but until such time as more powerful ma chinery is employed, and the whole mass of quartz extracted and crushed, it will not be worked to the advantage it is capable of yielding. At Jericho only the German Reef is being worked, which is yielding some very good stone, but as none has been crushed, owing to the scarcity of water for a considerable time, its value is unknown. The Inglewood diggings notwithstanding, the over abundant supply of dust, the great So many of the machines and claims are wholly ortemporarily abandoned, andasmany of our miners are leaving for new rushes, I cannot give reliable tables (even approximate) of machinery, population, &c, therefore the tables, as per instructions, are necessarily omitted this month.

I have the honor to forward another plan of Forest Creek and Castlemaine, which joined to the last sent, gives the course of Forest Creek. A portion of a former plan is in cluded to make this one more complete. The plan shows the town of Castlemaine, and other alienated property ; also the Go vernment camp. The whole area is of the schistose formation, immense reefs of sand stone cropping out on most of the hills. Only a few quartz lodes have been pro spected within the area, none of which have yet proved remunerative. Former plans showed the greater number of auriferous reefs, and the fount from whence the alluvial gold was deposited. The alluvial workings (colored blue) were originally very good, and varied from 6 ft. to 40 ft. in depth, but are now generally ex hausted of their riches and abandoned, await ing improved machinery, and reduction in the price of labor to render re-working remunerative. in the middle of the winter, on ground recently opened. In quartz workings matters remain much the same as usual, most of the claims bond fide in work are paying, some of them even very well ; but it very seldom if ever happens that any very rich stone is struck. Most of the claims at present paying are on reefs opened for years, and the workings more generally confined to facing out the stuff left in good olden times, when 1 oz. or lj oz. per ton was not considered payable ; but which with the present mechanical appliances, and improved system of working, render an ex ceedingly handsome profit. As is generally the case, some of the richest stone has been got near the surface, where, of course, it was easiest discovered, and only few instances occur where anything very extraordinary has been got at any great depth. Owing chiefly to the imperfect mode of prospecting, a cer tain want of faith in our reefs has been created, and with the exception of a few instances, it is of very rare occurrence that more than one or two months are spent in prospecting, and not always judiciously. Wombat and Colliers' Reefs are on an average, paying; the parties have machines of their own, and two prospecting shafts are being sunk by fresh parties. Parker's Specimen Reef, and Sportsman's Reef, are both being worked briskly, and very good stone is raised. On Sportsman's Reef, lately a quantity of stone from Messrs. McAlaster & Co.'s claim realized nearly 8 oz. Hepburn Division. (Ambrose Johnson, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows: \u2014 per ton. On Doctor's Reef Messrs. Benoit & Need- ham are busily crushing, but I have not heard with what result. Perseverance Reef in Sailor's Creek is pro ducing as usual very good stone ; but the crushing machine being worked by water power, is at a standstill, the creek being per fectly dry. In Yandoit the Yandoit Quartz Mining company's machine has also ceased opera tions for want of water ; but the reef in the company's claim on Clement's Reef, I under stand, is looking as well as ever. None of the other claims on this reef have as yet struck the reef. The machinery is as follows On Christmas Reef several parties are sinking on prospect ; but I have not heard of any of them being successful as yet. Two new reefs, the Old Nuggetty Reef, Old Nuggetty Gully, and Oliver Cromwell's Reef, Glengower, were opened in January, and in both cases very good prospects have been obtained ; and a number of claims have in consequence been marked on both reefs. Puddling and Sluicing. \u2014 Our creeks as well as dams and reservoirs being perfectly dry, and our only resources being the tunnels under the basaltic plains, and a few deep shafts on Notwithstanding the extreme drought of this summer, mining matters throughout the division are in a most prosperous condition.

Most of the claims in the Glengower rush, have been registered for want of funds; but in a month 01 two, operations will probably be resumed. quartz reefs, these branches of mining have been at a total standstill, as far as Europeans are concerned. A pretty large number of Chinamen manage however, in the beds of our creeks (although the ground has been turned over and over) to make a living, aud judging by appearances they even manage to make themselves pretty comfortable on Jim Crow. Prospecting for puddling and sluicing ground has not this season, as usual, engaged many persons. Rushes in new shallow alluvial ground here and there hold out su perior inducements to our miners, nor have the Lamplough, or Inglewood Forest dig gings been without effect on our mining popu lation, although most are returning. The late Kidd's Gully rush, being situated right in the centre of our sluicing localities, has employed a large number of our puddlers and sluicers, but unless the lead is traced fuither most of the claims will soon be worked out, and a piece of ground for next winter will then become the main object to be looked after. The mining population has during the month been rather unsettled, and so many claims are being shepherded, besides the number of persons prospecting the out gullies, that, although purposely visiting the different rushes and gullies, I hardly can form a correct estimate. St. Andrew's Division. (James Murphy, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows :- In alluvial sinking s have to report that the rush at Kidd's Gully is turning out splen didly, not a week passing but some instances of good luck coming to my knowledge, and ounces to the tub are there spoken of much the same as pennyweights under ordinary circumstances. The south-eastern end of the lead, as I in formed you in my last report, was on private property, and the owner in Melbourne having appointed an agent here, the matter was referred to arbitration, and the sum of \u00a37 10s. per 60 x 60 claim stipulated for as compensa tion. Two encroachment cases arising out of this arrangement are at present pending. The Warden has sanctioned t*e working of a Government road adjoining the rush, on a deposit of \u00a32 per shaft, the money to be returned on the shaft being properly re-filled, and I have, on these conditions, allotted 12 claims of 60 feet by the width rof the road. The Crown land and unalienated allotments south-east, of the rush are also being actively prospected these last few days, and I shall not be surprised to see very important dis coveries being made towards the Italian, or Hard Hill, on Wombat Creek. I have also, these last few days, heard rumours of sime new ground being opened below Forty foot, near the Jim Crow Creek, with very good prospects, but nothing definite has as yet come to my knowledge. I have heard no news of importance from the old gullies about Yandoit, but the diggers in that locality seem at least to be earning a comfortable living. Tunnelling is steady, and parties engaged, on an average, are making rather good wages. The machinery is as follows The approximate value of all the mining plant within the division is \u00a35540. Note. \u2014 with respect to the population at alluvial working, I estimate the population of the BritatiDla Nicholson, and Emerald gold fields, at 240 in the month of January ; all the rest is the result of counting. With reference to the state of mining in this division dpiring the past month, I beg to state, that iu the western portion of the division, or that on the right bank of the Yarra, nothing worth noting has occurred in alluvial mining, except that in Spanish Gully some pretty good patches are occasionally met with.

They are also working from shafts on three other parts of the hill, and will, I have no doubt, soon realize an ample return on their outlay. They have as yet only 20 men employed in consequence of their works not being suf ficiently advanced to afford room for any more. Also, preparations for extensive sluice washing are being made by a party in Wild Dog Gully, who have now nearly completed a race of over two miles in length, for the purpose of taking their water supply from the Back Creek, a little below the junction of the Black Calf Gully, with a view to having sufficient fall to command all the parts of the Wild Dog Gully suitable for sluice wash ing. This is the first race of the kind that has been made in this division. On the Fourth Hill at Anderson's Creek, Messrs. Moore and Gerraghty, who are pro ceeding with their tunnel at a distance of 108 feet, have met with some small quartz veins, which it is supposed indicate the close proximity of the main auriferous vein for which they are driving, and will probably reach within a few weeks. The works of the Yarra Yarra Sluicing Company at Thompson's Bend, are still in complete, but are progressing. It is now stated, that the river will be turned through the cut some time in February. At Anderson's Creek, Dr. Owens having become satisfied of the efficiency of his re cently invented puddling machine, from ex periments made with the small machine, which he has been trying for some months past, is now having erected on its site one of the largest size, with several very material improvements. It is calculated that this machine will wash at least 140 loads of wash ing stuff per day, which must yield a very large return, when the richness of the ground about to be worked is taken into account, together with the fact, that the washing stuff which will yield payable gold averages three feet in depth. In quartz mining, at One Tree Hill, some very rich quartz has been taken out of the prospect claim on Swedish Reef, at a depth of 65 feet in the south end of the claim. It is estimated that in one bucket full of quartz raised, there were beyond 5 Ibs. weight of gold. This rich patch will, in all probability, extend through No. 2 south, as in that claim also they were beginning to find some very rich specimens. On One Tree Hill also Messrs. Holmes, Handle and Ricards have commenced working On the Britannia gold field nearly the whole of the mining population seem more intent on prospecting for new ground than working that already discovered. Another auriferous creek has been dis covered, to the south of, and running nearly parallel with McCrea's Creek on the Nichol son gold field, and about a mile south from McCrea's camp. This is probably the upper part of the creek that joins the Woori Yalook near its junction with McCrea's Creek. On the Emerald gold field there are only about 20 men ; these are at work on some small flats and gullies on the Cockatoo Creek (called by the few diggers there the Maccles field Diggings) but which I am informed is fast becoming deserted. The Chinese are leaving this gold field very fast.

The mining population is as follows : \u2014 number of the alluvial miners to turn their attention to quartz, and many satisfactory results have been obtained in prospecting. The Monte Christo Company have now their machinery in working order, and only wait for water to commence crushing opera tions. The companies in the vicinity (of whom there are thirteen at work) are compelled to send their quartz to the Black Hill to be crushed, and thereby incur a greater expense than if they had their quartz crushed conti guous to their claims. In alluvial mining there is little or nothing doing and I fear such will be the state of affaiis until winter sets in. The same may be said of the Dead horse Gully, and Springs localities. Here all the puddling machines are idle, and such of the population as had the means, have left for other gold fields. Generally speaking the neighborhood of the Springs is well supplied with water, but this season it would be difficult to obtain a sufficient quantity even for tub and cradle working. The machinery is as follows [Mr. Fitzpatrick has furnished a plan of part of his district, showing the gullies, ranges, claims, &c., in the vicinity of Black Hill.] No. 3 Division. Twelve alluvial claims and thirteen quartz claims have been taken up in this division during the month. The part of the district shown on the plan is at present almost the only locality in which any energy is apparent in mining operations. The greater part having been taken up for quartz mining, less water is required by the individual miner, and as the owners of machinery had taken the precaution of storing a large supply of water previous to the advent of the dry weather, there is not much inconvenience felt, except by the alluvial miners. The erection of machinery in the neighborhood of the Black Hill has caused a great change in the system of quartz mining in this locality ; as instead of pursuing the rich veins to a great depth as formerly, they now commence at the surface and send all the quartz to be crushed. This has become most necessary, as the ground having been worked in a very negligent manner at first, and no care having been taken to secure the tunnels, the ground in a great many claims has caved in, and des troyed the previous workings. Another crushing machine with twelve stampers is being erected by the Independent Company on the southern declivity of the Black Hill, and another party is clearing ground on Crocodile Gully for a site for a similar engine.

The approximate value of all the mining plant within the division is \u00a363,500. Daring the last month mining industry has been greatly retarded by the want of a sufficient supply of water to carry on the operations. a battery of sixteen stamps. The average yield from this lode, so far as it has been tried, has been about 8 dwt. to the ton. John son and party, on the same range, are also engaged in erecting crushing machinery, and have reason to suppose that the yield of the quartz will be remunerative. On the Gum Tree Flat the Llanberris Company have found it necessary to re-adjust their machinery and procure a separate engine for winding purposes. Several attempts have been made by the different companies to crush and wind with the same engine, but the result has shown that such an arrangement would not work ; the companies have, therefore, in most cases, been compelled to obtain smaller and separate engines for winding purposes. The long continuation of dry weather has compelled many of the puddling companies to cease work, as the supply of water usually obtained from their dams has entirely failed. During the last month thirty-four claims have been registered to be held in reserve, until such time as the necessary supply shall have been obtained. These companies con sist chiefly of those who were engaged work ing surface claims, and their cessation has necessarily caused a diminution in the yield of gold. When, however, the rains set in a large quantity of ground now lying idle will afford employment for a considerable number of men. In the same locality, the Enterprise Com pany have made considerable progress in the erection of a battery of eight stamps, and will probably be at work as soon as they can obtain an adequate supply of water. I may mention that all the quartz crushing companies at work have an arrangement for allowing the water to run back into their dams after it has been used for crushing and amalgamating, the tailings being allowed to settle down in receptacles prepared for them, when they are dug out and carried away in barrows. This entails the expenditure of a greater amount of labor, but the value of the water more than compensates for the extra trouble. I have also registered six claims to be held in reserve pending the arrival of machinery. When an adequate supply of water is ob tained, and the machinery now in course of erection is completed, there will be a marked improvement in the yield of gold from my district. I have still to report that the progress of quartz mining is highly satisfactory, and that great confidence is being gained in the ultimate results of the operations now in embryo. It may be remarked that several of the lodes have been worked for a considerable time by the aid of the rudest appliances, and the results obtained have been sufficient to induce the parties working to go to the ex pense of erecting costly machinery. This is more especially the case on the Canadian Hill, in which place a great deal of prospect ing has been carried on. In that locality three new stamping bat teries are now in course of erection, some of which are on a very large scale and of very improved construction. The Canadian Company are now erecting an engine of 42 horse-power, and propose to work 32 stamps. This company is at work on a lode which is reached by a tunnel driven into the face of the hill, and, from trials made, they have reason to believe that an average yield of the quartz will be about half an ounce to the ton. [Mr. Cowan has furnished a cross section of Palmer's Gully, Caledonia and Lady Barkly Leads, showing the depth of the various shafts, and the nature of the strata passed through in sinking.] No. 4 Division. (Michael O'Malley, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows: \u2014 The machinery is as follows The trials, so far, are of course only of a partial character, but so far as they have gone they serve to show that a yield higher than the estimated average will be obtained. There is an immense body of quartz in the claim, so that even if the yield should be less than is expected, the operation will prove highly profitable if the work is well carried on.

Indeed there seems to be a general lull all over the district, during the last two or three months, and until the advent of the rainy season, I fear it will at least partially continue, as the want of water seems to be the cause of our present depression. So extensively is this want felt that the comparatively few parties remaining in my division are for the most part only engaged at raising washing stuff and otherwise preparing for the anxiously expected rainfall, so that the quantity of gold at present obtained from -the alluvial workings in the division is very inconsider able ; scarcely sufficient in my opinion to afford a bare subsistence to the miner; how ever, I expect there will be a great reaction as soon as water is available, and I trust the want of it will not be so severely felt again for a long time. Frenchman's, Whitehorse, and Cobbler's leads, are just in about the same state as already oftentimes reported All the com panies on these leads are still doing battle with the rock, drift, or water, as the case may be, and although now engaged at this disheartening sort of labor for considerably upwards of three years, yet there is no telling when the gutter will be reached by any of them except one \u2014 the Prince of Wales Com pany. The Progressive Company have been very unfortunate with their shafts. They lost the first shaft in a quick sand drift, at about 80 or 90 feet, just within a few feet of the bottom, and after sinking the second to about the same depth they got swamped out and were obliged to remove and reset their engine and machinery, which they have just completed ; so that probably, before the date of my next report they will he in a position to give the other companies on the lead some valuable, or definite information regarding the paying nature of the gutter. It is generally expected from what is al ready known that a good paying lead is likely to he discovered, but of course all such expectations are liable to disappointment. At all events, one thing is certain, that if the place should prove even moderately rich, there will be a large rush, as very many persons in Ballaarat Proper have their ej'es on it, only biding their time to see what may turn up. The Staffordshire Reef, notwithstanding the unremunerative character of a large per centage of the stone, continues to yield very fair average returns, Of the recent crush ings, that of No. 3 north, yielding 119 ozs. 12 dwts. 13 grs. to 48 tons of quartz, deserves particular notice. I regret to say that No. 5 north, the large co-operative company fre quently mentioned by me so favorably and hopefully, has proved a comparative failure. After spending considerable time in the ex traction of stone, supposed to be of far more than average richness, the crushing resulted in only 8 dwt. per ton which, with the ex penses of raising, carting, and crushing has left the company partially in debt. Penrose's Reef, Moonlight, is once more in high repute. Two thousand feet south and six hundred north of the prospecting claim have been recently occupied, and shafts are being sunk and quartz raised with a vigor and will, somewhat unusual in this rather slow lo cality. Cobbler's Company, who have bottomed at a depth of 324 feet a few weeks since, and though, as is considered by some, 10 or 12 feet too shallow, have got a tolerably good prospect on the bottom of the shaft. They are now sinking in the reef, and 1 believe, intend opening out their drive or level at a depth of 340 feet, and expect striking the gutter at about 20 or 30 feet from the shaft. The company consists of 64 shareholders who took up the claim and commenced to bore for the deep ground, in the early part of 1857. They were rather fortunate in ascer taining the course of the deep ground, or gutter in a few weeks, and also fortunate with the sinking of their shaft until they got to the depth of 200 feet, when their difficulties may be said to have commenced, as between rock, drift, and water they have been two years endeavouring to force their way down 124 feet. However, the unproductive and most difficult part of the labor is done, and ultimately, I trust the party will get sub stantially remunerated for all their dead work and outlay, in the shape of good weekly divi dends extending over a period of four or five years. Their present cash expenditure is about \u00a37000. About 10 tons of stone from No. 1 south are now beieg sent on trial to the mill of W. O. Porter, and of course future operations will hinge pretty considerably on the result. Further south of this reef a prospecting claim has been taken possession of by Rich mond and party, on a hill called (after the prospector) Richmond Hill. The reef is on the surface. The great scarcity of water is painfully felt here. That in general use fur domestic purposes is for the most part very impure.

On the Mount Misery Creek the Chinese population is daily lessening. The cause of this appears to be the poverty of the ground, together with the difficulties of working by reason of water. shareholders, who are in course of sinking two shafts, one of which is 25 feet, and the other 30 feet deep. In the most northerly shaft a reef has been struck which is now three feet thick, though when first struck, at five feet from the surface, the thickness was only six inches, from which satisfactory results are anticipated. From twenty-six tons of quartz which the company have re cently had crushed, a yield of 102$ dwt. to the ton on an average has been obtained. I have omitted to send sections of this reef, so little work having been done, as yet, by this company, that scarcely any information could be given by so doing. The Pactolus Company, on the Union Jack Lead have succeeded in getting their engine to work on shaft No. 4, from which they have driven 360 feet in an easterly direction with out striking the gutter. The Pioneer Company, on the Durham Lead, have extended their tunnel towards the River Leigh for a considerable distance, and from various promising changes which have appeared in the nature of the reef, they are disposed to believe that they are near the gutter. The increase of water also is looked upon as favoring this opinion A breakage which has lately occcurred in the machinery however, will prevent their getting to the face of the drive for several days. The Telegraph Company, on this lead, are, 1 am informed, getting good wages. The Great Britain Company, as mentioned in my last report, have struck gold, and are now fairly in the gutter ; and I am informed that their prospects are very promising. On the Napoleon Lead no returns are at present being obtained, the Sons of Freedom having been swamped out for ten months, and for the next three months do not expect to be able again to commence woik. The Shallow rush, at the head of Scotch man's Lead, is now nearly worked out as regards the original claims, but the few parties who obtained extended grants are still vigor ously at work, and obtaining good wages. A small portion of ground has been opened near the Magpie Lead, on which two parties have obtained extended claims; the first has obtained fifty ounces of gold from 100 cubic feet of wash dirt within the last three weeks, the second has also good prospects. Anderson and party, on the Tower Hill (All Nations Beef), have their plant and ma chinery ready for work, but are prevented from proceeding through want of water, a want which is militating seriously against the interest of the miners in this district, many puddling machines being idle, and the work ings, more particularly the shallow ground, being almost entirely stopped. Kangaroo (iully, of all other parts of the district, appears to suffer most from the want of water; a circumstance the more readily understood from the fact of the occupants being exclusively puddlers dependent on the storm-water retained by dams quite inade quate to the storage of a full or thorough supply. The Hill is completely deserted. At Bull dog Creek the great want is water. A gentle slope skirting the creek would pay hand somely if a sufficient supply of water could be obtained.

There has been one shaft bottomed, and the prospects are very encouraging. Several other shafts are being sunk, which, from the depth they have attained, leaves very little doubt of a lead. The place is situated almost on the border of the Woady Yalloak plain, and bounded on the east bj' the Mount Bute private allotments, and on the west by the pre-emptive right of the same name, com monly called Oakley's station. The sinking is comparatively inexpensive, being as yet free from water and rock, and of a depth which would scarcely admit of its being classified with our deep leads. 8,300 Total population: \u2014 Europeans 19,000 Chinese 1,000 20,000 The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Over the auriferous drift, which is com posed of clay slate, sand, and gravel, is a thick bed of grey fine grained sand, mixed with clay, and highly indurated. This is the only difficult part of the sinking, but this, even, only entails a few additional shafts and a trifling expense in the steeling and repairing of .picks. Nothing particular calling for special notice has occurred at Smythesdale during the month. The whole of the deep alluvial ground there is in the possession of a few large companies, who, with economic ar rangements, are obtaining fair returns. The bottom is composed of a greenish grey micaceous sandstone. The only apprehension I entertain of the present success of this locality arises from the flat nature of the surface, and its almost uniform sameness, which scarcely exhibits any feature to judge of the locale of the lead, as compared with the surrounding country, and I fear that, should the efforts now being made prove un successful, the place will be abandoned ; no doubt, should this happen, it will have the effect of retarding the development of an ex tensive portion of auriferous country ; but I anticipate that it would be only for a short time, as there is a population now settling down at Linton's, which is not far distant, capable of exploring that vast sub-division of the district, and whose operations have already extended far in the direction of the ground now being experimented on at Mount Bute. The same may be said of Brown's and Italian workings, with the exception of the quartz reef at the head of Brown's old lead, which is turning out magnificently in the prospecting claim. At Derwent Jack's a great reduction has taken place in respect of population, on ac count of the rush to Linton's. A lease of 50 acres towards the west end of the gully has been applied for within the month. With this exception, and a block claim held by another company, operations in the gully have entirely ceased. This cessation I ap prehend will be only temporary ; as the appearance of the place presents every stature which a prospecting party need desire. Linton's and Carngham are in about the same state as during the previous months. The claims that are yielding gold, in both places, are turning out so well as to induce an amount of enterprise, and an outlay of capital and labor, which the highest and best grounded expectations alone could Within a short distance of Clarke's station a quartz reef has been discovered.

The Yankee Company have their new shaft down 140 feet, 70 feet of which is ba saltic rock, 5 feet alluvial deposits, and the remainder slate reef. They have not met with any quartz in sinking. This company have crushed during the month 360 tons, averaging If oz. to the ton. The Victoria Company have, at a depth of 275 feet, struck the eastern reef; where struck, it is six feet wide, and the quartz evidently auriferous. Owing to an unusual quantity of water in the reef, sufficient stone for a trial has not been obtained. The com pany are opening a level at 235 feet to work this reef. The machinery is as follows : The approximate value of all the mining plant within the division is \u00a385,700. Throughout this division the want of water is severely felt as well for domestic as for mining purposes, to a much greater extent than I have ever previously known it. This \u2022scarcit}7 is principally caused by an un usually dry season, but partially by the filling up of water holes and beds of creeks with sludge ; as a consequence all shallow and surface diggings are completely at a standstill. Those miners working in the wet diggings, viz., the Black Lead, White Flat, Red Streak, and Black Hill Lead pro cure sufficient water for washing purposes by bailing it from their claims. At the Bald Hill Lead another claim to the west of the Prospect Claim has been bottomed at a depth of 125 feet, averaging \u00a7 of an ounce to the load, and is the deepest shaft yet sunk. This lead would, I believe, prove a payable though not a rich one, could it be continued. There is however room for only two more claims (both of which are taken up) up to the boundary of private property, where the working must stop unless arrangements can be made with the proprietor. The companies working on the Red Streak, and the Chinese on the Black Lead are get ting fair dividends.

There is a considerable flow of water from the west in the shaft. This company have applied an additional cast iron bed plate in their batteries, one foot below the usual beat line. It adds firmness and lessens the quan tity necessary to be washed off. The Alliance Company have discontinued for the present working their northern shaft.

The Leviathan Reef is 10 feet thick on the surface, and also at a depth of 40 feet. During the past month the Union Company has commenced operations under application for lease ; and has accepted tenders for sinking a main shaft, which is now down to a depth of about 70 feet. The Steiglitz Company's engine and pump ing apparatus, on their main shaft, have, in the course of the month, made considerable progress towards completion. The engine has been at work, and the pumping will commence in a day or two. The workings in the lower portions of the ground have not been proceeded with, and what has been done is not of such importance as to justify the labor of drawings and sections. The crush ing mill of this company has been in partial operation, and is now employed in re-grinding the tailings left by the former proprietors. Though far from suitable for collecting all the gold in this refuse, being only a repetition of the operations to which they have been already submitted, in the course of four days they are able to collect from 9 to 12 oz of gold \u2014 but the loss of mercury in the opera tion, with what is already known to be in this refuse, will still admit of this material being again operated on for the gold in such mercury and metallic sulphurets. The Kangaroo Company are working at a depth of 198 feet. The reef, at that depth, is 6 feet thick. The yield of the last crushing from a depth of 85 feet (reef 4 feet thick) from 19 tons was 16J ozs. Another reef within the company's ground (Peterson's), where the original workers thought the reef had disappeared, was found a few feet to the east of the former strike, showing a very distinct cross course. Its thickness varies from 6 to 18 inches, dipping to the east and widening.

The three veins being wrought out to the slip or slide, they have, since the beginning of the year, been sinking a blind shaft on the slide. They are now down about 40 feet, and have cut various small leaders still dipping east, but have found none of the upper veins. They are not deep enough by 10 feet within the shortest dis tance that has been assigned to this slide. The \" Invincibles\" and \" Allies\" still con tinue idle. The Perseverance Company have continued idle through the month, and their ultimate intentions are not generally known. The Gibraltar Company have made still further promising progress, and the workings now extend beyond the drawings and sections many feet (vide tracing). The dip of the vein, as in the drawing, led to the supposition that it would be so deep in the ground to the north as to give little encouragement to work it. The vein has, however, taken a strong and steady rise in level No. 2, and is yielding very rich stone. In the beginning of the month they came on some very broken country \u2014 dangerous workings \u2014 ten and twenty feet of the roof falling at a time. This contained quartz yielding from 5 to 6 oz. per ton, but they are now through this ground in solid country, with a regularly formed vein, 1 foot 6 inches thick. This has yielded the best stone they have yet crushed, and, still more gratifying, the vein appears to rise far above the present works. This lower ground indicates a break, and now there is reason to hope that the vein to the north will be found to extend nearer the surface than it did in the ground already worked. Their crushing machinery has been in active operation during the month, and they are able to obtain from 45 to 50 oz. per week. This week the yield has been over 100 oz. Both for permanency and remuneration, this company's prospects are very encouraging. The Malakhoff Company continue with un abated diligence ; their quartz improves towards the north, as also the nearer they come to the surface. An assay of their pyrites, which they have lately collected, has given 7 oz. 3 dwt. to the ton, of which they are able to collect 1 cwt, in eight hours. The Sailor's Reef Company continue their operations; their crushiug apparatus is but small \u2014 only three stamper heads \u2014 and the number of mineis limited. On Birmingham Reef the quartz is still paying the Pros pect claim party well, and the last crushing was more remunerative than any previous one. They are again crushing now. The claim No. 1 south have lately crushed their quartz, but I cannot say what the result was. The only party on Boxing Reef actually mining have, during the month, had 7 oz. per ton from quartz they had left in the upper ground as not payable. They cannot work the deep ground till the pumping apparatus on the reef gets into active work. The yield from the Scotchman's Reef has not been so favorable this month, but they still continue their operations. The Redan party still con tinue their works in the upper ground, but on a small scale. This ground is nearly worked out, and there are no indications of their ultimate intentions in reference to their working the deep ground. The two parties The Albion Company still continue their preliminary operations; their works are being proceeded with in a satisfactory manner; and the quartz taken from the ground, on the newly discovered vein, north of their claim, has not yet been crushed, and further work ing of that is stayed till sufficient water comes to allow what has been raised to be tested.

The Moorabool Diggings are at present very quiet. On the Teatree Creek, however, several'large block claims have been taken up lately. I believe some of them are paying very fairly. The miners on Dolly's Creek Diggings are complaining very much of the scarcity of water. The dams are all dry, and until the rain comes they are obliged to stack their wash-dirt. Some hundreds of loads are now waiting to be puddled. I beg to enclose you two small specimens of fossil wood, acted upon by sulphuret of iron. They were taken from a large mass of petrified trunks and houghs, found at a depth of about 40 feet on the Moorabool Flat. The mass was lying under a drift of quartz and ironstone, resting on a bed of pipeclay. The depth is far below the Moorabool River, and I think this spot must have been the old river bed.

On Wednesday last, the 7th inst., the Lerderderg Company's machine com menced work for the first time. On starting the machine only one battery of 5 stamps was allowed to work, as it was found necessary to adjust the lift of two stampers in each of the three batteries, which occupied not more than ten minutes, after which the 15 stampers were set to work, and worked on steadily as if the whole machinery had been at work for months, until the supply of water was exhausted. The works are perfect and reflect credit on the contractors, who have introduced improvements in portions of the machine. Note.\u2014 The quartz crushing machines (5) are only parUally employed. The number of persons employed in quartz mining, I estimated, after having visited the Trewhella's Reef is again all activity.

The number of alluvial miners I estimated from my own observations of the numbers employed on the various the various workings. I cannot report satisfactorily on any branch of mining in this division owing to the scarcity of water. No new alluvial ground has been opened, and the majority of alluvial miners are fossicking until the rainy season sets in. Simmon's Reef. \u2014 The Imperial Company's works are at a stand still, and the proprietors are endeavouring to form a local company. On Yankee Reef, the Falkirk and Norwood Company have abandoned their original claim on account of the reef having gradually run nearly out, not being more than 3 inches wide. The company not being in a position to search for a wide and better portion of reef, are now prospecting the south end of the Ph\u0153nix Company's claim. The Ph\u0153nix and Eureka Companies' works are at a stand still. The Crown Company are working at a depth of 100 feet in their west shaft, and at a depth of 150 feet in their south shaft. At a depth of 70 feet in the west shaft, the reef runs down perpendicularly to a depth of 100 feet. The perpendicular portion of the reef having yielded highly satisfactory returns, the company have been induced to carry in a level from the south shaft to strike the per pendicular portion of the reef at a depth of 150 feet. The portion of the reef lying between the depth of 100 and 150 feet has a dip of about 8 degrees west, the appearance of which is not so satisfactory as the perpen dicular portion of the reef. The Crown Company are at present erecting a new machine to be worked by steam power. The Cornish Company have sunk and cross cut the reef at the same level the Crown Company are working on, but the prospects obtained do not promise so satisfactorily as the Crown Company's. The Early Bird Company, on Johnson's Reef, have not yet succeeded in getting their machine in good working order, which I think is in a great measure attributable to the fact of the Company having commenced crushing before the machinery was ready. The Early Bird Company have now about 150 tons of stone ready for crushing, which is expected to yield renumeratively. The Golden Point Company's claim has during the months of January and February, yielded very little, not covering expenses. The quartz at present being raised is however looking better, and a far larger yield is anti cipated. This company are erecting four more stampers. The Simmon's Reef Quartz Mining Com pany have also cross cut the reef at a depth of 250 feet (their shaft being to the base 262 feet). In cross cutting the reef, which is about 8 feet thick, it did not present a more favorable appearance than the generality of the former workings have done, but on Friday evening last some rich stone was struck in working the level along the course The Hit or Miss, and the Criterion com panies' are still sinking ; the former are about 115 and the latter about 68 feet deep.

BEECHWORTH MINING DISTRICT. Snake Valley & Yackandaniiaii Division (Thomas G. Kennan, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Spring Creek Division. (Henry Grimes, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 There are 7 puddling mills\u2014 5 at work, and 2 idle\u2014 all in the Nine-mile Division. The population at Beechworth, by the po lice returns, is 1,800. The Chinese population has greatly in- creased since my last report, as will be seen by the tables, chiefly in the Nine-mile Divi- sion. The Europeans, as may also be seen by the table, have greatly decreased, princi- pally in the Yackandandah Division, which, as stated in my last report, is owing to the exodus to the Snowy River, or Kiandra gold field. For the greater part of the month the continuance of extreme dry weather had the effect of almost putting a stop to mining operations in both the above-named divisions, but very few parties being enabled to work full time, but during the last four daj's of the month a very heavy and continuous rain took place which gave, for the time, a good supply of water ; in fact, in some instances rather too much, as some of the creek claims were completely flooded. The cause of this is in a great measure owing to the miners not making their flood races of sufficient capacity to carry off the large body of water which flows down the creek after even a heavy thunderstorm, Shou'd the wet weather continue, all kinds of workings will most likely be vigorously proceeded with. Another great drawback to our progress here has been the discovery of the Snowy River or Kiandra gold field, numbers of persons having left these divisions (chiefly from Yackandandah) to try their fortunes on the new rush. In consequence of this, many parts of the Yackandandah Creek, particularly Kirby's Flat, Allan's Flat, and the lower portions of the creek are nearly deserted. Even should the new gold field prove payable, I do not think that eventually it will interfere with the prosperity of these diggings ; as on account of the ex- treme cold, and the great depth of snow in that part of the country parties cannot mine there during the winter, which is the time of year when most work can be done in these districts ; so that parties will be enabled to leave here when their supply of water is getting short, and be obliged to leave there just at the period when water becomes plen- tiful here. No new works of any importance Note. \u2014 Mr. Grimes does not give the number of miners employed, in accordance with the instructions, but ap parently the total male population. A considerable number of our miners have been leaving for the Snowy River Diggings, more especially those who were working for wages, or who had not comparative perma nent claims. We have had one very heavy fall of rain in the month, amounting to between 1 and 2 inches, and of considerable benefit in soften ing the soil as well as for a supply of water. The accompanying plan is a continuation of that I sent for the month of December. Very few miners are upon this part of the creek at present, although I think there is plenty of ground fit for working. The greater part of -the banks on the left side of the creek are auriferous on the surface, and several parties of Chinese are sluicing from 1 to 3 feet in depth of surface. The quantity of water available regulates the amount of labor employed. Considerable quantities of black sand (or tin ore) are found in all the washings of these banks, and in fact wherever the bed rock, and ranges are granite. The F.I Dorado Diggings are progressing favorably ; but sinking shafts in the sand to a depth of 100 feet is a tedious and expensive operation. At Bowman's Forest the prospect of good wages is believed in by the miners there. Several non-payable shafts have been sunk, which has delayed the finding of the lead and prevented the rest of the parties from setting to work. The district is in a quiet, steady working order, and with the exception of those who are going to the Snowy River, without excitement of any kind. The dis trict could readily, I believe, give employ ment to double or treble its population, more especially if the rain-fall of the district was to be collected and stored. J Europeans.

Those mentioned in my former reports are progressing favorably. 1 forward herewith two plans \u2014 one a por tion of the Nine-mile Creek, and the other a portion of the Yackandandah Creek. In claim No 7, on the Nine-mile plan, the party are doing extremely well , although the ground has been nearly all worked before ; yet at present they are making, as they informed me, from \u00a320 to \u00a330 per man per week. Formerly this ground was sunk on and driven out, but the present party strip or paddock it, by which means they are enabled to pick up thoroughly the bed rock, which they do to the depth in some places of 7 feet, and find it to pay for washing even at that depth. The bottom is chiefly sandstone, with some slate intermixed. All the claims marked on this plan are paying good wages, some more than wages, according to the facilities enjoyed by the parties working them. The holders of No. 9 and 10 claims are obliged to wheel their dirt to the creek, consequently the labor expenses come heavy and reduce the amount of clear gain. The puddlers, having but a short distance to wheel the dirt, and that being a more efficient plan of washing the soil which is here of a very clayey nature, are better paid for their labor. The greater portion of this ground has been taken up by the Ovens Water Company for the formation of their reservoir, and with a good head of water will pay well for sluicing out. On the plan of the Yackandandah Creek, the tail race marked No. 6 is one of the extensive tail races mentioned in a former The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Note. \u2014 There is one quartz crushing machine in course of erection. Mr. Thornely states that there are fifteen engines at work, of the aggregate of 163 horse-power; he does not say whether or not all the whims aud whips are employed. There is little to report this month in re gard to most of the leads upon this gold field. On the Chiltern Lead the Alliance and Township Companies, have been compelled to sink new shafts in consequence of the great distance of the lead from the shafts first sunk. This together with the great quantity of water to contend against, retards mining operations on this lead. The lower part of the Suffolk Lead is still paying well, partly because the claims pro duce sufficient water for washing purposes, and the thickness of wash-dirt. Glasgow Lead mentioned in my January report has but few good claims upon it, the wash-dirt not averaging more than about 14 dwt. to the cart load. Italian Lead. \u2014 A few claims are still at work below the prospectors, and averaging about loz. to the load. report, that of Pierre Boune and party. It has, up to the present time, cost about \u00a3900 for labor, \u00a3100 for tools, and \u00a3100 for boxes, making a total of \u00a31100, and will, when finished, cost about \u00a31200. It is cut through very hard slate rock, in some parts over 9 feet, and boxed for the length of 300 yards with boxes 16 in. by 16 in., set flush with a fall of barely 2 in. to the box, almost too little, in my opinion, to run well. Sebastopol Lead referred .to in the July report as having been abandoned, is now re occupied by fresh parties, and prospects have been obtained, which promise a yield of more than an ounce to the load, and a number of shafts are now being sunk. Stanly and Skeleton Leads are now quite abandoned, not having been found payable. Scotchman's Lead is only now being worked in three (3) shafts, with no very encouraging results. On the Main Lead, Indigo, below Polis prospecting shaft, three claims have struck very payable gold, and the lead though not so rich, as was first anticipated, appears to satisfy the claimholders. Below where there is supposed to be a junction with the Cale donian Lead, the water continues very heavy, necessitating in the Hit or Miss Claims the employment of a more powerful engine than the one first erected by the company. It will be a considerable time before this part of the lead can be fairly proved. Caledonian Lead is now, with the excep tion of the lower claims about the supposed junction with the Durham, principally in the hands of the Chinese, who by taking a Indigo Division. (Thomas E.

Durham Lead has proved good in most of the claims, the dirt in many averaging 2 oz. to the cart load. This division, owing to the scarcity of water, has remained in a dormant state throughout the month. We had a little rain towards the latter part of the month, but nothing of consequence, merely giving in one or two places a few days supply of water. Quartz mining is becoming more and more developed, and the operations are more sys tematic. Now that the miners see daily sub stantial results, the fruits of perseverance and enterprise combined with system, hitherto unknown amongst us, and new reefs being opened daily with brilliant prospects as shown by the specimens exhibited, claims are becoming more and more valuable, and it would be difficult to find out an unoccupied spot on any well-known line of reef.

Up wards of 1000 puddlers, &c, and a few quartz reefers have gone to Inglewood rush, which is distant only 25 miles from Bendigo by the bush. Kincardineshire Lead is now nearly proved to the upper part of the Durham. Many of the claims are good, yielding 2 oz. to the load, and from the rapidity with which it can be worked, being dry and comparatively shallow it is likely to prove very remunera tive. Quartz. \u2014 Several new leaders have been opened; some of them are paying well. As this branch of mining is attracting more at tention, it is probable that some of the reefs will get a fair testing. The rain which fell in the early part of this month produced a good supply of water, and washing operations are being carried on vigorously. The new diggings reported at the Snowy Mountains, New South Wales, at present attract great numbers of miners from this district, and it is more than probable that many more will leave next Spring. Many of our steam gold washing companies are now ready for operations, and only wait for the first fall of rain to make a start. Some of these intend using the common puddling mill, on an improved principle, instead of Hart's patent, and others intend erecting powerful engines and passing all the stuff under a number of stamps (similar to a quartz mill) of light weight, to crush stones, clay, and everything likely to contain gold. This last method, in my opinion, will prove to be the best and most economical, being more compact, and requiring less water.

Several other claims are spiritedly at work, endeavoring to find the same body of stone. Glasgow Reef. \u2014 This line is becoming brisker, as the pumping engine approaches completion. Several new claims have struck gold in the stone above water. Lane's pro specting claim yielded 1 oz. per ton. Fagg, and Company, crushed 10 tons, giving 90 oz. Ness and Company, 5 tons, giving 35 oz. Other claims have good stone. On Cape Clear Reef, Long Gully, some very rich stone was discovered some time ago in Messrs, Roberts' claim. The pumping engines on the Victoria Reef are constantly at work, and already begin to be effective. On the Redan Reef Mr. Cooper has erected a powerful engine for crushing and pumping. Mr. Cooper intends to drive across at every 60 feet to those lines of reef running parallel with the Redan, as Hussler's and Maiden Reefs.

From about twenty to twenty-five men are employed on the works in addition to contractors in the bush cutting timber, firewood, &c. The erection of these works has caused quite a little village to be brought into existence in'their vicinity, on a spot that but a few months since was silent bush, and should the company succeed in finding the ground payable it is likely that a permanent community will be established. The Alluvial Steam Puddling Companies are in some cases ready to commence opera tions, and more will no doubt be ready to begin by the time that they have water in their dams. The head of the lirle at Huntly is still progressing to the northward although some holes have been sunk more to the westward and some of the miners are of opinion that it will take that course and cross the Old Ben digo Creek at a point further north. They still appear to have great hopes of a good return from the washing stuff which they continue to raise and store in anticipation of water. The Crushing and Pumping Companies are advancing with their works. Among which I may mention the Prince of Wales Company, they have just put up a twenty-five horse power engine with twenty-four stamps; at present they are raising between three and four hundred tons of stone per week, and employ about twenty men ; they are now waiting for water, but when in full work they will give employment to about sixty persons in all. The Catharine Reef Claimholders Pumping Company have also made considerable ad vancement having just finished theirehimney, and will soon be ready to pump the water from the reef more effectually than they are now doing by means of a whim. The Bagshot Steam Crushing Company are making great advances towards the comple tion of their well appointed works. The ground belonging to this company is pur chased land, situate at about ten miles from Sandhurst. I send a small tracing of the locality showing the site of the plant and workings. They have two shafts, one the engine and drawing shaft, the depth of which is one hundred and three feet ; from whence it has been sunk thirty feet in the slate and a drive prosecuted westward for one hundred and fifty feet, thus forming a main level for drawing the cement to the engine shaft. The other, or westerly shaft (not used at present) is very useful in creating a current of air through the works below, and is one hundred and seven feet deep. Water was struck at ninety-four feet from the surface, which is kept under by a fourteen horse-power engine, to which is also applied the winding gear re quired for raising the cement, &c. These shafts are finished in a very superior manner being boxed throughout and divided into two compartments by a partition from top to bot tom. The cement is now being excavated in both a northerly and westerly direction, averaging about two feet in thickness.

Reedy Creek. \u2014 I have no improvements to report in mining matters during the past month, numbers of the quartz claims still being registered, and many alluvial miners having left for Inglewood and the Snowy River diggings. It is the opinion of many experienced miners in this district that many of the veins which have run out are only leaders, and that a greater depth will have to be attained before the main reef is struck.

On the Strath Creek almost all the reefs are either registered or abandoned, the returns from them not having at all come up to the expectations formed. So little, indeed, is doing there, that the crushing machinery, only lately erected, at a very considerable expense, has been removed. King Parrot Creek. \u2014 On this creek some few of the claims are yielding a fair return, but the gold is of a very poor quality, being worth at most \u00a32 15s. by assay. The claim at the extreme north end of Whittaker's line gave at the rate of 2 oz. per ton. This is the most northerly claim on these diggings, and immediately joins the Sugar Loaf Hill. Water still prevails in many of the claims, and I am of opinion that these reefs will never be profitably wrought, except by co operative labor, or by companies with a good capital. By far the greater number of claims on this creek are registered, the water proving too strong for ordinary parties At Yea a very decided improvement has taken place in the reefs which are situate immediately opposite the junction of the Boundary and Muddy Creeks. The Carriers' Reef bearing N 60\u00b0 W, and underlying at an angle of about 55\u00b0 from the horizon, has yielded a very good return, \u2014 viz., 6^ oz. per ton from a large body of stone. The Pro vidence Reef, bearing N 47\u00b0 W, situate about 4 chains north from the last-mentioned reef, and on the same spur, presents an extremely good appearance. The underlay of this reef is about 70\u00b0 to the east. I saw a stone broken from this reef at a depth of about 25 feet, which was well studded with rough gold ; as a general rule the gold in these reefs is the coarsest I have seen in the district. and othei reefs a large quantity of stone awaits crushing, and until returns have been realized from the quartz already raised, this place will never receive a fair trial, as many parties having payable claims are compelled to register for want of funds. The alluvial miners on this creek are still doing pretty well, the best yield I have heard of being about 2 dwt. to the tub, with three feet stripping, aud a good thickness of wash-dirt. The sluicing party lately at work in the Muddy Creek, near Mr. Lush's, have been compelled to abandon their claim, owing to the late rains. They were working the bed of the creek by means of a wing dam, but, I believe, it will be necessary to turn the bed of the creek before a fair trial can be obtained. Heathcote Division (John Breen, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The claims on the Ready Money Reef are all registered, owing principally to the want of funds ; very good specimens have, how ever, been obtained from this line. The machinery erected by Mr. Lanktree will be shortly at work, and Air. Sloane, from Strath Creek, has brought his machine on to the Muddy Creek, immediately adjoining the reefs. Notf. \u2014 Mr. Breen's table does not show clearly whether the whims are used in quartz or alluvial mining. The statistics regarding the number of alluvial miners can be detei mined with very little accuracy, in consequence of the num bers incessantly leaving for the new diggings at lnglewood. The above is an approxima tion of the daily average actually engaged in mining during the month. The portion of ground on the Mclvor Creek, to which the late rush had been, is now nearly worked out. It amply remune rated those who had claims there, and. in some instances, nuggets varying between 3 and 7 oz. were found. A few of those at present working there speak with compara- At the Junction matters have been much retarded by the want of water for crushing purposes; the reefs, however, are still looking well, and Messrs. Williamson and Bruntine's machine will be shortly at work. Alluvial gold has been found on the flat, at a depth of between 30 and 40 feet, yielding, I under stand, about 1 dwt. to the tub. On the Teatree the reefs still give a good show of gold, but the want of crushing ma chroeiy is much felt, the machine at work there being fully occupied crushing from the claim of the proprietors.

This division, as well as others, contributes a share of the vast population now at Ingle wood. and of course in the same proportion as our mining population is being draughted, a corresponding dullness is sure to prevail iu our mining operations. Cockatoo is the only place in this division where the miners during this very unusual dry weather can wash their washing stuff. The water from the shaft of the Caledonian Company supplies neatly all the puddling machines here at a very trifling cost, aud if required could supply more. The engine being at a considerable, elevation above the adjoining gully, hence the water listed speedily runs to any part of the gully. It is to be regretted, that the other old workings are not so favorably situated with respect to water as Cockatoo. I send a tracing of these diggings, which is connected with the south-east angle of the ground about being leased to the Caledonian Company. Another powerful under current of water is also discovered in the claims on England's Hill frontage lead, numbering from six up wards. \u2014 {See tracing). In the shafts of these claims the water rises to within ten feet of the surface, nearly on the same level with the bed of the creek, and although without the aid of machinery it cannot be made avai'able for mining purposes, yet it affords proof that in this locality almost any quantity of water can be obtained within a few feet of the surface. In this frontage lead gold has been traced as far as No. 7 ; but reports from Inglewood have eclipsed every thing here for the present, and therefore the ground is abandoned. In No. 3 the washing stuff is from 2 to 3 feet in thickness, composed of white clay, gravel, and boulders. It recently yielded 27 oz. 10 dwt. out of 61 loads. tive certainty of the lead being traced in the adjoining private property, and complain of their being interdicted from working therein. That part of the Camp Reserve thrown open for mining did not equal the anticipa tions of the miners who sought for claims ; nor were there as many claims taken up as was expected. The maximum yield, confined to a few miners, was 1| oz. to the load. A prospecting association has just been formed by the inhabitants of Heathcote, for the purpose of ascertaining the auriferous character of many of the gullies which have not been previously opened, as well as the promotion of the further development of those that have been. Nothing of the kind has been done before, and it is to be hoped that the objects of the association will be attended with succass. Quartz reefing appears to be making some slight progress. ' The Caledonian Reef continues to be worked steadily, and the yield rather uni form ; the quantity crushed during the month was 3yJ tons, which yielded 205 oz. The Hibernian Reef, one lately opened, gave nearly 5 oz. to the ton. Some new reefs are being worked about seven miles from Heathcote, and notwith standing the expenses incurred in drawing the materials to Heathcote for crushing, the remuneration to the prospectors was beyond mediocrity.

As was mentioned in my report for December, 1859, respecting the Black Lead, the Union, where it was supposed to join the Black Lead, is being slowly re occupied. Two gutters are known to exist, and, perhaps, following the lead from where it at present is known towards the south, instead of commencing both ends at once, may prove the safer method of carrying the lead to its termination. Rocky Flat. \u2014 Although partially deserted for Inglewood this lead is still held in tole rably high estimation, as many as ten of the deserted claims having been re-occupied within a short time after their desertion. The quantity of water on the lead has been reduced sufficiently to enable the miners to cross and prove the value of the deep ground, as in most cases in this locality the deep ground is not the best. The gold generally lies on the western side of the gutters that have a northerly di rection, heavy gold especially being very seldom found in the lowest part of the de posit. Rocky Lead, at the end of Scandinavian Lead, does not at present bear a very pros perous appearance, owing to the hardness and depth of the sinking, aud the greater attractions of the shallow ground at Lamp lough and Inglewood. Those parties how ever who remain are making good wages generally. At a future period a junction of the two above-named leads may be looked for, but at the present rate of sinking a con siderable time may elapse before such fact will have been proved. Scandinavian Lead still continues to yield large quantities of auriferous cement, which, however, there is much danger in obtaining, owing to the shaken nature of the granite (?) which has settled down to such a degree that removing the debris left by the original workers is equal to driving through the original bed rock. It is a matter of doubt whether, where there is such a mass of ba saltic rock as on some parts of this lead, the mass of ground actually sinks, or the soft schistose rock expands, and so presses up ward. It could easily be ascertained,' if of any scientific utility, by establishing two bench marks at the commencement of opera tions, where the ground presents similar features to those on this lead, and ascertain ing the exact depth of some of the shafts when sunk in the rock. Black Lead. \u2014 The claims in the neighbor hood of the crushing machines are in full work, but this only for the purpose of bailing water to keep the machinery at work, the owners being compelled, in consequence of the continued dryness of the season, to employ labor for that purpose. Mysterious Lead is still deserted. No at tempt has been made to recommence ope rations here. Hard Hill Flat. \u2014 A lease of about eleven acres, embracing nearly the whole flat, has just been granted, and operations will com mence in March by shareholders, who are all working men. The ground is old, and com pletely saturated with water, and, although shallow, great difficulty will be experienced in working it to advantage, in consequence of the existence of a stratum of porous gravel below the water level, through which the water percolates over the whole extent of the flat. Hard Hill. \u2014 A lease of three acres, and another of ten acres three roods and fifteen perches, have been applied for. The Hill is completely\u2014 as far as the ground applied for goes \u2014 hollowed out. The cement which re mains contains gold, and to obtain the cement for crushing is the object of the applicants. Experience teaches that, with machinery, if the ground be systematically worked, opera tions will prove remunerative. Kangaroo Flat, Kangaroo Gully, Nuggetty Gully, Long Gully. Star Flat, White Hill, Chapel Hill (Back Creek), Red Hill, Good Woman's Hill, Cowley's Gully, Mia Mia Flat, and all the old workings are occupied by only a few persons each. The want of water is felt even in the old workings, in the holes and drives of which it generally lodges for a considerable period \u2014 to this fact may be at tributed the almost total desertion of the old ground. Quartz Reefs. \u2014 The reef mentioned in the December report as known to exist at about thirty feet from the surface has not been struck ; owing to the quantity of water in the old ground, with which it is surrounded, the search for the present has been aban doned. This reference to the water may appear a contradiction to the above, but the Union Lead. \u2014 At the northern end the parties are at work night and day, which is an indication that they are being remunerated.

Alluvial mining in the division has been almost at a stand 3till during the month, the poorness of the old diggings (no new ground having been opened during the month) and the almost entire want of water, have caused a great number of alluvial miners to leave for Inglewood. The only two companies of any extent in the division in alluvial mining, have been unsuccessful, viz. \u2014 the Black Ball Company, near Burnt Creek, who have aban doned their claim, and the No 1 Company on the Dunolly, West Lead, who after eighteen months constant work, (during which time they have not paid expenses) are prospecting some reef, with the view of abandoning their present ground, and going into quartz mining. Quartz mining is the only permanent source of production in the division, and this branch is steadily improving, but scarcely any quartz has been crushed during the month for want of water. The old reefs are being steadily worked with their average success, and some of the new ones are turning out beyond ex pectation. The Hellas Reef, for instance, on which five claims are now getting gold, and the yield is expected to be from 12 to 15 oz. per ton, aud a great quantity is ready to be crushed. localities are very different, and three miles apart. On Chapel Hill Reef\u2014 situated on Chapel Hill, Amherst \u2014 a few parties are at work, and indications show that probably next month's report of it will be favorable. Some have registered their claims, but will, it is thought, resume them before the term of registration expires. Morning Star Reef, Camp Reserve, has not come up to the expectations that were formed of it, if one may judge from the difficulty existing to find the reef, and the desire on the part of the owners of claims to register them. Mia Mia Reef. \u2014 There are only a few claims at work, and the yields from them are not very renumerative. All Nations Reef is completely deserted, towards the south, in which direction a lease of three acres has been applied for. Only four claims are in work towards the north, and the yield from either of them does not exceed one ounce to the ton. The depth at tained is one hundred and thirty feet. The reef at this depth begins to get humid, indi cating that at a few feet deeper water will be struck, when machinery will be required. Victoria Reef lying in a westerly direction from Back Creek, is deserted. The lowest depth attained is 80 feet, and water is already met with ; two of the claims are registered, the Prospecting, and the one adjoining it on the north. This reef is likely to rival the far-famed Poverty Reef. Three leasehold companies are now at work, viz., the Poverty Reef, Stony Reef, and the Greeks' Hill Company. The Stony Reef Company have got out, and are burning about 300 tons of quartz. This mine is under the management of Mr. Nichoils, a thorough practical miner. The plans forwarded are plans and sections of the Hellas Reef, Sandy Creek. The lon gitudinal section shows in red the amount of reef excavated. The vertical dotted lines show the boundary walls between the claims, which by the regulations are five feet thick. The transverse sections show how the reef underlies, and how the timbering is fixed. The timbers in these mines are generally about 3^ feet apart, longitudinally, and about 4J to 5 feet apart vertically, and from 6 to 9 inches in diameter, with the bark on and placed as shown in No. 1. The whole of the \"deads,\" a3 well as the quartz, have been brought to the surface. The former would have been stowed away in hulls had practical mineis been working the ground, saving a great deal of labor; besides, the hanging wall would have been better supported. No. I also shows how all the shafts are logged up on the surface, also the disposal of the \"deads\" or mullock. In none of these shafts are there any means of ascent or descent but by the rope, and everything is dragged up the incline at a great expense of labor. Donoli.y Division. (R. J.

The deepest shaft yet on Inglewood is on this reef, viz. : about 140 feet, at which depth it is perfectly dry and hard. Good quartz is being taken from several of the other reefs, the positions of which I expect soon to be able to lay before you. There is yet no crush ing machine erected for this field which pre vents many of the quartz miners from proving the value of their quartz. The great scarcity of water in this large auriferous district is attracting the attention of capitalists and several propose to introduce a supply by machinery from the Loddon, an investment sure to prove remunerative and is unworthy of the delay which has already occurred. (John Catto, Mining Surveyor. i as follows : \u2014 The population is There are 2 steam engines at work and 4 idle, there is 1 crushing machine at work and 4 idle, there are 7 puddling machines at work and 49 idle, and there are 2 steam engines in course of erection. The great scarcity of water throughout the whole district is severely felt by the entire population, and a general dullness prevails in all the old diggings. There has been no rain during the last five and a half months, and water for domestic use, &c, has to be carted a distance of six or seven miles to Korong, Jericho, Inglewood, &c. Inglewood continues the chief spot of at traction in the district, owing to the quantity of auriferous ground being discovered in places miles apart. The population now may be estimated at 16.000, which number is being daily augmented, as departures and com plaints are seldom heard of, it may be con sidered that the prospects of the majority are good. On the eastern side of the \" Mallee Scrub\" the population is about 13,000. A street about 2,000 yards long, chiefly occupied by business people is the principal centre. Owing to the Mining Bye-laws of the district, no protection is afforded to those holding business sites fronting on unsurveyed road, bo that great confusion and a many disputes are of daily occurrence with the miners through their digging up the main road and frontages. The hard sinking adjoining is now being worked to a depth of about seventy feet, and is extending towards the Loddon with payable results. A deal of shepherding is resorted to. It is very difficult to obtain correct information as to the yield of gold obtained from any claim, I hear frequently of from 4 oz. to 10 oz. per load being obtained, aud in several instances I know such has been found ; also of a nugget weighing over 11 Ibs. having been got lately. The deep, or old lead at the original township is reviving gradually, and will yet be found to contain a deal of payable if not of rich ground. Two more surface quartz reefs have been found during the month, showing indica tions of being highly auriferous. On the Inglewood Reef several of the claimholders registered their shares owing to the great excitement at the alluvial workings, others The district has never contained so large a population as at present, and should the en suing winter be an ordinary wet one, the yield of gold from this district will be equal to any in the colony. There is nothing new in any other portion of the district, all the fields are suffering from the great scarcity of water as at Inglewood. CASTLEMAINE MINING DISTRICT. Castlemaine Division. (Thomas Lawrence Brown, Mining Surveyor.) The approximate population is 12,000 ; an accurate table cannot be given, in consequence of the unsettled condition of the mining popu lation. There are only 62 puddling machines being worked, and only 8 of the steam crushing machines have sufficient water, consequently gieat quantities of auriferous earth and stone are being stacked, awaiting rain. The continued drought has almost sus pended mining operations, and, as there is no immediate prospect of change, those miners who can raise the means are leaving for Inglewood and Lamplough. The only workings approaching stahilityare the quartz reefs, and of these only such claims as are proved to be payable. None of our alluvial companies are success ful just now. The Argus F^lat Company, which has been the best company in the district, has worked out its lease, disposed of its plant, and divided the proceeds. The Caledonian Company still remains idle, and the Chewton Sluicing Company is as unsuc cessful as ever. By the failure of these companies Hart's patent crushing machines have fallen into disuse, and are now valued only as old iron.

The late escort returns show the regular yield of our quartz reefs, which, with the Chinese alluvial gold, gives the principal supply. I append returns (since my last report) from a few claims'and reefs: \u2014 Owing to the long continued dry weather, mining matters in general have not been very brisk, with the exception of Kidd's Gully, where a number of first-rate claims are still being worked. In quartz mining 1 have to report the dis covery of two new reefs. Emerald Reef, be tween Stony Creek and Lanky Gully, and Pioneer Reef in Forty Feet, Yandoit; and in both cases the prospecting claims look very promising. A number of claims on both reefs have been marked, and the holders are busy prospecting; but the discoveries are quite recent, and I have not learnt whether any other parties than the prospectors have been successful as yet. From the old reefs very few crushings have taken place, as most of the machines have for some time been at a standstill for want of water. On an average the yield has not exceeded a couple of ounces, but even that is very satisfactory. From Nuggetty Reef, Connell's Gull}', a lot of stone produced 6 oz. per ton, and a lot from another claim upwards of 2 oz. by an average thickness of 3 feet of quartz. From an abandoned reef, named the Bee hive Reef, near Dry Diggings Gully, lately taken up by John Thomas and Company, I am informed that a vein of great richness has been struck, and the owners reckon upon 20 or 30 ozs. per ton ; but the only machine in the neighborhood, Mr. Wilson's, in Middleton Creek, is not in operation, and the quartz is therefore being stacked. This reef is shown on plan la east, furnished 13th August, 1859, and I mentioned at that time my conviction, that here as in several other instances a sys tematic prospect could not fail proving suc cessful. * Including 2 tons\u2014 207 oz. ; and 5 tons \u2014 346 oz. 4 dwt.

The mining population is as follows : \u2014 The Cosmopolitan Company, on Commis sioners' Reef, have at a depth of 100 feet, en countered water, so as to compel them to suspend operations, while making arrange ments for the erection of a whim, or other bailing machinery. They have prospected the quartz at different levels and from 10 to 19 dwts. per ton has been obtained; the width of the reef varying from 5 to 10 feet. The Yandoit Quartz Mining Company, having for some time been at a standstill for want of water, have sunk a well to obtain a supply for the machine, and I believe, have just resumed operations. On Christmas Reef, the deepest shaft is 80 feet, and in different veins such prospects have been obtained as to induce the parties to continue sinking for a proper reef, which is expected to be struck at 100 feet. Malcolm's Reef, in private land, 40 feet is still turning out satisfactory, but water having been struck, I understand that ar rangments are being made for the erection of bailing and crushing machinery.

The Specimen Hill Quartz Mining Com pany having applied for a lease of upwards of 7 acres of ground on the Specimen Hill, near Wombat Creek, is in a far advanced state, and shares to the amount of \u00a33000 have been taken up in the division, shows great faith in the undertaking, and I have no doubt that with judicious management, this reef will pay a handsome return. In puddling and sluicing I have no means to report, nearly all claims being registered for want of water, and the few puddling claims at present being worked, have only water for a day or two a week, and as the shaft, under these circumstances, generally is picked, the yield cannot serve to give an idea of the average productiveness of the claim. A number of parties are prospecting for ground for the winter, repairing and cleaning out races, and otherwise employed making preparations for the wet season. The creek beds are nearly altogether taken up by Chinamen, who by saving the night water in dams across the creeks manage to get a few hour's work in the day ; but, although the gronnd has been worked over so often, still the Chinese seem to be quite satisfied with the proceeds. In tunnelling no news of interest has come to my knowledge, as no fresh ground has been opened, but the want of water is not so severely felt in this branch of mining as in any other; most of the tunnels affording sufficient water to puddle their stuff, and the rest pile it for the winter. Elevated plains on Spring Creek, and Italian Hill on Wombat Creek, are the principal hills being worked by tunnels, and on Fiery and Sebastopol Hills, Deep Creek, most of the old lead has lately been taken up to be worked from tunnels. The Ballaarat Gold Mining Company has commenced working back, facing out the gutter, and is, I believe, doing very well. In alluvial sinking the principal scene of action is on Whitehead's Lead, at the head of Kidd's Gully, where average parties on the lead are doing exceedingly well. In the rest of our old gullies a few tub aud cradle men are making a living ; but our main resources are puddling and sluicing, and when the water supply fails much cannot be expected. In Yandoit, King William's Gully is literally swarming with Chinamen, who, if report speaks true, are 'doing remarkably well, and in Nuggetty and adjacent gullies good patches are now and again discovered in the old ground. The Inglewood Forest rush has not been without effect upon our mining population, a large number of miners having their claims here registered, taking advantage of the dry season to have a trip up the country, from whence, I have no doubt, the majority will be back with the winter.

In reporting upon the state of mining affairs, in the St. Andrew's division for the month of February, I beg to state that there is rather an appearance of improvement than otherwise. The yield of gold from the old worked creeks and gullies, is, as far as I can learn, about the same as it has been for some time past, and this taken with the recent dis covery and working of a gold field at Morang, and a rush that has taken place in YAnkee Jim's Creek, on the Britannia gold field, should raise the total of gold above the average of several months past. With reference to the discovery of gold at Morang, it was, when I visited that locality, confined to one gully running through section 13 of that parish, and falling into the left bank of the River Plenty at a point nearly due east from the Morang Pound.

They are now constructing their lower dam, and preparing the site for their pumping machinery, part of which is on the ground, and will probably be in full operation within a month from this date. On the Britannia gold field several parties are doing very well at a point on lankee Jim's Creek, about five miles from the Yarra, and at the junction of the clayslate with the granite. The average sinking is about four feet ; first through about a foot of rich soil, and the remainder through granite drift. The gold is shotty, with small nuggets of from one to three dwt., and appears rather dark colored. along the Upper Plenty Road to the Half way House in Morang, from which there is a track to the workings. The distance from Melbourne is about 16 miles. The sinking varies from 4J to 8 feet, through from 1 to 2 feet of rich soil; the remainder is a yellow clay with fragments of hard green and grey shale slightly micaceous, and fragments of highly furruginous quartz and rounded peb bles of hematite. The washing stuff is a bluish clay, with rounded and water-worn pebbles of hematite and other ironstones, and almost totally devoid, of quartz, resting on hard grey and greenish shale, slightly micaceous, and se parating into rubbly fragments. I have exa mined the tailings from several tubs of wash ing stuff taken from claims that have been pretty rich, but could not discern a single particle of quartz, nothing but ironstone with some fragments of shale. I am, therefore, induced to believe, that the ironstones of this locality are highly auriferous. Some of the hills on the left bank of this gully are thickly strewn with fragments of quartz, having all the appearance of being auriferous, and I believe that good surfacing would be found on those hills. Thin veins of ferruginous quartz are also to be found in the outcropping rocks on the right bank of the gully. I have carefully examined this part of the country and have no doubt that a gold field will be found between the Diamond Creek and the Plenty, and extending north to the Dividing Range. The number of miners at work on the Morang gold field is about sixty Europeans and two Chinese. Attention is again being turned towards the Britannia Creek, where I have no doubt extensive and profitable workings would be carried on if stores were established, so as to obviate the necessity of the miners carrying their provisions on their backs eveiy week across four miles of difficult country. Quartz Mining. \u2014 At One Tree Hill some exceedingly rich quartz has been taken from the prospect claim on Swedish Reef at a depth of 65 feet ; and contrary to expecta tion the gold at this depth seems to be run ning south and dipping with the contour of the bill. Messrs. Holmes, Randle, and Rickards are pushing on their mining operations on their leasehold at One Tree Hill, with considerable vigor. Since they commenced, about two months ago, they have put down three shafts, the aggregate of which is 145 feet, besides 3 feet of 6 by 4 tunnel. In the shafts they are following the quartz veins down ; but in the tunnel they have not met with any quartz yet. I herewith forward drawings illustrative of my division. The character of the gold deposit is patchy, and the gold varies from shotty to nuggetty. I have seen some pieces weighing from 2 to about 5 dwt., and have heard of nuggets having been lound there weighing from two to three ounces.

BALLAARAT MINING DISTRICT. the Old Gully is shallow, varying from six to sixteen feet, which is principally composed of red gravel and loamy clay, and the gold seems to be equally distributed through it, so that the whole of it has to be washed, consequently a large supply of water is indispensably necessary. The bed-rock is principally slate, and of that peculiar character which is met with in the neighborhood of rich deposits. There are at present three surfacing companies at work ; one of these is about to erect steam puddling machines. No. 1 Division. (Robert Davidson, Mining Surveyor.) During the past month mining operations have been carried on with tolerable energy at Campbell's Diggings. The want of a suf ficient supply of water has hitherto been a cause of considerable delay and inconvenience in this locality, but now that the rainy season appears to have fairly set in, and the miners at Campbell's having wisely made provision during the dry season for conserving the rains which are now falling, by constructing large dams, I have no doubt that they will be enabled to secure a plentiful supply of water and that they will be thereby enabled to thoroughly prospect the ground, the result of which, I have every reason to believe, will be highly satisfactory. The ground in The quartz reefs in this locality form a prominent feature, and have a fair chance of being tested during the winter. Sago Hill.\u2014 Mining here is progressing somewhat slowly, as the great quantity of water met with in the drifts renders the sinking of shafts a matter of some consider able difficulty, so that but little has lately A 2"], [234, "MINING SUBYEYOES* BEPOETS \u2014 MARCH. 56 been done towards defining the direction of the deep ground ; it is clearly ascertained however that the dip of the bed-rock is in a northerly direction, and from that fact, together with the fact that a series of rich claims extending in a northerly direction are being worked, it may be fairly presumed that a lead exists, and it only requires skill and energy to overcome the difficulties met with in sinking to discover its course. The machinery is as follows From the direction in which the deep leads at Ballaarat appear to run, together with the dip of the bed rock in this (Sago Hill) locality, I am led to the belief that a junc tion of the Ballaarat and Sago Hill Leads exists, and since the Government purposes to send out or to assist prospecting parties, I consider that prospecting in the locality or supposed locality of the junction might be pursued with very great advantage, as, if the situation of the deep ground could be clearly ascertained, a vast field would be opened up for our mining population and for mining enterprise. Nine alluvial claims, ten quartz claims, and five water rights have been taken up in this division during the month. During the month of March, the absence of water still retarded mining operations in alluvial workings; but the enforced idleness gave opportunity to the miners to turn their attention to the hitherto almost neglected quartz reefs. The large number of quartz claims already taken up would induce me to characterise this movement as a mania were I not satisfied, from the prospects already obtained, that the result will be different from that which generally attends manias. Though the quartz in this district has not yet been proved as rich as that found in some other districts on the gold fields, still its abundance and the facility with which it can be obtained from its contiguity to the sur face, render the pursuance of quartz mining in this district very remunerative. Such ci mpanies as have been enabled to procure half an ounce or upwards per ton. are com bining their resources to provide their own machinery, and thereby save the profit of the millowners. The mining of the deep leads on Ballaarat during the last month differs but little from the previous month. Upon the Inkermann Lead no change has taken place. Upon the Golden Point Lead the yield has been much less than during previous months, owing principally to the companies having been engaged in necessary but unproductive labor. Upon the Nightingale, Malakhoff, and Milk maid Leads, no change of importance has occurred, except that the British Company, on the Malakhoff Lead, in prospecting the reefs contiguous to its original claim has dis covered several nuggets, some of which are of considerable value. Upon the Redan Lead the yield is improving. The Township Quartz Reef Company is now in full work, and the quartz obtained is yielding a very fair return. [Mr. Davidson has not furnished tables in accordance with the instructions.] On the Black Hill and vicinity there are twenty-two quartz claims and five alluvial claims at present at work. The same energy is still visible, and satisfaction prevails among the miners. In addition to the crush ing engines at present located there, two others capable of working twelve and eight stampers respectively are in course of erec tion. No. 2 Division. (P. C. Fitzpatrick, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows : \u2014 The Black Hill Company, or more pro perly the Ballaarat Quartz Crushing Com pany, are now employed in crushing their own. The introduction of blankets in con nection with their amalgamating troughs, has been the means of saving upwards often per cent, above the former yield.

Previous to the arrival of rain the com pany were compelled to remove their tailings to a distance from the machinery, an incon venience now obviated and an expense saved by the clearance of the creek. The machinery is a3 follows : \u2014 Little Bendigo. \u2014 The chief characteristic of this locality is the rapidly increasing change from alluvial to quartz miuing. At present there are eighteen companies engaged specially in quartz mining, and several of these have obtained good prospects. The Band of Hope Company, on a newly opened reef of that name, are about to erect machinery, and from the prospects obtained very sanguine expectations prevail as to the richness of the reef. The Monte Christo Company have commenced crushing, but I have not heard the result. From my own knowledge of this reef I am certain it will prove as remunerative as any on Ballaarat. There are thirty-three companies holding alluvial claims; but as nearly all these hold their claims under bye-laws X. and XI. (by which claim-owners are entitled to all the gold contained in their claims), I expect in a short time to see them turn their attention to quartz. The late rains have enabled the greater number of them to continue opera tions, and where depression and stagnation prevailed a month since, the greatest activity is now seen. The approximate value of all the mining plant in the division is \u00a369650. During the last fortnight several heavy falls of rain have afforded an abundant supply of water to the miners. Previous to the rain a very large number of puddling machines were compelled entirely to cease work, and thus a considerable num ber of men were thrown out of employment. The effect of this want of employment was abundantly evident in the district, as well as in the diminished escort returns from this Lead Horse Gully and Springs. \u2014 The dry weather has caused the greater part of the diggers to abandon these parts of the district, and even the Chinese have migrated to dis tricts better supplied with water. There is nothing of any consequence to report on, but now tliat the rainy season has set in, I ex pect the return of the majority of the last winter's population. place. It was also shown by the returns forwarded in my last report of the number of claims held in reserve, the greater number of which were unworked on account of the failure in the supply of water. Several of the quartz companies were how ever able to continue work, owing to the arrangements they had made for returning the water to the dam after it had been used, and some had an abundant supply derived from the water found in sinking their shafts. Those employed in surface sinking however suffered very severely, but I am happy to report that they have nearly all resumed operations. I am now engaged in surveying and levelling two sites for dams on the Gong Gong Creek, the leturns of which I will for ward as soon as the necessary work is completed. I may mention, that a great many of the quartz crushing companies will be tolerably well supplied with water during the next summer, as they for the most part have con structed large dams, and made arangements for using their water several times over.

The progress of quartz mining is still sa tisfactory, and the results obtained are such as to encourage the prosecution of work in this branch of mining. During the last month two new companies have got fairly to work, namely, the Enter prise and the Cornish United Companies. The former has crushed 240 tons, from which they obtained a yield of 155 ounces, or nearly 13 dwts. to the ton. The latter com pany has crushed 110 tons, which gave a yield of 60 ounces, or nearly 1 1 dwt. per ton. Tredennick and party have commenced crushing with a new battery of 16 stamps. This party has been at work on the Golden Point lode for more than two years, and the results obtained even with very imperfect ma chinery, were such as to induce them to go to the expense of erecting new and powerful ma chinery. The work performed by this party may be taken to prove the fact, that the quartz lodes on this gold field will prove highly profitable when properly worked. An experiment is now in course of trial by the Llanberris Company on the Gum Tree Flat, to diminish the friction of the guides to the stamp shafts. This is effected by placing a grooved wheel instead of the usual V guide, so that as the shaft ascends or descends the wheel revolves, and this diminishes the friction. Whether this arrangement will prove useful for a long period 1 am unable to say, as very little work as yet been done with it. The quartz in the claim is found in imme diate contact with the alluvial washing stuff, hut the present workings are about 50 feet below. This lode was struck when the alluvial ground was being worked and at that time a large number of specimens were obtained. Sheet No. 3 shows plans and sections of the Enterprise Company's works on the Gum Tree Flat. It will be seen from the plan and sections, that the company have workings at different depths. The upper drive was put in a northerly direction at a depth of 123 feet. After going a short distance in the original direction, they drove 28 feet to the west where they struck two small veins, as shown on section A. At the end of the drive named, they struck a vein, at the point marked C on the plan. This vein or leader was followed in a southerly direction to the distance of 40 feet and was increasing in thickness. Sections D and E show two faces of the drive at different portions of the work. Section D shows the appearance of the face of the drive at a distance of four feet from where the vein has struck, and it will bs observed that there are two separate branches dipping in opposite directions, namely one to the east and one to the west. Section E shows the face of the drive at its present distance from the original point, namely 40 feet. It will be seen that the veins have in creased in thickness, but the same character istics are preserved. It will also be observed by the appearance of the vein that only the uppermost or surface portion was struck, which is proved by the increased quantity of quartz obtained at the points F and N. The upper workings were also continued in a northerly direction, and a vein of quartz was struck at the point marked G, which was of the same character as that found in the southern drive. I beg herewith to forward you a plan and sections of quartz workings in my district. Sheet No. 1 is a section of the surface from the Cornish Mining Company's shaft on the Gum Tree Flat, to Peak and Party's on the Golden Point lode ; showing the Chinese parties and the shafts of Tredennick and party, and the Enterprise Company. In a previous report, detailed plans and sections of Peak and Party's and the Llan berris Company's shafts were given, and they are placed upon the present section to show the connection and relative depths of the various workings as well as the strata passed through. Sheet No 2, shows a section of the Cornish United Company's shaft. It will be observed that this company have a very large quartz lode, the width being nearly 34 feet. This lode is different to those usually found in this district, is dipping to the east ; the general dip on Ballaarat being in a westerly direction. There ate however on the other side of the shaft several veins dip ping in a westerly direction, as shown on the plans. It may be remarked of this company's shaft that it is probably the strongest on Ballaarat, the whole of the slabs being four inches in thickness. The drive was continued to the point marked H, where the clay-slate was broken through and washing stuff obtained, thus showing that the clay-slate or bottom must have dipped 30 feet in a distance of 56 feet. Section I is a longitudinal section of the eastern side of drive H H. Section J is a section of the drive H on the sectional line 1, 2, showing the quartz at the bottom of the drive and the washing stuff on the opposite side. The lower drive was put in a short distance, in a southerly direction, at a depth of 36 feet below the upper drive. It was continued but a short distance in a southerly direction, and then the company drove east and west, as shown on the plan.

In the western drive only a few small veins were struck. In sinking the shaft a body of quartz 8 feet in thickness was passed through at a depth of 11 feet from the upper drive, and at the point marked M a monkey shaft was put up a distance of 20 feet, and the quartz was again struck at the point marked N on the section, thus showing a continua tion of the lode struck in the main shaft. sary alterations in their machinery, made but little progress since my last report. The Polar Star Company, on this lead, have completed the erection of one of the finest engines in the district. It was manufactured at the Victoria Foundry at Ballaarat. As a specimen of workmanship it is certainly not surpassed in the neighborhood. It is of 40 horse-power, with two large boilers. Its working has proved in every way satisfactory, and very favorable results may be, ere long, expected from this company's operations. Section 0 is a section of the drive K look ing north. On the Napoleon Lead, the Sons of Free dom are still combating with the great influx of water. The work is prosecuted with vigor, and although more than 300 gallons of water are lifted per minute, no sensible diminution has taken place. It is hoped however that a steady perseverence in the present system will eventually overcome the difficulty. With the exception of the marking off on old ground, claims, no alteration has taken place on this lead for a considerable period. No. 5, OR Buninyong Division. (James W. R. Pringle, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows : \u2014 The Franklin Company, after nearly three years steady work, have at length broken into deep ground, after having driven 370 feet from the shaft ; and from the information I have been enabled to obtain, they have a fair prospect of ultimate success. * Including 600 unregistered miners. The machinery is as follows The Pactolus Company, formerly the Tele graph Company, on the Union Jack Lead, have driven from the shaft 472 feet in an easterly direction. At a distance of 430 feet a bore was put up in the back of the drive, which broke through at twenty-seven feet, striking black clay. It is contemplated to effect another bore at the present face, under the impression that possibly they may be too deep. The Industry Company, on the Devon shire, being the only company at present on this lead, are still prosecuting their work with I fear but indifferent success. The various quartz reefs in this district are beginning to attract the attention of the miner ; and a better test of their value there fore will, it is hoped, be soon ascertained. Several of the companies, whose claims are shown on the accompanying plan, have already sunk to a considerable depth, and seem resolved to give the reefs a fair trial ; but, owing to the absence of crushing ma chinery, as well as water where machinery has been provided, little or no crushing has as yet taken place. The Pioneer Company, on the Durham Lead, have resumed work at the face, after having been swamped out for some days, in consequence of a breakage in the machinery. From the gradual increase of water, and certain favorable indications in the nature of the reef, it is anticipated that the gutter will be soon reached. The Telegraph Company, on the Durham Lead, are vigorously at work, the share holders securing fair returns. The John Bull Company, on this lead, are now in the gutter and have commenced pudd ling this week, but with what result I am at present unable to state. Anderson and party, on the All Nation's Reef, are however fairly at work, and as they have several hundred tons of quartz on the surface, I hope soon to hear of their having realised good returns.

No. 6, Division. The Flag Staff and Royal Standard Leads are not yet sufficiently developed to allow a final decision being pronounced upon their qualities. I observe that in a great many instance work is either suspended or carried on very indifferently there, owing to the nature of the leads requiring a greater outlay than was first estimated, and than the ma jority of the claim owners can command. Indeed the lack of sufficient capital on all onr deep leads is the most serious drawback to their development. On the shallow gullies and surfacing hills all over the district pre parations are going forward for puddling and sluicing when the rainy season sets in. (John Lynch, Mining Surveyor.)

Mining operations at Clunes for the early portion of last month were much impeded from a want of water, that is as far as the extraction of the gold was concerned; but I find that most of the companies have em ployed themselves at certain \"dead work\" in opening the mines to facilitate future workings. The late rain has supplied the desideratum, and more activity has mani fested itself, but so as nearer to approach the average results.

At 2 feet 6 inches from the battery two amalgamating troughs already described are placed, (assuming that the beds retain the greatest part of the gold); below them have been placed in four compartments of 2 feet 6 inches by 14 inches each, two sil vered copper plates, and two blankets, which have been changed every 24 hours from side to side.

The Haphazard Quartz Company have re commenced work, and struck the reef. The metal promises exceedingly well, but it has not yet been tested. The Clunes Alluvial Company are working the new ground struck about two months since. The wash-dirt yields from 10 to 16 oz. to the machine. During the month they have divided \u00a322 per shareholder. The North Clunes Eureka Company have bottomed at 160 feet, dipping slightly to the east. The sinking has been through 5 feet of sandy surface, 125 feet of rock, and 30 feet of mixed red and white clay. The bottom is pipeclay, into which they sunk 5 feet and have driven 45 feet east, without getting paying ground. (J. B. Cusack, Mining Surveyor.)

Gordon. \u2014 The Mount Hope Company have raised about 800 tons of quartz from the Lone Star and Leviathan Reefs, some of which is burned and ready at the machine for crushing ; but as they have as yet no water for crushing they have reduced the number of men in the works. Eaton and Company have abandoned their sluicing claim. On the Southern Hill the Young Sons of Freedom are still making about \u00a310 per man weekly ; the John Bull Company \u00a34, and the Southern Lights from \u00a34 to \u00a36 each share holder per week. The Lord Nelson Company are through the rock at 138 feet, and are puddling up the shaft. The Lone Star Reef, at 72 feet deep (one of the levels at which they are working) averages 7 feet in thickness. At 130 feet, another level being worked, the reef is 6 feet in thickness. The reef is easily mined, being broken, with seams of pipe clay and grit. The rock is a soft sandstone, varying in color from white to white and dull red streaked and dark brown. To the present depth the reef is quite dry. The gold seen in the quartz at the greatest depth (130) is of a much coarser (i.e., larger particles,) sample than any found at a less depth. On the Leviathan Reef the works are suspended for the present. The thickness of the reef at the depth at which the works were stopped (50 feet) is 7J feet. None of the other reefs (Moore's and Morgan's) within the company's ground have as yet been tried by the company ; nor is it intended until after the quantity of quartz raised from the other reefs has been tested. The late rain has enabled them to get up steam, and the action of the engine is most satisfactory. They did not put the stamping (King's patent) battery in motion, as they had not sufficient water. Around Creswick the continued drought has retarded mining operations, as the greater portion of the diggings in this quarter being old ground, it is impossible to work it suc cessfully. The Bald Hills Lead appears more pro mising. The ground up to the private pro perty is occupied, and all the claims (viz., six), are at work. Arrangements have been made with the proprietors cf the adjacent land for working it. The general yield through the month has been ajiove 10 oz. to the machine. Edwards and Company, on Frenchman's Lead, have commenced crushing quartz, but were obliged to suspend operations for a few weeks, owing to the guide plate for their stampers (one of King and Howland's patent) having given way.

At depths of 112 and 198 feet respectively, and driving north and south, the thickness of the reef is six feet. The quartz crushed in March yielded, from separate crushings, the follow ing :\u2014 From 19 tons, 17 dwt. person ; from 51 tons, 9 dwt. 5 gr. per ton ; and from 5J tons, 13 dwt. 5 gr. per ton. On Fisher's Reef the works are suspended. The last crushing of 28J tons, taken from the north end of the reef at a depth of between 27 and 40 feet, yielded only 2 J oz. per ton. The quartz tailings at the machines are found to contain gold in sufficient quantities to pay for re-working. The Kangaroo Com pany are now occupying their spare time, when they have no quartz ready, in putting through the tailings at their machine which has been accumulating from different reefs since the opening of this gold field. Mount Egerton. \u2014 On the Large Hill there are four claims being worked. No. 1 claim is working an eastern leader, 2 feet thick. From the appearance of the quartz it is ex pected it will yield 1 oz. per ton. No. 2 claim is working a western leader, 2 feet thick, and the quartz looks equally good. No. 3 claim is working in the main reef, which is 32 feet thick. They are only taking a width of 4 feet, as they do not consider that the quartz at a greater width would pay for working. The depth of the shaft is 80 feet. No. 4 claim is down 90 feet in a main shaft, which they intend to sink to 250 feet before trying the reef. All these claims have quartz out, but have not had any crashed since January, in consequence of the scarcity of water at the machines. The late rains however have supplied sufficient for the present. On the Little Hill one claim is being worked. At 100 feet in depth they are work ing a leader, 4 feet 6 inches in thickness. The bed-rock on the hills is soft, coarse, white sandstone. There i>- very little of importance to com municate this month. On Steiglitz but little has been done by the companies, holding the great extent of reefs, to develop them, and judging from present appearances the pro mises for the future are rather of a dis- couraging nature. The Sailors' Reef Company continue their operations on their still small and imperfect scale, with scarcely payable results. The Perseverance Company are exactly in the same position as when I reported some two or three months ago, doing nothing. The Union Company have sunk their trial shaft to 100 feet in depth, and intend driving east to catch the vein. The Cosmopolite Company have obtained a lease of 100 yards on Boxing Reef, and will commence operations next week. The Steiglitz Company have completed all their preliminary operations, as regards erecting machinery and pumping apparatus. No doubt in a few weeks we may expect to hear of good results from the deep ground. The Gibraltar Company, which has hitherto promised so well both as to the quantity and quality of quartz obtainable in their mine, is comparatively at a standstill, owing to the small machinery employed in drawing the water from the claim.

The Albion Company, Portuguese Reef, have completed their winding and pumping shaft to the depth of 180 feet. Fresh tenders are invited for sinking it deeper. A lease has been granted to Me\u00absrs. Pike and French for 400 yards of ground on New Chum Keef. The population has not been so stationary lately, several having left for Inglewood and Kiandra. The Redan Company have applied for a lease of ground ou the New Chum Keef. Since my last report we have been visited by a very heavy shower, and latterly slight but frequent rain. The rainfall has not how ever been sufficient to give the miners a permanent supply of water, although those working in the main creek, and some in the adjacent gullies, have for a short time bene fited by the long wished for rainfall. There is however sufficient water to supply the machines worked by steam power. In alluvial mining I have nothing worthy of note to repoit ; the majority of sluicers not having commenced operations, and no new ground having been opened. I have however every reason to believe that several parties are in possession of good payable ground, and are merely awaiting a liberal supply of water iu order to work their ground to advantage. Simmon's Reef \u2014 The Imperial Company have disposed of a large number of shares ; but I presume will not commence mining operations until the company is either formed as a joint stock company, or this abandoned, the shareholders iesume operations on their own account. There are very few individual claims at work here at present. Iron Bark Reef has been taken up afresh, but with no results at present therefrom. The Birmingham Reef, Prospect Claim, have crushed their quartz again, which yielded 7 oz. per ton. A large claim has been taken up on Yankee Smith's Reef, but no results at present. The Scotchman's Reef, Prospect Claim, still continue their operations. A new reef, called Schicer's Reef, has been opened, noith of Yankee Smith's Reef. The specimens I have seen are very good. The reef is about eighteen inches wide. The New Year's Reef, Prospect Claim, have not had any crushing lately, owing to the scarcity of water at the crushing machine near them. Large masses of tailings are being col lected and piled from the different crushing machines. There is no doubt but that with proper appliances they will yield at least 1 oz. per ton. The Crown Company's claim (the best at present in the division) presents the ap pearance of yielding even more satisfactory results than hitherto ; a late crushing of nearly 200 tons having yielded more than one ounce per ton. The company have erected new machinery, and expect to commence crushing in a few days. The Cornish Company are at present en gaged in sinking an air shaft, and have also every reason to believe that this season's yield will be remunerative. The Simmon's Reef Quartz Mining Company have not com menced crushing. The Victoria Company's works are at a standstill, as also the Ler derderg Company ; but I am informed the requisite works on the reef for the latter company will be commenced by the con tractor on the 16th inst. The Morrison's River diggings still con tinue very quiet. Dolly's Creek is presenting a far livelier appearance than it did a month since.

The fall of rain which took place during the last four days of the preceding month although continued for two or three days in this month gave but a very temporary supply ; owing in the first place to the extreme parched state of the ground absorbing a great portion of the fall of rain, and secondly the want of reservoirs for storing the surplus water. The consequence of this is, that mining operations have received but very little impulse during the month. In both divisions raceholders have been busy clearing out the races, (which have been lying idle during the summer season) in an ticipation of the wet weather setting in. For creek claimholders this dry weather has been very beneficial, enabling them to get their tail races and floodraces in proper working order for the winter. On the Lower Nine mile, four parties have been thus busily en gaged, and I am informed their returns are highly remunerative, although the ground on the old system has been wrought two or three times over. Yankee Reef. \u2014 The Ph\u0153nix and El Dorado Companies are carrying levels from the eastern branch of Yankee Gully, to cross cut the reef. The Falkirk and Norwood Company have removed their machinery to work a portion of St. George's Reef, and also intend prospecting for the continuation of Trewhella's Reef in Split-Tree Gully. Johnson's Reef. \u2014 The Golden Point Com pany are now working eight stampers, and have crushed during the last week 94J tons of quartz. The yield has latterly been very low, and not remunerative ; but 1 am enabled to report that a good dividend for the last week has been declared. The Early Bird Company's quartz has not yielded so satisfactorily as expected, and the machine not being iu good working order, has greatly retarded the crushing; and until a thorough overhaul of the machinery, en gine, &c, is made, I do not anticipate that the shareholders will receive a dividend. To show the great want of water in the Yackandandah division, I may mention that up to the present time 150 sluicing claims have been registered dry, or in other words the owners have obtained permission to hold their claims until they can get a sufficiency of water to work them. Now as each of these claims represent an area of 60 yards wide by 160 yards long, there are close upon 300 acres of auriferous soil lying unproductive, through want of water ; as also the number of men who would be required by these claimholders being kept idle, for neither the Yacandandah or Nine-mile are diggings for dry sinkers ; without water and plenty of it nothing can be done. The only part of the population who may be termed dry sinkers are the Chinese ; but such a very slight amount of gold remunerates them, that they must be put down as an exception. No water is running as yet in the Pioneer Company's race, but they expect to have it in very shortly. A great number who had left there for the Kiandra gold field have returned, intending to remain, at any rate during the winter months. BEECHWORTH MINING DISTRICT.

Another engine also has arrived upon a claim just above it that will commence work about the same time. The Caledonian, Durham, and Devonshire Leads call for no report this month, beyond the fact that the several junctions are not yet defined, although many claims upon these leads have been paying well. The Kincardineshire Lead has proved on the whole payable, though from the patchy nature of the wash-dirt the gold is unequally distributed, and claims adjoining each other produce very different results to the claim holders. 1 have no doubt now of its being a continuation of the Durham Lead. The state of the Chiltern, Suffolk, Glasgow, and Italian Leads presents nothing to add to my last report. Sebastopol Lead is now being actively worked, and payable gold has been reported to me as having been found in three claims, the average being lj oz. to the load, from dirt one foot in thickness. With regard to quartz leaders, nothing new has occurred since my last report. The machinery on the Magenta Reef is completed, and will be set to work in the course of the ensuing week. During the last six weeks great numbers of our miners went up to the Snowy River diggings, but in consequence of the severity of the climate preventing work, the majority visited this rush report favorably of the locality for the spring, and avow their inten- tion of revisiting it on the break up of the w in ter. We had three days of continuous rain during the last month which filled the dams and enabled the miners to wash up a large quantity of dirt, the result of which will be observed by a reference to the escort returns. There are several parties out prospecting, and, as far as I can judge of the gullies, with every prospect of success. SANDHURST MINING DISTRICT, Eaqlehawk Division. (G. W. Hart, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Quartz miners, &c 342 Alluvial miners, &c 3,824 4,166 The machinery is as follows A great alteration for the better has taken place within the last fortnight, in consequence of the rain. About two-thirds of the puddling mills are again at work, and something like the old activity is manifest in the principal gullies ; but in the small outlying gullies the same dullness is still apparent, as most of those mills are yet idle. I attribute this to the long dry season having exhausted the means of the owners of the mills, who have left their homes and gone, at least for the present, elsewhere in search of work. Very little is being done by the tub and cradle men, and it appears to me that our gullies are for ever deserted by them. Ofthe few that were working in places where a little water could be found in the summer, the greater part have also left, and gone to find other ground. The Huntly Gold Field is the only one that appears in a vigorous condition; the lead there is still going north, and no doubt will be carried far in that direction. The turn it took lately, rather to the we6t, does not appear to be permanent. The sinking varies between 90 and 110 feet.

I regret much to have to state that the alluvial workings at the Elysian Flat hold out very poor prospects at present. Most of the inhabitants have left the place, and it is almost deserted. Perhaps, now that the autumnal rains have commenced, better suc cess may attend those still working there. Water has been very scarce in that district, as the country is flat. The greater part of the quartz claims are also left unworked. 1 have the honor to submit to the Board of Science two plans of parts of my division, showing the blocks leased, mills,..&c. These require no comment, except that those blocks on which the number is in red were not surveyed by me ; and, also, that there is a block surveyed, lying between No. 211 and 143, being No. 50, which I could not insert, as there is no duplicate of the survey in the Warden's office. sequence of the discovery of a new lead, which proved highly remunerative to the discoverers. The Prospecting Association has not as yet met with signal success, although in some places it struck on a seam of wash-dirt of an auriferous character ; but owing to its thin ness it would be insufficient to render the working of it payable. Quartz reefing is making comparatively rapid progress, and measures are being taken for opening fresh reefs. Some tail crushings have been made, which proved advantageous, and would seem to indicate an ultimately lucrative prospect to the proprietors. The Caledonian Reef continues to yield a steady average of nearly 6 oz. of gold to the ton. There are a good many prospecting claims taken up in the ranges lying between the Corinella and Mo Ivor Creeks, where a great number of quartz leaders crop out to the surface, which have proved auriferous. Most of the stone sent in from thence for crushing yielded from 4 to 5 oz. to the ton. Heathcote Division. (John Breen, Mining Surveyor.

Gibraltar Hill, adjoining McCallum's Creek near its junction with the Back Creek, is again promising well. Two years ago this gold field was second to none in the di vision ; the gold is coarse and nuggetty. Since then the lead has been lost, but again discovered.

The total population of the district is as follows : \u2014 Europeans 13,910 Chinese 850 14,760 St. Arnaud's and Peter's Diggings \u2014 The latter place now is entirely abandoned, and the former, during the late dry season, has suffered much in consequence. For some time previous to the late rains, one of the two quartz crushing machines was idle for the want of water. Another quartz machine is in course of erection, and as several new pay able veins have recently been opened, aud there being a probability of remunerative leased lands shortly being worked, I appre hend there will be sufficient employment, day and night, for all the machinery for some time to come, provided a supply of water is available. A new vein, 20 feet to the west of the Old Gap workings, has lately been opened \u2014 four claims working the prospecting\u2014 quartz paying 1 oz. per ton, and two feet thick. On Stewart's Rets a new vein, east 15 feet of the old workings, has been opened up by Messrs. Raven and party, yielding from 3 to 7 oz. per ton, with 2 feet thickness of stone. A vein called Oakley's has also been dis covered very near to and almost in a line with the latter \u2014 four claims working \u2014 yield ing 1 oz per ton. Innumerable out croppings in a line with those veins may be seen for some distance, but from the irregular position of those that have lately been opened, and the character of the older workings, my opinion is that not upon any portion of the St. Arnaud quartz workings has the main reef yet been reached, but as the surface leaders, in many cases, are in close proximity, at a lower level they will undoubtedly con verge into one main reef. I have the honor to report that the general state of my division, since the late rains, has assumed a more lively appearance, consequent upon a water supply being available for quartz crushing and puddling purposes Those operations for the last two months have been entirely suspended in the division, with the exception of three quartz crushing machines, in consequence of the continuous dry weather, and one of these three has been paying \u00a38 per week for a supply of water from a wet claim upon the Avoca Lead, which shows the value of water upon the dry dig gings, and that a copious supply upon a more extensive scale, whether by a Government scheme or private enterprise, could not fail to be highly remunerative. Lamplough, during the last few weeks, presents more the appearance of one of the settled gold fields. The late departures to the Inglewood rush have materially improved its condition by withdrawing a portion of its surplus population, such as unsuccessful miners, storekeepers, &c. It may safely be presumed that those now remaining are all making at least a good livelihood. The Deep or Main Lead is steadily progressing and trending in the direction of Avoca. The workings on it are now about two miles in length, and three claims wide, and yielding, from what I can ascertain, on the average an ounce to the load, with one foot thickness of wash-dirt, the depth of sinking being 70 feet.

Quartz mining is steadily progressing in the Sandy Creek portion of the division, but at Dunolly, Moliagul, and Cay's very little has been done during the month, with the exception of the Queen's Company, Moliagul, who have been crushing some stone yielding about 7 oz. per ton. The Poverty Reef Com pany's shaft is down 220 feet, and their engine will commence work in a few days. The Stony Reef Company have commenced to erect their machinery and have a considerable quantity of stone ready for crushing. The Greeks Hill, and Wilson Reef Companies have about 300 tons ready for crushing ; they have as yet no machinery on the ground but are employing a number of men, and have great expectations. The price for crushing quartz at Sandy Creek is 15s. per ton for stampers, and 35s. per ton for the Chilian mills. One machine combines the two processes at the same charge. (B. J. McMillan, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows : \u2014 The machinery is as follows Korong Division. (John Catto, Miuing Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Europeans 24,000 Chinese 360 Inconsequence of a fall of rain in this di vision, about the middle of March, a con siderable impetus was given to mining in ge neral. Nearly all the crushing machines and a good number of puddling machines were able to commence operations, and the conse quence is that the population has increased by a few returning from Inglewood, and by the addition of some Chinese. 24,360 The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Alluvial mining is almost entirely con- fined to old ground, nothing new having been discovered during the month, with the ex- ception of a patch of nuggetty ground on the western slope of Poverty Hill, Sandy Creek, and a short distance outside of the boundary of Poverty Reef Company's lease, and adjoining the old lead, near the main street. A 19 oz., a 6 oz., and a number of smaller nuggets have been got in ground varying from a few inches to 4 feet in depth, showing how valuable the surface of the slopes are likely to be to the companies who have secured leases of reefs in this locality. There can be little doubt of the surface of a large portion of the quartz reef lease blocks here paying handsomely. No alluvial company in this division has as yet begun to make preparations fo%working, although several leases of large area in good localities have been gazetted a long time, and of course their ground is not available to the public either for individual mining or for the purpose of other companies. During the past month mining operations have been extremely dull, except on the Inglewood gold field, which still remains the centre of attraction. The dullness on the older fields is owing to the long continued dry season, and the absence of all miners having funds sufficient to try the new field. At Korong the new crushing machinery lately erected has com menced operations, and may now be expected to give an impetus to quartz mining, or en couragement to those willing to prospect, and work the many quartz veins in the neighborhood. Although several rich veins have been found on the surface they have not been followed to any great depth. At Jericho a few claims are being profit ably worked on the German Reef, but the great scarcity of water has retarded the crushing of quartz during the last three months. Such scarcity has now been re moved by the late rains, and crushing hag again been commenced. li Alluvial miners Quartz miners Europeans. 2,040 850 2,890 Chinese. 400 400 No. Horse-power.

At Kingower quartz mining is being con tinued on the Union and Bonaccord Reefs. After about seven months prospecting the latter reef is expected to remunerate the. prospectors and others engaged thereon. In alluvial mining nothing worthy of note has occurred lately. A few nuggets are con tinually being discovered adjoining the old ground. This neighborhood, like Korong, I expect will be thoroughly prospected to good advantage during the ensuing winter, now that a large population of miners is in the district. Fenton's and Synnott's Diggings are al most deserted, except by a few European and Chinese. CASTLEMAINE MINING DISTRICT. Hepburn Division. (Ambrose Johnson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Mclntyre's Diggings only contain a few, who are engaged in the old workings. Mar shall's Reef has been worked during the past fifteen months without any fresh discovery, or payable gold obtained. At Inglewood more alluvial ground is con tinually being discovered as auriferous, now that this locality has been savored by a sup ply of rain. I again report that throughout the whole scrub payable gold will be found, also in most of the flats and gullies adjoining it on all sides. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The late rains caused great damage to the deep ground (being worked) at New Ingle wood. Several claims will require timber ing to the height of 10 or 12 feet. No new discovery has been made in quartz reefs during the month. Those reefs already dis covered are progressing favorably ; but seve ral having worked out the surface veins will be likely required to expend considerable labor previous to the discovery of any main reef. The general state of mining, although somewhat retarded by the early setting in of winter, is slowly but steadily progressing. Quartz mining.\u2014 I have to report the dis discovery of two new reefs during the month. Emerald Reef, near Lanky Gully, where in the prospecting claim, gold was struck on the surface. A couple of crushings from this claim, both very payable, have been made, aud several shafts in the adjoining claims are going down. Pioneer Keef, Forty Foot, Yandoit, will if report speaks truly, excel anything as yet seen on Jim Crow. 1 have been shown splendid specimens from the prospecting claim, and shall in my next re port be able to give accurate information of the yield, no quartz yet having been crushed. thirteen or fourteen claims are being sunk on the line of reef, but I have not heard of any show like that of the prospectors has been obtained. The deepest shaft yet on Inglewood is 166 feet (perfectly dry), the owners of which obtained payable stone during the first 12 feet, since which they have been following the supposed veins to the present depth occasionally finding auriferous quartz, al though not in quantities sufficient to pay. Puddling mills have hitherto been prevented on this field, owing to the large extent of ground suitable for individual miners, (yet untried), adjoining the worked portion. Per mission to erect such machines at the Sandy Creek has been freety given, and several are being erected. The distance from the ground yet opened is about two miles ; yet from first choice of ground, I believe they will repay the owners. These machines will be chiefly supplied with water from a steam engine situated on the Loddon for the purpose. The necessary race has been cut for conveying the water (about two miles). The absence of puddling mills on the ground (being worked) is greatly against the wishes of those parties willing to erect them ; yet I believe their absence for the ensuing winter at least A number of old discovered reefs are being worked by one or two parties each, who on an average may be said to earn fair wages, and I havo herewith given a table, showing the average produce of the last crushings, where 'uartz miners .lluvial miners Europeans. 175 1,747 Chinese. 903 1,922 903 At work.

Alluvial sinking. \u2014 With the exception of Whitehead's Lead, Kidd's Gully, alluvial sinking has been rather dull during the month of March, and, now the water is plen tiful, the greater majority of miners will probably betake themselves to sluicing, where even if the ground is poor something is made every day, while in siuking in old ground the chance to make more than a living is very limited. I have been able to obtain such information. In the late rush in Kidd's Gully the miners on the whole have been doing remarkably well, but a number of claims will soon be worked out, and the large heaps of dirt stacked be washed up. Several shafts are going down 80 or 90 feet in rock, having very heavy drift water to contend with, but I have not heard of any having bottomed. In the old gullies about Boot's, and in Yandoit, no rushes have taken place, and no instances of extraordinary good luck have come to my knowledge. The mining population has been rather un settled during the month, a number being away at Inglewood and other diggings, hut the majority will probably be back to work their sluicing or puddling claims registered during the summer for want of water._ I have had some difficulty in distinguishing their occupation, as a number were not actually puddling or sluicing, but removing, prospecting, or making other preparations for the winter. You will thus perceive that a comparatively large number of reefs are being worked,.and I have very little doubt that if they were properly prospected a larger number of claims would be found payable. The Specimen Hill Quartz Mining Com pany isjjn a fair advanced state, and the Welcome Quartz Mining Company are busy prospecting their ground, but none of these, nor the Adam's Keef Company, have as yet obtained grants. St. Andrew's Division. (James Murphy, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows : \u2014 Puddling and Sluicing. \u2014 Of these two branches of mining I can only say very little. Winter seems during the last month to have set in in good earnest, and this being a month or two earlier than usual, a number of parties were quite unprepared, having their sluicing and puddling claims registered and working elsewhere, and as in most instances two or three weeks' preparatory labor will be necessary, no very great amount of gold has been produced. It is expected that this early commencement of winter will give sluicers and puddlers constant employment for seven or eight months, a circumstance that will materially tend to make compara tively poor ground payable. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Only a limited number of claims have been granted lately, but the present copious supply of water will probably cause a stir. In tunnelling no perceptible change has occurred, all the principal basaltic hills being in full work, and on art average paying very well, but no new tunnelling ground has been opened, and from (jlengower no news has come to my knowledge. b2 w <y K 1 be m C s'i _ m. 63 5a Pa Nuggetty Reef 2merald Keef tfelvin's Eeef Frenchman's Reef Keef . . . . . . iVombat Eeef Collier's Reef irey's Reef barker's Specimen Reef Sportsman's Reef Jailor's Reef (abandoned) *erseverance Reef (no crushing lately) Doctor's Reef Moneer Reef loggett's Reef )ld German Keef tfew German Reef )ld Nuggetty Reef riemeut's Reef Christmas Reef Chance Reef (no late information) 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 3 oz. 1\u00a3 oz. l|oz. l\u00a3oz. 19 dwt. 1 oz. 2 2 4 1 3 1 1 oz.

At Anderson's Creek, the Yarra Yarra Mining Company have completed their dams and commenced washing. The average yield is, I am informed, 1 Ib. weight of gold per day, from what I consider the poorest part of their leasehold. The number of men em ployed is about thirty-five. The approximate value of all the mining plant within the division is \u00a37.925. Note.\u2014 The increase in the value of machinery and mining plant is owing to the completion of the machinery and fittings of the Yarra Yarra Sluicing Company, the Yarra Yarra Steam Puddling Company, some additions to Williamson's machinery and plant, and to a slight in crease in the number of diggers. As regards the state of mining affairs in the St. Andrew's Mining Division during the month of March, I beg to state, that in quartz mining the results are generally more satisfactory than they have been for some time past, wherever an ordinary amount of perse verance is applied. On the Swedish Keef, at One Tree Hill, another patch has been struck, 57 Ibs. weight of quartz from which has yielded 17 Ibs. weight of gold; and one small piece of quartz from the same claim, and not exceeding in its greatest dimension 3J inches, has yielded 3 Ibs. weight of gold. This of course was picked quartz ; but it was all taken from about 5 feet in extent of the vein. The number of tub and cradle washers on the Anderson's Creek gold field does not ex ceed six, sufficient and more remunerative em ployment being afforded the miners of that locality by Wilkinson and Company at quartz mining, and by the Yarra Yarra Mining Com pany and the Yarra Yarra Steam Puddling Company at alluvial mining. The new machinery of the last mentioned company is all but completed, with many improvements, and will commence working permanently in a few days. Gold has been discovered in the countiy lying between the Back Creek and the Dia mond Creek, but the exact locality, where the discoverers are at work is not known yet; it is certain however that samples of gold have been brought in from that part of the country, and sold at one of the stores on the Caledonia. This is the country to which I drew the attention of prospectors some months ago, in one of my reports. The Nicholson gold field is all but deserted, there being only twelve miners at work there now. On Hoddle's Creek, where gold was discovered last January, about sixty miners are at work, and supposed to be doing well. 1 am informed that about thirty men have left the Britannia gold field to prospect the country at the source of the Yarra. The inferior quartz averages about 4 oz. to the ton at a depth of 65 feet. The adjoining claims, north and south, give an average yield of about the same, with an average thickness of quartz of 1 foot. Gold has also been struck at a depth of 65 feet on this reef, where it runs into the mining leasehold of Messrs. Holmes, Randle, and Ricards, but the exact yield is not known as yet. A company has been formed for the pur pose of working in a more efficient manner the Prospect Claim, and claims No. 2, 3, and 4 on Swedish Reef, and also some of the claims on Moonlight Reef, and they will no doubt commence operations as soon as all their arrangements are complete. I believe that it is only by means of such companies that the quartz mines of this divi sion will be worked in such a manner as to be of any permanent benefit to the miners them selves aud to the division generally ; as, along with unskilful mining, by which valuable ground is left in such a state as to be dan gerous to those who mine in such a manner, and useless to succeeding occupants until a heavy expense is incurred ; the practice is to work the ground as long as it yields payable gold with the least amount of labor, and aban don it as soon as two or three tons of quartz fail to answer the expectations of those con cerned ; of course there are exceptions to this rule, and want of capital has a good deal to do with the matter in some cases. The forma tion of companies would remedy all this. ARARAT MINING DISTRICT. Ararat, Pleasant Creek, and Raolan Divisions, (John G. Wilson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 In alluvial mining on the Caledonia gold field, where the principal mode of washing is with the tub and cradle, the yield of gold is generally unremunerative.

In the alluvial sinking there has been a pretty extensive rush to Sebastopol and Forty Foot, and some very fair prospects have been obtained. On Glen Dhu Reef things have been very dull for some time, principally from a great part of the reefers having registered their claims for a time and departed for Lamplough and Inglewood, and also from the inferior quality of the gold, as what has been already obtained has hardly paid the expenses of raising and crushing. The quality of the gold has run from 16 to 19 carats fine, and the price from \u00a31 16s. to \u00a32 8s. The alloy consists of silver and iridium, the latter pre dominating. I have no doubt but that the gold will improve as the reef is worked deeper. A prospecting association has been started by a few spirited individuals at Ararat for the purpose of trying the ground within seven miles of the township. The party, it is expected, will be at work on Monday, the 16th instant. Campbell's. \u2014 On Campbell's Reef six of the claims north of the prospectors have amalgamated for the purpose of erecting ma chinery to develope the reef. It is proposed to erect a 30 horse-power engine for the pur pose of pumping water and crushing quartz. A company has been formed under Ireland's Act, and on the Cornish principle. It is the first company which has been formed in the district, and I have no doubt, if properly managed, will yield handsomely. Mitchell's (alluvial). \u2014 About two months ago a party started to prospect the alluvial ground in the vicinity of Mitchell's Reef. The sinking is about 40 feet, through cement nearly all the way down. They commenced washing up two days ago, and the average yield has been half-an-ounce to the load ; and they expect that it will turn out better. No main reef has as yet been discovered, but some splendid stone has been obtained from several spurs dipping westward at an angle of 45\u00b0. At Messrs. Dermer and Craw ford's machine an accident happened which might have been attended by fatal conse quences. An incrustation of salt had been deposited in the bottom of the boiler to a depth of 5 inches in some places, and in con sequence there was a most serious explosion, the boiler being thrown upwards of 20 feet from its bed, luckily without injuring any one. I have obtained a specimen of the crust, and a bottle of the water from the shalt Mullock Bank. \u2014 A rush took place to the Mullock Bank a short time since, about two miles west of the township on the Pleasant Creek Road. There are about sixty men at work, and all are making good wages. In the Prospectors' claim they bottomed about 100 feet down, through pipeclay and cement. The washdirt is a greasy green colored quartzose clay, and has turned out nuggets of 1 oz. to 1J oz in weight. In the other claims they have struck a false bottom at a depth of about 60 feet, and most of them are paying. which supplied the boiler, and these I shall forward for analysis when I can find a safe opportunity. There are two engines being erected on this reef, in addition to those already at work \u2014one by Matthews and Co. to work their claim, and another \u2014 one of Clayton and Shuttleworth's, \u2014 by a company which has been formed to work the alluvial ground north of the amalgamated claims.

On and about the Black Hill the greatest industry prevails. Every available piece of ground is being taken up for quartz mining. In this part of the district alone there are 288 men engaged in quattz. mining opera tions. The Black Hill Company is still pro gressing satisfactorily both as regards the amount of labor and the returns of gold ; and although the average per ton does not exceed halfan ounce, still, from the facility with which it is worked and the large quan tity of quartz obtained, this yield is sufficient to render the outlay incurred a good specula tion.

The mining population is as follows : \u2014 The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Independent Company have just com pleted the erection of their crushing ma chinery, and will commence operations to morrow. The plant, consisting of a 16 horse power engine, with twelve stampers, tram ways, &c, is valued by competent judges at about \u00a35000. It is owned by ten working shareholders, and although they hold only 115 feet along the reef, I have no doubt but that it will prove to them a very valuable investment.

I regret to say arc proceeding but slowly ; so much so indeed that the miners in the neighborhood are predicting that before the expiration of six months the ground will be in their own possession. The Victoria Reef passes through the greater part of this claim, and yet no steps have been taken to search for it. It would be well if the company employed more men than they do at present. The Crocodile Company, composed of eight working shareholders, are in an advanced state of forwardness with their new crushing machinery ; consisting of an engine of 12 horse-power and eight stamps. Adjoining the engine there is a dam of considerable dimensions for storing water. On Dead Horse Reef, with the exception of the Caledonian Company, there are but few miners at present engaged. Report gives it, that the last named company are remu neratively employed on their claim. They have a 10 horse-power engine driving two pud dling machines. The machines are elevated about 10 feet from the surface, and sluices are attached to them, which convey the sludge a considerable distance from the works. Having a laige area of ground, and at pre sent a good supply of water, the company are sanguine as to the result of the winter's work now before them. The quartz reefs dis covered in the Little Bendigo district have been followed up to this neighborhood, and claims lately abandoned have been again taken up. The Mopoke United Company, occupying a large area of ground, are taking advantage of the local regulations which enable them to carry on operations by contract for the purpose of testing the ground before they venture on any large outlay for plant. The Emu Company, comprising the amal gamated companies of Atkinson and Co. and Chutam and Co., have struck a paying reef close to the surface ; but as they feel satis fied from the appearance of the reef that a better yield will be found at a greater depth they are still sinking. Claims have been taken np further north of these already mentioned to the distance of half a mile, and for a width of 2000 feet, but as these claims have been only recently entered upon I am unable to report definitely of their prospects. The Springs. \u2014 There is little or nothing being done at present in this locality. The greater part of the mining population has abandoned it, and those only who are unable to leave remain to eke out a bare subsistence. The more plentiful supply of water, now that the winter has set in, will most probably in duce a return of the greater part of its former inhabitants. In the direction of Little Bendigo several new reefs have been opened up since my last report. Most of these are highly estimated, being considered not inferior to any in the district, so far as they have yet been tested. Among others, the Victoria Reef, which is occupied to the eastward to the extent of 27 miles, has furnished some remarkably rich specimens of auriferous quartz. Some quartz has been lately crushed from the claim of Hoskins and party, on the Band of Hope Reef, at the Monte Christo Company's works, and from 24 tons of stone the yield was 20 oz. 7 dwt. The depth at which this quartz was obtained does not exceed 40 feet from the surface. The prospecting party known as the Band of Hope Company have entered into arrangements for obtaining machinery for crushing, some of which is on the ground. From these and other successes the people of this part of the district are all turning their attention to quartz mining, and claims which three months since were considered valueless are now held in high estimation. The Monte Christo Company have adopted the principle, lately so successfully tested at the Clunes workings, of substituting quicksilver plates for the blankets hitherto used.

The approximate value of all the mining plant within the division is \u00a339,400. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 I have the honor to forward with this report a plan of some auriferous gullies in the neighborhood of Mount Misery and the Staffordshire Quartz Reef, that are likely to be soon repossessed by most of their old occu pants, who during the summer months re turned to Inglewood and other such places, in hopes of making a speedy \"pile,\" but to their great disappointment and disgust they are just commencing to return once more to the good old gullies where, as the phrase goes, \" tucker\" could be always made, and where it appears they intend spending their winter quarters. There has been a remarkably rich piece of ground lately discovered in Deep Gully, a little above the Homeward Bound Quartz Crushing Company's dam, and if suitable machinery could be procured (as in time no doubt it will), I am satisfied the greater part of Long Gully, from the dam above mentioned down to the junction with Mount Misery Creek, would well pay for working ; but un fortunately there is too much bottom water to admit of windlass operations being suc cessful, and it appears the time is not yet come in this remote locality for the intro duction of steam or horse power in connection with alluvial mining. Another little gully (Campbell's) on the west of the Staffordshire Reef was a few months since the scene of a rush, and of some short lived excitement. There were some pretty good shallow claims found, but these were soon finished and the ground abandoned. Not so, however, with the large flat gully to the northward of Campbell's at the other side of the saddle of the hill, known as a branch of Old Ita lian: this gully was worked some two or three years ago, and was found to pay to a width of some 70 or 80 feet, and from time to time it has since been successively occupied and abandoned by several parties ; even now there are some five or six parties in occupation of old ground \u2014 puddling machine claims \u2014 here and there along the gully with very fair prospects of steady good wages for the winter.

Though now most of the country referred to is almost in the exclusive occupation of the kangaroo, opossum, and such like animals, already two quartz mining com panies have been getting up crushing ma chinery within the district indicated ; the one at Mount Misery, known as the Midland Counties Quartz Mining and Crushing Com pany, and the other at Pinchgut, about four or five miles to the southward, known as the Germanic Confederation Quartz Mining and Crushing Company. Both companies have, or are on the eve of having completed the erection of their crushing apparatus, so that in my next report I trust to be able to give some satisfactory accounts of the first crush ings. Moreover, there have been two other large quartz claims taken up some two months since in the neighborhood of Pinch gut, the one about a mile and a-half still further to the southward, at a place called Long Gully, the other at a gully called Frenchman's, in the Rokewood direction. Both companies have commenced operations with sanguine hopes of success, which, if realized, will be the means of attracting some of the surplus population of Ballaarat proper out to this, as yet, I may say, terra incognita. Whim Holes. \u2014 I am sorry to say the Pro gressive Company here have been peculiarly unfortunate with their shaft sinking these four or five months past, owing to the loose and half rotten nature of the ground and the softness of the bottom rock or reef \u2014 they find it very difficult to manage the water. They have opened out their drive or level two or three weeks since, at a depth of 105 feet, and though in all likelihood within 30 or 40 feet of the gutter, they have not, up to this, been able to get in quarter that distance ; which is the more perplexing, because the company have every reason to believe the gutter will he, if not rich, at least such as to afford very decent wages if once only reached. The other companies farther in advance are still holding on, waiting to know the result of the Progressive Company's prospects before commencing operations. Higher up the gul ly , the Hand in Hand Company have been getting on pretty well of late. I believe last week's dividend was \u00a35 per man, so that when properly into the gutter and in full work, there is reason to expect much larger dividends. Still higher up the gully, at the northern base of the Little Hard Hills, the lead is being traced into shallow ground, through a tributary gully known as High landman's. Some 40 or 50 unregistered claims, I believe, have been taken up on this gully, and the majority of them found payable, with a few golden holes among them. Nothing noteworthy to be reported of Frenchman's, White Horse, Cobbler, or Black Lead, none of the companies on these leads having yet fully got into the gutter, except the Scottish and Cornish Company, on the last named, and they have been so troubled with bottom water that between breakages of ma chinery, swamping out, and water bailing, they have not been doing much of late, though the gutter has been proved more than ordinarily rich in their claim. The general opinion is, that they will require a set of pumps fully 15 inches in bore or diameter and a 50 horse-power engine, in order to be able to work the claim to advantage. Their present pumps, (12-inch bore) and 25 horse power engine, were considered quite large enough in the beginning, but by dearly bought experience they have been found too small, owing to the immense quantity of water contained in the gutter. Staffordshire Reef. \u2014 Matters on this reef have been unusually quiet and dull during the last two or three months, in consequence of the want of capital with some companies to enable them to prosecute operations, and want of unity or co-operation with others, which has led to the dissolution of one of the most important companies on the reef, namely, the Homeward Bound Quartz Mining and Crushing Company. The claim was sold a few days since, and purchased by Mr. John Evans, a member of the original company, who is about taking up a lease of the ground and making up a new company with sufficient capital to work the claim on the most approved system and principles. It is probable he will have resumed work ere the date of my next report ; if so, I expect to be able to give the result of crushiugs at five mills ; namely, Pinchgut and Mount Misery Mills, already mentioned, and the mills of the Comet Com pany, Evans's, and Messrs.

On the Durham Lead the Pioneer Company is still driving on the reef without any imme diate prospect of breaking into the gutter. The Telegraph Company is working ener getically with fair results. The John Bull Company is also busy at work, and realizing a fair yield. The Polar Star Company, which is the next company on the Durham Lead, has broken through the rock at a depth of 142 feet, and after sinking beneath it about 7 feet, has struck drift and black clay containing fine particles of gold. The Franklyn Company has reached the gutter, but in consequence of some necessary alterations in the machinery, has not worked at the face for some time. The recent rush which has taken place on the reefs may be attributed to the very encouraging results obtained from some of the claims. The Perseverance Company, on the Whitehorse Reef, has intersected a reef at a level of 150 feet in depth, which has yielded some very rich specimens, some of which were shown on the claim some few days since. This reef is 25 feet wide. On the Napoleon Lead nothing worthy of notice has taken place since my last report. The shallow diggings in this district are being worked with a little more spirit since the late rains, and sanguine hopes are enter tained regarding them. The All Nations Company on the same reef has commenced crushing, and although the debris from the reef had been previously washed, and good returns obtained from it, from the crushing of quartz which has been stocked for upwards of two years the results are the most flattering, having up to the present time averaged about fifteen penny weights per ton.

The mining population is as follows : \u2014 The Union Company on the same reef is still sinking, and has intersected several gold-bearing veins, but not yet crushed any quartz. This company struck water at a depth of 110 feet. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 On the Long Gully Reef the Brunswick Company is still sinking two shafts, in which water has been struck, but since my last report no quartz has been crushed. A new reef, the Oriental, which is known to cross the junction of the Frenchman's and Magpie Leads, has been laid off at a distance of 4100 feet. This reef is to be worked by contract, and the company named after the reef. The Oriental will start to work in the ensuing week, the contracts having been accepted. I have also laid off 1 150 feet on the Golden Age Reef, which has been newly opened. The Great Eastern Company has commenced operations thereon, and has this day applied for an extension. The approximate value of all the mining plant within the division is \u00a385,700. Since my last report of the Clunes portion of my district, some encouragement has pre sented itself for energy in prospecting for the continuations of our known quartz lodes, \u2014 the Victoria Company having proved, after nearly two years' work, to have a paying claim. In addition to these reefs I have laid off two prospecting areas for reefs, one near the Hard Hills, and the other at the head of Scotchman's Lead.

From the south shaft a cross drive is put east 114 feet and west 150 feet, in both of which drives they have cut two other veins. The eastern one is 3 feet wide, and is supposed to be the lode bearing that name. The stone looks well. The lode to the west is only 2 feet wide, and also promises to be auriferous. The quartz lodes on this hill at the present depth are much scattered. Many small leaders have been struck in the cross cut, all gold bearing. A test will be shortly made from the two veins mentioned. In alluvial mining but little advance has been made to open new ground ; one com pany, the North Clunes Eureka, having abandoned their works as unprofitable, after expending from the commencement over \u00a31200, on their shaft and drives. The Port Phillip Company have attached the whole of their batteries to their new engine, and during the ensuing month ex pect to reduce a greater quantity of stone The yield from 30th March to the 3id May, from 2335 tons, was 1784 oz. 10 dwt. ; aver age for the five weeks, nearly 15 dwt. 7 gr. per ton. Clunes Company (Quartz) \u2014 In my last I mentioned that this company had struck a band of quartz, in their cross cut at 100 feet from the northern engine shaft, which was proved to be more than 90 feet wide. It was thought from an almost perpendicular division of slate, to be a junction of the Old Man (4 feet wide) and Robinson's Reef, the latter not yet cut through \u2014 having extended their operations westward. The immense block of stone was found to be 106 feet wide, and to represent one lode only, viz., the Old Man \u2014 as at 35 feet more westerly they cut Robin son's Reef, 12 feet wide ; and further in (23 feet) they struck the Western Reef, 6 feet wide, which is here very good from present appearances. Their workings on the Eastern Keef are being extended. The stone is much improved recently, and were this reef sepa rately to be tested, the yield would be very much above present average. Criterion Company. \u2014 In their south shaft, Robinson's Reef, 13 feet wide, underlays to the west 4 feet in 50, rendering it difficult, except at great expense, to work. The usual underlay of this lode is slightly to the east, 1 in 6. I have heretofore made mention of a break in the reefs at the southern boundary of the Clunes paddock and a great apparent deviation in their course going south ; when in possession of facts, yet to be learnt from future workings, I will forward a drawing of the eccentric deviations which have happened in their course at this spot. Yield for the month (5 weeks), from 750 tons, was 337 oz. 2 dwt. : average per ton, 9 dwt. nearly. Clunes United Company. \u2014 The new shaft is down 90 feet. They have about 100 gallons of water per hour. The ground is hard. The drive on Robinson's Keef \u2014 here 20 feet wide \u2014 is in 120 feet from the north boundary. The yield is about 7 dwt. per ton. The slopes on the Eastern Reef are improving; exten ded operations are contemplated, and I am happy to say that the prospects of this mine are brightening. The machinery is in good order, having crushed 187 tons in 120 hours, yielding 55 oz. of gold. (Returns for the month not procurable.)

The reef varies from 5 to 7 feet. The metal now being raised looks richer than the quan tity tested. They have not yet struck Robinson's Reef. Yankee Company. \u2014 In their old shaft, at 250 feet, they have struck the Eastern Reef, which has a satisfactory appearance. The drive will be carried on to the Welcome Reef. Their former works in the new main shaft and also from the Sons of Justice shaft are being extended by contract. The yield for the past month is 1J oz. per ton, (hardly up with former averages). The quantities can not be stated.

The gold obtained for the month is 266 oz. 12 dwt. On the southern hill the Young Sons of Freedom continue to realize from \u00a36 to \u00a38 weekly per man. To supply their machine with water from the creek, they have recently applied pendulum power which works four pumps, having a double action, and is very speedy in effecting the object desired, one man alone performing the work. The John Bull Company and Southern Lights Company are earning wages. Both are sinking fresh shafts to work their claims.

The late rains filled the dam, the embankment settling down but slightly. It has the appearance of being an efficient work. An additional quantity of earth work is being placed on the embankment, the"], [261, "MINING SUEYEYOES' EEPOETS APEIL. 81 face of which will be stoned. Under this head I may mention that the character of alluvial mining on North Clunes is poor, which with a deficient supply of water, has forced an abandonment of claims. In that portion of my division around Creswick no new ground has been opened during the month ; but in consequence of the rain that has fallen an impetus has been given to working old ground, more especially among the Chinese population, and many of the puddling machines that were idle are now at work. With one exception, sluicing has not commenced, the quantity of rain not having been sufficient to make the creek run continuously. Most of the claims on the Red Streak continue to pay from \u00a32 to \u00a315 per man per week, and from recent indications it is hoped that a new run of gold has been struck on the hill. The Mount Hope Company have been crushing the quartz previously raised from depths of 72 aud 130 feet respectively, but have not yet declared any results. Their mining operations are partially suspended for the present. The works of the Great Eastern Company (Opossum Reef), and Gordon Parker's Com pany (Parker's Reef), are entirely suspended for the present The Victoria (Outward Bound Reef), Homeward Bound Reef, Frenchman's Reef, and Parker's Eastern Reef Companies, have not yet commenced their works. Kangaroo Reef Company are sinking a main sliaft on a new reef (Hick's) within their ground to a depth of 100 feet, with the intention of developing it at that depth. On the Kangaroo Keef they are driving north at a depth of 198 feet, where they find the reef re-forming, having lost it in that end. Its width at this place is 6 inches, increasing in thickness northwards. Evans aud Company, of Frenchman's Reef, have commenced crushing. Their machinery (one of King and Howland's patents) works most satisfactory, and crushes as much as 16 tons per day, with 12 stamps. This quantity could be considerably increased if the grating used (250 holes to the square inch) was not so fine. The company have n t cleared the bed, and cannot therefore state the result. The Spring Hill Company are raising quartz preparatory to crushing, which opera tion will commence immediately. Fisher's Reef is not being worked at preseut.

Gold was found from 1 to 3 dwt. to the tub. The wash-dirt is from 4 to 7 inches deep, and averages 6 feet wide. The sinking is dry, through a dark yellow clay.

Machinery. \u2014 There are 14 steam engines, of an aggregate of 146 horse-power ; 41 pud dling machines; 386 sluices and toms ; and 52 water wheels in this district. The estimates of the population were ori ginally taken from police returns, which at present do not vary once in from three to six months, as for instance : the population of Beech worth did not vary from 3120 for a length of time until the police had instruc tions to take a fresh census, at the instigation of the Beechworth Municipal Council, when it was at once reduced to 1760, or a little more than one-half of what it had been stated at for many months before. Machinery : \u2014 There are six puddling mills, five at work and one idle, all in the Nine mile division. During the month a small addition to the supply of water has taken place, there having been a few days wet weather ; but so far the season must be considered as a very dry one, the supply as yet not nearly equalling the demand. However, the little rain we have had has had a great effect on mining opera tions in the above-named divisions, works being actively carried on. The Nine-mile seems to have benefited the most by the supply : this is owing to the auriferous soil in that division being much easier washed, compared with that of the Yackandandah division, consequently a smaller quantity of water suffices, and a greater number of hands find employment. In the Yackandandah division as much as three (3) heads of water are frequently used in one sluice, the auri ferous dirt being of such a heavy nature as to require this large amount of water to work it. The chief hill washing in the Yackan dandah division during the month has been on the township surface hills, and the surface hills adjoining Rowdy and Osborne's Flat. The different creek claims are also in full operation, the only drawback with them being the scarcity of water till nearly 11 o'clock in the day ; this is caused by the greater portion of the water, which would naturally flow down the creek, being diverted into races and reservoirs, to enable parties to sluice the surface hills. On Allan's Flat, in the Yackandandah division, most of the claims taken up are in full work, and give employment to a large number of men. This flat is the extreme end of mining operations at present in the Yackandandah division; but claims have been taken up on the next flat, called Staghorn, and are expected to be opened in a short time. A small rush of dry sinking took place during the mouth on Kirby's Flat (Yackandandah division), but did not turn out well. The gold in these divisions is too much diffused in small quan tities through the soil to be remunerative to the dry-sinker, while it amply repays the The condition of the mines in this district is satisfactory. A large portion of them are of a shallow nature, and sluicing alone can make them pay. The remainder, with two or three exceptions, are less than 40 feet in depth. The district is divided into two well-defined portions; that part from Spring Creek north wards being of a granite, and that to the south of a schistose formation. Many of the miners who went to Snowy River have re turned, and commenced to work again here for the winter, and in many instances re gretting that they had been induced to go at all. The miners generally are steadily at work, and from the greatly increased supply of water are laboring to greater advantage than during the summer. At Bowman's Forest seven claims only are paying, the rest have been unable to discover the lead ; but these seven have proved so remunerative that the other claims shortly after they are abandoned are taken up by fresh parties. At Mopoke Gully they are still working with spirit ; several of the claims have been bought up by the Chinese, who had been working for the original holders. The wages of the Chinese (a considerable number of whom are hired by Europeans) is six shillings per day. At Pennyweight Flat the puddling machines are on the increase, from 4 to 11; this is in consequence of the supply of water having increased. The One, Two, and Three Mile Creeks are being worked steadily. At the El Dorado mining is going on favorably, but this deep sinking (wet) takes a considerable time before it is opened up, being nothing but disintegrated granite. There is no quartz mining going on. Several attempts have been made to open veins, but the poverty of one has stopped proceedings. [Mr. Grimes has furnished a plan of Hurdle Creek.] Europeans.

The junction of the Caledonian, Durham, and Devonshire Leads, have not yet been defined; but the claims on those leads towards the junction are still producing good dividends to the men working them. The Kincardineshire Lead produces a good average throughout its length \u2014 several claims will return over \u00a315 per week per man. Its coincidence with the Durham, of which it is in reality the upper part, is satisfactorily proved. A supposed new lead, called the Victoria, was struck last month. It lies west of the lower part of the Durham, towards the Black Dog Creek. The depth of the prospect shaft is 178 feet, and the wash-dirt is about 2 feet in thickness. On being first prospected it was anticipated that it would run about 1 oz. to the load ; but a recent washing from the prospect hole, only produced 13 oz. to about 29 loads. The lead has not been struck in any other claim yet; and among the miners generally the Victoria at present is not favorably looked on. Indigo Division. (Thomas E. Thornely, Mining Surveyor.)

There are two more engines in course of erection, and several others in course of erection, by private quartz companies composed of three or four good paying claims being amalgamated, which system is becoming popular on Ben digo, and it is the only true method of suc cess. Birds Reef. \u2014 Four claims have amalga mated on this line and formed themselves into a private company with a capital of \u00a33000 as a set off, in 60 shares of \u00a3100 each, 30 of which shares are to be given to the claim holders. They are in treaty for an engine, and have stone enough to last them for two or three years. Le Capelain's Company to the south have crushed some very good stone, but have not been able to work regularly in consequence of the many unforeseen disarrangements which constantly occur on the erection of new machinery. Some of the intermediate private claims are getting some very remu nerative stone. Mr Wright's claim to the north of the Birds Reef Company has been constantly at work for the last two years. He has a beautiful little 4 horse-power engine kept constantly at work crushing the top stone. The yield is under 1 oz. per ton generally, but at times some very rich stone is found. The top reefs to the south of Bendigo Flat are generally very patchy, but often exceedingly rich, and I am of opinion that the reefs lying deeper or underneath the top stone and below water level will be more regular and not so patchy. Mining in all its branches is looking better this month. The puddlers have a good supply of water without having their workings flooded, and, consequently, are enabled to work in the best ground, some of which has never been got at before now. Very few mills are being erected, but those we have at work employ nearly double the number of men as formerly, owing to the late increase in puddling claims awarded by the late Mining Board. There have been several new and distinct bodies of quartz discovered in and around Bendigo this month. One body of quartz was struck in a drive about 40 feet below the surface, in au old claim on the Wilson Reef, parallel and adjoining the Cooper's Maiden Claim, Redan Hill, which yielded 215 oz. of gold to 2 tons of quartz. Another was found on Johnston's Reef which gave even a greater return, and two in the Break o' Day, Glasgow Reef. \u2014 The pumping engine is nearly completed, and the claims to the north and south of it are briskly engaged in sinking their main shafts for the extraction of quartz, Europeans.

The water level here is about 110 feet. stone from his claim to the north of the company's ground. He is crushing his own quartz and doing very well. All the other lines are more or less at work, and getting gold ; but reefing is not as we could wish it, nor will it be until a liberal and efficient drainage act is made, and passed through the House. They have the idea that the Mining Board bye-laws are illegal, and liable at any time to be upset. Therefore the miners care not to invest their capital in drainage with out protection. Fagg and Company have been constantly taking up stone from a depth of 75 feet, which has averaged 5 oz. per ton. They are raising about 10 tons per week. Ness and Co., to the east, have crushed about 14 tons, averaging 3\u00a3 ozs. per ton. The claim to the north of this has got upon the same run of stone, equally rich. The Golden Gully Company have been constantly at work, stone yielding about 1 oz. per ton. The United Glasgow Reef Company are making active preparations for a start. They have plenty of stone, the reef not having been as yet touched to the south, owing to its being below the water level. The Diamond Hill Company are again at work, following down the stone on the western reef. This and Schilling's Claim to the north, keep their crushing machine constantly at work. The yeld is not so great as formerly, but still very payable. The price of crushing for quartz remains stationary, generally at \u00a31 per ton. At Epsom cement is crushed at 12s. The Glasgow Reef Pumping and Crushing Com pany^ intend reducing the price to 15s. per ton ; but I think we shall shortly see it down to 10s. Eaglehawk Division. (G. W. Dart, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows: \u2014 Sarnia Reef. \u2014 The German amalgamated claims are doing well. They have got upon a body of stone of great thickness, which they call the main reef. Skene and Company to the north intend to sink about 170 feet where they expect to strike the main reef. They have nearly obtained that level already. Sheep's Head Reef, \u2014The Union Company on this line have a very extensive claim, and employ a number of men. They are working the various runs of payable stone in the sur face reef. They crush their own stone as well as for the public. They have made extensive excavations underground, and extracted thou sands of tons of stone, averaging generally 1 ounce ; and at timesit is very rich (patchy).

It is now at work, and perceptibly draining the line. The pump shaft is 22 feet deep; but the reef is supposed to be 30 feet deeper, and until the stone is cut little drain age can be effected. The pumps are in the shaft of the Caledonian Company. New Chum \u2014 The New Chum Company's engine is almost complete, meantime they are extracting some very good stone from the Kllcsmere claim.

The numerous patches of pay able ground that have been opened at inter vals along several miles of this creek, confirm me in my belief that there is still a large quantity of payable ground at present un worked. similar machines in the old gullies. The returns of gold from the reefs are likely to increase, as some of the pumping engines will shortly come into operation, and on those reefs where they are at work the draining of the claims has been attended with such beneficial results that there is no doubt but that the practice of contributing to a fund for the erection of pumping machinery will become general. Many of the holders of quartz claims have stated to me that such is their intention. The Strath Creek, since the removal of Mr. Sloane's crushing machine to Muddy Creek, may be considered as deserted ; all the claims there being either registered or abandoned. King Parrot Creek. \u2014 The few quartz claims at work on the Triangle Line are still yielding an average of 2 oz. to the ton. One claim, however, greatly exceeds this average, having crushed 12J oz. to the ton : the rubbish, casing, &c. from this claim has also given payable results. The large body of water still present on this line has proved an in superable obstacle to many of the original claim-holders, who in consequence have left for other fields. On Hannigan's Line 1 oz. to the ton has been realized from a thick body of stone, lying to the east of the reef, and at only a few feet from the surface. Mr. Lortune, who has applied for four acres of the aban doned ground on the Triangle Line, intends erecting pumping machinery, for draining the reef; when this is done, I believe, a very large proportion of the claims now abandoned will again be profitably worked. As none of the works now in progress have been completed within the last month, I know of nothing of any importance or worthy of record. Kilmore Division. (F. M. Hill, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows Muddy Creek. \u2014 The two lines of reef being worked here are still giving a very handsome return, 13 J- oz. to the ton having been realized from the Carriers' Reef, and 7 oz. to the ton from the Providence Reef.

The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Several claim-holders on this bill have amalgamated, and are putting a tunnel through the hill at a depth of 90 feet from the summit ; the work is being well carried on, and if persevered in will be the best means of testing the true value of the ground. At the Tea-tree and Junction, quartz mi ning is still progressing favorably, although on the former field complaints are made of the scarcity of crushing machinery; this want however will be shortly supplied, as Mr. Hart, from Reedy Creek, is erecting powerful machinery to be worked by water power. Joiners' Claim, on the Tea-tree, is still yielding well, besides which may be mentioned the East and West Reef, Taylor's, Euniskillen, and others. The greatest depression in quartz mining matters still exists on Reedy Creek ; owing partly to a large number of miners having left for Inglewood and the Snowy River, as well as to the presence of large quantities of water on the various payable reefs already opened here. The returns from the small quantity of quartz crushed during the past month, although not so great as formerly, are still sufficient to induce me to think that this field is far seqjpa exhausted. A few parties are still working the alluvial ground on the Tea-tree Creek. They are piling the washdirt, and I believe intend erecting a puddling machine as soon as their claim is worked. There is a considerable improvement in alluvial mining; a small rush having taken place on the flats adjoining the creek, near Alluvial Miners.

Quartz mining continues to be the main resource of the division, Long Creek and its neighborhood being the principal place. The various auriferous reefs in this quarter are being worked with usual energy and prospects, and machinery for their efficient working is steadily on the increase. Three Mining Lease Companies are at work ; viz., the Poverty Reef Company, the Greek Hill and Wilson Reef Company, and the Stony Reef Company. The first named have their main shaft sunk to a depth of 260 feet, and their engine is at work bailing and winding. They expect to strike the main reef at 270 feet. The Greek Hill and Wilson Reef Company have as yet no machinery. They are busily engaged in getting out quartz and putting their mines in working order. They have had a trial crushing of 50 tons, which yielded 8 dwt. per ton. The Stony Reef Company's machinery is nearly erected, and in a few weeks' time will com mence to crush the large quantity of stone they have ready, On the north end of Poverty Reef an amalgamated claim of Messrs. Beynon and Company has a pro specting shalt sunk to a depth of 360 feet, at which depth the influx of water has suddenly become so great that it is generally supposed they are in close proximity to the main reef. This is the deepest shaft in the division, and the intention is to carry it down to 400 feet before driving, if no reef be struck before arriving at that depth. Korong Division.

Korong. \u2014 Mining operations have improved here during the month owing to the late rains. Several parties are out, and small rushes have taken place in consequence ; but only to a small extent of new ground has been opened. Almost all the puddling mills have been pretty steadily engaged, and are likely to be constantly employed while water is to be had. At Cay's in consequence of most of the shareholders being at Inglewood, nearly all the reefs are registered with the exception of an extended claim on American Reef, on which the proprietors are arranging to erect machinery ; none having as yet been erected on any reef iu this place. Quartz mining has remained very dull. The large and powerful machinery lately erected in the Main Flat, has stopped working, owing to some disagreement of the shareholders. One of the other crushing machines has been removed for re-erection on the Loddon adja cent to Inglewood. At Moliagul, the only company at work is the Queen's, a co-operative company holding their ground under the regulations of the district (not as a lease.) They have a 25 borse-power engine and crush with stampers. I am unable to report as to their results. Fenton's and Synnott's diggings are ex tremely dull, the few miners remaining being ,chiefly employed in the old workings. A quartz vein has been discovered between the latter place and Jordan's, but has not yet been tested to any depth sufficient to prove its being remunerative; although stone sup posed to yield about Joz. per ton has been obtained on the surface. At Jordan's and Jericho a few of the abandoned claims have At Jones's Creek the only company there have suspended operations, I am informed, through want of unanimity among the shareholders, as the prospects were en couraging.

The German Reef has yielded a large amount of quartz during the month, and some good returns are expected. At Skipper's Gully (Jordan's) one party obtained about 261bs. weight of gold in nug gets, which will most likely lead to the discovery of more auriferous ground in the neighborhood. At Kingower the Union Reef is yielding payable quartz, and preparations are going on for the purpose of testing its value to a greater depth ; hut the great influx of water, combined with the hardness of the rock, ren ders it a very slow process. From the Bon accord Reef, Long Gully, a lot of 20 tons was crushed, which yielded about 1 oz. per ton. I expect a great depth will have to be attained previous to the discovery of any main reef. The few alluvial miners are mostly engaged in surfacing new ground adjoining Tumbler's Hill and McKenzie's Gully. At the latter place several good finds have taken place. The largest nugget I know of weighed 96 oz., others of far greater weight are reported as having been got. I heard of one piece weigh ing about 200 oz., but have not been able to trace the report to the discoverer. Several prospecting parties are out, and I expect soon to learn of fresh discoveries. neighborhood of the reef. Should there not be more deep ground opened on this place soon, a considerable decrease may be expected in the population ; the shallow ground being soon worked out by so large a population. A nugget weighing 188 oz. was obtained on the surface lately ; but the precise locality is not reported yet. CASTLEMAINE MINING DISTRICT. Taradale Division. (Thomas Turner, Mining Surveyor.) The Taradale Gold Field embraces the valley of the Coliban River, which river takes its rise about twelve miles west of the township of Woodend in the Great Dividing Range. The above river pursues a course of about north by east, for a distance of probably forty miles, when it falls into the Campaspe at a point about ten miles east of Mount Alex ander. This valley is bounded on the west by rugged ranges of schistose formation running north and south, dividing the valleys of the Coliban and Loddon Rivers. Inglewood has been somewhat duller for several weeks, although rushes have taken place weekly. An extension rush took place about the middle of the month, to a large flat situated about one mile from New Inglewood, at which place I marked off a street, and allotments for business sites, by order of the Warden. It has, however, resulted in a com plete failure for the present, only a few claims having yielded payable gold. The deepleads at Old and New Inglewood are steadily progress ing, and in many instances splendid results are being obtained. Several new reefs or veins have also been discovered. From the Ingle wood and Welcome Reefs good crushings have taken place. At Kingower water has been found on the former reef, at a depth of about 186 feet, and the owners of the claim have registered it, being unable at present to con tend with the hard sinking and water. Should a large supply of water be found by sinking to a greater depth, it would be valuable for mining purposes. The steam pumping engine lately erected on the Loddon is supplying about 20 puddling machines and 100 toms situated on the Sandy or Bulla Bulla Creek, where the greater portion of the auriferous stuff obtained near New Inglewood is washed. A large population has congregated around the washing place. I intend, as soon as possible, to send a plan of the works at this place. A small crushing machine is being erected near the washing place; tobeworked by horse power. Extensive crushing machinery is al ready required on this field, situated in the To the eastward of the Coliban the country displays two distinct characteristics ; that to the northward being of schistose ranges, in dicating a gold country ; and that to the southward trappean plains. At a point midway of the Coliban's length it receives a tributary stream from the west ward, called the Back Creek, and at half a mile from the junction, where the Melbourne main road crosses this creek, stands the town of Taradale, where late in the year 1853 the first gold workings began. Along the valley of the creek, for a dis tance of about three miles from the town ship, it has been extensively worked for gold. Report always affirmed that the gold lay in patches, there being no continuous lead the depth of the sinking varying from 5 to 20 feet, the gold being commonly coarse with small nuggets occasionally. This ground is now nearly abandoned by the digger, but companies are taking it up. About a quarter of a mile up the stream from Taradale bridge the Albion Company have a 6 horse-power steam engine tunning a cylinder on the principle of Hart's pa tent. A steam engine of 12 horse-power has also been erected immediately below the bridge, with a Hart's patent puddling machine, but the work at present is at a stand. B"], [270, "MINING SUBYEYOES' BEPOETS \u2014 APEIL. 90 Further up the creek, about three miles from Taradale, the Coliban Company have their works at a place which is designated the Ironstone Hill. At this place the miners traced a lead of gold under an arm of the trap-rock formations (which is locally called ironstone), and the Coliban Company have taken up the position, and driven two tunnels under the hills, one on each side of the creek. The same parties have erected commodious premises on the spot, with also a 12 horse-power engine which turns three puddling machines. About three miles further south brings one to a small stream, another tributary of the Coliban, which joins that river near the town of Malmsbury. It is called the Kan garoo Creek ; where there is a rich quartz reef, known as the Frenchman's. This reef was abandoned some time ago, when three ounces of gold from a ton of quartz would not pay : report says that even as much as eleven ounces per ton have been obtained. Two companies have taken up extended claims on this abandoned reef, and have tun nelled far into the hill, one of them 260 feet to the reef. One company has a steam engine already crushing quaitz, and the other is about to erect one. Several horse-puddling machines have been erected in the valley of the creek, but the want of water last summer stopped all such operations, and only two instances exist of these works having been resumed. A quarter of a mile higher up the Kangaroo Creek there is another gold producing reef where two parties are working most san guinely. Their workings are called the Old South Hill in contradistinction to the Old Kangaroo Hill, which is further north. This hill is abandoned, although it gave good signs of a gold-bearing reef being at hand. Three miles south-west of Taradale a rich quartz reef was struck last December. There are now ten shafts going down. It has been named the Humboldt. Two claims had gold on the surface. Various crushings from this reef have yielded as follows, viz. : \u2014 7-J tons of quartz yielded 42 oz. ; 2 tons yielded 3\u00a3 oz. 18 dwt. ; 20 tons from a vein four feet thick, all crushed, produced 1J oz. to the ton ; 4 tons of refuse quartz yielded 64 oz. 16 dwt. This last crushing was assayed, and the gold proved 23 carats fine. Two miles or thereabouts bring the traveller to the Coliban River Diggings, situated about three miles south-west of Malmsbury, but little is doing there now, though once a busy spot. From specimens of quartz bearing gold which have been picked up in the bed of the river, there can be little doubt but that a rich vein exists in the neighborhood. There is a water-power mill erected_at _the place for crushing quartz. Immediately north from the township of Taradale there is a rock quartz reef, known formerly as Hughes' Reef, which has been worked for gold for the last five years. At present it is the property of the Prince Albert Company, who have extensive buildings, with machinery erected. They have a 12 horse-power engine driving a battery of eight wet stampers, and a pair of Chilian wheels. The shaft is now 220 feet deep, and the quartz vein 26 feet thick. On account of the works having changed hands, the machinery lay idle for several months, and having only lately been resumed, the crushings have been refuse stuff, consequently it has not yielded anything worthy of note, but there are great indications of future good returns. About ten miles higher up the river in Clowes Forest there was a rush last summer to some auriferous alluvium. Many diggers are working there still, and a rumor is abroad that a quartz reef bearing gold has been found. The various places that I have enumerated above (as the chief places where mining opera tions have been conducted on this side of the Taradale field) all lay along the eastern flank of that remarkable range of schistose rocks whose western slopes produced the gold which enriched the gullies of both Fryer's and Forest Creeks. The Taradale side of these ranges has been but little pro spected. They abound in quartz reefs, and many specimens of quartz bearing gold have been picked up in very many places amongst these hills. There is a horse-puddling machine working ground on private lands near this quarter with good results. Following up the line of gold mining opera tions in a southerly course from Taradale, about four miles distant from the township, we come to the Bell-topper Hill, where a quartz reef seems to exist, but from the broken nature of the leaders (as the miners term the small veins of quartz) no great results have arisen ; still a few miners are fossicking about, i.e., perseveringly exploring the abandoned shafts, in hopes of discovering some new indication of a rich deposit of the precious metal. I have now to consider the country to the eastward of the Coliban River. That portion of this field which lies north-east from Tara dale fully indicates its auriferous character, but it has been but little tested. About seven miles from the town in an east and north direction, rise some very steep ranges of shale and sandstone whose smooth"], [271, "MINING SUBYEYOES' BEPOETS \u2014 APEIL. 91 slopes and rounded summits present very little protruding rock, it having been disin tegrated under the influence of the atmos phere, giving these ranges quite a different appearance to those rocky ridges on the west side of the Coliban ; even the vegetation tends to establish the distinctive character, the eastern ranges being only thinly wooded with box and gum trees, whilst the western are thickly timbered with the stringy-bark kinds. enumerate the following statistics, viz. : \u2014 There are five reefs being worked with good success, and eight more working that show gold ; besides two other gold-bearing reefs known, situated on private property. There are six steam engines erected, five of which are working ; and another is about to be erected. There is also a water mill for crushing quartz, and three horse-puddling machines. These eastward ridges have been named Barfold Ranges. There have not been any alluvial diggings in that locality; but seven reefs have been struck, all gold-bearing, and three of them giving handsome returns. A steam engine of 12 horse-power has been erected at the place, with a battery of eight stampers, and a pair of Chilian wheels. It is difficult to estimate the number of the population that are engaged in mining opera tions in this division of the gold fields ; I should think there must be at least 1500. St. Andrew's Division. The proprietor furnished me with some statements of crushings, viz.: \u2014 90 tons of quartz yielded 125 oz. 16 dwt. of gold; 15\u00a3 tons yielded 20 oz. 5 dwt. ; 16 tons yielded 36 oz. 10 dwt. ; and 5 tons of quartz yielded 3 oz. 3 dwt. of gold. (James Murphy, Mining Surveyor ) The mining population is as follows : \u2014 I have yet to notice the Coliban River itself, which sufficiently proves the highly auriferous character of the country through which it flows. From its junction with the Campaspe up to the town of Taradale it has been searched nearly through the whole length of its channel for gold, and many a good yield has its pools afforded when emptied during the summer months. One party is said to have taken as much gold out of one pool as gave a dividend of \u00a3800 to each man engaged. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The small alluvial flats along the river's banks in many places, have been wrought out and yielded well, yet no breadth of country on either side has been worked. Many Chinese and also Europeans, are still busily employed in these flats. The lands along the Coliban River above Taradale, as far up as the old Coliban diggings, (before described, are situated three miles above^Malmsbury), are all private pro perty, consequently gold seeking has not been prosecuted in that quarter. The approximate value of all the mining plant within the division is \u00a37950. I regret being obliged to draw attention to the very great decrease which has occurred in the number of miners iu this division during the past month, as a glance at the accom panying tables will show, and which is owing to the rush to Inglewood, from which a few have already returned, bringing anything but encouraging accounts of their success from that gold field. However, there are a few of the miners here still bent upon trying their fortunes at Inglewood, and leaving fully as good, if not better chances behind them, The tract of country lying between the Coliban River and the Back Creek is of trap rock formatiou ; at four points on the Back Creek the gold has been traced under this formation, thereby supporting the idea that much gold in alluvial leads, is probably buried beneath this volcanic deposit. As a summary statement of the mining operations that are being carried on in this division of the Castlemaine Gold Fields, I may Europeans.

I think that many weeks will not have passed hy, when there will be an increase in the number of miners on this gold field, for this reason\u2014 that here the miner can always earn a living, and therefore the return of most, if not of all those who have left this locality may very reasonably be expected. The proceedings of this company are of the greatest interest in this division, inasmuch as it is traversed by the River Yarra for several hundred miles, on which, I have no doubt, many such companies will be established during the next summer if this company suc ceeds, of which, under proper management in the working, I have no doubt. With respect to mining affairs generally, T beg to state that notwithstanding the decrease in population they have rather an encouraging aspect than otherwise, inasmuch as quartz mining, with few exceptions, where steadily pursued is yielding and promises to yield a steady and high rate of profit both to capital ists and to individual miners. The individual miner however as yet feels that the rate charged for crushing his quartz is too high, and is compelled. in many cases, after the trouble and expense of mining, to reject quartz that would remunerate him for his labor were the expenses of crushing and cartage within such reasonable limits as would allow a profit to the miner from a yield of from one and a half to two ounces to the ton. At Whipstick Gully, Anderson's Creek, Doctor Owen's machine has been completed and has had a trial. It is able to puddle a cubic yard of tough clay every two minutes, leaving the stones and gravel perfectly clean and from the peculiar construction of the machinery itself, and its having a Russian cradle attached, I have no doubt that it saves all the gold. Mining operations are at present practically suspended on the Yarra Yarra Steam Puddling Company's claim while a culvert is being put in for the purpose of draining the workings. At Anderson's Creek there are at present but ten quartz miners, four of whom are in the employment of Mr. Wilkinson ; the other six are working claims on their own account. At Morang the number of miners is re duced to about twelve. The gully recently opened there being nearly worked out, and prospecting on ground known to be auriferous, in the neighborhood, prevented on account of its being private property. Were there a cheap and efficient means of extracting gold from quartz on that gold field, its condition would be far superior lo what it is. Both the Nicholson and the Emerald Gold Fields are deserted. In alluvial mining at Anderson's Creek, there are only three individual miners em ployed at present. The greatest number of miners in the eastern part of the division are on Hoddle's Creek, where there are about 60 miners now at work. About 60 more are scattered about between the Britannia Creek, Yankee Jim's Creek, and the Scotchman's Creek. I do not think that prospecting will be carried on to any extent in that part of the division during the winter months, owing to the wetness of the locality and the difficulty of transporting provisions, even on horseback, from the swampy nature of the ground in very many places. The Yarra Yarra Mining Company have their machinery completed and in full opera tion. The machinery employed consists of a steam engine of about 8 horse-power, which works a pair of lift pumps, drives a Start's patent puddling machine, with a Russian cradle attached, and draws the washing-stuff across the river up an inclined tramway from the bottom of the river at the right bank, to a height of about 30 feet above the level of the river bed at the left bank, where it is delivered into the puddling machine at the rate of about two cubic yards per hour. The arrangement of the machinery for conveying and delivering the washing-stuff to the machine is every way adapted to the pur pose, and does its work with admirable precision. It consists of a drum thrown in and out of gear by a coupling, and a brake to retard the motion of the drum, and even stop it, if required, when the truck attached to it is descending the incline. The bottom of the Prospecting parties are out in the country between the Yan Yean and Queenstown, and also between the northern part of the Caledonia Gold Field and Steel's Creek, but there are no discoveries as yet. A steam puddling machine is about to be erected about a mile and a half from Queenstown, on the Old Caledonia Creek. At One Tree Hill the Smyth's Creek Quartz Mining Company (Holmes, Piandlc,"], [273, "MINING SUBYEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 APEIL. 93 Ricards, and Company) have struck a reef 3 feet thick in one of their trial shafts, at a depth of 60 feet; gold is visible in the quartz but the yield is not known yet. from the Sons of Freedom Claim ; but as it is nearly worked out, they expect to remove it shortly. On Cathcart those still at work are making wages. [Mr. Murpby has furnished a plan and sections of Whiskey Gully.] Pleasant Creek. \u2014 On this division the reefs are progressing steadily. On the Cross Reef there are from 2000 to 3000 tODS raised, ready for crushing ; and it is expected that these will turn out as well, if not better, than any former crushings. Messrs. Davidson and Co. had half a ton crushed on trial lately, which yielded the large amount of 127 ounces. In some parts the reef exceeds 14 feet in thick ness. As much as 600 ounces have been obtained from 160 tons of quartz. ARARAT MINING DISTRICT. Ararat, Pleasant Creek, and Raglan Divisions. (John G. Wilson, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows : \u2014 The New Chum Reef is beginning to im prove, and shares in it are rising in proportion. Scotchman's Reef is likewise looking better.

Alluvial. \u2014 The rush to the Forty-foot, which I mentioned in my last, has not turned out so well as was expected ; but a few of the miners are making wages. Cement has been obtained from it which has yielded from 6 and 7 to 8 oz. to the ton. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Campbell's. \u2014 This reef is steadily im proving. In Matthews and Kennedy's claim the reef has been found 6 feet in thickness, and stone has been crushed from it which has yielded as much as 6 oz. to the ton. A new reef has been discovered, about a mile-and-a half to the southward and westward of the present reef, which has been named Moon light Reef. From the cap of the reef, in the prospecting claim, stone has been obtained which yielded when crushed 12 dwt. to the ton ; and as it has been proved throughout this district, that the deeper the reef is the richer it becomes, there is every probability of this new reef turning out one of the best in the district. I believe that the whole of the country between this portion of the district and the Grampian Range is highly auriferous. The ranges consist of trap-rock, interspersed with quartz and large quantities of burnt ironstone clay.

Ararat. \u2014 These diggings have improved considerably in consequence of the late rain. A new rush has taken place to Opossum Gully, and a fair yield of gold is being ob tained. On Commissioner's Hill, West Lead, there has not been much doing lately, in con sequence of most of the claims having been swamped out by water during the late rains. The sinking is very hard, consisting of what may be termed cellular bluestone, succeeded by a body of heavy tough clay. Most of the claims are down between 60 and 70 feet. Two claims have amalgamated for the pur pose of keeping down the water, which in this particular place has very nearly beat the miners out. Most of the miners there, how ever, are sanguine of success. A great majo rity of the claims belong to the Chinese, and they are most persevering. On the Black Lead there is one steam en gine of 12 horse-power, pumping and winding The new company proposed to be started for the better working six of the claims on the original reef has been formed, and they intend shortly to have a 25 horse-power engine on the ground.

Out of be tween 70 and 80 claims there are only 8 at work ; the stone raised, from some of which has yielded only 1\u00a3 oz. to the ton, which will not pay on account of the difficulty experi enced in getting the quartz, and also the in ferior quality of the gold. A company is about to be formed for the purpose of work ing some of the claims which have amalga mated, and such I believe will be the only method by which the reef can be made to pay.

A prospecting associa tion has been started by a few of the enter prising people on the township, but as yet with no beneficial result.

I have the honor to report, that during the past month the Southern Cross Company, Inkermann Lead, has struck the second rock, at a depth of 180 feet, and are now sinking in it : from the fact of this company having struck the second lock at so great a depth, 1 am led to believe that the course of the Inkermann Lead continues in a westerly direction, and that it reaches a considerable distance before joining the Golden Point Lead.

Quartz Reefs. \u2014 Two new claims for quartz mining have been taken up during the past month, viz., the Invincible Company on the Milkmaid's Keef, and the Star of Temperance Company on the Cemetery Reef; the first company consists of 40 men, and the latter company consists of 53 men ; there is also a company consisting of 12 men, named the Wendowree Company, which has started to sink near the swamp for a quartz tees. The Township Quartz Mining Company has sus pended its crushing operations during the greater part of the past month in consequence of its being engaged in sinking a new shaft and filling in old levels. At the present time there is a strong inclination amongst both miners and storekeepers to enter into quartz mining operations. The recently in troduced principle of permitting companies to work their claims by contract has tended very much to facilitate the formation of com panies for carrying on mining operations. Sago Hill. \u2014 The richness of some of the claims on the top of this hill, the peculiarity of the strata, and the texture of the bed-rock, together with its dip in a northerly direction, are strong grounds upon which to base the opinion that a rich lead exists in a northerly direction from this hill. The great quantity of water met with in sinking, and the in efficiency of the machinery employed retard the development of the richness of this lo cality. Four are in course of erection. Approximate value of all mining plant within the division, \u00a370,000. In forwarding my report for the present month, I have much pleasure in stating the highly prosperous condition of quartz mining within my district. I have already reported that very great attention is being given to this branch of mining, and at the present time a still larger amount of capital is being invested in machinery, and greater energy shown in the prospecting of the lodes which are known to exist on this gold field. During the last month I have laid off 28 quartz claims within my district, most of which are on the supposed courses of lodes known to exist in other places, or due north and south from the places in which the lodes have been already worked.

The width of the lode varies from 8 to 20 feet, and the quartz is raised from depths varying from 20 to 150 feet. The cost of crushing and raising a ton of quartz is estimated by this company at 14s. The progress of quartz mining in this district is the more satisfactory a3 a smaller yield of gold per ton is made to pay them than on any other gold field. The Cornish United Company have a bat tery of 12 stamps on the Gum Tree Flat ; \u2014 and have averaged \u00a38 to \u00a39 per man weekly since they commenced work, but as the com pany have not kept an account of the quan tity of quartz crushed, I am unable to state the average yield. This information I shall be able to supply in my next report, as the company are about to make an account of the work done and the yield of gold obtained. The great attention that has been paid to crushing machinery and quartz mining has enabled the miners to realize a profit from quartz which a few years ago would have been thrown away as quite useless for crush ing purposes. Though at the present time there are doubtless many defects in the machinery employed and the methods of working, an immense advancement has been made both in the theoretical and practical portions of the operations carried on. The Llanhenis Company have a battery of 12 stamps also on the Gum Tree Flat : esti mate the cost of raising and crushing at from 14s. to 18s. per ton. The following statistics of claims now actually at work will show that very poor quartz can be made to yield a profit, even where the quantity of gold per ton is far below what has been usually considered a paying average. The Enterprise Company have a batteiy of 8 stamps in the same locality, and have ob tained during the last month \u00a330 per man weekly for the first three weeks, and \u00a326 for the last week. The fact that quartz of so poor a nature can be profitably worked is a most cheering one, as there is, not only on this gold field but on many others, a very large quantity of quartz that will yield an average far higher than that which has been made to pay here. The Last Chance Company have a battery of 8 stamps in Specimen Gully. This com pany estimate the cost of raising and crushing at 13s. per ton, from a lode 14 feet in width, and from a depth of 70 feet. The following account of several claims in my district will afford the best sample I can give of the progress of quartz mining during the last six months. The average yield of gold per ton of quartz has been 6 dwt. 18 gr. From these figures it will be seen that the work is now done at a far lower rate than was deemed to be pos sible a short time ago, and there is a proba bility of even a further decrease in the cost of working. Tredennick and party, holding a claim on the Golden Point lode, have a battery of 16 stampers. The average yield of the quartz during the last month has only been 3 dwt. 6 gr. per ton, and the average yield has not been higher during at least twice the period mentioned. The manager of the company states that even with this low yield the ope ration is a profitable one, and the fact that the company is constantly at work is sufficient proof of the truth of the assertion. The quartz is taken from the lode and reduced to a size suitable for stamping, and conveyed to the bottom of the shaft at the rate of 4s. per ton. The total expense of raising and crush ing 175 tons does not exceed \u00a3100, thus leaving a profit at the low yield named, and showing a total cost of 11s. 6d. per ton for raising and crushing. The lode varies in width from 4 feet to 15 feet, and the quartz is taken from depths varying from 50 leet to 170 feet. The average price now charged for crush ing in this district is 15s. per ton for quantities not less than 50 tons ; for a smaller quantity the price charged is \u00a31 per ton. In alluvial mining there is no change since my last report. One fact is, however, worthy of remark, namely, that this winter no sluicing has been carried on in my district. Descriptions op Plans and Sections : \u2014 I beg to forward plans and sections of the Cornish United Company, on the Gum Tree Flat. This company have at present a battery of 12 stampers for quartz crushing, but purpose to erect an additional battery of 8 stamps. Peake and party, on the same lode, have a battery of 16 stampers.

Whim Holes. \u2014 Matters here are much about the same as already reported \u2014 the Progressive Company have put in a drive, or level 130 feet from their shaft, and have not yet reached the gutter, however in another week or so very probably they will have done so. The ground is expected to be very difficult to work, owing to the great quantity of bottom water, and the very loose nature of the earth overlying the wash-dirt ; how ever, should it be found even tolerably rich in the precious metal this quiet locality will, ere long, be the scene of a very large rush, as the sinking will be comparatively easy and inexpensive, the depth being only about 120 feet. The gully mentioned was opened some four years since, and then found more than ordinarily rich ; it never has been properly worked, as the population of the district are of too migratory habits, and I may add, too poor, to work it in a systematic or efficient manner, or to thoroughly prospect the sur rounding country. However, as will be seen by the plan, there are three dams and puddling machines pre sently at work in the gully, and, as I under stand, all doing very fairly. One party, however, have recently sold their claim, dam, and puddling machine, to some China men for \u00a3120, with a view of starting for the Snowy River diggings at the opening of Spring ; and from all I can learn it appears there will be by that time a large exodus from the district, unless some new ground be opened up in the meantime, which I fear_is not very likely, as the miners are so circum stanced throughout the greater part of the division, that they cannot of themselves afford to prospect five weeks in succession without returning to some old ground or gully, in order to try and recruit their ex hausted funds. The shallow ground higher up the gully near the Little Hard Hills, alluded to in my last, continues to pay fair wages ; I believe there are about 100 men employed there, and the sinking about 12 or 15 feet, There is nothing of much interest to be reported of the deep rock leads in the divi sion, all of which are getting on very slowly indeed. One company however (the Red Jacket) on the White Horse Lead, has recently got some first rate prospects after some four years or upwards of preliminary labor, as much as 160 or 170 ounces being obtained from a machine of wash-dirt ; but, unfortunately, no sooner had these good prospects dawned on them than litigation springs up that is likely to be of an expen sive and protracted nature, between them selves and an adjoining company on the Frenchman's Lead, touching the respective rights of the parties to the after-junction or trunk lead, both leads having juuctioued inside the disputed ground, and no provision made in the bye-laws of 1856, when the claims were registered, for such a contin gency. I mentioned in my last report that I expected to know ere this the result of the crushings at the Midland Counties and Ger manic Confederation Companies' batteries at Mount Misery Creek and Pinchgut, but as yet there is nothing reliable or interesting known. However, before the date of my next report, it is almost certain both com panies will be in full work, but with what results remains to be told, though very san guine hopes are entertained of remunerative yields at both places. The old worked gullies in the neighborhood of Mount Misery, Italian Gully, Paddy's Gully, &c, are merely affording subsistence to the few parties working on them, which is just what may be expected seeing that some of them have been already two or three times \" turned over,\" though it is very generally believed the district referred to abounds in undiscovered auriferous ground, both alluvial and quartz, but owing to the want of money there it has remained un touched, and very likely will so remain a good while longer, unless some means be devised or assistance given towards supplementing the efforts of the poor miners of the district. On Staffordshire Reef, matters still remain quiet, though the few companies at work are obtaining very satisfactory dividends ; the gross result of the crushings at the mill of Porter and Company, from 15th August to 13th May last, was 2548 oz. from 3369 tons, or a little more than 15 dwt. per ton, which is considered now-a-days very satisfactory.

No. 5, on Buninvonu Division. (James W. R. Pringle, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 In addition to the above there are 500 un registered miners. With the exception of the Perseverance Company on the White Horse, and Anderson and party on the All Nations, the companies in occupation of claims on the reefs have not had time to obtain any amount of quartz for crushing. They are all, however, busily engaged iu sinking. The machinery is as follows The Perseverance Company, owing to un avoidable delay, has only crushed 100 tons this month ; the yield averaged 10 dwt. to a ton, at a depth of 145 feet, and from a width of 25 feet. The All Nations Company has crushed about 120 tons, from different d-pths, at an average of 10 dwt. per ton; but it is neces sary to state that all the fine quartz had been previously screened out, and a considerable amount of gold obtained from it. I have the honor to forward you a brief general report of my division for the month of May, accompanied by plan, sections, and report of my proposed scheme for a water supply. During this month quartz mining has con tinued to gain importance, and claims on the various reefs have been eagerly applied for and taken possession of, in most cases, by large companies. Very little ground now remains unoccupied between my northern boundary and Buninyong Township ; and I am glad to state that applications arc being made for reefs south of the present occupied line. The amount marked off on quartz reefs, during the month, under Schedule 10, Bye-law XL, is 17,405 lineal feet, and under the Leasing Regulations is 5400 feet. The impetus now given to quartz mining has been most bene ficial in detaining in this locality many who were intending to depart for Inglewood, Snowy River, and other new gold fields. If a few properly organised prospecting parties were to go out much good ground would surely be discovered south of the present line of Ballaarat and Bunin3'ong Reefs. In confirmation of this (although not strictly coming within the bounds of my report), I may mention that a paity of ten men has taken possession of a claim situated On the deep alluvial workings very little change has taken place. The only circum stance worthy of particular note is that the Great Britain Company, on the Durham Lead. when driving for the main gutter, discovered a new lead, tributary to the Durham, at a depth of 245 feet, which 1 am informed will yield about 1 oz. per man per week. Affidavit of this discover}' has been duly made, and as soon as the reefs are properly defined I will inspect the same, and in accord ance with the bye-law, commence the registra tion of claims.

The expenditure incurred previous to obtaining any gold, amounted to \u00a334 per share ; so that the net proceeds to each shareholder amounted to only \u00a3275 16s., for the labor of 27 months ; yet this claim had been justly regarded as the best paying on Warren's Lead. The only new feature Brown's Diggings present is the extensive preparations that are making for quartz crushing. On the Victoria Reef, three steam crushing machines are in course of erection ; and another on the Mullochy Point Reef; neither of these are yet completed, but before the current month expires they are all expected to be at work. The alluvial ground at Brown's will take a long time 'yet before it will become re munerative. Several large nuggets have been recently found in the Recompense Claim, Budgeon's Flat ; and farther on the lead the several companies are turning out well, with rich alluvial workings which promise to he of long duration, and numerous quartz reefs of paying quality, so far as they have been tested, Brown's Diggings promise a happy future. Note.\u2014 The above tables relative to machinery are not drawn up in accordance with the instructions. It is not shown what portion is employed in quartz mining and what portion in alluvial mining. At Smythesdale proper there appears to have been a decided improvement during the month: The several claims on the site of the township turning out better than usual and the paying ground appears to extend over a larger area than was hitherto supposed. At the northern end of the district near Darlot's pre-emptive right, a very good prospect has beenobtained; but owing to the great influx of water which has for the last eight months re tarded the progress of the company the des cription of the auriferous ground can hardly be ascertained at present. The prevailing opinion is that they have struck a new gutter which trends in a northerly direction through Mr. Darlot's land, towards Burrumbeet, and will ultimately join the leads proceeding from Ballaarat. Indeed the shallowness of the Roxburgh Castle Lead, flowing threugh the valley of Smythesdale southwards and having its rise near the shaft of this company favors the hypothesis that the new lead trends in a northerly direction, as the shaft is already deeper than the average depth of the Roxburgh Lead. Although these facts are patent I still refuse to endorse the opinion, and am more inclined to believe that the lead has some other course to the southward besides any yet discovered, for should it be found falling to the north, the ancient watersheds would be found to have a trend contrary to the present \u2014 a phenomenon which I have not yet observed in any part of the district. On Warren's Lead the same steady state of affairs which has obtained there for the last two years still prevails without any marked difference. One company, the Great Eastern, have lately dissolved, and I have teen enabled to obtain an abstract of their accounts since the constitution of the company up to its dissolution. Monkey Gully Lead is improving fast. The Havelock Company working a lease there have shared during the past few weeks from \u00a36 to \u00a311 per man per week. The Hong Kong Lead is in high repute, the claims lately bottomed on it show well. On the Black Ball Lead Italian's shares have risen during the month full 50 percent. in consequence of a rich patch struck in the Kossuth Company, and the decided improve ment of the Prince of Wales Claim. Derweot Jack's Gully has been aban doned. At Sawpit Gully, Spring Dallah, a new lead, has been reported ; the quantity of gold got was not much, but it is expected that the place will improve. None of the claims on Spring Dallah Lead have struck gold yet. The Tunnelling party referred to in pre vious reports have extended their tunnel about 400 feet. A section of this I shall send in a few days. At Lucky Woman's a considerable rush has taken place which holds out high hopes. A great proportion of the population of Linton's and other parts of the district are locating themselves there.

This is the best quarter I know of for prospecting, as I believe that it will be the outlet for the leads of the entire district. At Linton's there is a great falling off, except the Standard Lead, which still main tains its high character; no other part of Linton's which has been opened during the late rush has turned out well. There is an evi dent determination on the part of the surplus population there to leave for Snowy River as soon as the weather favors, but I would much prefer them to try what they could do within three miles of their present residence, namely, on the Woady Yallock Plains, and the probabilities would be that they would find themselves ultimately more successful there than they will in that remote quarter upon which their attentions are at present fixed.

I have the honor to annex details of recent At Carngham 'and Snake Valley nothing material has occurred within the month. The several companies there are realizing moderate wages, and nothing more. The Carngham and Britannia Quartz Reefs are taken up by new companies who are busily erecting crushing machinery. mining operations in the Clunes portion of my district. The Port Phillip Company have completed their crushing machinery so far as the uniting their 4 batteries (44 heads), to be worked by the new engine, which has proved adequate to the task. The addition of another 12-head battery is being proceeded with, the foundation for which is already finished. The roof of their extensive build ing is in part being raised, for necessary convenience and ventilation. The yield from the stone crushed by the old companies was very good, but on account of the inefficiency of the machinery opera tions should be suspended. Now that a new and better regime has been established, I have very little doubt of the successful re sult of the Carngham Quartz Reefs. The Chinese miners are busily partaking themselves to the erection of dams and pud dling machines for sluicing and surfacing during the winter months. Quartz crushed from 3rd May to 31st May, 2115 tons; yield, 1185 oz. 6 dwt. Average, 11 dwt. 5 gr. per ton. This is considerably below former yields, but a like poorness has occasionally proved the irregularity in the auriferous nature of the quartz, which, how ever, is shown by the Clunes Quartz Com pany's half-yearly statement to have been 19 dwt. 12| gr. throughout the six months.

(This difficulty is now removed by the erec tion of the dam.) Total quantity of quartz crushed from 20th October, 1859, to 20th April, 1860, 8350 tons (yielding 8.153 oz. 3 dwt. 18 gr.)

During the half year the company have driven 151 J fathoms in cross-cuts besides shaft and other dead work, all which enhances the cost of quartz per ton, according to the estimates given. at the end of the slope now being worked, shows the wall of the main reef changing suddenly from nearly a vertical position and making a floor of quartz at right angles, on which is resting the horizontal bed of slate. This mass of quartz all appears to be payable, and is being raised by a whim by certain con tractors. Robinson's Reef (North).\u2014 The reef in this end is being broken by the ton as in the southern end. A winze has also been sunk on the vein 11 fathoms \u2014 the quartz looking very well. This winze communicates with the cross-cut from the 26 fathom level in the engine shaft. The whole of this reef, 110 fathoms in length and 13 fathoms deep, has been taken out. Engine Shaft is 42 fathoms deep. In this shaft the east vein is cross-cut at 20, 26, 32, and 38 fathoms. The lengths of the drives on this reef iu connection with this shaft ex tend over 520 fathoms. In the lower level, are driving in both ends ; in the 26 fathom level, are driving south, and sloping the ground between it and upper level ; north in the 20 fathom level, driving and stoping south. On the 30 fathom level, a cross cut west 49 fathoms, has intersected Old Man's, Robinson's, and Western Reefs, so that the workings in the 24 fathom level on the Western Reef are free from water. In fact, the whole of the mine to a depth of 38 fathoms is now unwatered. On the 26 fathom level, a cross-cut west intersects the whole of the reefs ; on this level \u2014 are driving north and south on Robinson's Reef, which is here very much broken up and disordered. The engine shaft is 43 fathoms deep, 12 by 5 within, divided with 3-inch timber into double winding and engine shaft. The first 38 fathoms is timbered with 9 by 4 timber, the lower 5 fathoms with 8 by 6. The whole of the work and timbering is of the best de scription; the timber on the plates being framed together with 14-inch square timber, the lower plates being 7 feet 6 inches high, the upper one 6 feet 6 inches in the clear, thus allowing room for sending down large timber. The appearance of the whole work is one of stability. The cost of this shaft has amounted to about \u00a32000. The lowest level is opened at 38 fathoms, and the Eastern Reef cross-cut 7 fathoms from the shaft, width 4 feet, southern end looking well, the northern somewhat disordered. The upper level on this reef is opened at 26 fathoms, which was cut at 4 fathoms from the shaft ; from this level a drive extends nearly the whole length of the Eastern Reef from north to south boundary. The present state of the mine is as sol lo ws : \u2014 Western Reef. \u2014 The shaft is 24 fathoms deep, and timbered from the surface ; the reef is cross-cut at the depth of 22 fathoms, and is opened on the reef for a distance in length over 86 fathoms. In the southern end, stopes about 7 fathoms in depth by 10 fathoms in length, are beaten down. The reef is at times much disordered, but produces average quality of quartz : it is 3 feet wide. In the northern end, the level is being extended ; for a considerable distance this portion of the reef has been over 10 feet wide, but is now contracting. The quartz in this end has been very good, but at present is not remunerative as the run of poor quartz which descends from the surface has been intersected, forming a slide or break in the vein. The workings here extend over 84 fathoms in length by 16 fathoms in depth. Robinson's Reef (South). \u2014The deepest shaft on this reef is 25 fathoms. In sinking a winze near the southern boundary, an extra- ordinary mass of quartz was discovered ; the reef which had previously been worked being about 1 fathom in width, suddenly opening out to nearly 5 fathoms. On sinking a winze at the boundary, water stayed the operation at 4\u00a3 fathoms depth ; here a cross-cut proved the lode to be 5 fathoms wide, but the quartz has suddenly cut out, not continuing to the back of the slope on the 18 fathom level, and entirely disappears at about 3 fathoms from the floor of the 23 fathom level, on which is resting a horizontal floor of slate \u2014 the main body of the reef continuing through the whole depth of the slope.

Victoria Company have driven west 225 feet from the lower level of their shaft, without striking a reef\u2014 passing, however, a mass of broken quartz, which may be the Old Man lode, \u2014 yet, as that has heretofore proved a well-developed reef, and as there is no alteration in the character of the Blue Slate Reef the cross-cut in passing through, the Robinson and Old Man Reefs must have dipped suddenly, or deviated westward very rapidly. I am inclined to think the western most vein worked by the Yankee Company to be the Old Man Reef. The distance from the Eastern Reef (of the cross-cut westward, Victoria Company) is 320 feet. The company intend to continue this drive to the extent of their boundary. Eastern Reef with this company \u2014 At 230 feet level they struck the cap, dipping northwards, having a tendency to incline towards Esmond's Grant. This lode is still comp.iet. 5 feet wide, and promises to yield from 2 to 3 oz. per ton The last test, from 80 tons, gave 108 oz. 5 dwt., but mixed therewith was a quantity of \"mullock.\" The Alliance Company have not resumed mining operations, but intend to put down a new shaft on the morrow. They are crushing at present for the Victoria Company. Alluvial Mining. \u2014 Clunes Company (Tri buters) have commenced to work on former terms, by contract with the Clunes Company. Yield the last month, 371 oz. 4 dwt. 4 gr., value, \u00a31443 3s. 8d. The tribute money (2J per cent.) to the Clunes Company amounted to only \u00a3126 9s. 4d. the last six months. On the Southern Hill the Young Sons of Freedom are obtaining same returns as formerly noted\u2014 from \u00a38 to \u00a312 weekly. This claim promises to be of a permanent character. The Southern Lights have averaged \u00a35 per share weekly; the ground is heavy and dangerous to work aud no timber can be withdrawn ; this company has lately struck a fresh run of gold which promises to pay very well. John Bull Company are sinking a new shaft to work to better advantage, in the meantime they are earning wages. The Lord Nelson Company have let their work by contract; a change of wash-dirt which promises well has been struck in this company's claim, but no definite results have yet been obtained. At Creswick, a good number of miners and others are turning their attention to quartz mining, I have recently surveyed six pros pecting claims for mining of this class. Frenchman's Reef is at present the most promising one; there are on it six parties at work four sinking or prospecting for the reef, one (the Prince of Wales Company) are depth os 37 fathoms by means of a winze from the 26 fathom level. West of this shaft from the same level a cross-cut extends 47 fathoms, which has opened up an immense mass of quartz. At 100 feet from the shaft the first reef was met with, which with the exception of two narrow bars (or horses) of sandstone, is 17J fathoms wide. Westward 2 fathoms, a vein was cut 12 feet wide, and at 6J fathoms further a third vein was struck 5 feet wide, making in this cross-cut, which is 47 fathoms in length, nearly 20J; fathoms of quartz. In cross cut ting the first 10 fathoms no gold was seen, but was visible the rest portion of the large reef Robinson's, the Western, both promise well. It is intended to continue driving on the Western Reef so as to intersect the northern drive from the western shaft, and open up and ventilate the northern portion of the Western Reef. An extent of ground is now opened whereby almost any extent of quartz may be obtained ; present estimate, 66,000 tons. The cross-cut for the Welcome Reef will shortly be com menced. Criterion Company. \u2014 Robinson's Reef with this company has not been pursued in depth to more fully prove it. The rapid deviation in its western underlay has broken off hori zontally at a point 20 feet from the engine shaft It is expected to have resumed its usual course, aud may be found again to the east. At present an unusual flow of water will stny a further search for this lode. From the old workings a winze is being sunk to meet the level of the drives iu the new engine shaft, from which it is contemplated to raise all the quaitz, and save costs of horses and whim. Double winding gear is affixed to this shaft, the tanks to lift water are self filling, and emptied by level power at the sides. The stone looks better in the old workings. The battery is now fitted com plete with iron lifters, which answer to former tests, and are satisfactory. Quartz crushed in tons from 5th May to 2nd June, 550. Yield, 208 oz. 11 dwt. 20 gr.

The Spring Hill Gold Mining Company have got their machinery to work and have about 140 tons of quartz crushed ; they have not yet cleared out the stamp-bed and consequently have not ascertained the yield. The Bald Hill Lead is progressing very favorably and some very good ground is now being worked; one party of nine (the Home ward Bound Company) getting as much as 130 oz. within the week; the claim adjoining the private property has been bottomed at a depth of 145 feet with a prospect of 3 oz. to the load; there is only one party sinking on the private ground, they are now through the second rock. irregular than any other reef on this gold field ; from where the reef is found near the surface to a depth of 70 feet, the dip is east about 6 feet in 1 foot; from 70 to 125 feet, the dip is west, 7 feet in 1 foot ; from 125 feet down, it is again assuming an easterly dip. The thickness at 125 feet deep is 7 feet, and at this depth the gold is of a much heavier quality than at any higher levels ; the quartz contains a large quantity of oxide of iron. Leviathan Reef. \u2014 The company are sink ing a shaft on this reef to a depth of 150 feet before driving for the reef. At 45 feet the reef is found to be 4 feet thick, and contain ing gold of a light scaly character, similar to that found on the Lone Star Reef at a similar depth. The character of the quartz of both reefs is similar. I have not been able to ascertain the result of any of the company's crushings ; they are now making some alter ations in their amalgamating process ; it is the common mercurial mechanical process, consisting of stationary tables, covered with mercurially coated copper plates, with grooves containing mercury in quantity, over which the crushed quartz, &c, passes into circular revolving amalgamators also containing mercury. The same process is used by all the other machines in this gold field, but I consider this piocess very imper fect, as I find, from samples of tailings which I have had chemically assayed from all the machines, that they contain an average of an ounce per ton ; this loss I believe arises from the metallic coating on the gold, which obstructs the amalgamating process; before this can be fully remedied some cheap chemical process is required to remove the obstructive elements before the gold passes into the mercury. The month which commenced very favor ably for sluicing, has not proved to be so, sufficient rain has not yet fallen to make the springs and creeks run freely, only a few of the sluicing companies (and those even par tially) have got to work.

The price of crushing varies from 20s., 21s., to 30s. per ton. Nothing has been done on the Kangaroo Reef this month. I have the honor to forward the monthly report for May. Fisher's Reef \u2014 The original prospectors have again taken up this reef; they are down 120 feet; the reef is 14 inches thick; several small leaders are branching off down at an angle of 45\u00b0 east.

They are now down to a depth of 160 feet, but do not intend driving before going to a depth of 200 feet. At 150 feet they struck a considerable quantity of water, which has since increased as they go deeper ; this will be an advantage to them for a summer supply.

I have not much of importance to com municate to you this month : things are nearly in the same position as when I wrote you last month. The Gibraltar Company have sunk their main shaft an additional 40 feet, and are about to erect more powerful machinery to work this portion of the ground effectively. I have, therefore, judged it necessary to send a drawing containing their extended opera tions. The hopes that the vein north would rise as it first indicated have proved fallacious: it dips steadily north ; however, in No. 5 level they will have about 20 feet more quartz to work out than in the drives above, all work ings in which have now been left. Little Hill Reef. \u2014 This has been taken up by a company on lease, who are busy pre paring dams and site for their machinery. The reef near the surface, at the main shaft, is 60 feet wide, hut reduces in a wedge shape to 140 feet, where it is only 4 feet thick; there are several leaders in the east and west side of the main reef. This is a continuation of the Large Hill Reef, and preserves the same character. The Malakhoff claim, adjoining the Gibraltar, have had their crushing machinery in opera tion for two months, with much more favor able results than previously: they have still a large block of quartz ready for driving out, but have again commenced re-sinking the main shaft, from which, last week, they pro cured some of the best specimens yet obtained from the claim, and the more gratifying, as the gold is more abundant in the crystalline quartz than in the metallic sulphurets. The diagram I have sent, with reference to the dips or zones of auriferous quartz, fully applies to Gibraltar and Malakhoff veins. Alluvial sinking. \u2014 On a gully running west from the top of the mount, and lying on the north-west side of the Large Hill Reef, there are now about 50 miners at work, most of them doing well. The depth of sinking has increased from the top of the gully down from 5 feet to 40 feet ; the forma tion is a loose yellow clay, the wash-dirt is the same, but containing more loose slate, very little quartz ; at the lowest end being worked, the deposit is assuming a more regular lead form, about 8 feet wide, and the wash-dirt from 6 inches to 3 feet thick ; the yield has been as high as 4\u00a3 ounces to the load ; the gold is bright and heavy. The Perseverance Company have delayed operations till some mistakes or oversights are rectified in the formation of the company: they have issued tenders preparatory to com mencing operations. In the Parish of Bungal, on the west side of the East Moorabool River, there are several prospecting parties out, and some pieces of surfacing has been found; the character of the country for some miles is highly auriferous, and promises to form an extensive gold field, it but requires pros pecting. The Albion Company are fixing their pumping apparatus: by next month, their operations may be in such a position that drawings may be made of their works. The Sailor's Reef Company still continue their works on their usually small scale, and with what results I cannot learn: this reef is worked by a company of four men only. Steiglitz Division.

The ac companying drawings will enable the monthly operations to be marked. In the report con nected with the sections of Boxing Reef, sent you lately, the break in the Steiglitz Com pany's ground is noticed, as also that the white vein being found nearer the surface at this point of the reef, that the brown vein found near the surface at the south of this reef, would be found to the west at the north, and at a much greater depth than at the south ; this is inferred from the schistose slate being nearer the surface on the north end, as if the sandstone on the displacement of the strata had slipped on the slate. Old German Reef has been taken up lately again, as also Yankee Reef. The Invincible Company show no present intention of commencing operations on their ground. The Allies Claim adjoining is still un worked. The Union Company on Birmingham Reef have not yet found the vein in their ground (vide plan accompanying Birmingham Reef Plan). Morrison's diggings are comparatively quiet, nothing of any consequence has been found here, although some of the tunnels extend 300 to 400 feet into the hill on the Tea-tree Creek, some very rich patches have been found.

The population is as follows : \u2014 It will be requisite for me to make a special survey of these last named diggings, as they are very much scattered, and until a plan is made it is difficult to form any idea of the probable run of auriferous country. Steiglitz Company's Works. \u2014 I beg to for ward you a report attached to the drawings of the Steglitz Company's Works, as fol lows : \u2014 This company's machinery has been completed and iu operation for some time, the main shaft is now widened and the workings are down to the depth of those left by the original owners ; the vein is, however, about 25 feet to the west of the main shaft, and wrought out to this level ; they have there fore wisely resolved to sink the main shaft till it meets the vein, which by its angle or inclination will not be within less than 50 feet; this will be but a limited and hazardous block for profit, but they have numerous other shafts, none of which will require the expense incurred on the pumping shaft to render them available for working other portions of the ground; an additional inducement to proceed with working simultaneously with the sink ing the main shaft is, their crushing ma chinery is all idle, and as the main shaft is not on the dip of the vein yet they can obtain no quartz for extraction unless from these workings north and south. There are 15 steam engines, of the aggre gate of 156 horse power; 43 puddling ma chines ; 409 sluices and tonis ; and 33 water wheels. Note.\u2014 Mr. Grimes has not prepared the above tables in accordance with the instructions. As a great part of the auriferous lands in this district will pay only by employing the sluicing mode of extracting the gold, a large quantity of water is necessary to the exist ence of these gold fields. At present the supply is comparatively abundant, and in consequence the miners are steadily and pro fitably at work ; at the same time I may mention that the white frosts, that are of nightly occurrence, have a powerful effect in reducing the supply of water. As will be perceived by the number of men employed, quartz mining is at present at a As they are now in a position Strictly to commence mining, I have sent the plan and Europeans. Chinese.

At Myrtleford (on the Ovens River, on the Buckland road, some eighteen miles from Beechworth), where formerly there were some 200 men employed, there are now only about 20, many having left for the splendid quartz reefs at Morse's Creek. In the Nine-mile division the Ovens Water Company are prosecuting their works vigor ously, having nearly got the ditch from \"the tunnel finished, and, as I am informed, entered into a contract to have the whole of the works completed in four months. Every sluice-head of water thus brought into these districts is not the only means of producing a greater yield of gold, but is the surest way of keeping our present population from migra ting to distant gold fields. The present low rate of wages, viz.,\u2014 \u00a33 per week, enables a large extent of ground to be taken up which would not pay in former times. I also notice that a great number of claimholders employ Chinese, one or more being employed in a great number of claims which I visited, they being hired for the purpose chiefly of throw ing out the tailings from the end of the sluices, and from enquiries, I find they are well suited to this work. At Bowman's Forest one claim more has been bottomed on payable ground. There is a general belief that many will shortly be com ing up from the Indigo, and set in in the sorest. The plan which accompanies this report is of Deep Creek, which has had a great deal of labor expended upon it by miners, and a considerable quantity of gold has been extracted therefrom. The ranges adjoining would, in all likelihood pay for sluicing if the water was forthcoming. Snake Valley and Yackandandah Division. The Chinese also are the owners of some very good claims, and do not scruple to pay a long price to Europeans for them, very seldom taking up ground in the first instance, but generally purchasing from European claimholders. (Thomas G. Kennan, Mining Surveyor.) A new era in mining is, I trust, about to dawn on these divisions, viz., that of quartz mining. In the Yackandandah division a prospector's claim has been granted by the warden on a reef situated near Twist's Creek. As yet it would be premature to say anything positive about it, nothing but small leaders having as yet been struck. The quartz from the leaders is what miners would call 4 or 5 oz stone (viz., 4 or 5 oz. of gold to the ton), but the leaders are too narrow (one being only three inches wide) to pay at that. Two parties of two each are putting down shafts, but have not as yet commenced to drive for the reef I will forward a plan connecting the locality of the reef with the main creek with my next month's report. If this reef be found payable it is sure to give a great impetus to prospecting in these divisions, as numbers of reefs are known, and can be seen cropping out, but with one exception have never yet been prospected. I herewith forward a plan of a portion of the Yackandandah Creek, known as Kirby's Flat. This flat has been worked and re- worked, and, as will be seen by the plan, a number of parties are at present engaged working there. As to the quality of the wash-dirt I am unable to give any informa tion, except that the parties seem well satis- fied with their earnings \u2014 miners in general having a most unconquerable dislike to state how they are doing, or what the yield of gold in their claim may be. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 Alluvial Mining:\u2014 Fuddling mills ... 5 A considerable fall of rain took place during the past month, which has had the effect of causing increased activity in minino operations in the above divisions. Miners, however, still complain, more particularly in the Nine-mile division, of the supply not as yet being up to the general average at this time of year. In the Yaokandandah division we have had a considerable increase in our supply owing to a large body, viz. :\u2014 Four full sluice heads being made available by the Pioneer Company, and they can supply 10 heads more when called on. This will no doubt be taken up as soon as claim holders will have had time to cut races from the company's reser voir. The company are exceedingly moderate in their charges, viz., \u2014 \u00a33 per week for a full sluice-head of 36 inches for twelve hours. The full benefit of this supply cannot be properly appreciated until the dry season sets in. when if they can supply the same amount of water, the benefit to the district will be sensibly felt.

The miners experience much difficulty in finding the lead, and the wash dirt is much diffused, and, consequently, poor. (Thomas E. Thornely, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 For the reasons adduced in first paragraph, I have nothing new to report of the junctions of the Devonshire, Caledonian, and Durham Leads, except that in the case of the latter an impression now prevails that the lead takes a sharp turn under Christmas Town, and consequently a prospecting shaft is now being sunk to the westward of the old sup posed course of the lead, in the direction of the Victoria. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Victoria Lead has not turned out so well as was anticipated ; but the lower part, after having been abandoned, is now being re-worked, from an idea that it will prove a continuation of the Durham, and that the upper part is only a feeder to the last-named lead. The Kincardineshire, though a long and remunerative lead, is nearly worked out by Europeans, and is for a great part of its length occupied by Chinese, to whom the claims have been sold. In the gulch at the bead of this lead, shown on the accompanying tracing, and which is about 20 feet deep, a few shafts have been sunk, which have struck payable gold at a depth of about 14 feet. It is probable that this lead springs from the Mount Hope Reef, which is about 30 chains distant from it, as you will perceive by referring to plan No. 3. A new lead, called the Adelaide, was pro claimed on the 14th ultimo. The prospect shaft is 115 feet in depth, and the prospect was only J dwt. to the nailcan, or 15 dwt. to the cart load. The wash-dirt in this claim was 12 inches in depth, and the width as yet undefined. The second prospect shaft averaged 22 dwt. to the cart-load, at 105 feet siuking, and about 15 inches of wash-dirt. Four or five other shafts have struck the gold, but the supposition is that it will not prove a rich lead, though in patches it will pay well. It is supposed it will make a junction with the old Indigo Lead at about 50 chains above Newtown, where a break in the lead will be observed in my plan of the Indigo Main Lead. The great depths which the sinkings have reached on the lower parts of the deep leads, in some instances over 230 feet, and the time necessarily occupied in sinking, draining, and opening out the drives in wet claims, tend to make my monthly report very bare of incident, in regard to those portions of the diggings. A very large proportion of the diggers of this district are occupied on those heavy claims, and long periods elapse before any results can be reported ; hence the brief notices in some of my recent reports. The Chiltern Lead is being steadily worked, but the heavy expenses incurred in the wet claims will prevent the shareholders for some time to come realizing their original expec tations.

The upper parts of all the older leads are still partially worked by Chinese. slightly intermixed with quartz, and having occasional layers of cemented ironstone. In some places there are also in this formation enormous boulders of the blue stone rocks, some weighing many tons. This drift is from three to fifty feet in depth, and is covered by red loam to a depth of from one to fifteen feet, and in the swampy ground by lighter colored loam and beds of clay. Some portions of this drift are very hard and difficult to work, and others of such a loose nature as scarcely to require the use of a pick. The gold is sometimes found from the surface downwards, even in the deepest ground, but more frequently from the bed-rock, to from one to five feet in the gravel, sometimes in the various layers of gravel where there is a change in the hard ness of the stone composing it, with little through the bulk of the drift, and sometimes chiefly on the bed-rock itself, and to a con siderable depth in the slaty veins in the softer portions. The Sebastopol Lead, on the middle part, is yielding moderate wages and no more. Quartz.\u2014 The machinery on the Magenta Reef has been completed and set to work on stone raised from the claim. I have not heard the result. A quartz leader at the back of Cornish Town has been worked for some months, and the average yield of the quartz has been over 7 ounces to the ton. I believe that an ener getic and systematic prospecting for quartz reefs in this district would ultimately prove highly remunerative. Gitchell and Chalmers' is the only machine working for hire, but the quantity of stone raised does not find it employment for more than two and three days in a week. The proprietors report one crushing to have been over 7 ounces to the ton, and the general average to be about 2 ounces to the ton. The cost of crushing is 20s. for the poorer stone up to 30s. for the richer sorts, varied also according to quantity. There are many channels through the flats considerably deeper than the present river bed, and the ground has generally been richest on the sloping reefs of these channels and in the more shallow ground, with but little gold in the pockets of the rock and deep gutters. The driest parts of the narrow flats between the river and the ranges have, on the upper part of the Buckland, been sunk upon and driven out, and these, with the banks of the river and creeks, are now generally only remunerative for sluicing on the hydraulic principle with large boxes and a heavy head of water ; by these means, if the ground is tolerably accessible, good wages are frequently made by re-working snch ground as has been abandoned as worthless ; to work under any other system, frequently however, very expensive tail races have to be cut to work and draw the ground ; thus a great outlay is necessary before any profit can be realized, and this, with the cost of a head of water (\u00a34 per week), con sumes almost all the returns from the poorer ground. Bockland Division. (R. H. Stone, Mining Surveyor.) I have the honor to forward to the Board of Science my first monthly report of the Buckland division of the Beechworth Mining District. The division comprises the Buckland and Ovens rivers to the junction of the two, together with their tributaries of Cleve's Creek and the Devil's Creek on the Buck land, and Morse's and Growler's Creeks on the Ovens. In the Buckland portion of my division mining operations consist principally of sluicing in the bed and banks of the river and creeks, and on the adjoining flats. The head of water usually employed is 40 inches with a pressure of 5 inches above the centre of the aperture of the gauge ; some ground requires twice that quantity. The usual pressure of the hydraulic is 60 feet, and, with that fall, is considered equal to the labor of from 10 to 15 men. The supply of water is obtained at a sufficient elevation, by a system of races on either side of the river which head from the highest portions of the stream. The general formation of the auriferous ground is \u2014 1st. a very uneven bed-rock principally consisting of soft yellow sandstone with veins of slate intermixed, and occasional bars of hard bluestODe running nearly parallel to the river. 2nd. the auriferous drift consists of heavy water-worn gravel and sandstone boulders The hydraulic is most suitable for deep ground, from 20 to 50 feet, the shallower"], [293, "MINING SUBYEYOES' BEPOETS \u2014 MAY. 111 ground is worked by the usual plan of ground sluicing. There are also a few driving claims still being worked, which are drained by similar tail races to the sluicing claims or by tunnels. and a tunnel was driven with the object of working the reef, it was however commenced too low and the party were flooded out and abandoned the ground without having struck the reef. It is now again taken up by a party who state that they will give it a thorough trial. The bed of the river and the lower banks are paddocked and the washing stuff raised by stages to the sluice ; these claims are drained by water-wheels and Californian and elevator pumps. The upper part of the river bed has been already once worked, but although it is well known that many patches have been left through a slovenly system of working, it is doubtful if they can be profitably re-worked, owing to the great accumlation of tailings from the bank claims. At the present time the most important and flourishing part of my district is the Ovens River and Morse's and Growler's Creeks, where within the last eight months no less than twenty-nine auriferous quartz reefs and veins have been discovered, most of them of great apparent richness, but as yet quartz has been crushed from only five of this num ber with the satisfactory results given in another part of this report. The lower part of the Buckland has been but very imperfectly tested owing to the heavy quantity of water and the flatness of the country which does not admit of sufficient fall for tailings to work ground sluices ; some good patches are occasionally found which pay for paddocking, but the expense attending the use of pumps and wheels deters the greater number of the miners from prospecting the wet ground. With greater capital and more effective machinery I believe a large area of ground adjoining the river on the Lower Buck land would prove payable, but as there has never been any continuous lead in the dis trict the risk is greater in employing these increased means. The alluvial workings on the Ovens River and its tributaries have as yet, generally proved to be comparatively poor, although some few patches paid good wages for a time. The general formation is similar to that of the Buckland, but the flats are much more extensive, and the drift contains great quanti ties of quartz boulders, frequently containing gold: and most of the alluvial gold in this locality is so highly impregnated with quartz as to require pounding and cleaning previous to selling it. The population of the whole Buckland division may be said to be settled, as regards the usual residents; but so many are daily arriving from all parts of the country, at tracted by the reports of the reefs, and others, unable to obtain immediate employment leaving, that it is at present impossible to give a correct report of the number in the district. There are two quartz reefs at the head of the left hand fork of the river which were opened in 1858 with good prospects, some stone from the cap of one reef (the Alta) having yielded 13 oz. to the ton. The aver age has, however, been only only 1 oz, 5 dwt. per ton on the Alta, and 10 dwt. on the Nelson Reef; and these yields have not proved remunerative for crushing by steam power. The approximate number of resident miners is as follows : \u2014 The Alta Reef from which the best quartz has been raised, has been temporarily aban doned in consequence of water having been struck; the vein is at present only about ten inches thick. The company who are occupiers of these reefs, are still working the Nelson from which they have lately had better quartz, and they contemplate erecting a water wheel to work their machinery in lieu of the steam engine ; water power is available for about seven months in the year in abundance for their purpose. Another reef on the main river was dis covered soon after the Alta and Nelson under 8orne alluvial workings close to, and about fifty feet above the level of the river ; some fine specimens were obtained from the stone Locality. | a. c a w _ 5 Remakes.

This portion of the line is raised on piles to give a view to the breaksman of the whole line. I have the honor to submit the following information respecting those quartz claims from which stone has been crushed, or which appear to be the most promising. Hitherto all the quartz has been raised to the surface, and the greater part of the mullock of the reef; there are however, four galleries which are partly stowed, and the position of which will be seen in another part of the plan. This reef has only been struck iu the one claim, and no work worthy of notice has been done by any other party. The Pioneer and Cockney's Reefs are situated on the western side of Morse's Creek, on a spur of the great dividing ranges between that and the Buckland, and have been par tially worked, the former by Messrs. Rossiter and Co., of Myrtle Creek, quartz miners, and the latter by Messrs. Cotsworth. This latter was about a foot wide, and for a while, I am informed, averaged 3 oz. per ton; when it became poorer it was abandoned. The quartz has usually been stacked in a paddock, marked F, and taken down to the mill at the convenience of the company. The site of the mill and kilns, and remainder of the tramway will appear iu a continuance of No. 1 plan. On the Pioneer Reef Messrs. Rossiter sunk an underlay shaft, opening the ground for a short distance at intervals, and raising the quartz from a small vein under the reef, and which on being crushed yielded from 3 to 4 oz. per ton; the reef itself was considered too poor to work, only paying about 10 dwt. per ton; it is, however, close to an abundant supply of water power, and I have no doubt, that with good management might be made to pay well ; the thickness is 4 feet on an average. After sinking 130 feet on the reef the small vein ran out, and in 3 feet further another joined the reef, a ton of which yielded 13 oz. 12 dwt., but there was, however, so little stone payable that the claim was abandoned. 'It has since been taken up by two other parties, who are driving in tunnels at a low level, in expecta tion of striking a good reef in the bill. The following is a list of the reefs which have been discovered and named in the Buckland division, up to the date of this report : \u2014 The casing of this reef contains considerable quantities of gold. A quantity on being crushed paid 1 oz. per ton, and a prospect of 16 oz. was taken from one bucket from the cap of the reef. There is also another vein in the front of one of tunnels, the casing of which yields good prospects, but no gold can be seen in the quartz. This vein is two feet in thickness. The greatest quantity of quartz has been raised from the Oriental Reef, which is situate nearly on the top of the dividing range, be tween Morse's and Growler's Creeks and the Ovens River. Messrs. Butler and Co., the prospectors, have raised 800 tons, which after paying \u00a32 10s. for crushing, and about 15s. for cartage, has paid them handsomely ; but I have not been able to learn the yield per ton from this claim. Messrs. Rossiter and Co., No. 1 North, has crushed 824 tons, which has, I am informed, averaged 4 oz., and the reef is still improving. No. 1 South (Cotsworth and Co.) have crushed 120 tons, the yield of which was loz. 10 dwt. Note.\u2014 The names marked thus * are the only ones from which quartz has been crushed.

In all these claims the reef averages 6 feet in thickness. of it appear literally smothered in fine gold, and the quartz is all of that dark rusty ap pearance which hides a considerable quantity. Messrs. Richardson have sunk two shafts on their claim, at a considerable distance apart, one about 70 feet, and the other 80 feet, in depth, and some of the best looking stone has been raised from the bottom of these shafts. The Poor Man's Reef has yielded some very rich specimens of coarse gold, one of which weighing 11 oz., on being crushed turned out 8 oz of gold ; these specimens were from the cap of the reef, which is not yet payable in appearance ; another patch of specimens was struck at 40 feet, and the prospectors are still sinking. The Woolshed, Ebenezer, and Falkner's Reefs, show very rich quartz on the surface, but the shafts are cut so short a dis tance down that it is impossible to report certainty respecting them. I am informed that the Rose of Australia is likely to eclipse anything yet discovered, so rich are the spe cimens, but I have not yet been able to visit the reef; it is situate about 20 miles higher up the Ovens River than the Oriental Reef.

This reef is from 3 feet to 1 foot in thickness. Nos. 1 and 2 North are driving tunnels for the reef. Swipers' Reef. \u2014 The only claim on this reef has had a few tons crushed from the sur face stone, which gave the unsatisfactory result of only 8 dwt., and it is very barren looking quartz ; the prospectors are, however, still persevering in hopes of its improvement. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 No quartz has been crushed as yet from any other reef, but. in one or two instances large quantities are awaiting the formation of roads and erection of more crushing power.

There are very few new mills being erected at present, owing to a deal of good ground having been shut up by leases, but many of these are now being withdrawn, which will give facility to those who choose to take advantage of it for puddling purposes. A few public puddling companies have gone to work with very satisfactory results. The Back Creek Company have a most perfect arrangement in machinery ; a splendid 30 horse-power horozontal engine, with an ample boiler; two patent revolving cylinders, with a patent cylindrical amalgamator, at tached to which is a long ripple sluice, empty ing into a box, partially filled with mercury, which is kept agitated, and which is the last process, thereby saving every particle of gold. Several trials were made from various parts of their groumd (about forty acres), and the results were such as to give them every hope. some other new claims on the various lines of reef are becoming remunerative and turning out quartz more or less auriferous. Stafford Reef. \u2014 Two claims on this line have got gold since my last report \u2014 one to the north and opposite Diamond Hill have struck a fine body of quartz which will yield, it is expected, about 5 oz. per ton. The claim to the south of this have also got very pay able quartz. The German's claim, Herne and Co., are still getting payable stone ; they have sunk a new shaft on the same body of stone from which they are now crushing about 15 dwt. per ton. Silverlock and Company's claim farther to the south have got the reef and they have had several crushings ; the stone now yields about lj oz. per ton. Other claims are sinking for the reef which crops out at the surface, but it only yields gold at various irregular depths ; none of these have yet found payable stone, but they are very san guine about it. Glasgow Reef. \u2014 This line still looks very dull, very few claims in proportion to the many are working, and these are sinking to the water level, -near the supposed main line, to be in readiness for the pumping engine. The Bendigo Puddliug Association have at last made a start ; the results of their wash ings are not yet known, but the ground is well known to be very rich. Fagg and Company are still getting good payable stone. Ness and Company have ceased working for the present, having worked out their payable stone, which was a hori zontal spur embedded in a soft blue slate, about eight inches thick and very rich. The claims to the north of this have the same body, five feet thick, but not so rich, however they are crushing it and it pays them very well. The North British Company have also commenced ; they are washing on the prin ciple of the old horse puddling-machine, which is better adapted for breaking up the clay, thereby saving gold which would other wise be lost. The Bendigo Valley have not yet commenced operations, but are in active preparation for it; they have a large quantity of ground which is also very deep. 1 am told by those who have wrought on the spot that there are two bottoms, or two deposits of gold in the alluvium ; the first one, at a depth of eight feet, was not discovered in the early times, but was turned over along with the mass of head ings, and became lost, in a remunerative sense, to the tub and cradle men ; the second bottom was found to be very rich, especially near the old creek, but too wet to work it effectually ; the company have a splendid dam cut down to the sandstone bed, which will effectually drain the ground and yield them a constant supply of water. The Golden Gully Company are getting some tolerably good stone from the Wes tern Reef, they are also crushing for the public, and have reduced the price to 16s. per ton. The Diamond Hill Company are getting very good stone just below water level ; they have just purchased Schilling's claim to the north, which joins their workings, which gives them 270 yards of reef with a beauti ful eight horse engine in good order, and kept constantly at work. The accompanying plan of the hill will show the entire workings. The whole of the stone excavated has b'een crushed, and the poorest of it gave a slight dividend, but the most of it was very rich. The ground has all been shored with timber and then stowed End wedged in with clean solid stone, making the ground perfectly solid. In their east cross-cut they found a small body of stone underlying to the east, which makes me believe it is the eastern limb The Water Works Company have ceased to wash at Golden Square, as also have the Kangaroo Flat Company, Grove, &c.

The company have two engines, one for crushing which is erected and at work, having four batteries of stamps of four in each frame, capable of crushing 30 tons per diem. The stone is easily got being on the surface. In such instances comparatively poor stone will pay, as the expense in getting it is so trifling. The stone that is now being crushed is handsomely remunerative. Sheepshead Reef. \u2014 This line is looking up. The Union Company's Northern Claim is now yielding some excellent stone from the top reef, and the company crushed up wards of 200 ounces last week mostly from this claim. Hooper and Co's. claim to the north, has found the same run of gold and they are getting up the stone for crushing which is expected to yield handsomely. I saw some very rich specimens from the first lot of stone. Thompson and Co's, to the north, are getting stone but not of so good a quality, but still remunerative. Three leases intervene betwixt this and Bendigo Flat, where several claims have been taken up, two of which crushed 5 ounces from a small spur on the back of the reef. The water is so troublesome here that very little can be done in the shape of taking up quartz. The other engine is for pumping. The engine shaft is already sunk, and preparations are making to get it under weigh. The two machines will stand together in one house, which is a large substantial stone building with strong corrugated iron roof, with a span of 45 feet aud very lofty. LeCapelain is very persevering and enterprising and will spare no means to make this one of the first companies on Bendigo. The other company has -1 claims, in all 200 yards of the best part of the reef at present known. There are 60 shares of \u00a3100 each, and preparations are being made for the erection of the machinery; meantime nothing is being done in the mines. Paddy's Gully Reef. \u2014 This line is im proving, principally to the south,' and Watson's claim is yielding 1J oz. per ton. Smith and Co., are getting up stone, but of rather an inferior quality ; they need to go deeper, and are anxiously waiting for the pumping company to cut the reef in their claim, when there is little doubt but that the whole line will be effectually drained ; meantime most of the claims are remaining idle. Specimen Hill, Long Gully, Newchum, Victoria, Sparrow Hawk, Garden Gully, Hustlers, Windmill Hill, and the Perseverance Reefs fall into my division, the workings of which I am not very conversant with, but hope to be able to report upon them in my next. Specimen Hill, Tin Pot Reef. \u2014 The com pany have commenced to crush ; they have had one 'washing up, the result of which is stated to have surpassed expectations. The reef as they go down is becoming thicker and no doubt will break out into a good solid body. The German Amalgamated Claim, to the north, are constantly taking out stone which averages one ounce per ton, and other claims to the north are working with similar results. The Blue Lend is with few excep tions lying dormant. This has been a good lead and very rich stone has been taken therefrom. Eaglehawk Division. (G. W. Hart, Mining Surveyor.) I have the honor of submitting to the Board of Science my report for the month of May, 1860. Within the past month a slight increase has taken place in the number of puddling mills that have recommenced working, but only one new one has been added to the former list. The Chinese population has much increased in my division, and they may be seen working in many places with great activity ; indeed they are now nearly the only persons employing the tub and cradle, the greater part of the miners of that class having removed to other localities. In quartz mining there is about the usual amount of work done, and no doubt but that many of them are very remunerative, but I cannot take upon myself to state to what extent, as I have no means of ascertaining the true yield of gold. Thistle Reef. \u2014 Little is being done on this line at present. A few claims are sinking to water level and one or two of the southern claims are getting gold varying from 1 to 2J oz. per ton. O'Donnel's claim had ceased working a little while having lost the run of the gold, but they have resumed work again, and intend following down the quartz to water, providing they do not previously find gold.

A plentiful supply of water is contained in two large reservoirs formed in the bed of the creek. This company commenced to work about a month since, but it is not yet known with what success. MARYBOROUGH MINING DISTRICT. Maryborough Division. * Crushing for owners. Another reaction to Gibraltar has been the (D. O. Leary, Mining Surveyor.) means of increasing the European population, and though sufficient has not transpired to warrant a belief in the success of this little The population is as follows rush, yet there are strong indications in its favor. Two years ago a large rush was on the same ground, which is situate on the east side of McCallum's Creek, and nearly due north 60 chains from the north end of the McCallum's Creek old lead, celebrated for its coarse gold and large nuggets. In the rest of the division nothing fresh has occurred. With respect to the remaining portion of the Maryborough Main Lead, shown in the accompanying tracing, the alternate strata, as far as the First White Hill, are nearly similar to those already mentioned, but in proportion as the lead extends in the direction of Have lock it gets deeper. There is also a wide gutter which has been occasionally discovered, varying in width from 12 jto 30 feet, which the diggers pronounce no good. The sinking on the gutter is about 60 feet, and the wash dirt on the reefs on either side of this gutter has paid better \u2014 several patches on the reefs turned out 12 oz. per load, while the verage yield might be considered 1 oz. per load. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The First White Hill, though shallow sink ing, from 6 to 12 feet, paid very well, and the Second White Hill, still shallower, from 4 to 10 feet deep, paid much better, and it appears is now offering sufficient inducement to some Chinese who have been re-working it. * Three additional quartz crushers just erected are included, which will commence operations forthwith.

Two alluvial rushes took place about the end of the month, one at old Dunohy and one at Burnt Creek, but, notwithstanding the prospects were good, I regret to report, they have as yet been failures. The alluvial gold procured during the month is chiefly from old ground, Jones's Creek having yielded largely. Several parties there have got a great amount in nuggets ; but, as yet, nearly all the alluvial work done in the division is by tub and cradle, and horse pud dling machines. At the top of the gully the sinking is 20 feet thick\u2014 bottom hard sandstone. Havelock Flat, Wet Lead. \u2014 The dullness which has so long prevailed here is certainly attributable to the strong under current of water, which could not be overcome without the aid of machinery \u2014 to accomplish which strong efforts are about being made by a few local enterprising miners, who still retain no small share of confidence in this portion of the old lead. In reefing there is little alteration to record. The usual success continues at Sandy Creek, which is the principal place in in the district for that branch. Three of the reefs here have much improved, viz., Iron Bark, which was nearly deserted, only paying \u00a3 oz. to the ton, is yielding 3 oz. in two claims, at 100 feet deep, and the reef over 6 feet thick. \u2014 The Great Western, a continu ation of which northward has been struck, and the stone raised looks rich, \u2014 and the Maiden Reef.

The machinery is as follows Jericho. \u2014 Here several of the quartz claims formerly abandoned, are being prospected again. The German Reef is the only one from which payable quartz is being obtained, and nothing rich has ever been obtained on it, but the quartz is generally easily got out, and averages about 1 oz. per ton.

Korong. \u2014 Mining operations have not at tained so lively an appearance since the late rains, as might have been anticipated con sidering the large tracts of auriferous ground yet unopened in the neighborhood. A few of the miners here are prospecting in the scrub, and meet at times with payable ground, but the majority remain working in, and adjoining the old ground, so that those prospecting are quite insufficient (in number) for the develop ment of gold, where it is so irregularly dis tributed. Inglewood. \u2014 This is still the chief centre of population within this district. The number of miners has decreased gradually during the month ; the majority of claims on the deep ground being nearly worked out. The deep lead at New Inglewood is pro gressing slowly, and has now exceeded 100 feet in depth, with water, and if followed much farther, the water may be expected to prove troublesome. The lead lately has been very narrow, and getting considerably poorer, so that very little encouragement is in view for the individual miner to cause him to follow it much farther. The deep lead at Old Inglewood is progressing with very fa vorable results ; it has now attained a great length and depth, but the sinking is easier than formerly, and there is every indication of it continuing payable for a considerable distance. The shallow portions of the dig gings opened lately have soon been worked out, or temporarily abandoned by the majority. Several parcels of cement from the deep lead, New Inglewood, have been crushed at Sandy Creek (Tarnagnlla) during the month, yield ing from 3 to 10 oz. per ton ; some few lots have also been crushed at the machine lately erected on the Loddon. Some claims at the Surface Hill are expected to yield at the rate of 2 oz. per ton to the depth of 3 or 4 feet. The cement in the deep ground is found over lying the bed-rock, averaging from 2 to 8 inches in thickness, at depths varying from 25 to 80 feet. The crushing machines, and quartz mining are temporarily stopped, pending the settle ment of disputes in the Court of Mines. The puddling machines are for the most part actively employed and generally yielding favorable results. Kingower. \u2014 The majority of the alluvial miners have been more fortunate than usual, several small patches of remunerative surfac ing, and shallow ground having been opened adjoining the old workings, but nothing worthy of causing a rush has been discovered. Quartz mining is still receiving a fair amount of labor and capital from the few inhabitants. On the Union Reef, but veiy little quartz has been raised for some time, the claimholders being with few exceptions engaged in sinking for a second lode. The Amalgamated Com pany on this reef have sold their interest therein, and the new owners have made ap plication for a lease of the ground. The depth attained in the claim is 216 feet. The pro spectors of the Bonaccord Reef are still ob taining gold, but not iu paying quantities. A prospecting party are engaged on a reef, from which gold was obtained several years ago, situate about half a mile south from the Union Reef. Quartz mining has attracted a great many speculators and others, and prospecting is carried on largely, in many localities to an unreasonable extent, although in many At work. Idle.

Except in few instances, the main reefs or lodes cannot he found without working or following veins from thepoint of discovery, which occupies a considerable time. Quartz mining here will be an extensive and permanent business on this field, and is progressing as fast as can be expected. Great caution and apathy have been shown previous to the introduction of machinery by capitalists. the reefers on the Barfold and Green Ranges, Taradale, are Forest Creek inhabitants, not returnable by me. It will be seen that the puddling machines are decreasing, and also alluvial gold mining companies ; but steam power, as applied to quartz crushing, is increasing, and the splen did machinery now being erected by our quartz companies will bear comparison with any in the colony. The Eureka Quartz Mining Company. \u2014 The new machinery of this company is work ing admirably, the engine is a condenser, by Barratt and Company, of 35 horse-power ; the crushing apparatus, 24 head of stamps and gear are very complete, and the whole plant creditable to the manager and company. The smaller engine formerly used for crushing is removed to the hill, there to be employed in draining the reef and raising the quartz; when completed, a considerable saving will be effected in manual labor, and consequent working expenses. The company have ap plied for an additional lease of the Northern, or Old Eureka, which it is proposed to work by driving an adit on level of machinery, which is unquestionably the best system wherever practicable. CASTLEMAINE MINING DISTRICT. Castlemaine Division. (Thomas L. Brown, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Old Quartz Hill Company have pur chased, and are now busily erecting, a fine engine of 50 horse-power. At starting, only 24 head of stamps will be used, but the gear is adapted for increasing that number. In a previous report I gave a detailed account of Old Quartz Hill Reef, which report is fully proved by an adit just completed by the company, which is driven on a level with the passes into which the quartz will be tipped for stamping. The tunnel \u2014 a good piece of workmanship \u2014 is 281 feet long, the first portion principally through sandstone. At 100 feet from the entrance a quartz lode of 10 feet thickness was met with, and from this lode to the old workings the country is inter sected with slate bands and innumerable veins and leads of ferruginous quartz. At 220 feet an immense lode is penetrated which continues unbroken 61 feet in thickness to the former shafts ; these lodes are unprospected except by the contractors, who find gold throughout.

Mining operations throughout the Castle maine division bavo improved during the past month, a plentiful supply of water ena bles the puddlers to work with vigor, and the table of returns from quartz reefs show very payable results. The Old Specimen Gully, Gold Mining Association. \u2014 The prospects of this company are more encouraging, the working expenses have beenjconsiderably diminished,the usually tedious and costly operations of opening the mine have been perseveringly prosecuted through a hard blue stone country ; the main tunnel being now 500 feet long connecting nearly all the original claims and shafts, and several material alterations have been effected In compliance with late instructions, I have again taken a careful census of the mining population, defining their locale and occupa tion. These tables include only those miners bond fide at work at the time of my visit, and will show a falling off in population, great numbers being temporarily employed on the railway, getting road metal, &c, and most of Europeans.

A trial of 6 tons from this adit yielded 1 oz. per ton, and 464 tons crushed from the reef gave an average yield of 7 dwt. 18J gr. per ton ; as this yield is sufficient to cover working expenses, no doubt can be entertained of the ultimate success of the company so soon as the mine is opened and the splended machinery kept constantly employed. RETURNS FROM QUARTZ REEFS, The Bolivia Reef Company's machinery consists of 35 horse-power engine now driving a battery of 16 heavy revolving stamps, which is kept pretty constantly employed, crushing from 200 to 250 tons per week ; the yield from which is 4 to 5 dwts. per ton. The main adit 8 feet wide by 7 J high is completed, and is 230 feet long. It is driven through the lode, which is 17 feet wide with slate foot wall, and sandstone head wall, the im mense body of quartz showing indications of gold. It is proposed to add other 8 stamps, as the quantity of stone and facility for ob taining it, will render a small yield pay able, with every probability of finding rich patches. The Cumberland Reef Company. \u2014 The Cumberland Reef Company are erecting an engine of 30 horse-power with a battery of 12 heavy stamps.

It is intended to sink the pump shaft 200 feet, by which the reef dips northerly at the rate of one in three, and underlays westerly at the same declination, and is from 6 to 10 feet wide ; but the richest known quartz is at present submerged in water. Hepburn Division. (Ambrose Johnson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Capper's Reef Company have arranged their differences with the contractors for machinery, and their plant consisting of a 20 horse-power engine and 8 revolving stamps, is now reducing their piled quartz, a trial from which yielded above 1 oz. per ton. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Amalgamating process. \u2014 The apparatus now most generally adopted is known as the Improved Clunes principle, the tailings passing alternately over broad copper plates and through troughs of mercury ; the loss of sine gold being further prevented by inclined planes covered with green baize. At the Eureka Company the process of amalgamation is facilitated by the waste water from the condenser which affords a constant stream over the ripples, heated to about 120 degrees. In addition to the above, one steam crush ing machine is in course of erection.

Mining affairs in general are, however, in a flourishing con dition, the water supply, with a few excep tions, being fully sufficient for sluicing and puddling purposes. parently being a regular thing in the claims where gold has been struck. Perseverance Reef, Sailor's Creek, is at a standstill during the wet season, the owners being busy crushing the quartz raised during the summer.and I understand that the produce proves fully satisfactory. In quartz workings 1 beg to report the dis covery of anew reef \u2014 Hamburgh Reef, situate in Forty Foot, Yandoit. The width of reef appears to be 10 or 12 feet, and a few tons of the top quartz, crushed on trial from the pro specting claim, yielded upwards of 2 oz. per ton, taking about a couple of feet of the reef. When I last visited the ground a few shafts were sinking, but owing to the sudden strike the prospectors were the only party getting payable gold. On Doctor's Reef, Doctor's Gully, Mr. Needham has bought the whole of the mine, plant, &c, and to judge by the way the work is carried on, the reef appears to be very payable. In Yandoit reefing seems to be very quiet, 3 tons from the prospecting claim. Pioneer Reef yielded about 80 oz. per ton, but I have not heard of any other crushing of remark able richness. The sudden dip of the gold requires a considerable outlay of capital and labor in most claims where gold is not ob tained from the surface, and as three months' labor entitles parties, if out of funds, to three months registration, they generally avail themselves of the opportunity, if during such period no payable gold has been obtained. I trust, however, that gradually a better system of prospecting will be introduced, and doubt not that our reefs, if worked with the necessary skill and energy, will be found equal to those on other gold fields. From the old. reefs no remarkable crush ings have taken place, 1 oz. to 1 J oz. per ton being the average, and on most of them only one or two claims are being worked. On Parker's Specimen Reef, head of Dry Diggings, five of the old claims having been worked down to the water level, have lately amalgamated with a view of procuring ma chinery, and I doubt not that the introduction of system on this reef will lead to the most satisfactory results. On Beehive Reef, I am informed, the quartz is looking as well as ever, but 1 have not heard of any crushing during the month of May ; the last crushing from the prospecting claim, the only claim working, yielded over 11 oz. per ton. Puddling and Sluicing. \u2014 Most parties en gaged puddling and sluicing have, during the month, been in full activity, and I believe averaging about wages. Hired labor appears this season not to be employed to the same extent as the preceding ones, but want of confidence in the duration of wet weather may be perhaps as much the reason as po verty of the ground. Besides this, only very little new ground has been taken up for the above purposes this season, a number of claims from last winter not being worked out, and the chance of getting water for more than a couple of months in any new race being very limited. On Sportsman's Reef the whole of the claims are at present registered, payable gold having only been obtained in two claims, and not lasting in either. On Wombat Reef the Cornish party is still getting payable stone, now and again coming across good patches. The company employs 16 men, and work in a manner enabling them to crush quartz that under ordinary circum stances would be considered valueless. From Messrs. Addis and Co.'s claims I have heard nothing lately. Tunnelling. \u2014 In this branch of mining no visible change has taken place, no new ground having been discovered. In most tunnel claims the parties are at present en gaged washing up the large heaps of stuff piled during the summer, and with the fa cility now offered by Mr. Wilson's race from Wollowbee Creek coming across the elevated plains, even very poor stuff yields a remu neration for washing. OnCollier's Reef, Wombat, Messrs. Winther and Co , owing to dissolution of partnership, have for some time suspended operations, and the rest of claims have long ago been de serted. Gray's Reef is registered for excess of water, and Melvin's Beef. Todd's Reef, and Emerald Reef are only being worked by one party each, average 1 to lj oz. per ton. In alluvial sinking things are getting re markably dull, according as Wbitehead's Lead, Kidd's Gully is becoming exhausted.

Melvin's Reef, (B Plan VIII.) near the head of Blind Creek. The discoverers, puddling the surface came upon some rich but narrow leaders ; but the distance from crushing ma chinery and perhaps want of faith or ex perience in quartz working, caused them to dispose of the claim for \u00a3150, after working out said leaders, and finding a solid body of quartz, containing a little gold all through. The purchasers have since opened out the reef, and the average yield has been 1 and 1$ oz. per ton. The mining population has during the month been gradually diminishing, and to judge by the general feeling among the miners, an immigration en masse to the Snowy River will take place early in the spring. probably ending in the disappointment of many, and Jim Crow, poor as it is called, will then in many persons estimation be the most likely place to afford a fresh start. These last two dry seasons, when the mass of the population, by want of water was compelled to cease sluicing and puddling operations and prospect for new resources, the discoveries of Forty Foot and Whitehead's Lead, have been ample proofs that Jim Crow is not so nearly exhausted as commonly reported, and I am much mistaken if not the coming summer will witness the opening of ground equal to its predecessors. The alluvial workings, distinguished by a blue color, are all exclusively being worked by sluices or puddling machines, and the yield, although not extraordinary, still satis factory. Blind Creek is, on account of the sticky nature of the stuff, only adapted for puddling, and the lower part is fully occupied ; the upper, or southern part, bas been sluiced last year, and the internal, although gold more or less has been found throughout the length, has not been considered payable, the height of wash dirt only averaging 1 to 2 feet, and a deal of stripping therefore being necessary. I may here mention that within the last few days a party of Swiss Italians \u2014 Messrs. Guglielmoni and Co., sent from various large parties, mostly engaged in tunnelling, have returned from the Snowy River, reporting a very unpromising state of affairs, a circum stance that perhaps may create a reaction in the dwindling away of our population. Chinaman's Flat, near Stony Creek, has produced a very large amount of gold. The sinking averages 4 to 5 feet, and was ori ginally worked over by tub and cradle. Nearly all of the flat has these last three or four years been occupied by puddlers, and the returns been splendid, and even now patches of ground, in the commencement left as not payable, are yielding first rate wages. The flat is nearly all occupied, but the ge neral impression among the puddlers seems to be, that by the end of this season it will be pretty well exhausted. Accompanying, I have the honor to submit to your Honorable Board, geological plans.

The quartz workings, shown on the plans by a red color are: \u2014 Shicers's and Secret Gully, and the other patches of auriferous ground shown, have all been, and are partly now taken up for sluic ing ; all yielding a handsome return. Specimen Reef, (A. section VII.) between Wombat and Blind Creek, and opened about five years ago. Both the surface and the reef have been remarkably rich, but the surface having been sluiced, and the reef worked down about 70 feet to the water level, a company called the Specimen Hill, Quartz Mining Company, was formed, and the ground shown on plan by a green color, taken up under the leasing regulations. A grant of the lease has just been obtained, and tenders for the sinking of a shaft called for, and I hope ere long to see the company in full operation. I am also informed, that gold is distributed more or less all over the range between Blind Creek aud Long Swamp (C, Plan VII.), (in all probability attributable to quartz reefs, in many places cropping out on the surface along the range), but not in sufficient quan tities to warrant the cutting of new races. I believe gold has been got in the reefs just mentioned, but not in payable quantities; I trust, however, that ere long they will be thoroughly tested. Large quantities of quartz containing gold are available above the water level and I doubt not that when efficient machinery for bailing The Stony Creek Fall, at the bottom of Chinaman's Flat, is worthy of remark.

The fall is direct over the ancient lead or watercourse, which lead, as shown on section, has been worked by tunnels imme diately under and below the fall. perseverance. Considering that gold is always so partially distributed along any reef, the chances are greatly against a successful issue under such trials, and the expense of such a mode of proving it is a great barrier to final success. The same party also tested another reef situate a short distance to the eastward of the Coliban River, and about a mile from Tara dale, which gave similar results, and is still prosecuting the search. I have also shown the more important water races within these plans, distinguishing them by a red color, viz : \u2014 Another prospecting party has found gold on a new field on the river, near Malmsbury.

Belltopper Hill. \u2014 At this place Mr. Regamy is about to erect a steam engine to crush quartz. (Thomas Turner, Mining Surveyor ) Very little change has taken place in the general aspect of mining operations during the month. The various favorite localities of the lower part of Coliban River, of the Back Creek, the Talbot Hill, and the Reefs, still employ about the average number of miners, that for the last twelve months have con tented themselves on these gold fields. It is about a year since the great emigration from these parts to the Amherst district took place. Three claims are held on thai reef, but two of them are temporarily abandoned under the privilege afforded by registration, which secures the proprietorship although the owners be absent. The parties being short of funds are necessitated to leave their mines for a time to procure more means. Humboldt Reef. \u2014 There have been ten claims taken up aud worked on this reef, but four of them have been temporarily left for want of funds, and are held under registra tion. The quartz from these mines which has been crushed during the month is as follows, viz. : \u2014 With respect to particulars \u2014 a few diggers are persevering at a place called the Milk man's Flat, which is about a mile to the west ward of the township of Taradale, and in a part of the country but little tried before. It was a point of attraction some three months since, but not proving sufficiently remunera ting, most of the miners desisted further search. A party that lately was out pros pecting in that quarter has discovered a quartz reef, with good indications of its being au riferous. It is situate a short distance from this Milkman's Flat diggings. The test which proved the existence of gold was the washing, in a tin dish, some of the surface ground contiguous to the reef, being the detritus from it, when several grains of gold wore perceived.

(James Murphy, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 At One-tree Hill the Smyth's Creek Mining Company are progressing with their tunnel, in conjunction with which they are about to sink a shaft from the summit of the hill to a depth of 300 feet. A similar shaft is being sunk on Reed's Reef, You-you, by the same company; they have already sunk to a depth of 160 feet, and propose sinking 140 feet deeper, or to a total depth of 300 feet before they commence driving. Another company is being formed for the purpose of working the northern end of the You-you Hill, or that part intersected by Gillman's Reef, by means of an adit driven west at about 180 feet below the summit level, and with the view to intersect the numerous broken and contorted veins which abound in this hill. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 At Oram's Reef, on the road between Queenstown and the Kangaroo Ground (see general Plan), the prospect claim continues to yield well ; the average yield of all the quartz raised being 6 oz. of gold person, at a depth of 40 feet, the vein averaging 1 foot in thickness. The ground in the vicinity of this reef is intersected by quartz veins in every direction. An idea of the state of quartz mining in this district may be formed, by comparing the amount of quartz crushed at the Queenstown mill during the current year (which is about the one-fourth of the quartz raised by in dividual miners), with the number of in dividual miners employed. I need scarcely add, that it is very plain, that eithei a better system of working, or a little more industry is required to develope the resources of this division. The amount of quartz crushed at Messrs. Hamilton and Carr's mill at Queens town, from January 1st to June 13th, is 75 tons, and yielding an average of 6 oz. of gold per ton. Taking the average number of miners employed per month, this will give an average of about 2-67 tons per man per month. Approximate value of all mining plant in the division, \u00a38,050. I beg to state, that with the exception of a slight increase in the number of miners (partly owing to the return of some of those who went to the Inglewood rush) nothing of moment has occurred during the past month to warrant me in stating otherwise than that mining affairs generally are in about the same state as when I made my report for April, that is to say : \u2014 the alluvial miners are for the greater part earning a subsistence, and the quartz miners still laboring under the disadvantage of having to pay too high for their crushing. However, this evil which has retarded and still retards the progress of quartz mining in this division is about to be removed by the Messrs. Holmes and Com pany, who have selected a mill site, and propose erecting a King and Howland's crushing machine at Kingstown, and crush ing quartz at \u00a31 per ton. I anticipate as a result of this, that within a very short time the number of quartz miners will be very In alluvial mining, the only facts worth noticing are, that payable gold continues to be found in Hoddle's Creek, and also in Yankee Jim's Creek, and the Britannia Creek. Payable gold has not been found as yet in the Yarra Rivulet, although it has been pretty well prospected.

The locality is principally ranges covered with quartzose debris. There are several outcrops of reefs on the summits of the ranges, and a reef of considerable thickness crops out at the head of the gully in which the diggings are situated, from which I am inclined to think the auriferous deposits recently discovered have originated.

Old Post Office Hill Company North\u2014 The lode of the OldPostOffice HillCompany North has been opened to a depth of 150 feet and varies in breadth from 10 feet to 50 feet, the dip being always south-west. The company is now working several levels at a depth varying from 80 to 150 feet. The average quantity of the quartz crushed from the eight stamps is about 100 tons per week, and the yield of gold has varied from 1 oz. 10 dwt. to 3 dwt. to the ton. \u2022 Two are in course of erection.

The other claim is at the foot of the range and is on a lode known as the Poverty Point Reef. and the dividends have varied from \u00a368 10s. per man per week, to \u00a33 per man for the same period. This company has all its work performed by contract, and pays 5s. per ton for taking the quartz from the lode, and placing it in the bucket broken to a proper size for stamping The manager estimates that all the expenses of crushing, raising, wear and tear, &c , would he covered by a yield us 4 dwt of gold to the ton, and that all above that quantity would consequently be profit. At a depth of 12 \"feet from the surface various leaders, from 2 feet to 4 feet in width, have been struck, from some of which pieces of gold, weighing 10 dwt. and 15 dwt., have been obtained. Tredennick and party. \u2014 Tredennick and party, who hold a claim on the sume lode, have a battery of 16 stamps, and have been at work for a long period, their operations having been, however, at first directed to the crushing ol cement. This estimate is somewhat higher than one made by another company in the same neigh borhood, but the difference in the estimate probably arises from the different character of the lode, and the machinery employed. The average yield of the quartz in this claim, during the whole period of working, has been 5 dwt. to the ton, whilst frequently it has fallen considerably under that quantity. Old Post Office Hill Company South\u2014 The Old Post Office Hill Company South hold an adjoining claim to the company above named, and usually crush about 115 tons of qu irtz per week with their 8 stamps. The lode varies from 15 feet to 4 feet in width, and two levels are being worked, one at a depth of 50 feet, aud the other at a depth of 170 feet. The increase in the quantity of quartz crushed by this company is attributed to the fact that the stone is somewhat softer in their claim, and not to any diffrence in the machinery. This company's claim is being worked by shareholders, but, according to the estimate made by the manager, a yield of 3 dwt. to the ton can he made to give fair wages to the men working. The lode in this company's claim varies from 4 feet to 21 feet in width, hut the nar rower portions are always found to give the larger yield of gold. These three companies are at work on the top of the range aud have placed their ma chinery close to their shafts, a supply of water being obtained by means of dams. The general dip of the lode is towards the west, but in many places it is found to de scend almost perpendicularly, whilst iu others it takes almost a horizontal direction. Enterprise Company. \u2014 The Enterprise Com pany hold a claim to the north of those already named, and on the rise of the bill from the Gum Tree Flat. The lode in this claim has been worked to a depth of 160 feet, and the aveiage yield of the quartz has been found to be uniform from the surface. This company has the best paying quartz yet struck in this district. The battery con sists of 8 stamps, and the average quantity of quartz crushed is about 85 tons per week. The lode varies from 4 feet to 5 feet in width, and has been opened to a depth of 170 feet. The yield of gold has varied from 1 oz. to 1 oz. 10 dwt. to the ton, and the average dividend has been \u00a323 per week per man, during about eleven weeks, the time which the company has been engaged crushing. The company is now working three levels, at 80 feet, 100 feet, and 120 feet in depth The average amount of the dividends for the last six months ha6 been \u00a36 10s. per man per week. As this company is working by share holders they have kept no account of the cost of raising, but the amount of the dividends will serve to show the profit of the operatious. The quartz in this claim has also been found to contain a large quantity of mundic, but no experiments have been made to ascer tain the quantity of gold contained in it. in both these companies' claims mundic has been found mixed with the quartz when the water level has been reached, whilst above that hardly any has been discovered. The gold is saved by means of shaking tables and ripples. Both companies employ Porter's shaking tables, but they are about to try more experi ments to ascertain whether there is any loss of gold. The Llanberris Company hold a claim still further to the north, and on the Gum Tree Flat. The latter company has two other claims, one at a short distance to the south of their original claim on the Golden Point lode, in which a shaft has been sunk to a depth of This company struck tbe quartz at a depth of 150 feet below the alluvial ground, which was extremely rich when first worked, and has only recently been abandoned."], [317, "MINING SUBYEYOES' BEPOETS \u2014 JUNE. 133 The shaft has been sunk to a further depth of 30 feet, and a solid mass of quartz, about 70 feet in width, struck, which is now being worked by two levels, one immediately under the alluvial workings, and the other at a fur ther depth of 15 feet. This lode is some distance to the east of those claims already named, and is under stood to be a distinct one. The lode when first worked near the surface gave very good dividends to the men engaged, though the3r only employed a tub and cradle. The quartz contains a very large quantity of mundic, and is mixed in many places with veins of day slate. The company have now 12 stamps at work, and have taken out quartz from depths varying from 30 feet to 70 feet, but owing to the rotten state of the ground a new shaft is about to be sunk. The quantity of quartz crushed has been about 100 tons per week, and Porter's shaking tables have been used for saving the gold. The dip of the main lode is towards the west, but a vein has been struck which has been found to take an easterly inclination. This company have an immense body of quartz and their workings more resemble the operations carried on in a quarry than the ordinary workings of a quartz lode. The following returns will show the result of the operations of the company during the last three months:\u2014 Gold, \u00a31858 2s 2d; divi dends, \u00a31,012 10s.; labor, \u00a3366 14s.; current expenses, \u00a3191 11s. 5d.; wear and tear, tools, &c, \u00a3283 15s. 6d. The following returns of the quantity of quartz crushed and yield will enable an esti mate to be formed of the value of the stone: \u2014 80 tons, 21 oz.; 95 tons. 44 oz. 14 dwt.; 130 tons, 42 oz 10 dwt. ; 120 tons, 54 oz. 10 dwt.; 191 tons, 61 oz. 10 dwt.; 130 tons, 40 oz. 5 dwt.; 120 tons, 35 oz. 17 dwt.; 124 tons, 44 oz 5 dwt.; 123 tons, 42 oz. 3 dwt. The dividends were paid upon 15 shares, or at the rate of \u00a367 10s. per share. In the same gully there are three other companies at work, one of which, with a small battery of sour stamps, has been chiefly engaged in crushing for hire. The Cornish United C impany hold a claim a short distance to the north of the last named company, and has been working with a battery of twelve stamps, to which eight more have recently been added ; but, owing to an accident, work has been suspended for the last week. Cornish and Prince Albert Companies \u2014 The second, the Cornish Company, has been obtaining an average yield of 6 dwt. to the ton; and the third, the Prince Albert Com pany, has only just commenced crushing. The shaft was sunk to a depth of 130 feet through the old alluvial ground, when the clay slate was struck, and afterwards con tinned to a greater depth in the clay slate. About one mile and a half along the same range, and in a southerly direction, three other companies have recently commenced crushing operations. The average width of the lode is 20 feet, but in some places it has been found to reach a width of 34 feet. Canadian Hill Company. \u2014 The Canadian Hill Company have a battery of 16 stamps, worked by an engine of 40 horse-power. The dip is uniformly to the east, so far as the lode has yet been opened, with an incli nation of four feet to the fathom. The work has been carried on in one level up to the present time, but a second is being opened. This company has driven a tunnel into the range and struck into a lode 16 feet in width, but sufficient work has not been done to enable an estimate to be formed of the yield. Old and South Canadian Companies \u2014 The Old and South Canadian Companies have also recently commenced crushing, the former with a battery of 16 stamps, and the latter with one of 12 stamps. The quantity of quartz crushed during twelve weeks was 1560 tons, which yielded 510 oz. 10 dwt of gold. The total expenses of working are estimated at \u00a355 per week, but as the operations are being carried on by the shareholders, no account has been kept of the cost of raising, &c. Both these companies have lodes within a few feet of the surface, but sufficient crushing has not been done for au accurate account to be formed of the result of their operations. The quartz is found to be mixed with very large quantity of mundic, which is burned in a furnace, and afterwards placed in the amalgamating machine. I am now engaged in preparing a plan showing the various claims in which quartz lodes have been struck, with the bearings, &c, from which I expect to be able to show the dip of the different lodes, and their con tinuance in a north and south direction. Last Chance Company. \u2014 The Last Chance Company hold a claim in Specimen Gully, on a lode known by the name of the company by which it was first opened nearly on the surface. Owing to the great quantity of work neces-"], [318, "134 MINING SUBYEYOES' EEPOBTS JUNE. sary for obtaining the data upon which to base the plan, I have been unatde to forward any plans or sections during the present month. twelve stampers in full work on the ground, and are crushing at the rate of 150 tons per week. This company commenced operations a few weeks since, but were at first unsuc- cessful in saving the gold by means of blankets, upwards of one-half having escaped according to their estimate. They have now altered the system to shaking tables and ripples, and appear satisfied very little gold, if any, will in future be lost. Their last week's crushing was not very encouraging, as from 130 tons or thereabouts crushed, only 32 oz. had been obtained; but this they account for by saying that there were about 40 tons of mullock or rubbish included in the gross quantity, so that perhaps there were only 90 tons of pure stone reduced, yielding on an average upwards of 7 dwt. per ton, which, though not very good, would be made to pay with strict economy and a well-ordered system of working. As will be seen by the plan the ground adjoining the company's claim is applied for under mining lease by another company, but if the stone now on trial should not turn out better than what has been already tested, I fear the leasing company will hardly venture to further test the place ; the Germanic Company, however, expect their quartz will improve, and that their next crushing will be far in advance of the last, an event much to be desired, as the company, which consists of fifty-two share- holders, have now expended upwards of \u00a33000 since commencing the erection of their machinery, five or six months ago. Long Gully. \u2014 This place, though com- pletely abandoned for a considerable time, has been of late visited by a few parties in consequence of a 72 oz. nugget having been sound at a depth of 10 or 12 feet in the midst of old workings by a party of two men, who, failing to get full employment among the neighboring settlers at their ordinary voca- tion \u2014 splitting posts and rails, \u2014 decided on trying their luck at mining, and before many days had been passed at their new calling, they hit upon the preciovs lump. They have not, however, been getting much fine gold since or before, nor has any of the other parties been doing much either. Still 1 am of opinion there is a large area of auriferous untried ground in the district, which I believe would well repay the expense of prospecting, but, as stated in my last report, the miners are too poor to prospect in anything like an efficient manner, and therefore the ground has hitherto remained untouched, or but very partially tried. The Midland Counties Company, at Mount Misery, have been crushing during the last two or three weeks, and are in full hopes of obtaining good paying returns from their quartz ; but a3 they have not yet finished the lot in hand, there can be nothing definite re- As a large number of shafts are now being sunk in search of quartz lodes, the informa tion that will be afforded by the plan 1 am now preparing will serve as a guide to the miner in pursuing his operations as to the continuance of quartz lodes in lines parallel to each other.

As in case of the Germanic Company at Pinchgut, a second party have here also recently taken up the ground adjoining the leasehold of this company, so that if their quartz should be found up to the mark they, the new comers, would be in possession of the next claim to a certain extent tested or prospected for them at the risk and expense of the first company, who, though having observed the greatest saving and most inexpensive manner of work ing since commencing operations, 1 under stand have already expended upwards of \u00a33000, exclusive of their own labor. In the remaining portions of my division, matters remain precisely as stated in my last, except that there has been a small rush of late to a place called Splitters, in the vicinity of Old Italian Gully, where some five or six block claims have been taken up and about 70 or 80 men engaged. One party of 16 men are getting gold and likely to make good wages, all the others are sinking ; the depth is about 70 feet, and not very difficult to get through. Between this place and Whim Holes would be, in my opinion, a very eligible district for a prospecting party. I he price charged for quartz crushing continues \u00a31 per ton. also to furnish a plan of the claims now occu pied on quartz reefs in the northern portion of my district. For several weeks past this division has exhibited a much more flourishing appearance, as regards mining, than it ever has done since the first opening of the now abandoned allu vial leads. The excitement about obtaining possession of quartz claims has, during the month, considerably abated, still several large companies have been organised, and are either making their preliminary arrange ments or working the ground by coutract. It is the intention generally of these com panies to prove the quartz reefs to a greater depth than has been ever yet attempted. This I anticipate will be produc tive of much good, as the only two instances of deep sinking on the reefs in this vicinity have been eminently successful. Most of the reefs as yet discovered have been previously occupied, partially wrought, and unfortunately abandoned, through a want of efficient machinery and a disinclination to prove ground which was condemned on account of the poverty of a few feet below the outcrop. This evil is now past ; and al though many of the companies now holding quartz claims may from various causes be'un successful, yet I am convinced that a source of emolument will be discovered in some of these reefs which will be a lasting benefit to this district. No. 5, ok Buninyong Division. (J. W. R. Pringle, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 The plan I have now the honor to forward represents both the quartz claims and alluvial claims, as situated during the past month, several alterations having been made in the boundaries towards the south since my last plan was compiled. The Perseverance and All Nations are the only companies regularly crushing quartz. From the Perseverance, during the month, (200) two hundred tons were obtained, at a depth of 145 feet, and from a reef 25 feet in width ; the average yield was 10 dwt. per ton. From the All Nations, at a depth of 160 feet and a width of about 3 feet, 180 tons have been crushed during the month, yielding an average of 12 dwt. per ton. The Jenny Lind Company, on the Scandi navian Reef, and Imperial Company, on Hiscock's Reef, have struck quartz of so promising a character as to induce them to obtain crushing machinery, which it is ex pected will soon be erected. The Standard Company, Hiscock's Reef, have, at 70 feet in depth, struck a vein, and obtained several tons of very fine looking quartz, but not having a stamping mill erected, a sample has been sent to Ballaarat, so as to have the stone tested. From the other companies on the various reefs no result as to the yield of quartz has yet been thoroughly ascertained, as most of them have but lately commenced work, and are now The machinery is as follows : \u2014 I have the honor to forward my report of the Buninyong division for the month of June, luropeans. lese.

Alluvial mining has apparently become of very secondary importance, for, excepting on the Durham and Napoleon Leads, there are no parties occupying frontage claims. On the Durham Lead the Pioneer Company have at last found deep ground. A bore was put in at the face to a height of 18 leet, and broke through. It is intended at once to raise a blind shaft, and prove the course and quality of the gutter. The Telegraph and John Bull Companies are both doing very well, and expect to realize considerably more than the claims at the western end of the lead, from which I obtained my former statistics Smythesdale proper, continues to yield steady returns. Since my last report a new claim at the north end of the township, has been bottomed aud very good prospects obtained. The sluicing operations of the Frazer's Hill Company have been attended with success ; their arrangements are so well ordered that about one thousand cart loads of earth are disposed of every week. They have a steam engine close to the creek, which forces the water to the top of the hill into a reservoir ; from which it is conducted to whatever part of the hill it is required. The Black Hill Puddling and Sluicing Com pany have determined upon a reorganization of their company, they have sufficiently tested the ground and have obtained 24 oz. from five hundred cart loads of earth. The run of deep ground alluded to in my last report as having been found in the Great Britain Company, has since then been very poor, the average produce, in full, not exceed ing fifty shillings a man per week. The Franklyn Company, at the west fence of Learmonth's Pre-emptive Right, have broken into a gutter 25 feet in width, con taining a wasli of a light, gravelly shingle, on a very hard bottom. The yield, so far as ascertained, is not great, but, as the gutter has not been satisfactorily proven, very little can be said as to the probable results. Had they machinery similar to that em ployed at Frazer's Hill, there can be no doubt hut that they would have succeeded beyond their utmost expectations. The extent of the claim is twenty acres, and the quality of the ground throughout is upon an average equal to the portion tried; about \u00a31000 ex pended in the fitting up of a good engine aud forcing pumps would, in the hands of sixteen shareholders, give about 25 oz. per week, supposing five hundred loads to be washed each week, which is a very moderate quantity. No. 6 Division. The present method of washing is very tedious and expensive, namely, conveying the earth along a steep incline from the mouth of the tunnel in trucks to a puddling machine situate at a distance of about one hundred and sixty yards from the orifice of the tunnel; by this process more than half the labor had been wasted, and hence their failure for the present. (John Lynch, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 I have alluded in previous reports to the tunnel party at Spring Dallah; I now send you according to promise, a map showing the tunnel, claim, height and contour of the hill tunnelled, and such other particulars as the features and other peculiarities of the locality present.

The Carngham and Britannia Keef have been taken up hy new companies ; there is a large steam crushing machine erected there by the Bri tannia Company, and another in course of erection by another company. In annexing my report of Clunes, I have the honor to state that the returns from the quartz workings on the whole equal lormer averages, whilst alluvial mining is very much on the decline. Perhaps I may venture to say that this latter result may be attributed to the difficulties and great expense of pros pecting the surrounding country, either for supposed continuations of leads or for fresh ground, owing to the depth of trap rock requiied to be sunk through. Unfortunately, too, the habits of miners generally have been such as to render themselves little able to undertake such risks. I need not mention the difficulty of miners in obtaining the as sistance of a inonied proprietary until their claims have been proved, to a certain extent, to be valuable. Thus the whole of the pros pecting difficulty here rests upon the miners. From a lack of capital the South Clunes Quartz Mining Company, and the Great Western Company \u2014 both leasehold claims \u2014 have become abandoned, although each com pany have fair prospects of striking continua tions of known reefs or alluvial washdirt. Excellent patches continue to be found at Lucky Woman's Gully, and Happy Valley. The North American Company, Happy Valley, have bottomed at a depth of 170 feet, and struck paying gold ; this indicates a deep lead runnin j towards Spring Dallah. A little to the south of this last named claim a lead called the Cape of Good Hope Lead has been opened within the month, trending towards the North American claim which it is sup posed to join at its eastern extremity. The Chinese population over the district are chiefly engaged in puddling the old gullies in horse puddling machines. Ckeswick. Division.

Southern Lights Company have abandoned their old shaft, owing to the ground coming bodily down, and sunk a fresh one, aud ob tained good prospects. John Bull Company are earning good wages, have also put down a new shaft from same cause as forementioned company. Have tested some of the wash-dirt, which promises a con tinuance of work for two years, at \u00a35 to \u00a36 weekly, with an occasional drawback for extra iabor, repairs, &c. The Lord Nelson Company have aban doned their present workings. On North Clunes a few small parries are believed to be doing well with a sluice and cradles, by reworking the tailings from aban doned claims. The Clunes United Comoany are getting from 6 to 7 dwt. per ton, crushing about 100 tons per week. They have not commenced to go deeper, but are about to do so. Dam. \u2014 The large dam here appears to be a strong work, and likely to stand any pressure of water it cau meet with. I am told that the miners will keep it in constant repair. The Alliance Company have just put down their third shaft on their northern boundary to the water-level, 85 feet, with a view of testing the direction of the lodes from the north, and opened out a cross cut. By the western drive in 15 feet, they cut a reef 3 feet wide, which looks well ; eastward, 30 feet, have just struck a vein, width not proved. This stone is all very promising. The company's machinery is still being em ployed by the Victoria Company. At Creswick there has been a general dul ness pervading the alluvial mining (with the exception of the Bald Hill Lead) throughout the month, and the yield of gold leas than usual; there are, however, indications of new and paying ground being opened. At the Bald Hills Lead those claims that are getting gold are averaging from \u00a310 to"], [323, "MINING SUBYEYOES' BEPOETS \u2014 JUNE. 139 \u00a315 per man weekly, and the prospects are becoming more encouraging each week. The shaft on the private property is bottomed at a depth of 160 feet on the reef; gold, how ever, has been obtained on it, and the party intend sinking in the reef, and driving to the deep ground. have for the present discontinued crushing the stone of that company on a trial yielding about 3 dwt. to the ton, and the company are engaged in sinking their shaft deeper for a further trial. The Grul'itz Quartz Company at Slaty Creek diggings have also had a trial of their quartz, and which yielded only 3 dwt. to the ton ; the company have, therefore, suspended operations for a time. In German Gully, to the north of Samson's Gully, deep ground has been proved by Spargo and party: their shaft has been sunk through 5 feet of brown or chocolate soil, then through 60 feet of basaltic rock, then through 35 feet of stiff black clay to the wash-dirt, which is 9 feet in thickness, and yielding 8 dwt. to the load. There is a good deal of water in the rock, but it will when properly puddled offer little hindrance to working the ground, as the stratum underneath is very stiff and impervious to water. Three other companies have had large quartz claims surveyed this month\u2014 one on George's Reef, for forty-eight men ; one at Slaty Creek, for sixty men ; and one at Opossum Gully, for twenty men. I have been unable to obtain any correct returns from the Hard Hill Crushing Com pany, who are steadily and constantly em ployed crushing cement, tailings, and refuse from puddling machines, &c, about the Lard Hill, but the current report is that the returns are good, and I am aware that the company are eagerly buying up all the refuse they can, whilst two other parties are about erect ing machinery for a similar purpose. At Pinchgut Gully, in Bullarook, a party prospecting for the continuation of the lead have found some nuggets and coarse gold, and thereby caused a small rush to that por tion of the district, and will probab'y be the means of extending mining operations, as I consider all that portion of Bullarook Forest adjoining the Jim Crow district auriferous and traversed by quartz reefs : owing, how ever, to the dense and almost impenetrable forest it has never been thoroughly tried. Gokoon Division. (J. B. Cusack, Mining Surveyor ) The anticipations that were formed at the commencement of winter that there would be a long sluicing season have not been realized, the quantity of rain which has fallen not hav ing been sufficient to set all the companies fully at work. Only two races on the Back Creek, one on Slaty Creek, and one below their junction, have had enough of water for constant work ; the other sluicing companies by means of dams and reservoirs conserve as much water at night as enable them to work from six to eight hours per day.

The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Prince of Wales Company, the adjoin ing party on the same reef, are erecting their machinery, and hope to commence crushing about the middle of July. Two new claims have been taken as quartz claims to the west of Frenchman's Reef: no settled reef has yet been proved, but several good specimens have been taken from broken quartz lying on the surface, one of which is a beautiful piece of gold and quartz weighing 4 oz. 18 dwt., of which only about 1 oz. is quartz.

The Mount Hope Company are down 200 feet in a main shaft on the Lone Star Reef; at 125 feet they struck water, and at the present depth they get from 500 to 600 gallons per hour; in one point of view this will be very valuable to them, as they can conduct it into their dam and render themselves independent of winter or storm rains. The leaseholders of the other reefs on Gordon's, are active in forming companies, but have not commenced any mining ope rations. Fisher's Reef. \u2014 This reef is still in the possession of the original proprietois ; the last quartz crushed some months ago gave such a low yield, that the parties ceased working, but have again commenced taking out quartz near their former works ; the quartz is of a superior quality ; from appear ance, should go at least 2 oz. per ton ; the gold is coarse and bright ; the reef at 40 feet is about 5 feet thick, but they do not take out more than 1J feet. At 185 feet they have driven along the course of the reef north and south 27 feet; the reef is solid and well defined on the north end, but is a good deal broken and mixed with slate and sandstone in the south end. The character of the quartz is changing with the increase of depth, containing less sulphurets and iron than near the surface; the average thickness of the reef 1 feet at the pre sent depth, aud preserving a uniform dip of 3 to 1. Mount Egerton. \u2014 The Roue Company, Little Hill, are busy completing their dams, and preparing for their machinery which is to be on the ground and ready for work within four months; they have at present about 1200 tons of quartz raised on the surface; the dis position of the quartz on this bill is different to any other reef in the district, having an east and west reef, bisecting the north and south vertica Ireef, and extending 60 feet east from the point of contact, and dipping north at an angle of 45\u00b0; it is of a wedge shape, being 14 feet thick at the junction with the main vertical reef, and reducing east to its extremity where it is only 2 feet thick; it preserves the same dip and proportions to a depth of 147 feet, which is the greatest depth at which it has been worked; the vertical at 147 feet level is 8 feet thick on the north end, and 1 foot 6 inches at the south for a length of 230 feet, the only extent opened ; the quartz is white and porous, the gold coarse, the con taining rock a deep blue slate and sandstone. Leviathan Reef \u2014 Mount Hope Company: \u2014 On this reef the main shaft is down 1 10 feet ; on the east side of the reef the bed rock is a hard ferruginous sandstone, containing several quartz leaders, varying from 1 inch to 1 foot in thickness; striking off from the reef downwards, the reef at this depth is much jointed with pipeclay and slate, and like the Lone Star Reef contain sulphurets, the average thickness is 5 feet, the dip east 3 to 1, they have had no quartz crushed this month as they are making alterations in their amalga mating process. Jane Hope Company (situated at the south end of the Mount Hope Company and em bracing the southern end of the Lone Star Reef; have commenced work; they struck the cap of the reef at 24 feet ; the reef at 28 feet is 2 feet thick, it contains some very fine gold, generally seen on the iron oxide, which is coated over the quartz joints; at 40 feet the reef is 3 feet thick, with less iron, and the gold is of a courser character; they have not had any quartz crushed yet. Large Hill, Mount Egerton. \u2014 No 2. north claim, have had three separate quantities crushed amounting to 45 tons and yielding respectively 6 dwt., 9 dwt., and 21 dwt. per ton ; the thickness of the reef at 70 feet where this quartz was taken from is 2 feet. No. 3 claim crushed 94 tons from a depth of 100 feet, which yielded 15 dwt. per ton ; the reef at this depth is 10 feet thick, but only 6J feet of the east side were taken out. Kangaroo Company. \u2014 The mining opera tions of the company for this month were confined to sinking a shaft on one of the company's reefs (Hick's) to a depth of 100 feet, and taking out 20 tons of quartz at 30 feet level, the yield of which was 7J dwt. per ton ; this reef, which was hitherto but little worked, is improving in quality and in creasing in thickness in proportion to its depth. No. 4. \u2014 On the north end of this claim at a depth of 130 feet, the reef is only a few inches thick, they have sunk to 180 feet, and are driving east and west; they went through several quartz leaders, varying in thickness from one inch to one foot, they are all con verging towards the centre: their convergence would bring them in contact at about 250 feet where in all probabiity the reef will again re-form.

They still continue driving to the west, but have not yet found the Brown vein. The Perseverance Company have, after a period of eighteen months since their appli cation for lease, completed the erection of their shear legs and hoisting apparatus. It is not their intention at present to fix their pumps, but use hides, as the Steiglitz Com pany North will pump sufficiently to keep them free from water for their present operations. I remarked in one of my latest reports how inefficiently this company had carried on their operations up to that time owing to their incapable directory, and this in merely preliminary operations ; these same remarks will apply equally to them now. When this ground was worked under the title of the Leviathan Company, a vein was followed underlying to the east. This has never been scientifically examined, but from the composition of the quartz brought to the surface there is reason to suppose that the original vein has been lost, and a barren vein taken up and followed in its stead. The break in the srrata, which at this portion of the reef was nearer the shafts than at the north or lower portion of the township, justifies this conclusion. The directory notwithstanding this, and although this vein has been found for a considerable distance to be worthless, are now about to spend their money in widening and slabbing this underlying shaft, which to the cost of two companies has already been proved leads to nothing. To the east of Mount Egerton, and west of the River Moorabool, the country is of an auriferous character, the gold is very generally distributed, and some large quartz reefs are cropping out on the top of the ranges, but with the exception of one reef (Mount Wilson) which is being applied for under lease, there is little else done to develop the place. An extensive belt on the west side of the Werribee River: \u2014 Near its source there area few parties working surfacing and shallow sinking ; there are several quartz reefs near the place where these workings are going on but they have not been opened yet, and for miles the country presents a highly auriferous appearance. Steiglitz Division. (Thomas Woolgrove, Mining Surveyor). I have the honor to forward you my report for this month, aud which comprises as far as the progress of mining matters on Steiglitz is concerned very little in addition to my last month's report. The population is very un settled, owing to the reasons I gave in my last report, and until things assume a more decided shape in reference to the operations of the mining companies here, it will remain the same for some time. The Gibraltar Company are obtaining very good quartz in their deep ground. They intend erecting large machinery for pumping, &c, in the place of their small and inefficient one There is no doubt if such machinery is applied, and a larger number of miners employed, the ground held by them will prove highly remunerative.

The proprietors of the Sailor's Reef have let the working of their ground and the use of their crushing machinery to a party of miners on a certain percentage, as it was found ruinous to continue the original plan of employing men on wages. I believe, up to Ihe present time, the results to these miners have been satisfactory.

The ground on New Chum Reef leased by Messrs. Pyke and Trench is now being worked, the quartz raised and stacked, await ing the erection of the crushing machinery. The operations hitherto carried on by this company give promise of fiist-rate results."], [326, "142 MINING SUBYEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 JUNE. It is the intention of this company to erect very large and powerful machinery, and to crush at a cheap rate. This will be a great boon to this district, as twenty reefs, which are now abandoned, will then pay for being worked. Owing to the results obtained on this creek, the workings on the Moorabool are compara tively abandoned for the present; but 1 hope that the table land will prove remunerative where it is at present being worked. If so, these diggings will revive again, for there will be ground sufficient to employ thousands of mineis for their lifetime. The Malakhoff Claim is still producing very rich quartz, and that in their deepest work ings. The Wellington Reef Prospect Claim, for merly applied for under a lease, but which has been withdrawn lately, has been again taken up, and is producing rich quartz. They have some tons raised, but will not crush for some time. BEECHWOrvTH MINING DISTRICT. Spring Creek Division. (H. Grimes, Mining Surveyor.) The New Year's Reef Prospect Claim have lately crushed 15 tons; the results were 11 J oz. per ton. I may remark, that in this case the dip of the gold (referred to irr a diagram sent last month) was south, and still continues south. This reef has been abandoned by all parties except the Prospect Claim party, but, owing to the good results above, has been again occupied. The population engaged in alluvial and quartz mining is at : \u2014 The Birmingham Reef Prospect Claim is still producing very good quartz.

Sluices are being conducted from a long dis tance along the sides of the claims, and to the mouths of the various tunnels, which are being carried into the hill with great dispatch, 4 to 5 feet of wash-dirt is taken ; and from the general good management throughout, there is every reason to suppose these dig gings will employ a large number of miners for some years to come, and pay them all well. There have been cases where 1 oz. 27 dwt. to the tub have been found ; but as an average, \u00a35 per week per man may be reckoned.

In the Nine Mile Division the most important work in operation is that of the Ovens Water Company. The contractor has 142 men at present employed on the works opening up the springs, excavating the tunnel, cutting the race from the mouth of the tun nel to the reservoir, (I stated in my last report that this was finished, but owing to some error it has had to be cut over again) and cutting a tail race for the purpose of sluicing the ground intended for the reservoir, a most remunerative method of getting rid of the soil. On Hurdle Flat sluices are in full operation, aud a great number of parties are busily engaged re-working, on improved methods, the bed of the lower Nine Mile Creek, In the Yackandandah Division nearly all the hill claims are well supplied with water, and mining matters in the division progress very favorably. The fine weather that is prevailing prevents the supply of water from being abundant for this season of the year. The miners are making pretty fair and steady wages ; several parties have been passing through for the Snowy River, but they are chiefly from the lower diggings. At BoWmau's Forest the lead is being very slowly defined, up to the 10th claim only as yet. The plan I send enclosed is of Silver Creek, a great part of which will be worked to ad- Vantage when the Hurdle Swamp reservoir is in working condition. I have to report the discovery, during the month, of two quartz reefs, one (being the second) on Twist's Creek and the other on the range which runs along the northern side of Clear Creek. The stone looks very well, but none of it havirrg, as yet, been crushed I am unable to give any return of the yield. Snake ValleV and Yackandandah Division. (Thomas G. Kenan, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 I have also had instructions from the warden of the Yackandandah Division to make a survey for a party requiring a lease of ten acres as a site for a reservoir. This is the first application since the issuing of the leasing regulations. I herewith forward a plan of Twist's Creek showing the worked ground along it aud the position of the quartz reefs. The workings along the creek are very shallow, seldom exceeding 4 or 5 feet, with a sandstone and slate rock, the gold coarse but very patchy. There is a pretty good supply of water during the winter season, but not sufficient for one sluice in summer. Five parties are at present engaged in working there, exclusive of three parties on the quartz reefs. The machinery is as follows :- Alluvial Mining : \u2014 Puddling mills ... 5 Note. \u2014 The number of European miners has increased during the mouth, while that of the Chinese has diminished.

The Pioneer Company's dam also burst, sweeping everything before it.

The Oriental claim has at length struck gold. The Township and Alliance Companies have not yet succeeded in finding the gutter, though both companies have driven considerably from their second shafts. The machinery is as follows: A few claims on the Suffolk and New Ballaarat Leads are still producing good wages, and the Chinamen make a good living out of the upper claims. Quartz. \u2014 The quantity crushed during the last month amounted to 60 tons, producing an average of I oz. 18 dwt. to the ton. One lot of this (21 tons from the Maiden Reef, near Cornish Town,) averaged 3 oz. to the ton. A further quantity of 22 tons was crushed, and the results were insufficient to pay the expenses. The Magenta Keef Com pany have got into difficulties which resulted in the sale of their machinery, which is to be removed to Morse's Creek. The cost of crushing has been from 20s. to 30s. per ton, according to agreement. I have nothing to report of the Indigo Main Lead, except that a few parties have taken up claims as for old and abandoned ground, and it is probable that, with abundance of water, much of the old leads might be made to pay, if leases were granted to the miners. The population is very unsettled, with every probability of becoming more so as the sprirrg advances. Many are already en route and others preparing for the Snowy River diggings. A claim nearly opposite the Devonshire Lead has just struck a gutter of more than average richness, and it is supposed to be at the junction of the two leads, but this is not yet proved. The Hit or Miss claim, situate about the supposed junction of the Caledonian with the Indigo Lead, has at last obtained a payable prospect, thus proving the continua tion of the lead so far. Bdckland Division. (R. H. Stone, Mining Surveyor.) I have the honor to forward to the Board of Science my report of the Buckland division of the Beechworth mining district for the month of June, 1860. Since my last report there has been little alteration in the progress of mining affairs in the Buckland portion of my division, but very little is doing in alluvial mining. All the river claims, and those in the wet flats, which are at present the moat payable, have been flooded out, and considerable damage has been done by the water filling the claims. The Buckland river drains such a large area of mountainous country that the river rises very suddenly, and it is difficult to bank the water out. The Caledonian Lead is almost exclusively in the hands of Chinese, with the exception of the lower part below Christmas Town. The Durham Lead has proved very patchy all through, and most of the poorer claims have now passed into the hands of Chinese. The better claims are still worked by Euro peans, and produce good wages. The Kincardineshire Lead is still producing fair wages in some of the lower claims, aud part of the upper end is taken up as old and abandoned ground. During the month the quartz mining com pany on the Nelson Reef have been con tinuing their workings ; they are not, how ever, able to make it pay to crush by steam power, arrd they are now about erecting their water wheel. The engine they have lately disposed of for the sum of \u00a3250 to Messrs. Perry and Co., of the Ebenezer Reef, Growler's Creek. A few claims are still working on the Victoria Lead, but hitherto with indifferent results. The Adelaide Lead has presented the usual features in all the leads in this district, being very patchy, and the claims consequently are of very different values. The lower part of the lead is the best, and as it approaches the Indigo Lead, the washdirt will average 1 oz. to the load. Another quartz reef has been proved to be auriferous, which is situated in a small creek Nu. Horse-power.

The reef I mentioned in my report for May, as lying below the alluvial workings, is still being prospected, but there is nothing further to report respecting it at present. Messrs. Mackay, late of Myrtle Creek, have also just purchased new machinery, to be erected on the Ovens River ; and Mr. Johnson Stevens, of the Elgin Reef, has also purchased a powerful engine, lately the property of the Magenta Quartz Mining Company, on the Indigo. It is capable of driv'ing eighteen stampers, and is also to be placed on the Ovens River. It is also rumoured that another reef has been discovered, showing rich specimens, but the locality is kept secret at present. I have no doubt, that should the ranges on the Buck land be prospected as thoroughly as those at Morse's Creek and the Ovens River, several good reefs would be sound. Surface quartz abounds on these ranges, with some few large reefs croping out, and rich specimens containing very coarse gold have been picked up. There is an abundant water supply for crushing, and also for motive power during ten months iu the year, should any of these reefs prove payable to work. A water power crushing mill to drive eight stampers, is also being erected on Richardson's Reef, Growler's Creek, but I do not think they will have sufficient motive power to work for more than a mouth or six weeks this season, when Messrs. Richardson will he de layed to obtain a steam engine. The engine purchased by Messrs. Perry and Co. is also shortly expected to arrive from the Buckland. Should the reefs in this district prove as gen erally payable as appearances indicate, still more machinery will shortly be required; and it may be remarked that in the Ovens River there is always sufficient water, if advanta geously applied to drive at least forty stampers in one mill ; and, as the river has considerable fall in this part of the district, the water might easily be raised to a sufficient elevation to work breast shot wheels or low pressure Turbines. During the month there has been an asso ciation formed for prospecting quartz, and one or two private parties are out for the same purpose. In the Ovens River portion of my division quartz mining continues to prosper and new reefs are being discovered weekly Fourteen new reefs and veins have been registered during the month under the following names : \u2014 Scotchman's Reef, McNulty's Reef, McAlpine's, Devonshire, Caledonia, Golden Bar, North Star, Union, Somerset, Hope, William Tell, Derbyshire, Morayshire, and White Star. Most of these, however, are at present only small veins, from nine inches to a foot and fifteen inches in thickness : the Golden Bar being the only large one and the only one from which quartz has been crushed, it is at present very poor. There is but little doing in the alluvial workings in this portion of the division, but those parties at work, (who are all sluicing) are making moderate wages. The workings on the Ovens River, have been principally confined to its banks, but it is the general opinion amongst the miners that there are heavy deposits of gold in the river bed, the difficulty of working being the expense of efficient pumping machinery. Very good prospects are said to have been obtained from some parts of the river in seasons when the water has been lower than usual. There has been but a small quantity of qnartzcrushedduring the month, irr proportion to the amount of machinery in the district. The Oriental Company's and Messrs. Chal mers and Gitchell's machines have been idle the greatest part of the time ; this is partly owing to state of the roads, which, in con sequence of the heavy falls of rain, have been almost impassable for heavily loaded drays. The tramway from the Oriental Reef belong ing to Rossiter and Co., has also been under going repair and alteration, so that no quartz could be obtained from this source. Messrs. Rossiter's mill also has been idle for some days; during the last week, however, their tramway, and that of Messrs. Chalmers and Gitchell, have been completed, and the mills have all again started working. The resident mining population is steadily on the increase, although many who arrive are again compelled to leave, unable to obtain immediate employment; and it cannot be too generally known, that unless some new alluvial workings are discovered, this district is no place for a rush. There is as yet com paratively so little capital invested in the reefs, that labor is not in demand in propor tion to the number discovered, nor will it be until there are increased facilities for working them. With a few exceptions, of those reefs from which quartz is being crushed, the claims are occupied by two men in each, who are the owners, and who are still prospecting; four months being allowed for that purpose. The following tables give the number and description of the resident mining population, and the number and description of machinery at work and idle iu the division: \u2014 Messrs.

Rossiter and Company's and from Cotsworth and Company's claims. Messrs. Chalmers and Gitchell have just commenced a contract to crush 2000 tons for Messrs. Butler and Co., the prospectors, and the yield is said to be very good ; I have not been able to find out the amount, but I be lieve it to be even better than from the other claims judging from the appearance of the quartz No quartz has been crushed from any other claim, in this reef during the month.

Considerable quantities of gold can be seen iu many of the quartz. Mr. Stevens has purchased a fourth share for \u00a3600 On the Elgin Ueef, Messrs. Stevens and Company have not yet struck the second reef; it had appeared to re-form, but has now run out, and there is so much surface water leak ing through the rock, that they are unable to sink further at present ; they are now taking out the surface quartz and their portion of the boundary wall. The quartz from the lower part of the reef did not yield nearly so well, but Mr. Stevens informs me that the entire claim has averaged a little over 18 oz. per ton. In the prospectors' claim, Messrs. Falconer and Company have still a consider able quantity of quartz to raise, and they are also driving two tunnels to work the cap of the reef where there is a large body of qmrtz which they expect will yield 15 dwt. per ton. The stone from their claim has not, 1 am informed averaged more than 6 oz. per ton. All the other claims on this reef are registered until the flow of surface water abates. Contiguous to the Woolshed are the West Briton and Cornishman's Reefs, which are both looking well, and considerable quantities of quartz are being raised by sonre parties, others prospecting for the continuation of the reefs. The Welcome Reef is also looking well, and in the prospectors' claim especially the quartz seemed likely to pay throughout. Several other parties are sinking shafts and tunnelling.

Some coarse gold is to be seen in the quartz, hut it is generally white and barren looking, and I fear that the expectations entertained of it will not be realized at present; the width is about 15 inches. Gander's Reef. \u2014 A considerable quantity of good stone has been crushed from the pros pectors' claim ; since my last report, a tunnel has also been taken in on the claim, from which an additional part of the reef is being opened up ; from the portion of the reef which has been before opened, fine payable stone is still being raised ; there is now a considerable quantity of water to contend with, as much as can be bailed out by men working day and night; the depth is about 50 feet below the level of the creek, and it will soon be necessary to erect an engine to pump out the water. I think this reef may be considered one of the best yet opened; the quartz which has been raised has, I am informed, averaged 6 oz. per ton, and the reef averages about 3 feet in width. The parties on the Pioneer Reef are still tunnelling, and the prospectors have struck a small leader containing gold, and are in hopes of being soon rewarded for the labor and ex pense they have been at during the last six months. On the other quartz reefs and veins which are prospecting, and which are mentioned above aud in my former report, there has not yet been sufficient work done to enable me to report particularly respecting them, but, gene rally speaking, the appearance of the surface quartz will justify the expectation of most of them proving payable. On Richardson's Reef, the prospectors are engaged in making a road for the conveyance of quartz to Mr. Hazleton's machine ; a sixth share in this claim has changed hands during the month for \u00a3600. The other claims are still prospecting for the reef. SANDHURST MINING DISTRICT.

The machinery is as follows: \u2014 As much of the alluvial ground that had been locked up, by being under application for lease, has now been thrown open to the individual miner in consequence of the appli cations having been withdrawn, several new puddling mills have been put up, and others that had been for a long time idle have re commenced working: it is also probable that others will be erected. Six new grants for mills and dams have been issued in my division from the warden's office within tiro last month; and, in general, I hear no com plaints among the puddlers, as most of them appear to be making a good living: I attribute this to the quantity of water at their com mand during the winter season; and, if a good system of economising the supply were carried out, I have no doubt but that the puddlers would be able to make good wages all the year round. The number of Chinese tub and cradle men is certainly on the in crease: they may be seen in every direction, not only sinking holes in the old gullies, where it is said that none but themselves can make a living, but they are to be found on the reefs also, paring off the surface of the soil and washing it in the nearest pool: the only complaint against them is that, in this way, they spoil a great quantity of water, as they never remain long in one place.

Should this reef become at all important, Ipurpose visiting the ground, in order to get more accurate information con cerning it. The Elysian Flat district is now nearly abandoned, although my impression is that both payable reefs and good alluvial ground will yet be found in that neighbor hood. Within the last week auriferous quartz has, in two instances, been picked up oir the surface at a short distance from the township of Neilborough. On the King Parrot some little activity prevails, owing principally to the sinking of deep shafts pieparatory to the thorough trial of the reefs Hurley and Co. and Ross and Co. are still raising stone on the Triangle Lead; expected to yield about 3 oz. to the ton. Adjoining these claims and northerly, For tune and Co. are sinking th\u00abir engine shaft; the present contract is for 100 feet only, but if necessary, it is intended to sink 200 feet, to thoroughly try the ground. Marnell and Co. are still raising good stone on this reef, and there is little doubt that had the best of the quartz been crushed by itself it would have yielded 20 oz. to the ton.

On the Carriers' Beef, one claim yielded 500 oz. of gold to 49 tons of quartz; and 10 tons of quartz from the same claim gave 17 J oz. of gold to the ton ; this reef I may mention is most easily worked, no blasting being needed to raise the quartz. The Providence Reef, two feet thick, has averaged 2J oz, to the ton ; and Thrupp's Reef on the same hill, has averaged 3 oz, to the ton, with a reef ten inches thick. A new reef has been struck near the flat leaders, about three miles south-west of the township of Yea, and specimens obtained from it, equal to any found in the district. Kilmore Division, (F. M.

(Robert English, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Two other quartz crushing machines, con tiguous to the principal quartz workings, are now in course of erection of the aggregate power of fifty (50) horse, and as a large quantity of stone (although not of a very auriferous character) is available within a short distance, with powerful machinery at hand, it is assumed that remunerative results may be calculated upon. I beg to transmit plan of the present workings, with sections of strata to the schist formation of Four Mile Flat, or the more re cent nomenclature of \" Hornebush.\" The miners on this working, collectively, are do ing well, and besides those engaged upon the Main Lead, numbers are scattered in the va rious adjacent gullies, where the sinking is shallow, and who also, it may safely be as sumed from appearances, are making a good living. The last rush to this place, which set in two months ago, was occasioned by a party of prospectors, a short distance below the original workings, having struck payable gold (see plan, No. 1 shaft) ; average yield per load, 1 oz., with 2 feet thickness of wash dirt, the schist formation being soft white slate, with occasional bars of extremely hard blue slate. Almost immediately below this working a break in the lead intervenes be tween that and the second prospecting claim (see plan, No. 2 shaft), the yield from which is lj oz. per load, with the same thickness of wash-dirt, and bed-rock of the former de scription. From the latter working the lead has progressed half a mile without intermis sion, paying six claims wide, in some of which very rich drift has been found, although from adjoining claimholders only can informa tion of the yield of gold be obtained. I am also informed, that in many claims should a less thickness (say six or eight inches) of wash-dirt be taken, that as much as one pound weight of gold per load would be the result ; but inasmuch as from 2 to 5 feet thick ness of dirt is washed, the average yield upon the yield is computed at lj oz. per load. Note. \u2014 Two quartz crushing machines are in course of erection of the aggregate of 50 horse-power. I have the honor to transmit my report of mining operations in my district for the month of June. At Avoca Main Lead the ground is princi pally occupied by Chinese, consequently I have no means of ascertaining the quantity of gold obtained therefrom, but the opinion is, that they are doing remarkably well. A prospecting claim on a quartz vein, situate at the upper portion of the lead, has been granted to a party, which from surface indi cations promises to be of a highly auriferous character, but of which I shall be able to give more detailed information in my next month's report. At Lamplough, the Deep Lead (with the exception of minor rushes in the immediate neighborhood), offers sufficient inducements yet to a large number of miners to remain. The lead appears still to adhere (as originally) to the southern reef, neither does the work ings get into deeper or wet ground. It has already been found payable more than two miles in length from the original prospectors' claim, and three claims in width, the' average yield being an ounce to the load, with one foot thickness of wash-dirt. In my next month's report, I will furnish to the Board plans of these workings, with sections of strata to the bed-rock. The Mountain Hut aud Amphitheatre Diggings now retain a very small number of miners, exclusively engaged in horse puddling machinery, and although the wash-dirt in general is of an inferior description, yet from the fact of that being nearly all surfacing, and at present having a plentiful supply of water the miners are enabled to make good wages. Considerable difficulty at present exists as to the further course of this lead. Imme diately in advance of the workings very deep and wet ground has been sunk through, with unremunerative results. My impression is, that the run of gold will adhere to (what is prevalent in the whole of this district) the southern reef, diverging considerably in its present course, with the probability of trend ing near to where I have surveyed and laid off streets for business purposes forming the present township of Hornebush (see plan).

Hf-pbhrn Division. Mining Surveyor.) (Ambrose Johnson The population is as follows : \u2014 I have to report the discovery of the fol lowing new reefs : \u2014 Trogisch's Reef, near German Gully, Yan doit. \u2014 From this reef no crushing has as yet taken place, but the prospectors are raising payable stone, aud gold is being got in the adjoining claims, although not, i believe, in payable quantities. Boatswain's Eeef, Sardinian Eeef, and Christieson's Reef, all in Glengower Deep Creek ; but here, as in the former case, no quartz has as yet been crushed. The small ness of the population aud want of means, as well as the total absence of machinery in that locality, seriously ohstruct the development of this field, where, I am informed, gold has beerr got in a number of reefs as yet unopened. The claimholders, however, seem to be in great spirit, and several claims have been amalgamated with a view of offering greater inducements to capitalists for the introduc tion of machinery. Gold has also been got in the gullies in the vicinity, and I am of opinion that there is a fair field in the immediate district for a well organised and judicious system of prospecting, in which the millers on the ground would heartily co-operate. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Hatton's Reef, between Lanky Gully and Sailor's Creek.\u2014 All I can say of this reef is, that gold has been obtained; but the pro spectors seem to have great faith in their ultimate success, and I have no doubt that this reef will have a thorough trial. I have the honor to submit my report for the month of June, during which period no important changes have taken place in min ing matters in general. Quartz mining has during the last month remained much the same. Not a month passes but one or more new reefs are disco vered, good prospects, and in some cases even brilliant prospects, are obtained, a number of shafts started, and in a couple of months more the prospecting claim is, in most instances, the only one working. The want of system in working the quartz may in a great measure be the reason that our reefs do not appear to turn out as well as on other gold fields \u2014 at least, I am inclined to think so\u2014 for although I am fully aware of the natural difficulties, such as the patchy character and sudden strike of the reef, still in the few instances come under my personal notice where the reef has been worked in a manner that I could approve success has generally been the consequence, and the reef in most cases appears as regular as possible. Where the quartz is rich any way of working may answer, but where, with the exception of a few patches, the average is from J to 1 oz. per ton, the way of working makes a very From the old established reefs no important crushings have taken place, 1 oz., or there abouts, generally being the average. On Wombat Hill, the Cornish party, em ploying 15 or 16 men, is the only party working, and 1 believe averaging fair wages, more attributable to their way of working than to the good qualities of the stone. On the same hill, Messrs. Spence and Co., having puddled a lot of refuse stuff from abandoned shafts, sunk on thereof within their puddling claim, and obtaining 1 dwt. per load, have had about 13 tons crushed on trial, and obtained 6 dwt. per ton \u2014 a fact that goes far to show what an amount of gold has been, and is still being, lost by the mode of working generally adopted, and at the same time demonstrates the efficiency of Messrs.

As active operations will shortly be com menced, I hope in my next to be able to report the definite result of their first crush ing, which 1 have no doubt will be fully satisfactory. to lay out their money, and prefer trying their luck on other diggings ; but if fortune proves adverse, they soon find their way back to Jim Crow. Several parties are reported to be prospecting for new ground in the ranges between Hepburn and Blackwood, andldoubt not that good ground will ultimately be found in that locality. New Nuggety Reef, near Connell's Gully, is still turning out first-rate. The reef has, from the top to a depth of about 100 feet. averaged 2 or 3 feet in width, and the yield been about 3 oz. per ton, and the manner of working does credit to the owners. I shall, when the workings have been more extended, do myself the honor to lay plans and sections of this reef before you. In Messrs. Doney and Co.'s lease, adjoining north, the same reef is being worked, and looks very fair ; but the company's machine not being com pleted, the quartz is being stacked. The next shaft north is on Mr. \"Aillard's lease, and I am informed that a body of quartz has lately been struck, the quality of which, however, is not yet tested. Tunnelling is a branch of mining of which very little can be said, except in the event of new hills being opened, and such has not been the case during the last month. On the whole, I may, however, say, that most of our tunnels have for years been working in pay able stuff, and that the yearly produce amply repays the labor and expense in cutting the tunnel through the reef. Matters have, dur ing the last month, assumed a more lively aspect, in so far as the abundant supply of water has enabled most parties to wash up their (during the summer stacked) wash-dirt. On Table Hill, near Connell's Gully, a few claims have been taken up lately, and promise to pay well, whenever water at a sufficient elevation can be obtained. Messrs. Wardle and Co are bringing in a race, commanding Connell's Gully and surrounding ranges from Kangaroo Creek, the length of which, includ ing ahout 2 miles of fluming, will be about 17 miles, and the cost amount to about \u00a31 100 ; and when it is completed that part of the division will, during the wet season, present a far busier scene than for some time has been the case. On Pioneer Reef, Forty Foot, most of the claims, having been worked for a period of three months without striking payable quartz, have been registered. Claim No. 2 South has a splendid prospect, and in the prospecting claim, at a depth of about 60 feet, the reef looks very well ; and the proprietors, I un derstand, are treating with certain parties for the erection of machinery. Hamburgh Reef, in the same locality, is improving as a greater depth is attained. The first quartz crushed, taken from the top of the reef, yielded upwards of 2 oz. per ton, and now, at a depth of about 30 feet, 5 to 6 oz. per ton is expected. Alluvial sinking, has, generally speaking, been very dull, and is not likely to improve as long as the water supply is sufficient for puddling and sluicing purposes. When sum mer sets in, I have no doubt that as usual prospecting will be the rule, and it is more than probable that splendid results will be the consequence. A site for crushing machinery has been applied for on the Jim Crow Creek, near Franklinford, the erection of which, in reduc ing the price of crushing to its fair value, will remove one great obstacle to success in individual quartz mining. New Nuggety Gully, Yandoit. has, during the last month, produced a 277 oz. nugget, besides several smaller ones. I believe up wards of 100 miners are at work in the gully and immediate vicinity, and that when rumours of heavy finds now and again get abroad, such are not altogether unfounded. Puddling and Sluicing. \u2014 There is neces sarily a great sameness in these digging ope rations. The late rains have kept the miners engaged fully employed, and although no instances of singular good luck have come to my knowledge, still I think it may safely be inferred that at least wages are the average, as hardly anybody is heard complaining There has only been very little ground opened this season for any of the above pur poses \u2014 not that I think that payable ground is beginning to get scarce; but a great number of claims from last winter are still working, and the population has, for some unaccount able reason, till lately, been dwindling away. A great many, when they have got a start, do not consider the chances offered on Jim Crow of sufficient magnitude to induce them The Forty Foot Lead, so long neglected, is again beginning to draw the attention of the miners. The yield of the last claims worked the preceding year gradually dropping off, and the sinking being deep, partly through basalt rock, and the ground water being rather heavy, caused the lead to be ultimately aban doned, in fact, the prevailing opinion was, that it was altogether run out. Now, how ever, a company of twenty shareholders has been formed, and having made arrangements with the owner of the paddock opposite the Yandoit Hotel, propose to erect machinery"], [342, "158 MINING SUEVETOBs' BEPOETS \u2014 JUNE. The principal alluvial gold workings, shown on plans with a blue color, are: \u2014 and thoroughly test the ground. That the lead still exists there can be no doubt, but the carrying out of a successful mining speculation requires much attention, skill, and discrimi nation, and I hope that the company may reap the benefit of their energy. A small rush took place to a flat between Sailor's and Deep Creek, called the Emeu or White Horse Flat, in consequence of a shallow narrow lead being discovered. The ground found to be auriferous, was not however of any great ex tent, but the rush will also serve to draw the attention to the numerous flats and gullies in the neighborhood, where every indication of the auriferous character of the ground exists. Sailor's Creek. \u2014 Where the creek has been confined to a narrow bed, it has paid first-rate; but, in the flats, the gold has been distributed over too great an extent, and, although gold has been got more or lesj all along the creek, still it has not as yet been actually worked. Old Tom Gully. \u2014 The lower portion of this gully, coming within these plans, has also paid very well on its first being opened, and has, up to this winter, given steady employ ment to several parties: even now a few per sons sluicing whenever there is sufficient water, are making fair wages. The mining population, has, during the month, remained very much the same, and will in all probability remain settled as lung as the water supply is sufficient, and before that ceases, authentic reports from the Snowy River may be calculated upon. Lanky Gully has been remarkably rich, but the gully itself having been opened upwards of four years, and, during that time, been steadily occupied \u2014 these last years, puddled and sluiced by means of races from the head of Sailor's Creek, \u2014 it is now, same as most low ground, almost exclusively in the hands of Chinamen. It is, however, a gainings conviction that it would not be very advisable to go on arr un certain expedition, with so much ground in our own immediate neighborhood left un touched. The gold workings on the adjoining hills, commanded by the same races, are at present occupied for sluicing, in full work, and paying handsomely. Accompanying, I have the honor to submit geological plans No. VII and VIII, being continuations south of those previously banded in. It is supposed by many that Lanky Gully has derived Its rich deposits principally by intersecting the lead or ancient Watercourse shown under the basalt formation east of the gully (said lead being a continuation of the lead shown on the preceding plan No. VII, east); and although this lead has been found to decrease in yield southwards, aud, there sore, has not been traced farther than shown on plan, still I am inclined to believe such supposition well sounded. The quartz workings shown on these plans with a red color are the \" Emerald Reef.\" This reef has been opened for upwards of four months, and has, during that time, on an ave rage, paid 1 J to 2 oz. per ton. The workings in the prospecting claim have not yet been opened out to the boundaries of the claim, and the parties holding the adjoining claims have, therefore, not been able to sink with any degree of certainty ; the claims are, there fore, registered, but will undoubtedly be worked again if the reef holds out anything like at present. Taradale Division. Hatton's Reef, mentioned in the accom panying report, has only been so recently opened that nothing definite can as yet be said, save that gold has been obtained; but it is generally supposed that the richness of Lanky Gully is partly attributable to this reef, and 1 doubt not but that it will ulti mately prove very remunerative. (Thomas Turner, Mining Surveyor.) A new field has been opened on the east side of the Coliban Kiver, about half a mile from it, and opposite the township of Tara dale. The spot is in a narrow gully, perhaps three quarters of a mile in length, running north and south, between schistose ranges The depth of sinking varies from 4 to 20 feet, through a yellow clay deposit. Cooper's Reef, west of Sailor's Creek, has for years been abandoned, but it is said that gold has been got here ar-d there to a con siderable depth, and that the reef would be payable if proper machinery was at hand: as it is, with the nearest crushing machine three miles distant, and the roads all but impassable, this reef has not a great chance of being worked. About two hundred miners have congre gated there. The gold is coarse ; a small lump was found which weighed 1\\ oz.

I beg to state, for your information, that in tbe western province of this division, or that portion comprising the Anderson's Creek and Caledonia Gold Fields, mining affairs are rather dull at present, and have been during the past month, especially so at Anderson's Creek, where there can be said to be but seven men employed at quartz mining. The number of alluvial miners does not exceed a dozen, as both the Yarra Yarra Mining Com pany and the Yarra Yarra Steam Puddling Company have suspended their operations for the present. The Yarra Yarra Mining Company is said to have stopped on account of the quantity of water which flowed into their workings from Thompson's and Parson's Gullies during the late heavy rains; but the cause of the stop page of the Yarra Yarra Steam Puddling Company's works I have not been able to ascertain. The whole of the excavation done by this company during one year, under the management of Dr. Owens, does not exceed 300 cubic yards, of which about one-fifth was washing stuff. Kangaroo Creek, near Malmsbury, French man's Reef. \u2014 Another extended claim of 320 feet has also been taken up on this reef, making three held there. Messrs. Greshard and Co. are getting, on an average, an ounce of gold from the ton of quartz. Numbers of Chinese are busily employed along the creek's banks within the township, also at Yankee Point, half a mile south of the town, and along the banks of the Coliban River, north of Taradale. Nothing of interest has transpired at any of the other fields during the month. St. Andrew's Division. (James Murphy, Mining Surveyor.) On the Caledonia Gold Field, the state of mining affairs, although dull at present as regards quartz mining, great activity is anti cipated as soon as the machinery belonging to Messrs. Holmes and Co. is erected at Smythe's Gully, as the cartage and crushing of quartz is expected to be reduced to \u00a31 per ton. Those employed at alluvial mining look forward to the erection of this machinery with the expectation of being enabled to better their condition by turning to quartz mining, which they can then do under more favorable conditions than heretofore.

The average yield of gold was 4 oz. per ton. On the Britannia Gold Field alluvial mining holds out greater hopes of success than at any time previous to this date, as some very heavy finds have been made during the month of June in Yankee Jim's Creek. The richest part of the ground being worked is on the granite immediately above its junction with the slate. The gold is nuggety, and the party occupying the claim immediately adjoining the slate is said to be doing exceed ingly well, although all that I could get out of them was that they were able to make a living. Prospecting is being carried on in the direc tion of Steele's Creek, which I have no doubt will be attended with success, as I know that locality to be auriferous; and from the quan tity of quartz lying upon the surface, it is highly probable that the largest quartz reefs in this division will be discovered there. At One Tree Hill the number of quartz miners in employment is considerably less than during the month of May, owing to about 200 feet of the richest part of Swedish Reef being under a protracted litigation. A tunnel has been commenced at You You Hill by Messrs. James Shotton and party : this tunnel is being driven in a direction to intersect all the known reefs in that locality at depths varying from 77 to 180 feet, viz. : Reed's, Allen's, Hawkins's, Gillman's, and Barker's Reef3. Allen's Reef, at a depth of 70 feet, is sound to have increased gradually from about 8 inches near the surface to 18 inches. The yield is 4 oz. of gold per ton, and the workings are in a rather hard, fissile granite. An inspection of the accompanying table will, I am sorry to say, show a very consider able decrease in the number of miners, both European and Chinese. However, the number was less in the middle than at the end of the month, which shows that, although the number returned in the table is smaller than any I have yet sent in, still it is on the increase again, which shows that this decrease is only temporary. I herewith forward sheet 14 of plans illus trative of my division, being a plan of the Old Caledonia Creek, the locality where gold was first discovered on this gold field.

I have the honor to report that during the past month (July) but little change has taken place in the general appearance of the various mining operations within this division. Sago Hill. \u2014 In this locality there are some few parties whose claims continue to yield very handsome returns, while the majority of the parties at present working there are either engaged in seeking the deep ground, or, having found it, are obtaining only a very meagre return for their labor and loss of time; still there are those amongst them who en- tertain strong hopes of ultimately finding a rich lead ; and indeed the general appearance of the country, the nature and position of the bed-rock, and the general character of the alluvium, are so much in favor of that sup- position as to justify the entertaining of such hopes ; although, on the other hand, the past labors having been fruitless is almost sufficient to discourage them from further exertions. I have, in a former report, given my reasons for believing that a lead exists in this locality, and therefore conceive there is no need for me to go over the same ground again ; though I may state that, notwithstanding several of the companies have tested what they believed to be the deep ground, and were not successful in finding any auriferous deposits sufficiently lich to remunerate them for their labor, I am x 2 BALLAARAT MINING DISTRICT.

Campbell's Gully. \u2014 The several parties in this locality, the greater part of whom are engaged in puddling the surface and the old ground, are beginning to feel the want of water consequent upon the unusual scarcity of rain during this winter; indeed it is much to be feared, that unless we have rain shortly, the majority of these parties will be absolutely at a standstill, which will be a serious matter, as the greater part of the ground has been yielding very good returns of late.

The Swamp Lead. \u2014 Upon this lead there are three companies, viz., the Essex, tho Black Diamond, and the Durham.

The Leads. \u2014 The Inkermann is still being worked by the Allied Armies, the Ophir, the Independent, the Great Republic, the Hand in-Hand, the Leviathan, aud the Royal Saxon Companies. In consequence of some of these companies' claims being situated upon private property I am unable to state with what success they are being worked ; but of those upon Crown lands the yield is tolerably good. In addition to the claims above mentioned there are the Tannery Company's and the Southern Cross Company's claim ; the former company is still driving for, but has not yet struck, the gutter; the latter com pany is still sinking. Quartz \u2014 The Township Company has been compelled to discontinue operations for want of capital, and a new company with a sufficient capital is being organized to take possession of and work the claim. The average yield from the quartz in this claim is about 8J dwt. per ton, and I have every reason to believe that a company with a capital sufficient to carry on extensive operations would make it pay tolerably well. The Burra Burra Company has bad some stone from the portion of the Township Reef which lies within their claim, crushed, which yielded 6J dwt. per ton, and I believe they are about to make arrangements for the pur chase and erection of a very powerful crush ing apparatus. The Golden Point\u2014 is at present being worked by the Cosmopolitan and Koh-i-nor Companies, and is yielding very handsome returns \u2014 the latter company having recently discovered a large nugget weighing 834 oz., and numerous smaller ones weighing together about fifty (50) oz , in addition to which the wash-dirt is very rich. The Band of Hope Company has recently been remodelled, and has thereby increased the number of share holders and the amount of its capital ; the company is now sinking its shaft by contract and is down about feet ; it is believed that with its increased capital it will be in a posi tion to prosecute its operations with such vigor as to warrant us in expecting that ere many months elapse something will be known of the Golden Point Lead in this claim. There are several other companies pros pecting for quartz reefs in this division, but they have not yet succeeded in discovering any that will pay for working. I forward herewith a detail plan and section of the Koh-i-nor Company's workings; by the plan you will perceive the position in which the nugget referred to in former part of this report was found, viz., on the side of the gutter. I may here remark that the situ ation in which this nugget was found is similar to that of nearly all the other large nuggets on Ballaarat. I do not know of an instance where a nugget of any considerable size has been discovered in the deeper ground. I also forward two surveys of this claim, for the purpose of bringing the following subject The Nightingale. \u2014 Upon this lead there is at present only the Great Western Company at work\u2014 with what success I have not been able to ascertain."], [349, "MINING SUBYEYOES* EEPOETS \u2014 JULY. 163 before the Board, for their consideration : \u2014 A case of encroachment, or alleged encroach ment, took place some time ago between the Koh-i-nor and Cosmopolitan Companies, and being called upon to make a survey in the case, I discovered the singular phenomena of in two instances the reading from the back and forward stations agreeing exactly, yet in using each of those lines as base lines for the survey very different results are obtained. The plan marked A. shows the survey ad justed to a line, the bearing of which is South 0\u00b0 30\" East, and from the fact that the reading of this line from the back and forward station agreed exactly, I certainly presumed there was no local attraction about the place. The plan B. shows the same angles adjusted to a line bearing South 37\" East. The bearing of this line also from the back and forward sta tions agreed, and finding this to be so, I con sidered I had sufficient data for a very accurate survey with reference to the boundary : now it is plain that the needle must have been affected by local attraction in one or other of the portions of the survey, or perhaps in both, and the attraction at each station of the par ticular lines must have been so uniformly dispeised as to exactly balance, thereby allowing the reading at each station to correspond. The machinery is as follows Two machines in course of erection. Approximate value of all mining plant in my division, \u00a370,000. I have the honor to report that during the last month considerable activity has been manifested in quartz mining operations, and that this branch of mining is still occupying the attention of the miners within my district. The results which have been attained by the companies which have been crushing, though not what may be called brilliant, are still sufficiently remunerative to induce others to take up claims and expend both money aud time in the testing of the various lodes. In the best works on mining surveying, it is laid down as a principle, that to adjust a survey to one line is more correct than to depend on magnetic bearings throughout, which principle I believe has been generally adopted in extensive surveys on Ballaarat ; but as there are no means that I know of, of testing the accuracy of the position of this one line, astronomically, from the fact that sur veys are in almost every instance made from one shaft, I would therefore respectfully beg to be informed whether, in the opinion of your Board, it would reduce the amount of error, to take a mean of the magnetic bearings throughout the survey. Indeed, the eagerness for quartz claims has been such that hardly any likely ground remains unoccupied within my district, and prospecting operations are being carried on by numerous parties whose intention is to thoroughly test the lodes they may find within their claims. No. 3 Division. Where so many have taken up claims, there will, of course, be many failures, and doubtless much time and money will be expended in unprofitable operations ; but if even only one tenth part of those registered for claims should prove successful, an impetus will be given to mining on Ballaarat which will be profitable to the district, more especially as quartz mining operations are of a permanent character. (Thomas Cowan, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 As far as can be judged at the present time, I have reason to believe that a great deal of paying quartz will be struck, as up to the present time scarcely a lode has been effi ciently worked without yielding profitable returns.

Beyond the fact that this branch of industry is being carried on with unabated vigour, there is little to note since my last report, as the progress of such operations is necessarily slow, and the thorough testing of a lode is a work that requires a considerable space of time. No. 4 Division, (M. O'Malley, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 The new machinery that has been erected during the past month has not yet got fairly to work, or in such instances as crushing has has been regularly carried on, so little has been done, that no average can be formed of the yield of the quartz. Two or three new companies which have made trial crushings, express themselves as satisfied with the results they have already obtained, and are hopeful of a very long period of profitable work. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 In my next report I shall probably be able to give returns which will enable an average to be formed of the results obtained by the various companies now crushing within my district. In the alluvial workings I have no change to report. The puddling companies engaged in work ing the old ground, are obtaining their average returns, but their operations call for no special remark. I beg herewith to forward you a longitu dinal section of the gold workings, from One eye Gully, to the head of the Eureka Lead, showing the junction of the various leads, and the inclination of the surface, and of the bed-rock. Approximate value of all mining plant iu the division, \u00a339,400. From the section it will be seen that the course of the old streams, or gutters, corres ponds generally with the inclination of the surface at the present time, and that, though the course of the existing creeks is not identical with the gutters, yet the general direction is the same. This rule holds good for the whole of the gutters on Ballaarat except where they have been overflowed by the basalt, by which the course of the creeks appears to have been changed to their exist ing direction. I have the honor to forward with this re port a plan of Break o'Day, Frenchman's (Lower), Raglan, and other old gullies in the neighborhood of Rokewood. These gullies were first opened some two years since; and, as may be said of the sur rounding district for several miles, they were found to be patchy, some portions being highly auriferous, while others contained little or no gold, at all events not sufficient to pay ordinary wages under the rude system of working then (and indeed, 1 may say, still) practised in the outlying portions of this district. There have been several hand some nuggets found in the first named gully, and also in the shallow little gully known as Tommy's within from four to six feet of the surface, and, as is generally the case in similar positions, the claim at the junction of Break o'Day and Frenchman's gullies was unusually rich, so much so, that I believe the fourth party is at present obtaining a living by fossicking along the bottom of the old gully amongst piles of mullock in search The section will sufficiently show the depths of the various shafts sunk on the sectional line. The shafts shown upon the sectional line are now for the most part being worked by Chinese, and the information as to the depth, &c, has been therefore obtained from miners who have formerly worked on the ground. I may however remark that from my know ledge of the localities, I have no doubt that the information is perfectly accurate.

The auriferous drift, however, is only three or four inches deep, and imme diately overlies the slaty bottom or bed-rock, into which the gold is sometimes found to have entered several inches; but considering the great amount of dead labor expended in removing, or, as it is termed, paddocking the old mullock, and the small depth or quan tity of the wash-dirt when reached, \u00a3 am satisfied the majority of old ground diggers do -not realize upon an average five shillings per day per man ; and as far as my experience enables me to judge, I would say that matters are becoming less promising month after month, as there has been very little new ground opened of late, and of course the oftener the old ground is turned over the poorer it becomes; in proof of which I might instance the condition of the miners in the Rokewood district, which, 1 am sorry to say, is far from prosperous, and yet there are several quartz reefs in the neighborhood that have never been tried or prospected, and that are supposed to be well worth testing, but, as I have repeatedly stated, the miners themselves cannot afford to devote either the time or money necessary to prospect them ; however, sooner or later, it is to be hoped they will be taken in hand by men able to do so in a thorough and efficient manner. was supposed the lead or run of gold was tending to the south-west, or in the direction of the Plains ; and if so, quite possibly a long lead may have been discovered. Further north, on the east side of Moon light Creek, is situated Penrose Reef, on which one company is presently engaged in the erection of crushing machinery. This company got a few tons of their quartz crushed a few weeks since, at one of the mills on Staffordshire Reef, and obtained therefrom a yield of 14 dwt. per ton, which was con sidered so satisfactory, that they at once resolved on procuring machinery of their own. The original company or prospectors on this reef, have also been getting very promising stone from their claims during the last nine or ten months, at a depth of about 20 feet ; but before incurring the expense of crushing apparatus, they determined on sinking to a depth of 80 feet, and ascertaining if the quality of the stone at that depth would warrant such expenditure. They have not, however, as yet struck the reef at the lowest level, but are daily expecting to do so. There is nothing particular to report of Staffordshire Reef, which is now, I may say, entirely in the hands of four or five companies, who have lately applied for leases. A pretty good proof, after eighteen months' trial, that the reef has been yielding aud is still likely to yield remunerative returns, though the main reef has never yet been found. There are, however, a good many leaders, varying in thickness from 3 or 4 inches up to 30 inches. Some of these are highly auriferous, others quite barren ; and generally all are very liable to run out, and be lost after having been traced for some distance, which often causes considerable delay and expense in prospecting, before another is struck. The Germanic Confederation Company, at Pinchgut, have not as yet been able to obtain paying returns from their quartz, owing prin cipally, it appears, to their being unable to procure the necessary machinery to work or drain the portion of the reef that has been found payable. They are, however, perse vering; and though the yields hitherto ob tained have not been very encouraging (not being more than 4 or 5 dwt. per ton), yet they are sanguine that ultimately they will be more successful. The Midland Counties Company, on the contrary, I am happy to say, are meeting with better success. I believe their lowest crushing has been over 10 dwt. per ton, a yield that with good management could be made to pay very handsomely. However, they have not as yet got into full work; when they do, it is expected the aver age will be considerably over that amount. Whim Holes. \u2014 Mining affairs at present and during the last four or five weeks, have been very dull at this place. The shallow rush up near the Little Hard Hills, referred to two or three months back, is now almost totally wrought out and abandoned ; and as regards the deep sinking down the gully, to the northward, nothing definite is known, as the Progressive Company have not yet reached the gutter, though they are now nearly twelve months at work \u2014 the sinking being only 105 feet, without rock; they are, however, every day expecting to get into it, and thus determine whether or not this place shall be the scene of an extensive rush, or relapse into its pristine solitude. There has been a small rush during the month to a place called Doctor's Hill, on the west side of Moonlight Creek, a little outside the south-east corner of No. 6 Division. The sinking is about 45 feet, and principally through reddish gravelly clay and cement. The prospectors, four in number, had ob tained a tolerably good prospect (3 dwt. to a tub), but no other hole had been bottomed when I was last on the ground. I estimate the number of miners then there at 200. It There is nothing new to be said of the deep rock leads in my division, except that two companies (one Red Jacket, White Horse Lead, the other Round Tower, Frenchman's Lead,) have recently reached"], [352, "166 MINING SUBVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 JULY. the after-junction or trunk gutter, at a depth of abont 380 feet from the surface, after some sour years' labor, and have each time obtained excellent prospects, which, under ordinary circumstances, would be certain to compen sate for all their dead labor and enormous expense ; but unfortunately, one claim im pinges upon or overlaps the other, which has caused both companies to become deeply in volved in a tedious course of litigation that is likely to cost them many hundred pounds before it is settled. Moreover, the size of the claims, as originally taken up in 1856, was only about 3J feet per man along the gutter, whereas in similar ground one man is now allowed 85 feet of the gutter. Taking these unfavorable circumstances into account, I greatly fear, however rich the gutter may be, these companies will never get adequately remunerated for all their time, toil, and trouble. Whilst very little probability remains of any more new alluvial leads being discovered along the flats, it is nevertheless quite clear that years must elapse before those already known become so exhausted as to prove un reraunerative. Instead of any deficits being perceptible in the weekly dividends of the miners, I believe upon the whole that the alluvial flat upon which the township of Smythesdale stands never gave better returns ; a circum stance entirely attributable to a more improved and economic system of working. At each side of Smythe's Creek there are quartz prospecting companies at work, and I have been informed that one of these parties had lately succeeded in discovering an excel lent reef. No official announcement of the fact has yet reached me, but of the existence of such a reef I do not entertain a doubt. The extent and value of our alluvial work ings have hitherto operated against the development of our quartz reefs, but now that the mining public has been so much engrossed by quartz mining in the surrounding districts, where unexpected success have generally attended their efforts, we may naturally expect that the reefs of this district will no longer remain unheeded or unattended to. No. 6 Division. (John Lynch, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Beaumont and Mines Royal Company at the lower extremity of Smythesdale, are doing remarkably well, so are all the claims on the Hong Kong Lead near the Black Hill. At Browne's the old leads are chiefly in the occupation of the Chinese. So are the shallow workings on the surrounding ranges, Budgeon's Flat is yielding moderate wages; the United Browne's and Grand Junction Com panies are excellent; the Hand-in-Hand is still below mediocrity, a circumstance chiefly owing to the wide spread of the lead in this claim, and in a lesser measure to misapplied and misdirected labor. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Grand Junction Claim is situated at one end and the Mines Royal at another, both of which are very valuable claims ; and although the Hand in-Hand suffers depre ciation from an uncontrollable cause, namely, the wide spread distribution of the auriferous drift, I am nevertheless of opinion, that proper management would render it one of the most valuable claims in the district. The Victoria Reef has given 1 oz. to the ton at the last trial. The machinery is now in full working order. The works are not sufficiently advanced to send you special drawings of machinery, mines, galleries, &c., but I shall do so in due course. The Monte Christo,. North Briton, and Ph\u0153nix Quartz Companies arc working effectively. This I beg to forward you a report of my mining district, No. 6, Ballaarat, for the month of July, 1860.

There are two crushing machines nowready for crushing the cement, which abounds on the hills on large quantities, and which have hitherto yielded large profits to the miners there, with hand-crushing Berdans and other rude and ineffective appliances. At Monkey Gully, the Havelock, Falcon, and Prince of Wales Companies, are doing well. The Havelock particularly so. The Magna Charta, lower down the lead, and supposed to be on the confluence of Monkey Gully and Black Ball Leads, are expected to be into the gutter in a fortnight. Great interest attaches to this claim, in consequence of its distance from the defined portions of the leads, which is justly regarded as unfold ing the secret of the course of the leads for a considerable distance. On the Black- Ball, the Prince of Wales are the best rewarded, Set the Emu, Kossuth, Formosa, and All ations are realizing good returns. The Royal Standard Lead, at Linton's, which for a long time had been condemned as a failure, has been proved to be a paying lead ; beyond this fact, which has been dis closed on the claim of the prospecting party, no further particulars have become known. The machinery of the Atlas Company will be soon completed. This will be the most efficient machinery in the district. The Edinburgh Company have struck the bottom \u2014 their shaft will be a little too shallow. The Standard Lead passes to the eastward of the shaft. The Glanmorgan, Flying Buck, Grand Junction and Hibernia Claims, on the Standard, main tain unimpaired the high-paying character of the lead. The Monte Christo Company has been dis solved and a new one organized, who have ra-occupied the ground. At Derwent Jack's, a new company has been formed to try further the lost lead which proceeded from Gordon's Gully. Further north on the ranges, near Clarke's pre-emptive right, a party are prospecting for a quartz reef, under the leadership of the indefatigable prospector Capt. Finn. They have already obtained some good specimens. With the exception of these two companies, Derwent Jack's is quite abandoned. Nuggety, Bloomers, Candlestick and other gullies, together with the Hard Hills, are affording employment to puddling companies, chiefly Chinese. Shicer Gully is paying well ; the ground is tolerably rich and the sinking dry, shallow and inexpensive. A few months ago there were several companies prospecting the ranges about Linton's for quartz reefs, but they have since all unaccountably left (with the solitary exception of one company), leaving the place comparatively as much untried as ever. Nothing definite can be known of Spring Dallah until the cleft of the Rock Company or the Tunnel Company have brought their operations to the determination of the question. The opinion which I expressed better than twelve months ago, that the Linton and Lucky Woman's Lead would find their passage through or near the Tunnel Company's ground has been now fully confirmed. Sawpit Gully, between Spring Dallah and Linton's, is now deserted, one or two com panies having tried it without being recom pensed. At Slaughter-yard Hill, Lucky Woman's, the Menai Straits, and Reid's Companies are obtaining gold in large quantities. The Ivanhoe have passed through 70 feet of rock. The majority of the companies here have applied for leases, preferring that tenure to the more restrictive aud fluctuating one of the Mining Board regulations. Trewen's Paddock, to the north of the Ivanhoe claim, appears to me to be the outlet for the Linton Leads, then through the Success and British Leases, and finally join the Smythesdale, Browne's, and Italian Gully Leads, in or about the ground of the Try Again Company (the Tunnel Company). At Happy Valley, puddling 3eems to be more remunerative than in any other part of the district. There are several puddling machines in every gully there ; the precipitous nature of the over hanging ranges affording every facility for At Carngham, the Prince of Wales and Bedfordshire Companies, on Snake Valley Lead, are the only companies that can be said to be profitably employed. The Comet, Telegraph and Magnum Bonum claims, are valueless. At Preston's Hill (private property), claims are as usual exceedingly good. The quartz reefs at Carngham are the chief topics of interest lately. The Britannia Reef has turned out, at the latest trial, over 15 dwt. to the ton. An excellent steam crushing machine has just commenced work for the Britannia Company, and another is in course of erection for the Carngham Reef, which will be the most powerful and complete of its kind in the district.

The population is as follows : \u2014 The Red Streak is almost deserted, nearly all the claims have ceased to be worked, and the engines are either gone or idle; a portion of it is now taken up by a company for quartz mining. A number of the Chinese have also left the Black Lead, which must in the portion occu pied by them be pretty well worked out. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 Nothing definite has yet resulted from the rush to Pinchgut Gully, Bullarook ; the pros pecting party having lost their shaft, are en gaged in sinking another, and none of the other parties have as yet bottomed. The cement on the Hard Hill, Clark's Hill and Flat, is attracting notice from the reputed success of the Hard Hill Crushing Company; one party working cement on the Hard Hill, had this month, from a crushing of 5} tons, a yield of 28 oz. 12 dwt. 18 gr. ; in addition to the steam engine at present crushing cement, one is in course of erection, and two others are immediately to be erected. The Frenchman's Quartz Company have during the month crushed 260 tons, having a yield of 100 ouuces. The Prince of Wales Company, French man's Reef, have crushed 200 tons with only a yield 46J oz. which falls far short of what was anticipated ; some of the shareholders complain that owing to bad management the gold escapes. At Clunes, the Port Phillip Company have crushed, from 29th June to the 27th July, 2,292 tons of quartz, which yielded 1,649 oz. 4 dwt., or nearly J 4 dwt. 10 gr. per ton; the quantity is less than that crushed the former four weeks, owing to the Clunes Com pany sending down a larger quantity than usual of large quartz, which required to be calcined. At present the company is only able to burn about 30 tons daily, but their facilities for calcining the quartz will soon be increased by the addition of another large kiln now in course of erection; it is intended also to raise and re-lay the tramways from these kilns to the passes with iron rails, and to heighten the passes so as to afford capacity Towards the end of the month a new lead has been discovered, situated between Dia mond and Sulky gullies, which will I think run into the Bald Hills Lead ; it is called the Havilah Lead; the sinking is through 15 feet of common brown clay, then through 15 feet of sandy clay, then through 17 feet of drift, then through 10 feet of stiff greyish clay, Europeans.

The company, however, intend to carry this crosscut to their boun dary, to prove their claim, and if possible test the Western Reef. I have remarked that the Eastern Reef here underlays (east) at 45 de grees, which shows a great difference to the former mentioned company (their separate workings are not as yet united). From their shaft they have zinc pipes, 5 and 4 inches diameter, leading to the face of all their drives, through which air is forced by a large fanner by the engine.

The company have found it necessary, from symptoms of sinking from the surface, to secure the same by filling up the old workings ; for this purpose, they have put down a small shaft southward, and are now doing this with the accumulated tailings, which are deposited in the original bed of the creek. This shaft is also intended to facili tate the lowering of the massive timber re quired to secure the mine.

The new main shaft is down 150 feet It is 8 by 6 feet, and divided into three compartments \u2014 two of 3 feet square, for raising the metal, &c. ; the other 5 by 6 (less partitions) as the engine shaft. The poppet heads will be 50 feet high, and a tramway 300 feet long will be laid down to a level with the hoppers. This tramroad will be 30 feet above the surface the greater part of the distance. Railway iron will be used. This company has also found it requisite to secure their ground. They have sunk a shaft to the south to lower the heavy timber for the purpose; the timber i3 from 14 to 16 inches diameter at the smaller end, and about 30 feet long. These sole pieces will be placed 2J feet apart, and planked with 4-inch slabs, when the debris from the surface will be lowered to fill up the old workings. The Alliance Company have sunk a new shaft 82 feet on their northern boundary. In the crosscut, westward, they struck the Old Man Reef, 16 feet from the shaft, width 7 feet; at 52 feet struck Robinson's Reef; they are in 9 feet, and not through it. Eastward at 30 feet, the Eastern lode was cut ; this is 3 feet wide. It is not expected that either of these lodes have been cut before, either by the present or the former company who worked the claim. The stone raised is being roasted, prior to being tested in the mill. Alluvial Mining. \u2014 On this head but little can be noted.

The Birmingham Reef Prospect Company have crushed 14 tons of quartz, yielding 520 oz. per ton. The party south and the Union Company north have for the present sus pended operations. This ground appears an isolated point of a reef forced to the surface, which is broken to the south and on the east and west; the examination of the under ground workings, drawings of which I lately sent you, show that it is also broken to the north. A thorough search for the continu ance of such a vein cannot be undertaken by private enterprise. I have much pleasure in reporting to you this month the discovery of three new veins on this field, and which promise to yield very rich results; they are as follows: \u2014 No. 1.

The Sailors' Reef Company still continue their operations, and with the average results, 1 to 1J oz. per ton. The Wellington Reef prospect claim ob tained from their last crushing of 15 tons, 3J oz. per ton. The New Year's Reef prospect claim, from a crushing of 15 tons, obtained 11\u00a3 oz. per ton. The new vein I above referred to was found in sinking a deep shaft east to catch the dip of their original vein ; it will, in my opinion, yield 20 oz. per ton : they have already raised 8 tons of this vein. The Albion Company have struck the vein in their mine very rich, and there is no doubt but that good results will be obtained. The company has issued tenders for working and driving out large blocks of ground. A reef, north of ground lately occupied by Otway's crushing machine, has been taken up by a company of twelve men, occupying 600 by 500 feet ; it is their intention to work this thoroughly.

The supply of water has been decreasing considerably in consequence of the sine weather which has lasted since the beginning of J uue. ment to work this vigorously, if the water can be overcome. The proceedings of the past month have certainly given a favorable turn to the pro bable prospects of mining on Steiglitz : they are very flattering. The fact of three new veins being discovered, and rich ground opened in the Albion Company's mine, will, I have no doubt, give an impetus to the hitherto lethargic movements of the com panies on this field, and be the means of recal ling those of our mining population who have left for a time, and are awaiting some definite results from this field. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Wellington Reef, which was shut against individual enterprise for nearly twelve months, has under co-operative enterprise yielded, at the last crushing, \u00a38 per week per man. The quartz now being raised promises equal results. The Homeward Bound Reef's, the Inkermann's Reef's, the New Year's Reef's new vein have all been found by indi vidual enterprise. There are 41 puddling machines (horse). 4 whims (ditto). 290 sluices and toms. 33 water wheels. I have little to report this month on the alluvial diggings at Dolly's Creek, Tea-tree Creek, and Morrison's Diggings. Fresh claims have been taken up on the Tea-tree Creek, but none on the Moorabool or Dolly's Creek. The Tea-tree is assuming a very important appearance, and will, in all probability, prove very profitable to all parties engaged thereon. I have granted several protection registrations this month for that district (for one month), and I trust they may have the effect of deve loping what is, in my opinion, a most valuable auriferous tract of country. These water wheels are used exclusively for draining the claims. No increase in the extension of the lead in Bowman's Forest has taken place, and the number of failures below Number 10 has con siderably damped the ardor of the miners to discover its position. At Reid's Creek, and more especially at the Woolshed, the fineness of the weather has been in favor of the miners in decreasing the pressure of water upon their workings. At the El Dorado they are progressing rather slowly. Kneebone and Co.'s claim is paying the splendid returns that it has' always been doing. They have found a stone believed to be a diamond in their ground. More than one diamond has been already found upon the Woolshed Creek (of which the El Dorado is a continuation), and in all likelihood many will eventually be brought to light. The great difficulty of observing them while the soil is being sluiced prevents their being obtained in greater numbers. Wellington's party have bottomed on a solid reef of rock at a depth of 72 feet; it is a question with them whether to drive or Bink a new shaft will be the most economical.

I may mention that to my own knowledge one sluice head of clear water, and that but a small one, brings in a rental of j\u00a39 sterling per week. Hydraulic hoses are also em ployed in this division for gold washing, and sound to be a most expeditious method of getting away the dirt. The accompanying plan is of the Upper Three-mile Creek, which has been worked since 1852; it is now chiefly taken up by Chinese, who have thoroughly adopted the sluicing mode of operation. Up the side of the range, where they are driving, the tub and cradle are being used by some of the Chinese. In the Yackandandah Division, another of the extensive tailraces (mentioned in a for mer report), has been completed, and the owners have commenced washing, with every prospect of being amply remunerated for their two years of hard labor and heavy ex penses. The Pioneer Water Company have seven (7) heads of water rented from them by different parties, at a rental of (\u00a33) three pounds per head per week. No other work of importance has been completed or com menced, but the general body of miners, more particularly those at work from the township downwards, are doing well. Ten (10) claims have been taken up on the quartz reef, situ ated on the Clear Creek range, and which, since my last report, has been named the \" Comasino Reef.\" The width of the reef, in the prospectors' shaft, is over 4 feet 7 inches, with gold visible in the stone, as far as they have as yet got down. No crushing has been done. The want of a crushing machine is severely felt, there being none nearer than the Indigo, but it is to be hoped that this want will soon be supplied and the large re sources of this portion of the district thereby more fully developed.

From the other party I have not as yet heard anything. Mining operations have been actively car ried on in both the abovenamed divisions during the past month, raceholders and others making the best use of the supply caused by the rainfall of the previous month, but already a great number of parties are complaining of a scarcity of water, and unless we nave an unusually large fall of rain in the comings spring months but very little work can be done in these districts during the ensuing summer. Such a season as this brings forcibly into view the inestimable loss occasioned by not storing the large body of water falling in winter, which was not only allowed to run to waste, but also was the cause of an immense amount of injury being done.

The machinery is as follows : \u2014 the Junction Claim (next claim below the Nil Desperandum) no claim on this lead has struck the lead with certainty. The Union and Oriental claims have come upon gold which is sound to be payable, but the men consider they are not yet on the lead. I have measured off eight claims (amalga mated) below the Oriental, which takes the surveyed course of the lead into the Chiltern (proper) Township, near Dillon's public house; but of course the actual direction of the lead is very uncertain, as this patt of the country is a broad flat. Quartz. \u2014 Several new leaders are being prospected, and, as I shall be called upon in the course of a few weeks to register and survey all quartz claims, I expect to be in a position next month to report upon them more fully than I have hitherto been able to do. The crushing for the last month has not exceeded 91J tons, and the average produce has been 2 oz. to the ton. The crushing machinery erected on the Magenta Reef has been sold and taken to Morse's Creek. The cost of quartz crushing is from 20s. to 30s. a ton, according to agreement. The population is taken from the Police Returns. The population is fluctuating daily. Many of the men who have tried the Goulburn and Snowy River Diggings are returning daily. Several Government prospecting parties are trying the surrounding country, and from the unofficial reports which have reached mo I am in hopes of more than one new gold field being discovered. A party has just been in to report the discovery of a new lead in the Black Dog Forest, near the lowest dam on the private race which you will find on the Water Survey Plan. The reported depth of sinking is 41 feet, with about 12 inches of washdirt, which will probably run from 10 to 15 dwt. to the load. After months of persevering labor the claims on the Lower Indigo have been rewarded by finding the load. They are a little below Cornish Town to about the supposed junction with the Caledonian Lead, and the men report the prospects as very good; but in conse quence of the amalgamated claims (five or six claims together) being so large, it will be some time before I shall be enabled to forward a plan of them, as the lead will not be suf ficiently defined for some months to come. All the claims are wet, and the lowest one bottomed on the lead is 261 feet deep. Some portions of the Caledonian and Dur ham Leads were insufficiently tried by the first parties, and were prematurely abandoned in consequence of the patchiness of the ground. These parts have been taken up to be reworked, and some of the claims are paying the second occupants better than the first. The first lease under the new Order in Council has been taken up on the Suffolk Lead. It is for two acres, and is situated on the south-east side of the junction of the Suffolk and Glasgow Leads. The plans and report have been forwarded to the Warden. Buckland Division. The Kincardineshire Lead is, in some of the upper claims, still paying a good remunera tion to parties who have taken up extended claims. Nearly all the leads in this district (including the Main Indigo Lead) have proved patchy, and, consequently, old ground fre quently proved as good as new.

The reef under the alluvial workings on Maguire's Flat \u2014 [vide plan of district] \u2014 is also still being prospected, and a tunnel from the edge of the river, which is being driven in, is expected to strike the reef in a few weeks. The tunnel is through hard blue whinstone ; the specimens obtained from the surface of the reef are rich and the gold coarse, the quartz, however, is very white ; and I have observed that this kind of stone generally turns out the poorest on being crushed, while the mullocky and ferruginous quartz with fine gold is the richest. There has also been a promising quartz vein found in the eastern fork of the river and a short distance south of Clear Creek\u2014 [vide plan of division] \u2014 the surface quartz is much mixed with ironstone and shows a great deal of fine gold: there are on the surface three small leaders, all containing gold, and at a depth of about 15 feet they form into a reef about 18 inches wide. This part of the river has always been the most productive of specimens of quartz and gold. * This engine is being erected on the Ebenezer Reef (removed from the Buckland). In addition to the above machinery there are thirteen hydraulic sluices at work, in the Buckland River. The population throughout the district is settled. In the Ovens River portion of the division there is still very little doing in alluvial mining, there are only about 20 parties of Europeans at work and about 50 or 60 Chinese, and this number are generally only making small returns. The best claims are at a small rush there has lately been to Lyre-bird Creek or the western fork of the Ovens, and which is distant 20 miles from the Ovens Township. Here some parties have made good wages, two or three claims paying as much as \u00a320 per man per week ; there are not at present more than 38 Europeans and 40 Chinese on the ground, and the workings are at present con fined to the bed of the creek and a narrow flat adjacent. The depth of the ground averages about 15 feet, and the surface soil on the flat is black loam intermixed with waterworn gravel to a depth of 2 feet, underlying which is the auriferous drift consisting of very heavy waterworn gravel and sandstone boulders. The bed-rock is of soft yellow sandstone. The gold is coarse, the largest piece obtained was a nugget of 5 oz. 6 dwt., and it intermixed with quantities of quartz specimens ; there is, however, but little heavy quartz in the gravel. The out-cropping rocks in the neighborhood consist of slate and sandstone. There is at all times a plentiful supply of water in the creek for sluicing purposes. The ground is worked by paddocking and shovelling the washing stuff into the sluice boxes. There are several miles of country of a promising appearance, but at present the extreme wetness of the ground is a great obstacle to prospecting; long tail-races have to be cut, as on Morse's Creek. In reference to the Buckland River portion of the division, I have to report that there has been an improvement in the yield of several of the alluvial claims during the month. The weather has been generally fine, and the damage done by the floods of last month has been repaired. Many parties of Chinese are engaged in extensive sluicing operations, and a considerable number are also employed with Europeans. I believe that most of the sluicing claims, which are worked by Europeans are, on an average, paying \u00a36 per week per man, where water is obtained in sufficient quantity. Much anxiety is felt in the district with respect to the value of water right property, pending the settlement of the question of water rights and supply by the Government. On the reefs. \u2014 The Quartz Mining Company (Messrs. Morgan and Co., of the Nelson and Alia Reefs), have this month dissolved partner ship, and a new company, comprising two of the original shareholders and six new ones, has been formed. There has been some much better lookingquartz taken from the south-east end of the Nelson Claim since my last report, and the new company are now engaged in raising quartz from this reef and in erecting their water wheel. In the meantime they are having quartz crushed at Messrs. Askwith's (the Excelsior Company's) machine. They also state their intention of testing the Alia Reef further during the ensuing summer.

Many new claims have been taken up during the month, six of which are prospecting claims on new reefs, and are registered under the following names, viz.: \u2014 The Leviathan, the Three-mile Reef, the German Reef, the Ph\u0153nix Reef, Hampton Reef, and the Worcester Reef; most of them appear to be promising. The Durham Reef and three or four other small veins have been abandoned, principally for want of means to prospect them thoroughly. More machinery will soon be at work. Messrs. Mackay's engine is daily expected. Messrs. Stevens and Co., are also busily engaged in making preparations to ereet the mill they purchased at the Indigo. Messrs. Gitchell and Chalmers are also about putting up an efficient machine on Richardson's Reef, and Messrs. Pascoe and Co. of the Oriental, contemplate erecting a powerful mill on Morse's Creek. Messrs. Rossiter and Wallace's (Enterprise Company) water-power machine is working most satis factorily ; the wheel is 24 feet in diameter, and drives a battery of four dry stampers and two pairs of large Chillian wheels; the ex penditure of water is 99 inches with a pressure of 6 inches above the centre of the fall. Unfortunately the water mill at Richardson's Reef has proved a complete failure. are still prospecting but have not had crushing. Gander's Reef. \u2014 During the month the principal work on these claims has been securing and timbering the ground. I have not been able to ascertain the yield of what quartz has been crushed, but, judging from its appearance at the shaft, I believe the yield continues as good as at first. No party, except in the two amalgamated claims, has yet struck the reef. On the Elgin Reef, Messrs. Falconer and Co. are working the cap of the reef in the prospecting claim, which I am informed will yield about 1 oz. to the ton. All the quartz from the proper reef has been raised, and Stevens and Co.'s claim is registered until the surface water abates. No. 1 North and No. 2 South are also registered for the same pur pose. On Richardson's Reef the prospectors have had a crushing of eight tons at the mill they had erected, but in consequence of the im perfect working of the machine, which lost a large quantity of quicksilver, it is probable that the yield, (4 oz. per ton), is far short of the actual value of the quartz, which was also from the worst quartz they have raised. The prospecting claim is now being opened on the length of the reef, and the quartz is stated to continue to look as well as in the shafts. No. 1 North have now struck a pro mising reef, but not so large as in Richardson's claim. No. 5 South have also struck the reef, which is about a foot thick, and also looks well. The intermediate parties and No. 2 North have not yet come on the reef. On the Oriental Reef a considerable quantity of quartz has been crushed during the month ; all the tramways are in good working order, and the quartz is payable throughout. I am informed that the prospecting claim has averaged about 2 oz. per ton ; No. 1 South, 3 oz. ; No. 2 South, 2 and 1 J oz. per ton. The yield from the northern portion of the pros pecting claim, (or No. 1 North); I have not been able to ascertain, but believe it is more patchy than the other claims ; some of the quartz looks poor, and in some a considerable quantity of gold is visible. In the tunnel at the head of Rossiter's tramway, the reef is fifteen feet in thickness, with gold throughout. Three additional claims have been taken up by Messrs. Wallace and Co., who intend to apply for a lease of their ground, should the reef be struck in claims 2 and 3 North ; tunnels are being driven for the purpose of ascertain ing the position of the reef. Nos. 3, 4, and 5 South are still being prospected and another bas been taken up. From the Buckeye Reef a small parcel of 5 cwt. has been crushed at Gitchell's machine, and yielded 11 oz. There are three other claims prospecting. On the Ebenezer Reef, all the parties are engaged in removing the engine from the Buckland, and in making preparations to place it on the reef, consequently little or nothing has been done on the claims. The Hampton Reef is at present only a vein of about seven inches thick ; but a parcel of 5 tons, the entire bulk of the vein, yielded 19 oz. 5 dwt. to the ton. No. 1 North have also struck a small leader, in which they have seen gold. No. 1 South is tunnelling. In No. 2 South there is a vein ten inches wide, but no gold has yet been seen.

The other claims"], [363, "MINING SUBVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 JULY. 177 The latter are sinking, and are daily ex pecting to strike the main reef, as they have still the pipe-clay casing containing loose quartz and gold. There are several hundred tons of surface stone in this claim. The other party, No. 1 North, are also sinking. On the Union Reef the prospectors have run out the auriferous leader they were sinking on, and are now prospecting a large reef which runs through their claim, and which was supposed, to be barren ; they have, how ever, seen a little gold in the stone, which has otherwise a promising appearance. Of Falconer's Reef there is little to report. Scarcely any work has been done in the piospectors' claim, which does not look so well as Nos. 1 and 2 South, which have shafts down 40 and 60 feet. This reef is now only a small one. A tramway is being made to the reef. The principal reefs, which I have numbered, are as follows : \u2014 marked and The Hibernian Reef appears to give en couraging prospects. It consists of two leaders, running close together, and inclining to each other; both are gold bearing. A third share has changed hands for \u00a395. The Victoria Reef is still prospecting. On the Woolshed Reef several hundred tons of quartz on the prospecting claim await the erection of machinery on the Ovens River. This party have lately struck another larger reef, the one they were working proving to be only the cap ; it appears fully as rich as on the surface. No. 1 North have also a good reef, but much smaller than on the prospecting claim. Nos. 1 and 2 South have been amal gamated, and a tunnel is now being driven to prove the reef. The West Briton and Cornishman's Reefs are also yielding large quantities of fine looking stone, likewise awaiting machinery. SANDHURST MINING DISTRICT. Eaglehawk Division. (G. W. Hart, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Rose of Australia Reef, which is situ ated to the west of the Lyre-bird Creek, is also looking well ; it is about two feet in thickness, with gold throughout the stone. There is no other claim but the prospectors' working at present. They are about erecting a water- power machine for their claim. Some fine specimens have been found some distance to the southward of this reef, but the snow on the ranges prevents prospecting at present. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Lisbon, Australasia, McAlpines, De vonshire, Caledonian, William Tell, and White Star Reefs, are also looking well on the sur face, but so little work has been done as yet, that there is nothing further to report re specting them. Prospecting is also being carried on in most of the other reefs I have enumerated, but amongst so many there are, no doubt, several that will not prove remu nerative. 1 have the honor to forward this month a general plan of the Buckland Division. _ 2 same. so. )riental \u00c6ead's Slander's Slgin Richardson's Buckeye ibenezer Welcome falconer's flibernian Woolshed West Britain Uornishman's Rose of Australia ... vMetoria Lisbon Hampton Australasia Pioneer White Star Worcester ...

The digging in this locality is entirely confined to the creeks, the country being so precipitous that scarcely any flat ground exists, and what little there is will not pay for working, the whole of the gold being found in the beds of the water courses, and wherever a bar of slate strikes across the creek. Considerable trouble and expense has to be undergone in turning the creeks, cutting races, making sluice boxes, &c, and this fact alone has driven mrny away, from the want of means to bear the necessary expense. From reliable authority I learn that about one pound (\u00a31) per man per day may be considered as near the best average results obtained, and this clear of all expenses and delay. The best route from Kilmore is to Yea, 37 miles; thence across the Muddy Creek to Close's Station, 10 miles ; from there to Glass's, 3 miles ; from Glass's to Conolly's, 9 miles.

The population is as follows :\u2014 Europeans. Alluvial miners 520 Quartz miners 960 1480 The machinery is as follows: \u2014 A considerable number of miners have returned to Reedy Creek, and many of the reefs now idle will doubtless soon be again at work ; a rich vein of quartz has been struck on Landgridge's Hill, and the alluvial ground on the creek still gives payable results. On the King Parrot the principal work being done is for the reception of machinery, in order to work the reefs there on a larger scale ; and I trust, in the course of next mouth, to be able to report a change for the better on this field. At Muddy Creek (Tea), the reefs are still looking well, the Carriers' Reefs yielding from 7 to 8 oz. to the ton of quartz, and the new reef \" McLash's,\" which I mentioned in my last report, has yielded nearly 4 oz. to the ton, with a large body of stone. A very rich looking vein of quartz has been struck at the Tea-tree, but as no crushing has yet taken place, it is impossible to estimate what the yield is likely to be. The Enniskillen, Dunrobin, and Joiners' Reefs still promise well, and from the fact of numerous parties being out prospecting, near this locality, I have every expectation of new reefs being shortly discovered. The principal event in my division in mining matters during the past month is the rush to Gafney's Creek, about 400 men have passed through Yea, en route for the new diggings, by far the greatest proportion of whom have returned, some with the intention of revisiting the field with pack horses, stores, &c, &c. A large number, however, never reached the diggings, having discovered that all provisions had to be packed a distance Note. \u2014 My information relative to Gafney's Creek is not the result of my own personal observation as I have been unable to proceed there at present, but I put every confidence in the parties from whom I received it, they having just returned from there, and being most respectable parties.

The machinery is as follows: \u2014 \u25a0 Several other shallow workings upon adja cent hills, and in many of the neighboring gullies, are being prosecuted ; but, from what 1 can ascertain, are only attended with wages results. The population at Lamplough is rather on the increase, principally from Ingle wood. A new rush occurred a few days ago about eight miles from Lamplough, on the Lexton road ; but in the absence of any payable grouud (except the prospectors) having been discovered, it has nearly subsided again. Amphitheatre and Mountain Hut. \u2014 A rush to the former place is again talked of, whilst at the latter, I am credibly informed, a very payable quartz vein, situate upon a spur of the Pyrenees, has been opened. A share in one of the claims was sold last week for \u00a340, I have not visited these workings ; but, iu the event of their becoming important, shall do so, and furnish more detailed information in my next report. On the Avoca Main Lead I have no change whatever to report. The Lamplough Deep Lead is steadily pro gressing. A plan of which, with vertical sections of strata to the auriferous drift, I beg to transmit. No. 1 Section (see plan) is nearly at the head of the workings, where also a junction with the middle or second lead discovered is now formed and being worked ; the yield per load averaging one oz., with eighteen inches thickness of wash-dirt ; the schist formation principally composed of soft white slate. At St. Arnaud new quartz veins of a pay able character are frequently being discovered, but the thickness (in most cases) being only a few inches, my impression is, that in order to find a main thick payable reef, a consider. able depth will have to be sunk, which can only be attained by having efficient steam machinery for that purpose. No. 2 Section. \u2014 The workings are a fac simile of No. 1, except in the strata to the bed rock. At Four-mile Flat the miners are all doing remarkably well. Several rich claims are being worked ; and I am surprised this gold field (which indicates an extensive one) does not command more attention from the miners. Within the last few days several nuggets, varying from seventy-four to five ounces each, have been taken out. This lead, unlike most of the alluvial workings in this district, as it progresses down the flat into deeper ground, instead of becoming poorer, has, on the con trary with the distance, increased considerably in value; and most unquestionably several pile claims are now being worked. No. 3 Section is the deepest working upon the lead, and it is admitted generally that near this point a lead of gold diverges from these workings to the north into yet deeper and wet grouud. '1 he strata in this section to the auriferous drift differs materially from the others, which somewhat justifies the assumption of there being a contiguous sepa rate lead, whilst in the centre of the wash dirt is found a conglomerate of gravel six inches thick, containing gold payable for crushing, the result being an ounce to the ton. Average yield of the wash-dirt, which is one foot thick, one ounce per load. The break between the twa workings (as shown in my plan of last month) is now con nected, and paying well; and although the progress of this working further down the flat is at present at a stand, it may be attri buted to the fact that those who presume to know its whereabouts are already remunera tively engaged further up the lead. Yet the continuation of this flat for several miles, which eventually connects itself with the Avoca River (being all virgin ground), I am convinced that, ere long, another large rush to this place will be the result. No. 4 Section is the last hole bottomed upon gold. At this point the lead is very contracted, having recently been found again between two holes which had been sunk for some time past in adjoining claims, and the lead of gold, yet avoiding the deep ground, adhering closely to the Southern Keef, and which also has diverged (seeplan) in a semi circular form from its original course.

Claim No. 2 is as yet working deeper and not so wide, crushing the whole mass which yields from 5 dwts. to 1 oz. per ton. Claim No. 3 is working another body parallel with but lying to the eastward of the reef in Nos. 1 and 2, and obtains good prospects. Other claims on either side are opening continua tions of the same reef with every inducement to success. A considerable quantity of alluvial ground has been opened at Campbell's Creek and Guildford. A rush at the top of Specimen Flat and immediately adjoining the northern boundary of the Cumberland Reef Mining Company's Reef, and running up to said reef, is yielding I oz. to the tub, but the ground here is limited in extent. Another and much larger area known as Taylor's Paddock, which I have frequently recommended to be worked is now being prospected, and in some claims very success fully. The local papers lately reported another matrix of the precious metal as having been discovered in a grey stone rock, found on the Monk's Hill at a depth of 150 feet, but on inspecting the supposed discovery I found it to be a mistake, the metal being pyrites resembling gold. In several places continuations of old workings and patches of surface ground on sides of ranges and quartz reefs are affording employment on the old tub and cradle system. But the greatest and most successful rush is in private property at Guildford, almost exclusively of Chinese, who are evincing far more enterprise, and entering into more speculations than the European miners, by purchasing permission to mine large cul tivated paddocks, paying a large bonus for so doing, and agreeing to replace the surface soil as they find it. Several pieces of land have been thus taken up. For a paddock of Mr. Taylor's, \u00a31000 was agreed ; one-third paid before turning the first sod, already the second instalment has been realized from the ground and paid, and the remainder is to be paid within one month. The like privilege of abstracting the gold from a second paddock has been agreed to for \u00a31100, while other and neighboring landowners give the necessary permission for \u00a34 to \u00a36 per claim of 40 x 40 feet. A prospecting association has been estab lished in Castlemaine under very favorable auspices, the object being to prospect the innumerable untried gullies and flats within a radius of fifteen to twenty miles of Castle maine. A considerable sum has been raised by subscription, which is to bo supplemented by a grant from Government. I have to report a very encouraging im provement in the operations of our mining companies ; those companies which have commenced crushing are not only paying expenses, but in some instances declaring and paying dividends out of the bond fide proceeds, which are confidently believed to be the precursors and commencement of a long and successful series of operations, and as the mines become properly developed, and improved processes for saving the finer particles of gold introduced, this division will regain its former position as a gold-producing district. A new matrix of the precious metal has been discovered situate, as the accompanying tracing will show, in Wattle Gully, Forest Creek, it being a massive sandstone reef per meated with fine veins of ironstone, and facings of said veins and also the blocks of solid stone, are largely impregnated with fine gold ; the reef crops out in or near the surface as an ordinary sandstone reef, bearing north and south with a slight underlay to the west. It was originally discovered by Pryor's dig ging in his garden, he was led to sink deeper, aud from his first prospect of 2 tons, crushed by Chilian rollers, 11\u00a3 oz. 2 *iwt. was obtained; and his last crushing by the stamping process 9 tons yielded 31 oz. 16 dwt., but it was believed much of the gold was lost, the stone being so easily disinte grated as to render it almost impossible to bring the fine gold in contact with the mer cury by the process of stamps and tables, therefore the Chilian basin would be far preferable, but no such apparatus remains in The Nuggety Reef Company \u2014 have pur chased a fine engine of thirty horse-power, with stamping, winding, and pumping ma chinery, and are busily employed in erecting it on the reef; the plant will be very com plete and will enable the claimholders to compete with the immense current of water which has hitherto so retarded their opera tions, and to work the reef to the best possible advantage. The splendid plant belonging to the Old Quartz Hill Company is erected, and is the most substantial and powerful I have seen in the colony ; the company are extending their operations, and increasing their chances of success by a second lease containing a strong auriferous lode, and also by occupying and working claims on the Little Quartz or"], [371, "MINING SUBVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 JULY. 185 Scotchman's Hill; the machinery being well situate, and capable of crushing from each reef, and will give a great impetus to quartz mining in its locality. to 12s. 6d.; other mill owners have given up crushing for the public, averring the above prices unpayable, but the powerful machinery now being brought into use will be able to crush profitably at such prices, and will give a very great impetus to quartz mining operations. The Cumberland Reef Company have so far completed the erection of their machinery as to be able to commence crushing opera tions with eight stamps. They have three reefs within their claim ; the one they are at present working varies from 6 to 12 feet in width, and is calculated to average 7 dwt. per ton; their supply of water is from their main shaft, it at present is 160 feet, the sinking being through soft blue slate ; the supply of water is expected to be ample for their requirements when sufficiently deep to cut the quartz reefs.

A few practical miners, believing in its auriferous character, subscribed and worked the ground, and formed themselves into a company liable to \u00a310 per share, \u00a33 of which was paid as a first instalment; with this capital they executed the lease, and commenced operations, the first 30 tons yield ing 69 oz., out of which they returned the capital subscribed in the form of a dividend ; they have since raised a quantity which has yielded over 6 oz. per ton, and are very con fident of a continuation of success. The Eureka Reef Company having been very dissatisfied with the yield of gold obtained by their new machinery having the Clunes system of amalgamation, are insti- tuting inquiries and experiments with the view of testing the tailings and reef; there is every probability of the company succeed- ing well when some better system for saving the gold is adopted, as since their partial stoppage they have been raising quartz yielding 1 oz. per ton, and they possess im- mense bodies and veins of quartz, many of which are proved gold bearing, and one simply prospected. In submitting to the Board of Science my first report, 1 may state that having only taken office on the 6th of July last, I am not in a position to give so full a report as I shall in future be enabled to do; neither shall I, for the same reason, comply this month with the other requests contained in the instructions, respecting the furnishing of plans of gullies, reefs, &c.

Sluicing. \u2014 Around the Loddon parties are actively engaged ; with what result I am unable to ascertain, as the miners are princi pally Chinese. Betwixt Pennyweight and Guildford there has been an influx of some 500 Celestials, who have purchased the ground on the banks of the Loddon for high prices. In some instances proprietors making a good market of their allotments. In reporting on the division, I shall com mence with the \u2014 Alluvial Workings. \u2014 Puddling. \u2014 This branch of mining is very considerably carried out in this district, and on the whole I believe the puddlers are averaging fair wages. Gol den and Spring gullies appear at present to be the favored localities, theie being scarcely a foot of ground in those places unoccupied. From the junction of Fryer's Creek proper with Spring Gully, at Church's Flat, along Horseshoe Bend, by Chapel Hill, through Chokem and New Year's Flats, to the junction of Fryer's Creek with the Loddon, the pud dlers are busily at work. Tub and Cradle Working. \u2014 These imple ments of mining are almost obsolete, as it is impossible as a rule for miners to earn any thing like wages by washing poor stuff in this manner. Quartz Mining. \u2014 Perhaps in no mining dis trict in the colony is this branch of mining so dull, or so little carried out as in this. Tunnelling. \u2014 The Basaltic Hills around the Loddon, near the hamlets of Vaughan, Kan garoo, and Pennyweight, are the favorite lo calities for tunnelling. On Table Hill espe cially, the miners are averaging over first-class wages, some clearing from \u00a325 to \u00a330 per week per man. On the El Dorado only a few parties are at work. The Emu, Perron's, Mopoke, and Blacksmith's Gully Reefs are also in the same state. The Cornish and Spanish is the only reef at present paying extra wages. The depth of the Table Hill in the deep lead is 130 feet (I will give you plans and sections of this hill at my earliest opportunity). There has been a second lead discovered lately, which bids far to eclipse the old one, as much as 20 oz. to the load is being washed from some of the claims at this time. Companies. \u2014 El Dorado. \u2014 This company have one of the largest reefs in the colony to operate on, and it seems they intend working it in a systematic manner, from the style in which they are erecting their machinery and preparing for work. They hare, in addition to an eight horse-power engine, purchased of the claimholders a sixty horse-power vertical engine, to which they are attaching a battery of twenty-four head of stampers. They have also constructed two splendid reservoirs, to collect storm water, as they will have to sink at least 350 feet to get a supply of the limpid element from the lode. The whole is being carried out in a substantial manner. (I shall report more fully on this company and reef next month). The other hills being tunnelled are the Bald Hill, Sailor's Hill, and Kangaroo Hill. These are not so productive as Table Hill, but the miners average fair wages. It may safely be stated that the tunnellers of the Fryer's Creek District are in as good a position as those in any part of the colony. Before leaving this branch of mining it may be useful to state that in tracing on surface the line of a tunnel I had surveyed,* I found on fixing the theodolite (improved miner's dial) on the brow of the hill where the rock crops out, 1 found a variation of 2\u00b0 10' W. in the needle ; I discovered it in the following manner \u2014 I took a sight iu going up the side of the hill to the spot above named, and on reaching that spot I (as I invariably do in these kind of surveys) took a proof sight back to my former station, and found the vari ation mentioned ; in order to make assurance doubly sure, I went over the same ground three times with the same result. Immedi ately I reached the top of the hill (covered Emu Company. \u2014 This is in statu quo for want of funds. They have a large strong lode to operate on, but in their part of the reef they have not as yet sunk sufficiently deep to strike the shoots of gold, which have been very productive in the adjoining claims. Ferron's Reef Company. \u2014 This company is also doing nothing, pending the settlement of a law suit in the Court of Mines between the former claimholders and present proprietors. I believe they have good prospects, if properly managed. Chapel Hill Company. \u2014 This has failed, as any intelligent miner might have predicted. They started to work on a series of leaders, \u2022 On Table Hill."], [373, "MINING SUBVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 JULY. 187 without searching for the main lode (if there be one in the vicinity), and as a matter of course came to a standstill immediately the leaders were exhausted. The machinery is as follows Alliance Company. \u2014 This, from what 1 am enabled to gather, is likely to prove produc tive ; but time will show. Alliance Companies. \u2014 These, without ex ception, have come to a standstill, whether worked by working shareholders or mining adventurers. The Old Pennyweight Hill, Strathloddon, Windlass Hill, and even the Ballaarat Com pany, are defunct, the latter's plant having been sold off some weeks since. The Sludge. \u2014 After close observation and careful study on this subject, I have come to the conclusion that there is only one way of getting rid of this great nuisance, and that way is, by having a good supply of water where the nuisance prevails. I have ob served that where the sludge can be kept running, it clears itself, i.e., finds its way to its natural destination, the river ; but where there is a scarcity of water, the little of that element contained in the sludge evaporates, and leaves the mud behind. The following applications, as under, have been made during the month of July. Dams and puddling machines (2). \u2014 At Sandy and Bradford Creeks. Registration. \u2014 Fourteen cases. Protection to water-holes for domestic pur poses (1).\u2014 At Eaglehawk Creek. Amalgamation (5).\u2014 At the following places: German Reef, 800 feet; Dun's Reef, Sandy Creek, 1,600 feet; Bell's Reef, 160 feet; Tiverton Reef, 465 feet. I would therefore suggest that the main sludge channels should have a small stream of water constantly running through them. This I believe will be more useful than all the manual labor that could be brought to bear on those channels. Abandoned Reefs (6).\u2014 In all cases 320 feet granted at Kangaroo and Dun's Reefs. Areas of ground for machinery (1). \u2014 For la. 2r. 28p. area at Long Gully. Prospecting Claims (1). \u2014 Two hundred and forty feet on a reef unnamed. If it were only for this alone, it would be advisable to construct the proposed reservoirs in the various districts. In mining matters I have nothing new to chronicle this month. The great absence of rain during the pre ceding month, has very much curtailed the amount of water in the division. Maldon Division, The number of crushing engines now at work and more erecting, all of them of con siderable horse-power, require a constant supply of the purest water for mining pur suits.

On most of the old discovered reefs in Jim Crow, one or two claims are being worked, and about J to 1J oz. per ton may be taken as the average produce. That in consequence the extent of payable ground appears so limited, is, however, ac counted for when it is taken into consideration that a claim being taken up at present is an old worked reef 320 feet, and on a new reef 120 feet along the course of the reef, and it therefore follows that where in times bygone five or six claims would be payable there is now only one; and the strike of the reefs is generally so great that 400 or 500 feet from where gold is struck on the top the depth of sinking for the reef becomes so difficult and expensive an undertaking that success not only depends upon practical ability, but also upon having at command the necessary capital for carrying out in a systematic manner the im provements taught by experience. (Amb. Johnson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 The machinery is as follows : \u2014 In the southern part of the division, or Jim Crow Proper, on Emu Reef, four 320 feet claims have been taken up by a stroDg party from Ballaarat. It is commonly reported that some first-rate quartz has been raised on the said reef, but the character of the lode being very patchy, and the quantity of water to be contended with at last too heavy to be overcome with ordinary appliances, it was ultimately abandoned, and had now been deserted for a couple of years ; the present owners of the ground seem, however, to have great faith iu the undertaking, and are prepared, if necessary, to erect sufficient ma chinery on the ground, and I am persuaded that with due skill and economy the under taking will prove very remunerative. On Adams Reef, one 320 feet claim \u2014 within the boundaries of the lease applied for by Messrs. Doney and Co., occupied in virtue of miners' rights at the time said application was made, aud subsequently abandoned \u2014 has likewise been taken up, and I trust ere long to be put in a position to report these two reefs progressing favorably. The population has not during the month undergone any visible change, and I believe that the Snowy River is begining to lose its attraction in the eyes of the majority. I have personally visited the various localities in my division lately and the number of miners, given above, has been estimated on the spot. During the past month no new ground has been opened in my division, and no marked improvement can therefore be said to have taken place, but even as matters stand, judg ing by the contented look of the population, mining affairs in general seem to be quite satisfactory. Quartz Mining. \u2014 The chief improvement noticeable in my division since my last report is in quartz mining, which branch of industry On Nuggety Reef, Connell's Gully, some of the claims are still turning out first rate ; and the Welcome Reef Company's machine, erected in the immediate vicinity, having now commenced operations, will greatly facilitate quartz mining in the neighborhood. From Beehive Reef Dry Diggings, I have not heard of any crushing during the month, but am informed that the reef is still looking capital.

Operations have only just been commenced, but there is every reason to believe that a rich reef exists somewhere in the immediate neighborhood. of water, and the few working arc Wombat Reef, Parker's Specimen Reef, &c, have not, as far as I can learn, produced any remarkably rich crushings, $ to l\u00a3 oz. per ton being the average. About Yandoit, reefing is every day getting brisker, and the subjoined extracts from the books of the results of the various crushings at the local crushing machines, will serve to give a pretty correct general idea of the value of the different reefs. Puddling and Sluicing. \u2014 With the excep tion of a very few claims, the water supply during the month has been sufficient, and the produce, on the whole, satisfactory. In these branches of mining no important change is likely to occur, unless a considerable extent of new ground be opened; and although I have no doubt that such exists, still the population is far too settled to be expected to prospect for new ground as long as a com fortable living can be earned in the old dig gings. Messrs. Wardle and Co.'s race from Kangaroo Creek to Connell's Gully, mentiongd in my last report, has for some time been finished, but being newly cut, the water is absorbed before reaching its destination. A number of applications for water have been made to the owners, who consider the absence of water damaging them to an amount of about \u00a350 per week. It is, however, expected that the first shower will flush's, and Connell's Gully and vicinity will then put in a far busier appearance than for some time has been the case. From Ballaarat, Tarrangower, and sur rounding diggings, parties are daily coming over to look for reefs ; and I expect shortly to see Yandoit fully as lively as when the lead through Mr. Morrison's paddocks were working. Crushings at the Yandoit and Franklin ford Quartz Crushing Machines : \u2014 Tunnelling is a branch of mining that, for regularity of yield, and the length of time employment generally is afforded, fully equals puddling and sluicing ; but it must at the same time be borne in mind, that sometimes the labor of years is required to cut the tunnel into the gutter, but that first reached, remu nerative employment for years is generally secured. All our principal basaltic bills are at present in full work, and the large heaps of stuff stacked during the last summer are fast disappearing ; and although it is very difficult to obtain any reliable information res pecting the yield, still, judging by appear ances, I almost consider tunnelling the most profitable branch of alluvial mining on Jim Crow. During the month of July the following new reefs have been discovered : \u2014 Glamorganshire Reef, Forty-foot. \u2014 In the prospecting claim a very promising leader has been struck at a depth of about 30 feet, and a few more claims have in consequence been taken up. No crushing has, however, as yet taken place, but the reef appears to be a southern continuation of the celebrated Ham burg Reef (where it is reported one -fourth share was the other day sold at \u00a31700), and the claimholders are very sanguine as to their ultimate success. Ballaarat Reef, head of Forty-foot. \u2014 Spe cimens are said to have been found on the hil], Alluvial Sinking. \u2014 The principal, and I may say the only, localities for tub and cradle work, are Boots and Yandoit and surrounding gullies ; and in both places, with tbe excep tion of some instances of extraordinary good luck to individuals, nothing especially worthy of remark has occurred during July. One nugget of 16 oz. in Boots, and several pretty heavy ones in New Nuggety Gully, have been discovered ; but the greater majority of the population are just making a living, all, however, expecting some day to come across some good-sized lump of the precious metal, Proprietors.

The population is as follows : \u2014 Accompanying, I have the honor to submit to your Honorable Board geological plans No. 9 and 10, being southern continuations of those transmitted the preceding month, and beg to refer you to the following explanation. The alluvial gold workings within these plans are limited to one patch of ground near the Burnt Swamp, occupied by two parties, who have cut races from the head of said swamp and Splitters' Creek, for the purpose of effectually working the ground, and I am informed, that for a couple of years the claims have paid very good wages, as long as a sufficient water supply was available, nuggets of 1 or 2 oz. being turned up oc casionally. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 At Splitters' Creek and the different swamps, as also on several hills in the vicinity, payable sluicing prospects have been obtained ; but the limited supply of water that can be depended upon for any period of time i3 already granted to various parties, and besides this, some of the ground is so high, that the only means of getting water at a sufficient elevation, would be constructing reservoirs at the foot of the dividing range, not only expensive, hut also in diminishing the water shed to a certain extent interfering with existing privileges. This locality has not, however, had half the attention it, in my opinion deserves, and I am pretty confident, that in a few seasons more, if not before, the ground will be thoroughly prospected, and if no leads are found, at least patches of good payable ground will be discovered. The discovery of an auriferous gully about a mile to the eastward of the township, and which I mentioned in my last report, has been the chief field of operation during the month of July. About 300 miners had congre gated there at one time. The worked part of the gully, which runs north and south, extends perhaps half a mile, its width iu no part exceeding the extent of three claims.

Quartzoze drift, which is so commonly found at the bottom of alluvial deposits yielding gold, is almost wanting in this gully. The bed-rock is sandstone, with a non-auriferous quartz vein crossing the southern end of the gully.

Some are still engaged in the township and its suburbs, where they usually sink shafts in new ground. An auriferous quartz reef has been dis covered a quarter of a mile eastward of, and running parallel to, this Victoria Gully. The rightful ownership to the prospectors' claim is the subject of litigation. Humboldt Reef. \u2014 The company on the prospectors' claim is doing well, but they havo not had any quartz crushed during this month. Two other claims which had gold, but in small quantities, have been temporarily relinquished for want of funds. Specimens of quartz-hearing gold were found on the surface scattered 300 or 400 yards from the out-cropping reef. Bell-topper Hill Reef.\u2014 M. Berges and Co. have got up a six horse-power engine, but havo had no returns as yet. Three shafts are being worked on the reef. The usual yield exceeds an ounce of gold from a ton of stone. This reef is only 10 inches thick and dips to the eastward at an angle of 22^ degrees from the perpendicular. A second auriferous reef has since been dis covered near the first, running at right angles to it, i.e., bearing east and west. This one is much the larger of the two, being about 2 feet thick. Malmsbury Diggings. \u2014 Messrs. Gateshill and Co. have applied for a lease of 10 acres more ground, they have wrought out a privi lege of 4 acres, their mode of operation being tunnelling under a high bank of diluvial form ation and puddling the auriferous drift through a horse machine.

Russell and Co. are trying a quartz reef on Mr. Jefferson's land, crushing the stone by a water-power mill. Taradale, to the westward of the Coliban River. \u2014 The quartz reef known as the Castle Rock is again being tried. It was once aban doned, but a company has applied for a lease of 9 acres of ground there. Both the above operations are carried on on the Coliban River, about 3 miles south of Malmsbury. Some two years since six tunnels were driven into the hills along the Back Creek Valley between the township and Yankee Point, but abandoned. They are again at tracting notice; operations have been re commenced at one, at Yankee Point, and another close to the township is about to be reopened. A conviction is ever recurring to the miners that rich deposits of gold exist under the trap rock, of which these hills are composed. Barfold Ranges. \u2014 There are 10 shafts work ing on the different reefs, several claims have been temporarily relinquished for want of funds, the yields not paying expenses. A breakage of machinery stopped the crushing operations, only 20 tons were reduced during July, which yielded 27 ounces. The returns of crushings for last month came to hand too late for insertion : they were, for the month of June, 157 oz. 15 dwt. of gold, from 244J tons of quartz.

There is also a great inclination exhibited to work the reefs of this part of the division by small local companies, which, I consider, admirably suited to existing circumstances. (James Murphy, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows One of these companies has just been estab lished on the cost-book system, under the name of the You You Hill Mining Company, and it is expected that mining operations will be commenced, within the current month. Mining operations of rather an extensive character are being carried on, at the You You Hill, by Messrs. Shotton and party, who are driving a tunnel for the purpose of cutting all the reefs that are known to exist in this hill. They have already driven to a distance of 80 feet, about two-thirds of which was through clay, and the remainder through a very rubbly soft brown micaceous sand stone. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 They propose driving to a distance of 1350 feet, which will take them quite through the hill, and fully effect the purpose they have in view, namely, to intersect all the reefs that are known to exist in that immediate locality. The mode of timbering adopted, is that known as single collar, with a lagging of slabs on the top and sides. The tramway, or rather railway is formed of flat bar iron of 2 in. by -^ scantling, set on edge and wedged into transverse sleepers. This is found to be much cheaper than wooden trams, sufficiently strong for the purpose, and of course more durable. The average yield of the quartz crushed on the Caledonia Gold Field, during the month of July, was four ounces to the ton. One lot of 5 tons from Oram's Reef yielded 12 oz. per ton. Although there is an increase in the num ber of alluvial miners on the Caledonian Gold Field, it is not due to an increased yield of gold from that class of mining, as there is fully one-fourth of the alluvial miners not earning a living. They will continue working on old and worked-out ground, with all the chances against them, while there are hun dreds of gullies, with all the indications of being highly auriferous, not even prospected yet. I have the honor to inform you, that during the month of July, nothing of strik ing importance has occurred within this division. There is a steady increase in the number of Europeans employed, in both quartz and alluvial mining ; and a slight decrease in the number of Chinese. This decrease in the number of Chinese indicates that the old ground is becoming worked out. The Chinese here, never prospect new ground.

Sago Hill. \u2014 The miners in this locality continue to work with ordinary energy on that portion of the bill where the deep ground has been discovered, and, in many instances, are reaping a rich reward for their labors : one claim has, for some time past, been yield ing from \u00a330 to \u00a340 per man per week under the most primitive mode of working; but the operations of those parties *vho have been sinking ahead in search of the deep ground are beginning somewhat to flag.

The gully generally presents a very satisfactory appearance. Milkmaid's Lead. \u2014 The Burra Burra Com pany have worked out the greater portion of their alluvial ground, which still continues to yield good returns, and are commencing to turn their attention to the quartz reef which passes through their claim, and which has proved, so far as it has been tested, to be a very rich and very extensive reef.

The Allied Armies, Ophir, and Independent Companies, are engaged in blocking out. The Great Republic Company have been again swamped out, the water from the rock having burst in upon them, in consequence of which the Catch-me-who-can shaft, which has been used for draining the lead, has for the present been rendered useless.

Frenchman's. \u2014 The Albion Company is still driving for, but have not yet struck, the deep ground ; still from indications at present discernible they are led to believe that the gutter is near at hand, as the reef is soit and quartz gravel is found in the ridges. The Hand-in-Hand Company and the Royal Saxon Company are prosecuting their works with moderate success. The Leviathan Company has discontinued its operations in consequence of the gutter having been proved to be outside of the paddock in which they were mining. The Southern Cross Company is still sinking, and it is anticipated that they will discover the gutter at no great distance from their shaft. The Tannery Company is still driving for, but has not yet struck, the gutter. Swamp Lead. \u2014 I forward herewith a detail plan and section of the Essex Company's workings. This company commenced mining operations nearly two and a half years since ; they have sunk three shafts, in which they had to sink through about 230 feet of basaltic rock which required blasting, besides clay and drifts, making in all a total of 350 feet in depth. The company has recently secured a paddock adjoining their claim, and, as will be seen from the plan, the gutter is within this private property; so that, bad they not suc ceeded in getting the paddock, all their labor aud capital would have been lost; as it is, judging from the prospects obtained, there is reason to believe that they will be well re munerated. The Black Diamond Company has been at work an equal length of time with the Essex Company, and has had equal difficulties to overcome. This company may be said now to be fairly into the Swamp lead, and are likely to reap the reward their in domitable perseverance entitles them to. The Durham Company is almost at a stand, in consequence of the very heavy body of water in the rock. There is some talk of altering the constitution of this company, for the purpose of increasing the capital. Golden Point Lead. \u2014 The Cosmopolitan Company is still continuing to obtain first class wash-dirt, and there is every reason to believe they will be well paid for all their past labors and expenses. The Koh i-nor Company have been swamped out, and in consequence have had to sink their main shaft deeper, and are now engaged in putting in a main level at a greater depth than their former one, so as to drain the deeper ground. I am of opinion that they will have eventu ally to sink another shaft to the westward of their present one, so as to be able to work out the deepest portion of their ground. The late washings of this company were quite equal to any they have had, and there is every reason to believe that this jvill be one of the richest claims on Ballaarat. Quartz Reefs. \u2014 The Township Company's claim is at present at a standstill. An at tempt was made to oganize a new company to purchase and mine this claim, but the pro jectors were not successful.

I have the honor to report the state of my district for the three months ending 31st August, 1860, and to beg the indul gence of your honorable Board for omitting to forward my regular reports for the past months; the late rush for quartz claims has kept me fully employed, having surveyed, since the 1st of May, no less than 184; miles of quartz reefs by an average width of 500 feet. I have shown the position of the principal reefs on the accompanying plan and tracing, to which I beg to refer you. First on the plan is the Rob Roy Reef, from which a trial crushing yielded 7 dwt. per ton. Next is the Yorkshire Reef, which yielded 25 dwt. per ton ; the gold bearing stone on this reef is very white, and is called by the miners a \"milky quartz.\" Next is the Nil Desperandum Reef, 7 dwt. Next is Bu chan's Reef, none crushed. From the Sisters Reef (on the tracing) a trial crushing of 18 tons yielded nearly 11 oz., or 12 dwt. per ton nearly.

I I have already stated that the yield of quartz on Ballaarat is very small when com pared with other districts, but this is to a considerable extent compensated by the greater size of the lodes and softness of the country in which they are sound. also be of some importance to learn how far the theory is borne out by the experience of miners on other gold fields. During the last month the applications for quartz claims have been considerably less than in the preceding one, which is attribu table to the fact that all the known lodes in my district have been taken up, and that nothing of importance has been obtained by the prospecting parties. Besides natural advantages, it cannot be doubted that the systematic manner in which operations are carried on helps considerably to make smaller yields remunerative, as a great saving of time and labor is effected thereby. In alluvial miuing within my district there is no change. The old parties continue to carry on work steadily and are obtaining average returns. That the system of work on Ballaarat is superior to that of many districts, is shown by the fact that in my district a large number of companies are working profitably quartz which elsewhere would be thrown away in the rubbish heap. I beg herewith to forward cross sections of Black Hill, Ashes', Caledonian, Lady Barkly, aud Loug-look'd for Leads. Scarcely one company has been started recently on Ballaarat which has not succeeded iu obtaining at least a moderate profit, and where this has not been the case, the failure is traceable either to the lode running out or to palpable errors in the method of work. No. i Division, (M. O'Malley, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows I may mention that one or two companies have already commenced a different system of working their claims to that which has generally been adopted. In most cases it is usual to put in levels at various depths and work the lodes downwards, but a plan is now being carried out of working towards the surface. By this method it is expected that the work will be carried on with greater facility, and the claims be rendered secure from accidents arising from the ground caving in, which have very frequently occurred. The machinery is as follows; \u2014 A great deal of attention is now also being given to various systems of amalgamation, but I cannot report that any one system has yet been generally adopted, though some ex periments are now being made which seem likely to lead to increased knowledge of the subject. In prospecting for quartz lodes, the miners are frequently greatly embarrassed by the want of knowledge of the locality of the lodes as indicated by the leaders. A theory which originated at Bendigo has been recently brought into prominence here, namely, that the main lode is always sound b.tween clay slate and sandstone, and that any leader so encased will lead most directly to the lode. As far as my observations have hitherto ex tended, I am not able to give au opinion as to the correctness of the theory in question, but in future I shall pay particular attention to the subject, as, if it should prove true, much useless work would bo saved.

The New Homeward Bound and Mentor Com panies are fast discontinuing the windlass as a quartz-raising appliance, and substituting whims, a very important step in the pro gressive direction. The former company is but a new one (or rather an old one under a new name), composed principally of Bal laarat merchants, &c, and the operations are conducted under the superintendence of a gentleman (Mr. Frederick) who enjoys the reputation of a thoroughly experienced miner and crusher. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The following returns will convey an idea of the yield of the stone crushed at Porter and Company's (now Mentor Company) mill, for the twelve months ending the 18th of August, 1860: \u2014 No. of tons crushed, 4724 9 cwt. ; yield, 2942 oz. 8 dwt. 2 gr. This is the work of a battery of 10 stamps, and includes all stoppages. One crushing machine has been removed, and one added during rhe month. The Comet Company have been doing re markably well during the past month, having obtained 193 oz. 3 dwt. of gold from 155 tons of stone. These highly satisfactory results are the produce of the claims formerly known as Nos. 2 and 3 north, and were obtained at a depth of 90 feet in the former from a vein 3 feet wide, and in the latter at a depth of 60 feet from a vein 9 to 1 1 feet wide. These veins improve as they deepen. I have the honor to forward my report for the month of August, accompanied by the usual tables showing amount of population and machinery in my division. On the Napoleon Lead the Sons of Freedom Company has proved the existence of deep ground in close proximity to the shaft, but through being swamped out by the immense flow of water from the rock, has not been able to prosecute the search for the gutter for several months, and it will in all probability be a long time yet before work is resumed at the face of the drive.

Quartz Mining. \u2014 The All Nations Company, on Tower Hill, has crushed during the month about 240 tons of quartz, from various depths, with an average yield of 12 dwt. per ton. The Imperial Company, Hiscock's Reef, has completed the erection of an engine of 18 horse-power, lifting 12 heads of stampers, and has now commenced crushing, but I am unable to report on the yield at present. This company has very flattering prospects, having proved the existence of abundance of quartz, and their trial crushings being about 8 dwt. to the ton. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 \u25a0 The One and All Company, north of the Imperial Company, is busily engaged in pre paring a Bite for erecting a battery oi 16 stampers. The Standard Company, south of the Im perial Company, is erecting a battery of 12 heads, and has had satisfactory returns from their trial crushings. On the Scandinavian Reef, the Jenny Lind Company and Scandinavian West Company have amalgamated, and are negociating for machinery. These companies have also had payable returns from trial crushings. The aspect of mining affairs is vastly improved since general attention has been devoted to quartz; but notwithstanding all the facility offered to the miner in this district in working quartz claims, there is an abuse of the privileges granted under the present bye-law, which, if not soon stopped, will become a lasting evil. Under the 45th clause of the bye-law, a company can work their claim by contract, with any number of men, so long as the claim is worked efficiently. Unfortunately many of the speculators in this division have caused claims to be taken up by a certain number of miners' rights, and then worked, or rather kept possession of, ground intended for a large number of men by having one or two of the shareholders work ing by contract, so that many claims on the various reefs are now, although legally regis tered for, say, fifty men, held by two or three, who, instead of taking advantage of the bye law in the manner intended, are selling shares to the many who cannot get unoccupied ground to work. I have the honor to forward you the fol lowing short report of the state of the Smythe's Creek mining district (No. 6 Bal laarat) for the month of August, 1860. August, 1860. Smythesdale is nearly in the same state as at the date of my last report. The majority of the claims there are yielding steady and good returns. In the claim of the Surprise Company, Warren's Flat, a nugget weighing 46 oz. was lately found. Another of smaller size was found in the Morning Light claim ad- joining. The Sluicing Company at Frazer's Hill have suspended work. I fear the ground will not turn out remunerative. The Black Hill Company have dissolved partnership.

At the western base of the Black Hill a new lead has been discovered, which has turned out in the prospecting claim very rich. Several other claims have been since taken up there, but nothing particularly noticeable has further occurred. The Hibernia Company, on the Standard Lead, Linton, have been for some weeks receiving as high as \u00a380 per man. The Fly ing Buck about \u00a340 per man. The Hong Kong Lead, Black Hill, con tinues to give good returns. The shaft of the Smythesdale and Browne's Junction Company is through the rock. The shaft of the Liute Company, in allotment 4, Scarsdale, is about 80 feet in the rock. It is believed that the Hong Kong gutter will pass between these shafts. Scarcely has any new feature of interest transpired at Browne's during the mouth. The Victoria Quartz Mining Com pany, at the head of the Uld Browne's Lead, have obtained 17 dwt. per ton from a late crushing. This has given great encourage ment to other compauics, and matters have consequently a very cheerful aspect as re gards quartz mining. These returns will give an idea of the paying qualities of this lead. At Shicer Gully new lead several new shafts have been bottomed, and all doing well. The Chinese are nearly the exclusive occu pants of the old gullies around Linton's; aud I am of opinion that they are getting well recompensed in the majority of cases. At Carngham quartz mining has engrossed a great amount of interest during the last three months. The Britannia Reef seems to be improving with the depth ; 18 dwt. to tire ton is about the averge yield from the Bri tannia claim. Stimulated by such a yield, every available spot is already occupied as far as Mr. Russell's private property, and every hill and gully for a considerable dis tance around is enlivened with the presence of prospecting parties in search of new reefs. The lland-in-IIaud Company have sold their claim. The purchasers are about in augurating a new aud better order of opera tions, which will, 1 doubt not, greatly improve the dividends from this claim. On Monkey Gully, the Havelock, Prince of Wales, and Cambrian Companies are doing well, so are the gieater number of the claims on Italian Gully. One between Smythe's and Carngham has been discovered within the month, and is called Johnsou's Reef, in honor of the dis coveror. The Magna Charta Company have opened a drive at a depth from the surface of about 190 feet ; they expect to reach the gutter in a few days. Reviewing the state of the district gene rally, I am happy to be enabled to state that the Commencement of the present month found it in a very prosperous condition. The shaft of the Captain Finn Company, on the quartz reef near Gordon's Gully, is now 100 feet deep; they are about opening a drive to the lode. They have already dis covered gold in the northern end of the claim. There are two claims taken up here under the leasing regulations of 900 yards loDg each by 300 yards wide. Creswick Division.

The Havilah Lead is also progressing favorably, a party (the Sons of the Thames Company) who bottomed in the deep ground having got a prospect of a quarter of an ounce to the tub; but the increase of water is so great in this claim that the company will be obliged to get machinery to overcome it. At Mopoke the continuation of the Banjo Lead, which was lost three years since, has been recovered ; there cannot be much ground to work, however, as it must connect with the diggings in Mopoke Gully, and which is distant only about 20 chains from where gold is at present getting ; some of the claims arc very rich, yielding from 2 to 3 oz. to the tub, with from 3 to 5 feet of wash-dirt. A second machine for crushing cement, tailings, &c, has been started this month \u2014 the company's first crushing of 85 tons is not yet cleaned, I cannot therefore give the result. One of the companies on the Hard Hill (Burgess and party) had a crushing of 20 tons, which yielded 42 oz. 11 dwt. The Frenchman's Quartz Mining Company, on Frenchman's Reef, are now getting on very fairly ; the reef is improving in size, appear ance, and quality of the stone; the reef, which was only 2 feet at the surface, and much disintegrated, is now, at a depth of 40 feet, 10 feet wide, with all the indications of a settled reef. The quantity crushed in August was 320 tons, yielding 154 oz., or an average of 9 dwt. 15 gr. to the ton. On the same reef the Prince of Wales Company have suspended crushing opera tions, and are engaged sinking their shaft in order to try the lode at a lower level. Approximate value of machinery in this division \u00a390,000; charge for crushing cement from 20s. to 25s. per ton ; quartz from 20s. to 25s. per ton. The Spiinghill Quartz Mining Company, at Springhill, have discontinued working, and have abandoned their lease. The only new ground opened during the month in this division is at Graham's Hill, Long Point; the yield averages in three claims bottomed half a pennyweight to the tub ; the shaft of the prospecting party is through 3 feet of surface, then through 32 feet of basaltic rock, then through 6 feet of white cement with a layer of white clay, then through 8 feet of fine gravel to the wash-dirt, which is 5 feet in thickness, but the miners are only washing one foot in thickness; the cement or flint conglomerate is the hardest and most difficult to work of any I have ever known, steel drills requiring to be renewed every half-hour, and two inches being as much as a mau can drill in a shift of eight hours. Quartz mining in the Clunes portion of my district is monthly increasing in importance. Extended machinery for reducing the metal is either erected or former works improved upon. Two new batteries have recently been completed, making in all 112 heads of stamps erected here. This, together with the re-or ganizatiou of the North Clunes Company with a capital of \u00a320,000, and a new lease hold claim 900 yards by 300 yards, taken up by Lewis Grant, who expects shortly to start work, also the contemplated larger operations by the Alliance Company, are encouraging facts for this place.

Southward, in about 30 feet, it is 10 feet thick, answering to the bearings and underlay of the Eastern Reef as worked in the Southern companies. The more easterly lode may be a spur from the old vein, but I expect it will prove the heretofore-styled \" Welcome.\" The new kiln is finished; they are ready for laying down the iron trams and raise and increase the size of the passes.

The Wellington Reef prospect claim have raised some tons of quartz, which will be crushed in a few days. They promise equally good results as previous crushings, and the vein is looking steadier and has increased in thickness. The Gibraltar Company have, for the pre sent, suspended operations. The alluvial diggings on Morrison's are comparatively quiet, owing to the rush to the Tea-tree Creek. The Perseverance Company are working their ground ; still, as I before referred to, I believe they are about to have some quartz crushed, taken from a very poor vein, south of their main shaft \u2014 more, I should imagine, for the purpose of testing its quality than for any hopes of even a payable return. Claims have been taken up to a great extent on the tableland between the two diggings, and persons are anxiously awaiting the result of the deep sink:ng there ; for, as I before remarked, if gold is found in payable quantities on the tableland, there is ground sufficient for many thousands of men.

It is called the German Lead. The prospects from the first shaft, which is 66 feet deep, vary from the color to nearly 2 dwt. to the dish. In the prospect shaft there are two gutters some 15 feet apart, with a reef of 5 feet high in tervening. The claims are being taken and work commenced, and it is to be hoped that the lead will be more successfully followed up than the others that have been discovered in the forest. (H.

Lehman's party have com menced making returns from their expensive tail race, which is brought to 15 feet below the level of the creek, thereby having a com plete command of it. Harrup's party have finished deepening and boxing their great length of tail race. (See my plan sent on the 14th February, 1860.) They say their fall is 2 inches in the 12 feet box ; this they find is much more than sufficient to carry off their tailings, and they could afford to lower the boxes at the upper end of the tail race several feet, by which means they will get a better command of the bed of the creek. Berry and Company are progressing with theirexpensive tail race on the Woolshed (see my plan of the 14th January); it is now some 2000 yards long, upon which they have been constantly employed for the last fourteen months. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The steam engine of 8 horse-power, set upbyRawden and Company on the Woolshed Creek, for the purpose of lifting up the dirt some 20 feet, together with the water which sluiced it into a well, by the use of iron buckets on an endless band of vulcanized India rubber, and thrown into the sluice boxes, has been found not to act well. They have, in consequence, adopted the plan of ground sluicing and lifting up the water only by the engine, the tailings being banked with the assistance of bushes placed in layers. Since my report for August there has been a fall of rain of four inches, which has been es great benefit to the district, enabling many of the miners to recommence sluicing operations, which, in consequence of the dry ness of the season, they had been compelled to abandon and take to driving, tub and cradle.

Another quartz reef has been discovered during the month, named Henderson's Reef, after the discoverer, and is situated on the ranges at the head of Twist's Creek. Twenty one claims have been registered and marked out thereon. In the prospectors' shaft the reef is over 3 feet 6 inches wide, but is not down more than 8 feet. Claims Nos. 1, 6, and 7 south, have struck narrow leaders, from which some rich-looking stone has been got; also claim No. 5 north has got a leader about 4 inches wide, the stone from which shows gold very plentiful but fine. On the Comasino Reef four more claims have been taken up, making fourteen in all. No stone from either reef has been crushed as yet ; I therefore cannot give any definite idea as to the probable yield, but hope to be able to do so in my next report, as two parties from Henderson's Reef and Comasino Reef intend sending some stone to be crushed at the Indigo, that being the nearest place where any crushing machinery is to be had. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Alluvial mining : \u2014 Horse puddling mills 6 Hydraulic hoses ... ... 3 Water wheels for draining claims ... ... ... 59 Quartz mining \u2014 None. Our having experienced a succession of wet weather during the past month has caused an ample supply of water for all sluices, and although slightly retarding mining operations, yet has proved of great benefit in giving all race-owners a prospect of a good supply of water far into the sum mer months. But one work of any import ance has been commenced or completed during the month, and that is the commence ment of another extensive tail race, situated below Osborne's Flat, Yackandandah Division. This tail race, when finished, will be over 600 yards long, and will require some heavy blasting, it having to be cut through the falls immediately below Osborne's Flat, and is intended to be used in working a claim of 500 yards in length on Osborne's Flat. This system of tail races is coming extensively into use in both divisions, there being now no less than 15 completed or in course of completion, the amount of ground allowed by the bye-laws being 5 chains, generally 100 yards long each claim, giving the parties ample work for two or three years, thereby inducing them to settle down, and, in fact, make a regular business of min ing, contrasting favorably with their former nomadic habits. But very few of our miners seem to be infected with the Snowy River fever, seeming to prefer a steady remunera tion throughout the year, to the chance (and that but a small one) of doing well on the Snowy River for only three or four months. I herewith forward a plan of portion of Yackandandah Creek, showing boundary of worked ground adjoining, &c. The Town ship Hills, shown on plan, have been re markably rich, and would pay well to re work with a good head of water and the hydraulic hose, there being an ample fall for both head and tail races.

Fifteen claims have been taken up on these reefs, and six additional claims on reefs before discovered. At present, on the discovery of a reef, there are generally only two or three claims taken up ; as the reefs do not appear to run any great distance, near the surface, and the miners have too little capital to sink deep. For the same reason, many fine-looking reefs, which do not show gold on the surface, are neglected. Of the reefs discovered this month, the Canadian, Lanarkshire, and Albion look the most promising, and are at present good strong reefs. Additional machinery has arrived this month: the engine purchased by Mr. Stevens, also Messrs. Mackay's, and an engine of 15 horse-power, and machinery consisting of wet stampers and shaking tables, from the Adelong, New South Wales, brought over by Messrs. Snow and Ward, and purchased since by Pascoe and Company, of the Oriental Keef. They have not yet commenced to erect it. In addition to the above machinery, there are this mouth 12 hydraulic sluices at work, and 1 idle, on the Buckland River. In reference to the Buckland River portion of my district there is nothing additional to report this month. The alluvial claims con tinue to yield average wages; aud owing to a considerable fall of rain during the last fortnight, the supply of water for sluicing is better than during the previous month, when the river was unusually low. Messrs. Gitchell and Company are also putting up a machine on Richardson's Reef, and Messrs. Perry's machine on the Ebenezer will soon be completed. On the Buckland Reefs quarts mining re mains at present as before reported. Some of the stone from the Nelson Reef is looking well, but norre has been crushed this month. The water mill is not yet completed, as the company are waiting the arrival of some new machinery from Melbourne. The other reefs which I mentioned last month are still being prospected, but with uncertain results as yet. I have the honor to append the following information respecting the yield and pros pects of claims from which quartz has been crushed during the month. On the Oriental Reef there has been consi derable improvement in some of the quartz ; especially from the claim of Cotsworth and Company (No. 1 south), some of which has yielded 5 oz. per ton, and 400 tons is stated to have averaged 4 oz. per ton. The stone from Messrs. Pascoe and Company's claim has yielded an average of 3 oz. per ton. The prospectors' claim continues to yield about lj oz., and this yield with such a hulk of stone pays handsomely. Rossiter and Com pany's claim (No. 1 north) also continues to look well ; and this company are sinking a shaft to a considerable depth on the dip of the reef to prove its value, as they intend, should it continue to look well, to erect more ma chinery. The reef has been struck in the tunnel on the north end of the claim, but it is only a few inches thick, and apparently non-auriferous. The company, in consequence of this, do not intend to apply for a lease at present. 1 am unable to state the yield of this claim, as the company object to making it public. During the month it has been reported at the police station (Ovens River) that a pay able gold field has been discovered at the head of the Ovens, about 70 miles above its junc tion with Morse's Creek. At present, how ever, it is impossible to give any further in formation respecting it, the country being deeply covered with snow. Many of the miners in the district state their intention of going there in the course of a few weeks, and should a rush occur, I will visit the locality, and forward a report of its prospects, &c. A few payable sluicing claims have also been opened on Morse's Creek. Quartz mining continues prosperous in the Ovens River District. There have been seven new reefs registered during August, and named as follows:\u2014 The Canadian, White Rose, Lanarkshire, Cambrian, Finnils, Ulster, and Albion ; the first six being situate on the A quantity of stone has also been crushed from No. 3 south, but only yielded 14 dwt. per ton.

Four or five of them have been abandoned for the present, principally for want of sufficient means on the part of the miners to test them tho roughly. On Mead's Reef the Enterprise Company have paid off their hired hands for the pre sent, as the last crushing did not pay more than their wage3, and they are now sinking deeper to test the reef. There are no claims working now on this reef except the prospec tors' and No. 1 north, which is amalgamated with it. When the machinery now in course of erection is completed, I hope to be able to report more fully of the later discoveries, and to verify my reports of the promising cha racter of many of the reefs from which no quartz has been crushed hitherto. The amalgamated claims of Messrs. Gander and Gitchell, on Gander's Reef, have conti nued to pay well ; the yield is stated to have been 3 oz. per ton. The wet shaft is now down 70 feet, and the water is so heavy that an engine will soon have to be erected for pumping. The best stone comes from this shaft, and a small quantity only having been raised from this portion of the claim will account for there being a less yield than from some former crushings. I have the honor to forward herewith a portion of the surface detail plans of the Oriental Reef on a scale of eight feet to an inch, and which comprise all the surface workings on the prospecting claim, No. I north and No. 1 south. With reference to the sheet marked Pros pectors' Claim, the letters B C show the length and position of the reef, the uncolored portion A C having been worked from the surface; the shafts marked D have been timbered up for raising the quartz, and the intermediate spaces are occupied by galleries, which have been filled up by mullock from the reef and surface soil. The other two shafts communicate with the tramway, which has been constructed along the reef (marked Tramway from Claims) by means of two open cuts on the same level, and from one of which there is a short branch tunnel, at the head of which another shaft will be formed; the space marked a a a has also been levelled, and is used for stacking timber and quartz ; letters E and F show the sites occu pied by workshops ; H shows the break of Gitchell's tramway, and consists of a strong framing, H, and a break wheel constructed of a series of stout staves marked c c c, &c. ; these are 3 feet in length, and made concave in the middle, and are bolted on to the inner felloes of the wheel marked d. The break ing power is obtained by two iron bands, one fixed as a tire on the upper circumference of the wheel, and by the other one marked b, acted on by the lever arrangement ef, being tightened on to the fixed one when required. The wire rope, \u00a7 inch in diameter, passes twice round the break and over the pullies, A A. G is a square paddock cut in the rock for the reception of quartz, and K K is the platform or level portion of the tramway where the trucks are filled. The rails on this tramway are fastened to the sleepers by means of wedges, instead of spiking them down. This plan proves to be the most se cure, and the rails when worn out are more easily removed. From the Elgin Reef the remainder of Stevens and Company's quartz has been crushed, and has yielded 5 oz. per ton. There are now two men employed in this claim sink ing for the second reef. From the prospectors' claim about 120 tons has been crushed, which turned out a fine cake of 126 oz. The other two claims in this line are still registered on account of excessive drainage. There has been a trial crushing of 6 tons from the Wocester Reef (prospecting claim), but it only yielded about 10 dwt. per ton. As it is a strong reef, however, the party are still persevering. Another trial crushing from No. 2 south yielded 1J oz. per ton. There has also been a crushing from the prospecting claim on the White Star Reef, the yield being 2 oz. per ton. From No. 3 south, on the Hampton Reef, 20 tons has been crushed, and yielded 5 oz. person; the vein is about 18 inches thick. The prospecting claim continues to look well, but no more quartz has been crushed yet. No. 1 south is tunnelling, and Nos. 1 north and 2 south sinking ; the latter party have struck the vein, but have not payable stone yet. No quartz has been crushed this month from any other claim. The prospectors on the Victoria Reef are bringing their quartz over to Rossiter's tram way, and are still sinking in the reef. Richardson's, the Buckeye, Ebenezer, William 'fell's, Australasia, Lisbon, West Briton, Cornishman's, Falkner's, and Hiber nian Reefs, may be mentioned as continuing to look particularly well. The Welcome Reef With reference to the sheet marked No. 1 north, A B shows the portion of reef which"], [401, "MINING SUBVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 AUGUST. 213 has been worked from the surface. D and E are shafts for winding up quartz, at present out of use ; these shafts are in the dip of the reef and are timbered round with slabs, slabs (marked 6 shaft D) being also placed longtitudinally on the foot-wall to save the wear of the oxhide buckets. G G are gal leries between the shafts, which are un stowed at present ; the letters a a a show the timbering of the reef, and letters A C show the continuation of the reef through the claim. Letter H shows the position and plan of the break on Rossiter and Co.'s line ; a is the break wheel mounted on a strong frame 6, and being provided with a stout rim of iron 3 inches wide. The breaking power is obtained by the use of another iron band made in three segments, on to the inside of which are bolted strong wooden segments, and the whole acted on by the lever arrangement t f. By means of these wooden segments, which wear for about three weeks, the wear of the iron rims is prevented and a better breaking power obtained. The wire rope, mm (I inch in diameter) passes round the break wheel and crossing round the sheaves kll. south, A B shows the course of the reef, and the letters C C, &c, the position of the shafts now used for ventilation only. The reef takes a more easterly course through the greater part of this claim, as will be seen by the colored portion of the plan. All the quartz is being raised by way of the tunnels marked on the plan at the heads of which shafts are going down on the dip of the reef, which is at present easterly in the above claims. The colored portions of the plans on the line of the reef show its course where the surface has not been removed. SANDHURST MINING DISTRICT. No. 1, or Kangaroo Flat Division. (Edward T. Harper, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Owing to the weight of the rope on so long a line, it has been found necessary to have a \"clutch\" to secure the rope upon the arrival on the platform of the ascending carriage. This clutch consists of two short wooden beams, g g, which are fitted with square blocks of wood (removable when worn out) meeting exactly at the crossing of the rope by means of the lever arrangement h h ; these blocks are strained together in the crossing of the rope, and prevent it from slipping: the lever is then secured by a pin in the frame 6 There are several rollers pp, &c, over which the rope runs, to keep it off the ground. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The space marked K shows the site of black smith's shop and storehouse. The space marked P is occupied by a pad dock for the temporary stowage of quartz on its way from the other claims, the tramway from which is on a level of 20 feet above the bottom of the paddock. It was originally proposed to bring this line on to the same level, in order to save having to shift the quartz twice ; but it was found impracticable, on account of the high levels of the various shafts and tunnels. The claim of Rossiter and Company is worked at present entirely by way of the main tunnel, the course of which is shown from the head of the quartz paddock. Alluvial Mining. \u2014 Much improvement has taken place in this branch on Sandhurst, owing greatly to the superabundance of water which has been steadily falling (with the exception of one flood) throughout the whole month, and evidently, as is always the case, as the washing material becomes more scarce, the demand increases.

Cooper's Comet Company, on the summit of the hill, are in constant work raising and crushing ; they have a large claim in two leases, one on the Redan and the other on the Sophia Reef, and are at the present time employing upwards of 100 men ; their yield of gold weekly ranges widely from 150 oz. to 300 oz. In their lower drive they have cut both the Bagman's and the Sophia Reefs, and are supposed to be now draining a great portion of the reef to the north. It is highly gratifying to see an increase in the number of alluvial miners, all of whom, I am satisfied, are doing well; there are a number of tub and cradle men also, but they are gradually falling off, the remuneration for who-e labor is quite inadequate to their maintenance. Very few of the steam puddling com panies have commenced operations as yet. The Bendigo Valley, North British, Kangaroo Flat, and the Enterprise Companies are among the number, the last mentioned of whom, it is expected, will shortly make a start with one of Thompson's patent conical cylinders, which has been proved the best extant. The Back Creek plant was offered at auction, and bought in by the company at \u00a3850 The waterworks alluvial washing ground is still lying idle, shutting up a valuable piece of ground which could be advantageously worked by the puddlers. Wade and Blair's claims are doing well; their aveiage yield is about 3 oz. per ton, at a depth of about 225 feet along the underly shalt. The Ironbark Company's claim is doing pretty well; last week's work yielded 70 oz.; this is on the Sophia Reef. Silk and Company, and Johnson and Com pany, on the Sophia, are also doing very well ; they are both raising stone from below water level, yielding 2 or 3 oz. per ton. It is a pity that more of these already formed companies do not go to work with a determination to give the ground a fair trial (say) for three months ; as I do not see why, with strict economy and careful management (without which nothing will prosper), that they should not one and all answer. Stanley's Reef. \u2014 Stanley and Company in their claim are taking up all the stone they passed in the drive, while following the very rich quartz which was discovered some time back; both the eastern and western reefs are being worked, and both found highly remu nerative. Palmer and Company, to the north, are also gettirrg very good stone, as well as Wilkie and Company, to the south. Quartz Mining. \u2014 This branch has been rather stagnant the last three or four months back, owing to the numerous workings on the various well-known lines of reefs having been put back or stopped altogether, owing to many of the best yielding claims having been purchased by or thrown into the many public companies which have been formed on Bendigo, many of which have not yet got to work, and some others not completed their water shaft, until which shall have been com pleted, and the reefs drained, no greater depth can be attained; but I am happy to say that many are in an advanced state, and many claims have already been enabled to sink considerably below the water level, which has loog been waited for with the greatest excitement in this district. Tyson's Reef. \u2014 The Tyson's Reef Company have just struck another golden reef about 25 feet to the east of their main shaft; some handsome specimens were taken therefrom ; its entire thickness is not yet known. Several of the outside claims on this line are now beginning to look up, and shortly something more favorable may be reported therefrom. Paddy's Gully Reef. \u2014 The prospect of this line is looking much brighter. Smith and Company have been crushing stone for 1J oz. to the ton, and plenty of it. Watson and Company, to the north, are also getting good stone from the same lead. Tipper and Com pany, to the south, have tried some of the same stone from the water level, but not so good ; 1 believe they are not sufficiently deep for the same run of gold which dips to the south, while the quartz or reef dips to the north. The pumping engine is not as yet doing much good in the way of draining; the engine shaft is sunk the required depth it is supposed, and is now being driven to the east in which direction-it is expected the reef will be .Struck, when the south claims will be enabled to sink 100 feet at least below water level; the Union and Hope Companies will then have an oppoitunity of searching for the Hustler's Reef \u2014 On this line a new spur was struck to the south of Ironbark Gully, and was found payable in two claims ; stone yielding 2 oz, to the ton was raised from it. Latham and Watson's claim, in the gully, have discovered some excellent stone on the old line ; they have also struck anew reef at a greater depth than has hitherto been obtained. The Hustler's Reef Company will be completed and ready to start finally in a week; with their pumping engine, at a depth of 230 feet, which will set the whole line in motion, and great results may be expected therefrom."], [403, "MINING SUBYEYOES' BEPOETS \u2014 AUGUST. 215 second reef, which I make no doubt will be cut at 20 or 30 feet below their present depth of 170 feet. I saw several specimens taken from the spurs, which were very rich indeed ; the appearance and position of these spurs would lead me to suppose that a good reef will be found wh\"re these bodies form a junction (say in the next level) 60 feet deeper, as they have been traced along and found to be just in line with the various leads. Garden Gully Reef. \u2014 This line, with the ex ception of about three claims, is entirely idle, a little gold is being obtained by those who are persevering, but nothing can be done with the water. Perseverance Reef, Long Gully. \u2014 Three claims on this line are raising stone for crush ing; Kershaw and Company are working down a western spur which is evidently leading on to the main reef, which was struck at a depth of 120 feet, aud below water level ; the stone they are now raising will pay them very well, until they can find means of working the lower reef. Eaglehawk Division. (Geo. Wm. Hart, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 New Chum Reef. \u2014 The New Chum Com pany have finally commenced pumping and crushing; they have evidently drained the whole hill, the shaft on the summit (Ph\u0153nix Company) being 220 feet deep, and many of the claims have now got to work. The first level in the New Chum Company's shaft at 100 feet deep has cut the E. and W. limbs of the reef, which are evidently dying out, being only a few inches in thickness each, but it is reasonable to expect that the second reef will be cut in the next level, which will be 60 feet below the present one. A large new body of stone was struck in the west drive, never discovered before, and about 5 feet thick; it has not yet been tried, but is ex pected to be good; the company are raising stone from the old workings meantime, to keep the engine, if possible, in constant work; they are at present employing about 40 men. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 Victoria Reef. \u2014 On the South Victoria Hudson is working a small irregular body of stone, now underlying to the east, now to the west, and sometimes perfectly flat or horizontal, about 4 inches thick, but very rich, yielding about 6 oz. to the ton. The Ph\u0153nix Company, to the south, have at last got upon the same body, and are now raising some for trial. Mr. Burrows, to the north of Hudson, is working the Black Lead, and taking up stone which is thought will turn out very well. Wybrant, the next claim in the gully, is working the top stone, which pays tolerably well. The Medway, on the North Victoria, have driven to the west and found the Old Victoria Reef at a higher level than was expected ; the stone was rich with gold, but I have not heard the result of any crushing therefrom. Wittscheibe, iu the next claim, have struck the lees, but not the same run of gold. The Victoria Mines Company, in their 220 feet level, have struck three or sour small bodies of quartz apparently making in towards each other, with gold in each of them ; I have the honor to lay before the Board of Science the annexed tabular statement for the month of August. In consequence of the greater portion of the alluvial ground now being rendered free, many tub and cradle miners have returned to their former pursuit, and I have observed several places now occupied that had been for a long time deserted ; this may, however, be attributed to the abundance of water. The puddling is also rather on the increase than otherwise, especially in some of the small gullies opeued within the last year in the vicinity of the Whipstick Road, where several small nuggets and payable ground have been Europeans.

A rather vigoious rush has lately taken place at Huntly, on a part of the flat lying about half a mile east of the Back Creek, and at six miles from Sandhurst. I am of opinion that this ground will ulti mately be sound to be a branch of the great Huntly Lead. It is shallow sinking with a thick stratum of auriferous drift, and pro duces from 14 to 17 dwt. to the load. It makes good wages for the Huntly miners, and is found just when it is wanted, as many of them, I regret to say, have suffered se verely from the late inundations \u2014 by that unfortunate occurrence about five hundred men have been deprived of work. All the claims in the vicinity of the Miners' Arms Hotel are completely flooded, most probably never to be recovered, unless the powerful pumping engine adjacent to them, and now nearly ready, be able to drain them. Some of the ground has fallen in from the surface, and the entire flat in that neighborhood is deeply covered with silt, brought down by the flood, all which gives the place a most deplorable appearance. This accident was to be anticipated, as for a long time past the creek having been filled up with silt and dry sludge, the water had full play on the ad jacent flat, and no channel exists capable of carrying off the storm water which rushes down here with great impetuosity. Should such anothor flood occur, the damage that would be done at Huntly would be very great, as all the ground in the lead is exca vated, and being now much weakened by its last saturation, it is not improbable that a sinking of a large area would be the con sequence. The Miners' Arms Hotel aud many stores are built upon this dangerous ground. The Eaglehawk United Steam Puddling Company have at length commenced ope rations. Their machinery consists, for the present, of one revolving cylinder, and one mill on the principle of the old horse mill ; the latter appears to me to be the more effective of the two, as most of the gold produced by the first day's puddling, both machines being at work and supplied from the same place, came from the mill. I believe that it is the intention of the company, should the experi ment succeed, to erect several others. But the most novel feature of this mining plant is, the means employed to raise the washing stuff to the level of the platform (about 12 feet). Hitherto the usual method has been to draw the laden trucks up an inclined plane by steam power ; but in this case they are run on to a lift, and raised to the required height by a hydraulic ram ; they afterwards run down an inclined plane by their own weight ; in this way a great economy of steam power is effected. This company's establishment appears tome the best devised and most effective of any for puddling pur poses that I have visited. On the reefs the pumping machines are beginning to take effect on the subterraneous waters, and soon some of the workings will be completely drained. When this is done, I believe that very few of the now unworked claims will remain idle. Water is the only impediment to general exertion on the part of the quartz miner. I hope that in a month one at least will be sufficiently dry as to permit me to make a general survey for the purpose of submitting the plans thereof to the Board of Science. Kilmore Division. (F. M.

With the exception of a new reef, the Wellington, being opened, the prospecting claim for which I have marked off, the quartz mines remain much the same as lastmonth. The Wellington Reef, as found in the prospecting claim, has a bearing of N. 32\u00b0 W\u201e and is what is termed by miner a saddle reef, or, in other words, a vein of quartz branching from the cap in two distinct underlies, viz., one to the east and the other to the west.

The population is as follows : \u2014 On the King Parrot Creek, Fortune and Company are still sinking their water shaft on the Triangle Lead, and until their pumping ma chinery gets fairly to work, I am of opinion that no thorough trial, can be given to the claims on that line, as np to the present no reef has been struck, and the presence of water has prevented the auriferous leaders from being followed down. A new quartz vein bas been struck on the spurs running easterly from the Boundary Range, aud in close proximity to where the Yankees were working last year. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 At Yea matters still look promising. The Providence Reef, under a new management and fresh shareholders, is likely to receive a thorough trial. On the Carriers' Keef, although water has been struck, still I believe that the known richness of the quartz from thence will prove a sufficient inducement to the claimholders on that line to erect effective machinery for draining the reef. The new reef, German Jack's, opened at the Tea-tree, and noticed in my last report, has not yielded according to expectation, although payable. Jouner's, the Dunrobin, Enniskillen, &c, seem still likely to give handsome results to the shareholders. Regarding mining matters generally, there is no cause to complain ; the late heavy rains have supplied the deficiency 60 strongly felt by the puddlers, and though there is nothing of moment to communicate, yet appearances generally seem more favorable than usual. With respect to tbe plan of Chinaman's Flat Lead just forwarded, some explanation might not be deemed unnecessary. From a, the top of the lead, to c, the lead is shallow and altogether occupied by Chinese. Three parties, assisted by Government, are already out prospecting in this division, and from the nature of the ground selected, more particularly referring to the tributaries of the head waters of the river Goulburn, I believe many good creek diggings will be discovered ; although, from what I can learn, it is not probable that any large auriferous flats will be discovered.

The one called the Red Lead, varying in depth from 60 to 80 feet, lost at m ; and though in this several rich deposits had been found on the bottom (pipe-clay), yet the average yield of the headings (from 4 to 6 feet high) had given more satisfactory returns. The other called the White Lead, varying in depth from 40 to 128 feet, lost at s. Vertical sections Nos. 1 and 2 will show the character of this lead in the places referred to. running nearly parallel to it. There are no indications of a reef on the surface, a fine flat. However, the prospectors at the depth of 2 feet struck the cap, which turned out very favorable specimens, and which resulted in the granting of a prospecting claim, after which some thirty claims have been taken up on either side of the prospectors. Orl visiting the ground I discovered No. 1 north to have met with similar success, and it is not unlikely that many other claimholders will be equally as fortunate. Engine Claim. \u2014 This portion of the lead is 115 feet deep, all old ground, except some occasional blocks. The company consists of fifteen men. Engine (old), 10 horse-power.

Gibraltar. \u2014 The little rush to this place is by degrees presenting a more important aspect. There are about 400 men busily employed, some working out their claims, while others persevere in sinking their shafts, a process now found very difficult to accom plish from the means at the disposal of the present occuparrts, for (as suggested in my last report relative to the increase of water in a southerly direction) it is now fully proved that in some of the claims eight men baling alternately with 20-gallon buckets cannot keep the water down. The run of gold has been traced in the di rection of the McCullum's Creek old lead to a place called the Horseshoe Point, which had previously been rushed, but had been aban doned (though at that time proved to contain gold in payable quantities) in consequence of the miners having failed to master the water with buckets. From those two successive experiments it is quite evident that a good pumping engine must be supplied to enable the miners to work the ground with any success.

It is being traced in a northerly direction ; there are at least 1300 miners actively engaged in mining operations, who are getting fairly remunerated for their labors; there is every probability it will extend a considerable dis tance further than it is traced to at present ; there is a little water to contend with, which gradually increases as it nears the creek, and no doubt its resources will ultimately be developed by steam power. Rocky Flat. \u2014 This lead, the next in im portance to Scandinavian, and situated to the eastward of it, and distant therefrom about a quarter of a mile, is giving employ ment to over 300 miners, with a fair remu neration. It is believed by many to be a continuation of the Scandinavian, and in con sequence the ground between both is closely shepherded ; there is likewise water to con tend with, but not sufficient to retard mining operations. There is one 10 horse-power engine erected on the east end of the lead, and the company bottomed a shaft last week, but has not had time to give the ground a testing. Two others are in course of erec tion, and should their labors be attended with success, others will quickly follow. I trust to be able to furnish plans and sections of those important leads with my next report, likewise a description of the various strata, &c. &c. On the Avoca main lead the Chinese have recently taken up a considerable portion of the deep old workings; the ground they occupy has only been partially worked, and known yet to contain patches of rich deposits, but in consequence of an immense quantity of water found in a gravel strata lying near the schist formation, this part of the lead for nearly three years past has been quite abandoned, and, I presume, the pre sent party (without efficient steam power) will not be able to work the same re muneratively. At Lamplough small rushes in the im mediate vicinity are of frequent occurrence, together with numbers of prospecting holes being sunk, in some of which payable drift in the shallow ground is obtained, but cannot in any instance trace a lead of gold, or payable workings into the main flat or deep sinking. At Amphitheatre the rush which occurred lately is situate about four miles north of the township, and although a great portion of the miners have left it again, those remaining are doing very well ; the auriferous drift (one foot thick) yields from 1 oz. to 1| oz. to the load. A section of these workings I purpose furnishing in my next. At the Mountain Hut alluvial mining is confined principally to horse puddling, at which, during the wet season, very good wages can be made. The quartz vein lately opened, from one crushing, has yielded 1 oz. 17 dwt. to a ton ; three feet thickness of stone ; only six claims are working. Avoca Division. (R English, Mining Surveyor.)

The machinery is as follows: \u2014 On the north end of the same reef, in Beynon and Company's amalgamated claim, the shaft is 340 feet deep; the pumps are being got in, and will be ready to pump in another month, when the shaft will be con tinued to a depth of 400 feet before driving for the reef. The Specimen Hill Company are purchasing an engine for pumping and winding, aud in the meantime are taking out stone for crush ing, which is expected to yield about 3 oz. per ton. The Stony Reef Company, whose first crushing did not turn out payable, are now crushing a large quantity with better prospects. The Greeks Hill and Wilson Reef Com pany, whose first crushing yielded about 8 dwt. per ton, have purchased a crushing machine, and are getting ready a large quantity of stone. The population is distributed as follows: \u2014 I forward sections of claims Nos. 5 and 6 north on Poverty Reef, showing the forma tion of the reef; explanations are annexed to each section. The formation shown in the annexed sections* is characteristic of all the reefs I have had an opportunity of examining in this division during the last three years. The lode or reef appears to be formed in blocks, generally longer and much deeper than in the sections, thick in the middle and tapering to each end, and generally, but not always, overlapping each other as in Section 3, and between the overlapped parts from a few inches to sometimes several feet of soft schistose casing, so that in working out a block, as in section 3, from B towards A, when it is worked out the reef or commencement of the next block would be found to the left or right, and in working the reef downwards the blocks may be underneath each other, as in section 1, or considerably to one side, as in the diagram forwarded, which shows a case where the reef had been worked to a and had apparently run out, when the shaft was cairied down to c, where a very small vein of quartz was struck, which was followed and led to the reef at b. The quartz at the present depth of 270 feet is of a hard flinty character, and the yield of gold is about 2$ oz. per ton. At 150 feet in depth the quartz was of a more porous or honey-combed kind, and the yield in claim No. 5 averaged more than 6 oz. per ton. The population has increased during the month, and alluvial mining has somewhat improved ; several small rushes have occurred in the neighborhood of old ground, viz., at Dunolly, Wild Dog, Burnt Creek, and Wattle Flat, at which places a considerable number of miners are profitably employed. The rush to Dunolly is situated within a half mile north-west of the town, in 40 to 50 feet sink ing in wet ground; about 150 claims are taken up, twelve of which are bottomed, and four are getting gold averaging from 2 to 3 dwt. to a tub. Iu quartz mining there is no change of any impoitance to report; the numerous reefs in the division are being worked in their usual energetic manner, with the exception of Windmill Hill, near Dunolly, the prospectors on which have had a crushing, the result of which has caused them to pay off most of their hands.

The general characteristic of my division is a succession of ranges and gullies, formed by the mica schist and sandstone rock; the general bearing of the ranges bp'ing N N.W. by S.S.E., and that of the gullies east and west, falling into the main valleys on each side of the main ranges, and of necessity following the same direction; these ranges being iu nearly every instance very steep, the centre of the valleys on either side are worn away by the rapid passage of water, in some places to the bed rock, these courses being from ten to twenty feet deep, all of which in places have been found to be more or less auriferous. These, as also the main valleys (in consequence of the smallness of the population for some time) have never been thoroughly tried ; two only of the gullies have been worked, and in both instances found to be highly remunerative, as much as thirty pounds weight of gold having been taken from one claim. This place being at times subject to great drought, the bulk of the alluvial miners are compelled to remove elsewhere in the summer, leaving those only who are depend ent on the reefs. I think on this account and the highly auriferous appearance of the country, that there is no gold field to which a supply of water would be more advan tageous, or from which greater results would follow. In walking through the scrub to the north-east ofthe township, I have on several occasions picked up quartz containing gold ; even the most cursory inspection of the numerous quartz veins cannot fail to convey tbe impression that with anything like an adequate supply of water, mining operations on the most extensive scale would be carried on. The population, in general, is settled, the greatest proof of which being the survey and sale of nearly two thousand acres of town and suburban allotments, the whole of which have been purchased by the residents, the majority of whom are miners at present en gaged in mining, and in some instances cultivating their ground, and in every case improving it ; another proof of their per manent settlement being no inclination to leave for any rush that has occurred, even Inglewood or the Snowy River, although many, both from Adelaide and elsewhere, have passed through St. Arnaud on their way. Some of these have returned, and in many instances have remained in preference to leaving. The gold workings in my district consist principally of quartz reefs, as enumerated * Those at work only.

The El Dorado and Gap Reefs were the first two discovered, aud have been most prolific in their yields, having been principally worked some years ago, and the returns from which, when crushed by such crude machinery as then existed, yielded as much as 40 oz. to the ton on the former, and 35 oz. on the latter, the general average being about 2 oz. per ton, and this taken 15 or 16 feet thick. The El Dorado on Wilson's Hill is now nearly aban doned, Messrs. Lewis and Company being the only claimholders who have done any real amount of work: their claim is situate on the southern slope of the hill, the northern slope being held by three other claims, who are working some small leaders both on the east and west side of the main reef, the surface of which was formerly worked, the con tinuation of which runs through their claim, and, on the surface, presents a mass of quartz about 15 feet thick, which, at the depth of 200 feet, does not seem to diminish (see plan I.). The Gap, like Wilson's Hill, is being worked by three parties, two of whom are working leaders on the west side, the third working the continuation of the Gap on its northern strike. The Trinidad Reef, for some time past, has had only one party at work. St. Arnaud Gold Mining Company, having a lease of the same, have employed men to sink a shaft to cut the reef on its underlay, at about 100 feet ; they have also had men working it on the surface, and from the quartz lately taken from thence, and the prospect obtained from washing, I have no hesitation in saying (if it were a fair trial of the mass) that it would yield over 1 oz. per tun. This company's dam in Armenian Gully has just been completed, the excavated reservoir being nearly 100 feet square and 10 feet deep at base, the embankment 7 feet above this ; the site being most advantage ously chosen, both for the convenience of machinery aud the delivery of spoil from the nrine. Immediately below the dam the China men are working the alluvial, depth of sink ing from 18 to 22 feet, and averaging J dwt. to the tub. There is no defined gutter in this gully, the gold lying at the side of little hollows in the rock, and generally about 3 inches from the bottom, in fine red gravel, the bed rock being composed of micaceous schist. The gold found in the auriferous deposits in this district, is not in the gutter or deepest ground, but about half-way up the side of the low reef, or even on the top, the gutter in nearly every instance being filled with sand. Near the Bald Hill at the Erivan Hill, situate about 4 miles to the E.S.E. of St. Arnaud township, some parties are sinking on the cement hills, sinking from 13 to 20 feet deep, yield from J oz. to 1 oz. per load, gold fine, and the population daily increasing. At the Erivan Lead, about 2 miles N.W. of this, some parties are also prospecting, the yield and quality of gold being the same. At Peter's Diggings, on the same line of made hills, but distant about 5 miles, the same sinking prevails, the gold being heavier in character. Stuart's Hill. \u2014 This hill is situate about one mile and a quarter to the N.N.W. of St. Arnaud, and in a line with Wilson's Hill, the main reef from which extends to this hill, rising and dipping with every undulation of the surface, and, in one or two places, ap pearing above the surface for many yards, and at one (called Sebastopol) rising for a height of 30 feet, and still keeping its width of about 15 feet \u2014 (a company have leased 25 acres of this) ; again, dipping and crossing Armenian Gully, it shows on Stuart's Hill, where it again appears the same width. This one continued line of reef, being traced for nearly two miles, has in many places been tried, and found to contain gold, and iu some places from 1 to 2 oz. per ton been obtained from it. In the main gully, situate 2 miles N. of St. Arnaud, there are a number of Europeans and Chinamen at work, mostly engaged in puddling; this cully, as before observed, having been very good, has been repeatedly sunk on, and many of the old holes filled up, the depth varying from 10 to 20 feet deep, con sequently the puddlers have to take it from the surface, generally throwing the first 10 feet away, and in some instances puddling the rest, but mostly about 3 feet from the bottom, the yield from which does not average more than 1 dwt. On Wilson's, Sebastopol, and Stuart's Hills this mass is sound to have numerous leaders on either side, and, with the exception of Sebastopol, these leaders are being worked instead of the main reef; those on Stuart's Hill are the richest, 24 oz. per ton being obtained from unpicked stone, this being Messrs. Walker and Company's claim (see ex planation to plan II.); Messrs. Cunninglrame and Company are also working another leader to the east of this reef (see plan II.) ; where this reef appears above the surface as at Sebastopol, it shows along the surface as before mentioned, about 200 sect long; the The ranges on each side of this aud the other main gully abound in reefs but little prospected; in many places where tried gold has been found, but in quantities too small to pay the individual miner; but I have no doubt, when machinery is brought of the same power aud perfection to this district as"], [411, "MINING SUBYEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 AUGUST. 223 in many others, all of these reefs now lying idle will be made to yield a handsome return.

The Fortuna Company are continuing very successful, having, during the two months they have been working to 30th August, raised 248 tons, and realized therefrom 330 oz. 13 dwt. smelted gold. They now em ploy 18 men ; the reef varies in width from 1 foot 6 inches to 3 feet, and was opened to a depth of 100 feet by former holders, both by shafts and a tunnel, so that the present company have simply to break the quartz and run it out by tramway, the shafts serving for ventilation. The company as yet have no machinery, but crush their quartz at the Old Specimen Gully Company's machinery. The prospects of our mining companies are daily becoming more encouraging ; those which have their machinery in working are progressing in the development of the mines, and are destined to become profitable specu lations. The Old Quartz Hill Company's machine is now working, and is as powerful, complete, and compact a plant as any in the colony. I have in previous reports described the reef, &c The machinery just completed comprises a 60 horse-power engine capable of working to 80 horse-power, with two boilers 24 feet by 6 feet 6 inches ; cylinder, 24-inch, 36-inch stroke; fly wheel, 16 feet diameter, at present driving 24 head of stamps, intended to be augmented to 50 head ; self-feeding with 9-inch pumping gear. The Old Specimen Gully Company are steadily progressing, although it has not yet realized the sanguine expectations of its shareholders. The mine continues to be re gularly worked, and prospects improving, the yield from 856 tons quartz raised during past quarter was 332 oz. 2 dwt., giving an average of 7 dwt. 18 gr. per ton, which has been about the average ever since the company started. The amalgamating apparatus is 9 feet by 9 feet ; ripples covered with copper, running thence into Meyerhoff's patent galvanic cradles, in which the oscillating action tends to bring all particles of gold into contact with the copper, and at the discharge of cradles are inclined planes with stops covered with copper. The returns for the past quarter are much improved, but though not sufficiently large to warrant a dividend, the plant at the mine has been improved, old liabilities have been paid off, and many alterations have been made by the management, with a view to economize labor \u2014 which works, together with the cost of sinking the two shafts, have been paid for out of the returns, without intrenching on the capital of the company. Two excellent dams are calculated to con tain six months' supply of water. Not only will this mine and plant bear comparison with any in the colony for com pleteness and durability, but its cost (\u00a34500) may afford a very profitable lesson to many of our public companies, the Old Quartz Hill Company being a private company, held by 14 shareholders, and having a capital of \u00a325,000. The Eureka Company possess an efficient and valuable plant and extensive mine ; but, like most public companies, had the misfor tune to raise the expectations of its proprietary for immediate returns on their capital, which not being realized, caused depression \u2014 but as this mine contains such a mass of quartz, capable of being easily excavated and con veyed to the machinery, must ultimately pay well. The company have crushed 3152 tons since they commenced operations, which has produced 862 oz., teing an average of about 5J dwt. per ton ; and as the machinery has been got into good working order, and the mine well developed, the working expenses will decrease, and doubtless the mine become profitable. The Wattle Gully Company are again in active operation, employing 17 men, and keeping the machinery working night and day crushing top stuff, i. e., refuse quartz, and also the debris thrown out of tne old puddling machines, which pays better than the quartz at present obtainable from the reef. The company's lease includes several acres of alluvial workings, from which the original"], [414, "MINING SUBYEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 AUGUST. 226 The Cumberland Company (as is usually the case in a new start), are meeting with little stoppages, and remedying imperfections in their machinery. They at first adopted the ripple tables, but are not satisfied with the result, and are about to try Meyerhoff 's cradles; they also overrated their subter ranean water supply, not having at present one-third sufficient for working, and having made no provision for supply from surface drainage, their works are much impeded. The draining shaft must apparently be sunk much deeper before it will furnish sufficient fluid for the engine and batteries. The machinery is as follows In former plans and reports I have referred to the alluvial deposits as running to and being derived from quartz reefs ; most of the workings in Forest Creek are of the one cha racter, the out-cropping reefs being the matrix, and all ground falling from thence towards the creek receive deposits there from ; the consequent monotony will be some what relieved as we go through Campbell's Creek. Here, as per plan, there are evidently two or more distinct deposits, 40 to 70 feet sinking and surface workings being intermittent sometimes on the same hills ; the runs of gold and lswer deposits are not traceable to reefs but to made hills, composed principally of water-worn quartz nodules and debris, often cemented together with ferruginous matter, the wash-gravel resting on whitish or yellow felspathic schist \u2014 the cement in many parts yielding from 6 dwt to 2 oz. to the ton, and is being raised and crushed similar to quartz workings. You will observe a great increase in the Chinese population during the month of August, amounting to 800. They have rushed the Loddon Valley from Pennyweight to about half a mile below Guildford (a distance of a mile and balf). From what I am able to gather, they are contenting themselves with small returns; nothing heavy can be expected, as no distinct lead of gold has been discovered ; the gold found is of the smallest possible character I have never before seen such a sample of the precious metal as the one washed out in my presence from a tub of stuff ; it appeared to be about six grains, and 1 may safely state that there were hundreds of specks in that sample, all of a scaly nature. From what I can gather, this is the general quality of the gold found in the rush. It appears to me to con sist of stray waifs from other leads further up the river. However, the Chinese seem content with their prospects, so much so that they are giving fair prices for the land in the locality that is alienated. As a description of ground is only inter esting when accompanying the plans, I write the same on plan instead of in report. Fryer's Creek Division. (R. L. M. Kitto, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 Puddling. \u2014 This branch of mining is being carried on with the greatest activity, the miners making up for the scarcity of gold by long hours and hard work. Water at this season of the year is comparatively abundant, which accounts for the extent of puddling now going on. Tunnelling.\u2014 Table Hill is still the favorite spot.

Several claims have been taken up on Sailor's Hill, Kangaroo Hill, and Bald Hill during the last month. The wash-dirt rn these latter places is very poor, but averages from 4 to 6 feet in thick ness, and owing to the quantity of water at command just now will pay for sluicing, a process that gets through a great quantity of stuff in a short time. Sluicing is very actively carried on in the Loddon, principally by Chinese. . cleaned out can be run into a small Chilian mill erected for the purpose, and worked by the engine. By this process a saving of at least three-fourths of the time ordinarily re quired in cleaning up is effected. The pumping arrangements for supplying the stampers are as good as the position will admit of. The reservoir is 40 feet below the level of the stampers, and water is brought to the latter through a lobby (drive) or adit, and pumped from a shaft sunk on it. The stamp heads are perfectly square, and are keyed on to an iron shaft. These shafts are of a style I have not before seen, and are of first-class workmanship, having been forged at the foundry of Mr. Chambers, Melbourne. Quartz Mining. \u2014 There has been a small rush on a reef known as Higging's, in Cob bler's Gully, during the last month. Several shafts had been previously sunk on it at depths 'varying from 20 to 130 feet, but eventually abandoned. Higging's party ap plied for an extended claim, and from the first crushing got 4J oz. to the ton ; a large yield for this district. Hence the rush. The arrangements for feeding the stampers with mineral are admirable. From a tunnel in the hill, laden trucks are brought by a tramway to the stampers: these are run on a traverse table, which feeds the whole of the six passes (shoots). On the Cemetery Reef, south of the El Dorado, two extended claims have been granted ; the owners are getting a little gold, but of a very fine (small) character. In some of the stones from this reef there is gold which it is impossible to discern with the naked eye, but a powerful microscope showed scores of specks, apparently about the size of the surface of a pin's head. This could all be seen on a stone the surface of which was only about a quarter of an inch square. The Alliance Company. \u2014 This little com pany are progressing steadily, and deriving a small weekly profit. However small the profit may be, the fact is cheering. The Chapel Hill Company is about to be re-organized, under the name of the Excelsior. The Emu Company has become bankrupt. The Cornish and Spanish Reef, which some time since promised to turn out exceed ingly well, is almost entirely abandoned, only two or three parties working on it. Nothing is as yet being done with the Ferrons Reef Company. Accompanying this report, I send you a plan of the Spring Gully gold workings (No. 1). This has been one of the richest portions of the Fryer's Creek Mining Division. It was partially worked and deserted seven years since; it then turned out several hand some fortunes. Some four years and a half ago, it was re-rushed, and again made splendid returns from that time to about two years since. The washdirt or auriferous drift averaged from 4 to 5 feet in thickness. During this working, the gully was literally undermined, and fairly stood on prop3. On the Emu and El Dorado the few private parties working are makiug average wages. The Ferrons Reef has been also the scene of a small rush, in consequence of Pilcher's party having struck a leader which produces 4 oz. to the ton. The gold is of a particu larly coarse kind. Companies. \u2014 Among the companies in the division, the El Dorado stands pre-eminently foremost. Their machinery have had a pre liminary start, and they expect next week to commence in earnest. 1 imagine mining speculation here will rise and fall in propor tion to the success or otherwise of the El Dorado. I stated in my last month's report that the engine was of 60 horse-power; it is of 65 horse-power. The engine and stampers (24 in number) are erected on the most eco nomical principle, but very substantial. The lifting power is somewhat different to ordi nary ones. In most cases, there is an axle to every eight heads; here, however, they have separate axles for every four heads, keyed on the same shaft. As the plan will show you, it is again the scene of very active labors. About forty acres of its area is occupied by puddlers, who are carting out the whole of the alluvial soil to the bed-rock, and puddling it, and are in most instances content with their returns. Most of the dams and waterholes shown on the plan are excavations to the bed-rock. The portions of the gully not occupied by extended claims are either entirely worked out or occupied by miners with the ordinary tub and cradle. The depth of the alluvium \u25a0varies from 15 to 35 feet. There are now fully at woik in the gully 58 puddling machines and 12 horse-pumps. The ripples are on the Bendigo principle, and are fixed in such a position that when C"], [416, "MINING SUBYEYOES' BEPOETS \u2014 AUGUST. 228 The following are the numbers employed Approximate value of all mining plant in the division, \u00a381,000. I have the honor to submit the enclosed report for August, as also tabulated forms as to the yield of gold on the various reefs on the division, which are collected from the books of the proprietors of the crushing machines ; but as regards any information respecting alluvial mining, it is not in my power to say much.

A new reef, or rather vein, called \"Ga briel's Reef,\" has been opened in Doctor's Gully, and 9 tons of surface stone from the prospecting claim yielded upwards of 11 oz. No properly formed reef, however, has as yet been struck, but the locality is very likely, and I doubt not that a good payable reef will ultimately be discovered.

The number of payable claims are not, however, as yet in any proportion to the number of parties prospecting, but those claims where payable gold is being obtained are decidedly good, and I hope ere long to be able to report Yandoit as a more than ordinary flourishing gold field. On New Nug'gety Reef, Connell's Gully. matters remain much the same, the pros pecting claim, as usual, producing first rate stone. The proprietors have lately purchased Messrs. Trimble and Company's machine in Daylesford. The reef in the adjoining claim north (Messrs. Dorrey and Company's lease) varies in the width from one to seven feet, and averages about J oz. to the ton. The engine belonging to said company is kept constantly employed, and works beautifully. The next shaft north is down 105 feet, expecting to strike the reef at about 140 feet. Pioneer Reef, opened in March, by Messrs. Steele and Company, has up till now been marked with splendid results, but only one or two claims besides the prospectors'have as yet struck gold, the average yield of the reef during the month being from 11 to 15 oz. per ton. The rest of the claims, having attained the water level, have suspended operations while making arrangements for the erection of machinery, or have only lately started sinking. Messrs. McDermott and Company's machine is spoken of as likely to be re moved to the ground, which will no doubt be conducive to the benefit both of the miners and proprietors. The want of machinery near the reefs has been, and is still, severely felt. Emu and Adams Reefs are both being prospected, and I have no doubt will this time have a fair trial. Boots Reef, where, on various occasions, good prospects have been obtained, has also lately been taken up by Ballaarat parties, and there is every reason to believe that a syste matic prospect cannot fail to prove the pay able character of the reef. The Dry Diggings Company have crushed about 50 tons from Parker's Specimen Reef, averaging about 12 dwt. per ton, a yield that with machinery of their own would pay ca pitally. The company, I believe, have entered into arrangements for the erection of efficient machinery on the ground. Hamburg Reef, discovered in May, by Messrs. Lodigers, Loost, and Company, has been till now the richest inthedistrict. Taking the whole reef, about 3 feet in width, the aver age has been 5 oz. to 7 oz. per ton. One fourth share in the prospecting claim has lately shifted hands for \u00a31400, and since then \u00a32000 have been offered and refused. Messrs. Ritter and Company, adjoining claim south, struck gold at a depth of 120 feet, obtaining about 5 oz. per ton. They have reserved a lot of picked quartz with a view of having it reduced at the Atlas Association's machine in Tarrangower, of the efficiency of which machinery great things are reported. Note.\u2014 I just learn that 3 tons sent from Ritter's claim to the above machine produced 345 oz. From Beehive Reef Dry Diggings, I have not heard of any crushing, but under stand that the stone, as usual, looks exceed ingly well. In Yandoit I have great satisfaction in being able to report that a decided improve ment in quartz mining has taken place. During the last month a great number of people, principally from Ballaarat and Tarran gower, have continually poured in, probably induced by the splendid yields of Pioneer and Hamburg Reefs, and the division, I trust, will now have the benefit of being pros pected with skill taught by experience, to the want of which I principally attribute the neglected state of our reefs. Formerly each respective party sank separate shafts, and the strike of the reefs being generally 1 in 2, and the length of claim (120 feet) throwing the shafts so far apart, a large amount of labor was in most instances lost, as only sow parties had the necessary means at command to enable them to keep on. Now, however, a co-operative system is beginning to be in troduced in places where the depth of sinking or other natural difficulties is probable to be considerable. A number of claims generally amalgamate, and it is only reasonable to ex pect that all the energies of the claim- Glamorganshire Reef, opened in July.\u2014 This reef appears to be a southern continua tion of Hamburg Reef, and a pretty good prospect has been obtained. No crushing has as yet taken place, but a number ot claims are putting down shafts. Malcolm's Reef (private property) is still regularly paying 4 oz. to 7 oz. per ton, and New German Reef, Cosmopolitan, and Trogish Reefs continue to yield very profitable returns. Besides a great number of new claims being taken up on the above-mentioned reefs, the following new reefs have been opened in August : \u2014 Homeward Bound Reef. \u2014 Two claims A fair prospect has been obtained, but no crushing has as yet taken place."], [421, "MINING SUBVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 AUGUST. 233 Welshman's Reef. \u2014 Seven claims.

Persons long resident in the neighborhood assert that a couple of pounds per week may generally be depended on, and under present circumstances this is by no means despicable. Fisher's Reef. \u2014 Two claims. Spread Eagle Reef. \u2014 Eleven claims. Probably a northern continuation of Ham burg Reef, Eichard's aud Dicky Sam's Reefs, but all are taken up so recently that nothing definite can be said at present. The Hit or Miss Company, having rented a 50-acre paddock, and sinking for the Forty foot Lead, have not yet bottomed in the deep ground ; they have, however, discovered a shallow lead, averaging 1 to lj oz. per load, by 2 to 3 feet of wash-dirt ; and shares, three weeks ago worth about \u00a35, are now up to \u00a3100. To my knowledge, \u00a350 has been paid for one share. Puddling and sluicing remains as usual. The season has been remarkably dry, and unless some heavy showers soon give us a supply of water, a great number of claims will soon be obliged to suspend operations. The average yield throughout the division has not, in my estimation, this season ex ceeded wages, attributable as much to the limited water supply as to any other source. Connell's Gully and neighborhood has this season been unusually quiet, Messrs. Wardle and Company's races only having supplied water for a couple of weeks, a very serious loss to the enterprising owners, a sluicehead being worth about \u00a36 or \u00a37 per week. On the Yandoit Plains, below Dr. Mal colm's property, between Yandoit and Jim Crow Creek, 6000 feet frontage has been taken up by parties intending to procure boring rods to search for the deep ground. and I have great faith in the Forty-foot Lead being again discovered. Accompanying I have the honor to submit Plans No. 2 North and No. 2 North a west, being northern continuation of Plan No. 1, transmitted the 13th May, 1859. Tunnelling. \u2014 No improvement can be said to have been effected in this branch of min ing, but matters remain, as usual, satisfac tory. The average yield, as near as I can ascertain, appears to be \u00a33 to \u00a35 per man per week, aud this must be considered very good returns, when it is considered that a tunnel claim generally lasts for years. Having attained almost the southern boun dary of my division with the last plans sub mitted, and no actual gold workings existing on the line in that direction; and having, by the great influx of people in Yandoit lately, been obliged to bestow more than usual time on the northern part of my division, have caused me to begin a northern continuation of the series of geological plans submitted by me to your honorable Board. Several parties have begun prospecting the basaltic hills between Shepherd's Flat and Yandoit, and I doubt not that good payable ground will be discoverd in that locality. Some of the old tunnels along Bald Hill Creek are again being put in working order, and nearly all the principal basaltic hills are in full operations. For explanation of these plans, I beg to refer you to the following : \u2014 Alluvial Sinking. \u2014 No new ground has been discovered, and the tub and cradle sys tem in the old ground is daily becoming a more precarious means of living. That new good ground will be opened during the next summer I have no doubt ; such has at least been the case each of the preceding summers, when the majority of puddlers and sluicers by want of water were thrown out of em ployment. The alluvial gold workings, shown by a blue color, have not distinguished them selves by extraordinary richness ; but the bed of Jim Crow Creek and adjoining banks have years ago been sluiced, and by that process yielded \u00a36 to \u00a38 per man per week. Most of the ground is still being worked ; and, altogether, Shepherd's Flat looks this season comparatively brisker than any other locality on Jim Crow. The gold workings on both banks of the creek imme diately above the leases (said leases shown by a green color) have only been occupied the last two seasons, aud being systemati cally worked, leave a handsome .nett profit to their owners. In New Nuggety Gully, I have been in formed by Mr. Stevens that his party dis covered a nugget of 32 pounds weight during August ; in fact, this gully appears to be almost inexhaustible, and is, therefore, the principal locality for tub and cradle opera tions about Yandoit, and finds like the above, even if rarely occurring, still tend to keep up the spirit and renew the energies of the rest of the miners. The leases shown on Plan No. la west, and distinguished by a green color, are \u2014 L. No. II.\u2014 Applied for by Messrs. Parker and Company. In Forty-foot, the old lead, for some time almost deserted, is again beginning to be"], [422, "234 MINING SUBVEYOES EEPOETS \u2014 AUGUST. L. No. VII. \u2014 Applied for by Messrs.

On none of these leases active operations have as yet been commenced, but the flats are known to contain gold, holes here and there having been bottomed, and good sluicing prospects obtained ; but the depth of sinking amounting to upwards of 20 feet, and the consequent influx of drift-water necessitating expensive machinery, have, by the individual miner, been considered too serious obstacles as long as easier workable ground was pro curable. This last season, however, patches of comparatively shallow ground (as shown on Plan No. 2a west) have been taken up for sluicing, and there is no doubt that by degrees the gold workings will be extended in that direction. _ I do not think any change has taken place since last month that affects the numbers of the mining population. With a widely spread people of nomadic habits, I can only acquire an approximation to their numbers. Taradale Home-field, Survey Paddock.\u2014 The chief scene of operations during the month of August has keen the Government Reserve adjoining the township on the east, known as the Survey Paddock. The miners have the privilege granted of digging thereon condition that they re-fill the holes after working them out. About 200 men arenowensagedatthisspot; some are said to obtain 4 dwt. of gold from a tub of dirt. The depth of the sinking varies from 6 to 12 feet. There are 70 or 80 acres of diluvial ground that to a large extent is likely to yield gold, as the place inter- venes in connecting the auriferous lead on the Back Creek with the Coliban River, at a part where the banks have already produced much gold. It is along this part of the Coliban where the Chinese have worked of late. These Chinese have suffered considerably from the effect of floods, which have washed away several dams that they had constructed to turn the course of the river. Many of them have relinquished their claims here, and are now working on the old wrought ground about the township. Taradale to the East ward.\u2014 Victoria Gully, which lies a mile east of the township, it seems i3 nearly worked out, as not above 50 miners are employed there at present. Two other small gullies have been opened, situate between Victoria Gully and the river, the depth of sinking being from 8 to 15 feet. About 50 men are occupied here. A nugget, with a little quartz attached, has lately been found somewhere hereabout which weighed 51 oz., but its exact locale has not been divulged. The reefs lately discovered on this eastern side of the Coliban River, and which I men tioned in my last report, are in four claims, The basaltic hills on these plans (shown by a brown color) have all to a certain extent been prospected by tunnels, and gold obtained ; but none of the tunnels have been driven any considerable distance, and no definite main lead or gutter been discovered, and therefore the ground lies idle until some of the old discovered leads have been worked out, when, I am confident, that this locality will be thoroughly tested. The general impres sion seems to be that the terrain is too flat to make the existence of a defined lead pro bable ; but it appears to me to be evident that the Elevated Plains Lead, one of the best in the division, cannot fail to continue its course in that direction, and I am per suaded that my predictions will, at some future period, be found to hold good.

The richest vein, which is in the prospectors' claim, is diminishing as it descends, and in no part does it exceed 10 inches in thickness. This reef has been named the Victoria. Its strike bears north and south, it dips to the east at an angle of 22J degrees from the perpendicular. The other reef, contiguous to the former, has its strike north 73 degrees east, with a consider able dip to the south. This has been named the Ashtonian.

One lump of stone weighing 6\u00a3 oz. yielded 4 oz. of gold. Other patches of coarse gold were found, but inferior to the one above stated. St. Andrew's Division. Although there be no alluvial diggings as yet, it will be anomalous if no auriferous drifts exist in the valleys contiguous to these out-cropping golden reefs. The denudation here appears to have been equally great with that of other similar regions; but the fact is, that the miners have not sufficiently tested the country to prove the point.

Prospecting Parties. \u2014 An association has been organized for carrying out this object, to discover new fields for the miners; local subscriptions have been liberally advanced for the last four weeks, and a grant of money having been obtained from the Government, the committee of management have put on twenty-four men to prospect the surrounding country.

It affords me great pleasure to be able to inform you that in this division mining matters have been improving very much during the past month. A reference to the foregoing tables will show what may, in this division, be considered a very great increase in the number of both quartz and alluvial miners ; but from the state of alluvial mining generally, and the facilities about to be af forded to the quartz miners in the way of cheap and efficient crushing and extraction of gold from quartz, I feel bound to believe that within a very short period a very con siderable number of those employed at allu vial mining will turn their attention to the more certain and more remunerative pursuit of quartz mining. many new reefs will be discovered by means of these two tunnels that in all probability would never be discovered by prospecting this hill by shafts. I am happy to be able to state, that on the whole quartz mining iu this division is beginning to assume a more business-like form : hitherto the miners in this division would make a dash at a quartz reef with the expectation of finding a sudden fortune within a few feet of the surface, and failing in their expectations, they would abandon their claims ; hence, the great num ber of abandoned reefs. However, they are now beginning to reconcile themselves to the reality of two or three ounces to the ton ; and to calculate that, with even a less yield and crushing at, say 15s. a ton ; the poverty that now exists on this gold field would bo unknown. 'Ihe erection of new and very powerful machinery at Salter's rush by Messrs. Holmes aud Company is causing quite a stir amongst the miners on the Caledonian gold field, and as it is sard that the price of crushingis to be 15s. per ton many of the alluvial miners are already looking about for quartz claims. Another quartz crushing machine is about to be erected at Smyth's Creek by the same company, for the purpose of crushing all the quartz raised on One-tree Hill, where there are many piles of quartz that will pay with cheap crushing, but are no better than deads at present, as the price of crushing is \u00a32 per ton. I must, however, do some of the miners here the justice to say, that paying the ex orbitant rate of \u00a34 per ton for crushing was the cause of their giving up quartz mining, and not a want of perseverance with moderate expectations. With reference to alluvial mining, the only thing worth noting is the finding of a nugget weighing 32 oz. 0 dwt. 12 grs. in the upper part of Happy Valley or Fern-tree Gully, a plan of which I have sent in some months ago ; there were also some very good patches of shotty gold and small nuggets found in the vicinity of this nugget. The finders, however, have since given up their claims and turned to quartz mining. Neither the Yarra Yarra Gold Washing Company nor the Yarra Yarra Steam Pud dling Company have yet recommenced their operations; probably they are waiting for the dry weather to set in, as rainy weather makes it difficult to work the claims be longing to these companies. The tunnel which I reported as being driven by Messrs. Shotton and party at the Yow Yow Hill has since my last report passed into the ownership of Messrs. Holmes, Handle and Company, and is now driven to a distance of nearly 400 feet, that is 320 feet of tunnel driven and timbered in one month. Another tunnel is on the eve of being commenced by the recently formed Yow Yow Hill Mining Company, for the purpose of working part of Gillman's Reef, on the Yow Yow, and open ing up whatever reefs are in the north side of the hill.

Campbell's Gully. \u2014 Mining in this locality is progressing very favorably ; the gully generally presents an appearance of pros perity; the workings consist of surfacing and shallow sinking; several of the parties have constructed large dams, and the late heavy rains have given them an ample supply of water, which is very necessary in this descrip tion of mining, so that they are now enabled profitably to rework ground which had been abandoned as unremunerative.

Opossum Gully.\u2014 I regret to say that this gully is almost deserted, I may say without having been tested ; it is true that several shafts were sunk without discovering gold while in others it was found in such small quantities as would not induce the miners to persevere, but still I am far from being of opinion that the locality has been tested, and indeed I have no hesitation in saying that had tire claims been smaller a very great many more shafts would have been sunk aud I be lieve remunerative ground would have been opened up I also regret to say that the quartz reefs, of which outcrops are visible on several ofthe hills, remain entirelyuntouclied. The Leads. \u2014 Suburban Lead. \u2014 The Essex Company are at present busily engaged, and there is every reason to believe that their claim will prove a very valuable one. A new company is being formed for the purpose of mining a portion of this lead which passes under private property. The Swamp Lead. \u2014 The Black Diamond Company are still persevering, but I regret to say that up to the present they have met with very little success. The Durham Company have suspended mining operations and are engaged in re-modelling the company with a view to increase their capital aud limit their liability. Inkermanu Lead. \u2014 The Allied Armies Company has recently been re-modelled, it having been found that the remaining por tion of the claim was not sufficiently rich to remunerate so large a company ; it was pro posed either that the sleeping shareholders should purchase out the working share holders or that the working shareholders should purchase out the sleeping share holders; accordingly the sleeping shareholders were bought out, and it is expected that with the reduced number of shareholders the claim shaft. This is the last company upon Crown lands which has sound the gutter, and con siderable anxiety is evinced as to its course. Judging from present indications it is probable that the Tannery Company will be great suf ferers on account of the direction taken by the gutter; it was thought that it would have passed under, or nearly under Sturt street and between the shafts of the Tannery and South ern Cross Companies, but from the fact of the Tannery Company's drives having been con tinued in the bed rock for so great a distance towards the Southern Cross Company's claim without having discovered any indications of deep ground, and from the Southern Cross Company having bottomed their shaft on tho reef about 100 feet too shallow, it may be re garded almost as a fact that the lead passes to the northward of the Southern Cross Com pany's shaft. The Golden Point Lead. \u2014 The Cosmopoli tan Company are doing exceedingly well, and there is every reason to believe that, owing to the extent of their claims and the adoption from time to time of improvements in the mode of working and iu the appliances neces sary in the mining of deep leads, this com pany and others of a similar character will be handsomely repaid for the enormous expendi ture of capital and labor required in sinking shafts aud driving levels in search of the gutter. The Koh-i-nor Company has been swamped out again, before they had fairly recovered from the influx of water mentioned in my last report; however, it is expected that when they shall have completed the works upon which they have for some time past been engaged, viz., the sinking of their shaft deeper and putting in of a main level at a greater dspth, they will be able to overcome with comparative ease any mishap of a like nature which may in future occur to them. It is a serious loss to the district for such a company as this to be stopped. The Nightingale Lead. \u2014 The Great Western Company, the only one at work upon this lead, is doing moderately well. The Malakhoff Lead.\u2014 The Triumphant Compauy are doing well, their average divi dends being about ten pounds (\u00a3 10) per share per week. The British Company is working on the reef with only moderate success. The Great Eastern Company is still at work. The law suit which has been so long pending be tween the sleeping and working members of this company has recently been determined by a decision in favor of the sleeping mem bers. It is expected that a remunerative quartz reef will be opened up in this claim. Milkmaid's Lead. \u2014 The Burra Burra Com pany are still at work upon their alluvial claim, and in addition thereto are making preparations for working the quartz reef which passes through their ground ; this will yield tolerable wages for some time to eome. The Independent Company has worked out and abandoned their claim. The Opbir Comp my has nearly worked out. The Great Republic Company have recovered from the effects of the late swamping out and have now fairly recommenced their mining opera tions; they have had a very long and expen sive job in cleaning out and repairing their extensive drives ; I have reason to believe that they will take every precaution to guard, as far as practicable, against a recur rence. The Hand-in-Hand Company are still sol lowing up the course of the lead, and with tolerable success, considering the enormous expense which attends their works, owing to the great distance of the gutter from their"], [429, "MINING STJEVEYOES* BEPOETS \u2014 SEPTEMBEE. 239 reef, from its sizo and from the prospects already obtained, promises to give them highly remunerative employment for a great length of time.

During the month of September, the rush to quartz most sensibly abated. The rush to Yandoit has certainly caused many of the miners of this district to migrate ; but the real cause of this abatement proceeds from the wild system of speculation so prevalent here a few months ago. Frenchman's Lead \u2014 The Albion Company are still engaged in driving for the gutter ; the bed-rock continues soft, and leads them to believe that they are in the vicinity of deep ground. Quartz. \u2014 The Township Company's claim and plant have recently been sold for the benefit of the company's creditors, and have been purchased by a capitalist on Ballaarat, who, it is said, intends to work the claim. The several prospecting parties which started a short time since have suspended operations, the want of capital being in nearly every case the cause of suspension. I enclose herewith a tracing of the plan of the leads by which you will perceive the progress of the workings of the various gut ters up to the present time. The courses of the two main gutters, viz., the Golden Point and the Inkermann, continue to be almost parallel to each other. The Suburban and Swamp Leads and other tributaries must ul timately fall into the Inkermann upon one side of tbe dividing reef, and the Miner's Right, Redan, and trbutaries into the Golden Point on the other side. The matter of the junction of the Golden Point and Inkermann Leads is, to my mind, full of interest, and is well worthy of close scientific investigation. Almost every miner, in the early days of the rush, indulged in as many shares as his miner's right could entitle him to, and the result was, that each took more shares than he could work. These shares were, for the most part, taken up with the view of being sold to others who were less early in the field ; and as many of them were not sold, and the holders thereof could not pay the current expenses, the result is, at present, the dissolution of the majority of the new mining companies. I would have no doubt of the ultimate success of most of the lately estab lished companies on Ballaarat, if they were composed of men of sufficient capital ; but, unfortunately, there are very few working miners on this gold field sufficiently indepen dent to meet the necessary expenses to be incurred by perhaps twelve months' prospect ing; and hence many of our quartz reefs must still remain untried. But, despite the reported riches of Yandoit, and the poverty of the mining community here, I am happy to say that very few of the companies which have persevered have any cause to regret their enterprise. The All Nations Company, near Dead Horse Gully, is a signal instance of this spirit. This company have prospected un ceasingly for the last sixteen months in a neighborhood hitherto untouched, and after expending upwards of \u00a31,800 iu labor and material, their efforts have been deservedly crowned with success. In their sixth shaft they struck a reef which they consider will yield at least one ounce per ton. This instance may serve as an example to others, and indeed many are taking advantage of tbe enterprise of the All Nations Company, and are securing claims north and south of the successful claim.

On the Yorkshire Reef the miners com posing the Yorkshire Company are preparing to erect machinery, being satisfied with the quality of their quartz. Their neighbors, the West Riding Company, are now sinking a permanent shaft, and are also looking out for machinery. This company being composed of working shareholders are sanguine as to their future prospects, though their quartz did not yield much more than 5 dwt. per ton. are the All Nations, the Prince of Wales, and the Enterprise, of which I can report nothing favorable this mouth. The Victoria Com pany, on the Victoria Reef, eastward of the Enterprise, obtained 26 oz. 12 dwt. from 28 tons of quartz, taken from a vein 6 feet wide and 60 feet from the surface. Having sank deeper they opened a level at the depth of 95 feet, but instead of finding a large block of quartz, as they expected, they sound that the reef had run into numerous small veins, averaging not more than a soot thick. This occurs frequently in this district, and there are many reefs which, at or near the surface, have a width of 20 or 30 feet, at a depth of 100 feet or more are almost completely lost. On the contrary, when the reef appears small on the cap, and of wedge-like shape, there is every appearance of its increasing in bulk as it descends. Adjoining this claim is that held by the Nil Desperandum Company. This company is composed of 42 shareholders, holding 170 shares. I have no doubt that each share holder in this company is the proprietor of at least twenty shares in different companies, an instance of the extraordinary development of the acquisitive organ among the miners of this district. This company is I am afraid on the road to dissolution, and the cause is that the shareholders hold so many shares, and being unable to pay the calls due to the different companies, they are of course com pelled to abandon some, or let them remain in abeyance, in the hope of acquiring remu nerative returns from others. I may say the same of the Golden Fleece, the Cynosure, the Northern, the New Northern, the Red Jacket, and others in the vicinity. The Monte Christo presents somewhat of the character of the Black Hill, having no really defined reef, but showing numerous large leaders on and near the surface, which become gradually smaller as they descend. The prospects of this company begin to look brighter, and some very rich specimens have been lately discovered, but whether these prospects are likely to continue is a question that remains to be proved. Many quartz claims are now held in re serve for want of capital, and this is likely to be the case if the miners adhere to the prin ciple of taking more shares than they are able to work. Little Bendigo presents a much better ap pearance ; the prospects on the Band of Hope Reef are satisfactory, and the quartz appears to increase iu value as the miners sink. Un fortunately there are few amongst us who understand the system of erecting efficient amalgamating machinery, and the loss occa sioned thereby is not inconsiderable. The result of a crushing from the One and All Company's Claim (Band of Hope Reef) at the Monte Christo machinery was 21 oz. 4 dwt. from 24 tons; while, in the first essay of their own machinery, quartz of apparently the same value was crushed, and yielded little more than 5 dwt. per ton, and a large quan tity of amalgam was collected at a distance of fifty yards from the site of the machinery. Taking the run of this reef through ten claims, its course from No. 1 Claim to No. 10 is about N. 0\u00b0 15' W., hut it veers considerably from one claim to another, taking a serpentine course, so that if the run of the reef were taken from No. 1 to No. 2 shaft, its course would be about 9 degrees east of north, aud from No. 2 to No. 3 shaft there is probably the same angle west of north. This is not the only instance I have observed of the zigzag course of the reefs in this district, but of the others I cannot speak with confidence. Alluvial workings are still carried on very quietly. Now and then a small rush takes place, which engages 40 or 50 miners, but the ground being shallow, is worked out in a short time, and left to be fossicked by the Chinese, and very frequently the Chinese have the best of it. I have been unable to send any plans or sections for this month, but from the decrease of duties, I imagine I shall be able to prepare some for the next month. No. 3 Division.

The condemnation by one company of any system of amalgamation is absolutely worth nothing, as a proof of the worthlessness of that system ; and hence arises the necessity of an exact account being kept by all compa nies at work, in order to obtain sufficient evidence to pronounce upon the many methods of amalgamation now being employed. As an illustration of what I have said, I may mention that during the last month con siderable surprise was created by the discovery made by the Cornish United Company, that the deep copper ripples employed by them were saving far less gold than the shaking tables, against which they were tried. Indeed, so great was the quantity lost, that if the instance was to be taken as a decisive one, copper ripples would be better entitled to the name of gold-losing than gold-saving machines. Five in course of erection. 1 beg to forward you my report for the month of October, together with table, show ing the quantity of machinery and number of miners in my district, also sections of the Association, Navie Jack's, and Gay's Leads. By reference to the tables it will be seen that there is but a slight increase in the number of persons engaged in mining, though there is an addition to the steam-power em ployed. As many companies on Ballaarat are now using the ripples in question, the statementby the Cornish United Company caused a great deal of attention to be given to the subject, the result being the production of facts con tradictory to the results obtained by tbe com pany named. Several companies stated that they had employed those ripples for a long time, and after testing their tailings tho roughly, were perfectly satisfied that no appreciable quantity of gold was lost. These facts serve to show the difficulty met with in endeavoring to determine the relative merits of the different machines, and the desirability of exact accounts being kept of all experiments made. There can be no doubt that ripples are superior to shaking-tables, as they require no steam-power to work, and are free from lia bility to breakage. In an economical point of view, therefore, the discovery of an effcient method of saving gold by means of ripples is a great consideration. The increase in machinery shows the greater confidence that is being gained in the remunerative character of our quartz lodes, as stamping batteries are seldom or never erected without trial crushings having been made. One of the batteries in course of erection is to be employed in crushing the cement found on the Eureka Lead and some of iti; tribu taries, which there is every reason to suppose will yield a profitable return. In a former report I mentioned the great difficulty that was experienced by our quartz miners in finding a satisfactory system of saving gold, and the discordance of the opinions expressed by even men of great expe - rience in quartz crushing. The desirability of instituting a series of experiments has often been pointed out, as by this means the rela tive advantages of the various methods might be determined. I regret to repoit that no such series of experiments has yet been made, though some of the mining companies have tried various methods in the carrying on of their operations. In alluvial mining there is but little change since my last report, with the exception that some few steam puddling machines are in course of erection. The abundant supply of water obtained from the late heavy rains has enabled all the companies to keep steadily at work.

The Hopeweli Company, also on the side of the Canadian Range have a battery of 8 stamps. The last crushing gave 30 oz. of gold to one week's work. This company have a claim on the lodes which cross from the Golden Point Range to Black Hill, and though they have made no trial crushings themselves, the average yield obtained by the company west to them has induced them to put up machinery forth with.

The population is as follows : \u2014 Now, however, that the old alluvial ground in the district is nearly exhausted, and that the majority of the quartz claims in work are found to yield remunerative wages, there appears to be a very general disposition to engage in the more permanent and profitable department of quartz mining, in proof of which I may mention, that during the month of September some five or six quartz pros pecting claims have been taken up in the district lying between Italian and Paddy's Gullies ; but a3 it may be several months before anything definite will be known as to results, very probably the growth or intro duction of quartz mining in my division will progress but slowly, aud be a work of time. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Since my last report the Germanic Con federation Company's claim at Pinchgut has fallen into the hands of a new company, known as the \"Australian Quartz Mining Company,\" who have recently applied for a lease of tbe ground, and who moreover have reason to be satisfied that they will obtain very good interest, if nothing more, for their outlay in purchasing the claim, plant, &c. of the original company. I believe the new company have paid or engaged to pay about \u00a32300 liabilities that were due by the old company, and have thus released them from a debt which themselves were unable to liquidate, and which most likely would be far in excess of what the claim and plant would realize if sold at auction by the creditors. Since the transfer a trial crushing has been made by the present company which produced nearly 10 dwt. per ton, and as firewood is abundant on the claim, and the reef of tolerable width, (about 2J or 3 feet), it is expected this yield, should it continue, will pay the present shareholders upwards of 200 per centum per annum for their outlay.

Whim Holes.\u2014 I am sorry to say mining affairs here have presented a very dull aspect this time back. The Progressive Company, whom I may call the prospectors of the dis trict, have been obliged to discontinue work some five or six weeks since on account of the unexpected delay, expense, and difficulties experienced both in sinking the shaft and driving for the gutter, and the consequent inability or disinclination on the part of the majority of the shareholders to pay up their calls or continue operations. The affairs of the company are about being wound up at the next sitting of the Court of Mines, and after that needful ordeal is got through most probably a new company will be formed for the purpose of thoroughly testing or prospect ing the ground, regarding the auriferous nature of which as matters presently stand, nothing has as yet been proved further than was known at the formation of the company some fourteen months ago. The Heart and Hand Company higher up the lead have been latterly meeting with but indifferent success; it appears the alluvium in their claim will scarcely afford bare subsistence for the work ing, but the shareholders are sanguine that had they crushing apparatus on the ground they could obtain very satisfactory dividends from the large quantity of cement that over lies the alluvium or wash-dirt. However, like their \"Progressive\" neighbors, the great want with them is, I am sorry to say, much too general all over the division, namely, want of the necessary funds to prosecute mining adventures thoroughly or energeti cally. Still higher up the lead, or gully, towards the Little Hard Hills some few \" old ground \" parties here and there are just managing to obtain a \" living.\" The same may be said, with perhaps one or two favor able exceptions, of some 60 or 70 miners employed between the Little Hard Hills and Jackson's, Hockey's, and Sawpit Gullies; in fact, the majority are only fossicking among old ground, from which, if they can obtain about \u00a32 per week per man they appear quite satisfied, and as things nowa days go so they should be, for I feel certain the great bulk of the miners above referred to have not been realizing even 30s. per week per man during the last nine or ten months. Cobler's Lead. \u2014 One of the three companies engaged on this lead has recently dissolved partnership, having wrought out the claim; and taking into account the great amount of preliminary or dead labor expended before tho gutter was reached, the aggregate yield was not remunerative, though the quantity and quality of the wash-dirt might be considered about mediocre. The two remaining companies are engaged, one driving for the gutter, the other (the Prince of Wales Company consisting of 64 shareholders, who hold a claim some 4600 feet long) has been into some sort of slightly auriferous ground during the last three or four months, but owing to the large area over which the gold is interspersed, the washing stuff hitherto met with has been very poor indeed, in fact it scarcely pays mere wages for the time being ; the company, however, are in expectation that they have not yet reached or discovered the deep ground or gutter, and that when they do the quality of the wash-dirt will improve, in which expecta tion I trust they will not be disappointed, as the company have evinced the most deserving and praiseworthy industry and perseverance since commencing operations four years ago. One thing at all events is clear, that the description and general appearance of the wash-dirt in their claim is quite dissimilar to the stuff found in the other claims on the lead ; which fact leads many to suppose that the deep leads in the immediate vicinity of Ballaarat are trending Cobbler's wise, and that probably there is a junction of Cobler's Lead with them somewhere about the shaft Deep Leads. \u2014 There is nothing especial to report of the deep leads in my division. The dispute between the Round Tower aud Red Jacket Companies, on Frenchman's and White Horse Leads, alluded to in my report for July, has been brought to a close on Friday last in the Court of Mines by His Honor deciding that the proceeds of the after-junction or"], [435, "MINING SUBVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 SEPTEMBEE. 245 of this company. However this may be it is as yet premature to venture anythirrg beyond a mere surmise, though in all probability, a few more months will throw much light on the matter, as by that time the outside or most advanced companies on Golden Point, Redan and Frenchman's Leads, will have pro gressed so far with their operations as to be able to furnish the necessary data for the solution of the much agitated question \u2014 What shall be the future course or trend of the deep leads of Ballaarat ? without any material alterations in the work ings. I may mention that the Pioneer Com pany, on the Durham Lead, after four years constant work, have not yet got into the gutter, but have proved the existence of deep ground by boring. A quartz vein has been discovered in the face of the main drive about 20 feet in width, and although no trial of the yield has been made, there is every appear ance of it being highly auriferous. Of other companies on this lead, there is nothing of consequence to report. During the month a party of prospectors has taken up a large claim on the Black Lead Flat, in hopes of discovering a lead running from the Long Gully Ranges to the Black Lead, and from the fact that a run of deep ground has been traced from the ranges for a considerable distance in the direction of this claim, every hope of success is entertained by the prospectors.

The population is as follows: \u2014 Quartz Mining. \u2014 The companies formerly alluded in my reports are still prosecuting their search after the various reefs for which they are registered. The Imperial Company on Hiscock's Reef is raising and crushing at the rate of 150 tons per week, with a fair average yield. Out of 300 tons crushed during the last fortnight, 100 oz. of gold was obtained. By reference to the accompanying plan, it will be seen that the parallels laid off, defining the respective claims on the Napoleon and Franklyn Leads, would, if extended, overlap. The reason of this unfortunate occurrence is that, at the time the Napoleon parallels were fixed for that lead, a protection claim for prospecting was held by the Franklyn Com pany; and, without making a breach of the Mining Bye-laws, I could not extend the parallels so as to interfere with existing rights. Twelve months afterwards a gutter has been discovered within the boundaries of the prospecting claim, which will, in all pro bality, prove a continuation of the Napoleon Lead, but the shareholders being entitled to an extra allowance of grouud for prospecting, the boundaries, if fixed according to that allowance, would include ground previously granted to another company, and at present in occupation. For the reasons above ex plained I have refused to register the second party for rights legally obtained and held by the first. The consequence is that a lawsuit between the two companies has commenced, on the plea that tbe allowance of ground under the present regulations is not given, and that an encroachment by the first occu pants exists upon ground laid off a year sub sequent.

The Havilah Lead is not paying so well as at the beginning ; another party has, how ever, bottomed with a fair prospect. On Banjo Lead, at Mopoke, Looby and party of four men have, from the 20th August to the 3rd October, washed with only the ordinary tubs and cradle 142 oz., besides having raised a quantity of headings which will average in a puddling machine half an ounce to the load. All the other parties at this place having good claims are Chinamen or Malays, from whom no reliable information can be obtained. A large quantity of rain has fallen, and set all the sluicing companies at work ; unfor tunately the flood was so great as to carry off a number of the dams on Slaty and Back Creeks, especially the dam of the Humbug Hill Company, which was full for the first time ; these disasters are chiefly caused through the bye-wash not being left suf ficiently large, and also close up to the breast of the dam, which has then to bear the force of the current as well as the weight of the water.

The Hard Hill Crushing Company are now working the cement in their claim, 60 tons of which yielded half an oz. to the ton ; this company have crushed through the month 440 tons of tailings and cement; the yield 110 oz., or quarter of an ounce to the ton. The new grouud reported in last month as opened at Graham's Hill, Long Point, con tinues to pay well; five more claims have been bottomed during this month ; from the bottom of one of these (Holschier and patty's), 5 oz. was taken, and the four others have all payable claims.

Clunes Mining.\u2014 Just as I had prepared a brief report of the workings in this portion of my district, my attention was called to a serious eruption of water from the bed of the creek, on the 5th instant, into the drives of the Clunes United Company and through their mine to the Clunes Company's work ings, which latter company the accident has more seriously injured. At the first intima tion of the mal-occurrence I visited the spot, but was unable to inspect the claim of the United Miners, to ascertain the cause. It appears that the ground fell in very suddenly, making a report of such a nature as to alarm near residents. I believe it to have been caused by the water percolating down and through the debris silled or washed into an old shaft, sunk more than three years since, which caused the whole to fall, and thereby admitted the water flowing down the creek. I hear it stated, however, that my instruc tions to leave a certain body of quartz in, as a support to the surface, have not been com plied with, but at this time it is impossible to learn the fact. After the miners of this place had temporarily turned the bed of the creek, by making a sand bag dam and cutting, the cavity was filled with bags of sand and quartz tailings; bags of sand were also laid around and on the top of the earth filled into the hole which may now be considered as secured. 1 regret that much loss has been imposed upon the Clunes Company; the south portion of their mine on the eastern reef has fallen in from the surface, and the lower level of the workings will be likely to be filled up; they have 100 feet of water in the mine, and the damage done cannot now be stated. Clunes Company. \u2014 There is nothing new to mention of the workings of this company, except that they have put down a shaft 150 feet near to the No, 1 alluvial shaft, and by a drive of 45 feet have cut the Welcome Reef, which is here three feet wide. The quartz looks very good, but has not been tested. Robinson's Reef still continues to be 30 feet; it has proved this width for over 80 feet along the lode, which is still strong. The levels on the Eastern Reef are not being extended, but the stone is being stoped down. Criterion Company, Robinson's Reef, is now found here also to be 30 feet wide ; heretofore it has been considered but 12 to 16 feet in width, owing to a division of slate, which assumes the appearance of a casing, inter secting the reef in its course. They are now working the whole of the lode and heavily timbering the ground, and filling up the worked out portion to secure the mine. The quantity crushed from September 8th to October 6th was 594 tons, yield 359 oz. 6 dwt. at per ton 12 dwt. 2 gr. Owing to the accident mentioned, the company have filled up their south shaft to keep back the water. Clunes United Company have been pre paring to open out deeper, and fixing neces sary gear on the top for raising the stone. The poppet heads over their new main shaft, are over fifty feet in the clear. The new engine is fairly fixed ; they have a stone and brick chimney nearly 60 feet high. Quantity of quartz crushed very inconsiderable during the past month. To avoid a possible recurrence, the Clunes Company have filled up the shafts on their southern boundary and intend to erect stiong dams in the drives as soon as possible to cut off the heretofore communication. Owing to early intimation of danger and the active measures adopted, a more serious result was prevented, as the whole of the quartz mines northward were at one time imperilled, all have suffered by an extra influx of water The Clunes Company are reducing the water in their mine by their two engines, the one pumping and the other by lifts of 80 gallons per minute with canvas buckets. The Clunes United Company's drives are choked with the debris washed down and by the fall of the surface. Yankee Company are opening a chamber in the lower level of their new main shaft. They have had iron lifters fitted to their battery, which have, as elsewhere proved, an advantage over the wooden lifters. The last week they crushed 121 tons with eight heads of stamps, hitherto the average has been 100 tons per week. Yield still continues to approach nearly 2 oz. pel ton. The com pany have not yet proved a junction of the reefs worked by them and the Victoria Com pany, as was anticipated. Victoria Company. \u2014 In my last I stated that their more easterly lode had a bearing of 25\u00b0 east of north; subsequently it has deviated to 49\u00b0 east, but almost suddenly resuming a course of 15\u00b0 east of north. They have started their battery ; the last week's crushing of 107 tons gave 23 dwt. per ton, nearly. The lode worked by the Yankee Company (with whom it is still rich) called the Eastern, is not so auriferous as the Port Phillip Company during the four weeks ending September 5th have crushed 2374 tons, which yielded 1369 oz. 15 dwt.; average person, 11 dwt. 13 gr.

Going north, this reef, which has been traced from the Clunes Company, breaks into leaders. Although these two bands of quartz differ so considerably in their underlay (as already described) they may yet be one and the same, and prove here a more extensive break and deviation than before experienced with this reef (Eastern). The east lode is heavy, and the stone looks better going towards Esmond's claim northwards. they have driven through the reef at a depth of 38 feet, and find that it has increased at this depth to a width of 30 feet ; but so little has been done to develope it, that I cannot give any opinion as to its gold-bearing quality. They expect to begin operations fully during the present month, when the prospects of the company will be ascertained. The Mount Hope and Jane Hope Companies have not been working during the month, but it is expected they will soon resume operations. The Kangaroo Company have driven in from a new shaft of 100 feet deep on Hicks's Reef, and found it to be 14 inches thick; it looks well, but they have not taken out any quartz, as they intend sinking au additional 50 feet before opening the works. On the Kangaroo and Peterson's Reefs, within the company's ground, they have not been doing anything lately. Alliance Company are making preparations to put down a new main shaft to better prove their claim. Alluvial mining. \u2014 The Young Sons of Free dom, are dividing from \u00a34 to \u00a36 per man a week ; they intend to test the crushing and amalgamating of their wash-dirt. Spe cimens of gold in quartz are frequently found by the party. Should the result prove favor able, they will erect a battery of stampers and discard their puddling apparatus. Great Eastern Company, Opossum Reef, have had 20 tons taken out from a depth of 35 feet, which they are having crushed at the Mount Hope Company's machine, the result of which will determine their future pro ceedings. The reef is 3 feet thick. Southern Lights Company, and the John Bull Company, are earning from \u00a33 to \u00a35 weekly per man. Dam. \u2014 The late floods have satisfactorily tested the strength of the large dam here. Mount Egerton. \u2014 Rose Company, Little Hill Reef, have not yet completed the erection of their machinery. They are taking out quartz, and will have a large quantity raised when machine is ready. The reef in which they are now working has not been mined in before ; the strike is east and west, the dip vertical. : at 30 feet from the surface it unites with another reef striking tbe same way, with a dip of 70 degrees ; the latter was found on the surface, making the position of both reefs like an inverted the former reef is 6 feet thick, the latter from 6 to 16 feet.

Of the ten public and private companies on Steiglitz, who hold land either on lease or application, three only since in possession have obtained gold. Of these the Gibraltar and the Sailor's Reef Company never have been in permanent working order, but have proceeded with a make-shift apparatus, in the hope that their too limited capital might by fortune be aided to euter on operations of a more efficient character. In this they are disappointed. The Gibraltar Company has through the past month remained idle ; the whole original capital and \u00a3700 additional obligations have been expended ; they now purpose disposing of their lease and plant, for which they have had an offer, to start a new company. The No. 3 shaft is considerably lower down the gully, and expect to bottom at 120 feet. In the West Gully there are sour claims being worked. In one of the claims they have found paying washdirt on a false bottom, com posed of pipe clay and yellow marl, at a depth of 24 feet. The slate rock is 38 feet deep, the width of the gutter is 7 feet, and the thickness of wash-dirt from 4 inches to 3 feet ; I cannot supply you with the average yield, but as much as \u00a3 oz. has been washed from one tub. The parties who were sluicing the alluvial deposit on the banks of the Werribee River have ceased work. They state that the gold is so generally distributed that they could make it pay them by sluicing. If large quantities could be put through by steam puddling machines, a large extent of ground could be found to pay. The Sailor's Reef Company have ceased the further extraction of quartz until they make arrangements to work tbe ground in a more efficient manner. The Albion Company have had another crushing, and with first-rate results\u2014 10 oz. per ton. All the operations of this company are of a permanent and efficient character, the only drawback being there is no crushing machinery at present within their reach to extract and collect their gold so speedily and cheaply as the general interests of the com pany require. This drawback will, however, be soon remedied, as an efficient plant, under experienced management, is in the course of erection by Messrs Pyke and French, of the New Chum Reef Company. One steam crushing machine has been re moved to Cantwell's Creek to re-crush quartz tailings, the quartz having been taken there from Mount Egerton three years ago. The tailings are coarse, and a quantity of quick silver is found in them. It is expected they will average 6 dwt. per ton. Steiglitz Division. (T. Woolgrove, Mining Surveyor.) The ground so long held by the Invincibles Company, along with claim known as the Allies claim, has been taken possession of, and a lease of 700 yards applied for, under the title of the Morning Star Company. This is most valuable ground, and the parties now in possession are all practical miners, with the command of large and efficient machinery. This company is an additional improvement in the prospects of Steiglitz. The population is as follows : \u2014 Alluvial miners : \u2014 Morrison's, Tea-tree Creek, and Dolly's Creek 650 Quartz miners : \u2014 Steiglitz 200 850 Messrs Pyke and French, New Chum Eeef Company, continue their preparatory opera tions during the erection of their crushing machinery, carting the stored tailings and quartz raised from their claim and depositing them ou the ground adjoining the crushing works.

The manager has been much misled by the representations of those who had abandoned the ground previous to the company taking possession. Notwithstand ing the tedious, and in many cases unavoid able delays, this company's prospects are encouraging; their mining operations are all of a substantial nature for durability and practical use, and must speedily yield a handsome dividend on the amount of capital already invested in their mining operations. block of quartz, 90 x 100, in the upper ground ; this they are at present engaged on, This claim has never yielded large returns, but tbe steady perseverance of the company has done for them what fortune has carelessly thrown to others. The extension of Italian Reef has been discovered south of the original ground, on the rise with and parallel to Boxing Reef. Gold iu small quantities is to be seen in the quartz, but it has not yet been tested suffi ciently to establish its character. The Cosmopolite Company have made their appearance on the ground held by them at last, but nothing beyond an old hand wind lass and rope, attended by two men, indicate the nature of the operations proceeded with on this most valuable piece of ground. Having been busily engaged with duties on other parts of the district, I have had no opportunity of visiting the Tea-tree Creek, Morrison's or Dolly's Creek, but I should judge them favorable from the large number of applications for survey. The Perseverance Company are still per severing with their experiments; the result of a crushing of about 8 tons of quartz at 55s. per ton, was 3i dwt. per ton. They have issued fresh tenders for sinking their under lie shaft (main shaft) 30 feet and driving 60 feet. The hill known as Hooley's Hill, Dolly's Creek, has been applied for by a Ballaarat sluicing company, who intend erecting large machinery there. Altogether the present prospects of this division are very favorable ; but it is to be regretted that so few men are employed on the different company's grounds in proportion to the quantity of ground held by them. Complaints have been made regarding the extent of ground shut to individual enterprise, while those holding it are either incapable or have no intention to proceed to active opera tions. How parties ought to be dealt with under such circumstances may be a subject for the consideration of the Board. Such practices have been most injurious to the companies themselves ; confining practical operations to one portion of the ground, any fault or mistake ruins the whole enterprise at once ; whereas, if operations were simulta neously proceeded with in different parts, the fortunes of the one would compensate the failure in another, and allow opportunities to proceed without any dead-lock. The reverse of this has and is still seriously retarding the progress of gold mining on this field. The Union Company still cease their oper ations. The Birmingham Reef Prospect Claim Company, of whose ground I sent you some sections illustrating the hazard in quartz mining from shifts and slides in the strata, have uot yet sound their lost vein, they now purpose driving to the east but I fear with no good results in that quarter. The New Years Prospect Claim, as also No. 1 South, are progressing most satisfac torily and obtaining very rich quartz ; I believe No. 1 South Company will crush next week; the result of the last crushing of the Prospect Claim was 12J oz. per ton, and in my opinion No. 1 South will far surpass them. The Kilkenny Reef Prospect Claim Com pany are proceeding well, they have obtained no other crushing since I last wrote. The Old German Reef Company, now known as the Wellington Company, still con tinue active operations ; shares have been sold in the prospect claim for \u00a390 per share ; there has been no crushing from this reef, owing to delays in repairs to tbe crushing mill available for their use ; there are many tons of quartz waiting to be operated on for the same reason. Blackwood Division. (Thomas Hay, Mining Surveyor.) I have the honor to report that operations in mining generally have gone on in this division with a slight tendency to improve ment, in as much as the late rains have given a sensible move to alluvial diggings in par ticular, and there have been some important discoveries made in quartz reefs, upon which I shall be able in my next report to speak more in detail. The Malakhoff Company have continued their usual steady progress ; their operations, by the suspension of the Gibraltar Company's works, have been hindered, as they are com pelled to draw the water off both claims. They have obtained an order from the Warden's Court for \u00a34 10s. per week during the above suspension.

Barry's Reef. \u2014 The operations on this reef have been partially good, but some not very successful, although the prospects at present are of a more cheering aspect. At Bowman's Forest the claims on German Lead that orginally were dry have become flooded, which is causing the miners to sink fresh shafts, and slabbing them as they go down. At present ten claims only are being worked, the others having been abandoned for the rush to the new gold-field just discovered near Wahgunyah. On the Perseverance Lead thirteen claims (of four men each) are held ; they are nearly all doing well. Trewhella's Reef. \u2014 There are three claims on this reef in full work, viz: \u2014 the Pioneer Company ; Trewhella Brothers ; and Sher wood, Taylor and Company, which are all doing well, and are going on with strong anticipations of a prosperous future.

I shall have something to say in my next report regarding these. Several parties are out working at quartz leads; one lead on the right water shed of the Three-mile seems, from the specimens, likely to pay, its thickness is about 2 feet, the gold observable to the eye is very fine. The nearest crushing machine is at Myrtle ford, 18 miles from here, and the quartz has to be sent that distance to be thoroughly tested. BEECHWORTH MINING DISTRICT. Spring Creek, Three-mile, and Woolsiied Divisions. (Henry Grimes, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Nothing of importance has taken place since my last report, with the exception of the discovery of the several leads near Wahgun yah. This is drawing the loose part of the population, and those who are not doing well from the other districts. The plan which I have the honor of en closing is of a survey of part of the Three mile Creek.

The sur face (loose soil) to the depth of one foot has been sluiced, and paid well ; and an attempt was made to sluice the clay also, but was found to be impracticable, the present party therefore erected this mill, and find it pays them handsomely. On the southern bank of the Yackandandah Creek, just above the bridge across the creek, near the Bridge Inn, a very good patch of sluicing ground has been discovered, yielding in places 12 grains to the dish. Numerous races have been cut through and past this ground, three or four years ago, to work ground further down the creek, showing that as soon as payable ground in the bed and on the immediate banks gets scarcer, a large ex tent of ground will be prospected and found payable which was passed by as unlikely looking in former times. The workings on Comasino and Henderson's Reefs are progressing very satisfactorily ; claimholders seem determined to give the reefs a thorough trial, and from the results of two trial crushings which have taken place, with every appearance of success.

One party in particular in the Yackandandah division, the proprietors of one of the exten sive tail races already alluded to in my former reports, had their claim completely filled up with tailings. This party had just finished re-opening their claim (which had been filled up in the earlier part of the season through a heavy flood) at an expense of over \u00a3300, and re-commenced operations when the workings were all filled up again to the level of the creek. This yield will compare favorably with the yield of many quartz districts, and gives every inducement to parties to continue sinking. A lease of the prospecting claim on Co masino Reef has been applied for by the discoverer, but I have not yet made the necessary plans. My time having been fully occupied in preparing plans, &c, for the dams proposed to be erected in the Yackandandah division, I am uuable to forward any plan with this report.

The Main Indigo, Devonshire, Durham, Caledonia, and Kincardineshire Leads, remain al most exactly as at the date of my last report. On the Chiltern Lead several of the engine claims have been idle lately in consequence of tho rush to Wahgunyah. By this mail I forward a sample of black sand obtained iu the Black Dog Forest, about three miles to the south of Chiltern. I shall esteem it a great favor if you will let me know the per centage of tin ore con tained in it, as upon this will depend, in great measure, whether the ground will be worked or not.* Machinery : \u2014 Quartz reefing for the last month has been going on very slowly, though I hope by next report that some change will take place, as numbers are out prospecting. The new gold field discovered in the vi cinity of Wahgunyah, to which I made re ference at the conclusion of my September report, has occasioned such a rush of miners to that locality that the established leads in this district have been more or less deserted during the latter end of the month, and work, as a matter of consequence, has been almost at a standstill. Three leads have already been opened up at Wahgunyah, and have been named respectively the Wahgun yah, Lanarkshire, and Robert Burns. The depth of sinking in the prospecting claim on the first is 137 feet; on the second, 130 feet; and on the third, 92 feet. From each of them very good prospects have been washed, so much as 16 dwt. to the dish having been obtained from the Wahgunyah, though, per haps, it will not average more than 3 oz. to the load after washing. On this lead there is room for only a few claims above the pros pectors, and immediately below the land is purchased ground. Arrangements have how ever been made by the miners with the owners of the freehold land, and claims taken up ; in one instance the owner taking a ninth share for occupation of the ground, and in another, \u00a35 per share on first occu pation, and \u00a35 extra on striking gold. On the Lanarkshire also the extent of un alienated ground is extremely limited. On the Robert Burns the prospectors and the few claims above and below them are on Crown land, but the flat is so wide on the dip that it is impossible at present to say whether this lead will escape private pro perty or not. A large number of miners are settled on the ground, and almost every gully for some miles around is being prospected. * The sample has been assayed, and Is said to contain 72 per cent, of tin.

There is nothing to report this month respecting alluvial mining on the Buckland River, and but little respecting the quartz mines there. The company working the Nelson Reef have not yet completed their new machinery, but will do so in the course of two or three weeks. They state that the quartz continues to look better as they sink, especially in the south-east end of the claim. The reef on Maguire's Flat has not yet been struck in the tunnel, which, however, has been driven in far enough to have the effect of draining the old shaft, which the prospect ors are now continuing to sink. The new reef near Clear Creek is still being prospected, and there are indications of its turning out well. The reef on Murray's Creek has been abandoned. and the Duke of Northumberland, are the most promising ; the others being at present only small veins, and not very rich, it is doubtful whether they will pay for working. Several additional claims have been taken up on the other reefs, but no work of any im portance has been done yet, and until more machinery is in operation nothing can be reported respecting them. Themachinery belonging to Messrs. Mackay, on the Ovens River, and Gitchell and Com pany, on Richardson's Reef, is nearly com pleted, and will probably be in operation in the course of a fortnight. A considerable quantity of quartz is being carted to the former machine from the Lisbon Reef, and roads are in course of formation from Falk ner's and the Woolshed Reefs. During September but little quartz has been crushed except from the Oriental Reef, which has been able to employ all the ma chinery yet at work. Some small parcels, however, have been crushed from the Elgin and Gunder's Reefs, which continue to yield as before ; also two parcels of twenty tons each, one from the Alliance, situate near the Elgin, and which has yielded 20 oz. per ton, and the other from McNully's, which yielded 1J oz. per ton. I am informed that the claims on the Oriental, with the exception of No. 3 South, (from which no quartz has been crushed this month,) have yielded a general average of 2 oz. per ton. In No. 3 South, the reef from which the quartz crushed yielded only 14 dwt., has run out, and the main reef has since been struck a few feet to the eastward, the stone from which looks much better ; at present, however, this claim is registered for a suspension of working, on account of excessive drainage from the surface. I have to report, that in Rossiter and Company's claim (No. 1 North) the reef has run out en tirely in the shaft sunk by that company to a depth of 80 feet. The stone from the Victoria Reef is about being crushed at Rossiter and Company's mill ; it is expected to turn out about 3 oz. per ton. Alluvial mining in the Ovens River portion of the division is likely to increase consider ably this summer, in consequence of the recent discovery of payable ground on the upper part of Morse's Creek. The ground consists exclusively of creek claims, and the sinking averages at present about 12 feet, and this about 4 feet of black loam and clay and 6 feet of heavy waterworn sandstone drift, similar to that in other parts of the district. Underlying this is the washing stuff, of finer gravel, slightly intermixed with yellow clay. The bed-rock is of soft sand stone. The gold is coarser than is usual in this district, and the yield from a prospect I saw washed would be about J oz. per load. I have since been informed that a better yield has been obtained. The prospect alluded to was a load of wash-dirt washed while I was on the ground. The sinking is extremely wet, but the supply of water from the creek, if properly managed, will be quite sufficient for motive power for pumping, and for wash ing. From the nature and general appear ance of this part of the creek I am led to believe that there is a very considerable extent of ground likely to prove payable. No further information has yet been re ceived respecting the gold field reported to have been discovered at the head of the Ovens River. On the Elgin Reef Messrs. Stephens and Company are still sinking for the second reef, and they have gold in the vein of pipe clay they are following. 1 have nothing additional to report this month respecting the other reefs in this district ; in many instances work is brought to a standstill for want of opportunity to crush the quartz, and for want of capital on the part of the miners to raise any great quantity until they can do so. As soon as the new machinery now erecting is com pleted, I shall be in a position to report more fully the prospects of the other reefs enumerated. During the month eight new quartz veins have been discovered in the Ovens district, and named as follows: \u2014 the Rose, Thistle, and Shamrock, and the Hit or Miss, situated about six miles below the Rose of Australia ; the North Briton and Wombat Reefs, situate near the Hibernia ; the Nottingham and Homeward Bound Reefs, situate near the Woolshed; the Shelback, situated close to the West Briton ; and the Duke of Northum berland, situated about half a mile north west of the Oriental.

Sutton's claim, to the south of this company has yielded some very good stone lately ; bo is taking all before him where it is found re munerative, and having his own engine crushing is only a secondary consideration. Le Capelain and Company, to the south of this claim, are crushing pretty fair stone from the north end of their claim ; they have 24 stamps which are kept more or less con stantly at work, regulated of course by tho supply of quartz. SANDHURST MINING DISTRICT. No. 1, Kanoaroo Flat Division. (Edward T. Harper, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Tin Pot, Specimen Hill, Company. \u2014 This line is almost abandoned in appearance; the company have long since discontinued opera tions, and it is expected will soon cease to exist, everything is in the hands of the trustees, expecting shortly to be brought to the hammer ; it is to be hoped it will fall into the hands of more enterprising and business like men, who will give the ground a fair trial to some depth, say a little below the surface, and not content themselves with what is just at their hands and got for the mere carting away, heedless of its quality ; truly a great proportion of the mass of stone gave wages to individual labor, and one spot in particular yielded some very rich patches (on the surface) ; there have been one or two pretty deep shafts sunk within the company's ground, following on under by a spur, but no levels have been carried thence, and as the water-level here will be about 300 feet deep there is, I should think, plenty of scope for testing the value of the hill, and at a trifling cost. There are several prospecting claims around this locality at work, some on new leads, others on old abandoned lines. The machinery is aa follows : \u2014 Since my last report there has been an There has been a new reef opened this mouth situated at the head of Dead Dog Gully, and at the foot of Diamond Hill to the east, about the line of tbe Victoria to the north, and the British and Foreign to the south. The ieef was struck near the surface in the prospecting claim ; a shaft was sunk 15 feet deep, which cut through the cap of a perfect and well-formed reef with its eastern and western limbs, and dipping to the south; there has been several crushings, the last one yielding over 5 oz. to the ton ; there is dis covered on the back of the west limb a body of stone 1 0 feet thick, averaging about 1 7 dwt. per ton ; the line now is in active work to the north and south. over abundance of rain, resulting in floods which have proved very destructive to the alluvial miners, breaking down dams, and flooding the claims ofthe puddlers, and so preventing them from prosecuting their re munerative employment until such damages shall have been remedied, their several claims drained, and the storm-water stored in new dams expressly made for that purpose at a considerable expense. This evil 13 very much felt by the puddlers on Bendigo Flat in particular, caused principally by the bursting __\u2022 _i_ _ 1 i__ __> _i_ _ _._ . . . of the banks of the storm-water channel when full in places where it is carried across a dam or deep paddock ; however, it has given ns a full supply of water, and this branch has again assumed its usual briskness. Glasgow Reef. \u2014 The water shaft of the Drainage Company has struck the reef to the east at a depth of 145 feet, and many of the claims have resumed work ; one or two are getting tolerably good stone, which lies in Quartz mining, Bird's Reef, Kangaroo Gully. \u2014 This line has again resumed its usual activity ; the New Bird's Reef Gold Mining Europeans.

Wilson's Reef, Sparrow Hawk. \u2014 This line will shortly be actively at work ; they have a drainage company of 5 claims, worked by horse-whims, their shaft is 190 feet deep, 200 feet is the depth required at which depth the stone will be cut in a western drive ; this will enable all the claims to test the stone at present struck, to a considerable depth as well as prospect for other reefs. The third claim from the whim shaft are upon a good body of stone yielding 2 oz. per ton. The All Nations claim have the same stone but are not sufficiently deep forthesame lead of gold; much gold has been obtained from this line, but the work was badly carried on, in con sequence of which all the old working fell in, and the ground changed hands, the present owners being obliged to make a new start. I have great faith in the prospects of this reef. Stafford Reef. \u2014 This line is looking up, several of the claims are crushing very fine stone. The German's claim or Hince and Com pany are extracting very rich stone from a very large reef below water level, and should it be found continuous, we may shortly expect to see a pumping engine on the line. The Advertiser claim to the north are upon a very nice-looking body of stone, which crops out at the surface, and underlies to the west ; at 70 feet the stone was cut 1 foot thick, yielding about 2 oz. per ton. They intend commencing also on their deep shaft (180 feet), which is down to the water-level, to search for tbe same body as that which Hince and Company are working. Best and Company, to the north, have lately struck stone in the same body they have all along been working, which is un doubtedly the best yet discovered on Bendigo. The gold lies in great lumps in crevices within the stone, which is milk white ; it is not generally diffused throughout, but appears a continuous vein, which must be followed with care; the same lead was found in Hince's claim, and will no doubt be got in that of the Advertiser. The line is being traced to the north, and several shafts are going down for the same lead of quartz. Specimen Hill Reef, Long Gully. \u2014 The various claims on this line are more or less busy at work raising stone for crushing, which stone is exposed on the surface in great masses ; it is comparatively poor with occasionally a few rich spots or patches ; it is generally all taken before them and crushed as raised, and pays tolerably well. The Mary Ann, prospecting claim, at a depth of 100 feet struck a spur of quartz 6 inches thick, and more or less gold visible throughout; they are following it down on the underlie fully expecting it will lead them to some good body or reef after it shall have left the sandstone through which it is at present being traced ; it is supposed to be the continuation of a spur which cropped out at surface in the next claim, to the south, dipping rapidly northward, and which yielded as much as 7 oz. per ton. Many more claims to the north and south are sinking for the same lead. Carshalton Reef. \u2014 This line is improving, at least a dozen claims are in active work ; the lead is shallow, and about 17 dwt. appears to be about the average yield. Whip Reef. \u2014 This line has been very little worked lately, the company have taken out a lease for their principal claim ; as nothing yet has been decided upon respecting their future operations, the line still remains in abeyance. Axe Creek, Great Western Reef. \u2014 This line is looking busy ; the prospecting claims are getting better than half an ounce per ton from a body of stone 8 feet thick, gold equally distributed, and being quarried out from the surface ; some to the north and south are also getting gold ; the water-level is found in the gully to be only 40 feet deep, and there is some talk of arrangements being made for pumping and crushing machinery: I have not the slightest doubt but that some splendid yields will be obtained from this line at a greater depth. Sheep's Head Reef. \u2014 This line is being extended north and south, and many claims are doing well ; the Union Company, who hold a large portion of the reef and a splendid 12 horse-power crushing machine of twelve stamps upon the ground, continue to crush all before them; the reef is very large, and handsomely remunerates them. Wills and Com pany, to the south, are progressing ; they also crush as it comes, and sometimes pays very well. Curnow and Company, to the south, have lately erected a small crushing machine which is now at work; they have a lease of 150 yards, with a large regular body of stone averaging about 7 dwt. per ton ; the Red, White, and Blue Company to the north of the Union Company are getting quartz yielding 5 oz. to the ton. Hooper and Com pany's claim, to tho north, are also realizing handsome dividends. Alexander Reef, Lockwood. \u2014 The prospect ing claim seems the only one in which gold can be found, and there, eventually it fell off very much ; they are now sinking for the western limb, hoping again to strike the lead; there are several prospecting claims about this neighborhood but nothing of consequence has yet been found."], [448, "MINING SUBVEYOES' BEpoETS \u2014 SEPTEMBEE. 258 The 80 horse-power condensing engine at Huntly (40 stamps) is now at work and the company are beginning to bring their power ful pumping apparatus to bear on the flooded claims \u2014 it is the only chance there is of re covering them ; the pumping has not yet reduced the depth of water. The rush lying to the east of Back Creek is still progressing northward and affords good wages to the miner. I am informed also that the main lead has again been discovered, taking a direc tion very different to what it was supposed to do by the most experienced miners ; I have not yet ascertained its course. Eaglehawk Division. (G. W. Hart, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows :\u2014 The yield of gold from the reefs is about the usual average; one claim on the Catherine Reef however, merits particular notice (the claim of Messrs. Keith and Company) from which stone of extraordinary richness has been raised and it is supposed that it will become still more valuable. When the pump ing engine that is now at work on this reef has got the water under so that the workings may be deepened, it is expected that most of the claims will make excellent returns. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Kilmore Division. (F. M. Hill, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Europeans.

The number of puddling mills is rather on the increase than otherwise, as grants for six of them have been issued during the last month. I cannot ascertain that any material alteration in the number of alluvial miners has taken place within the month of September, my returns of population being much the same as for August. One new crushing machine of 6 horse-power has been lately put up on the Wallace Reef and is now at work, but the one at the Elysian Flat has stopped work, which causes a reduction of 4 horse-power in the returns for this month.

The prin cipal feature in quartz raining, during the past month, was the crushing of a trial lot of four tons, from the Wellington Reef (Pros pector's Claim), the yield from which is 33 oz 8 dwt. The mullock from this claim yielded lj oz. to the ton. One ton of quartz from claim No. 1, north of the same reef, and raised from close to the Prospector's north boundary, yielded a trifle over ten oz. (10) to the ton. This was from a very thin leader, but it is anticipated that it will improve in thickness as it goes down. Jack's, are still looking well ; the yield from the last was 2J oz. to the ton ; of the others I have nothing new to report. Hart's water power machinery has now steam attached, ready to be worked at any time necessary. Numerous parties are still out prospecting in this locality, but up to the present I have heard of nothing fresh being discovered. Heathcote Divsion. (John Breen, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Landridge Reef Company have raised some fair stone during the month, but crush ing operations have been suspended, in order to put their plant in thorough repair. Rich specimens have been raised from the Captain's Reef (Nickinson and Company's claim), but I have not ascertained, at present, the result of any crushing from there. Quartz has been crushed from the Albert and Ma genta Reefs, but I am informed that the results were not considered payable. During the present month (October) a number of registrations of quartz claims will expire, and tbe owners, in all probability, give them another trial, which, in some instances, I am inclined to think will be successful. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 On the King Parrot Creek, Fortune and Company's shaft has been sunk to a depth of 100 feet. In completion of the first contract a large quantity of water has been encountered, but large buckets hauled by steam power have been found sufficient for draining at that depth. It is in contemplation to drive in to east, to cut the leader known to exist. As soon as the water is reduced on this reef (Triangle), I expect to be able to report good quartz being raised. At Muddy Creek (Yea), a crushing from the Providence Reef yielded over an ounce (1 oz.) to the ton, from a body of stone 2 feet thick. On the Carriers' Reef water is still the great hindrance, and till efficient ma chinery be erected I do not think much more quartz will be raised. I may here mention, that the stone from this reef has averaged over 10 oz. to the ton. It is in con templation to form an association to prospect the alluvial flats on this creek, the water present on these rendering individual exertion useless. Rough, water-worn gold has been found on the Boundary Creek, a tributary of the Muddy Creek, as well as at the Junction, both of which places lie in the same water shed. Alluvial Mining. \u2014 Notwithstanding the absence of any new auriferous ground being discovered, or any improvements being made on the old system of mining, the results for the month of September prove that there still exists a large quantity of gold in this locality. Three nuggets weighing respec tively 39 oz., 33 oz., and 7 oz. have been obtained from previously worked ground in Argyle Gully ; one tub and cradle miner in Golden Gully has for some time past obtained a weekly average of 16 oz ; a party near Wattle Flat have each had a weekly average of 12 oz. ; whilst the majority of the pud- At the Tea tree the principal reefs, viz., Jonier's, Enniskillen, Dunrobin, and German Europeans.

In the claim (Poster's) adjoining the company's ground very valuable stone has just been struck at a depth of 112 feet. Most of the alluvial workings continue to be conducted in an almost primitive manner. There are at present extensive tracts of already worked auriferous lands which un doubtedly would pay well with an improved system of machinery, lying absolutely aban doned. Long Gully Reef \u2014 In consequence of the satisfactory crushings lately obtained from this reef, tbe company by which it is worked have determined on employing a greater number of men to mine on a more systematic and an enlarged manner. At Balmoral Diggings, Staffordshire Flat, there are about 280 persons employed in allu vial mining, and although the average remu neration is not above ordinary wages some claims are paying remarkably well. Norris's Reef.\u2014 The proprietors of this reef are actively employed in raising large quanti ties of quartz. Owing to the wash-dirt being not more in maximum depth than eleven feet below the surface of the ground, there is nothing of sufficient interest in connection with it to be notified. The Spaniard's Reef. \u2014 This is a lately dis covered reef, the proprietors of which are sanguine in their expectations \u2014 moreover when six tons of trial stone has given 2J oz. to the ton. At Balmoral most of the reefs are nameless; nearly all the claims are payable, and some are very valuable; from the short time they have been worked it is difficult to define them Quartz Mining.\u2014 There is an evident pro gressive change in this branch of mining, capitalists are taking more interest in the locality, and naturally prospecting and quartz workings are becoming more extensive. Many claims have been marked out on ranges hitherto unnoticed, several of the abandoned reefs have been again taken up and vigorously worked. As it is only lately the stimulus for reefing has taken place, the quantity of stone r/iised is comparatively trifling, consequently few crushings have been made, so that the result is yet dubious. with anything like accuracy. The following is a list of the crushings for the month from as many of the reefs as I have been enabled to obtain :\u2014 Heathcote. The general causes of the neglect in quartz mining in Heathcote heretofore were \u2014 the absence of capital, the incapability of the enterprising miner to support himself whilst sinking shafts, and the abandonment of pay able claims consequent on the striking of water, when the proprietors were unable to erect pumping machinery. The Caledonian Reef continues to be ac tively worked ; the new crushing machinery is nearly completed, and has already crushed 122 tons. During the erection of the ma chinery the pumping had to be suspended, hence, from the fact of the water in the shafts, &c, rising from a depth of 235 feet to within 140 feet of the surface, the company are much cramped in their operations. At present they can raise fifty tons weekly, and they have 400 tons ready for crushing. Balmoral. Butler's Reef. \u2014 This long abandoned reef has been taken up by a company, and is about being energetically worked : water being within 128 feet of the surface, the company cannot carry on the workings for some time on as extensive a manner as they could wish.

The population is as follows : \u2014 Now the velocity or speed of the ordinary stampers in use is about 55 blows per minute, while Wall's is satisfied his stampers will make from 180 to 200 blows per minute, thus each of the latter nearly doing the work of four of the former, and striking, at the same time, from 700 to 900 Ibs. per blow. The heads and beds are so arranged that they can be replaced in a few minutes. The stampers are circular which receive additional revolving force in coming in contact with the uneven surface of the quartz. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The cost per ton for crushing, including wear and tear, labor, fuel, and other incidental expenses, it is estimated will not exceed 3s. The consumption of steam per stamper will be about \u00a3 of what is required by the most improved now in use, aud the crushing pro ceeds as follows : \u2014 The steam conveyed from the boiler B through the steam pipe MN' and thence through NV N'V to the cylinders CC lifts the pistons PP' and hence the stampers SS' also, when a vacuum is created, and be fore the steam recedes through the exhausting pipe KR it gives an additional impetus to the pistons amounting from 300 to 350 above the weight of the stampers and rods. There is no limit to the velocity or speed, but it has been practically ascertained that when it comes up to 250 blows the machine cannot be fed effectively. Herewith is forwarded a plan of the prin cipal mining portion of my division, showing the relative position, &c, of the different old leads, quartz reefs, and gullies. After having made a circuit of the mining portion of my division, I find little to add by way of additional information, except a new crushing machine (Wallis's) just erected on the extreme south of my division, near Amherst.

On the contrary, the miners have more confi dence in their permanency than ever. Here with I forward a plan, showing the position, &c, of both leads. As an instance of the richness of some of the claims on the Scan dinavian, 1 may mention that forty-three loads of wash-dirt (principally cement), taken from the West of England claim, yielded 210 oz. of gold; likewise 373 loads, from tbe United Miners' claim, yielded 565J oz. Vertical sections Nos. 1 and 2 will show the character of the lead in those places. The lead gene rally, as far as it has been traced, is of a highly remunerative character; but I am unable to state particulars with regard to that portion of the Old Scandinavian Lead, which is now nearly abandoned, and which is very considerable (see plan). From the United Miners' claim to the junction of both leads shows very lively appearance. Amherst Division. (Charles Cole, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Rocky Flat. \u2014 Th's lead (a frontage one) is fully occupied as far it can be extended in both directions. The Engine claim, referred to in my last report, has since then struck payable gold at a depth of 90 feet. On Rocky Flat west two new whims have been erected. Next month I shall furnish further sections, illustrative of those leads. Rocky Point. \u2014 This lead (also a frontage one), the position of which will be shown next month, has been rushed again, in con sequence of the shareholders in Nos. 3 and 4 having had very good dividends lately, amounting to six pounds sterling per man per week. They have hitherto worked their ground with the assistance of a whim, but in future must supply steam power, in consequence of the great influx of water.

Amphitheatre and Mountain Hut Diggings, with the exception of a slight decrease in the population at the last rush to the former place, present no noticeable change. The whole of the miners remaining (numbering 2000) upon these workings appear to be earning good wages. Four-mile Flat still retains its population ; and although several of the first claims sunk have washed up, those parties are either prospecting further down the flat, with the hope of again striking the lost lead, otherwise remuneratively employed in the adjacent shallow workings. Price of crushing (per ton): quartz, 20s. to 25s.; cement, 20s. On the Avoca proper, mining, both in allu- vial and quartz, during the last month, has been prosecuted with renewed energy. At the Deep Lead a large party of (150) Chinese, working eight whims, besides several hand machines, have partially succeeded iu overcoming the vast quantity of water with which they have had to contend in some of their claims ; the result being that rich patches of auriferous drift reward their per- severence. These patches are found princi- pally in blocks of ground, left most probably for support, instead of timbering, by previous occupants; the yield, per load, with several feet thickness of dirt, being an ounce on the average. Quartz mining also has assumed a most lively appearance. On the Township Reef a party named Hogg have for some time past been prospecting the hill to tho west of the original workings, the ultimatum being the discovery of a payable lode, three feet thick, yielding near the surface down on the average an ounce to the ton. Thirty claims at present are working upon this supposed reef, most of which have seen gold near the surface, but I cannot vouch for it all being of a payable quality. On my visiting these workings I observed several small quartz veins, or leaders, runningbotb perpendicularly and transversely, and my own impression is that a considerable depth will have to be attained before these converge into and form one main reef. At Lamplough I cannot note any material change in mining sincJ my last. Several of the small rushes in the immediate vicinity appear to give remunerative employment to a large number of miners whilst water for wash ing purposes is easily obtained ; but in the absence of any natural or artificial means for Considerable dissatisfaction prevails amongst the miners in this locality, in consequence of none of the many prospecting parties re ceiving Government aid having yet reported any payable new gold field, especially, as the configuration of this district, extending over a vast area of virgin ground, presents every indication of it being highly auriferous. I beg also to inform your Honorable Board, that with a view of compiling statistics relative to the annual quantity of rain-fall in this dry part of the district, 1 have erected a rain-gauge at Avoca, commencing my. obser vations (daily) on the first of the last quarter, at 1 a.m., from which date to 1 p.m. this day, the aggregate quantity of rain has been 2.83 inches : and 12 hours prior to the former date a depth of 1.45 inches, consequently for four teen days ending 1 p.m. 13th instant, the aggregate depth of rain has been 4.28 inches, a quantity, I presume, nearly equal to one fourth of the fall during the twelvemonth.

On the Bolivia Reef, at a depth of 145 sect, 10 feet below the water-level, the quartz is yielding 7 oz. per ton. A quantity of stone from the Great Western returns 15 dwt. per ton. The Cum berland Reef, 1 oz per ton, aud Prior's Sand stone Reef, 19 tons yielded 1J oz. per ton. The public companies generally arc improv ing ; the Old Specimen Gully obtained 100 oz. last week, and I confidently believe, during the coming summer, there will be a great augmentation to our present yield of matrix gold. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 In accordance with instructions, requiring each month an original plan, or tracing, show ing any survey upon which I may have been employed, 1 have the honor to forward plans of Forest Creek, upon which I have been employed several weeks, for the purpose of plotting its present course, to show any necessary improvements in that course, and the best means of preserving it from suture obstructions The accompanying plans show a portion of the survey. The old course, as per lithographic plans, is colored yellow ; the present course colored blue ; improve ments suggested colored lake ; separate sludge, dotted line red. The tributary sludge channels are also shown ; the number of puddling machines and quartz crushing machines running sludge into the tributary channels, &c. 1 have also run the levels fol lowing the present course of the creek 10J miles, and insert figures showing the water level of creek above datum, low water mark, Hobson's Bay. The levels show a very good fall for running off sludge, being along Forest Creek, as per plan, 162'70 feet in 4j miles, and in the total length from Bonnet Flat, Forest Creek, to Taylor's Home Station, Strathloddon, distance 10J miles, 254'79 feet. During the month mining operations have been seriously impeded by repeated floods which have been unusually sudden and destructive, flooding claims, washing away roads, bridges, dams, machines, &c, and com mitting depredation and damage to gardens and private property; as however, iu some way to compensate, we have a cleared creek, the great accumulation of sludge and debris being washed away, from 4 to 6 feet deep, and from 30 to 80 feet wide, leaving generally a splendid course open for any subsequent floods, provided a separate sludge channel could be excavated. The most remarkable feature of the month has been the activity of the Chinese. A flood always gives great impetus to their opera tions, from its acting naturally as a sluice, washing off the lighter particles. Gold is sound on the creek's course, and swatms of Chinese are, from morning to night, midway in water, hemming up debris from the water bed, and washing it in cradles as fresh deposits are made by each flood. Constant employment is given to this indefatigable race of miners. The present course is materially different from its original run, caused principally by mining operations having been carried on in the creek, and its course filled far above its original banks by debris and sludge from puddling machines. The flood-waters had to make a new course ; our present creek is the result, and my object is-to protect that course, and thereby prevent further damage resulting from a blockaded course. In quartz mining I have to report an improvement, as, in addition to payable results obtained from claims so frequently reported, new claims and reefs have been opened, with very promising results. The only practical and permanent means is to cut a separate main channel for the sludge, into which all puddlers should run their private drains, and to leave the present creek undisturbed (except in the few necessary improvements suggested), as a storm-water channel only, for which purpose it is well adapted, being broad and flat. . The Old Quartz Hill Company realised, from fourteen days' work, 114 oz. 4 dwt. On a northern portion of Commercial Reef, within the township, a new claim yielded from 3 tons 15 oz., and 8 tons 16 oz. 9 dwt.

The cutting is only 114 feet, or little more than half sufficient, its bottom being only 12 feet, while the natural course is over 33 feet; the consequence is that the creek has broken through, and is running in its original course. a steadiness and activity that speak well for the future ; and, although very few new claims have been taken up during the past month, those occupied are being worked very vigorously. Alluvial Mining. \u2014 Puddling has in many instances been retarded in consequence of the heavy rains, but generally the injured parties have gone to work to repair the damages sustained with a will that does them credit. N.B. \u2014 Whilst engaged on this survey, I have tried to account for the tortuous course of our creeks, the natural tendency of running waters being in curves of greater or less radii, generally running under the highest ranges, crossing and re-crossing low flats to do so. Whether the high grouud has the power of attraction I cannot determine, but it is an important question in cutting new channels ; and I think, had the creek at new cut, Castlemaine, been allowed to run to rocks, and diverted therefrom, it would answer better. Tunnelling is still very actively carried on, and the miners as a rule doing well. Ru mours are afloat that a run of hills has been opened about a mile to the east of Middle ton's Creek, of the same character as the Table Hills of Kangaroo; however, I am not in a position to give you any definite infor mation on the subject, but will ascertain the truth or otherwise of the statement and re port thereon in my next. Sluicing operations have been almost en tirely suspended during the latter part of last month, also in consequence of the floods, but the sluicers intend waiting patiently for their cessation, as a very few of the claims have been registered. This branch of mining in this district is subject to great fluctuation, as the ground occupied generally comprises the beds of rivers and creeks, and are of course subject to floodings at every rainfall. Frter's Creek Division. (R. L. M. Kitto, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Quartz Mining. \u2014 I have to report the dis covery of a new reef at the head of Sailor's Gully. The discoverers have realised 2 oz. to the ton from the first crushing, and al though they have at present only a series of horizontal leaders, I see excellent indications of a main lode being in the vicinity. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The discovery of a gold-bearing reef is always a cheering fact ; it is, however, par ticularly so in this instance, as it is in a hitherto supposed barren part of the district. Several claims have been taken up, but neither them nor the prospectors have as yet struck payable stone. Digging's Reef. \u2014 A rather extensive rush has taken place on this reef, and five (5) of the claims have struck gold, but in what quantities I am unable to ascertain. Emu Reef. \u2014 No. 1 claim (Rowe's) on this reef is turning out very well just now, as also is No. 2. The other part of the reef, held by the Emu Company, has been rushed ; but it being in the hands of the Court of Mines, the miners were obliged to retire. Ferron's Reef. \u2014 The claimholders on this reef are doing remarkably well; and most of the ground, at one time either registered or entirely abandoned, has been again taken up. I have the honor to report, that during the month of September no visible change of importance has taken place in this district. The various works are being carried on with Companies. \u2014 This district has been parti cularly unfortunate in its mining companies, Europeans.

The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Eldorado Company. \u2014 The splendid plant on this mine is still standing idle, with no appear ance of immediate commencement of opera tions. It appears there is a dispute between the manager and the contractor, as to the style of ripples to be used. However, the company are vigorously preparing the mine for earnest working. To give you an idea of the immense and regular bodies of quartz this company have in their claim, I send herewith a vertical sec tion of the reef as seen by me at various depths. Windlass Hill Company. \u2014 This company has been declared insolvent, and everything is to be sold off. If such is to be the fate of our alluvial mining companies, the sooner they meet it the better for all concerned, as there are several acres of payable alluvial soil locked up, pending the settlement of their affairs. No visible change has taken place in tho European portion of our mining population during the month of September. Alliance Company. \u2014 The works of this company have been retarded through the falling in of a portion of their mine, the damage has been partially repaired, and they are going on again smoothly, so much so, that a dividend is expected in a week or two. I have experienced some difficulty in arriving at the approximate number, as a large number of claims in Yandoit, taken up the last couple of months, do not yet employ the full number of men they represent; but I believe the above statement to be as nearly correct as I, under the circumstances, can ascertain. Vaughan Company. \u2014 I am happy to have at least one prosperous company to report on. This is the smallest company in the district, but promises to be one of the most prosperous. It is divided into forty shares of \u00a3100 each, which are at about \u00a320 premium. Last month they declared a dividend of \u00a35 10s. per share, and the same amount is expected this month. In the number of steam crushing machines no increase has taken place as yet, but several now ones are spoken of as likely to be erected if the present impetus to quartz mining in Yandoit establishes the perma nency of our reefs. The aspect of mining affairs has vastly improved since general attention has been devoted to quartz reefs, and although no new discoveries worthy of remark have taken place during the month, still the greatest activity is manifest. Tbe principal lines of reef in Yandoit are taken up, and being pro spected for miles, in most instances by strong well organised parties, having at hand suf ficient capital to give the ground a thorough trial, and if necessary to erect sufficient machinery. Most of the prospecting shafts started within these last months, have started with a fixed determination of sinking at least 100 feet before driving, and I therefore trust in a month or two to be able to report favorable of the Yandoit reefs, Tbe yields of the claims already proved payable fully equals any other gold field, and it is only reasonable to expect that a good system of working, backed by capital and perseverance, will here as elsewhere, meet with its reward. They occupy a lease of a portion of Kan garoo Hill, near the Loddon, through which runs a promising quartz reef. Hepburn Division. (Ambrose Johnson, Mining Surveyor.)

Steele and Company of the Prospecting Claim, and Messrs. Bear and Company of the adjoining claim north, are still getting first class stone. From the last named claim, the last crushing of 7J tons produced 90 oz. of gold. The ad joining claims have all attained the water level, and have therefore temporarily sus pended operations. The Great Reef Com pany's engine is, however, about being re moved to the reef, to work a large extent of ground belonging to the company, both on Pioneer Reef and the Great Reef adjoining, and operations will then be greatly facilitated. An engine-shaft has already been started on claim No. 4 South, lately purchased for \u00a3200 by the company, the shaft to be 10 x 4 feet, and sunk to a depth of 120 feet, at \u00a34 per foot. New Nuggety and Welcome Reefs, in Con nell's Gully, are both being vigorously worked, averaging three-quarters to one ounce per ton. Wombat Reef is, as usual, yielding a hand some profit to the Cornish party, owing more to their superior method of working than to the quality of the stone. On the whole the average yield of the claims at work may be estimated at 1 oz. to 1| oz. per ton, but large extents of ground where 8 to 10 dwt. per ton has been obtained are at present wholly deserted. Messrs. Rowe and Company, of the Mel ville's Reef, head of Blind Creek, have, during the wet season, been puddling the surface on their claim, but have now made arrangements with Messrs. Needham and Company, of Doctor's Gully, for the removal of their engine to the ground, and I expect that several reefs in the vicinity will be worked the ensuing summer. On Hamburg Reef, Messrs. Jocham and Company of the Prospecting Claim, and Messrs. Ritter and Company of the adjoining claim south, are both raising quartz expected to average 5 to 7 oz. per ton. The rest of the claims are all busy sinking. Puddling and Sluicing. \u2014 During the past month a considerable fall of rain has caused an ample supply of water for all sluices, and there is every prospect of having a sufficient supply far into the summer months. The monotony of puddling and sluicing has not, during the past month been enlivened by any new discoveries, the population being all fully engaged on claims in the most instances occupied by the respective parties for years, and I believe on the whole making very satisfactory returns. From tbe Glamorganshire Reef, a trial crushing at the Franklinford Mill produced 14J dwt. per ton, and good prospects have been obtained on three or sour claims. The reef is a southern continuation of the Ham burg, and great faith in ultimate success is therefore entertained. From Hoggett's Reef, 11 tons from the prospecting claim produced about 55 oz., and the re6t of the ground, for a long time deserted, has been taken up in consequence. The lease on Wombat Flat having been declared forfeited the ground has nearly all been taken up for puddling, and it is generally believed that the ground will prove very remunerative. From Trogish Reef 2J oz. per ton has been obtained, and I am informed that No. 2 North on Homeward Bound Reef is raising stone ex pected to yield 3 to 4 oz. per ton. Malcolm's Reef and New German Reef are still producing good stone; and almost every hill about Yandoit, for a considerable distance, is enli vened with the presence of prospecting parties in search of new reefs. The flat opposite Henderson's store at Boots has also lately been taken up, and the parties are sluicing off the headings by means of Mr. Cortial's race from Sailor's Creek, intending to puddle the wash-dirt. A very good lead was discovered there about eighteen months ago, and by facing up the ground I have no doubt that good blocks will be found left. Mr. Morrison's new crushing machine, on the Jim Crow Creek, has undergone some slight alterations, and is now ready for work ; and a new powerful engine, destined for the Old German Reef, is on the road from Bal laarat. The upper part of Boots Gully, as well as \" Keep it dark,\" are also being faced out, and some splendid small nuggets are now and again being turned up. In the southern part of my division (Jim Crow Proper) the usual activity in quartz mining is prevailing, but nothing of more than ordinary interest or importance has occurred since the date of my last report. The attention bestowed upon Yandoit is, however, beginning gradually to extend in this direction ; and I trust that the improved system of prospecting now introduced will not be without a direct influence on the general progress of quartz mining. Connell's Gully and vicinity has, during the month, been amply supplied with water, and presents in consequence every appearance of prosperity. On Week's Flat, Jim Crow Creek, and the point immediately below Excelsior Hotel, in ground that on several occasions has been prospected and deserted, parties have for the last month, and are now averaging \u00a312 to \u00a320 C"], [458, "268 MINING SUBVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 SEPTEJIBEB per man per week, forming a striking instance of the manner this division iu former days has been prospected. their operations by the heavy influx of water from the basalt rock, and have therefore now amalgamated for the purpose of giving the ground a thorough trial, and if necessary, erecting efficient machinery. In New Nuggety Gully a comparatively large number of persons are engaged, but I have not heard of any remarkably heavy finds during the month. Tunnelling is favorably progressing. Several extended claims in old deserted ground have been taken up, aud in many instances the enormous heaps of headings left at the mouths of abandoned tunnels, are now paying first rate wages for puddling and sluicing. On the elevatod plains a party of Italians have lately broken into the gutter in a paddock belonging to Mr. Megget, with whom they have made arrangements, and 1 am informed that the show is unusually promising. This lead is supposed to be a more easterly gutter than the one previously worked north of the paddock, and several new tunnels are being started in search of it. On my geological plan of the elevated plains, I had predicted the existence of a gutter in that locality, and although nothing definite is known as yet, still I am pretty confident that my supposition will be verified. In a tunnel, having worked upwards of 15 months in pay able ground, twelfth shares have lately shifted hands at \u00a3170, and on facts like this I sound my opinion \u2014 that tunnelling is one of our most profitable branches of mining: A party of miners is in course of formation for the working of the lower part of King William's Gully, where the lead, owing to the great amount of drift water, was lost, but operations have not yet been commenced. Taradale Division. (Thomas Turner, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 Alluvial sinking. \u2014 In this branch of mining I have no important news to report. In the southern part of the division the primitive tub and cradle have almost entirely disappeared, giving way to puddling machines, or where a sufficient supply of water can be commanded, to sluicing. In Boots and surrounding gullies a few parties are still earning a precarious living in the old ground but their number is fast diminishing. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 In Yandoit, a number of parties have set in in the upper part of the Forty-foot Lead, where a good livelihood may still be depended on, but most of these are connected with parties prospecting for reefs, and intend only to remain till a chance in quartz is afforded. In Mr. Morrison's paddock a great part of tbe old workings is also taken up, and several parties having rented claims in the eastern portion of the paddock on a distinct newly discovered shallow lead, are obtaining as much as 1 to 3 oz. per load, by 2 to 3 feet of wash-dirt. In the Hit or Miss Company, in the next paddock north, shares have lately shifted hands at \u00a390, but I do not know whether this high figure is owing to the Forty Foot Lead having been again discovered, or to the shallow lead mentioned in my last report. K.B.\u2014 There has been a small addition to our mining population by new comers from other fields ; and a few of our old miners have changed their operations from quartz mining to alluvial. Campaspe River Diggings. \u2014 The chief place of attraction to the miners during the month of September has been a spot on the Carapaspe Kiver, about three miles north of Mr. Mitchell's Several parties were prospecting the ground between Smith's store and the Jim Crow Creek, where the last named lead is expected to cross, but have been greatly retarded in Europeans .

Gold was discovered there in August as I mentioned in my last report. The place is situate 15 miles from Kyneton in a direct line, and 12 miles north-east from Taradale. As many as 200 miners had assembled there at one time, but at present there are not above 100 remaining, by reason of the hard nature of the sinking (the stratum being trap-rock) which discouraged many from risking the chances of success under a necessarily ex pensive process. but more expensive method of horse or steam power puddling machines. Several parties are out prospecting this new field of the Campaspe, trying the most likely looking places far and near on both sides of the river. The country to the eastward is of silurean schist formation, but that to the westward is trappean. It appears a circumstance worthy of note, that throughout the Taradale district the greatest alluvial deposits of gold have been found on the verges of (and in many cases underlying) the trappean deposits \u2014 supporting a supposition that rich gold fields might be covered up by those lava beds. On the 8th September Geo. B. Antagnini obtained a privilege of 300 feet square on the left bank of the river, as a reward for his en terprise in prospecting the district. He and his party having washed out an ounce of the precious metal from a ton of earth taken from some drift which they had found at the foot of a high and steep hill of trap-rock formation, and having traced the auriferous drift lying under the trap-rock, were induced to drive a tunnel into the hill side; but unfortunately they have not found the diluvial deposit equally rich in gold, which circumstance has greatly checked the ardor of many. However, euterprising spirits are not wanting there, for two other tunnels are being excavated a few yards further north, and two more on the western side of the same bill ; also ten shafts are being sunk from the summit, one of which is now forty-five feet in depth, yet none but the prospecting party have hit upon any auri ferous deposit. Another new spot has been opened up nearer Taradale, about 2 \\ miles from the township in an easterly direction. The dis coverers, who were a party employed by the local prospecting association, have been awarded an extended claim of 250 feet square. The place however has not attracted much notice as yet, there being not more than thirty miners at the spot. Some claims are said to yield 4 dwt. of gold from the tub of earth. The sinking is shallow, not exceeding fifteen feet. With respect to the old ground where mining has been some time pursued, Victoria Gu'ly and the adjoining ones still employ about fifty miners, but nothing remarkable has transpired of late. Many persons are waiting to see the results of a few shafts' bottoming, in order to lessen the dubious prospects of success, before they expend the necessary labor. In diggers' par lance they are said to be shepherding their claims. The Victoria and Ashtonia Reefs, in five of the claims, give very encouraging prospects to their owners. Crushings of quartz from these two reefs during the month are as fol lows : \u2014 Victoria Reef : oz. dwt. Some 2J miles further down the river a party has applied to the warden for a grant to work an ordinary sluicing claim in some ground that had been tested before, but appa rently without sufficient inducement to en courage perseverance, as the ground had been abandoned.

Other miners are engaged on the western slope of the Talbot Hill, some at the back of the National Hotel, and several in different places within the precincts of the township. Two tunnels are being worked at Yankee Point and one at Scorpion Hill; there are also three horse puddling machines at work in the vicinity of the township. I have a conviction that much of the poor auriferous ground in this division of the gold fields could be advantageously worked on the sluicing principle, if the mining regulations encouraged such work on new ground. The Campaspe River, the Coliban, the Back Creek, and the Kangaroo Creek afford au abundant supply of water throughout all the year. Their banks in many places show great indications of the existence of auriferous deposits, which seem too poor to reward the miners under the ordinary mode of operation with tub and cradle, or even with the superior Of late the Chinese have been very busy in the bed of the creek, where they stand for"], [460, "270 MINING SUBVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 SEPTEMBEE. parties, exploring the country around, under the patronage of the Taradale Prospecting Association. hours together, up to their middles in water, scooping up the gravel from the bottom, which their mates wash in cradles on the bank. Last month there were twenty-four men out exploring, but oue party having struck payable gold, withdrew from the association ; relinquishing the public support, to prolit by their discovery in working the extended area of ground awarded to discoverers of new gold fields by the mining board regulations; as I remarked in a former paragraph of this report. An application has been sent in to the Government by a mining company for a lease of 9 acres of old worked ground, situate on the Back creek, immediately adjoining the township on the south. There is an auri ferous quartz reef cropping out close to the creek known as Castle Rock, which although not very rich in gold, is thought would pay for working under the advantages of efficient machinery. It is chiefly on account of this reef that the application to lease the ground has been made. St. Anorew's Division. Another application has been made for a lease of 10 acres of old worked ground higher up the creek, a mile from the township. This block has been taken up for the purpose of puddling away the joil with the aid of steam power. (James Murphy, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 A party of Italians have taken up three acres of this old worked ground contiguous to the last mentioned piece. They are cutting a wide and deep race, quarter of a mile in length, to carry off the tail water, as they purpose to sluice-wash away the earth to obtain the gold. The Coliban Mining Company have re sumed work with their steam puddling machine, which has so long been idle. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 These workings are situate on private property about two miles south of Taradale. Humboldt Reef. \u2014 There has not been any quartz crushed from these mines during the month ; but I hear that the prospects from two of the claims are very favorable. A patch of auriferous quartz was found about three weeks ago, in Charcoal-burner's Gully, half a mile west of Taradale ; 2 tons of it yielded 2 oz. 7 dwt. of gold. The discovery caused some little excite ment amongst the miners, who as usual eagerly strove for priority in marking off their claims, but unfortunately no auriferous reef has been struck up to the present time ; and this discouragement has induced most of them to leave the spot. Malmsbury Diggings. \u2014The party who took up a lease of 10 acres of ground at a place three miles south of Malmsbury, in July are doing well. Their system of tunnelling under the bank, and puddling the auriferous earth with a horse machine, proves a profitable speculation. Since my last report, there is a very mani fest improvement in the prospects of this division, owing to the recent discoveries near Mount Baw-baw, and to the steadiness with which quartz mining is followed as an occu pation by those engaged in that branch of mining industry. There has, however, been but little quartz crushed, owing to the fact of the miners generally holding over their quartz Prospecting for New Fields. \u2014 Twenty ex perienced miners are rat in five different Europeans.

The reason of this pause in operations is, that a reduction is expected to be made in the price of crushing, and also some imprbvements in the apparatus for amalgamating and saving the gold. this creek, will, I dare say, average about two sluice heads of water or a run of 40 inches sectional area all the year. Pheasant, or Salt Damper Creek, situated about 5 miles S. 80 W. from Mount Baw-baw, is a mere gully, not having more than one sluice head of water, and will, no doubt, be dry or nearly so in summer. The sinking in this creek or gully is frc*i 2 to 3 feet from the surface to the bed-rock, first through about 6 inches of soil or mud and the re mainder through a drift, composed of a little clay, with fragments of gray rubbly sand stones, blue and yellow clay slate, and a large quantity of quartz, and resting upon gray sandstone alternating with slate. The sand is almost entirely quartzose and small frag ments of amethyst are cc imonly found here also. The soil on the hills each side of this creek overlies a reddish yellow plastic clay, and, like the soil all over this country, is of exceeding richness, as is. indicated by the number and size of the tre^ ferns and the luxu riant growth of the scrub and creeping vines, amongst which I observed one that appears to me to be a vine-like variety of the fern. Musk trees and sassafras trees of immense growth are to be found in'all the creeks and gullies, and also the common nettle is to be met with occasionally. The gold that I have seen taken from the Pheasant Creek is of a nuggety character and not at all water-worn, which induces me to suppose that the quartz veins which yielded it must be at no great dis tance, and of great width, judging from the large amount of quartz fragments and drift and from the roll of the country. With reference to the Baw-baw gold field, which I have recently visited, I beg to state that when a convenient track is opened to and also through that locality, I have no doubt that a gold field will be opened up, of such an extent and richness as will give highly remunerative employment to numbers of miners who are now working for a bare living, or rather for a subsistence, and to many others, if they will work for a livelihood. The route to this gold field is through Dandenong, and thence along the Gipps Land road until the Tarwin is passed ; beyond which, about two miles, tbe track to the gold fields will be found. Along this track sup plies, sufficient for the few miners there at present, can, with the greatest difficulty, be brought on pack-horses, owing to the preci pitous and scrubby ranges over which the track lies for about 23 miles, the ranges be coming more steep and precipitous as the gold field is approached, until they, probably, assimilate in height with the great dividing range between the waters of the Yarra and the La Trobe, which must lie east and west at no great distance north of the gold field. Indications of gold are to be found all over tbe country, from the Fern-tree Gullies to the Baw-baw gold field, and probably along the dividing range on its southern side for a great distance to the eastward, and I have no doubt that it would well repay the prospector to try the Tarwin and its tributaries from the Gipps Land road upwards. I observed that wherever the surface is abraded quartz is to be found, associated sometimes with brown and yellow sandstones and sandy shales, and sometimes with slate and rubbly sandstones. The amount of quartz fragments mixed with the soil and clay in some places there is re markable. On the Caledonia gold field, quartz mining is being carried on with considerable spirit aud skill, by Messrs. Holmes, Randle, Ricards, and Company, at the Yow-yow Hill. They have their tunnel driven, now, to a distance of 500 feet, well timbered where necessary, a line of tramway laid along its whole length, and extending about 150 yards from the mouth of the tunnel, towards that part of the Old Caledonia Creek called Salter's rush ; which it is to cross and to terminate at their quartz mill, the old crushing machinery of which has been replaced by three batteries of four revolving stamps each, and will be ready for work within the current month. The headings from the tunnel, are being run down to the creek, for the double purpose of forming an embankment for the tramway and a dam for the reservoir. Hawthorn Creek (the first auriferous creek known to have been discovered on the Baw baw gold field) is situated about eight miles S.W. from Mount Baw-baw; here the sinking is from 2 to 3 feet through a gravelly and sandy drift composed of a little clay with fragments of a hard gray altered sandstone, sometimes with black striations, talcose slate, quartz, and clay slates of different varieties, amongst which is one very fine variety of roofing slate ; small fragments of amethyst are also found in this creek, but the amount of gold is not known. The water supply in The works of the Yow-yow Hill Mining Company are also progressing ; and will, I have no doubt, reach payable quartz within six weeks, as they have not more than about 110 feet to drive before they strike the principal vein. There are other veins in the ground C-i-"], [462, "MINING SUBVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 SEPTEMBER. 272 through which they are driving, and which they intend working as they meet with them. Creek, and there being no rivers or gullies to be crossed, it would afford a convenient route for the transit of stores to the country about Mount Baw-baw, and I believe that 1 could trace it out and open it up at no very great expense. In alluvial mining I am glad to be able to report, that the heaviest finds of gold that have occurred upon this gold field since it was discovered, have been met with during the past month, in the upper part of Happy Valley, known as the Fern- tree Gully. One very fine nugget was found by a man named Cranstown, which weighed 5 lb. 8 oz., Another was found that weighed 40 oz. ; and I am informed and believe, that from some of the claims gold has been taken out by pounds weight, for some time past; but the lucky finders of some of this gold were very silent about it. I have shown also on the sketch tho number of foot-bridges constructed by the Government prospectors ; there are ten of them, just sufficiently wide to allow a horse to pass over. They are built of stout poles, mostly sassafras, of which there is the greatest abundance within a few yards of where each of these bridges is constructed. (Continued from p. 263 ) A reference to the plan of Happy Valley will, I think show, that it is either a part of Swedish Reef, on One Tree Hill, as yet un opened, or some undiscovered reef in the gully, that has been the source of thi3 gold. Alluvial mining in the other creeks and gullies of the Caledonia gold field, is in the same state as when I last reported, with this exception, that we have an increase in the number of Chinese, as will be seen by the foregoing table. MARYBOROUGH MINING DISTRICT, St. Arnaud Division. (Charles H. Raven, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Alluvial miners ... ... 400 Quartz miners ... ... 350 750 Europeans 520 Chinese 230 At Anderson's Creek, the works of both the companies established there, remain in statu quo, and will probably remain so until the dry weather sets in. On the Emerald gold field about thirty miners are at work on the Sassafras Creek; these are in a state of excitement about the Baw-baw gold field, and talk of leaving for that locality. 1, however, have advised every miner that I met with not to go there yet, as I believe that they must inevitably starve for want of provisions ; and, as 1 stated in my special report, or to the same effect, the miner with only his tools, blankets, and a little money in his pocket has no business there yet ; he will only have to suffer hardship, and have to leave the locality without giving it a trial or himself a fair chance. 750 The machinery is as follows At the Morang diggings on the Plenty River, there are now but ten miners at work, probably making a living. 1 herewith forward a tracing of the sketch map of the country between the Gipps Land road and the Yarra, on which I have laid down approximately the position of the new gold field and the general direction of the track from the Gipps Land road to that lo cality. I have also laid down a proposed track, from a point about 15 miles beyond Dandenong to the new gold field along the dividing range. This track I believe would be very useful for opening up the country between Mount Baw-baw and the Cockatoo I have the honor to forward my report of the St. Arnaud division for the month of September, during which this district slightly increased in population, owing to a small rush having taken place to the Bald or Erwan Hills, many having arrived from Inglewood and elsewhere. In my last report I men tioned the likelihood of this being an exten sive rush, and the same possibility still exists, although from the formation of the hills on which the mining operations are ro.

The yield of gold on this hill does not average above half an ounce to the load, but the driving in the bottom being so remarkably soft, renders the smallness of the yield suffi ciently remunerative to keep those at present at work from leaving. I have not the slight est doubt, that if the wash-dirt from this hill was more systematically treated, the returns would be surprisingly increased : the parties at present at work are leaving an amount of fine gold, the extraction of which, if they had any means at command for so doing, would materially alter for the better their present small remuneration. For the in formation of the Board, and to render my description of fine gold more effective, I have enclosed a small piece of soft white shale (now hard and brown) which is being left overhead in their workings directly under tbe cement and intermixed with quartz boulders, the gold being so thin and fine as to preclude the possibility of saving it by hand ; the en closed piece 1 knocked down myself when I visited tbe prospecting claim, and could see a quantity of the same, all over the roof or back of their drives, as also in many other claims. The country for miles round the neighborhood of these two hills is composed principally of made hills, having every indication of being highly auriferous and nearly wholly untried. The rain during the latter part of this month will prove a bles sing to the alluvial miner in this division, al though from the (otheiwise) splendid drain age in this division they will suffer greatly, as the water passes rapidly away, and leaves them without any provision for the ensuing summer months ; whereas, with a trifling outlay for water reserve this district would, I feel assured, support five times its present population all the year. About fourteen miles from St. Arnaud township, in a S.S.W. direction, a few par ties have been steadily at work for the last twelve months ; from the general appearance of the country and the sample of gold ob tained, there is every probability in its favor of eventually proving a good and payable locality ; all the gold as yet found is coarse, none much smaller than a pea, the largest piece weighing a little over 6 oz. of a good color and quality. I am credibly informed that some enter prising parties have erected a powerful en gine a short distance from the above locality for the purpose of washing the surface, &c, in its immediate neighborhood, and the most casual observer would not fail to believe its being a profitable investment. El Dorado Reef. \u2014 From information I have received 1 understand a company is being formed to erect machinery and work this reef, on the southern portion of which is Messrs. Lewis and Company's claim, the plan and particulars of which I had the honor to forward with my last ; with this report I have also forwarded plan No. 3 of workings on Ballaarat Reef, shown in general sketeh, plan No. 1. Messrs. Walker and Company's Reef is still yielding the same handsome return of 8J oz. per ton. Messrs. Clarke and Company, to the north east, and in the Mallee, have lately had another crushing yielding 2 oz. per ton, the gold being 23 carats fine. Several parties are still prospecting new reefs in the Mallee. and from the appearance of the stone I should say will prove payable, but until they have some crushed I can give no positive information. When I last visited the St. Arnaud Quartz Mining Company's shift at Sebastopol I found they had driven to the east about six feet, at the depth of 100 feet, and struck the reef on its underlay ; they have not yet broken into it, consequently I cannot say as to its thickness, but I can speak with certainty as to its containing gold, having seen the color on the western face, but in what quantity the mass could be made to yield is uncertain from such a doubtful guide. Reference to plan of longitudinal section of Ballaarat Reef. Plan HI.\u2014 This reef, as shown on plan I, forwarded last month, is situate on the northern slope of the next hill south of Wilson's Hill. The El Dorado Reef, when it reaches the southern fall of Wilson's Hill, splits off into several leaders and reefs which continue down this slope, and appa rently immediately rise again on this, form ing the Ballaarat, Chrysolite, and other reefs, but of this formation I cannot speak with certainty until the shaft or claim marked A, in plan III., is more thoroughly tried ; as yet there is every reason to believe they are one and the same, the character of the stone and the metals contained therein being exactly alike in all, the direction and course of reef being similar, and there being likewise many faults or breaks in the one corresponding exactly with those in the other. Another peculiar feature in its character being the regular streaks of payable stone which are here, as also in the El Dorado Reef, found to continue from the surface exactly in the same angle on its norther strike to below the water level, or as far as worked. Without the reef altering in appearance or character of its quartz, the gold suddenly ceases to be payable beyond certain lines, these are shown exactly as sound at No. I.

To the north of No 1, or south of No. 2, no payable stone can be obtained; and to the north of No. 3, or south of No. 4 is precisely the same. When sinking the shaft marked C the quartz was found to average 3 oz. per ton, from surface to below water-level, and the average of all the quartz taken out as shown on plan, was 2\u00a3 oz per ton. The whole of this mass of quartz was taken out and crushed in three months, the shaft having been first sunk. In claim 4, with shaft marked F., situate between the lines marked No. 3, and No. 4, the quartz was equally good, although not so thick. Between these two shafts, others have been sunk marked D and E., as also driven as in the shaft marked D at M ; but in neither instance could payable gold bediscovered outside these lines, although the reef continued its general thickness throughout, except as at L in shaft C where it increased to twice its thickness, or to 5 feet. At the water-level the yield of gold gra dually commenced to decrease, until from 4\"; oz., it reached 1 oz. 8 dwt., although this was compensated for, as far as being remune rative, by the reef increasing in width, but the quantity of water, and the peculiartreacherous nature of the country, prevented it then being further worked, in the claim or shaft marked C. In the shaft marked A the parties are still at work, and are now very near the payable stone, on its dip in the line of direction, and if, with the whims at present at work, they are enabled to overcome the water, they will, I have no doubt prove beyond a doubt, whether this is one and the same reef as the El Dorado or otherwise.

(Robert Davidson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Since the date of my last report so little has been done, beyond the ordinary workings of the various claims on the several leads in this division, that I find myself at a loss for any new matter to report upon. Reports being required by your Board monthly, repetitions of the same things of necessity frequently occur, which I hope will not be attributed to any inattention or want of energy on my part, but is entirely chargeable to the nature of the mining in this division. Deep sinking, such as is now being carried on upon Bal laarat, is work of such magnitude, and so long a time is occupied in tracing the course of these leads any great distance, it is clear the discoveries of a month, while they may sensi bly affect the escort returns, can do but little towards the furtherance of science. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The Leads. \u2014 The Inkermann Lead. \u2014 The Allied Armies Company is still at work in the old lead, and in addition they are prospecting for a quartz reef which they expect to find passing through their claim. The Great Re public Company is in full work again, having quite recovered from the effects of the late swamping out. The Hand-in-Hand Company are still extending their works to the west ward. The Southern Cross Company are still sinking, but have not yet reached the required depth. Nothing more has been ascertained respectingthe course of the Inkermann gutter, but there appears to be no doubt in the minds a2 Europeans.

The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Golden Point Lead. \u2014 The Cosmopo litan Company continues to obtain excellent yields of gold. The Koh-i-noor Company is still engaged in putting in the main level referred to in my last. The Nightingale Lead.\u2014 The Great West ern Company is still at work, though it is thought by some that they will shortly be worked out. The Malakhoff Lead.\u2014 The Triumphant Company is still engaged in working the old ground, and it is paying good dividends. The British Company is paying very poorly. The Great Eastern Company is obtaining good wages from the alluvial ground, but have not yet met with the quartz reef which they expect to find in their claim. The Milkmaid's Lead. \u2014 The Burra Burra are doing well in the alluvial ground, and are making preparations for the erection of a very powerful stamping battery, for the purpose of working their quartz reef. During the month of October the state of mining in general was not very lively. Want of funds compelled many of the com panies to hold their claims in reserve until they had acquired sufficient means to pro secute further, but towards the end of the month matters assumed a far better ap pearance. The Redan Lead.\u2014 The Golden Gate Com pany is still doing well, though the yields since my last report have not been so good as were then reported. The Great Extended Company are carrying on very extensive operations, and are obtaining good dividends. The Frenchman's Lead \u2014 The Albion Com pany are still driving in the same direction as when I wrote last, and are in a similar kind of bed-rock. No new indications of the deep ground have been discovered. The Black Hill still continues to yield good dividends, and some of the small companies are preparing to erect crushing machines for themselves, as they consider the price of crushing (15s. per ton) too high. Large and capacious dams and reservoirs are in course of construction in the various gullies in the vicinity to preserve as much water as pos sible for this purpose, but the water shed being too small to yield a permanent supply in the dry season, they will be compelled to use water totally unfit for gold washing, or adopt the alternative of remaining idle. Sago Hill. \u2014 Several of the companies have worked out and abandoned their claims; some three or four companies, however, continue to do exceedingly well. The search for the continuation of this lead has been entirely abandoned. Campbell's Gully.\u2014 The several sluicing and puddling companies in this gully con tinue to do well, and there is every proba bility they will do so while the supply of water continues good. On the Yorkshire Reef the West Riding Company, reorganized, are now at a depth of 1 30 feet in their new shaft, and are preparing to erect crushing machinery in connection with their claim. Next to them, the Living stone Company, late Yorkshire Company, have a large quantity of quartz raised, from which they expect a good return as soon as they have machinery of their own. On Little Bendigo, the Band of Hope Reef is considered the best, although better yields have been obtained from other reefs in the locality. The Band of Hope Company on this reef obtained from their last crushing of 90 tons of quartz 36 oz. 7 dwt. of gold. They have now sunk to the depth of 120 feet in their new shaft, which is situated about 25 feet eastward of the reef.

I believe that jEIOOO has been refused for a share in this claim. The dividends of the company for the last four week's crushing amounted to \u00a372 per man, after paying all expenses, and now that they are in complete working order they expect the future yield to double the former. I send you by this post some zircons which I myself found in Mount Blackwood Creek. These kind of stones are very nu merous in the Mount Blackwood and Jim Crow Creeks, and some have been found in the Gravel Pits and Eureka Leads on Ballaarat. Northward there are many companies searching for the reef, and are very sanguine as to its speedy discovery. To the south the Hope Company, No. 1, are holding their claim in reserve. Want of capital prevents them from proceeding, and though they have obtained a yield of 12 dwt. per ton at their trial crushing, they are yet unable to obtain machinery, being willing to accept even \u00a3300 for their claim (300 by 500 feet), whereas the adjacent claims could not be purchased for five times that amount. No. 3 Division, (Thomas Cowan, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Sisters' Company, No. 2, south, have discovered the reef, and intend to sink to the depth of 150 feet, 120 of which they have already sunk through. Next in order is the Temperance Company's claim, No. 3. The reef has been struck in this claim, and the company are preparing to erect a steam engine of 25 horse-power for crushing. For the present they merely intend to use two batteries. Still south is the Cr\u0153sus Com pany's claim, the last in which the reef has been found; no trial has yet been made, but the company are satisfied with the appear. ance of the reef. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Surprise Company, on the Enterprise Reef, in following the course of their old drive have discovered a large number of very valuable specimens. They are endeavoring to enlarge the company for the purpose of acquiring funds for the purchase of ma chinery. The promises of the Monte Christo Com pany's claim seem likely to be realised. From their last week's crushing of upwards of 200 tons of quartz they obtained 50oz. of gold. This appears to come from the con tinuation of the lode in which Hough and Company obtained 27 Ibs. of gold about 3^ years since. The greater part of the gold is found in the schist and slate, and in the quartz closely adjoining it, so that a large quantity of the casing is crushed with the stone. * Five In course of erection, Since the last report forwarded by me there has been but little change in the mining opera- tions within my district. The various quartz mining companies con tinue to work on steadily, and, on the whole, with very fair results ; but owing to the short time that the majority of them have been at work, I am unable to report as to the average vield from the whole number of claims ; but J. . . ., . r .: 1 c ls- con- The Horn of Plenty Company, on the Dreamer's Reef, discovered a rich lode last week, and the price of shares consequently increased from \u00a325 to \u00a380.

In alluvial mining I have still no change to report, the different puddling companies con tinuing to carry on their operations with about the average success. The Prince Albert Company, in Specimen Gully, have recently obtained some better quartz, and are now in good hopes that their claim will prove remunerative. Their first crushings were extremely poor, but the quartz obtained in the new shaft promises to be of far better quality than that taken from tho old one. In the neighborhood of Golden Point and the White Flat a very large number of pud dling companies are still at work, their opera tions consisting of paddocking. The ground is usually washed from the surface to the bed-rock, and a number of steam engines are employed in working the puddling machines. Several of these companies have been at work for more than two years, and they have still a large quantity of ground left. Their opera tions however have been greatly retarded by several floods, which have compelled them to lose much time in pumping the water out of the claims. This grouud could only be pro perly worked by the aid of steam machinery and systematic arrangements, for the average yield of gold is so small that it is only by great economy in labor and the putting through of large quantities of earth that a remunerative result is obtained. The Speedwell Company, on the Poverty Point lode, have started their battery of twelve stamps since my last report. Their first week's crushing gave them 25 oz. of gold, besides a large quantity of amalgum. They are now sinking a new shaft iu order to get a large supply of quartz. The Last Chance Company, in Specimen Gully, are carrying on their works in the new shaft with every promise of striking the lode again before long. They recently obtained some veins con taining gold, and now believe they are not very far off the main lode which they formerly worked. The Clydeside Company, on the White Flat, have been at work in the old ground for a considerable time, and are now realizing from \u00a32 10s. to \u00a33 per man weekly. The Enterprise Company, on the Gum Tree Flat, recently divided \u00a346 per man for some what more than a fortnight's work. The Llanberris Company, on the same locality, have sunk their second shaft to a depth of 200 feet, and are raising quartz from a level somewhat higher. Their dividends have been about the average given in former reports. The Cornish Company below have had a great deal of water to contend with, and have not averaged more than \u00a32 per man weekly. This company have struck a very promising quartz lode on the side of the hill. The Glasgow Company, at the lower part of the White Flat, were swamped out some few months since, and had to pump for four teen weeks before the claim was freed from the water ; but they are now earning about \u00a33 per week, after paying some heavy ex penses. This company have also struck a quartz lode in their claim. The other quartz companies in my district continue to earn about the average amount as already given, and the yield continues to keep about the same as in former returns, Creswick Division. On Golden Point there are several parties prospecting for quartz lodes, and in two claims very promising ones have been obtained. (James Stevenson, Mining Surveyor.) There are several engine parties at work in this locality, and a number of Chinese. The paddocking and puddling operations here carried on have given dividends of from \u00a33 to \u00a34 per week a man, whilst in some cases they have been much larger. The population is as follows: \u2014 Since my report the Danish Company have started their battery of twelve stamps on the old Post-office lode.

The Clunes Company's mine is now dry again, and the lower workings are being carried on as heretofore. The number of miners cast out of employment are again at work. Increased energy is apparent here, to conduct quartz mining. I have surveyed off three fresh claims for this purpose, and one other on North Clunes to work the alluvial Criterion Company. \u2014 In my last, having reported their crushing results up to the 6th October, I am now only able to record their operations to the 20th ultimo.

The Tort Phillip Company, from the 5th of October to the 17th, crushed 904 tons, which yielded 417 oz. 4 dwt , and for the week end ing 25th October, 415 tons, which yielded 390 oz. 10 dwt., averaging per ton 12 dwt. 6 gr. The quantity of quartz crushed is below the usual amount, owing to delay consequent on the hiuderance to the supply suffered by the Clunes Company referred to, and latterly the non use of the No. 2 battery, the beds of which had given way, but are now securely repaired. The silvered copper plates for this battery have also been lengthened. I may mention that the adoptiou of these plates, referred to in my April report, answer well, and have given much satisfaction. The fol lowing details, which show the results of the last fortnight's crushing by the No. 4 battery, from 291 tons 15 cwt. of stone, may be con sidered to represent the value of the seveial appliances for securing the gold. The exact yields of gold cannot, however, be stated j but from frequent test, the produce from the amalgam is known to approximate the figures stated : \u2014 Clunes United Company have opened out a chamber in the new main shaft, at 150 feet, and commenced driving for the reefs. Tbe pumping gear (pipes of six inches diameter) which was put out of order by the late acci dent is repaired \u2014 itisworked by twotravelling bobs. The new engine is very solidly fixed, and the boiler also in stone, the flue is of brickwork, being the first of the kind at this place. From the late inroad of water to this mine the company have lost their old drives, tramways, trucks, and many tools ; but as they had contemplated working at a deeper level, the loss is less important than at one time expected. Pending the completion of arrangements, they are now crushing and amalgamating the alluvial deposits carted from the Young Sons of Freedom Company. Their high-level tramway to convey the quartz raised from the new shaft to the battery, appears to be a substantial affair; it is not yet completed.

I am unable, owing to a change of management of this company, to give more detailed returns: a junction of the reef already referred to has not as yet been proved. From the blankets, 2 oz. 7 dwt. At the foot of the strikes, another amalga mating box \u2014 through which the reduced stone passes \u2014 is more particularly useful when washing down.

Trewhella's Reef. \u2014 This reef lies about 14 chains to the eastward of Hewson's, and runs parallel to it. It is perhaps the most im portant of any other yet discovered in this locality. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Trewhella's claim on this reef has been and still is paying exceedingly well, but how well I am not at liberty to state, from an unwillingness on their part to publish. The Pioneer Company, adjoining Trewhella's on the north, are getting a fair profit. Their machinery for crushing and pumping is very complete, and works well. Sherwood and Company, on the same reef, to the south, have to contend with a good deal of water, and will not be able, I am afraid, to go on prosperously without ma chinery. The adjoining claim to the south of this is now the United Company's. This claim was at first worked by parties who expended a good deal of money upon it, but the great enemy to mining (water), and being unable to provide machinery to master it, forced them to abandon the mine. It has since this been taken up by some Germans, and an attempt made to drain the mine by means of a horse-whim, but it has failed, and they are now, they say, going to erect a steam engine as soon as possible, and are about applying for an extension of ground for a lease. I have the honor to forward herewith a plan of part of these diggings, extending from Sebastopol Hill to the Camp or Court house, showing all the races, and the dwell ings, &c, as far as I have yet surveyed. It is my intention to follow up this survey, to include all tbe quartz reefs and the operations thereon, with the principal gullies where alluvial mining is mostly carried on. Barry's Reef. \u2014 Nothing worth naming has been done on this reef during the past month, tbe principal reason given being, want of water to drive their water-wheel. A fresh claim has been taken up by other parties, who are only just commencing. Quartz Mining. \u2014 About five weeks ago a quartz reef, called Newman's Reef, was dis covered, lying to the southward of Simmons Reef \u2014 and unquestionaly one of this group \u2014 has been opened in a prospecting claim, and 22 tons of quartz have been crushed, which produced 40 oz. of gold. Johnson's Reef\u2014 The \" Early Bird,\" now the \" Caledonian \" Company, have been working to some purpose since they began here, the yield of gold from their crushings having been full 2 oz. to the ton of quartz. This claim was taken up by the present parties after it bad been abandoned by others who had spent about \u00a32000 with little or no return, and left it in despair, if not disgust. The present holders, as a preliminary move, sunk the shaft about six sect deeper, and struck into auriferous quartz that has paid them handsomely. Two other claims have been taken up on this reef, but neither has as yet reached the quartz ; their shafts are down about 30 feet. Hewson's Reef. \u2014 This also is a newly discovered reef, lying to the northward of Simmons Reef. It is now being worked by Hewson and party. They have erected a steam engine with four stampers on the ground, and the yield from the first crushing was at the rate of 7 dwt. of gold to the ton of quartz; but they have, I understand, ex ceeded this since.

They are going on under promising prospects, and some fine specimens have been taken out. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 There is nothing particular to state as to the older companies on Simmons Reef; no change has taken place in these except a few transfers of shares during the month of Octo ber. They are going on they say, producing what they chose to call a fair average. Alluvial Mining. \u2014 These diggings generally have been going on productively, although there are some \u2014 as there always will be \u2014 complaining. The late floods have done some damage by inundating some claims, but on the other hand it has been productive of benefit by scouring away the refuse stuff lodged in the gullies and creeks and laying bare many spots from which at present gold is being obtained ; and upon the whole I think I am right in saying that these diggers are doing better than they have been for some time. The increased amount of the escort for the last fortnight seems to me to be con firmatory of the conclusion I have arrived at, it being 633 oz. against less than 300 oz. a little while ago, and if all the gold obtained at Blackwood was sent by escort the amount would be nearly, if not quite, doubled to what it now appears to be. This district has been favored with a good supply of rain for last month which will be of the greatest benefit in continuing the supply of water to a late period in the summer months. In consequence of number 1 and 2 claims on the German Lead in Bowman's Forest, having bottomed and getting very good prospects (nearly 3 oz. to an oil can in one instance), there has been a little excitement and a small rush, though not nearly so much as if it had been anywhere else, in consequence of the various disappointments that have taken place in connection with this part of the district.

The prospectors' claim however continues very payable if not rich, they are washing out from 3 dwt. to 11 dwt. per load ; the other two claims have not yet bottomed. Sluicing operations are being carried on on other parts of Morse's Creek and the Ovens River with fair results generally. Water is abundant, and in many instances the miners have in formed me that they are making very good wages. On the upper part of the western fork of the Buckland River a few payable claims have been opened since my last report, audit is expected that a considerable amount of ground will be found payable on this portion of the river, which hitherto has been but little prospected. In the few places tried on this part of the Buckland no prospects have been obtained before sufficiently payable for the old system of working ; and no water race commanding the ground, sluicing could not be tried. Good ground having now been discovered, it is proposed to cut another race from the river, high enough up the stream to command a large extent of ground in this locality. The gold obtained is coarse. There have been no additional discoveries of quartz viens during October, but most of the reefs continue prosperous and although there has been no very rich quartz from any large reef crushed lately, the general yield is sufficiently good to induce the belief that this will be a permanently prosperous reefing district. On the lower part of the Buckland, all the claims in the river and lower flats have been flooded out, there having been a very heavy fall in the early part of the month, and the river was higher than it has been for three years before. These claims are, however, again working. On the higher ground sluic ing operations are being carried on .with generally good returns, and race owners especially, always making fair wages, con sidering the number of miners. I do not think there is any falling off in the yield of the Buckland River part of the district. A considerable amount of gold leaves by private hands, so that the escort returns do not fairly represent the yield. On the Oriental Reef the quartz is improv ing, that from the prospectors' claim having averaged 3 oz per ton ; from No. 1 South, 4 oz. per ton ; from No, 2 South, no quartz has been crushed as the company are now erecting their own machinery. The quartz from the Victoria Reef has been crushed and yielded 2 oz 5 dwt. per ton and that now being raised appears likely to yield better. On the Nelson Reef the company there working have just completed their new ma chinery and will commence crushing im mediately ; the quartz from their claim con tinues to improve, judging from the increased amount of gold visible in it. \u2014 The party who were prospecting on the reef near Clear Creek have abandoned their claim as the quartz did not continue to show enough gold lower down, to induce them to go on with it They are now prospecting another vein in the same locality. From the Duke of Northumberland, situate between the Oriental and the Hampton, a parcel of 6 tons has been crushed for a trial ; it was taken from the entire bulk of the vein, and at a depth of about 40 feet ; it yielded 5 oz. per ton. The vein is about two feet in thickness. Another trial crushing from the Ulster Reef, situate between the White Star and the Pioneer, yielded 11 oz. 5 dwt. per ton. This was 5 tons of surface quartz ; there is, how ever, no solid reef yet, but a mass of leaders mixed with pipeclay and slate. Scarcely any additional work has been done by the party prospecting the reef on Maquire's Flat owing to the very heavy amount of sur face water they have to conte,nd with at present. 1 do not think they will succeed in sinking their shaft without the aid of ma chinery. Messrs. Gauder and Company inform me that from 31 tons the yield has been a little above 4 oz. per ton, and 3 oz. per ton from a larger crushing ; most of this quartz came from a depth of from 60 to 70 feet. The newly discovered alluvial workings on Morse's Creek are proceeding hut slowly, the prosppctors' claim and the two adjoining being the only ones working at present ; this is in consequence of there having been such heavy The new machine on Richardson's Reef has commenced working, and the quartz crushed from the prospectors' claim during the first week yielded 6 oz. per ton ; and as it was"], [478, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPOETS \u2014 OCTOBEE. 286 taken promiscuously from a heap of about 800 already raised, this yield is likely to be maintained, especially as the reef at the depth of 90 feet continues to look equally well ; at this depth the reef is three feet wide.

Hart, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 On the Ebenezer Reef the prospectors (Messrs. Perry and Co.) have also started their machinery, and had three days crushing; at present the yield cannot be fairly stated, as a considerable quantity of gold was pro bably lost \u2014 as much as 2 gr. to the dish being obtained at times from the tailings; the amount of gold retorted was about 3 oz. per ton. Messrs. Mackay's machine, on the Ovens River, has also been in operation during the last fortnight, and has been crushing a parcel of 100 tons from Falkner's Reef. The yield of this claim has fallen short of that antici pated, being only 1 oz. 10 dwt. per ton ; this quartz was taken from the cap of the reef, principally. The above yield, although not large, is sufficient to pay good wages to a working party. The vein is from ten inches to a soot in width ; it has also been struck in No. 1 North. The other two claims to the southward arc not working at present. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Messrs. Mackay's machine will commence on the 5th November to crush a large parcel of stone from the Lisbon Reef. The Golden Bar Reef, which had been abandoned, has been taken up by Rossiter, Wallace, and Company, and named the Pennyweight Reef. A small yield would pay well to this company, this being a large vein, and situated on low ground within a mile of their own machinery. I have the honor to lay before the Board of Science the annexed tabular statement for the month of September, 1860; as it is but little more than a fortnight since the last report, no difference except in the number of puddling mills has come under my notice. The yield of gold from the reefs in this division is decidedly on the increase, and some of the claims that have been making only wages are becoming excessively remu nerative. The Catherine Reef is now vying with the far-famed Johnson in the richness of its quartz. In my last report I stated that the Catherine Reef Company (Keith's) had struck very good stone. I am now in a posi tion to state that the last yield from that stone was 34! oz. to 23 tons of quartz. I have seen some of it on the ground, and from its appearance I have no doubt of it. The claim of Burgoyne and Company on the same line of reef, a few hundred feet to the south of the former, is said to be still better. The No more payable quartz has yet been struck on Mead's Reef. On the Elgin the claims are at present flooded out, in consequence of surface drain age. I have no additional report to make yet respecting the other reefs ; prospecting and raising quartz is being actively carried on in most of the claims, but none has been crushed during October from any but those above mentioned. I am now engaged in a survey of the Buckland River, in order to furnish plans of the alluvial workings. iuropeans. lesc.

The Catherine therefore may, considering its great length, be classed among the most important reefs in the district. this reef consists entirely of quartz veins or spurs, the whole breadth of which in No. 7 workings is sound to be about 50 feet from east to west, by about 12 feet in depth. In No. 8, about 30 feet in width, the depth being the same as in the former. In shaft No. 6 the breadth is reduced to about 7 feet, and to 6 feet in depth. The only remarkable fact is that a gradual increase in thickness is observable from west to east, the most westerly being the thinnest. They traverse the sandstone (micaceous) in all directions, but with a general tendency to underlie to the west. In one shaft only (No. 2) is slate observable ; the last few feet have been sunk through blue talcose slate, somewhat soft and easily broken. The Prince of Wales Company, on the reef of the same name, is also rising. This com pany is at present sinking a fine shaft; it is well timbered throughout, and a 10 horse power engine is being put up near it solely for the purpose of winding. I believe it is the only one in the district entirely devoted to that purpose. The works of this company are very extensive, and every means is re sorted to by the proprietors to develope to the utmost the resources at their command. The like vigor is more or less apparent in every part of this division. I have subjoined a sketch taken under ground in workings No. 8, showing very nearly the position and appearance of the veins, but the smaller ones are much more numerous than I have represented them, and very thin, many being not more than half an inch thick, the thickest about 15 inches. At present the company is working the hundred feet levels in both shafts, the lower levels being abandoned for a time, in consequence of soul air and water. As all the other shafts shown on the four chain plan have nothing of very great interest in them, being merely perpendicular shafts, with drives run ning from them at right angles in different directions, I have not considered it necessary to give plans of them, as they can be quite as easily understood by a written description. They are as follows :\u2014 The alluvial mining is also improving, as in general I hear very good accounts from the puddlers, &c. The new lead at Huntly still continues to bear towards the Main Huntly Lead, with which it will be most probably connected. Between this and the next month, I propose making a survey of it, as it is now a very important portion of the alluvial workings, and worthy of being brought under the notice of the Board of Science. A large nugget, said to weigh 90 oz., has been found in the Whipstick, only 6 inches below the surface ; but the locality is unknown, at least so I have been informed. No. 1. Depth 100 feet (sandstone). No drives. No. 2. Depth 180 feet (sandstone and slate). Drives\u2014 At 175 feet, 78 feet to east. I have also the honor of submitting to the Board of Science the accompanying drawings of certain claims on the Shelback Reef, the principal workings on which belong to the Shelback Company. As the yield of gold from this reef has never yet been very great, the amount of work done by the proprietors proves their energy and perseverence ; and I think I am right in remarking that in no workings have I seen better or more efficient timbering than I have observed in this claim.

The cap of the long looked for reef in claim No. 1, Mariner's, has at length been struck at a depth of 430 feet, but as yet, I am unable to forward any de tails as to its character. Since the fortunate discovery, both claimholders and shareholders in the Maryborough Company have indulged in unusual ecstacies, the latter by a previously attested agreement being entitled (for pump ing the water) to one-eighth of the proceeds from No. 1, clear of all expenses.

In the other, at a distance of 4 chains, the leader was also discovered on surface and is equally as thick as the former. At a depth of 25 feet, were found specimens, 30 oz. of which realized 28 oz. of gold; after this the average yield is only 2J oz. per ton. In alluvial mining there has been recently nothing fresh, hut this dullness has been in a great measure compensated for by an occa sional excitement on the discovery of some new and promising quartz reef.

Kangaroo Flat. \u2014 A rush on an extensive scale took place about a fortnight ago near the head of this flat, in consequence of some miners discovering very ricli ground in a branch gully running in a westerly direction. From the fine prospects obtained by the few who were first on the ground a large rush was the result. It is to be regretted however that the majority of those who rushed with the expectation of getting golden claims have been disappointed, as the lead is confined to a few hundred yards; it is bounded on each side by old workings. Many of those first on the ground have been very fortunate in obtaining claims that are yielding from $ oz. to 2 oz. to the tub ; occasionally nuggets are discovered varying from 1 oz. to 12 oz. The sinking is from 4 to 12 feet, through clay, sand, and gravel, with but very few quartz boulders. * This engine has been recently erected t This engine has been idle during tho month. Quartz Mining. \u2014 In this pursuit matters have not looked better lor a considerable period. On the Musical Reef, Amherst, the Whitehaven Company have 800 tons of stone on the surface ready lor crushing : they have had 300 tons of stone crushed lately, which averaged 13$ dwt. to the ton. The depth of they1 shaft is 140 feet, and dry ; the lode is from 3 to 8 feet in thickness. Within the last month a new reef has been discovered near Mount Greenock. The prospectors have had crushed 11 tons of stone, which averaged 3 oz. 15 dwt. to the ton. The reef is termed the Caruubian. A few days ago a party who were working an alluvial claim amongst the old workings on Ballaarat Hill, discovered a quartz reef in which gold is plainly visible ; 3 tons of the stone have been crushed, and yielded 3 oz. 15 dwt. From present ap pearances, the lode is from 3 to 7 feet in thickness. I have the honor to report, that during this moutli a steam engine of 16 horsepower has been erected close to the creek on the lease known as \" Magonagles ;\" its position is shown on the accompanying plan. I have numbered the engines in the table according to their distance from the crescent, this en gine being the nearest I call No. 1, No. 7 is close to the township of Amherst. As will be seen from the tables showing the number of the population engaged in alluvial mining, a slight decrease has taken place owing, in a certain degree, to the rush near Ararat, and in a great measure to the decision lately given in the Court of Mines by his Honor Judge Clarke, to the effect that the frontage sys-teni in this district is illegal ; owing to the latter cir cumstance mining operations are compara tively at a standstill on the Rocky Flat and Rocky Point frontage leads, many miners who had not the means of stopping till the dis pute would be finally settled have left in con sequence for other places. A lease of 10 acres has been applied for by Messrs. Samuels, Brown, and Wrigley, on the Staffordshire Reef. Parties have objected to the granting thereof. The objection will be heard before the warden shortly. From the various other reefs in the division there is nothing of any importance to report. Many of them are registered for a period of three months, principally through the want of suf ficient funds to enable the owners to work them to advantage. Many of those registered have attained a considerable depth, and in most cases water, to a great extent, is to be contended with. The legality or otherwise of the frontage system is to be tried shortly in the Supreme Court, where it is hoped it will be decided one way or the other. Scandinavian Lead. \u2014 Mining operations on this lead are still carried on with great vigor, and from what can be judged from the last shafts bottomed there appears to be no falling off in tbe yield; it takes a considerable time to bottom a shaft owing to the laborious nature of the sinking.

On the Avoca proper I have no change in mining matters to report since my last. At Lamplough the mining population is rather on the increase. Numbers, being dis appointed with the prospects obtained at the Londonderry (Ararat) rush, are returning, and appear disposed to settle in this district, partially attracted by the news of payable ground being obtainable at the Woodstock rush. This rush is situated about two miles from Lamplough, on the Lexton road, and was occasioned by a party of three hair dressers having struck gold in paying quan tities upon the surface, which eventual ly has been traced into thirty-feet sinking, and consequently called Barbers' Gully. Several claims are working very payable ground, which so far is only one claim wide, but with two and three feet thickness of wash-dirt. The plan (No. 1 ) that I send you this month is connected with the plan oflast month at the south-east end of Scandinavian Crescent, and shows the diggings as far as the end of Bal laarat Hill. Plan No. 2 is likewise connected with that oflast month at the north-west end of Ballaarat street, and shows the diggings as far as the head of the Mysterious Lead. Accompanying the plans are vertical sections A, B, and C. Section A represents the vari ous strata on Good Woman's Hill ; B, those on Ballaarat Hill; and section C, those in Nos. 3 and 4 Amalgamated Claim, on Rocky Point, or, as it is likewise termed, Union Lead. The prospectors wash from six to eighteen inches thick of the surface, which yields, on an average, half an ounce to the load. Four men wash nine loads daily; and the day pre vious to my visiting their working, they informed me that a pound weight of gold was the result of that day's work, and that from some loads of dirt two and three ounces were obtained. Avoca Division. (Robert English, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 This rich yield of surfacing has induced others to prospect the adjacent hills and gullies, resulting in another payable narrow lead being discovered, running nearly pa rallel to the Barbers' Gully, and expected eventually to converge with the same, before reaching Messrs. Clough und Co.'s purchased property, which now is distant only twenty claims from the last claim getting payable gold. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The proprietors, through their agent, have offered terms to the miners to work the ground, should gold be sound within their boundary, and with which terms the miners appear to be perfectly satisfied \u2014 viz., \u00a32 for each claim of forty feet square, \u00a31 of which to be returned when the claims are worked and the holes filled up again. The configuration of this part of the district with its rocky surface is a sac simile of the Back Creek district, and my impression is that an extensive payable gold field in this particular locality has yet to be de veloped.

A num ber of miners having sold their claims lately will add to our few unemployed, but being possessed of a little capital entertain hopes of making up for the loss of the old claims by the discovery of some good reef, among the many as hitherto untried ones. At the Sebastopol Reef the St. Arnaud Mining Company have commenced breaking through the reef, at the depth of 100 feet; as they are now only two feet into it no criterion can be formed of its general yield. On the eastern slope of this hill some very good specimens have been lately found. Since I had the honor to forward my last monthly report, the population in my division has slightly decreased, owing to rushes having occurred at Black Range, Ararat, and at Kingower, those having left for either of the above places, being alluvial miners only; Wilson's Hill has at last been taken posses sion of by the capitalists; for the last year negotiations have been pending for the pur chase of this property, but hitherto the holders of claims have refused to sell, as much as .\u00a36000 being, at one time, asked for the hill. and part only of those who flocked to the small alluvial rush at the Erivan Hill, St. Arnaud.

This with the general low yield of gold lately found, seldom averag ing above 8 or 10 dwt. to the load, is but little inducement for alluvial miners to stay when other rushes occur, although from this being obtainable in nearly every place, as yet but poorly tried, seldom fails to bring them back agaiu when other places cease to prove remunerative.

The population is as follows : \u2014 The Cumberland Reef Company is com mencing to realize the expectations of its shareholders ; from a lode 10 to 12 feet wide they have been obtaining $ oz. per ton, and last week a quantity of quartz obtained from leaders yielded above 1 oz. per ton. The Old Quartz Hill Company are continu ing to extract from 60 to 70 oz. per week. The Cappers Reef Company have just issued their by-monthly report, setting down for two months ending 24tb October, \u00a3945 realized from quartz crushed. The machinery is as follows :\u2014 The Old Specimen Gully are improving and anticipating a dividend. The Fortuna Company is being re-consti tuted and its sphere of operations enlarged so as to erect crushing machinery. The affairs of the Bolivia Company are in the hands of Judge Bindon of the Court of Mines; and the Wattle Gully Company having expended their capital are at present in a somewhat lifeless position. A new reef opened near the southern town boundary has struck payable gold, and several deposits of alluvial gold has been found on the hills and sides of old workings, giving a greater impetus to mining operations. Among instances of individual success I note Blanket Hill cement yielding 4 oz. per ton. Grose of the Bolivia Reef 6 oz. per ton. No particular change or improvement in mining operations has occurred during the month worthy of record ; in alluvial mining One claim in Wattle Gully 3 oz. 4 dwt. per ton, other claims on those workings yielding their usual average of 18 to 22 dwt per ton ; and from Trapps Reef, where a tunnel was driven and shafts sunk within a few inches of the gold and then abandoned, parties are now realizing 2 oz. 11 dwt. per ton. One puddling machine, too, in alluvial work ings, Wattle Gully, has for several weeks past averaged for four men \u00a3100 per week. the puddlers have been fully employed, and by working from sunrise to sunset are generally realizing a comfortable subsistence, but the tub aud cradle men find very great difficulty in obtaining the scantiest living, consequently their numbers are becoming less, finding it more advantageous to get employment on the railway, roads, &c, at a regular wage.

I have the assurance of those gentlemen and other reefers on Post Office Hill, that in no case have they ever found gold in the sandstone; but as they have numerous little veins and leaders of auriferous quartz permeating the sandstone, they find it more advantageous to excavate and crush the whole rather than pick out the quartz separately. with the exception of two claims Nos. 1 and 2. From claim No. 1 the last crushing was 2 oz. 11J dwt. per ton, the refuse stone being crushed by neighboring mill owners yielding 3 dwt. per ton ; the surface alluvial on those claims is also being worked and is payable. A plan formerly sent shows the situation of this reef on the east side of Wattle Gully; the accompanying sections, showing the posi tion relatively to adjacent reefs and rocks, will, I think, account for its disposition, as the range rises considerably both to the east and south, with outcropping reefs of sandstone and quartz. I hope this report will be deemed satis factory in accounting for the discovery of the gold in the sandstone. Although very de sirous for the development of our natural resources, I should be still more anxious not to mislead or cause a waste of time and labor on non-productive rocks, and so far as this division is yet prospected, quartz appears to be the only original matrix for gold. Referring to your circular (No. 60 | 3235), I have the honor to report that minerals of value \u2014 as diamonds, &c. \u2014 have not been dis covered in the Castlemaine division. Since first reported, fine veins of ferruginous quartz have been discovered in the sandstone, and Prior's party are now sinking, following a leader in exp\u00bbctation of finding a reef. Another quartz vein, 2 feet thick, bearing 5\u00b0 28' S.E., and underlaying easterly, has been opened only 28 feet easterly from the sand stone workings, which have nearly the same bearing (4\u00b0 20' S.E.) and on the crown of the range easterly, a large reef presents itself on surface, the adjacent rocks being sandstone. Since receiving your circular, I have re ceived a visit from Mr. G. M, Stephen, to whom I submitted my cabinet, which com prises all specimens I have been able to collect in seven years and a half surveying and mining in this division. I have his authority to state that no stone of commercial value exists among them, nor do I think it probable that any such stones exist in connection with the gold drifts of this division, as tbe bedding and outcropping rocks and adjacent ranges are almost unexceptioually of the clay-slate and sandstone formation, intersected with quartz dikes only, and such precious stones would more probably be found among the debris of primary or trap formations in Mount Alexander, at the extreme south-west of Campbell's Creek, being the only likely posi tion. After careful investigation, I am of opinion that the matrix sandstone is of recent deposit, and that it received its metal from abrasion of the quartz reef above it. The sections will show it to be deposited in irregular laminated layers, nearly horizontal, thickly permeated with veins, and its position with an underlay west 73\u00b0 20', and having a slate westerly wall, against which it beds, whilst easterly there is a depth of argillaceous alluvium and quartz debris, which affords strong proof of its origin, and I believe will soon prove to be non auriferous, or lead to a quartz reef. I have instituted inquiry into other cases of auriferous sandstone publicly reported as having been sound in this division. The spe cimen found by Mr. Walker, machinist, is a very compact sandstone, but the gold is on the face of the stone, and not a particle is dis cernible when the stone has been broken. It was found at Golden Point, below a rich reef and alluvial workings, and most probably at one time formed a portion of facinn- wall to the Trapps Reef. The only minerals of commercial value as yet discovered in this division are granite, sandstone, flagging, and argill, for building purposes : bluestone, greywacke, and quartz, for road metal ; a good specimen of fibrous gypsum was lately sound at Campbell's Creek, but whether occurring in payable quantities is not yet ascertained ; the same mineral is sometimes found in our quartz reefs, in which we also find sulphurets and oxydes of iron, manganese, copper, and galena, the galena and iron being most intimately connected with the deposition of gold, and often found associating together. The auriferous sandstone on the eastern side of the British American Reef is sound between the quarlz lode and its foot-wall. It is of a^ friable arenaceous nature, flying to dust with the blow of a pick, and yields its gold by ordinary alluvial operations ; from its position and character may be easily attributed to disintegration of, and infiltration from, adjacent reefs.

Operations in the quartz will at once be resumed, and I trust, to the satisfaction of both parties. (Ambrose Johnson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 On New Nuggety Reef, Connell's Gully, first-rate stone is still being raised both in the prospecting claim and No. 2 North. The other claims, having attained the water level, operations have temporarily been sus pended, with a view of procuring machinery, when all the claims have attained tbe same depth. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 On Wombat Reef only the Cornish party is at work, employing 16 men, and, as usual, doing well. Parker's Specimen Reef, Dry Diggings, is at a standstill, pending conclusion of treaty for the erection of machinery. Beehive Reef is producing, as usual, good stone, but no crushing has taken place since my last report. In Yandoit the first excitement of the rush is gradually subsiding into a legitimate, well directed, and energetically prosecuted system of prospecting ; almost every hill within miles, where any prospect of striking a reef exists, ringing with the sound of pick and axe, and enlivened with the busy scenes of in dustry. On Pioneer Reef tbe original payable claims are still turning out .well, the quartz being raised looking as promising as ever. A number of adjoining claims, sinking for the reef, have by the influx of wati r been com pelled to suspend operations, pending the completion of the Great Reef Company's machine, the engine shaft of which company is busily being proceeded with. Quartz mining in Jim Crow proper is still in the old claims being satisfactorily pursued, good wages being the general average, but no additional discoveries of note or remark- ably good crushings have taken place during the month. In this part of my division a great many reefs exist, thafhave been pros pected and half an ounce or thereabouts per ton has been obtained, but bad roads, distance from crushing machines, and various other reasons have hitherto prevented their being effectually worked. The attention of specu lators and capitalists is now however begin ning to be directed towards this part of the division, and I trust that a few months will witness a decided improvement in quartz mining in general in this long neglected field. On Hamburg Reef Messrs. Jochum and Company as well as Ritter and Company are busy raising quartz, in both instances promising as good a yield as ever; but here. as on Pioneer Reef, several of the adjoining claims having struck water, have lately been registered. It has been proposed to amalga mate a number of the southern claims, with a view of sinking one main shaft, and a meeting of shareholders has been called for the early part of November to consider the proposition ; and I know of no case where such an arrangement would be more likely to prove more conducive to the mutual benefit of all interested.

A few parties have started tunnels from Jim Crow Creek into the table land below Shepherd's Flat, and I doubt not that such prospects will be ob tained as to cause an extensive rush. Nearly all ground worked and abandoned in most of the principal basaltic hills has again been taken 'up in extended claims, and on the whole the tunnelling portion of our miners are doing extremely well. Most of the refuse headings left at the mouths of abandoned tunnels is also taken up, and found to pay well when a sufficiency of water can be commanded. On Cosmopolitan Reef, King William's Gully, the prospectors have tried the reef with very good prospects at different levels, and are now sinking a main shaft to prospect the reef at the water level (about 100 feet deep). The average yield has hitherto been 1 and 2 oz. par ton, and I trust that a similar prospect may be obtained at the depth above mentioned. On Trogish's Reef only the prospecting party is at work, averaging 2 or 3 oz. per ton. The rest of the claims having been worked with no results for upwards of three months, are at present idle under the privilege of registration. Old Nuggety Reef has lately been taken up again, and I have been shown splendid coarse gold obtained in the very surface of a newly opened leader. In alluvial sinking I have to report a rush these last days to a- new gully near the Mount Prospect store, about one mile from Deep Creek. The prospectors, after whom the gully is designated \" Ralph's Lead,\" have bottomed a shaft at 60 feet, and discovered a gutter or lead about 15 or 20 feet wide, with 1$ or 2 feet of wash-dirt, averaging from 1 to 2 dwt. per tub. Although the prospect is not at all brilliant, still if the ground on an average proves to be no worse good wages may be made, the sinking being comparatively easy, and the water, when a number of shafts are being worked, not likely to prove any very serious obstacle. I am informed that the number of people on the ground is up wards of 200, daily increasing by fresh arrivals, and several shafts are expected to bottom in the coming week. The discovery is of too recent date to express any decided opinion, but in my next report 1 shall do myself the honor to furnish more detailed information. In the prospecting claim on New German Reef, payable stone is still being brought to the surface, and a number of fresh claims have been taken up. Besides these and other old established reefs, a number of new ones are busily being prospected, and several tolerably good prospects have been obtained ; but the Great Reef Company's machine being in course of removal, Mr. Morrison's undergoing various little improvements, and the Frauklinford Mill (water-power) not being capable of crushing any very large quantity, easily account for the small number of crushings since my last report. In puddling and sluicing, matters remain unchanged; the water supply during the montb has been amply sufficient, and the proceeds, although nothing brilliant, still satisfactory. Most of the claims at work have been occupied for a considerable time, and will in all probability, last the season out, so it is not likely that I shall have the pleasure of reporting any decided improve ment, uuless in the event of new ground being opened. In Connell's Gully and vicinity the greatest activity in sluicing is manifest, and I believe that the parties interested have no reason to be dissatisfied. Chinaman's Flat and Blind Creek are pretty well occupied by puddlers, and most of the parties have made ample provisions for storing water for the summer months, and on the whole, through out the division, the general state of these branches of industry present a very healthy appearance. The rest of our old gullies are mostly de serted, a few parties scattered here and there, earning a precarious living, but their number is daily decreasing. In New Nuggety Gully, Yandoit, the only gully where a considerable number of people is working, no heavy finds have come to my knowledge since my last report. In Forty-foot several parties are making a good living in the old ground, but most of these are only watching for a chance in quartz reefing, as the chance of making even wages in the old ground is very limited. Owing to the short space of time left me since the receipt of your circular I have not been able to complete my geological plans in time for transmission with this report, and must therefore beg the indulgence of your Honorable Board. I trust, however, to be able to comply with your instructions for November. Tunnelling is as usual progressing favor ably, although nothing of special interest has occurred.

The gold is exceedingly coarse, varying from $ oz. to 6 oz. in weight: several nuggets of from 2 oz. to $ oz. having been got during the last few weeks. (R. L. M. Kitto, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 Quartz Mining. \u2014 Liverpool Reef; I send you a plan and section of this reef, situated at the head of Sailors' Gully. By referring to the plan you will observe there are four dis tinct leaders cropping out on the surface \u2014 A, B, C, D. The leader D had a shaft sunk on it some years since, which was eventually abandoned as unproductive. Sometime since Goldsmith and Company, who hold the pro specting claim were working a shaft (a) and discovered the leader A, in which they found a specimen of gold ; they abandoned that shaft and sunk a new one at (6), where they discovered the leader B, out of which they got over 2 oz. of gold to the ton of stone. They sunk deeper (see section) and struck the leaders B2 and B3, from which they have realized 3$ oz. to the ton. They are still sinking with the expectation of coming on other leaders, which I think likely; at the same time driving on those already discovered, in which they see splendid stone. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 I examined the locality minutely, and found a shaft (d) sunk a few feet on leader (C). This leader I believe to be the main one ; it is composed of a light friable (sugary) quartz, with a beautiful fluccan (decomposed clay slate) on the hanging wall. This underlies to the west, at about an angle of 45\u00b0 from the horizon, having a splendid smooth hanging wall. On examining the old shaft (c) on leader (D), I found a large irregular body of quartz going nearly perpendicular, with droppers from the eastern side. (These drop pers can be seen from an old drive.) The past month has been a busy one in both alluvial and quartz mining : in alluvial From these indications, I am of opinion that at a depth of from 120 to 130 feet from the surface the whole of these leaders will make a junction at (E), where the fluccan will cut through the leader (D) and form itself on the western wall, and the whole become a regular well defined lode. through the floodings and consequent exer tions to nullify its effects; in quartz through the discovery of one or two new reefs, and the starting of two of our most important mining companies. The puddlers and sluicers during the be ginning of the month were greatly retarded in consequence of the continued heavy rains, I believe it is because the reefs in this locality are so split and undefined near the surface that so little notice is taken of them. Miners should not, however, be deterred from searching for them because they are not visible on the surface. In no country in the world have mineral or metalliferous veins been so easily discovered as in this, where nearly if not every reef at work has been discovered either cropping out on surface, or in working the alluvial mines. but they are again busily at work. In tunnelling the miners continue steadily and perseveringly at work, apparently con tent with their earnings. In connection with this branch of mining a new system is being inaugurated, viz., the crushing of the poorer drift, by which means that is made to yield a profit which hitherto has been deemed useless. There has been a new rush at the head of Commissioner's Gully, near the township of The disintegration of those outcropping has evidently supplied or fed our alluvial Europeans.

It would be contrary to nature to suppose that our reefs or lodes exist only where they show on surface. I believe, and very strongly, that these reefs in certain meridians exist to an almost unlimited extent (length), and it is through their non-appearance on the surface of the ground that the idea of their non existence exists. Ferron's Reef. \u2014 This has also made a start, having, I trust a splendid future. They have not as yet cleaned up their crushing, but the stuff looks well. Alliance Company. \u2014 This has been doing very little lately, merely paying their way with, as yet, no sign of profit. Vaughan Mining Companv.\u2014 This little company is still going ahead. They havo proved that stuff which will not possibly pay for toming or sluicing will yield a handsome profit by the more expensive pro cess of crushing. It is found that the fine particles of gold washed away by the water in toming and sluicing, are re tained by the quicksilver in the process of crushing. Gold in Sandstone. \u2014 While on the subject of quartz reefs, I will notice briefly the subject of gold in sandstone. In visiting various parts of the district, I have from time to time had opportunities of seeing and examining various specimens of the supposed gold-bearing sandstone, and from what I have seen there is no possible foundation for supposing that sandstone is a matrix of gold, except to the inexperienced or unpractised eye. Although I have seen all the varieties of specimens of gold-bearing sandstone, not in one of them does gold actually exist iu sandstone. Taradale Division. (Thomas Turner, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Whenever gold is seen in connection with sandstone it shows itself in seams, heads, joints, or splits, mixed with the thinnest possible seam of quartz or irony looking substance; however thin it may be, it is distinct from the sandstone, and of a sub sequent formation. In fact it appears to me, that the formation of these seams or joints in the sandstone are subject to the same laws as our better defined and larger quartz leaders. I have pleasure in reporting the opening of another reef in my district. It is situated near the Limestone Creek, about three miles from Guildford, in the parish of Yandoit ; its bearing is N. 9\u00b0 W\u201e from which I infer it is a continuation of one of the eastern Tarran gower Reefs \u2014 lost in the basaltic hills north of the Loddon and the alluvial flats to the south\u2014 is found cropping out where the pri mary rock is again laid bare to the surface. This reef has been christened Nil Desperan dum, and although no stone has been crushed gold has been seen, a prospecting claim taken up and several others marked off and being worked very briskly. The reef is about 8 feet thick, underlaying to the west at an angle of 70\u00b0 from the horizon, having a splendid foot wall, with several leaders or branches going into it on the hanging wall (always a good sign). The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Companies. \u2014 El Dorado. \u2014 This has at last commenced active operations, employing 40 men, with good prospects.

Four dwt. of gold from a tub of earth was obtained in one instance, but no extension of the auriferous deposit has yet been found. With respect to the workings in the Sur vey Paddock, it appears the miners did not find sufficient gold to encourage their con tinuance in that field, as it is nearly deserted. Twice has this field been tried and aban doned ; but should a third endeavor be made with better results it will not be very sur prising, as its position and other indications are favorable. Hitherto the miners have confined their operations to the banks of the creek, but the valley being wide, it is most probable that the water channel has not always been in the same position, and the alluvial deposits of a former period may have been richer in gold than the more recent. Many a good gully on the gold fields has been tested three times before its richness was fully developed. Campaspe River Diggings. \u2014 The discovery of gold on the Campaspe River, at a place three miles below Mr. Mitchell's station, which caused so much excitement last month, has subsided to a scene of only about fifty miners. The hard nature of the sinking has been very discouraging. The stone through which the miners have been cutting has been too porous to admit of blasting with gun powder, and therefore the operation has been both difficult and tedious. A privilege to sluice-wash some ground on the Coliban river, at a place a quarter of a mile below the junction of the Back Creek has been granted to a party of miners. With the abundance of water which that river affords, such an operation can scarcely fail to be remunerative, even in places where gold exists but in small quantities. There are five tunnels being excavated in the hill ; in two the miners have reached gold, but not in large quantities ; but as the base-rock is dipping into the hill, there is some chance that a good deposit of the pre cious metal may yet be found. The prospectors' first discovery was the best, but the spot proved of no extent. Victoria and Ashtonia Reefs. \u2014 Seven claims are being worked on these adjoining reefs, and five of them are yielding good returna to their owners.

I am informed this party are perfectly satisfied with their prospects, and are sanguine of success, as their first day's sluicing, although done in a very rude and inefficient manner, yielded them two ounces of small nuggets. The fine gold was all lost, as they were unable to save it with the rude means of washing to be had there at the time. The same person also brings reliable intelligence of the discovery of two more auriferous creeks to the north of the Pleasant Creek, and also that there are about 200 miners at work on this gold field, but no stores have as yet been established, nor are provisions obtainable by the general mass of diggers, there being none except what are brought there by parties for their own use. The machinery is as follows The discovery of another gold field lying between the Mount Baw-baw gold field and the Yarra Yarra has been reported to me; it is said to be very rich but its exact position I have not yet been able to ascertain. This much however is certain, that it is a distinct gold field from that reported by Mr. Sheppard as being on the tributaries of Starvation Creek. I have the honor to state for your informa tion, that during the month of October mining matters have been assuming a better aspect than for some time past throughout the immense extent of this division. At Anderson's Creek the great want of crushing machinery is about to be supplied by Mr. Capper, who is erecting a new crush ing machine, which, under the management of that gentleman from his great experience in quartz mining and quartz crushing, must be a boon to the miner's there ; and will no doubt induce the working of the numerous abandoned reefs about Anderson's Creek. Mr. Capper also proposes ta take an extended claim on Sailor's Reef, which has been aban doned for the last three years in consequence of water, and will therefore require efficient and extensive pumping machinery. This being a very valuable reef, I have no doubt, that when the water is kept down by pumping, many other claims in its neighborhood will be taken up and worked. In Happy Valley, on the Caledonia gold field, many parties have been very success ful. A fine nugget, which weighed 84 oz. before smelting, and 78 oz. after that opera tion had been performed, was sound in a claim in this valley; 72 oz. of small nuggets also were found in the same claim within a few feet of the large nugget. Another claim has yielded over \u00a31000 worth of gold within a period of about three months ; and there is also a claim from which two men took \u00a3200 worth of gold in two days ; in short, I be lieve that this is the richest gully that has been yet opened on the Caledonia gold field. I have no doubt that there have been many heavy finds of gold in that locality that have not been made known. These various suc cesses will, in all probability, lead to the prospecting and opening up of the very large tract of country, undoubtedly auriferous, and by no means explored, that lies between One tree Hill and the Dividing Range, towards the sources of Watson's Creek and Steele's Creek, where there are numerous small creeks and gullies that have never yet been pros pected, and many of which are as much as from 2\\ to 3 miles in length with very good indications of gold. On the Caledonia gold field there is little or no change in the state of quartz mining since my last repoit. Tunnelling is being carried on steadily by the Yow-you Hill Mining Company who have now driven to a distance of 25 feet, through a very hard grey sandstone. The working is rendered ex tremely difficult from being carried on in the underlay of the rock, and the course of the tunnel being nearly at right angles to the strike.

Holmes, Randle and Company, which has been worked with so much spirit, has been checked in the rapidity with which it has hitherto been carried on, owing to their striking an ex- Several parties are preparing to leave the Caledonia for the Mount Baw-baw gold field, owing to intelligence brought from that locality by one of a party of five men, who No. Horse-power.

Its hardness and altered texture will be accounted for from the fact of its lying against a dyke of syenitic granite. The quartz miil belonging to the last men tioned company at Salter's Rush is now com pleted, and is certainly a splendid set of quartz crushing machinery, which I believe must be most efficient both in crushing and amalgamating. Great disappointment how ever is felt by the miners at this company proposing \u00a31 7s. 6d. per ton as the price for crushing, as many of the miners say that they were led to believe that the price would not exceed 15s. per ton. The high price of crushing is still a source of great discourage- ment to the quartz miners throughout this division. The New Caledonian Creek, now all but abandoned by Europeans, is becoming the centre of the Chinese portion of the popula tion, and with the exception of a few celestials about Queenstown, they are nearly all to be found either in this creek or in Cherry Tree Gully. Several miners are now doing very well in Stony Creek, near the Kangaroo ground. This creek was first discovered by me about four years ago ; some patches of very rich ground were then worked, hut it had been abandoned until about three weeks ago for a considerable length of time.

I have the honor to forward the following report of the mining operations in this di vision during the month of November. Sago Hill. \u2014 Upon this gold field no change of importance has taken place since my last report. The few claims that have been for some time past getting gold continue to do so. But, notwithstanding the yield of gold from these claims is good, no new claims have been taken up, as the opinion seems to gain ground amongst the miners, that no well defined lead exists in that locality. I have always held a contrary opinion, and so far no evidence has been adduced to cause me to alter my views on the subject. I at tribute the non-discovery of the course of the lead to the large size of the claims and the want of capital to prospect them sufficiently. Had the claims been one-fourth of their pre sent size the labor and expense of prospecting a given space of ground would have been borne by four times the number of men, and, in all probability, the holders of each of the smaller claims would have expended as much labor as was expended by the holders of the larger claim ; and, consequently, within the space occupied by one large claim four times as much ground would have been opened up; and as the discovery of auriferous deposits (whether in the case of entirely new ground, The machinery is as follows: \u2014 a2 Europeans.

The Southern Cross Company. \u2014 This com pany is at present driving in the bed rock to the northward, and though they have not yet reached the gutter there seems to be no doubt now that the lead passes under or very near to the swamp, and the Southern Cross Com pany acting on that belief has made appli cation to the Government for permission to mine thereunder. Campbell's Gully.\u2014 The several puddling companies in this locality are engaged in puddling surface and old shallow ground, and though the earth is very poor, yet, as it is obtained in large quantities at a very small expense, they are enabled to make tolerably good wages. Ihe Tannery Company has opened a drive to the eastward, and is driving in that direc tion in search of the gutter. Golden Point Lead. \u2014 The Cosmopolitan Company has opened a great extent of ground in width, and the wash-dirt continues to yiold good dividends. Should this claim prove remunerative to the same width throughout, it will afford profitable employment to the company for several years. The Leads:\u2014 The Suburban Lead.\u2014 The Essex Company has not been doing quite so well during the past month, as inconsequence of the great quantity of water in the deep ground they are unable to extend their opera tions to the gutter, and the wash-dirt upon the reefs is comparatively poor; they anticipate, however, that in the course of a few weeks the gutter will be sufficiently drained to admit of their working it profitably. The Koh-i-nor Company is still engaged in driving the new level towards tho deeper portion of their claim. The Swamp Lead.\u2014 The Black Diamond Company. Owing to the great quantity of water with which the}' have had to contend, and the poorness of the ground, this company was barely able during the early part of the month to make wages, and now, in conse quence of the quantity of water having in creased, they have been compelled to suspend their underground work. The Band of Hope Company is still sinking the shaft, and the work is progressing veiy favorably considering the difficulties they have had to contend with. Nightingale Lead. \u2014 The Great Western Company is still at work ; it was expected that they would have worked out long since. Malakhoff Lead. \u2014 The Triumphant Com pany is working the old ground and the reefs and is doing tolerably well. The Durham Company have for some time past suspended active operations, and have been and are still engaged in remodelling the company with an increased capital. The British Company is also working the reef, but the wash-dirt is very poor. Inkermann Lead. \u2014 The Allied Armies Company are still engaged in working the old gutter, and are also prospecting the reefs in the hope of discovering a quartz reef which is supposed to exist in that locality. The Great Eastern Company has, for some time past, been involved in a law suit arising out of a disagreement between the working and sleeping shareholders ; an arrangement has, however, been made and mining opera tions will shorly recommence under new management. The Great Republic Company is in full work. They have their drives from both shafts connected, their underground works are thereby well ventilated and they are able to carry on extensive operations ; still the dividends of this company are by no means large. Milkmaid's Lead. \u2014 The Burra Burra Com pany has nearly worked out the alluvial ground in their claim, and are making pre parations for working the quartz reef which passes through it. The Hand in Hand Company are still ex tending their works to the westward under Sturt street, and in spite of the very great length of their drives and the numerous disadvantages under which they labor in consequence thereof they are making fair wages.

The average yield from the quartz con tinues to be the same as already reported by me, arid confidence in the paying qualities of the various quartz lodes remains un diminished. Several companies are now engaged in the erection of machinery, and will make a start at the beginning of the new year, when I expect to be able to report an increase in the returns of gold from quartz mining. No. 3 Division. (Thomas Cowan, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows In alluvial mining there is no change since my last report. Plans and sections. \u2014 No. 1. \u2014 The ground plan shows the general arrangements of the Old Canadian Company's works; the tram ways for conveying the quartz to the battery, the dams and sand-pits into which the tail ings are conveyed by means of shoots, whence they are shovelled out after the water has been drained into the dam. The quartz lode was first struck on the crown of the hill, but as it was sound to be dipping to the east a shaft was sunk, as shown upon the plan. The company have, however, made an open cutting from which the quartz is at present being taken, and in which a large number of leaders and small veins have been found mixed with the clay slate. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The whole of these are taken, both quartz and slate, and are crushed, the yield being between 6 dwt. and 7 dwt. to the ton. The method of carrying away the tailings, &c., will be seen by reference to the plan, there being an underground drain to carry water from the main dam to the pumping shaft after it has filtered in the dam so marked. Plan No. II. is a plan of the battery engine, boiler, aDd amalgamating apparatus. The engine is of 40 horse-power, and the stamps weigh about 6 cwt. each, including the iron shafts. It will be seen that the company have now in use two methods of saving the gold \u2014 namely, by means of shaking tables and a series of ripples. The two methods have been worked against each other in order to test the relative merits of the two methods. The result of the experiment now made has been in favor of the shaking tables combined with a short series of ripples, and I believe that the company is about to adopt the shak ing tables for both divisions of their battery.

No. 4 Division, Ballaarat. (Michael O'Malley, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Section No. 1 is a longitudinal section of the whole of the workings, showing the man ner in which the quartz is taken from the open-cast and conveyed to the engine by means of the trucks drawn up the incline by a rope winding round a drum. The shoots enter the filter dam and convey the water into the main dam, whence it is conveyed to the pumping shaft by means of an under ground pipe, and thence raised to supply the battery. The machinary is as follows : \u2014 The tailings are taken out from each sand pit alternately and conveyed by means of trucks to the end of the dam, where they are deposited, thus being cleared away and the size of the dam being increased at the same time. By this means the company will be able, after a few months' work, to store up a far larger quantity of water than at present without going to any additional expense. The dotted line is on a level with the top of the platform, thus showing the degree of inclination of the tramroad, and the line A B is on a level with the top of the hill, on which the shaft has been sunk. Section No. 2 is a section through the stamping battery, showing the cam for lifting the stamps, and the wheel for raising the stamps when the stamping-boxes are to be cleaned out, as well as the self-feeding appara tus of the shoots and the shaking tables. No. 25 is a spring by which the aperture for admit ting the quartz in the shoot is kept closed until such time as the stamping-boxes become nearly empty, when the iron bar (26) striking the spring, falls back and leaves an aperture for the admission of the quartz. These bars are attached to one of each series of four stamps, and the battery is thus made self feeding. No. 21 is a wheel over which a rope passes for the purpose of keeping the stamps elevated whilst the stamping-boxes are cleared out. The former method of fixing the rollers was upon upright beams, as shown on the front elevation, but it has been found more convenient to hang them from the roof, as shown in section No. 3. Approximate value of all mining plant in the division \u00a341,500. I have the honor to forward with this report a plan of some old workings in tbe vicinity of Paddy's Gully, Rokewood. The gully named was opened some three years since, and found highly auriferous \u2014 so much so that one small party obtained, I believe, about \u00a3900 per man from their claim, after nine or ten weeks' work, and several other parties also obtained very handsome returns ranging from \u00a3150 up to \u00a3500 or \u00a3600. The gully has been from time to time since re-worked in spots here and there by various parties, but 1 believe with only moderate success; it is however presently occupied by a party who has a puddling machine very conveniently erected at its foot or embouchure with Mount Misery Creek, and who are ex cavating the stuff (principally stiff clay with a slight admixture of gravel) to the bed rock a depth of 10 or 12 feet, and passing all through the machine, which as one of the Section No. 3 is a cross section through one group of stamps, both from the front and from behind. It also shows the small engine which is used for hauling up the trucks from the open-cast, and which is supplied with steam from the same boiler as the engine used for moving the stamps. Section No. 4 is a front elevation of %the whole of the battery, cuttings, and shaft. Europeans. ' Chinese.

There are five or six other parties engaged in the immediate neighborhood ; some fos- sicking in the old ground southwards in the direction of McMillan's (now Cullen's) fence, and as the phrase goes only \" knocking out tucker,\" while others are prospecting for a quartz reef that is supposed to intersect the gully about four or five hundred feet up from its junction with the creek above mentioned. This latter party are down about 60 feet with their shaft and in hopeful expectation of discovering a good paying reef, in which I trust they will not be disappointed; at all events it is the opinion of old experienced quartz miners that the place is promising, and judging from the general features of the district as well as from the appearance of tbe large well-polished quartz boulders (some being 6 or 8 tons in weight) that abound in the immediate vicinity within a foot or two of the surface, I am disposed to think favorably of the locality. There had been a short-lived rush to a place known as Butcher's Hill, about a mile N.W., of Paddy's Gully, in the month of October, but I am sorry to say the place was quite patchy, so much so that the majority of the claims then taken up have been since aban- doned as \" rank duffer3 ;\" a few parties however are still doing tolerably well here and also at another place about two miles to the northward close to Moonlight Creek. Another small rush took place in October at Yorkey's Hill, between Long Gully No. 3 and Pinchgut Gully _{ vide District Plan), where some three or four parties continue to do very well; the sinking is shallow and chiefly through hard conglomerate or cement ; one party has just completed a tunnel from the steep declivity at the Pinchgut side into their claim and obtained very satisfactory prospects, they have also constructed a tramway from the mouth of the tunnel down to the gully and are in expectation of having a long and profitable job before them. A third rush oc- curred about the end of October or beginning of November on the south side of the Ballaa- rat and Smythesdale road at a point upwards of a mile (Smythesdale side) from the inter- section of said road with the road from Bur- rnmbeet to Buninyong, where a Government party had been prospecting; there were some 8 or 10 block claims taken up some of which have been since proved to be off the \" run\" of the deep ground, however those that happened to get the lead within their claims appear quite satisfied with the prospects obtained (general ly from 1 J to 2 dwt. per tub and about 18 inches or 2 feet of wash-dirt. The claim of McLish and Company, the Government party above- named is most to the dip and abuts on pri- vate property otherwise many more claims would have been occupied, and probably a good paying lead ere now in possession of the miners which at present would be a great desideratum, as auriferous ground easily sunk through or bottomed such as the land in question has been of late years very rarely met with in the district, a further proof if indeed any were required of the urgent necessity of a speedy settlement of the mining on private property question. The sinking commenced up towards the ranges at a depth of 15 feet and has attained to a depth of nearly 60 feet without rock, in the claim next above that of McLish and Company ; this latter company have however got the rock (basalt) and con- siderable quantity of water in their shaft which is now down I believe close on 50 feet and ex- pected to go some 20 more feet before bottom- ing, and iu anticipation of the good prospects expected to be found by them, I understand a party is in treaty with the owner of the adjoining private property for permission to mine thereon, but as yet I believe negotiations are not finally concluded. Whim Holes. \u2014 This place presently presents adull aspect, the claim of the Progressive Com- pany has been abandoned or unoccupied during the last six or eight weeks in consequence of the dissolution of the company ; however the engine and plant are still on the ground and before removing them I believe some of the old company purpose taking up the claim anew and giving it a further trial, as it appears to be the opinion of many that the ground had not been properly tested by the old com- pany, and that it is still well deserving of a thorough good prospecting, an opinion with which I perfectly agree. There is nothing of much interest to be reported of the old ground companies up the gully between here and the Little Hard Hills, most of them I under- stand are merely obtaining a living by sur- facing or by re working the old gullies in the neighborhood. There have been how- ever two new surfacing claims taken up of late on the Hard Hills (proper), and but for the scarcity or want of water it appears they would pay very good wages, the parties take about 10 or 12 inches of the surface and puddle it in tubs at the most convenient spot where a little water can be secured, and by this means are able to make from \u00a32 to \u00a32 10s. per man per week, from which it is presumable, with a good supply of water and a small engine to puddle the stuff so easily procured, the above dividends might be increased pro bably tenfold. A new company has been lately formed here also for the purpose of testing the auriferous nature of the cement that exists so abundantly nearly all over the hill, it is generally found at a depth of 12 or"], [502, "MINING SUBVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 NOVEMBER. 308 15 feet overlaying the auriferous drift and in some cases it is three or sour feet in thickness and generally has been found to contain more or less gold, but whether or not in quantity sufficient to afford remunerative returns will be soon proved as the company referred to are engaged in the erection of crushing plant with tbe view of giving it a fair trial, and once for all setting at rest the many conflict ing opiirions expressed regarding the matter. Deep Leads.\u2014 The deep leads in the divi sion, with one favorable exception, are nearly in the same condition as already oftentimes reported\u2014 namely, producing little or no gold. The exception alluded to is on Frenchman's Lead, where the united claims of the C. D. and C. ard Red Jacket Companies are yielding excellent dividends; the average returns ob tained from these claims during the last two months being something between 800 and 900 oz. weekly ; a fact that augurs well for the other (three) companies ahead on the lead, two of which (Nelson and Working Miners) are down with their shafts about 330 or 340 feet; the former has got through the fourth rock, the latter is still blasting away therein, and though it is reported to be almost im penetrable to the drill, still it appears powder tells well on it, as the company, of late, have been making tolerable progress in their des cent to the \"regions\" of the gutter, lying, as is estimated, some 420 feet beneath the surface. Cobbler's. \u2014 This lead is presently iu the occupation of two companies, one of which (Camp Company), some two or three weeks since, got into the gutter and obtained rather pronrising prospects, but as yet they are em ployed at mere preliminary arrangements and havo not therefore thoroughly tested the quality of the stuff; the other company (Prince of Wales) have been meeting with rather better success of late, and are now sanguine that their claim will ultimately pay ; they have re cently got a few small nuggets, and moreover there appears to be an improvement in the general yield of the wash-dirt, so that although the stuff is still poor the company are hopeful of better things. Crawfish and Black Leads. \u2014 There is nothing calling for particular mention to be reported of the Alston and Weardale Com pany, Crawfish Lead, nor of the Scottish and Cornish Company, Black Lead, the former being still sinking and the latter obtaining only poor dividends, in consequence, it is said, of the great water difficulties experienced in working the deep ground, and the inadequate power of the machinery. Staffordshire Reef. \u2014 The Comet or Pro specting Company on this reef have been this time back doing very well, their weekly dividends amounting to something between \u00a315 and \u00a320 per man; moreover they have recently increased the nurnberof theirstampers from six to ten. so that as soon as the latter number is in full work they expect, even with a considerable falling off in the yield of their stone, to keep the dividends up to about the above figure. A second company (Porter and Company) on this reef has been this time back idle in consequence of a breakage happening to their machinery. However, I believe the necessary repairs are now effected and work will be at once resumed. The three or four remaining companies on this reef have not been obtaining very brilliant returns lately, still the reef is held in very good repute by those who know it best and longest, so much so that a fourth engine is being erected on its northern end by the Oriental Company, who have, sometime since, applied for a lease of their claim. Also to the southward of this reef, in the neighborhood of Kangaroo Gully, two prospecting claims have been recently occupied, but as yet no reef discovered ; the parties are, however, down some 55 or 60 feet and intend soon to put in drives or levels in search of one ; and, as encouraging prospects had been obtained in both instances from the outcrop, before the claims were taken up, the parties are rather sanguine with regard to ultimate success, and if successful in discover ing a paying reef, very likely it will, in time, be sound to form an intermediate link between the Staffordshire and Penrose Beefs. Penrose Reef. \u2014 The prospecting party on this reef are still making fair wages by band crushing and washing the debris. They sunk to a depth of 90 feet some time back, and put in a level to cut the reef, but could not suc ceed in finding it at that depth, and in conse quence returned to the upper level (30 feet deep), where they had been for some twelve months previously getting very good stone, and where they have since been meeting with about their usual success. The Great Eastern Company, south of the prospectors, have got their engine and plant into position some two months since ; and I am sorry to say, the result of their first crushing has not been very encouraging, though the trial crushing made at Porter and Company's mill, Stafford shire Reef, a few months previously, yielded 14 dwt. per ton, and, as a matter of course, at once induced the company to set about tbe procuring of their own machiuery. Now, however, the result of their late crushing scarcely averages 2 dwt. per ton, a falling off, no doubt, attributable to some gross defect in the amalgamation, which it is to be hoped will be soon rectified. Pinchgut or Humboldt Reef. \u2014 The Austra lian (formerly Germanic Confederation) Com pany's claim on this reef has been latterly yielding, in the words of the manager, \" satis factory\" returns.

Their prospects, I am informed, are very promising; but not having got into the gutter, in consequence of having to cut cham bers and other necessary work, have not yet puddled any dirt. The other companies on this lead are still at work without any impor tant change. On Kitty's Lead the Union Company, after about three years' unsuccessful work in pros pecting for the junction of the Scotchman's with Kitty's Lead, has abandoned the ground ; but some few of the original company have been prospecting a reef intercepted in driving for the junction, and from trial crushings have realized a yield of about 15 dwt. per ton, which has led to the registration of the claims shown on the accompanying plan. Quartz mining is still being carried on with spirit by some of the companies on the different reefs. Frenchman's Gully Reef. \u2014 The prospectors on this reef are about getting 20 tons of stone crushed on trial, at the Australian Company's mill, Pinchgut ; and should the result be satis factory, as it is confidently expected to be, they will lose no time in procuring machinery of their own. So upon the whole, I think I may say, matters have been of late gradually assuming an upward tendency generally through the division. \u25a0The cost of crushing continues \u00a31 per ton. No. 5 Division. (J. W. R. Pringle, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Imperial Company, Hiscock's Reef, has crushed during the month 600 tons of quartz, from which the yield has been about 200 ounces. This company has commenced sinking a new shaft 7 ft. X 4 ft. east of their present workings, with a view of cutting the lode at about water level. The One and All Company have nearly com pleted their battery of sixteen heads, which promises to be very effective. This company deserve credit for the manner in which they are carrying out their work, for they seem to spare no expense in securing good machinery. The Standard Company on this reef will also commence crushing in a few days, with flattering prospects, having been for some time past raising some good stone. On the All Nations Reef the All Nations Company has crushed during the month about 240 tons, at an average yield of about 8 dwt. The Jenny Lind and Britannia Extended Companies, on the Scandinavian Reef, are busily engaged in erecting crushing plant on their claims. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 No. 6 Division.

At the northern extremity of my district, skirting the south end of Mr. Darlot's station, there is an alluvial flat of considerable extent, into which it has been well ascertained some leads of gold are trending. Several unavailing attempts to work this ground have been made but failure has attended them up to tbe present time, in consequence of the difficulty of re ducing the drift waters there, so as to render the ground workable ; two successive parties, assisted by steam power, have been obliged to leave off, after months of incessant baling. The depth of sinking does not much exceed 50 feet. The foregoing facts will give an idea of the quantity of water, when two steam engines successively employed for nearly eighteen months were unable to effect any appreciable diminution in its volume. One other party remains still on the ground, but judging from their modus operandi their fate is likely to be the same as that of their predecessors. Although I have scarcely anything to report as essentially new, or materially departing from the customary routine of operations, the mining interest is nevertheless making a silent and steady progress in every subdivision of this district. The Lexington Quartz Mining Company have struck a lode in which they have re ported to have seen gold, but in very small quantity. Very many reefs of this kind have been found to traverse the valley of Smythe's and the bordering ranges; as yet however very little has been done in prosecuting work on them, whether from their poverty, the inability of those engaged in prospecting for them to turn 4 or 5 dwt per ton to a paying account, or the more seductive attractions of the alluvial leads, I can scarcely say, but I am apprehensive that no vigorous determination in favor of quartz mining will set in here until the alluvial ground ceases to exercise its attractive influence. It is true that there are fewer fresh dis coveries now than at former periods, but then the rapidity with which those discoveries suc ceeded each other and the wild and chimerical speculations which they led to, in various instances, before their character could be established, proved in the main as great a source of loss to the community as of gain to a few individuals; but now that the days of those ephemeral rushes are nearly over, mining companies of stability and enterprise are succeeding to the ground where the tub and cradle had been heretofore fruitlessly plied, and the result of their successful operations are more encouraging auguries of the future prosperity of the miners than anything which the past unsystematic regime could ensure, even though having the advantage of new and unworked ground to sustain it. The shallow alluvial patches and surfacing grounds are now almost entirely in the possession of the Chinese, and a small proportion of the Europeans who are incapable of engaging in more expensive and laborious operations. The Rob Roy Company, Warren's Flat, have been for the last fortnight working better ground than any which they have had during the last two years. It is believed to be a new run proceeding from Watson's Gully. The Perseverance, Britannia, and Beaumont Companies are in good luck ; the latter com pany have a first rate claim. The Surprise and Old Pioneer Companies have sunk new shafts for the purpose of working the remote end of their respective claims, inaccessible on account of distance from their old shafts. The Young Pioneer and Sir Henry Barkly Companies are realizing fair wages on the ground deserted by its former occupants. The great number of steam engines em ployed in the district, as appears from the subjoined table, is in itself evidence of the magnitude of the mining interest here; and when it is considered that this large steam power is employed on known alluvial leads which promise to be of several years' duration, and that many other leads of the same description remain still undiscovered, what a hopeful prospect is here unfolded, irrespective altogether of that still more permanent source of wealth, our quartz reefs, in the development The Reliance Company at the south end of Smythesdale, have reached the gutter of the trunk lead formed by the united leads of Smythesdale and Brown's.

The Havelock and Prince of Wales Companies are in receipt of excellent returns. The Magna Charta Com pany some time ago struck wash-dirt, which they believed to be on the reef; they con tinued the drive until trap rock appeared in the face of it. They then commenced driving at a lower level of about 13 feet, and have recently reached gravel, which they believe to be the top of the auriferous drift. The drift of the higher level will pay for working it. The Brown's and Smythe's Junction Com pany, in Allotment 3, Scarsdale, have reached black clay iu their shaft and are fitting up a very good engine. I opine this company will get the Trunk Lead and Hong Kong Lead, which will then proceed through Allotment No. 4, where the Bute Company are con ducting operations. The Cr\u0153sus Company on the lead of that name near the Black Hill, Scarsdale, also the Lord John Russell and Lord Palmerston, are making good wages. The Kossuth, Prince of Wales, Emu, and All Nations Companies, Black Ball Lead, have excellent claims. The Waterloo Claim is below mediocrity. The Golden Gate Company, on Allotment No. 2, have struck into the gutter and have got fair returns. The new sluicing company, on the Black Hill, have their works in a very forward state ; the machinery is select and the business seems to be conducted with economy and efficiency. The Homeward Bound Company, at the southern base of the Black Hill, after repeated misadventures for the last nine months, are at length in a fair way of testing the deep ground on which their shaft stands : they have every en couragement to proceed, as the claims higher up the gully are getting large quantities of gold. The boiler of the Morning Light Lead ex ploded last week, frightfully shattering the greater portion of their erections ; as this claim had been always poor, it is feared that this disaster will lead to the abandonment of the claim. The Captain Hern Quartz Prospecting Company, east of Clark's station, have got stone which turned out 4 dwt. to the ton. They have reason to expect better. The Cleft of the Rock Company, Spring Dallah, have reached the gutter, and got fair prospects. I have not yet visited the claim, so I am unable to give further particulars, but shall avail myself of the first opportunity to examine into the relations of a claim which will unravel the mystery which has long shrouded the course of the United Linton Leads, and give a fresh impetus to mining in that quarter. The Fitzroy Company, the lowest in this gully, have sunk one shaft, and are beginning another; a sharp turn in the course of this lead is proved by the shallowness of the trial shaft just bottomed. This and the Oldham Lead contiguous, are likely to join and form a tributary to the main trunk lead about the south boundary of Allotment 9, Scarsdale, where two leases of 50 acres each, namely the Scarsdale and Gemini have been applied for, and on which boring has been commenced. The Tunnel Company, i.e. the Try Again, Devil's Kitchen, after pushing on their exca vations over 900 feet, have encountered trap rock abreast of the drive. What will be their future course of action I am not informed; but most likely they will construct a capacious chamber at the point at which they met the trap, or convenient thereto, and sink a per pendicular shaft from that to the level of the gutter, which the depth of the Cleft of the Rock shaft will now enable them to approxi mate to. The deep alluvial leads at Browne's are nearly worked out. Only the United Browne's, Grand Junction, and Hand-in-Hand lease holds are the claims of any importance there. Some of the surfacing claims are paying tolerably. The quartz reefs are paying better than in any other part of the district. The Endurance Company, Sailors' Reef, crushed half an ounce to the ton. British Workman Company, on Victoria Reef, obtained 100 oz. for a fortnight, which is about half an ounce to the ton. The Victoria Company about the same; from repeated experiments half an ounce per ton may be regarded as the average value of these reefs. About 60 feet above the level of this tunnel there is a flat reef, which will pay about half an ounce to the load. This fact is ascertained from the Italian's tunnel adjoining. We have therefore within the same surface area two distinct deposits of auriferous earth separated from one another by about a hundred feet of basalt, and the superior deposit overlaid by about eighty feet of the same rock which reaches the surface. A new lode at Budgeon's Reef, has been struck by Griffiths and Company, which promises to be the richest struck yet in that locality ; several batteries are in course of erection. The North American Company, Happy Valley, have met with a series of mishaps up to the present ; their machinery is either inadequate to the work to be performed, or else has been unskilfully managed; at all The deep end of Monkey Gully Lead is"], [506, "MINING SUEVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 NOVEMBER. 312 pitch of the gutter, it then follows that the Pioneer Company bottomed 26 feet too shallow, and this should be the additional depth to which they should continue their shaft. events vexatious delays and expense has been entailed on the company, which a little sore thought might have averted. I may here observe, that the ruin of many companies has been brought about after this manner : when they take up ground for mining purposes no pains are taken to ascertain the peculiar nature of that ground, nor the diffi culties attending mining upon it, what descrip tion of machinery will be required, nor whe ther the persons to whom are entrusted the management and direction of affairs are com petent for such duties ; instead of a compre hensive and reliable estimate and specification to begin with, the work is hurriedly begun and ignorautly conducted ; and it is only when a vast expenditure of time and money is fruitlessly wasted that the unpleasant fact of the initial blundering manifests itself, and too frequently in a manner that shows no alter native but to begin operations de novo with the experience derived from such disheartening trials. The Black Lead, Lintons, is altogether in the occupation of the John Bull, Redan, and Glamorgan Companies, who are, by economy of labor and diligent application, enabled to derive from \u00a33 to \u00a35 per man weekly from it. The shallow gullies to the south-east of tho old township, viz., Cousins and California Gullies, continue to give fair dividends; the entire absence of water in the drift, and tho shallow and inexpensive nature of the work ings not requiring any deductions from the gross yield, which is a considerable item where expensive and complicated machinery is indispensable. Nothing definite as regards the character of the quartz reef in this locality has been yet determined ; there are eight prospecting parties now sinking for quartz, and some of the shafts are very deep. The Slaughteryard Hill, Lucky Woman's, often alluded to by me in previous reports, continues still good. At Carngham, the mines are in a very prosperous state. The Prince of Wales, at the top of Snake A7alley, have just finished their claim, taken up about twenty months ago, and they have cleared, after defraying all incidental expenses, nearly \u00a35 per man per week from the beginning. The Ivanhoe Company are the latest that bottomed, and it looks very well. The Cri terion, Hibernia, Menai Straits, and Tam O'Shanter are all quite satisfied with their hick ; indeed, some of these claims are paying admirably. The Standard Lead, Linton's, maintains its proud pre-eminence over all others in the district. The Great Britain, adjoining, got last week \u00a313 per man. The Sherwood, next claim, are equally favored. The Pembroke Company had last week about \u00a350 per man. The North Star, over \u00a320 per man. The Flying Buck will have over \u00a31000 per man, when their claim will be worked out. The course of the Standard Gutter beyond the shaft of the Edinburgh Company has been for a long time a subject of curious speculation. The depth to which the Atlas Company have attained now has all but decided the point ; there can be little doubt but that the lead will pass through the shaft, or in close contiguity to it. This shaft is situate about six chains west of Linton Park, western fence, and is admirably situated also for the Royal Standard and Flagstaff Leads. The Magnum Bonum had been laboring under some disadvantage arising from pecu niary liabilities which they are now disen gaged from, aud the quality of their stuff is such as to give \u00a34 or \u00a35 a week. The United Miners have lately bottomed on wash-dirt capable of realizing 6 oz. to the machine, and in great quantities. The General Picton have opened a drive at 173 feet from the surface. The Carngorurn are erecting the largest machinery in that district ; this is the party who are sinking at the soot of the Green Hill, and who were compelled to desist on a former occasion on account of the inefficiency of their engine. The Pioneer shaft in Linton Park has been bottomed at about 100 feet ; the difference of level between this shaft and that of the Edin burgh is 26 feet, and their distance asunder about 2000 feet. If the depth of the gutter in the latter be 90 feet, the depth of the former, without allowing for the pitch of the gutter for such a distance, would be 116 feet; if to this be added 10 feet as the estimated On the quartz reef, the Britannia claim is turning out 16 dwt. to the ton. The North Grenville have not been able to penetrate below the line of water level. Johnson's Company and the Reign of Science are erect-"], [507, "MINING SUBVEYOES' REPORTS \u2014 NOVEMBER. 313 ing stamping batteries, and the Chester Castle Company sinking a prospecting shaft. On (the private property) Preston's Hill there are several magnificent claims ; tbe Victoria and Saxon being amongst the most deservedly celebrated. Since my last report the party prospecting near the old Bullarook diggings bottomed, and obtained a prospect of 2 dwt. to the tub. Their shaft is 80 feet in depth, but they, as well as all the other parties who have taken up claims (eight in number), have com menced to open tunnels for the purpose of more easily and inexpensively working the ground, which is very well situated for such a mode of working. On the 10th ultimo, whilst descending the prospectors' shaft for the purpose of making a survey and examina tion of their workings, the rope broke, and I was precipitated a distance of about 25 feet to the bottom. In consequence of this acci dent I have been since confined, and will not be able to resume my out-door duties for at least ten days more. [Tliis report arrived too late for publication last month.] Ceeswick Division. (James Stevenson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 The Bald Hills Lead still continues to pay remarkably well. All the claims now bot tomed are getting more or less gold. One party (the Sons of Justice Company) divided during the month 260 oz., or 6^ oz. per man per week. Three new claims have been laid off to the south-west of this party during the month. The Havilah lead is, I regret to say, en tirely abandoned for the present. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 At Graham's Hill two additional parties have bottomed, and are getting gold. All the claims on this hill are paying good wages. The Ironstone Hill at Slaty Creek, which was opened and abandoned seven months since, is again taken up, and some payable ground sound. It is, however, very patchy ; the miners who are getting gold sometimes work for days without getting any, and at times get a very rich patch. The sinking, which is very hard and through rock, varies from 16 to 30 feet. Those parties who are engaged at the cement are making fair and constant wages. The Hard Hill Crushing Company have crushed for various parties during the month 73 tons, having a yield of 53 oz. 1 dwt. 20 gr., or an average of a little more than 14 dwt. 13 gr. to the ton. The same company have crushed for themselves, from the 1st to the 30th November, 470 tons of tailingsand cement refuse, with a return of 70 oz. 12 dwt., being an average of 3 dwt. -rj gr. nearly per ton. The Enterprise Company have crushed for this month 400 tons, yielding 79 oz,, or an average of 3 dwt. 22J gr. per ton. The Little Wonder Company have crushed 198 tons, yielding 36 oz. 1 dwt. 21 gr., or an average, nearly, of 3 dwt. 16 gr. per ton.

The reserved quantity of quartz now in sight is estimated at 48,000 tons. The late work ings have been carried on at the southern end of the mine, where the quartz is not so rich as more northward. It is contemplated to procure a powerful winding engine in order that the mine may be worked at a greater depth. The stone being raised from the Wel come Reef has not been separately tested, but it looks well. The Prince of Wales Company on the same reef have temporarily suspended work. There has been a quartz reef opened this month in Opossum Gully, a branch of Cob bler's Gully, from which several very rich specimens have been taken, and about which the shareholders are very sanguine, the depth of sinking is as yet only 20 feet and it is im possible yet to ascertain whether it is a main reef or only a leader. Yankee Company. \u2014 The average quantity of quartz reduced by this company's battery (eight heads) is 120 tons weekly, yield nearly 1J oz. per ton. They are about to erect a 35 horse-power engine to raise the stone in place of the two whims at present used, and work the mine wholly from the new main shaft. The present depth (230 feet) is con sidered tbe maximum depth at which a horse whim can be worked. With the aid of better machinery the company intend to go down another 70 feet, and open out cross drives for the Welcome and Westernly Lodes. I enclose a plan of their workings on the easternmost reefs. As observed in my report for September last, the Victoria Company struck the continuation of a band of quartz from this company's ground, having a devi ation 25\u00b0 east of north;; afterward 49\u00b0 east of north, resuming a course of 15\u00b0 eastward from the usual bearings. It was anticipated that a junction of this spur would be dis covered in the Yankee claim. In explanation of the plan I forward, I may say, that this lode (which has no special signification) starts abruptly on its course 3 feet from the eastern reef; this separation consists of the usual yellow slate reef. At this point the new lode is 8 feet wide, having a square end, which appears perpendicularly alike, as the company have stoped out this lode 30 feet upwards, with no apparent alteration in its appearance. Clunes Mining. \u2014 In reference to mining operations in this portion of my district for the past month, I have little else to do than make a progressive report of the heretofore workings : \u2014 Port Phillip Company. \u2014 Tbe quantity of quartz crushed is as follows : \u2014 Yield. tons. oz. dwt. gr.

Clunes Company. \u2014 The late half-yearly re turns of this company show that they have raised from the 5th May to 3rd November last, 14,073 tons of quartz, which yielded Victoria Company have been crushing 120 tons per week. Their yield from mixed"], [509, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 NOVEMBER. 315 quartz, namely, the continuation of the eastern reef (here very poor) and the new eastern lode, averaged 10 to 12 dwt. per ton. They have obtained stone yielding nearly 3 oz. per ton, and are sinking their shaft (10x4) 70 feet deeper to mine for it, during which time, owing to necessary alterations in the pumping gear, the works below other wise are stayed. The plunger will be 285 feet from the surface, and the drawing-lift 140 feet. This arrangement will avoid the necessity of future alteration of pipes in the event of deeper mining. John Bull Company and Southern Lights Company are continuing as usual, making from \u00a33 to \u00a34 per week. On North Clunes, the All Nations Com pany have opened up drives and are getting paid. Here also the Sons of Justice Com pany have taken up an extended claim, and are putting down a shaft. No fresh ground has been broken in this district for mining purposes, the depth and character of the sinking appears to deter parties from prospecting.

They daily look for ward to strike the RobinsOD Lode. They are not much troubled with water, and the pump ing gear attached to the winding engine works satisfactorily. The lower shaft is being sunk to the level of the new main drives, for lowering timber, to fill up worked out ground, and for air in the meantime. Many improvements in their system of working have been effected ; they now lower their skips or buckets by a break attached to tbe engine, which enconomises steam and time.

There are several leaders from two inches to eight inches thick on the eastern side, some of which join the reef at this depth. The reef is ten feet thick. They are saving the entire body of quartz, but have not had any crushed yet. They are also sinking a main shaft, 6 feet by 3} feet, which they intend sinking to a depth of 100 feet before commencing to mine from it. The shaft is on the eastern side of the reef, and will strike the eastern dip at the above depth. They are now down 56 feet, and are driving to the reef for the purpose of examining its thickness and quality. By my next report I Alliance Company are down 150 feet, with their new main shaft ; they will sink it 280 feet; are at present below the water level ; but not having struck a quartz reef yet, the shaft is comparatively dry. An engine is about to be erected to supplement the whim. No steps have been taken to work the quartz claims which I surveyed last month on the Southern Hill.

Mount Trench. \u2014 Since the lease on this reef was cancelled, a party have taken up a portion of it under their miner's right. They are now repairing a shaft, from which they intend testing the reef at a depth of 50 feet. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Kangaroo Company are completing their 200 feet shaft on Hick's Reef. All other mining operations on Gordon are for the present suspended. Mount Egerton. \u2014 Rose Company, Little Hill Reef, will have their machinery ready for work this week. They have a large quantity of quartz and quartz tailings (old, crushed three years ago), which will occupy them for some months ; at present they are not doing anything in the mines. There has been a good deal of stir lately created amongst the miners by a declaration of the finding of new auriferous ground in the discovery of a new reef about eight miles from this place, on the west side of the Ballan road. Big Hill Reef. \u2014 The Egerton Companj', on the north end of this reef, are working at a depth of 45 feet ; the reef is 45 feet thick, all of which they are crushing. The machinery being the property of the company they find that any quartz yielding above 3 dwt. per ton will pay them, while the other claims on the reef who have to pay foi crushing cannot take more than an average of eight sect of the reef. I have visited the spot and have measured out several claims, and I hold applications for several more. The deepest sinking at present does not exceed twenty feet, aud the quartz raised is certainly of a promising character, and appears likely to produce well. I have seen some good specimens, and I could discover but few lumps when I was there in which a speck of gold was not visible. There have been a good many fresh arrivals of miners from other diggings since this dis covery has taken place, and claims are being taken up. There has not yet been any of the quartz crushed, so that I cannot report upon the actual yield of gold. All Nations Gully (alluvial). \u2014 Two claims are working in the old ground, As they have horse whims and puddling machines, they can raise and put through a large quantity of stuff. They average \u00a34 per week per man ; tbe sinking is from 20 to 40 feet. The prospect claim in this gully came on a false bottom of pipe clay and clay slate lying horizontally, on which they found a little gold : this stratum is 6 feet thick, they are now 70 feet deep, and will probably bottom at 100 feet. Simmon's Reef. \u2014 The Imperial Company have not been very successful during the past month, but they are making a new winning from which they expect better results. Werribee River. \u2014 On the north of this river there are three parties working (alluvial), the depth of sinking from 4 feet to 14 feet, but the gold is so distributed that it will only pay sluicing, or puddling a large quantity with machinery. There are indications of quartz reefs in the locality, but none struck on as yet. Appleton Brothers. \u2014 The adjoining claim to this have not been going on with their usual speed from a similar cause \u2014 that of effecting a modified or new opening of the reef.

This is a great advantage, and, if a similar and powerful machinery was introduced generally on the Blackwood diggings, I am induced to think that they would not be far behind the first in the colony in amount of produce, there being such abundance of not very rich, but certainly payable quartz reefs existing here, presenting a wide field for enterprise. Alluvial Mining. \u2014 This class of mining has been going on steadily. There is as yet but little complaints of want of water, which seems to keep up this year to a later period than usual. There is ample watershed at Blackwood to supply the diggers all the year round, if it was properly collected, with means provided for its distribution where required. BEEOHWORTH MINING DISTRICT. It is the rule in Blackwood to crush all the quartz raised ; there is no selection made but all is brought to the mill promiscuously and indiscriminately, and so crushed.

Sluicing being the chief means by which gold is obtained, keeps the miners steadily employed ; many, however, say one or two out of each claim have gone to the Wahgunyah rush, to take and hold claims, with the chance of their turning out well, leaving their partners to carry on the sluicing operations and retain the water rights. not remember ever to have had a more favorable season: tbe only drawback is the damage caused by the floods.

It i3 a fact worthy of notice that, although most of the ground in both these divisions has been already worked, \u2014 and re -worked, in some instances, as many as six (6) times over \u2014 yet, with a large supply of water, and the im proved methods of working now in use, it pays as high as \u00a37 to \u00a38 per week to the hand on re-working it ; \u2014 of course not so much in all cases, yet almost invariably gives fair wages. There are various expensive tail or sluicing races through the district, which are being extended or deepened from time to time, as well as new ones being formed ; their cost being generally from \u00a3200 to \u00a3800 each. The El Dorado diggings are improving. Messrs. Kenyon and Co. have at last struck a rich lead, as well as the adjoining claim of McEvory's party. At Bowman's Forest claims on the German Lead are turning out well, an ounce to the cart load, 3 feet of wash dirt, and 70 feet sinking. At the Perseverence Lead they are very quiet. On these leads there is, and has been a great deal too much shepherding, which ought to be put a stop to as much as possible. The owners of the tail race between Rowdy and Osborne's Flat, Yackandandah Division, have had one wash up since the completion of their undertaking, and seem well pleased with their prospects. They got \u00a3800 worth of gold from a very small portion of their claim, (which extends 500 yards along the bed of the creek from bank to bank), paying them over \u00a32 per day to the hand, and wages being but 10s. per day, leaves a handsome return to the proprietors. Another large tail race has been completed during the mouth, that of Messrs. Dillon and Company, in Europa Gully, Nine-mile Division. It has taken the proprietors nearly two years to complete the undertaking, and from the well known rich character of the ground is almost sure amply to repay them for tlieir perse verance. They hold over ten acres of a claim, an extent of ground which will take a considerable period of time to work out. Nothing further of any importance in alluvial mining has occurred. Enclosed I send plans of surveys of part of the One, Two, and Three-mile Creeks. On the One-mile there has been constructed lately an expensive tail race, belonging to O'Brien and Co. They got their chief supply of water from Hurdle Creek. Yackandandah and Nine-mile Divisions. (Thomas G. Kennan, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 Prospecting claims have been taken up on sour newly discovered quartz reefs this month, viz , on the Scandinavian, Polar Stir, Danish, and Caledonia Reefs. The richest looking stone is that from the Polar Star Reef, but from the want of crushing apparatus none has as yet been tried. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 Alluvial mining \u2014 Horse puddling mills 7 Hydraulic hoses 4 Wheels for draining claims ... 57 Miners have been very busy during the month in both the above-named divisions, an ample supply of water for all hands being available.

The three first mentioned reefs are situated in the neighborhood of Twist's Creek, the Polar Star being about half a mile north-east from Henderson's Reef.

On the Comasino and Henderson's Reefs, claimholders are fully occupied, some in tunnelling to find the reef, and those who have got the reef, in raising stone pending the advent of a crushing machine. In quartz mining claimholders are still energetically pushing forward their works. On the Comasino Reef, Nos. 1 and 2 south, have amalgamated and commenced putting in a tunnel to intersect the lode. On Henderson's Reef the shaft in No. 1, south, is down nearly one hundred (100) feet and being driven both east and west; they have not as yet struck the reef. The necessary plans for the quartz lease oh the Comasino Reef, applied for last month, have been duly prepared according to the leasing regulations, and forwarded to the Chief Secretary's office. This is the first mining lease applied for in either of my divisions. [This report arrived too late for publication last month.] A lease has been applied for on the Polar Star Reef, and the necessary plans, &c, ac cording to the regulations sent in to the warden to await the fourteen days allowed for objections. Some splendid specimens have been got from this reef, but owing to the want of crushing machinery the yield cannot be ascertained. The Danish Reef has been nearly abandoned, only one claim being at work. Yackandandah and Nine-mile Divisions. (Thos. G. Kennan, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 I herewith forward a plan of portion of the Yackandandah Creek, from Township Bridge downwards, prepared according to instructions contained in Circular No. 60 | 3271.

The tail race numbered 3 is one of those extensive tail races mentioned in former reports, it belongs to the parties mentioned in my September report as not likely to re-open their claim, but they have determined on persevering, and are now nearly ready to re-commence working.

Creek claimholders in both divisions having completed the repairs ren dered necessary through the floods, are with a few exceptions fully engaged; the same may be said of hill and bank claims, all having a full supply of water. The population has suffered a slight decrease, owing to the Wahgunyah rush, but as a general rule, these rushes are the cause of but a very temporary depression in these divisions, most of the miners who leave returning after a very short absence.

Though when a quantity comes to be washed I do not think, from reports, that they will average more than 1 oz. to the cart load, taking the depth of dirt at from one to two feet. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Several claims have a quantity of wash dirt on surface waiting for water to wash out. So far as proved all the leads are very patchy. During this month four (4) other leads have been discovered, namely, Eureka, Rose of Victoria, Perseverance, aud Garibaldi, at about 120 feet in depth, and from 1 foot to 2J feet thickness of wash-dirt, and averaging from J to 5 dwt. to the oil can. So far all the claims are dry, though ex pected upon each lead soon to come into wet ground. All shafts require slabbing from surface (even upon dry ground), in consequence of the surface water filtering through, and the flaking of the red clay, which has caused several deaths in the sinking. The quartz machinery has not been kept in full work. One machine has only crushed 67 tons for tbe month, which produced 200 oz., or about 3 oz. to the ton. Of this about 20 tons=108 oz. 5 dwt. (Maiden's Reef), which is considered the best in the district. Of the quantity one ton was from Wahgunyah Diggings and produced 2 oz. (surface cap.) The other machine has crushed about 100 tons of refuse quartz from the Magenta Reef, which only averaged about 8 dwt. to the ton. The price of crushing is per agreement, vary ing from 20s. to 40s. per ton. During the last month with the excitement (still continuing) to the Wahgunyah rush, I have no mining news to report of the old leads in this immediate district, except that they are principally taken up by the Chinese, who are, from reports, averaging good wages, even for Europeans. The wet workings, at depths over 200 feet, are not turning out at the lower end of the Old Indigo and Chiltern Leads as were ex pected. The water being troublesome and expense of engines, &c. The Stock Yard Creek has again been thought payable, and from prospects got at a depth of 225 feet, and 5 feet of wash-dirt, averaging 1 oz. 5 dwt. to the cart load.

There has been a constant and steady fall of rain all over the district, in just sufficient quantities not to do any injury to the dams, the inspiriting effects of which upon this gold field is quite grati fying, as this branch of mining more nearly concerns more or less the entire population in the number of men and animals it employs, the maintenance for which is something enormous, taking at the lowest estimate for each puddling mil), two horses and four men. Taking this season, so far, it has undoubtedly been the best ever yet known on Bendigo. their claim ; a water shaft is being sunk to the depth of 200 feet, water level being 150, when it is expected the rich stone will again be cut which was lost meantime by Guss, who had already penetrated into the water as far as he could go single handed. Victoria Reef. \u2014 This line is, with the ex ception of one or two claims, entirely at work, they are working through the various claims, a good spur situated on the back of the Old Victoria Reef, in some claims it has turned out very well. The Victoria Quartz Mining Company crushed from it 11 tons, yielding 17 oz. of gold. The Endeavor Company are still working the White Lead and showing very good returns. The Hercules Company have a body of stone at least 8 feet thick, which yields all through 1 oz. per ton; the stone being near the surface and a large mass, and having also their own machinery on the spot, an excellent 16 horse-power, driving 12 heads, they ought to raise and crush for 15s. per ton, which shows a handsome margin for tbe shareholders. Quartz Mining. \u2014 This branch does not show itself so visibly to the eye, one might walk over the entire length of one of our richest gold-yielding lines without being a bit the wiser, or even knowing where the principal operations were being carried on ; there is very little show on the surface, as everything is carried on underground, excepting the in dications of their whereabouts, namely, the various pieces of machinery which are kept constantly at work night and day. Quartz mining is gradually becoming more developed, more ground is being taken up every day in the out districts, where I am happy to say some good permanent reefs are being opened out; those at the Axe Creek, both south and north, are turning out some fine quartz averaging from J an oz. to 7 oz. per ton, with large bodies of quartz. I expect something will be done shortly by the claimholders in the way of erecting good and efficient pump ing and crushing machinery. The Victoria Gold Mining Company are steadily progressing, their eastern shaft is nearly completed and the level from the engine shaft is driven past it (east shaft) several fine spurs were cut through in the level bearing into one focus like a V and evidently making into one at a greater depth as is often the case ; we may expect to hear good results shortly from this company when they shall have extended their depth and carried along their piping. There is another spur to the very east side of the hill which was lately struck by the Try Me Well Company, who have crushed from it some very good stone, several shafts along the line to search for the same body ; it is to be hoped it will turn out remunerative. Birds Reef.\u2014 The West of England Company are steadily persevering; three of their batteries of four heads each are kept constantly going, and I believe they are doing very well. Birds Reef Company are almost now completed with their pumping machinery, the water level here was so shallow that the company found it absolutely necessary to erect their pumps, more es pecially as the stone below water mark was found so much richer than that above, and I believe some portion of it yielded as much as 7 oz. per ton. Mr. Wraight, immediately to the north, with a four horse engine, crushes from his claim about 50 tons per week yielding on the average 1 oz. per ton. Larma Reef.\u2014 This line is likely soon to be brought into active work again, there is a company called tbe Larma Reef Pioneer Company who have taken up by lease a large area of ground, including that very rich claim of Guss and Company, which in several crushings yielded 92 oz. per ton consecutively. It is a private company of about 40 \u00a35 shares, 20 of which were given to the Guss's for Tyson's Reef. \u2014 This line has proved itself not inferior to any on Bendigo, so far as it has been worked, and I am sorry to say that this has been confined to three or four claims. The claim of Enghisch and Myers, 61 feet long, has been a remarkable fine one, the yield has been regularly between 1 and 5 oz. ner ton never loosing sight of one reef or another, and any thickness of stone ; it has placed several of the original shareholders in an independent position. To the south of this comes the Tyson's Reef Company, com posed of 16 original shares, which have lately been subdivided, but very few were sold, the company preferred holding wholly in their own hands ; they have a splendid 30 horse power engine pumping and crushing; the pipes are down 220 feet and the reef is being drained to that depth ; at present they are working a fine body of stone, in some places 23 feet thick, regularly scaled and possessing"], [516, "322 MINING SUBVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 NOVEMBEE. doubt, but that if this extensive waste were properly prospected, many important gullies and now unknown rich localities would be discovered, which would thus afford to the individual miner, who is now obliged to depart miles away from his home, a means of sub sistance without the expense and loss of time he has now to undergo. all the properties of a regular gold bearing reef; last crushing yielded 3 oz. per ton, and the present one is expected to be equally good. Along with this report I send down a plan of the New Chum and Victoria Reefs, showing the position of each claim held by miner's rights and those held by lease, as well as the position of the various reefs in the locality and all the gullies; for next month I send down a section of the entire line with cross sections of some of the workings.

I regret that I have not been able to make the survey I expected in time for this month's report. Eaglehawk and Huntly Divisions. In quartz mining, Messrs. McNair and Co., of Specimen Hill, Sailors' Gully, are now putting up an extensive addition to their present machinery, and the Anglo Reef Com pany have nearly completed their new engine; both of which will be reported on at greater length when they commence operations.

No new leads have been found. Most of the old ground continues to be industriously worked ; the average remu neration to the tub and cradle miner is moderate; whilst the puddler is well paid for bis labor, owing to the shallowness of the auriferous materials, and consequently the facility afforded of obtaining a continuous supply at his machine. From the large quantity of rain that has fallen, all the dams are well supplied, and a scarcity of water during the ensuing season is not apprehended. The Long Gully Reef continues to give a good average yield, and is regularly worked. The various other reefs have not been suf ficiently tested. In all cases where trial stone have been crushed the results are satisfactory. A great absence of good machinery pre vails. The expense of crushing most of the stone in the immediate neighborhood of Heathcote (Caledonia Reef excepted) is 30s. per ton, exclusive of cartage. Redcastle or Balmoral. \u2014 In this locality quartz reefing is much improved. There are two quartz crushing machines at work there, and one in course of erection. At Staffordshire Flat the number of allu vial miners has much decreased, the ground being nearly worked out. There was a slight rush from there to Spring Creek (about five miles distant in the direction of the Goul burn River), but mostly all returned sadly disappointed. An area of about three miles square in this neighborhood is thickly intersected with auriferous quartz leaders, varying from a few inches in thickness to two feet. Many of them are proving highly remunerative, whilst others have been registered or abandoned. Nearly all crop out at the surface of the ground. Quartz Mining. \u2014 The inhabitants of the district of Heathcote are at length becoming conscious that the permanency and pros perity of the place will become in a great measure dependent on the yields from the quartz reefs. A larger quantity of stone having been raised than any preceding month, a confidence of the ultimate success of most of the reefs being evidently enter tained by the claim holders, and an apparent desire to speculate in quartz reefs by persons who were hitherto indifferent to such matters, embolden me to report a progressive improve ment for this month. At Spring Creek some good reefs have been struck, but as there are no crushing machines within nine miles, and the road being bad, cartage becomes expensive, so that a few only continue to be worked. The following returns show the monthly crushings : \u2014 The Caledonia Reef. \u2014 A partial suspension of the works took place, in consequence of the pumps becoming injured, which had to be replaced by new ones. The engine not being sufficiently powerful to pump the water, and work a battery of twelve stamps, a secondary engine of 12 horse-power has been erected temporarily, pending the arrival of an engine of 50 horse-power, which has been ordered by the company. The water is now pumped to a depth of 235 feet, so that an opportunity exists of taking out a much larger quantity of stone than previously. A new reef has been struck by the com pany at a depth of 180 feet to the west of tbe old one, which is expected will give a large yield, it being eighteen inches in thickness. A double shaft is being sunk on the west side of the reef, consisting of two compart ments, one for pumping the other for raising stone. Norris Reef\u2014 This line of reef appears to be valuable in proportion to its depth, the last crushing being the best obtained yet. It is Bteadily but not extensively worked.

MARYBOROUGH MINING DISTRICT. Maktborouoh Division. (D. O'Leary, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Heretofore, prospectors in this section of the division had been laboring under con siderable disadvantage, in being compelled to have their quartz carted to Sandy Creek, or laterly to Maryborough, a distance of seven miles. This in itself has been sufficient cause to impede the working of many reefs (adjoining Chinaman and Havelock Flats) which from what has already been known, would bring favorable returns had there been crushing machines in the immediate vicinity. Trewithian Reef, recently discovered and situate some 40 chains N.E. of Mosquito Reef, is and has been for some weeks the best paying reef in this division.

Inglewood.\u2014 The alluvial miners in this locality bear but a small proportion to the mining population, as will be seen by the above statement, and are chiefly engaged in shallow sinking (from thirty to forty feet) and surfacing, the Daly lead, which has been laid off under the frontage system, being the only alluvial sinking which exceeds 100 feet in depth. This lead has not as yet been suf ficiently tested to report upon with any degree of certainty, the miners having met with a very serious obstacle in the shape of water, necessitating the erection of whims, &c , to assist in baling.

There is scarcely any change to report in the state of the division, either in alluvial or quartz mining. Several small rushes have occurred during the month, but none of them have been sufficiently developed as yet to merit notice. Wattle Flat continues to employ a cou siderable*number of men, and many are doing well.

There are at present over seventy (70) reefs at work, and although many of them being in the same meridian are very pro bably a continuation of one, they are at such a distance as constitutes them separate reefs.

Several rich claims have been bottomed recently, the estimated yield from which is from 3 to 5 oz. per load, with wash-dirt varying in thickness from 10 to 18 inches. The course of the lead is better defined since the bottoming of these shafts, and the general opinion at present is, that it will join the Rocky Flat Lead, as it has taken a decided turn in that direction. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Rocky Flat and Rocky Point. \u2014 Nothing of any consequence doing on these leads pending the settlement of the vexed question, the legality of the frontage system. The company belonging to tbe engine claim on the former lead are said to be doing very well, although they are not very communicative as to the amount of their earnings, they having a lease of the paddock. The two other companies that have erected machinery lately on the same lead, have not as yet struck payable gold, but are of opinion they will do so No. I o p. m- o ta Number of Tons Crushed.

Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 on the latter lead are still doing very well, and I am in hopes that ere long I will have the pleasure of reporting that it is affording employment to a large number of miners. (R. English, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 Kangaroo Flat. \u2014 The rush near the head of this flat has subsided, no new ground of any extent having been opened lately ; it has however, been the means of the old ground in tbe vicinity getting a thorough searching, and many very fine patches of the precious metal have been discovered ; occasionally a handsome nugget turns up to reward the per severing miner. I estimate the population engaged in mining to be about 400. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 Quartz Mining. \u2014 The new reef on Ballaarat Hill, of which I made mention last month, is not yielding so well. The prospectors have had some stone crushed lately which did not realize their expectations; they are, however, sinking deeper, and are of the opinion they will ultimately get it to pay. It is at present from 6 to 8 feet in thickness. i The Carnabian Reef, near Mount Gieenock, is improving. The prospectors have se veral tons of stone ready for crushing, which look very well. Many other claims are taken up, but none as yet have struck the reef. The lease of 10 acres applied for on the Staffordshire Reef has been refused, owing to parties objecting to the issuing thereof, and is at present in full work under the Miner's Eight. Price of crushing, (per ton) quartz 20s. to 25s., cement 20s. Depth of rainfall at Avoca (per meter), during the month of November, is 0.87 of an inch. I send you a plan of the Mia Mia Flat .Diggings, connected with the Hard Hill, as shown on plan No. 2, last month. The diggings in general are quite shallow, and in some places are very rich. Many beautiful nuggets at various times have been found, and from the large extent of grouud that yet remains comparatively untried, I am of the opinion that much gold yet remains to be discovered. Parts of the flat having been opened at different periods has caused it to possess a variety of names in places, such as Tick Nickle, &c. The flat supports a settled population of over 300. A slight decrease in the number of miners has occurred in this division since last month, consequent upon reported new discoveries having been made in various other portions of this, and the Ararat districts ; those remaining in this division still continue to make a good living. On the Avoca Main Lead, the Chinese Company working in the wet ground are reported to be doing remarkably well : a nugget, weighing nineteen (19) ounces, was obtained by them last week, and by their combined method of working tbe ground, I am of opinion, now, that eventually they will succeed in discovering the long lost Avoca Several companies are at work on the Mia Mia Reef (shown on plan) but no crushings have taken place therefrom for a length of time.

I beg also to enclose copy of my Field Book containing notes of traverse lines necessary for connecting the whole with the Avoca Township, the aggregate length of which, for the northern section of my division is, seventeen hundred and nine (1709) chains, equal to 20 miles 29 chains. There appears to be a great want of system in this class of mining, especially upon ground situated similar to this reef, which is at au elevation of one hundred (100) feet, at a surface angle of 45\u00b0, consequently, by com bined action of adjoining claims, tunnels at the base of that elevation might advanta geously be opened, at much less cost than sinking in each claim, at the same time cutting all the veins or leaders as they progress, thereby proving, at that level, the character of the ground, also with more certainty of striking the payable lode, (ifsuch exist). St. Abnatjd Division. (Charles H. Raven, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Lamplough, (with occasional small rushes, either to the deep lead or to the immediate vicinity), still retains its population. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 At Woodstock, the miners have nearly all migrated, in consequence, I apprehend, of the deep rock sinking, and from the fact of the most auriferous looking portion being in purchased ground. A prospecting claim in this ground is now being sunk, with a view of allowing the miners to work upon reason able terms, should it prove of a payable nature. This claim is already sunk thirty (30) feet in basalt, with indications of water at that level. The latter circumstance may be the primary cause of the miners removing to other localities. The Amphitheatre at present appears to be the workings most in favor in my division, and within the last few days has received consideiable additions to its population. The sinking varies from twenty (20) to thirty-five (35) feet, principally upon hills, where there is no defined lead or gutter, but the auriferous drift is found payable several feet thick, which renders it a remunerative working. The above statistics have been formed from police returns and personal observation. In forwarding the report of this district for the month of November, I must crave the indulgence of your Honorable Board, for omitting to forward with this and my last report auy plans of workings in my division : when opportunity permits, I intend making a traverse of a portion of the division, so as to lay down all the old alluvial workings and principal ranges, with the quartz reefs at present at work, as I think the peculiar position and formation of these gold bearing reefs, will form matter of interest to your Honorable Board. At Four-mile Flat the number of miners have slightly decreased without any other noticeable change iu mining. I beg to forward tracing of a plan of the northern portion of the Avoca Mining Division, showing the position (by actual survey) of all gold workings and leased land.

The population is as follows : \u2014 At tbe St. Arnand Gold Mining Company's lease no great improvement has taken place since my last. They have succeeded in breaking through the western reef about eight feet thick, and are continuing their present level (at 100 feet) to strike the eastern reef. The western reef has but little prospect of gold in it, the shaft, in my opinion, being too far south ; the same rule holding good on this and nearly every other reef on St. Arnand as that which 1 explained in my September report of the Chripolite and Ballaarat Reefs, viz., the dip of gold continuing with the strike of reef. On the northern end of this reef (Sebastopol) I washed from five buckets of debris about \\\\ dwt. of gold, and as they are now about to try some quartz from the same place, from the appearance of the stone I hope 'in my next to be able to report a return of more than half an ounce per ton. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 Wilson's Hill has been purchased from the original claimholders by a company styled the St. Arnand United Quartz Mining Company. The yield of gold from the claims hitherto worked, and the quantity of stone yet un worked, if properly wrought, would almost guarantee this company rivalling any other as yet in existence. Messrs. Walker and Company, on Stuart's Hill, are still raising quartz averaging 8J oz. -iper ton, the vein being from two to three feet thick. During this month \u00a32500 was offered for one share in this claim. I am credibly informed \u00a33000 has been paid for j\" share in claim and \\ in machine.

When I last visited this place there was not more than forty at work. The accompanying tables will show a very marked decrease in the number of quartz miners, and a greater increase in the number of alluvial miners. The causes are the partial or entire suspension of mining operations of six out of eight public quartz mining com panies, and the men thereby thrown out of employ, as also many of the railway men being obliged to have recourse to alluvial mining for a subsistence.

The Wattle Gully Company are preparing for more extensive operations, proposing to work the alluvium, much of which, in side claims adjoining the company's lease is yield ing very good wages to individual miners, whose success has inspired new confidence in the company. Many of the puddlers, by perseverance and long hours, realize a good living ; but for this division to continue remunerative, greater attention must be given to the quartz reefs, which continually afford proof of their remu nerative character, if spiritedly prospected and are sufficiently numerous to afford per manent and profitable employment to a large population. The Eureka Company which, from its ante cedents and promises, ought, ere this, to have returned a good dividend, continues idle, pro fessedly awaiting a reorganization. Two new reefs have been opened in Camp bell's Creek, and very good prospects ob tained therefrom. New claims in continuation of the lines of Bolivia, Nuggety, Sebastopol, Old Quartz, and Burns' Reefs have been opened, with remunerative results, and afford proof that the line of reefs, now so partially developed, will ultimately be worked as continuously as on Bendigo or other gold fields. The Fortuna Quartz Mining Association has been re-formed under Ireland's Act, the new company (having purchased the claim and plant of the old company for \u00a32060) have started with a capital of \u00a35000, in \u00a31 shares, and have entered into contracts for the exca vation of a reservoir and erection of steam engine, crushing machinery, pumping and winding gear, &c. ; whether the new company survive the erection of machinery i3 doubted by some of the old shareholders, who are consequently selling out. During the month the Nuggety Associated Quartz Slining Company have commenced crushing with their 30 horse-power engine and 12 stamps, which had been removed from Campbell's Creek, and very substantially erected on the reef by some of the share holders, nearly all of whom are thoroughly practical working men, and from their intel ligence and experience no doubt can be enter tained of theii success. The Cappers Reef Company are not pro gressing so satisfactorily as when last reported, the run of gold then working being lost, and the company having no reserve fund, tbe working miners, who are principally share holders, have magnanimously gone on on half wages rather than the works should be sus pended. Hobby's machine, erected on a continu ation of the same reef, has also been started, causing this formerly dull locality to become, with its long line of working shafts, as lively and promising a scene of mining operations as we have in the division. The Specimen Gully Quartz Mining Asso ciation have temporarily suspended operations, the cause is scarcely obtainable. In their last report they return 906 tons crushed during the quarter, which yielded 345J oz. of gold ; such a return asought to have given adividend, but all profits have been expended in ex traneous works, and the directors attribute their tardy operations to defective machinery* and the constant attention and repairs neces sary. The Old Quartz Hill Company are pur suing the even tenor of their way; no stop page of any moment has occurred since they started ; the mine has been thoroughly opened, and the whole of their splendid machinery works night and day without hindrance. They are employing 45 men, and realize a weekly return of 56 to 60 oz. of gold. I have before recommended this as a model company, and well worthy a visit from anyone inter ested or engaged in mining operations. I could not possibly complete any plans and sections for forwarding this month in conse quence of the numerous dispute cases on Crown and private lands I have had to attend to on the ground and in the Warden's and Police Courts during the month.

Of the Cumberland Reef Company I re ported tbeir last crushing of 70 tons, the work of four days, yielding 60 oz. of gold, making \u00a3400 worth of gold in a fortnight, from 174 tons ; this was excavated from the old shafts, about 80 feet deep, and from a lode 13 feet thick, at a depth of 125 feet, and gave great promise of realization of long expected success, but their operations are again retarded by the badly manufactured machinery \u2014 their engine and stamps would work, but they are short of water, their amalgamating apparatus and their pumping and winding gear is defective, causing"], [525, "MINING ST.BYEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 NOVEMBER. 331 Refokt of Population, &c.

And on Summerside Reef about 3300 lineal feet are at present occupied, but have only so lately been taken up, that nothing definite can be said at present. Hepburn Division. (Amb. Johnson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 On Richardson's Reef, near Connell's Gully, no proper defined reef has been struck, but from the surface-leaders as much as li oz. of loose gold has been washed off a dishful of mullock, and Mr. Woolnough, the proprietor, has shown me several capital specimens from said leaders. I have not heard of any of the other claims having struck quartz yet, but the reef is in all probability a northern con tinuation of either the Nuggety Reef, or the Welcome (Connell's) Reef; and 1 have there fore very little doubts but that a good reef will ultimately be discovered. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The New Nuggety Reef, Connell's Gully, as far as I can learn, still maintains its good name, and fully answers the expectations of tbe shareholders. From the Welcome Reef, the average for tbe month has been about J oz. per ton \u2014 an amount amply remunerative by a systematic manner of working such as here introduced. On Wombat Reef, the Cornish party is still clearing a handsome weekly dividend, and I understand that Messrs. Spence and Company intend shortly to work the portion of the reef coming through their puddling claim south of the Cornish party. On Collier's Reef, an extended claim ha3 lately been taken up by Messrs. Sampson and Company, and I consider that they have a very fair prospect of success. The number of the European portion of our mining population has not undergone any perceptible change, but Pickpocket Hill has lately engrossed the attention of the Chinese, and I should estimate the number now on the ground at between eight and nine hundred. In steam machinery no increase has taken place as yet, but it is more than probable, that in Yandoit several more will shortly be erected both on reefs and alluvial workings. In the Jim Crow portion of my division, quartz mining has not during the past month, produced anything specially worthy of remark, with the exception of the first crushings from two reefs, for some time being prospected, having proved remunerative. On the Summerside Reef, Keepit-Dark Gully, the prospectors, Messrs. Shell and Company, have for upwards of seven months been engaged, and their trial crushing last week of 5 tons, produced about 2J oz. per ton. On Melvin's Reef, head of Blind Creek, Messrs. Adams and Needham's engine and crushing machine, lately removed thither from Benoil's Reef, Doctor's Gully, have, I understand, been in full operation for some time, but I have not heard with what result. On Parker's Specimen Reef, dry diggings, operations have lately been suspended, pending the conclusion of arrangements for machinery. From the Beehive Reef, in the same locality, I learn that the reef still looks well, and that the last crushing averaged upwards of 3 oz. per ton. On a number of reefs for some time deserted, claims have lately been taken up, in most instances by Ballaarat parties originally at tracted to Yandoit by the extraordinary yields of the Pioneer and the Hamburg Reefs.

On the Homeward Bound Reef, a southern continuation of the Great Reef, payable stone is being raised, but 1 have not hcaid of any crushing during the last month. On Finlayson's Kccf the prospectors are getting a trial crushing ready, and it is ex pected that the reef will prove satisfactory. In Yandoit, no marked improvements have taken place, but the various prospecting parties are working vigorously. Some of the parties having reached the water level have been compelled temporarily to suspend opera tions, with a view of amalgamating a number of claims and procure machinery, or else having the advantage of all the claims being baled at the same time. Gold has been struck by tunnelling for tlio Donna Maria Reef; and on New German lieef and Cosmopolitan Reef, matters have, during the mouth, remained as usual. During November comparatively few crush ings have taken place, a number of parties saving their quartz with a view of having it crushed at the Great Reef Company's ma chine ; and, I trust, when that machine has started crushing, that I shall have to record as payable a great number of claims now prospecting on all of the principal ranges in Yandoit. Quartz Mining, while it is the most perma nent and generally the most profitable, is also at the same time the most expensive descrip tion of mining operations, and the association of capital with labor therefore becomes abso lutely necessary. However, there can be no question that Yandoit affords abundant in ducements for legitimate enterprise, and it is to be hoped that the attention once attracted will take permanent root, and fully devclope the resources of the district. Puddling and sluicing have, during tho month, remained unchanged ; the supply of water has been sufficient, and tho average yield, on the whole, satisfactory. The previous summers have taught most of our puddlers a lesson, and I know only very few instances, where ample provision for storing a supply of the liquid element for the summer, have not been made, where any way practicable. In the prospecting claim on the Hamburg Reef, two fourth-shares have lately shifted hands at \u00a31000 each, the original share holders to retain their shares in all quartz raised previous to the sale. Messrs. Ritter and Company, on the same reef, claim No. 28, are at present engaged crushing a stack of some 170 tons, expected to average at least 5 oz. per ton. No. 3 South is sinking, but have not yet struck any reef, and the rest of claims, having struck water, have amalga mated, and are making arrangements for the erection of machinery. The ground on Shepherd's Flat, applied for under mining lease by Messrs. Flaxman and Company having been declared forfeited, has lately been taken up by individual miners, and I expect this summer to see a number of fiats on the Jim Crow Creek, below tho ground just mentioned, in full work. I am fully aware that the opening up of these flats will, in most instances, prove rather heavy on the individual miners, but I have also very little doubt that gold will be found in sufficient quantities to pay. On the Glamorganshire Reef, first rate prospects are now and again obtained, and the parties are, therefore, in excellent spirits. As yet only a number of leaders have been found, but the line of reef being a southern continuation of the Hamburg Reef, there is every reason to expect that the reef, when struck, will be first rate. In tunnelling, the only news of any interest is that the basaltic hills along Jim Crow Creek, north of Shepherd's Flat, have mostly been taken up, and a number of tunnels started. On Elevated Plains, Italian Hill, aud Stony Creek Ridge, the most of the ground, having been fur some time deserted, is now occupied in extended claims, and the weekly proceeds per man, as near as I can learn, varies from \u00a33 to \u00a35. On Pioneer Reef it was reported that Messrs. Steclc and Company had sold the prospecting claim for the sum of \u00a318,000, but I am not able to say whether the sale was effected. No. 2 North is still turning out first rate, and I have been informed, (I know not with what truth,) that No. 3 North had struck gold this last week. A large number of claims are taken up, but several are registered for excess of water or other reasons, and the rest sinking in search of the lode. On Fiery and Sebastopol Hills, Deep Creek, the ground above the Ballaarat Company's tunnel is also pretty well occupied ; and from all I can gather, those working in the gutter have no reason to be dissatisfied, and on the whole, I may say that the tunnelling portion of our population are doing well.

Besides the Hit or Miss Company, the following paddocks have been leased: about 63 acres of Mr. Morrison's paddocks, about 30 acres being Mr. Morrison's home paddock ; Touon's paddock in two lots of about 30 acres and 50 acres respectively ; about 10 acres of Tonkin's paddock and about 15 acres of Ends lie's paddock, and of all these there is not one which does afford favorable inducement. Several gullies and flats about Yandoit are being prospected but I have not heard of any successful parties as yet. In Boots and adjacent gullies a few parties are still earning a living with tub and cradle but their number is daily decreasing. The best instance of good luck in that locality, that has come to my knowledge, was the discovery of a 39oz. nugget in Clausen and Company's tunnel. Boots, Bald Hill. The party has been working there some time, now and again coming across a small nugget, but in consequence of an accident by which Clausen's brother uufortunately was killed, the ground was temporarily abandoned, but after some time fruitless prospecting else where it was re-occupied. I have not been able to finish in time my surveys for geological plans of Yandoit ; I trust however that I shall be in a position to submit plans, &c, next month in accordance with your instructions. The upper part of Boots Gully is occupied in extended claims, and the ground being properly drained, opened and faced out, an immense deal of stuff is weekly being turned over, and the parties, as far as I can learn, are getting well paid for their labor.

The population is as follows : \u2014 The Grand Junction Company, Yandoit Plains have just started their shaft, and I have great hopes now, of seeing my often expressed opinion, that a lead of gold came through the plains, verified. Farther north, some extended claims granted to companies, and awaiting the arrival of machinery, have been the scene of disturbances between Europeans and Chinese, but on the people being informed by Mr. Daly, the warden, that the ground was al ready granted, quiet was again restored. The machinery is as follows In New Nuggety Gully, famous for the splendid nuggets there discovered, nearly all the inhabitants of the gully have united in the formation of three companies of working shareholders for the purpose of working the ground on a better system. The three parties, consisting of 60 shareholders, have taken up 800 yards in length of the gully, and intend if practicable to cut one main drain for the three blocks of ground, and then face out and puddle the whole of the gully, and I am pretty confident that in a few months, when the companies have fairly got to work, we shall hear of some more splendid specimens of the precious metal.

They tried a prospect last week, which pro duced 12 dwt. to the ton, from a reef live sect in thickness. Stephens and Company, on tho Emu, got 60 oz. of gold from 100 tons of stone; and Higgings and Company, of Higgings's Reef, crushed at their own machine last week 120 tons of stone, from which they got 60 oz. of the precious metal. Paddling and sluicing is being carried on with the usual amount of activity that pre vails in this district. In almost every in stance are the former taking the alluvium from the surface to the bed-rock ; so that, as far as the older gold fields are concerned, this branch of mining must be \" used up\" in a very few years. Mining Companies. \u2014 The Old Pennyweight Hill plant has been purchased by a party of miners, who intend erecting it at Kangaroo, near the Table Hill, for cement crushing. In tunnelling, however, I trust we have many years of prosperity before us, as in few instances are the hills in the vicinity worked to any great extent. InTable Hill several new parties have struck the lead, which is proving itself to be as good as in the older claims. In one claim, occupied by fourteen miners, gold to the amount of \u00a317 per week for each man is now being extracted. There are many instances of cement having been thrown away as useless, now producing from 1 oz. to 3 oz. per ton. The Chapel Hill Company's engine, of 20 horse-power, is also the property of working men, and is being removed to Vaughan, also for crushing cement. The Windlass Hill plant and lease has been purchased by Mr. Henry Baker, au iron founder of Castlemaine, who intends prose cuting the works with vigor. The El Dorado Company is working steadily, and making very fair average re turns. They have been crushing some stone during the last few weeks which has produced over 6 dwt. to the ton. I have, however, to report that great ex pectations are being formed of another hill, named after the warden, \" Heron's\" Hill, on which a prospecting claim was granted three weeks since. The hill is of similar formation to the Table Hill ; it is, in fact, one of the line of continuations of those table lands which extend both up and down the Loddon River from Table Hill. It is about four square miles in extent. The prospectors have commenced tunnelling it, so that in a month or two the result of their prospecting will be known. The Ferron's Reef Company has been doing remarkably well, some of the quartz producing over 1 oz. to tbe ton. They have made a considerable prosit over their working expenses during the last month. The Vaughan Company is, however, the most successful one in the district: within the last three months, dividends to the amount of \u00a322 on each of the \u00a3100 shares have been declared. This profit is derived from crushing auriferous drift that will not pay for sluicing. The company have many years work within their claim if the ground yields as well as it has done hitherto. At tho foot of the hill on the Loddon bank these men discovered payable gold, and a small rush has taken place in consequence. A tin dish of stuff was washed here in my presence, when, in addition to several specks of gold, various small rubies, of the size of duck-shot, together with specimens of either black sand (tin) or a kind of emery. I am, however, collecting samples to send you at rny earliest convenience. This hill is situate about five miles to the south of Fryer's Town. Tabadale Division. (Thomas Turner, Mining Surveyor.) Quartz Mining. \u2014 In quartz mining a decided improvement has taken place. From the prospector's claim on the Liverpool Reef ten tons of stone were crushed, producing (101) one hundred and one ounces of gold. This is a most astonishing yield for this district.

Three privileges have been taken up this last month for sluice-washing parts of the banks of the Cobban River near Taradale. This is a mode of operation very suitable to the locality on account of the plentiful supply of water, which facilitates the working of poor ground. And where there is but a thin population, the occupancy of large areas is very admissible. Two applications have lately been sent in to lease ground on an abandoned quartz reef situate at Kangaroo Hill, which is 3J miles (south by west) from the township of Malms bury. One application is for six acres, and the other for four. This reef was extensively worked for a length of 500 yards some two years ago. There are two largish veins lying contiguous on the surface but diverging downwards, one dipping to the westward and the other to the eastward. The line of strike bears north 12\u00b0 west. N.B.\u2014 All the other horse puddling machines have ceased to be worked, and there is but ono at which work is likely to he resumed. The resumption of work on these poor auriferous lodes is a remarkable instance of the necessity of capital to render the resources of the mines profitable, and proves the su perior power of machinery over that of merely manual labor in developing the mineral riches of the country. There has been a very sensible diminution in our mining population of late, but it is difficult to state the exact amount of the de crease. By report I have the information that at Clowes Forest there are not above fifty miners remaining on that gold field. And the late rush to the Campaspe River, three miles below Mr. Mitchell's station, has declined to about thirty miners. Another instance, proving the advantages of capital in mining operations, has coma under my notice in a case of another aurifer ous reef which was once abandoned, and by reason that manual labor alone could not overcome the accumulated difficulties. Since the opening up of that rich little spot called Victoria Gully, in the month of July, there has not been another successful field discovered, or one that has proved sufficiently remunerative to engage the labor of any good amount of miners. At Char coal Burners Gully, there are only about fifty men employed, and at the Survey Paddock not more than twenty, yet I am still of opinion that both these localities are likely to prove to be highly auriferous, should a larger space be tested at some future time. The making known instances like the above I think tend to prove to the mining population the wisdom of encouraging the expenditure of capital in gold mining. The reef just now alluded to is known as the Frenchman's, and is situate 2J miles (south south-west) from Malmsbury. Two extended claims had been granted to different parties some time back. The lode has now been extensively worked, twelve tunnels having been driven under the hill side varying in length from 200 to 350 feet. One of the two parties has just applied for an additional 320 feet along the lode adjoining his former claim, and purposes excavating a new tunnel at a lower level, and which will require a length of 700 feet to reach the lode. The endeavors of the Prospecting Asso ciation to develope the golden resources of this district have turned out very unsuccessful as yet. So little discovery of auriferous de posits has been made that the discouragement has induced one half of the subscribers to the funds to withhold their donations, thereby necessitating the suspension of operations, at least for a time. This is much to be regretted as perseverance might bring finally its due reward. These mines lie under a hill of volcanic formation, there being 100 feet of trap rock, under which is a stratum of diluvium varying in thickness from eight to twenty feet con taining a little gold, and yielding in some places as much'as 4 dwt. to the load of earth : Although mining operations have worn rather a dull aspect of late, yet the affair is No. Horse-power, .lluvial mining \u2014 Steam engine employed winding and puddling 1 12 Horse puddling machine 1 [uartz mining \u2014 Steam engines employed in crushing, &c. 4 40 Water-power engine em- ployed in crushing, &c. 1 Horse machine employed in pumping 1"], [532, "MTNINO SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 NOVEMBER. 338 under this is silurian sandstone, mostly of a pale color, and through which crops out the quartz reef. The reef is highly ferruginous : in some parts it is 20 sect in thickness, but in others it runs completely out. Its strike is north 18\u00b0 west, and its dip is to the west ward at a small angle from the perpendicular. Gold has only been found on the western face of the reef. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The party who has applied for the addi tional piece of ground affirms that the yield of gold is but a few pennyweights from the ton of quartz ; however, he seems fully satisfied with the remuneration, and expresses his intention of expending \u00a31000 more in the speculation. The quartz reefs seem to be the prime feature in this gold field, on which will probably depend its prosperity as a mirring district. At the Barfold Ranges there are ten mines being successfully worked, at the Victoria Reefs there are four, at the Humboldt two, at Belltopper Hill three, at Kangaroo Creek three, and at the Malmsbury diggings there is one. During the month of November it will bo seen by referring to the foregoing tables that the number of quartz miners has decreased from 126 to 97; this is owing to a rush to Fern Tree Gully, or the upper portion of Happy Valley, the report of large finds of gold in which has induced some of the quartz miners to turn their attention to alluvial mining for the present. It will also be seen on deducting 300 (the population of the Baw Baw Gold Field) from the total number of miners, that there is a decrease of 54 in the number of All the above mentioned are yielding gold; besides there are four new reefs under trial, showing very encouraging indications, and there are five mines temporarily relinquished, being secured to their owners under the privilege of \" registration,\" making in all 32 mines in this Taradale Division which promise well as lucrative investments of capital and labor, not only to their immediate proprietors, but also to the various trades thereby called into requisition aud to the general community, all of whom indirectly reap a benefit from the prosperity of their neighbours.

Another nugget weighing 42 ounces, and several other smaller nuggets, are reported to have been found during the past month. There are many gullies in the vicinity of One-tree Hill that would, I have no doubt, yield as well as Fern Tree Gully, but they have never yet been prospected. Everybody here seems to be waiting for somebody else to prospect and open up new ground for them, hence our hundreds of untried gullies. St. Andbbw's Division. (James Murphy, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 At the Yow-yow Hill tunnelling is carried on very rapidly indeed by the Smythe's Creek Mining Company, who have now driven to a distance of 560 feet. I have no doubt that within 40 feet more of tunnel they will strike Allen's Reef, 60 tons from which, at the last crushing (a week ago), yielded 3| ounces per ton from quartz taken out at a depth of 78 feet. The Yow-yow Hill Mining Company have completed 60 feet of their tunnel, which brings them within 50 feet of the lode.

This is a description of company well calculated to dcvelope the resources of a locality where individual enterprise might fail for want of means and where the capitalist will not venture, because he cannot understand how profits can be derived from mining on so small a scale. Nevertheless, I am of opinion that companies such as this will succeed in realizing profits, when those on a large scale end in disappointment. I attribute this to the active local supervision of the shareholders, who manage their own affairs through one officer, chosen from amongst themselves, instead of being left in the hands of a distant and practically irresponsible directory. The price of crushing at this machine is to be \u00a31 per ton. This is tho lowest rate of charge for which quartz has been as yet crushed on this gold field, and I have no doubt that its effects on the prosperity of Anderson's Creek, and in stimulating quartz mining in that locality, will very soon be apparent. The machinery consists of a bat tery of four stampers and a small Chilian mill for amalgamating. A new reef, called Cameron's Reef, has been discovered during the past month on one of the ranges on the right bank of the Old Caledonian Creek, and within one mile of Queenstown. The thickness of this reef varies from six to twelve inches at the sur face and to a depth of ten feet. A lot of 4 tons yielded 1 oz. to the ton, and from the indications it is considered that the vein will improve in richness with the depth. At the Britannia Gold Field the miners on Sassafras Creek and its tributaries have been doing rather better than usual during the past month, their average earnings being above 10s. per day, but from the continuous wet weather the amount of water that flows out of every gully makes the working in this creek very troublesome, and frequently causes great loss of time. On the other parts of this division not mentioned in this report nothing worth noting has occurred during the past month. Addendum. \u2014 I hare been informed by a party recently returned from the Baw Baw gold fields to Queenstown that their average earnings were twelve shillings per day while in the former locality, which, taking every thing into account, was not considered remu nerative. I am informed, however, that a piece of ground jumped from McCrea's party on Pheasant Creek yielded 2 oz. per day per man to the jumpers. At Anderson's Creek the works of the Yarra Yarra Mining Company have been re-com menced; ten men were employed on this company's ground when I made my usual monthly visit to that locality. The crushing machine which I mentioned in my last report as being erected by Mr. Capper is completed, and was to commence crushing on the first of the present month.

I may here spe cially refer to the opening of Yandoit and Inglewood, to which localities many of our miners have been induced to migrate in consequence of the richness of the quartz reefs. The quartz reefs within this division which have proved to be auriferous, are as follow: \u2014 Township Reef, Cemetery Reef, Soldier's Hill Reef, Milkmaid's Reef, Swamp Reef. It will not I hope be understood that I am of opinion that mining the deep leads is an unprofitable occupation, although reviewing the present state of things there is reason to believe that with many others such an opinion is gaining ground. I still hold that under a system of well directed labor, with efficient machinery to overcome the difficulties such as water &c, and with the assistance of correct scientific data to direct them in the selection of the most favorable site for the sinking of shafts \u2014 deep mining would not only be profitable but there would be found in stances of splendid fortunes being realized. The extraordinary richness of the auriferous deposits sound in some of the claims would fully justify this conclusion, were it not that the most wild ideas of chance had been re sorted to to fix the position of the shafts (such as throwing a brick over the shoulder) in such claims, even in cases where the sinking of tho shaft has cost from five to eight thousand pounds. The quantity of ground occupied as mining claims on frontage leads is 31,680 feet in length, by 200 feet in width=145 acres. The quantity of ground occupied as block claims is 220 acres. The quantity of ground occupied as mining claims on quarts reefs is 150 acres. Total number of acres, 515 = '\"j] of a square mile. I have the honor to report, that during the past month milling in this division has been particularly dull ; perhaps in no previous month during the year has there been fewer occurrences of interest in this line, and this I cannot attribute to any sudden change that has come over mining affairs, but to a gra dual falling off of energy on the part of the capitalist, or a diversion of the capital to newer fields; and this again may be attri buted to the fact, that from the want of some thing like accurate knowledge of the courses and depths of the leads, the shafts of some of our largest companies on the deep leads are situated at very great distances from the gutters, and the levels are frequently put in too shallow, thereby necessitating main drives and tramways of a great length, and blind shafts or inclines \u2014 the construction and re pairs of which absorb a great proportion of the profits of the mine, so much so, that not withstanding the gross yield of the wash-dirt may be tolerably good, the net profits from the working of deep leads is comparatively small. The great quantity of water to be contended with in working of gutters also acts as a drawback to the profitable mining of deep leads, especially in cases where blind shafts or inclines have to be used, and these difficulties and drawbacks have the effect of deterring many persons from embarking in this class of mining operations. In taking a view of the progress of mining in this division during the past twelve months, there is no possibility of disguising the fact, that a gra dual falling off in deep mining is taking place ; in comparing the present condition of the leads with their condition this time last year, it is clear they are not in so prosperous a condition ; a great portion of these leads have been worked out. and no new discoveries have been made, and other gold fields are opening where fewer difficulties are met with, and where perhaps greater chances of re- This haphazard mode of fixing the sites of shafts has frequently resulted in the shafts being entirely useless or where the company has endeavored to make such shafts avail able, the expense of working from them has proved so great as to render them worse than useless. From the magnitude of the operations to be carried on in pursuing deep mining, and the very great outlay necessary, it is clear the most cool deliberation should be resorted to in the first instance. The geological for mation of the strata of the locality should be thoroughly investigated, particular attention being paid to the angles of inclination of the bed-rock, and its general tendency to fall in any given direction. This would, in most instances, point out to a great degree of accuracy the proper situation for shafts, and thereby save a great amount of mis-spent money. Unfortunately this has been very little attended to in this division, and tho consequence is that many of the companies are now experiencing the ill effects of this want of caution. The companies on the several leads are continuing their operations with ordinary success, but nothing has transpired in con nection with any of them worthy of being specially reported."], [539, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 DECEMBER. 343 From the great extent of this division, and the fact of the population being so much scattered, I find it impossible to forward a correct return of the population, including all classes, without incurring very great expense; the table forwarded shows correctly the number of registered miners, also the mining plant. together with the cost of raising and deliver ing, crushing, amount crushed, &c. : \u2014 No. 2 Division.

Even many Europeans are com pelled to work as hired laborers on the mines, railways or public roads, whenever they can get a chance, and they acknowledge this to be preferable to the precarious livelihood picked up by fossicking. Though there is a large tract of alluvial ground in the district, which I believe would well repay the enter prise of the prospector, still nothing has been done, nor is it likely anything will be done in this matter as long as the eyes of the miners are turned to the quartz reefs.

It will be seen by the returns herewith forwarded that there is a decrease in the number of the European miners engaged in alluvial mining, whilst there is a slight in crease in the number of Chinese. Nearly the whole of the old leads in my district are now deserted except by the Chinese. I have to report that quartz mining generally is still in a prosperous condition, and that during the last month several new crushing batteries have been erected. There are not at the present time so many miners engaged in prospecting for quartz lodes as there were last month, but there is a decided increase in the number engaged in raising quartz. No. 3 Division. (Thomas Cowan, Mining Surveyor.) The mining population is as follows : \u2014 The average yield from the quartz con tinues to be about the same as I have stated in former reports, but the quantity of gold varies from 3 dwt. to 8 or 9 dwt. to the ton. One company, the Canadian Hill Company, is not at the present time obtaining more than 2 dwt. 18 gr. to the ton, and they are still carrying on their work with energy, from which fact I presume that the small yield named is found sufficient to pay current expenses at least. Total number of persons residing on the gold fields within my division, about 17,500. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 I have been informed by the manager of this company that a yield of 3 dwt. 12 gr. to the ton of quartz would give a very hand some return at the rate at which the company are now crushing. This fact serves to show the great advances that have been made in quartz crushing operations, and the improvements are found, not only in the machinery itself, but in the general working of the claim. It must however be remembered, in order that the figures given may not mislead per sons about to engage in quartz mining, that this company have a wide lode and great facilities for raising quartz at a small expense, and they are therefore able to work more cheaply than other companies not so favorably situated. The Old Canadian Company's quartz averages 5 dwt. to the ton, and from this, dividends averaging \u00a312 per share weekly are obtained. * Six in course of erection, three of which are winding engines.

The company have great facilities for raising the quartz, as the lodes are found nearly on the surface, and the employment of wages-men enables them to raise a very large quantity. The plan will serve as a basis for a series of levels between the various claims, so that the lodes will be shown, and a beginning made in obtaining that information which is so necessary for the thorough understanding of the run of quartz lodes. Tredennick and Company, on the Golden Point Lode, still continue to work for about 3 dwt. to the ton, and that this pays some thing more than expenses is proved by the fact that the company have been at work for some time. Any future sections which I may forward of the quartz lodes within my district will, therefore, be easily traced upon the plan, and the information as to dips, &c, readily obtained. The Enterprise Company have sunk a new shaft at a distance of about 120 feet from their old shaft, and have struck the lode, which is found to be 8 feet in width at a depth of !20 feet and 7 feet in width at a depth of 85 feet. The trial gave 15 dwt. to the ton. Since this company commenced crushing, on the 25th March last, they have obtained 3000 oz of gold, which have given dividends amounting to \u00a3600 per man, after paying all expenses. The last two weekly dividends were \u00a324 and \u00a316 per share. By reference to the plan it will be found that a theory emanated some time ago, and which received some degree of support, namely \u2014 that quartz lodes were bands of quartz descending in a perpendicular direc tion, and did not run north and south, is not borne out. The facts go to show that a lode is one continuous run of quartz in north and south directions, and with dips of various inclinations, and though it may not have been traced for some distance, it is found in a due north or south line from the original starting point. Reference to the plan will show that this view has many facts in its favor, if it be not absolutely proved. Three new batteries are now in course of erection within my district, the whole of which will probably be at work by the time my next report is forwarded. The return of the area of ground actually worked has been drawn up from a careful measurement of the plans in my possession. In accordance with ray instructions I beg to forward a return showing the number of distinct auriferous quartz lodes which have been struck within my division. Notwith standing that the claims in which lodes have been struck extend over a wide area, only six distinct ones have been found. The total area of ground which has been occupied for mining purposes is 3'25 square miles, out of which 175 miles are actually occupied by companies at work. In the return, I have adopted the general opinion and have followed the nomenclature generally in vogue, namely \u2014 that a lode is considered to be the same when found at in tervals on north and south lines, A very wide interval may exist between the points at which the lode has been found, but the general opinion is, and the evidence of such opinion very strong, that there is an actual run of the same body of quartz. The return of population within my district has been arrived at by calculations based upon the electoral rol!s, and the number of houses assessed by the municipal council of Ballaarat East, due allowance having been made for the proportion between married and unmarried persons. The mining statistics have been compiled by a personal visit to each claim. Thus, for instance, the Oolden Point Lode has been found in the Perseverance Company, Black Hill Flat, and in the claim of the Golden Gate Quartz Mining Company, Ter rible Hill, at a distance of 210 chains. The various lodes have been struck at different intervals, which will be seen by reference to the plan. The claims are all laid down from actual measurement, and the fact that quartz lodes have been struck in due north and south lines for a long distance, will lead to the inference, if it does not actually prove, that there are in reality only a small number of lodes, which obtain different names as they are struck by various parties in No. 4 Division.

Total population of all classes, 3050. * The machinery is as follows: \u2014 One company (Midland Counties Company) at Mount Misery, are I believe on the eve of dissolution, as the quartz hitherto obtained has not been remunerative, or at least not sufficiently so to induce the furnishers or owners of the crushing plant lately in use by the company to allow them the further use thereof The plant in question was originally furnished by a late member of the company, who unable to pay for it in full, was obliged to mortgage it for the balance, some \u00a31000 or \u00a31200, to the firm from whom it was pur chased, who under an order of the Court of Mines got the entire plant sold, some three months since, to the present furnishers, who it appears are now about removing it under the impression, after eight or ten weeks' trial, that the Mount Misery stone will not pay. The company, however.think otherwise, and assert that if permitted to retain the plant a few months longer, they would be certain to meet with paying quartz, even though they should sink to a depth of 80 or 100 feet therefor. This company, unfortunately like many others, com menced operations with little or no capital, in expectation that if they could by any means manage to get up crushing machinery, all would be right; the invariable result, however, is that if such companies be not successful in obtaining paying stone at the very outset, they become disheartened, and in most cases a dissolution takes place whereas if they could afford to prospect the reef thoroughly, most probably they would ultimately succeed in obtaining quartz that, if not very rich, would at any rate be made to yield remunerative wages, under an efficient and well ordered system of working. Approximate value of all mining plant in the division \u00a341,750. Number of distinct quartz reefs actually proved to be auriferous, 5. Number of acres of auriferous ground actually worked upon, 300. I have the honor to report, that during the past month mining operations in my division have been conducted with somewhat less than the ordinary amount of energy, owing no doubt partly to the intervention of the Christinas holidays, as well as to a partial want of water in portion of the old shallow workings There has been no rush, discovery, or other event calling for particular mention; nor have the quartz reefs been yielding very satisfactory returns during the month. The Quartz Prospecting Company, at Paddy's Gully, referred to in my last report, have not yet been successful in striking the reef, nevertheless they are inclined to per severe, and are now engaged in sinking anew shaft, a few feet to the westward of the old one which has been abandoned some few weeks back after having been sunk 60 feet, at which depth a drain or level was put in, 30 feet to the west, but with no positive result; they, however, intend sinking 100 feet before opening out, and if there be a reef in the locality, they are resolved upon pros pecting it thoroughly. It will be seen by reference to the above tables, that there has been of late a consider able decrease in the number of quartz miners; the number (250) formerly quoted, being 77 in excess of the present number (173) \u2014 but then it would appear there has been a some what similar increase iu the number of alluvial miners, the present number (1070) being 90 in excess of the former number (980). There had been a very marked diminution in the Chinese population throughout the district, of late, attributed chiefly to the superior attractions of the up-country gold fields. * These figures only include the population on and in the vicinity of the gold fields within my division, such for instance, as the population of Rokewood and l'inield, (vide district plan,) as I do not consider persons residing southward of these townships to be residents on the gold fields, or at all connected with mining affairs.

Deep Leads \u2014 I have nothing new to report of the deep leads in the division, matters remaining in much the same state as reported in my last, and indeed, generally speaking, it may be said that little or no change worthy of notice has occurred during the month with the exception, perhaps, of some two or three claims that have been occupied, as already stated, at the Log Hut, where it is to be hoped some new ground will be soon opened. On Splitters' Lead, several companies are now getting gold, and though in general the re ceipts are small, yet there are some handsome exceptions. The working population number some 100 No. 5 Division, persons. A report circulated respecting the favorable prospects obtained by a Government pros pecting party, for some time past employed in developing the auriferous resources in the neighborhood of the Log Hut (about six miles north-east of the Staffordshire Beef), occa sioned the occupation of a few claims then, but as yet with no particular result. The prospectors after sinking several shafts, vary ing in depth from 15 to 30 feet, have at length struck deep ground, their present shaft being 70 feet and as yet unbottomed. (J. W. R.

The Mentor Company has been doing rather better of late than was their wont, and the fact of No. 11 South having realized 13J oz. 14 dwt. from 70 tons of stone raised from a vein od their immediate boundary tends to brighten the prospects of the southern por tion of the reef considerably.

Quartz Mining on Hiscock's Reef. \u2014 Two companies, viz., the One-and-All and the Standard, have started their batteries during the month, which work exceedingly well ; and I have no doubt but that in my next report I shall be able to state that the yield is remunerative. The Golden Gate Company, at Scarsdale, have obtained 90 oz. for the last week's return, this claim is esteemed very highly. The Smythe's and Browne-'s Junction Shaft is now through the rock, and into a thick bed of black clay; they have got the largest steam engine in this part of the district. The Imperial Company has been at work with thejisual average yield of about 7 dwt. The claim is situated in No. 3 allotment, private property. The Bute Company, on allotment 4, are fast progressing with their shalt, and with the erection of machinery. The All Nations Company, on the All Nations Reef, has crushed about 250 tons, with an average yield of about 8 dwt. These are the only new features observable in Smythesdale Proper within the past month. Through the Christmas holidays the usual quantity of work has not been got through in the district, consequently but little altera tion has taken place during the month. The same monotonous aspect prevails at Browne's : quartz reefing there is the only branch of mining which seems now to en gage most attention, the alluvial ground having been to a considerable extent worked out or in possession. No. 6 Division. On Monkey Gully the Magna Charta Com pany have at length struck paying gold; it appears that they have been for some months driving in a wrong direction. The gutter runs within about 30 feet of the shaft. At the time of my visit they had not attained the lowest point of the gutter, however I ob served about 4 sect of good wash-dirt in the face of the drive. The wash-dirt is largely intermixed with quartz boulders, black sand, and decayed wood remains. The bottom is a hard green sandstone. The slope of thu reef is very precipitous, which affords a strong presumption that the gutter will be narrow ; every indication of a good paying claim can be at present seen here. (John Lynch, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows :- The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The Scarsdale and Gemini Companies, south of the private lands, Scarsdale, have already bottomed two bores, and have proved where the deep ground exists. These companies, as well as the Magna Charta, being so far in advance of any worked ground, will be the means of giving a fresh impetus to mining in that quarter. At Spring Dallah the Try Again Company have abandoned their tunnel on which they expended sixteen months' labor; they are about to commence a new shaft in the Devil's Kitchen, by this they will avoid 150 feet of basalt rock, but will be under the dis advantage of having the shaft at the ex tremity of the claim.

The Edinburgh Company, Flying Buck, Glamorgan, and other companies on the Standard Lead are working away with their usual success. The weekly returns in these claims vary considerably. The lowest re turn from them proves a healthy state of mining at Linton's, whilst the Flying Buck, probably the best, has given dividends of no less than \u00a340 per man for several weeks in succession.

The miners at Bullarook have not yet tunnelled to the gutter.

There have been no alterations in the works of the company ; the whole of the machinery is in good order.no perceptible result has been obtained from the test of metal plates and blankets at the foot of the strikes, thus satisfactorily proving the utility of the company's mode of obtaining the gold. In correction of my last report I have now to state that the company, by the use of their amalgamating boxes, are possessed of about 437 oz. of alloy, which will give about seventy-five per cent, of gold. This would, upon their old system, have been lost. The work performed per head of stamps, averaged the last fortnight per twenty-four hours work, was 2 tons 8 cwt. 66 lb.

This company also crushed 8 tons of tailings from the Sons of Justice claim, Bald Hill Lead, which yielded an average of 5 dwt. to the ton. Criterion Company are reducing about 150 tons of quartz weekly, the yield of which has averaged 11 dwt. per ton ; they have about 8000 tons of stone opened out for raising to the south of their main shaft, and about 7000 tons to the north of it. There is nothing new in the working of this company. Mer cury boxes are being fitted up, on the same principle as the Port Phillip Company, in place of the blankets heretofore used. The company are building a new kiln, and erect ing poppet heads 50 feet high to deliver the quartz on a tramway to the kiln. The Friendship Crushing Company have crushed 700 tons tailings and headings during the month, yield 130 oz., or an average of 3 dwt. 17' gr. per ton. The Frenchman's Quartz Company have crushed from the 24th November to the 22nd December, 381 tons of quartz, yield 122 oz. 14 dwt. 18 gr., or an average of 6 dwt. 11 gr. per ton ; this quantity is the greatest crushed in the time by this company, and is attributed to raising the stamper bottom to a level with the gratings. Clunes United Company have completed their tramway from the new main shaft to the back of the battery, upon which iron rails are laid to assist in the conveyance of the trucks. They have adopted the use of copper plates and amalgamating boxes to save the gold; it is also intended to use iron lifters in the battery at an early date. Tbe mine is being opened in a better manner. Crushing operations will be commenced on Tuesday next. The prospecting party had 25 tons of quartz from Opossum Reef tjrushed, which yielded 30 oz., or 1 oz. 4 dwt. per ton. The company have started sinking a permanent shaft ; four more claims (two to the north and two to the south) have been taken up on this reef; to the east of Opossum Reef two claims have been taken up on another reef on which the prospecting party have got gold ; also to the west of Opossum another quartz reef has been taken, on the cap of which, likewise, the prospecting party has got gold.

I have the honor to forward the following report of the miuing operations in this division during the month of December. Alliance Company have discontinued the sinking of their shaft ; they are down about 180 feet, arid find the water too heavy for working with a horse-whim only. I learn an engine will shortly be brought on the claim for the better working of the ground. There are nineteen distinct places of mining operations on the quartz reefs in this division and known by their respective names as different reefs, but in many cases they are the production of each other, as in the reef marked in the general plan A., Mount Egerton, the south end of which is known as the Little Hill Reef, and the north end Big Hill Reef; also the reef marked V., the north end is known as Trench's Reef, the south end Parker's Reef ; some of the reefs although found to be auriferous have not had any sufficient quantity crushed from them to enable a result to be arrived at, while others have yielded as high as 23 oz. per ton. Clunes Mining Company are raising quartz from the Welcome Reef, which is from 7 to 8 feet wide. The stone has not been sepa rately tested ; but from the increased yield, as shown by the Port Phillip Company, I infer that it is a very paying reef. Robinson's Reef still continues to be 30 feet wide, and tbe timbering of the worked portion is very solidly fixed. A new engine of 60 horse power will shortly be fitted up to work the mine from the northern shaft. Alluvial Mining. \u2014 The Young Sons of Free dom are still working as heretofore ; they have not fitted up a battery of stampers as yet. This company, as also the John Bull party and the Southern Lights Company, are earning from \u00a33 to \u00a34 weekly per man. The Sons of Justice, North Clunes, are getting wages. The total linear measurement of mining operations on the reefs in this division is 14,600 feet, and the area of alluvial workings, including Gordon and Mount Egerton respect ively, is 30 acres, or the total area of au riferous workings in the division is 6} square miles. This division still presents an extensive field for prospecting, as highly auriferous in dications and even a little gold has been found in many places, but hitherto little has been done to develop its alluvial resources \u2014 the miners in the division are to a great extent without the means to go prospecting even if they were disposed to do so, but in most cases they are of an easy non-enterprising disposi tion, preferring to plod about a few patches of already discovered ground where they can scrape up a subsistence, and our business people, whose interest it would be to assist Gordon Division.

At 54 feet they came on to a false bottom of pipeclay and slate, 6 feet thick and lying horizontally, and on which they got a little gold ; under this bottom they got 6 feet of yellow clay, and then got into a hard slate colored drift clay, through which they have sunk 24 feet, making the entire depth 90 feet, but have got no change of stratum yet. Jane Hope Company (south end of Lone Star Reef) are sinking in a shaft on the lode, from a depth of 50 to 60 feet; the lode is 5 feet thick, but they do not take out more than 2\u00a3 feet of the east side ; they have not had any crushing this month. Homewardbound Reef. \u2014 Tbis company has commenced work this week; it consists of 18 working shareholders ; they are about to raise quartz from the old shaft, and at the same time continue to sink a new main shaft on the east side of the reef, so as to strike it at 100 feet deep. All the other companies aud reefs on Gor don are at a standstill. On the south side of this gully a party is washing surfacing ; they have taken off the surface to a depth of 7 feet, and expect it will pay them yet several feet deeper. Mount Egerton. \u2014 Rose Company (Little Hill Reef) have started their machine, it works well, the whole of which is of a per manent character and highly finished; they have crushed several tons of refuse quartz, partly to try the engine, the yield was 2\\ dwt. per ton. They have adopted an appliance which I believe cannot be brought too gen erally into use \u2014 it is supplying the batteries with hot water ; their supply comes from the condensor of the engine, conducted by a pipe along the stamps, having a stopcock at each battery, about three feet above the bed of the stamper boxes, the water flows into the boxes through the aperture round each stamp shank, and the water after passing through the boxes and over the tables (which are 12 feet long) retains a heat exceeding 80\u00b0 Fahr.; the advan tage of this process during all changes of external temperature is very evident, as it keeps the surface of the quicksilver in the boxes and tables clean and ata high warmth, in which state it is more ready to retain and amalgamate with any gold coming in contact with it. At present they are not working in the mine as they have now a large quantity ready at the machine. On the Western Gully there are three parties at work; the sinking is from 15 to 30 feet, dry. They are making \u00a33 per man per week. Steiglitz Division. (Thomas Woolgrove, Mining Surveyor.)

Since my last report, through the kindness of one of our quartz crushers, who no doubt feels interested in the profitable investment of capital in gold mining, this company has had about 4 tons of quartz crushed, free of charge : the result was 2J dwt. of gold to the whole amount; which, no doubt, was wholly received from the mercury which had been for some time previously used in gold collecting. This amount, with what had been previously collected, makes about 1oz. of gold received by a public company after nearly two-thirds of their capital has been paid up and expended, and from ground which has yielded at the rate of 46 oz. of gold per ton, from 15 or 16 tons operated on at a time.

Notwithstanding the difficulties with which gold mining as a remunerative enterprise, either individually or by public companies, has had to contend, it is gratifying to report increasing indications that on this field, ultimately, it cannot fail being an important source of wealth. The private party adjoining north, known as Jones and party, No. 9, holding about 90 feet of ground, having had their ground drained by the above company's deep sink ing, commenced operations about eight weeks ago, have taken out about 60 tons of quartz, and, from 30 tons crushed, have, during the last month, realized about \u00a3200 ; this is from the white vein above the slide. On Steiglitz, the public companies, with one exception, have as yet done nothing of a remunerative nature, but in every instance their operations demonstrate the certainty of gold mining becoming a remunerative enter prise under skilful management and judicial legal enactments. Of the public companies on Steiglitz none have been in the position of prospecting parties. The ground they (the public com panies) occupy has all been previously prospected, and the veins found, yet only one began their preliminary operations under scientific direction, and this, the Albion, is the only company who have been able to work their ground with profitable results. The works of this company are at the north of this ridge as yet worked ; they have not been in operation long, have sunk a new pumping and winding shaft, erected their machinery, raised quartz, crushed them, producing from 10 to 6^ oz. per ton ; met all their expenses, paid a divi dend of 12 per cent, on the capital paid up; this amount is not half of their stock. In previous reports, by drawings and sec- tions has the principal ridge on this field been brought under the notice of the Board as containing two distinct gold bearing veins, \u2022 with little variations extending north and south in a straight line, broken at short dis- tances longitudinally and vertically, the dip longitudinally is north ; in one instance only, to my knowledge, do the breaks alter this order of the dip; the underlie or vertical lie is to the east, the breaks and slides tend to the west ; the deepest wrought ground is on this line and is the ground taken on lease by the public companies. The Perseverance, the oldest company on this field, took up ground on Boxing Reef, which had been worked by two distinct parties whose operations confirmed the fact that the surface or red vein, containing oxide of iron, was a distinct one from the white permeated with sulphuret of iron, antimony and other metals, as also that by a shift of the The workings demonstrate the site of the shaft judiciously chosen in reference to both veins, even should the shift longitudinally exist in their ground, which has been found in the Boxing Reef, and also in the New Chum Reef.

The Morning Star Company, who have obtained a lease of the ground formerly held by the Invincibles Company on the Victoria Reef, have erected a 25 horse-power engine on the ground, and commenced operations energetically. The former proprietors of this ground were obliged to abandon their under taking, owing to the great difficulties of water and inadequate means to overcome them. The ground has, in one individual claim, proved itself the richest on this field, from 29 to 39 oz. per ton having been obtained from it for a long succession of crushings ; but at the north end it dipped so fast from the Allies Company's ground, that the Invincibles could not follow it. This company is a great ac quisition to this portion of the field, and I have no doubt by my next report some good returns will have been made. prietors and the present company, have ceased operations ; their works, machinery, &c, are allowed to enjoy nature's repose, only being disturbed by tbe levelling pro pensities of wind, rain, and oxidizing decom position. The Malakhoff party, the most enterprising, industrious and persevering body of miners on this field, have continued their operations under unjustifiable impediments; their limited space of ground adjoins the Gibraltar on the north and the Steiglitz Company on the south; the Gibraltar, as before mentioned, have been standing idle for months, with a drive and shaft 40 feet under the Malakhoff's present workings full of water; their profitable work ings and ground are wrought out to this level ; they cannot sink without the certainty of being swamped out with water from both sides, and are therefore forced to employ themselves in a poor block left in tbe upper ground, which has not hitherto proved remunerative. As this company does not weigh the quartz crushed, their profits are only known by the returns in proportion to the time or labor expended. The yield, however, has never been excessive, whilst their operations have been most injuriously hindered by their neigh bors' operations or idleness, aud their limited extent of ground. The Wellington Reef Company have had no crushings for some time. The Steiglitz Company have struck an auriferous vein* to the north of their main shaft. They are still continuing the sinking of their main shaft, which from reports there is now reason to suspect is beyond the break or slide in the main vein, where if the sinking is continued, will bottom on the white or barren vein ; this will not, however, be the less profitable for the company, the piercing of the vein as it joins the slide will drain the whole of the upper ground, in which there is still an amount of gold-bearing quartz which will keep them at work for years. The New Chum Reef Company are not at present working their ground, but confining their operations to the erection of their machinery and crushing apparatus, making dams, &c. Their engine-house is nearly com pleted, as well as workshops, and the works generally are being pushed forward with great vigor. Judging from the works already completed and those begun, and from the drawings of machinery, the general arrange ments and experience of Mr. Trench, one of the proprietors, who is superintending the whole, this work when finished will be second to none in Victoria. In all probability, every thing will be ready for starting in about a month's time. The hundreds of tons of quartz tailings, and other auriferous material belonging to this company, already stacked around the premises waiting to be operated on, is sufficient evidence that the speedy com pletion of these works must be as great an object to the proprietors as to the miners on this field generally, our present extracting apparatus being either deficient in power or defective in principle for the crushing of quartz without hand-picking, or operations on a large scale with limited results. The Cosmopolite Company, adjoining the Steiglitz at the top of the township, have for a long time left their powerful machinery (a hand windlass) carefully to superintend itself, while the underground works have again been allowed to resume the rest they have for so long enjoyed. Nothing has been done south of the Perse verance ground for some time. The Bir mingham Reef, the Union Company's, and Sailors' Reef Company's ground are left un disturbed, whether for the advantage of science, the colony, or the proprietors, is not generally known ; but after twelve months this inactivity will contribute less towards solving the perplexing question whether gold Nothing has been done as yet on the New Redan Company's ground, and the Gibraltar Company at present, owing to some unfor tunate quarrels between the original pro- * This vein is at a much higher level than the bottom of shaft, and is evidently the white vein bearing anti mony. &c, before referred to."], [551, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 DECEMBER 355 concretes, where it is found, or aggregates from other bodies through segregation, than the busy bustle which for years have disturbed their chemical or mechanical actions, if in operation.

Previous to fixing any machinery, &c, they are testing the ground in various places by prospecting and stacking the different masses of quartz, awaiting the machinery now in course of erection by Messrs. Pyke and Trench. On New Year's, the Prospect Claim and No. 1 South are still producing very rich quartz, and have had several crushings since 1 last wrote, which have averaged from 6 to 10 oz. per tan. The ground north and south of these claims is very much broken, and great difricu! ties have been met with in finding the two veins existing in the above claims ; consequently the ground is comparatively abandoned, pending the driving to the extent of their claims north and south in these two claims.

Tbe deep sinking is still being carried on, but unexpected difficulties in the shape of a series of hard basalt rock, 120 feet in thickness, have materially retarded their operations. The Dolly's Creek Diggings have been for a long time, and are still at present, very quiet and dull ; the only fresh feature, beyond the old workings being again tried, is that a party is at present engaged in cutting a sluice or race from the Lai Lai Falls, twelve miles in length, to Dolly's Creek Diggings. This will furnish a nearly constant supply of water during the whole of the year. At present many places, payable with the near advan tages of water, are left, owing to the late flood bursting the dams erected, and the compara tive drought since. li mropenns. blnese. .lluvial miners ... 270 254 luartz miners 195 465 254 At Work.

Generally this class of mining has been more than usually productive, which has contributed in no trifling degree to the late inciease in the amount of gold sent by escort lately. In my report for the month of November I had to mention the discovery of an auriferous quartz reef, called Wilson's Reef. About 10 tons of the quartz has been since crushed, which produced 5 oz. of gold. This, although a paying yield, is below the expectations of the miners, who looked forward to from 4 to 5 oz. to the ton. The quartz that has been crushed was taken quite from the crop or outbreak of the lode, only a few feet below the surface. BEECHWORTH MINING DISTRICT. Spring Ckeek, Tiirkk-mile and Woolsheo Divisions. (Henry Grimes, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 I have now to report that another reef has been discovered, lying to the westward of Wilson's, and called the Garibaldi Reef. It was struck almost on the surface by some prospectors, who dug out some good speci mens, and have now taken a claim on the spot. Simmons' Reef. \u2014 The operations on this reef by the different parties who hold claims thereon have been carried on for the last month as usual, in a steady business-like manner, yielding, from what I can learn, a remunerative return. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Trewhella's Reef. \u2014 This is tbe most pro ductive in Blackwood in proportion to the extent of operations, and the claim of Trew hella Brothers is going on as usual \u2014 pros perously. The adjoining (Pioneer) company's claim is doing well on the same reef, and shares are being sold at a high rate. Two new leases have been applied for on this reef, one to the north and another to the south of Trewhella's claim. The latter by the United Company, who had a prior lease, and who are now after a short suspension of work about erecting a steam engine to drain the mine, water being abundant. Hewson's Reef. \u2014 Operations on this reef have not been for the last month very active, through an excess of water in the mine, to drain which the proprietors are about to drive a tunnel from Split Tree Gully. These parties have their own crushing machine on the ground, and all I can learn as to the yield of gold is, that it is improving. The Caledonian Company and the Golden Point Company have now emerged, or about emerging, into one, the former having bought, or is about buying, up the latter. From the proximity of the two claims to each other, which you will see marked on the plan I have the honor to send herewith, I judge the arrangement is a judicious one. Alluvial mining. \u2014 I have heard from parties thus engaged, that there have been some good finds during the past month, one man holding a claim near Sebastopol Hill having realized in one day no less than \u00a330. Tbe adjoining claims are doing well, and this one man still going on successfully. The miners are steadily at work, the supply of water being very good considering tbe time of the year. At Bowman's Forest parties are still out perseveringly prospecting in several of the gullies. The remains of the Prospecting Association has been dissolved, and have lately sold their engine, which has been unemployed for some time back. On tbe German Lead they have had considerable difficulty in tracing it ; and, as it is, but few claims have as yet bottomed on the lead. On the Perseverance Lead several claims have been hitherto worked on what is called a false bottom ; but the amalgamated claims of 7, 8, and 9 have struck what they consider the same lead that runs through the prospecting claim, which will give a fresh starting point and guide to the claims below.

I have good hopes of the quartz reefs at Myrtleford ; two prospecting claims have been registered with me upon two separate reefs named the \" Hope,\" and \"Pop goes the Weazel,\" about half a mile from each other; but. as you will perceive, there are but thirty men at present in that locality; most of them are, however, pro specting.

The number of quartz reefs actually proved to be auriferous are five, viz. : \u2014 Henderson's, Polar Star, Scandinavian, Comasino, \u00a9id Caledonia Reefs. The number of square miles of auriferous ground actually worked on, I calculate at llf miles. During the earlier portion of the month miners have been very busy. Hill claim holders washing up their tail races, some of which had not been washed up for a period of from three to six months; and creek claim holders taking up bottom, and in general, both hill and creek claims making a complete clearance, so as to have as large an amount of gold as possible at their command for the Christmas festivities. Up to the present time this season has (at least in comparison with any of the five preceding ones) been the most beneficial I have known for these districts, not alone for the mining, but also for the agricultural interest. With regard to the mining interests a com- paratively ample supply of water has been available for all classes of miners; when I say comparatively ample supply, I wish it to be fully understood as being only in relation to the extent of ground at present in operation of working, as were a sufficient and permanent supply of water available, I am confident from my knowledge of the ground in both divisions, that fully twice the extent, if not more, would be worked than is at present occupied for mining purposes. As is invariably the case a great number of our population who left for the Wahgunyah rush have already returned, preferring a moderate wage, which they are almost sure of getting in these divisions, to the very remote chance of larger returns on the deep leads. Taking into account the rush to the Snowy River in the earlier part of the year, and the later one to Wahgunyah, I may safely assert that this has been a most prosperous season for the mining interest, and that although both my divisions have for the last four years been considered as worked out, I may venture to predict that our resources are only in the earlier stage of being developed. When the vast extent of known auriferous ground, as yet untouched, is taken into consideration, together with the numerous quartz reefs abounding in these divisions, and only want ing machinery to encourage miners to com mence the working thereof, it seems astound ing that capitalists do not turn their attention to these fields.

These are the principal works completed throughout the year ; other tail races are in course of completion, and the Ovens Water Company's scheme for supply ing the Nine- mile district is making fair progress. At present it is almost premature to say if even a quartz reef has been struck in this division, as they have not yet been sufficiently proved. We have about six leaders on the Indigo; namely, Maiden's, Higgin's, Attray's, Suffolk, Staines, and Magenta. From the two quartz-crushing machines here \u2014 one of 18 horsepower (Stephen's patent) has only crushed 113 tons 13 cwt., which yielded 236 oz. 3 dwt. ; of this quantity 24$ tons were from Rayner and Garibaldi (Wahgunyah) leaders, which yielded 50$ oz. The other machine of 7 horse-power has only crushed about 50 tons this month in small quantities from the various leaders, Wahgunyah, which averaged from 1 to 4 oz. to the ton. Three leases have been applied for during the past year, and the necessary plans, &c, forwarded to the office of the Honorable the Chief Secretary. Two were applications for quartz leases, and one for a site sol a reservoir. The various prospecting parties sent out by Government have hitherto proved unsuc cessful. I herewith forward a plan connecting Henderson's, the Polar Star, and the Scan dinavian Reefs with Forest Creek, and through it with the Yackandandah Creek (vide plan forwarded with June report). I also forward sections of four shafts on Henderson's Reef. There are seven leaders being worked at Wahgunyah ; namely, Barkly, Shamrock and Thistle, Glenquhare, Garibaldi, Main and Baldocks, Nil Desperandum and Rayner's.

The population is as follows : \u2014 Very little has been done during the last month on Indigo leads, in consequence of the Wahgunyah rush and Christmas holiday, though, to judge from reports, a good many of the old leads will be again taken up, as many are disappointed with the washing up of the Wahgunyah leads.

The number of square miles worked upon in this division, including both alluvial and quartz workings, is 127 ; but the entire area of that part of the district over which these workings are scattered, is 480 square miles. (R. H. Stone, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 There is no change to report respecting alluvial mining during the month of Decem ber. Owing to continuous dry weather, the Buckland River begins to fall short of the usual supply of water, but not at present sufficiently so to retard sluicing operations to any extent. In quartz mining there has been less done during the month than usual, and the yield of the principal reefs has not been equal to last month. I do not think, however, that there is any permanent falling off in the yield, as the claims look equally well, but in several instances claimholders have been crushing stone that was before laid aside for more machinery ; less has been crushed, as none of the mills have been at work for more than three weeks since my last report, and some of them have been standing longer, undergoing repairs. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Messrs. Wallace and Company, having failed in obtaining payable stone from their claim on the Oriental Reef, have disposed of their steam power machine and plant to Mr. George Colsworth, of the Oriental Reef. Messrs. Wood and Company's machine has been working during a month, and they have crushed 420 tons of quartz from the Oriental Reef. Messrs. Gitchell's machine has been idle a great part of the month, as the workings on Gander's Reef have been sus pended in consequence of excessive drainage, and little quartz has been raised from this reef, and this machine is now principally dependent on it for employment. Pumping machinery is about to be erected for the drainage of this reef. The total population of the Buckland division, including all classes, is as follows: \u2014 Stephens and Company's machine is now at work and has been employed for a week in crushing stone from the Cornishman's Reef, and is about to commence on that from the Woolshed. Considerable delay occurred in starting this machine as the stamper boxes were constructed on the flushing principle and proved a complete failure, and gratings have now been adopted. This machine differs considerably from the others in use here, having square stamp heads instead of re volving ones and which are placed three in each battery and are worked by heavy camb barrels. This arrangement is certainly far behind that of revolving stampers and large batteries, All the other machines in this Note.\u2014 The return of the population is from the last police reports, and the other returns from personal observation and registration of claims.

On the Ovens River steam power might, be advantageously superseded by water power, and for many reefs must ultimately be so, as there are several minor veins in that locality which now yield about 1 oz. per ton, and considering the small bulk of stone to be obtained, and the expense of removal down the very steep ranges where the reefs are situated this yield will not pay for crushing by steam power. On the Nelson Reef, Buckland, Tracy and Company had not commenced crushing on the 31st. having been waiting for amalgamated copper plates for their ripple boxes.

Bird's Reef.\u2014 The Bird's Reef Company have been crushing some very good stone lately, which was taken from below water level ; their water shaft will open up this line, and thereby determine its future value as a permanent reef. Le Capelain and Com pany have had some very good crushings lately ; their operations are steadily pro gressing. Messrs. Wright and Sutton keep their respective engines constantly at work crushing the stone from their own claims on this line, which returns them a handsome weekly dividend. I have the honor to submit to the Board of Science the tabular statement of machinery, &c, for the month of December, with the following statistics, carefully taken by myself personally. Sheepshead Reef. \u2014 This line, as usual, is looking brisk ; the stone from the claims of Wells and Company, and of the Union Com pany on the top of the hill, is being taken all before them as it comes, and crushed indis criminately, which is the only way this large reef will pay, the great mass being poor, with here and there an exceedingly rich patch of quartz. The Red White and Blue, and Hooper's Claims, are yielding very fine quartz, and paying handsome dividends ; other claims are at work, but it is difficult to find the same stone in two claims, the reefs run so irregular and so many of them. The total population of all classes, inclusive, residing on this gold field and within my district only, is 15,300. The number of district quartz reefs actually proved to be auriferous within my division is forty-five (45) out of which number thirty (30) are first-class reefs (having at various times yielded large returns of gold), ranging from a quarter of a mile to two miles long, and being entirely occupied with claims ; the other fifteen (15) reefs are not so well known, although probably equally good, but in conse quence of the shallowness water level few claims have been taken up upon them. Glasgow Reef. \u2014 This line is looking a little better lately ; the water-shaft has been commenced again after being idle for six months, and I do believe that were it sunk to the depth of 250 feet, at least a mile of this reef would be benefited thereby, and nearly every claim would be enabled to sink 100 feet at least below water-level. Some few claims are obtaining payable quartz above the water, and one of the most northerly claims having a good body of stone intend erecting machinery of their own. Victoria Reef.\u2014 The Endeavor Company, the Victoria Quartz Mining Company, Baller stedt's, the Hercules Company, the Albert Company, and several others upon this line, are raising very good stone from the various reefs upon the hill. Hustler's Reef.\u2014 This line is still in abey ance; the Hustler's Reef Company have just completed their drives or crosscuts to the east, and have cut through both eastern and western limb ; this will be sufficient to drain the line, and allow about 20 claims to pro ceed to work again. In estimating the area of ground purely auriferous, I have taken merely that portion of my division which has been actually turned over and advantageously worked upon for gold mining purposes, including both alluvial and quartz, and I find that in my division there are three and one quarter (34.) square miles. There is very little change in my division since my last report, the alluvial miners are mostly all doing well, having had an excellent summer so far for their operations with an abundance of water, which is the principal requirement of the puddler; all the old gullies and flats are being puddled over and over again, and those which were found not payable last year are now being busily worked, and as labor falls in price the greater will be the demand.

The population is as follows : \u2014 between Eaglehawk and Sydney Flat, I have some rough surveys made by myself at dif ferent times, but 1 do not consider them suf ficiently true for submission to the Board; of the others, I believe, nothing whatever is known either as to their figures or their areas. The workings in and about the Whipstick Scrub are extending rapidly, and I am told would be remunerative if water could be re tained near them ; but owing to tbe density of the scrub, and tbe want of means for col lecting, the miner may be said to have no water at all. However, as lately many small nuggets have been found, these gullies may be said to be progressing favorably, notwith standing the difficulties under which the miners labor. Entire population, 10,000 Europeans, 450 Chinese; total, 10,450. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The augmentation in the. number of puddl ing mills during the month of November, is due to the good opinion entertained of this locality by the miners. In the quartz nothing new has transpired, and the only remark I have to make, is that thjre exists still a greater tendency than ever towards the amalgamation of claims into companies as being conducive to the effective and economical working of the reefs. The accompanying plan is a survey of the new lead at Huntly, now known as the Forest Lead. It is in some places very rich, yielding six ounces to the load of washing stuff, (the load at about 24 cubic feet) but unfortunately it is very narrow, being fre quently only one claim wide, the depth of sinking is from 60 to 80 feet through alter nate layers of clay and gravel. The plan requires no explanation, as my placing it on the plan of Huntly, the position of this new lead will be apparent. * Two of these crushing machines are now idie, but will no doubt resume work in a short time.

I have, as far as practicable, forwarded the superficial contents of the whole worked part of the division. It will be observed that I have added to the ascertained number of square miles of surveyed land an approximate estimate of the area of the unsurveyed land, which I should say amounts to about one mile more. This unsurveyed ground comprises mostly the ground now in possession of the miner, all the gullies lying between Eagle hawk Gully aud Sydney Flat, the extensive workings about the township of Neilborough or the Elysian Flat, and the various gullies in the Whipstick Scrub ; some of the latter are becoming very important, and ought to be laid down on the district map.

The Providence Reef is also likely to turn out well. It is intended to erect efficient pumping machinery on these reefs. Teatree Creek. \u2014 The reefs in this locality are still giving good returns, Joiners', German Jack's, Glasgow, and Welcome, having crushed with satisfactoiy results. Messrs. Williamson and Bruntine, have removed their machine from the Junction to this creek, and crushing operations will commence early in January. At the Junction, with one exception, all the reefs are registered or abandoned, Farrel's being the only one'at work. I regret having to report the return of Oliver's prospecting party, without their finding any payable gold field. Several new puddling mills have been erected, but I have not at present ascertained the results from them. Quartz mining is still in a very dull state, nothing fresh having been opened here. The Reedy Creek Quartz Mining and Crushing Company are almost at a standstill ; but I am led to understand that active operations will shortly be resumed. It is also rumoured that Doyle's late claim will again be tried, the registration having expired; this has been one of the richest reefs in the colony. Of the other principal reefs, viz , Leviathan, Captain's, Sailor's, Ryan's, Wallaby, Albert, Wellington, &c, &c, I have nothing new to report, although I understand they are all being more or less worked. On the Strath Creek some excitement pre vails, owing to the private prospecting party, headed by Messrs. Ross and Hotson of Mel bourne, having struck alluvial gold in payable quantities at a depth of nearly 70 feet, and under most difficult circumstances ; the water there having compelled all previous parties to abandon their shafts. The present party have been indefatigable in their exertions, and deserve every suecess. It is in contemplation to give a further trial to some of the abandoned reefs here, which, when opened, gave a very fair prospect. On the King Parrot Creek a leader has been struck in Fortune and Company's engine shaft, and gold obtained at a depth of about 120 feet. The pumping and winding gear erected by this company on the Triangle Lead, although on a small scale, performs the requisite work most efficiently, keeping the shaft perfectly dry ; these works reflect great credit on the parties concerned in their erection. All the other claims on this line are either registered or abandoned ; one claim on Han nigan's Reef is still at work. From the prospect obtained last summer in alluvial sinking on this field, I believe, that with a further trial, with a strong party, pay able results would be realized.

Alluvial mining.\u2014 Nothing of any con sequence has occurred in this branch of mining during the month, which indeed may be characterised by its dulness. A few of the miners are doing well ; a larger proportion are fairly remunerated, whilst the majority complain of being unable to obtain anything like compensation for the labor expended. No relaxation has occurred in reefing since my last report, all the reefs then worked con tinue to be so, the result of the crushings in the majority of them have proved satisfactory, all have paid expenses, some have given a handsome surplus. The reefs in Redcastle on an average con tinue to pay pretty well, new reefs are being daily discovered in the locality. Many of the supposed reefs are only spurs on surface lodes which very frequently run out at compara tively shallow depths.

Most of the Europeans en gaged are those who arc deficient in capital to work a quartz reef, and are merely obtaining a bare subsistence. Ofthe puddling machines at work the Chinese possess most of them. Many of the gullies and flats are totally abandoned. In proportion to the retrogradatiou of alluvial is the increasing of quartz mining, with apparently beneficial results. The social condition of the miners is much improved, their habits are much less migratory, in con sequence of the numerous permanent resi dences which they have erected. The greater portion of tbe reefs gives a fair remuneration for the labor and capital ex pended, the average yield per ton being about l_r ounces.

Quattz reefing has rendered this place more prosperous than any other iu the dis- trict ; the reefs are worked more systemati- cally, and the yield per ton larger. 1000 tons of cement and sandstone have been crushed from Balaclava Hill, which has given an average yield of 7 dwt. The cement from Windlass Flat yields 5 dwt. to the ton. Lamb and Pitman's claim on the Balaclava Hill Reef is yielding 4J oz. to the ton ; some short time ago as much as 20 oz. to the ton was obtained from this claim. On the Albert Reef, in the claim of Francis and Jones, at a depth of 245 feet the reef proper has been struck ; it is over 2 feet in 'thickness, and almost invariable \u2014 the gold is uniformly diffused through the stone, which yields nearly 12 oz. to the ton. At the White Hills, the reefs give on an average 2J oz. to the ton. A 10 horse-power quartzcrushing engine has been lately erected there. A reef in the neighborhood (Clarke's), 6 feet in thickness, near the surface, yields 10 oz. to the ton. Carr's Reef, 3 feet 6 inches in thickness, yields somewhat more than an ounce per ton. Scotchman's Reef, 15 feet in thickness, gives 8 dwt. per ton. All the reefs are being worked vigorously, and with success in most instances. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 There are forty-fout distinct quartz reefs proved to be auriferous, and the number of square miles of ground discovered to be auriferous and partly worked upon, is esti mated at fifty -nine. There have been no fresh discoveries during the month, which is certainly not attributable to any lack of energy cm the part of the miners, who (particularly the quartz miners) always show by their perse verance, how desirous they feel to develop the resources of some of the recently dis covered reefs.

Several good crushings of cement have taken place from this lead during the month. Mr. Stephenson's machine crushed 84 loads, taken from the claim of the United Miners, which yielded 189 oz. of gold ; like wise 134 loads, taken from the claim known as Dirty Dick's, yielded 209 oz. Mr. Morgan's machine crushed 133 loads from a claim known as Harley's, which yielded 236 oz. The average depth of wash-dirt in these claims is two feet get the lease they intend to erect powerful machinery, and give the place a thorough trial. The appearances surrounding the extensive plains in this vicinity naturally leads one to infer that they must be auri ferous. In several places along the Mount Greenock Creek side payable gold has been traced running into them, and the parties were on each occasion prevented from fol lowing it further on account of the super abundance of water. Several express the opinion (and I think it is not at all impro bable) that the mount itself, or the greater part of it, will be found auriferous. On the side of the mount, at an elevation of about 20 feet above the plains, is a shaft over 50 feet deep in the solid rock ; the party who sunk it, seeing no appearance of soon getting through, and their funds becoming exhausted, were obliged to abandon it in despair. On Rocky Flat Lead a few claims are still at work, notwithstanding the pending dis pute. Nos. 2, 3, and 4 Amalgamated Engine Claim East (Rocky Flat is divided into East and West) last week struck the lead, and from a machine of eight loads of wash-dirt obtained over 6 oz. of gold. The sample is a beautiful one being coarse and much water worn, and is considered a good indication of the lead extending considerably further. The depth of wash-dirt is from 18 inches to 2 feet. The shareholders in the engine claim ad joining the private property have not been at work for the last fortnight ; they state that the ground suddenly got poor, and for the last few weeks were not able to make more than \u00a31 per week per man. From the fact of the former claim producing such a fine sample of the precious metal, it is believed that the latter was only on the outskirts of the lead, which is supposed by some to run in a more northerly direction towards Gib raltar, in the Maryborough Division. T have the honor to forward the informa tion required in your Circular No. 60 | 3748. I have been very careful in my calculations, and the principal of the information has -been obtained from my own observation. 'the number of quartz reefs that I furnish have beon proved auriferous, although many of them were found so poor that they are at present abandoned or otherwise registered for a period of three months. It is a singular circumstance, considering how rich the various leads and gullies were, that the quartz reefs in this division have in general proved unremunerative. The reef on Bal laarat Hill, which promised so well at first, will at present only average 4 dwt. per ton. It still retains its original thickness, which is from 6 to 8 feet. On Rocky Point Lead Nos. 1 and 2, 3 and 4 are still working with great vigor, although the greater distance they recede from their shaft underground a decrease in their weekly dividends takes place, not that the auriferous earth is falling off in its yield, but that it is more difficult to obtain. It is not likely that the number of claims on this lead will in crease until the dispute between block and frontage is settled. The Carnubian Reef, to the east of Mount Greenock Creek, is at present the most pro mising in the division. Seventeen tons of the stone have been crushed recently, which yielded 51 oz. of gold. Thickness of reef from 2J to 3 feet. The Sydenham Reef, convenient to the Carnubian, is looking very well ; 25 tons of the stone are ready for crushing, which is expected to yield 2 oz. per ton.

The ground is princi pally new, and the sinking differs in no respect from that of Rocky Flat. Convenient is ground that was worked by small parties of miners some eighteen months ago. While making the survey I was pointed out a claim from which it is said a 6 oz. nugget was obtained, and that the ground paid the party working it till, by driving further into the plains, in the direction of the lease, they found the bottom to dip suddenly, and water immediately appeared in a quantity sufficient to prevent a continuation of mining opera tions in that direction. Should the applicants No crushings worthy of note have taken place from the other reefs during the month. I forward a plan of the Amherst Flat dig gings connected with the cemetery, as shown on plan of last month. There are only afew isolated parties at work throughout the whole extent of the flat. This is in consequence of a large amount of water having lodged in the old ground, which will not be workable to advantage till the summer is more advanced."], [564, "368 MINING SURVEYORS REPORTS DECEMBER. Avoca Division. (R. English, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 A plan of the township, also one with sections of the workings, I shall furnish next month. The other portions of my division are almost denuded of their population, in consequence of this new discovery ; and I am of opinion that the Mountain Creek will become a very extensive and payable digging, not only in alluvial, but also in quartz. The character of the gold now being obtained in the drift is indicative of a recent and contiguous quartzose matrix. The sinking commenced at the base of the ranges, in ground from five to twelve feet deep, and in some places was found payable at that depth to the surface. A large area of ground has already been opened, extending over a number of hills slightly elevated, composed principally of coarse water-worn drift gravel. The whole of tbe ground yet worked is of a very patchy nature, no defined lead having been found, although several shafts on the opposite (and township) side of the creek have been sunk to depths varying from thirty to sixty feet. One hole, at a depth of forty-seven feet, obtained a 3 oz nugget and 2 oz. of finer gold from off the bottom of their shaft ; but the Christmas holidays of more than a week in this district have prevented the miners from ascertaining by this time whether this deep ground would or not (as many sup- pose it will) result in discovering a deep and payable lead. The yield of gold (per load) is quite in keeping with the character of the ground ; whilst iu some only a few dwts. is the result, others obtain from 1 oz. to 10 oz. Several parcels I have seen which has been the yield of from 2 to 3 oz. to the load, with from one to two feet thickness of wash-dirt. Other discoveries are reported to have been made within a few miles of these workings. A prospecting claim (three miles north) was granted yesterday by the warden.

There is nothing of importance to report either in alluvial or quartz mining with the exception that the prospects on Poverty Reef are brightening. The Prospector's and the two adjoining claims are working the reef at a depth of 265 feet ; it is from 16 to 18 feet thick, and is very rich.

You will perceive that the population, especially the mining population, have de creased since my last report. This in a great measure is attributable to the reports received from Mountain Creek rush. In calculating the number of square miles ou which mining operations are carried on, I beg to say that I can arrive only at an ap proximate, as in a new gold field, separated as the claims are at such a distance from each other, and in the midst of dense scrub, it would be impossible, unless at enormous Entire Popula- tion.

Jericho and Jordans. \u2014 There are seven reefs in this district at work, and one entirely abandoned. This latter had proved auri ferous at first. Although five of the3e reefs have different names, I believe they will all eventually be proved to be one. I hope very early to be able to forward you my map of the reefs of Inglewood, having already laid down eighty-one. to accomplish which I havo had to chain 17J miles, out of which 5J miles had to bo cut through dense mallee scrub. expense, to arrive at an exact computation of the area worked upon. Tbe miners on Daly's Lead, alluvial, have been compelled to cease working until such time as efficient machinery shall be put on the gjound to bale the extraordinary quantity of water which they have met with. I have, therefore, nothing new to report on this lead. The quartz mines of Inglewood are in a prosperous state, and every indication ap pears of this division proving a permanent and paying gold field. The want of machinery which has been hitherto felt, is in some degree remedied by the enterprise of several persons, who have erected efficient machinery, but much requires to be done to compete in that respect with some of our older gold fields. Inglewood. \u2014 The number of reefs on Ingle wood is now over one hundred, i.e. prospect ing claims having been granted by the wardens to that number on the applicants declaring that remunerative gold had been procured, and that such claim was not within 300 yards of any other claim. The yield of gold from the Columbian Reef still exceeds that of any other. The pro spectors are endeavoring to cut the lode at a lower level, having as yet only worked to the depth of between 45 and 50 feet. Generally the reefs in this part of ray division are remunerative, and seem to give satisfaction to the shareholders, although at times it is impossible to obtain the result of crushings from the several claims. Kingower. \u2014 A great many miners from this part have been attracted to Mountain Creek by the reports received from that place. The population, as will be seen by annexed table, is now only 1800, although. at one time since my last report, it contained a population of nearly 6000. The mining at Hall's rush, about one and a half miles from old Kingower, is altogether alluvial, the gold found being coarse and nuggety, and lying on decomposed granite, varying in depth from 20 to 80 feet. The only reef in this locality that is proving remunerative is the Union Reef. There aie two in work at Long Gully, but I have not been able to ascertain the result of their operations.

In answering (query 4) as requested by Mr. Humffray, I have enumerated those reefs as at work on which any party is engaged, and as idle those on which no one is at work \u2014 although having been worked for some little time, and in nearly every instance with a fair prospect, and then abandoned \u2014 and still not well or sufficiently tried. Likewise, in answer ing (query 5) as to the area of auriferous country (actually worked upon), I do nut Korong. \u2014 The quartz reefs here do not appear to be worked with anything like success, most of the miners being employed in alluvial sinking. The Woolshed Flat, situated about four and a half miles from Wedderburne, has, within the last three weeks, attracted about 600 miners ; and, although I can give no authentic account of the prospects of the place, I have heard of reports that it is likely to pay those at present there.

Siuce my last report the St. Arnaud Gold Mining Company have been steadily at work prospecting Sebastopol Hill, after having driven completely through the western reef at a depth of 100 feet, with a prospect of 3 dwt. to the ton ; they are now working on the northern end of the reef, and proving the opinion as advanced in my last as correct, viz., the deep shaft being too far south and the dip of gold being with strike of reef. They have laid bare the reef on the north end about 12 feet in depth and 24 feet in length, gradually increasing in thickness, and averaging about 4 feet ; from a trial of 8 tons taken indiscriminately they have realized the handsome return of 16 dwt. per ton. There is another kiln of about 24 tons already for crushing, and from its appearance, I should say it will average nearly an ounce per ton. Considering this company has every natural facility at hand, a splendid dam already partially full, the advantage of an unlimited supply of quartz (having a lease of 25 acres, and nearly all quartz), I hope before long to be able to report both rapid progress and splendid returns. On Wilson's Hill the St. Arnaud United Company have not been idle, tenders having been issued for supply of timber sufficient to sink main shaft 300 feet, as also tenders for excavation of reservoir 90x120 feet, and erection of dam, the spot selected being most advantageously chosen both for drainage and supply of water to machinery. Messrs. Edgar, Grierson, and Company have purchased an engine, &c, for draining and working No. 1 claim, south of the above company, situate on the Ballaarat and Chrysolite Reefs. Some parties have lately had a few tons of quartz crushed, yield 11 oz. per ton, from a new reef in a south-west direction, but as yet have declined giving me such information on which I could report more fully. At Hines's, about 22 miles west-south-west of here, the mining population is gradually increasing, and from the proximity of the rush to McKinnon's, will, I have no doubt, receive a share of its (McKinnon's) super abundant population. Messrs. Walker and Wrights splendid claim, plan and report of which 1 forwarded in my August report, has lately been jumped, tbe pretext being that the mass of leaders they are working is the main reef. As this case has created no little excitement here, and will be tried at the Court of Mines next week, I will refrain in the meanwhile from saying more on the subject. Messrs. Roberts and Bennett have lately discovered a new reef in the mallee, with every prospect of a good yield. The yield from Clarke and Company's Reef. also in the mallee, was 2 oz. per ton, 22 c. fine, The whole of the information contained herein is from personal observation, the popu lation returns being compiled from police report.

The number of distinct quartz reefs cannot be ascertained in consequence of their very partial development and the uncertainty at present existing respecting their real cha racter, some maintaining that each outcrop is a distinct reef, others supposing them con tinuations of continuous lodes; in either case the length of reef worked is comparatively very small, as unopened reefs are thickly studding this division, and taking the latter view by taking a cross section, we cut thirteen payable reefs, traceable six miles north and south, gives 78 miles of ascertained auriferous reef, of which only fourteen and one-third miles has been opened and not quite seven miles being at present held. New reefs.\u2014 A new reef has been opened dishful of quartz, and above 300 oz. realized from 6 tons raised.

Precious stones. \u2014 As paragraphs have ap peared in the local and Melbourne papers relative to a number of precious stones having been found in this division and sub mitted to a professional gentleman in Mel bourne, who pronounced them to be either aqua-marines or beryls, and by a subsequent report that native sapphires, opals and a diamond had been discovered in the same lo cality.

Kitto, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The machinery is as follows : \u2014 An area of about 12 square miles has been from time to time occupied for mining pur poses in this district. This area, however, is comprised within a larger area of about 90 square miles. There has been within the last month a 1 falling off in our Chinese population, owing to the scarcity of water in the drier parts of the district. It is likely, however, that by February numbers will return to work ground that has been too wet for mining during the spring and early summer months. The European population is stationary, and likely to remain so for some time to come. In fact, from the number of prospectors for quartz reefs, now at work, some good lines of reef will undoubtedly be discovered. In quartz mining generally in this district we are much brisker than we have been for many months past. ** The prospecting claim on the Liverpool Reef has been turning out remarkably well. Six tons of stone produced over 41 oz. to the ton, and 25 tons of refuse over 1 oz. to the ton, making a total of 274 oz. of gold from 31 tons of stuff, or an average of nearly 9 oz. to the ton. There are many parties working on this reef, but only one, except the prospectors, have struck gold, viz., No. 3 North ; these have not crushed any stone as yet, but some thing good is expected. On the other reefs in the district very little is being done. The mining companies still in existence appear to be making fair returns. The El Dorado is progressing, with gradu ally increasing weekly returns. In compliance with circular 60 | 3750 I have taken some trouble to gather the sta tistics required. Tbe number of inhabitants cannot possibly be correct, but they are as near as I can come at with the means at my disposal. Name of Reef.

The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Alliance Company is to be wound up. The Vaughan Company have declared their usual monthly dividend of \u00a35 10s. per share, or \u00a366 per centum per annum on the capital. This company certainly is a pattern that many others might profit by copying. There are many places in the district similar to the Vaughan mine that would evidently pay good dividends if worked after tbe same style. The Junction Crushing Company (private) consists of a party of ten; they have nearly finished the erection of the engine purchased of the Chapel Hill Mining Company. They are supposed to have good prospects before them, and are economising by doing nearly all the work in connection with the erection of the machinery themselves. The number of the mining population has not undergone any visible change during the month past; a few rushes have taken place, but the ground being, in all instances, in the immediate vicinity of old workings, and of only limited extent, no perceptible influx from other diggings has taken place. In steam machinery no actual increase has occurred, but a number of extensive claims in all parts of the division have been prospected, with a view of erecting efficient machinery on the ground, if favorable prospects are obtained; and I understand that in several instances parties are at present in treaty for engines. The Kangaroo Crushing Company (private) consists of ten working shareholders. They are busily engaged erecting the engine pur chased from the Old Pennyweight Hill Com pany. Alluvial mining. \u2014 Perhaps in no year since the discovery of our gold fields have the miners had such au abundant supply of water as in this. Many puddling machines that were idle last year, owing to a scarcity of that necessary element, have now several months' supply. Tunnellers are steadily at work in the bills in which the leads have been discovered. Mining matters throughout the division have during the last month been slowly but steadily progressing: some instances of more than ordinary good luck to individuals have oc curred, but generally speaking no decided improvement can be said to have taken place; but a considerable number of well organized companies of practical miners are prospecting both quartz and alluvial, and in most instances very favorable indications are met with. The number of parties prospecting, I expect, will shortly be augmented by the majority of our puddlers and sluicers, compelled by want of water to suspend their usual occupations, and I doubt very much that any gold field affords superior inducements for prospecting to Hep burn. A new field is likely to be opened in the vicinity of Holcombe. The prospecting tun nel in Heron's Hill is being pushed ahead with vigor; and another hill divided from Heron's by Boundary Creek, named Pyke's Hill, is also being prospected, so that in a month or two at furthest the result will be made known. I like the look of the ground. Hepburn Division. (Ambrose Johnson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Quartz mining.\u2014 This branch of industry has not during the last mouth experienced any marked change. In the Jim Crow portion of my division most of the known reefs are oc cupied, and in most instances turning out remunerative: the better knowledge of quartz workings, and consequent improved mode of working now acquired, together with the more efficient mode and consequent cheapness of crushing and amalgamating, enabling parties to clear a profit in working quartz that not very long ago was considered valueless.

From Melvin Reef I have not been able to learn the result of the crushings during the month. The party occupying the reef came to an arrangement with Messrs. Needham and Adams, who had a small portable engine idle on Doctor's Keef, and the machine was in con sequence removed to the reef in question. One of the original shareholders in the reef obtained the other week \u00a3bb for his share. Messrs. Little and Company, of Ballaarat, have taken up about 1000 feet of the reef north of Mr. Wilson, intending, if the reef proves payable, to erect their own machinery ; and, gold having been got in tbe reef on the very surface, it is only reasonable to expect that their enterprise will meet with success. On Sportsman's Reef (a southern continua tion of Parker's Specimen Reef,) another Ballaarat party is sinking a shaft, with a view of prospecting the reef at a depth. Some first-class stone was raised on this reef when first opened, and it is commonly believed that any quantity of quartz yielding from 7 dwt. upwards may on this reef be obtained. On Wombat Reef, the Cornish party are as busy as ever, and as usual getting well paid for their labor. The reef is only poor, but their systematic method of working, and having their own crushing plant, enable them to clear a dividend out of very poor quartz, and in working the reef on a large scale, patches of good stone are now and again come across. Two more claims are occupied on the same reef, but in both instances the holders are working the alluvial soil contiguous to the reef, but intend working the quartz in the dry season. A large number of abandoned reefs that lately were taken up are being prospected, and frjm what already is known of the respective reefs, the holders generally are very sanguine as to their ultimate success. On tbe range between Doctor's and Cobbler's Gully, a number of surface veins or leaders have lately been proved to contain gold, and I hope ere long to see a proper, well defined reef opened through this range. Yandoit has not, during the last month, presented quite as lively an aspect as usual, partly attributable to the want of crushing machinery, but also in a great measure owing to the majority of the miners prospecting for reefs residing in Ballaarat, or backed by parties working on that field having repaired thither to spend the holidays. Besides this, on all the different lines of reef a number of shafts have attained the water level, and these claims have, in most instances, been registered until a number of shafts adjoining, have met the same difficulty. During the first rush to Yandoit, or rather when the excitement was at its height, some three or four months ago, parties of twenty or thirty were formed (in most instances of miners iu Ballaarat), agreeing to pay share holders prospecting the reefs here at a certain rate of wages, until payaUe gold should be struck, in which case our bye-laws require that one man shall be employed for each 30 feet occupied by the company. The system was very good, but in only too many instances the representatives of such companies were not well enough acquainted with the nature of our reefs \u2014 their general dip, underlie, &c. \u2014 a knowledge that would greatly have assisted them in carrying out their object, and in prospecting for a quartz reef where, perhaps, for hundreds of yards no indications are visible on the surface, skill and discri mination are as much required as capital and labor. Now when, after three or four months' hard work, water or other natural difficulties The Welcome Reef Company is getting on remarkably well, their quartz averaging lately about ljoz. per ton. Work has, for the last fortnight, been suspended, on account of the holidays, 1 presume, but will probably Boon be resumed. The New Nuggety Reef, also in Connell's Gully, is still paying above ordinary divi dends, and I understand that the parties interested are about making arrangements for placing efficient baling machinery on the ground, several shafts having encountered water in such quantities as to be obliged temporarily to suspend operations. On Adams and Emeu Reefs the claims occupied are at present standing idle, under the privilege of registration, pending arrange ments for the formation of companies, erection of machinery, &c, being finally settled. Doctor's Reef, Doctor's Gully, for some time deserted, has lately been taken up by a Ballaarat party, who intend shortly to com mence operations. This reef was very rich when first opened about five years ago ; but when last worked, although the quality could not be complained of, the reef was too narrow to admit of being worked to advantage. On Parker's Specimen Reef (dry diggings), the Dry Diggings Company have just notified their intention, in accordance with the leasing regulations, to apply for a mining lease of the ground at present held by the company under miners' rights. It is a well known fact that thousands of pounds were realized off the claims held by the company, and only the amount of water encountered (not the poverty of the stone), has been the reason of the slow progress of the company lately. Mr. Wilson, occupying the adjoining claims north, having established a sawmill in con nection with the engine driving his crushing"], [575, "379 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS DECEMBER. are encountered, perhaps, in two or three adjoining shafts, and the parties working hers are at a loss how or what to do, another difficulty arises ; at least I know of cases where, under such circumstances, the contri buting shareholders in Ballaarat begin to get dilatory in paying up the calls, and the representatives here, thus thrown on their own resources, become more perplexed than ever. They know that, if ultimately their prospect should be attended with success, the company would be willing enough to indem nify them for their labor and in the mean time incurred expenses, but they also know that if they should be unsuccessful, it would be very improbable that they would receive any compensation ; and hence the spirit and energy necessary to ensure a satisfactory issue is either entirely lost, or very materially diminished. been crushed ; but the nature of the reef is very patchy, and nothing definite can there fore be said at present. However, there is no doubt that the reef is a southern continu ation of the Hamburg, and the claimholders are therefore very sanguine. On Bendigo and Butzback Reefs gold has also been obtained in several shafts, but not in payable quantities, and on Homeward bound Reef, where two shafts have been sinking, the northern claim, where some time ago a patch yielded 2 or 3 oz. per ton, has just applied for registration. On the Hamburg Reef, the only crushing I have heard of was a heap of seconds from, the prospecting claim. It, however, turned out better than expected, yielding about 8 oz. per ton. In this claim two fourth shares lately fetched \u00a31000 each. In the adjoining claim south, where gold was struck at a depth of 120 feet, the quartz being broken at present does not show quite as well as for merly, but the shareholders have every con fidence in obtaining as good stone as ever. The next claim south has been sunk to a depth of 150 feet, and driven about 60 feet, but no quartz been struck yet. The rest of the claims have all temporarily suspended operations, either for want of funds or excess of water. Thus the apparent dullness in mining matters in Yandoit is easily explained to my satisfaction, and I am still of opinion that Yandoit affords abundant inducement to legi timate enterprise ; but in tbe meantime the prosperity of the place cannot help to suffer, at least for a time. On Old German Reef I understand that a company is being formed for the better and more effectual working of Messrs. Hutton and Rankin's claims. A site for machinery, dam and tramway has already been granted, and the ground, in my opinion, presents a very good chance for the investment of capital necessary. The Goldsmiths' Quartz Mining Company, holding the ground north of the last named claims, have just applied for a mining lease of their ground, and I hope soon to see the company in active operation. On Pioneer Reef, the prospectors, Messrs. Steele and Company I believe have sold their ground to the Catherine Reef Company, of Bendigo, for \u00a3 , on condition that the quartz broken averages 6 oz. or upwards per ton. The majority of claims on this reef have for some time been at a standstill pending the completion of the Great Reef Company's engine, the amount of water being too heavy to be overcome by ordinary appliances; the said company's engine-shaft, for instance, making at a depth of 80 feet upwards of 60O gallons per hour. On Hoggett's Reef, Blind Gully, Messrs. Spinks and Company have hitherto been getting out very payable stone. This com pany has, off the reef left by the original pro pectors, crushed 5 oz. and upwards to the ton, and a number of claims have in conse quence been taken up both north and south ; but I have not heard of gold having been struck in any as yet. The Great Reef Company have also notified their intention of applying for a mining lease of their ground, viz., 940 feet on the Great Reef, and 480 feet on Pioneer Reef. Their plant (the defunct Yandoit Quartz Mining Company's) has been removed and refitted, and should make a trial start the third of January ; so the company may be expected to be in full operation in the early part of the new year, and the want of machinery in the vicinity of the reefs to some extent be alleviated. On Trogish Reef the gold was for some time lost in the prospecting claim, but has lately been stiuck again. The next party south is also getting gold-bearing stone, but have not yet had any crushed. All the rest of the claims are either abandoned or tem porarily registered. From Eichard's Reef a crushing from the prospecting claim averaged 17 dwt. per ton ; but even at that rate a tolerable profit can be realized. From Old Nuggety Reef, head of Nuggety Gully, lately opened, 1 have been shown some splendid specimens; but only a series of leaders have been opened, no properly de fined reef; but it is confidently expected that these leaders will ultimately join the reef. On the Glamorganshire Reef gold has been obtained in a number of claims ; as much as 3 or 4 oz per ton have in several instances"], [576, "380 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 DECEMBER. Malcolm's Reef, on private property, has, during the last month, been at a standstill; and 1 believe the original shareholders pur pose enlarging their company, with a view of procuring baling and crushing machinery. being systematically worked, drained, and faced out bodily, and some very fine specimens of the precious metal are every now and again turned up. The All Nations Company, on Blanket Flat, have withdrawn their application for a mining lease of 20 acres, and part of the grouud, about 10 acres, was immediately applied for by the adjoining lessees, Messrs. Graham and Munn, in connection with some other parties. The remaining 10 acres and the rest of the upper part of the flat is reported to have been rushed last week, but I have not yet been able to visit the spot. Years ago several shafts were sunk and gold obtained, but not in payable quautities ; but there is every indication to warrant the assumption that a lead through the flat exists. It is also reported that a patch of auriferous ground has been opened between Daylesford and the Mid dletou Creek, but was only found payable for puddling. Besides these reefs, a number of others are being prospected, but either not obtained any definite result, or else not undergone any notable change. Puddling and sluicing have, during De cember, remained much the same as usual. The creeks are still running a sufficient supply of water, a very unusual occurrence for this time of year, when in the preceding ones nine-tenths of the claims were at a standstill. Tbe average yield is not now, I am of opinion, quite as good as in the early part of the season ; but parties following these vocations generally having domesticated themselves and families in a spot convenient to their work, prefer, generally speaking, to work even for low wages, when steady re muneration can be obtained, to following the nomadic habits of tub and cradle men; aud although heavy finds are of very rare occur rence, still, on the whole, I believe I may with safety assert that more contentment and comfort will be found in the mining popula tion of Jim Crow than elsewhere. The lower part of Bald Hill Creek has been taken up by Chinese for sluicing, but I cannot obtain any reliable information as to the average produce. The parties having lately obtained grants of ground for sluicing below Shepherd's Flat, on the flats along Jim Crow Creek, have only recently commenced opera tions, and nothing definite can therefore be said as yet. In tunnelling the same activity as usual prevails, but no new ground has been opened, and no marked improvement has occurred. The tunnels started within the last couple of months into the basaltic hills below Shepherd's Flat are steadily driving ahead, but none have as yet got into the gutter. In Yandoit the New Nuggety Gully Com pany, and two other companies, occupying about 14 acres of ground in New Nuggety Gully, have been principally engaged cutting a tail drain, procuring timber, and making other preliminary arrangements for the more effectually working their respective claims, and I hope when these companies have got fairly to work to be able to report the discovery of some more of these heavy lumps for which the gully has hitherto been so famous. In most of the gullies a few old residents by their knowledge of the ground are earning a living, but no heavy finds have come to my know ledge. The only remarkable yields I have heard of have been in Mr. Morrison's paddock, where I am informed by the owner that one party of six obtained of six loads of stuff, as the result of one week's work, 78 oz., and another partv in the same paddock got 15 oz. of 10 loads of stuff. The old discovered leads through basaltic hills are all pretty well occupied, and fair wages may, as far as I can learn, be considered the average. In alluvial sinking a small rush to the upper part of Butterfly Gully has occurred ; the extent of ground was however of too limited extent to exert any influence on mining mat ters in general. Several of the claims however turned out very well ; the best find I believe was a nugget of some 35 oz., but the ground being very shallow is now nearly exhausted. This rush, however, has concentrated a num ber of tub and cradle men in a locality where for years very little attention has been be stowed, and these men knowing for a fact that the gold in that vicinity is very coarse and nuggety, and the runs very narrow, will probably exert more perseverance in pros pecting the surrounding gullies than generally was the case some three or four years back, when two or three holes sunk without obtain ing a prospect was deemed sufficient to con demn tbe whole gully as non-auriferous. The upper part of Keep it Dark and Boots Gully, old workings in the same locality, are now On the Lower Yandoit Flat Messrs. Harri son and Company's claim of 10 acres, lately granted, is showing a remarkably good pros pect. The shaft is down 27 feet, but the drift water is too heavy to admit of its being bot tomed ; but at that depth about 1 \\ to 2 feet of drift, expected to average 1 to ljt oz per load, has been gone through. The company I understand have sent to Ballaarat for a steam engine."], [577, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 DECEMBER. 381 westward of the Campaspe River, comprising an area of, perhaps, 100 square miles in a state of improvement and more or less in cul tivation there is probably a population of 4000 besides the miners, which will make a total of 5200.

This belt of auriferous country stretches about eight miles southward of the township of Taradale, and some six or seven miles eastward of it, but gold has been obtained beyond these limits; to the northward, along the valley of the Coliban River ; and at two places on the Campaspe River, north of Mr. Mitchell's station ; also, at a place in Clowes Forest, twenty miles southward of Taradale. There may be, then, eight or ten square miles occupied by the miners ; but an area of twenty square miles would not embrace the entire country over which they are scattered. I will subjoin a tabular statement of the alluvial workings which, with the one I have given of the quartz reefs, will show what ground is actually worked upon, and will, I hope, fully answer the question at issue. Statement of alluvial ground now being worked, and of that already worked : \u2014 always inserted the reputed number of miners located at that gold field. In reporting upon the operations carried on during the month of December, the chief occurrence has been the taking up of claims on an old abandoned reef called the Kangaroo, situate near Malmsbury. I mentioned in my last report that two leases had been applied for at this place, since which three other privileges have been taken up, under the bye-law regulations, so that 760 yards along tbe reef have been resumed. The Kangaroo Reef was known to yield gold, but in such small quantities, that the labor of obtaining it under the primitive mode practised, could not be profitable. One party are making preparations for the erection of a steam engine, and they also purpose constructing a tramway 500, yards long, to convey the quartz to the crushing machine. An application has been put in for a pros pectors privilege upon a new reef discovered near the Victoria, being only a quarter of a mile to the south west of it, and about a mile eastward of the township of Taradale. The party that applied last month for a lease of ten acres of old worked ground at Liberty Flat, for puddling by steam power, are busily engaged in moving their machinery from their old workings at Argus Flat, Forest Creek. The Barfold Reefs which were thought to be so promising, some few months back, have sadly fallen off, only two of the old reefs being worked, (the veins of quartz in all cases seem to run out as they penetrate downwards). Owing to the above circumstance the pro prietor of the crushing machine has moved it from there to Taradale, having taken up :. site on the Coliban River, close by the junction of the Back Creek, so as to be convenient to the Victoria Reefs. This movement will necessitate tbe cartage of quartz from the Barfold mines, a distance of six miles, to get them crushed. The last account of quartz crushings from tbe Barfold mines is of 94 J- tons, which yielded 82 oz. 8 dwt. of gold. The Victoria Reef is promising well, the last crushing from No. 1 claim was of 19J tons, which gave 119 oz. 4 dwt. The Ashtonia Reef. \u2014 Claim No. 1 gave from crushing of 23 tons, 33 oz. 2 dwt. ; Claim No. 2 gave from 29 tons, 29 oz. 17 dwt. of gold. Clowes Foiest gold field has been omitted in the foregoing statement, because it is ten miles distant from the nearest of the other auriferous localities, and I have not had an opportunity of visiting it, therefore I could not speak positively of what has been effected there, but in the population returns I have Whilst upon the subject of the reefs it may he well if I give a summary statement of the yield from them as far as I am able, which Localities.

Hughes's Reef which was first worked some five years ago, when it yielded in some in stances 40 oz. from the ton of quartz, pro duced at the last crushings only 5 dwt. per ton. The working shaft is 220 feet deep, and the reef is there 22 feet in thickness. This mine is in the hands of the Prince Albert Company, who have valuable machin ery upon the spot. But the entire works are lying idle, with the exception of crushing a few tons of quartz occasionally for other parties. This mine is secured to its owners by being registered, which permits the proprietors to relinquish work for three months. The Leviathan Reef has yielded gold on the surface, and is no doubt a paying reef, but being situate in low wet ground, on the bank of the Back Creek,there is mnchwater to con tendwi th. The association of miners forming the Leviathan Company have not any great amount of funds at their disposal, neither is the proprietor of the soil (this reef being on private property) in a position to expend a sufficient sum to develop its riches. But I doubt not but that at some not far distant day it will prove a rich mine. Castle Rock Reef has yielded but a few pen nyweights per ton of quartz, but a company having applied for it on lease, there is every probability that it will at least be well tested. One of tbe parties concerned assured me, that as high as two ounces of gold had been obtained from a ton ofthe stone. Belltopper Hill Reef. \u2014 Three claims have been for a longtime worked on this reef. One of the parties has a six horse-power engine there crushing the quartz. I fear it is of too small power to be effective. The miners tell me they get nearly an ounce of gold per ton. One of the parties here has temporarily re linquished his claim by placing it uuder re gistration a few days ago. Frenchman's Reef. \u2014 Two parties are work ing on this reef, and seem very satisfied, although they say that from five to seven pennyweights is the amount of gold that they only obtain from the ton. One of these parties has applied for a lease of four acres more ground, adjoining his old working, which shows very fully his opinion of the reef. He has a ten horse-power steam engine on the spot, Kangaroo Reef. \u2014 This reef was till lately entirely abandoned ; the miners last working on it told me that they could not get but three pennyweights from a ton, but that not long previously they had obtained as much as 23 pennyweights, but their means were too small to enable them to pursue the research further; their shaft was 90 feet in depth.

Two leases and three extra privileges have now been taken up on this reef, as I stated before in this report. Jefferson's Reef, situate on private property, three miles south of Malmsbury, and near the Coliban River, has long been worked seem ingly with satisfaction. Foster's Reef, Barfold. \u2014 This makes the last of my catalogue of auriferous reefs. 'I have seen quartz from this reef which abun dantly shows the precious metal. This is a new reef, and as yet there has not been any quartz crushed. The alluvial workings have for these last two months been extremely devoid of in terest. The alluvial miners are much scat tered, and I think somewhat decreased in numbers, particularly so are the Chinese. Sluicing in the few instances in which it is being pursued here, seems to be vigorously carried on ; that is, in four cases on the Coliban River, near Taradale, and two on the Back Creek. The total population, including all classes, living on the gold fields within this division, is 1301, as nearly as I can ascertain. The number of quartz reefs, known to be more or less auriferous, in this division is 39, and the aggregate area of the several patches of auriferous ground, both quartz and alluvial, is about 43 square miles as nearly as I can estimate. The greater part of this ground has been more or less worked upon, and lies in patches widely apart in most cases. I have the honor to inform you that during the month of December mining affairs have been rather improving than otherwise in this division, and that there has been a gradual and very considerable increase in the number of miners during the past month, owing to the return here of nearly all the miners that left this division for the Baw-baw and other gold fields. With respect to quartz mining, I am glad to observe that the number of persons en gaged in that pursuit has increased to some extent since my last report, and is likely to increase still further now that there are greater facilities for quartz crushing than heretofore. There are now four machines in this division that will crush for the public, namely, one at Salter's rush near the Yow yow, one at Queenstown and two at Ander son's Creek, if Mr. Wilkinson's machine can be taken into account ; besides these machines there are two others, that is, a horse machina in Specimen Gully at Anderson's Creek, and a small machine, driven by water-power, at Badger Point on the Caledonia gold field ; this last mentioned machine is idle at present in order to undergo some alterations. The price of crushing at the different mills is as follows : at Queenstown tbe price is 30s. per ton, at Salter's rush, 27s. 6d.; at Mr. Cap per's machine, 20s. ; and Mr. Wilkinson wants 50s. per ton for treating quartz with his ma chinery and process. I am not however pre pared to state that the results from Mr. Wil kinson's machine are at all satisfactory, not withstanding the very high price that he wishes to levy. His crushing operations are therefore confined to the quartz raised by his own party at the Third Hill Reef, Anderson's Creek. Other parties are also sluicing at places further down the Coliban, and one or more parties too on the Campaspe River, but shave not been able to visit those parts lately. The statistical returns which I have fur nished with this report lessen the necessity of any lengthy remarks on particular places, as it shows in detail what is doing as well as what localities are being worked. St. Anorew's Division. (James Murphy, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The yield of gold from all the quartz raised in the division I have been unable to ascertain ; but I know that the lowest was 2\\ oz. per ton from Allen's Reef, Yow-yow, and that the highest was 14Joz. per ton from Oram's Reef. Seeing that there are thirty-nine auriferous quartz reefs (and many of them totally aban doned) in this division, it is astonishing that the unemployed miners and others do not avail themselves of the opportunity of earn ing,atleast, a comfortable livelihood, now that there are ample means here of extracting gold. esdC Europeans.

The Smyth's Creek Mining Company have extensive opera tions going on, both at One Tree Hill and at the Yow-yow. They have discontinued their tunnelling operations at One Tree Hill, and are working their ground there from shafts ; but their tunnel at the Yow-yow is being driven with great rapidity, andis now comple ted to the length of 600 feet through various kinds of rock (to be shown hereafter in sec tion when the tunnel is completed), and they are also working a vein from the surface in this locality. hardships I ever had to encounter. From the denseness and height of the scrub, and the all but impossibility of finding the spur lead ing to Pheasant Creek, I was obliged to turn back : also, our provisions were so nearly exhausted that we were for two days upon short allowance, and our clothes literally worn to shreds. There is no doubt whatever that the Baw baw gold field is on the La Trobe watershed, and in the Beechworth district, from the fact of Mount Baw-baw bearing about 15\u00b0 south of east, and apparently upon a spur south of the Dividing Range, and not forming a part of it, as is supposed. Ararat Division. (John Usher, jun., Mining Surveyor.) Statistics of population, machinery, &e. : \u2014 The Yow-yow Hill Mining Company is a small local company, composed of miners and others, under local management; but having no working shareholders, and is found to work steadily and well in consequence. They have driven a tunnel from the north east side of the hill to a distance of 106 feet, which brings them within 4 feet of the old workings, $% feet below the summit level of the hill, and with the certainty of obtaining payable quartz The One Tree Hill Mining Company has made an application some two months ago for a lease of certain quartz ground on One Tree Hill, which has not been yet granted, so far as I am aware. They are not carrying on any mining operations, in consequence of their arrangements having been disturbed by recent litigation about some of tbe ground in question. In alluvial mining there is nothing to report out of the ordinary state of things in this branch of mining, except that in Fern Tree Gully, at One Tree Hill, some of the miners are doing exceedingly well ; but to what extent it is all but impossible for me to ascertain, as the miners there, with a few exceptions, seem rather unwilling to let their success be known ; however, I know that out of one claim (and not the best one either) 22 lb. weight of gold have been taken out of 60 feet of ground within little more than three months. Some small companies are spoken of as being about to be formed near Anderson's Creek ; and puddling machines are about to be erected in some of the gullies immediately tributary to the Yarra near that locality. I hereby forward a sketch of the Dividing Range between the La Trobe and the Yarra watersheds, forming a part of the boundary between the Castlemaine and Beechworth mining districts, aud obtained by me after nine days in those ranges of the severest Divisions.

Pleasant Creek Division. Alluvial mining. \u2014 Four Posts Lead. \u2014 Some very rich ground is now being worked on this lead, and about one hundred claims are yielding good dividends. The depth of sinking is 80 feet, and the gold is deposited principally in cement, which rests on the pipeclay. Some very rich yields have also been realized, varying from 10 to 15 oz. to the ton, and patches have been obtained where the yield has considerably exceeded that proportion. Sinking is being proceeded with vigorously in the vicinity of this rich ground, but it has not yet been proved to extend far beyond old ground that was worked two years ago. The cement and wash-dirt requires crushing, and the mills in the neighborhood are consequently kept in full work, and are likely to be so for a con siderable time.

Annexed I have the honor to hand you statistics of population, machinery, &c, including additional information as instructed in your circular letter 60 | 3725 ; which have been carefully taken by persons I have had specially employed for the purpose, and whom I have every reason to believe have given the matter their careful attention. Accompanying this, I forward Sheet No. 3, of the Mining Survey of this district. During the month there has not been much alteration in mining matters, except that many miners have left for the neighboring rush at McKinnon's, in the Maryborough district. I beg to hand the following report of the various divisions of this district. Quartz reefs. \u2014 Upwards of 700 feet of the Cross Reef (one of the richest) is now standing for want of powerful pumping machinery, and the only obstacle apparent, is the difficulty experienced by capitalists of arranging with claimholders, each one attaching such great value to his interest. I have no hesitation in saying that with adequate pumping machinery the returns would be quite doubled. Several claims have been taken up during the past fortnight on a reef called the Brummagem Keef, situated about a mile eastward of the Hampshire. The rush has been occasioned in consequence of the prospecting party having lately struck payable stone at a depth of 20 feet. Some refuse stone was lately crushed from this claim which yielded over 8 dwt. to the ton. No stone has been crushed since the last golden stone was struck, but increased con fidence is felt in this reef from the appear ance of the same. Raglan Division. This gold field has yielded improved returns of late, owing to the development of its wet leads at McCook's, Ding Dong Gullies, and the main flat. Steam engines are at work on the verge of the township, the main lead heading for Willobie street. There seems to be every probability of large acces sions of new machinery during the next month. The dry sinkings have been drained of their population by a neighboring attraction to the Mountain Creek gold field. Quartz Reefs. \u2014 There are at present four quartz reefs being prospected, but no greater yield thau 18 dwt. of gold to 2^ tons of quartz has, up to the present time been obtained. Judging from the appearance of the ranges I have not the slightest doubt that by a proper search a large number of payable quartz reefs might be found.
