The benefits to be derived from historical records of noble achievements whether physical or moral are universally acknowledged. The ambition of the student, the warrior, or the statesman is stimulated by the accounts transmitted in this manner ; and the Patriotic of every age and nation have heard with pride the heroic deeds of their countrymen recounted, whether it be done by the faithful pen of the impar tial historian, or recorded in the page of Historical Romance. It is with the desire of commemorating some of the most remarkable exploits of our gallant seaman that the following plain and unvarnished de scription of the Naval Battles fought by them since the establishment of the American Navy is offered to the public; believing it will be useful to the whole American People and especially to the rising genera tion, prompting them to emulate the Heroic daring, and that high minded self respect which has uniform ly distinguished the American Commander. No one can read these pages without being filled with admi ration at the vast majority of victories which have crowned the efforts of our Gallant Navy. Indeed:"], [14, "8 NAVAL BATTLES. during the continuance of the late war with Great Britain there are but two instances of the loss of an American Ship where the forces were nearly equal, viz. \u2014 the Chesapeake and the Argus ; and we cer tainly cannot consider the former as having been of equal force with the Shannon, although the number of guns were so nearly equal, (the Shannon having in all 53 guns and the Chesapeake 49) on account of the difference -in the crews, the Shannon having been at sea long enough to discipline hers completely, while the crew of the Chesapeake were scarcely out of port. Nor is the meed of praise due to our gallant Tars for bravery in action alone, for we have abun dant evidence in the following pages of very superior skill in Naval Tactics and Seamanship, as well as in battle. There is not probably on the pages of histo ry a more brilliant illustration of these qualities than in the escape of the Constitution from the British Fleet in July, 1812. In every naval engagement seamen alone can tell how much depends upon* skill and celerity in managing the ship.

Navy than any other publication, and the engravings are done in a style of elegance which does honor to the artists who executed them. In the revolutionary war, which gave indepen dence and character to the United States of Ame rica, several armed vessels were in commission, and performed exploits, that confer immortality on the names of Barby, Manly, Jones, and others. Dur ing the latter years of the contest, from the want of finances, the depreciation of paper currency, and, perhaps, still more, from the alliance with France supplying a naval force, little was done to augment, or even to maintain, that of our own nation ; and, shortly after the close of the war, the few ships, that had constituted the navy, were sold by order of Congress. The depredations committed on our commerce in the Mediterranean, by the piratical corsairs of the Barbary powers, induced Congress, in 1794, to undertake the formation of a naval force for its protection. Four ships, of forty-four guns each, and two of thirty -six, were ordered to be built. \u2014 The act authorizing the construction of these ships, passed the twenty-seventh day of Maboh, which may be considered as the day that gave existence to the navy of the United States. 2"], [16, "10 naval battles. The creation and establishment of a permanent and efficient naval force, for the protection of commerce and the defence of the seacoast in case of war, had always been advocated by Mr. John Adams ; and during the term of his presidency, from March, 1797, to March, 1801, the object was pursued with great zeal and energy. To no individual is the nation more indebted, than to Mr. Adams ; and posterity will hail him as the father of the American navy. In 1798, there were in service twenty vessels ; in 1799, upwards of thirty. A law was passed, direct ing the building of six seventy-four gun ships, which, however, was never carried into effect. In 1801, the navy consisted of the following ships : United States 44 guns President 44 Constitution 44 Philadelphia 44 Chesapeake 36 Constellation 36 Congress 36 New-York 36 Boston 32 Essex 32 Adams 32 John Adams 32 General Greene 32 All the other public vessels were ordered by Con gress to be sold, and the building of those authorized was suspended."], [17, "11 NAVAL BATTLES. CAPTAIN THOMAS TRUXTON. Was one of the first six captains appointed by the President, at the organization of the naval establish ment, in 1794. He was directed to superintend the building of the Constellation, of 36 guns, at Balti more, and to take the command of her when equipped The commerce of the United States having suf fered much from the ravages of the French, both in national vessels and privateers, Captain Truxton was sent with a squadron to the West Indies for its pro tection. On the ninth of February, 1799, at noon, the is land of Nevis bearing w. s. w. five leagues distant, the Constellation being then alone, a large ship was discovered to the southward, which proved to be the French frigate Insurgente, of forty guns and four hundred and seventeen men. Commodore Truxton bore down upon her, and, at a quarter past three, ranging along side, poured a broadside into her, which was immediately returned. After a warm action of an hour and a quarter, the French ship struck : twenty-nine of her crew were killed, and forty-four wounded. The Constellation had only one man kill \u2022 ed, and two wounded. On the first of February, 1 800, the Constellation being alone in the road of Basseterre, at half past seven a. m. Guadaloupe bearing eastward, about five leagues distant, a sail was discovered, which, on ap-"], [18, "12 NAVAL BATTLES. proaching, commodore Truxton ascertained to be a heavy French frigate, of fifty-four guns. He im mediately prepared his ship for action. He con tinued the chase till one the next day, when a fresh wind enabled him to gain upon her. At eight in the evening, having got within hail, he hoisted his en sign ; had all the candles in the battle lanterns light ed ; and was in the lee gang way, ready to speak to the French ship, when she commenced a fire from her stern and quarter guns at the rigging of the Constel lation. Having repeated the orders he had before given, commodore Truxton, in a few moments gain ed a position on the weather of the French ship, which enabled him effectually to return her broad side. After a close and severe action of about four hours, the fire of the French ship was completely silenced, and she sheered off, at the moment when Truxton considered her as his prize, and had ordered the tattered sails of the Constellation to be trimmed. It was then perceived that the main-mast was totally unsupported by rigging, every shroud having been shot away. All efforts to support the mast were use less ; it went over the side in a few minutes, carrying all the top-men with it.* Before the ship could be cleared of the shattered fragments, which was ac complished in about an hour, the French ship had * James Jarvis, of New-York, a midshipman, commanded the main-top. He was apprized of his danger by a seaman, but bad so high an opinion of the duty of an officer, that he replied, \" If the mast goes, we must go with it.\" This soon happened, and only one of the men was saved."], [19, "13 NAVAL BATTLES. effected her escape. Her disappearance was so sud den, that, the people on board the Constellation sup posed she had sunk. She arrived at Curracoa, five days after the engagement, so shattered, that all her crew were continually employed at the pumps to keep her from sinking. She had one hundred and sixty men killed and wounded. Her captain stated that he had twice struck his colours ; but, owing to the darkness, it was not perceived on board the Constel lation. Believing it was the determination of the American captain to sink him, he renewed the en gagement from necessity. The Constellation had thirty-nine men killed and wounded. The French frigate was the Vengeance. CAPTAIN LITTLE\u2014 FRIGATE BOSTON. The United States frigate Boston, commanded by oaptain Little, being on a cruise, to protect the American commerce in the West Indies, in latitude 22, 50, longitude 51, captured, on the 12th of Octo ber, 1 800, after an action of an hour and forty min utes, the French national corvette Le Berceau. The Boston mounted twenty-four 12, and eight 9 poun ders, and had two hundred and thirty men, of whom six were killed, and eight wounded. Le Berceau was commanded by captain Senes, had twenty-two 9, and two 12 pounders, on one deck, and two hun-"], [20, "14 NAVAL BATTLES. dred and thirty men, She lost all her masts, and was otherwise much disabled. She had been out from Cayenne twenty-five days, during which she had plundered two American vessels and made prize of one. On a former cruise she had captured seve ral American vessels. A variety of circumstances conspired to render this capture of much importance. Le Berceau was considered one of the fastest sailing corvettes in the French navy ; she served as a look out vessel to the French fleet for eighteen months, had frequently been chased by British cruisers,' but never overtaken ; and had been very successful in capturing British, American, and Portuguese vessels ; and was bound on this cruise to intercept the Ameri can Indiamen, and South American ships. Captain Senes had been post captain in the French navy for many years ; was a midshipman in count D'Estaing's fleet in the revolutionary war ; and was esteemed a brave and intelligent officer. Le Berceau lost in the engagement her first lieutenant, master, boat swain, master-gunner, and pilot, besides a number of seamen. Captain Senes, and a commissioner, who was in Le Berceau, after being in the Boston fifteen days, were, at their request, permitted to go to Bar badoes, on their parole. The Boston expended upwards of 27 cwt. of pow der, upwards of 1500 round shot, besides double that number of chain, double-headed, and grape, during the action. Captain Little arrived, with his prize, at Boston, the 14th of November."], [21, "15 NAVAL BATTLES. CAPTAIN STERRETT. In the month of August, 1801, Captain Sterrett, commander of the United States schooner Enter prize, of twelve guns, and ninety men, fell in, off Malta, with a Tripolitan cruiser of fourteen guns and eighty-five men. A desperate conflict ensued, and had continued for nearly two hours, when the Tri politan hauled down her colours. The crew of the Enterprize left their guns, and gave three cheers for the victory. Upon this, the cruiser poured a broadside into the Enterpize, hoisted her colours, and renew ed the action with redoubled vigour. Her crew, brandishing their sabres, continually attempted to board. They were again overcome by the skilful crew of the Enterprize, and struck a second time. Captain Sterrett then ordered the cruiser under his quarter, and kept his men at the guns. But the Tripo litan had no sooner come to the position she was order ed, than she renewed the action the third time, by pouring a broadside into the Enterprize. The Tripo litans hoisted their bloody flag, and attempted to board. The indignant cry of \" Fight on, and sink the per fidious villains to the bottom,\" was now heard from every part of the American schooner. Every effort was made by Captain Sterrett to ensure a complete victory. His superior skill in the management of his vessel enabled him to rake the corsair, fore and aft. A number of shot between wind and water, opened her sides for the sea to pour in. Fifty of her men were killed and wounded. Her treacherous"], [22, "16 NAVAL BATTLES. commander, perceiving the destruction of his vessel and crew inevitable, implored for quarters. Bending in a supplicating posture over the waste of his ves sel, he threw his colours into the sea, to convince the American captain that he would no more attempt to resist. Captain Sterrett, actuated by the sentiment of true bravery, stopped the effusion of blood, though the treacherous conduct of the Tripolitans merited no mercy. His instructions not permitting him to make a prize of the cruiser, he ordered her crew to throw overboard all their guns, swords, pistols, ammunition, &c. and then to go and tell their countrymen the treat ment they might expect from a nation, determined to pay tribute only in powder and ball. The Enterprize, in this engagement of three hours, did not lose a man. Captain Sterrett, after paying every attention to the wounded Tripolitans, ordered the cruiser to be dismantled. Her masts were cut down. A spar was raised, to which was hung a tat tered sail, as a flag. In this condition she was sent to Tripoli. On her arrival there, the indignation, excited by her defeat, was so great, that the bashaw ordered the wounded captain to be mounted on a jack-ass, and paraded through the streets as an ob ject of public scorn ; and then to receive five hun dred bastinadoes. The Tripolitans were so terrified at this event, that the sailors abandoned the cruisers then fitting out. Not a man could be procured to navigate them.* * History of the war between the United States and Tripoli p. 91."], [23, "17 NAVAL BATTLES. SCHOONER EXPERIMENT.\u2014 LIEUT. STEWART. In July, 1800, lieutenant Charles Stewart was ap pointed to the command of the Experiment, of twelve guns, and ordered to cruise in the West Indies. He arrived on that station the first of September, and the same night fell in with the French schooner Deux Amis, of eight guns, which he engaged and captur ed, without any loss, after an action of ten minutes. Soon after, while cruising near the island of Bar buda, he discovered a brig of war, and a three-masted schooner, standing for the Experiment, under a press of sail, and displaying English colours. The Exper iment was hove to, and the British signal of the day was made, which not being answered by the strange vessels by the time they were within gun-shot, that signal was hauled down, and the Experiment stood away with all sail set. A chase was now commenced by the enemy, and continued for about two hours ; when finding they were outsailed by the Experiment, they relinquished the pursuit, and bore away under easy sail, firing a gun to windward, and hoisting French colours. Lieutenant Stewart now man\u0153uvred his schooner so as to bring her in the enemy's wake to windward, when a chase was made on his part, which continued the whole day before the wind, each vessel crowding all her canvass. At eight o'clock 3"], [24, "18 NAVAL BATTLES. at night, the Experiment closed with the three-mast ed schooner, which was the sternmost of the hostile vessels; and having taken a position on her lar- board-quarter, opened a fire upon her from the great guns and small arms, which in about five minutes, compelled her to strike. She was immediately ta- ken possession of, and proved to be the French schooner of war Diana, of fourteen guns and sixty- five men, commanded by M. Peraudeau, lieutenant de Vaisseau. The detention occasioned by removing the prisoners, enabled the brig of war to escape. She mounted, as was afterwards learned, eighteen guns, and had a crew of one hundred and twenty men. The Experiment proceeded to St. Christo pher's Avith her prize. On the 14th of December, she fell in with the privateer Flambeau, of sixteen guns and ninety men, with a prize brig, steering for Marigalante. The breeze being light and the enemy to windward, it was late in the afternoon before there was any pros- pect of closing with him. Notwithstanding all the exertions of the Experiment, the Flambeau escaped in shore ; but her prize was retaken. This vessel proved to be the Zebra of and from Baltimore, laden with flour. During the remainder of this cruise, the Experiment recaptured several American vessels sometimes as many as two or three in a day, and thus rescued American property to a considerable amount."], [25, "19 NAVAL BATTLES. OPERATIONS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. As every incident and anecdote connected with the Tripolitan war has become extremely interest ing to the publick, we trust that the following cir cumstantial, though very imperfect, nabrative of the operations of the squadron under Commodobe Pbeble, will be read with satisfaction. The Tripolitan cruisers continuing to harass the vessels of the United States, Congress determined, in 1803, to act with greater vigour against them, and to fit out a fleet that should not only repel their unprovoked aggression, but also chastise their in solence. The squadron consisted of the Constitu tion, 44 guns ; the Philadelphia, 44 ; the Argus, 18; the Syren, 16; the Nautilus, 16; the Vixen, 16; and the Enterprize, 14. Commodore Preble was appointed to the command of this squadron, in May, 1803. On the thirteenth of August, commodore Preble sailed in the Constitution for the Mediterranean. On his passage he brought to a Moorish frigate, which he suspected had been authorized to cruise against American vessels ; but her papers not sup porting such a suspicion, he dismissed her. When he arrived at Gibraltar, he found that our affairs with Morocco had assumed a very disagreeable aspect. Captain William Bainbridge, commanding the fri gate Philadelphia, had sailed in July ; and, on the"], [26, "20 naval battles. twenty-sixth of August, had captured the Moorish ship Mirboha, of twenty-two guns, and one hundred and ten men. An order to cruise for American ves sels was discovered among her papers. There was no signature to this order. The captain said it was delivered to him sealed, by the Moorish governour of Tangiers, who ordered him not to open it until at sea. By the authority of this order he had captured the American brig Celia, then in company. In May, captain Rodgers had detained a vessel, under Moor ish colours, attempting to enter Tripoli, then actually blockaded by him. On board of her were four guns, and other contraband articles. The emperour denied having authorized the latter ; and the governour of Tangiers disavowed having given any orders to cruise for Americans to the former. Commodore Preble, the day after his arrival, wrote to the American con sul at Tangiers, that peace with the emperour of Morocco was desirable ; that since he disavowed the acts of hostility, committed by his subjects, he should punish as pirates all Moorish cruisers attempting to capture American vessels.* Commodore Rodgers, who, with the New York and John Adams, frigates, was under orders to re turn to the United States, consented to remain a feAv days on the station, and to proceed with commodore Preble to Tangier bay, to effect an adjustment of existing differences. On the seventeenth of August, commodore Preble appeared in Tangier bay, and hoisted a white flag * Port Folio, vol. iii. p. 361."], [27, "21 NAVAL BATTLES. in token of peace. The American consul was not permitted to go on board. Two sentinels were placed at his door. About this time another act of hostility was com mitted at Mogadbre. It was an order given to detain all American vessels. The brig Hannah, of Salem, Avas actually seized. This determined the commddore to take a more decided course. He ordered his squadron to bring in all Moorish vessels for examination. He despatch ed vessels to cruise off Mogadore, Salee, Zarach and Tetuan, while he himself entered the bay of Tangiers from time to time. The Philadelphia and Vixen Avere ordered to lie before Tripoli. On the 5th of October, when the emperour of Mo rocco was expected at Tangiers, commodore Preble anchored the Constitution and Nautilus in the bay, within half a mile of the circular battery. In the afternoon of the 6th, he Avas joined by the frigates New York and John Adams. The ships were con stantly kept clear for action, and the men night and day at their quarters. The emperour arrived on the 6th, with a great body of troops, Avho encamped on the beach opposite the American squadron. The commodore saluted the emperour with tAventy-one guns, which were retured by an equal number from the fort. A present of bullocks, sheep, and foAvls, \u25a0was sent to the American squadron, as- a token of the emperour's good will. On the 8th, the emperour, attended by a body of troops, came to the beach' for"], [28, "22 NAVAL BATTLES. the purpose of viewing the American squadron. The Constitution again complimented him with twenty one guns, with which he was much gratified. The next day the American consul informed the commodore that the emperour had given orders for the American brig, detained at Mogadore, to be re leased ; and that he would give audience to the American commodore and consul on the following Monday. On the day appointed, the commodore, accompa nied by four persons, went on shore. He ordered the officer, commanding the squadron during his ab sence, to fire upon the town, if he should be forci bly detained ; and not to enter into any treaty for his release, nor be influenced by any considerations for his personal safety. When arrived at the castle, they were conducted through a double file of soldiers to the emperour. The commodore, on entering, was requested to put away his side arms ; with this he declined complying ; and was permitted to retain them. The emperour expressed much sorrow and regret that any difference had arisen ; for it was his desire to be at peace with the United States. He denied having given any hostile orders ; promised to restore all American vessels and property, detained by the authority of any of his governours ; and re newed and confirmed the treaty made with the Uni ted States, in 1786. The commodore and consul, on the part of the United States, promised that the ves sels and property belonging to the emperour, should"], [29, "23 NAVAL BATTLES. be restored ; and the orders for capturing them re voked. Commodore Preble was now at liberty to direct his whole attention to Tripoli. The season Avas, hoAvever, too far advanced for active operations. . On the 31st of October, the Philadelphia, being, at nine o'clock in the morning, about five leagues to the Avestward of Tripoli, discovered a sail in shore, standing before the wind to the eastward. The Philadelphia immediately gave chase. The sail hoisted Tripolitan colours, and continued her course near the shore. The Philadelphia opened a fire upon her, and continued it, till half past eleven ; when, being in seven fathoms Avater, and finding her fire could not prevent the vessel entering Tripoli, she gave up the pursuit. In beating off, she ran on a rock, not laid doAvn in any chart, distant four and a half miles from the town. A boat was immediately lowered to sound. The greatest depth of water was found to be astern. In order to back her off, all sails were then laid aback ; the top-gallant-sails loosened ; three anchors thrown away from the boAvs ; the water in the hold started; and all the guns thrdwn over board, excepting a few abaft to defend the ship against the attacks of the Tripolitan gun-boats, then firing at her. All this, however, proved ineffectual; as did also the attempt to lighten her forward by cut ting away her foremast. The Philadelphia had al ready withstood the attack of the numerous gun-boats for four hours, Avhen a large reinforcement coming out of Tripoli, and being herself deprived of every"], [30, "24 NAVAL BATTLES. means of resistance, and defence, she Avas forced to strike, about sunset. The Tripolitans immediately took possession of her, and made prisoners of the officers and men, in number three hundred. Forty eight hours afterwards, the Avind blowing in shore, the Tripolitans got the frigate off, and towed her into the harbour. On the 14th of December, commodore Preble sailed from Malta, in company with the Enterprize, commanded by lieutenant Stephen Decatur. On the 23d, the latter captured a ketch in sight of Tripoli ; which place she had left the preceding night, bound to Bengaza. She was under Turkish colours, and was navigated by Turks and Greeks. On board of her were tAvo Tripolitan officers of dis tinction, a number of Tripolitan soldiers, and about forty blacks belonging to the bashaAV and his sub jects. The commodore had at first determined to release the vessel and men claimed by the Turkish captain : and only detain the Tripolitans, about sixty in number, as prisoners. But before this de termination could be put in execution, he ascertain ed, that this same captain had been very active in assisting to take the Philadelphia. He had, on that occasion, received on board his vessel one hundred armed Tripolitans ; had changed his own colours for that of the enemy; had attacked the frigate; and, when she was boarded, had plundered the offi cers. This determined the commodore to retain the vessel. As she was in no condition to be sent to the United States, he forwarded her papers to"], [31, "25 NAVAL BATTLES. government. Soon after he had her appraised ; and took her into the service as the ketch Intrepid. When lieutenant Decatur Avas informed of the loss of the Philadelphia, he immediately formed a plan of recapturing and destroying her, which he proposed to commodore Preble. At first the commodore thought the projected enterprise too hazardous ; but at length granted his consent. Lieutenant Decatur then selected for the enterprise the ketch Intrepid, lately captured by him. This vessel he manned Avith seventy volunteers, chiefly of his own creAV ; and on the third of February sailed from Syracuse, accompa nied by the brig Siren, lieutenant SteAvart. The Siren was to aid the boats ; and, in case it should be deemed expedient to use the Intrepid as a fire ship, to receive her creAV. After a tempestuous passage of fifteen days, the two vessels arrived off the harbour of Tripoli, towards the close of day. It was determined that at ten o'clock in the evening the Intrepid should enter the harbour, accompanied by the boats of the Siren. But a change of Avind had separated the two vessels six or eight miles. As delay might prove fatal, lieu tenant Decatur entered the harbour alone about eight o'clock. The Philadelphia lay within half gun sho of the Bashaw's castle and principal battery. On her starboard quarter lay two Tripolitan cruisers Avith in two cables length; and on the starboard bow a number of gun-boats Avithin half gun-shot. All her guns were mounted and loaded. Three hours werp, in consequence of the lightness of the wind, con- 4"], [32, "26 NAVAL BATTLES. sumed in passing three miles, when, being within two hundred yards of the Philadelphia, they were hailed from her, and ordered to anchor on peril of be ing fired into. The pilot on board the Intrepid wa? ordered to reply, that all their anchors were lost. The Americans had advanced within fifty yards of the frigate, when the wind died away into a calm. Lieutenant Decatur ordered a rope to be taken out and fastened to the fore chains of the frigate, which was done, and the Intrepid was Avarped along side. It was not till then the Tripolitans suspected them to be an enemy ; and their confusion in consequence was great. As soon as the vessels was sufficiently near, lieutenant Decatur sprang on board the frigate, and Avas followed by midshipman Morris.* It was a minute before the remainder of the crew succeeded in mounting after them. But the Turks, crowded together on the quarter deck, were in too great con sternation to take advantage of this delay. As soon as a sufficient number of Americans gained the deck they rushed upon the Tripolitans ; who Avere soon overpoAvered ; and about twenty of them were kill ed. After taking possession of the ship, a firing com menced from the Tripolitan batteries and castle, and from two corsairs near the frigate ; a number of laun ches were also seen roAving about in the harbour ; whereupon lieutenant Decatur resolved to remain in the frigate, for there he Avould be enabled to make the best defence. But perceiving that the launches kept at a distance, he ordered the frigate to be set on fire, * Now Captain Morris."], [33, "NAVAL BATTLES. 27 Avhich was immediately done, and so effectually, that Avith difficulty was the Intrepid preserved. A favour able breeze at this moment sprung up, which soon carried them out of the harbour. None of the Amer icans were killed, and only four Avounded. For this heroick achievement lieutenant Decatur was promot ed to the rank of post captain. His commission was dated on the day he destroyed the Philadelphia. After the destruction of the Philadelphia frigate, commodore Preble was, during the spring and early part of the summer, employed in keeping up the blockade of the harbour of Tripoli, in preparing for an attack upon the town, and in cruising. A prize that had been taken was put in commission, and call ed the Scourge. A loan of six gun-boats and two bomb-vessels, completely fitted for service, was ob tained from the king of Naples. Permission was also given to take twelve or fifteen Neapolitans on board each boat, to serve under the American flag. With this addition to his force, the commodore, on the 21st of July, joined the vessels off Tripoli. His squadron then consisted of the Frigate Constitution, 44 guns, 24 pounders. Brig Argus, 18 24 Syren, 18 18 Scourge, Schooner Vixen, 16 6 Nautilus, 16 6 Enterprize, 12 6 Besides six gun-boats, carrying each a twenty-six brass pounder, aud tAvo bomb-ketches, carrying each"], [34, "28 NAVAL BATTLES. a thirteen inch mortar. The number of men engag ed in the service amounted to one thousand and sixty. On the Tripolitan castle and batteries, one hundred and fifteen guns were mounted : fifty-five of which were pieces of heavy ordnance ; the others long eighteen and twelve pounders. In the harbour were nineteen gun-boats, carrying each a long brass eigh teen or twenty-four pounder in the bow, and two howitzers abaft : also two schooners of eight guns each, a brig of ten, and two galleys, of four guns each. In addition to the ordinary Turkish garrison, and the crews of the armed vessels, estimated at three thousand, upwards of twenty thousand Arabs had been assembled for the defence of the city. The weather prevented the squadron from ap proaching the city until the 28th, Avhen it anchored Avithin two miles and a half of the fortifications ; but the wind suddenly shifting, and increasing to a gale, the commodore was compelled to return. On the 3d of August, he again approached to within two or three miles of the batteries. Having observed that sev eral of the enemy's boats Avere stationed Avithout the reef of rocks, covering the entrance of the harbour, he resolved to take advantage of this circumstance. He made signal for the squadron to come within speaking distance, to communicate to the several commanders his intention of attacking the shipping and batteries. The gun-boats and bomb-ketches were immediately manned, and prepared for ac tion. The former were arranged in two divisions of three each. The first divison was under the com-"], [35, "29 NAVAL BATTLES. inand of captain Somers, on board the boat No. 1 ; lieutenant James Decatur commanded the boat No. 2 ; and lieutenant Blake, No. 3. The second divi sion Avas commanded by captain Decatur, in No. 4 ; lieutenant Bainbridge commanded No. 5 ; and lieu tenant Trippe No. 6. The two bomb-ketches were commanded, the one by lieutenant commandant Dent ; the other by Mr. Robinson, first lieutenant of the commodore's ship.. At half past one, the squadron stood in for the batteries. At two, the gun-boats Avere cast off. At half past two, signal was made for the bomb-ketches and gun-boats to advance and attack. At three quarters past two, the signal was given for a general action. It com menced by the bomb-ketches throwing shells into the town. A tremendous fire immediately commenced from the enemies batteries and vessels, of at least tAVO hundred guns. It was immediately returned by the American squadron, now Avithin musket-shot of the principal batteries. At this moment, captain Decatur, with the three gun-boats under his command, attacked the enemy's eastern division, consisting of nine gun-boats. He was soon in the midst of them. The fire of the cannon and musketry was immediately changed to a desperate attack with bayonet, spear, sabre, &c. Captain Decatur having grappled a Tripolitan boat, and boarded her Avith only fifteen Americans ; in ten minutes her decks were cleared, and she was cap tured. Three Americans Avere Avounded. At this moment captain Decatur was informed that the gun-"], [36, "30 NAVAL BATTLES. boat commanded by his brother, had engaged and captured a boat belonging to the enemy ; but that his brother, as he Avas stepping on board, was treacherously shot by the Tripolitan commander, who made off Avith his boat. Captain Decatur im mediately pursued the murderer, Avho Avas retreat ing within the lines ; having succeeded in coming along side, he boarded with only eleven men. A doubtful contest of twenty minutes ensued. Deca tur immediately attacked the Tripolitan commander, who was armed with a spear and cutlass. In parry ing the Turk's spear, Decatur broke his sword close to the hilt, and received a slight wound in the right arm and breast ; but having seized the spear he closed ; and, after a violent struggle, both fell, De catur uppermost. The Turk then drew a dagger from his belt ; but Decatur caught hold of his arm, drew a pistol from his pocket, and shot him. While they were struggling, the crew of both vessels rushed to the assistance of their commanders. And so desperate had the contest around them been, that it was with difficulty Decatur could extricate himself from the killed and wounded that had fallen around him. In this affair an American manifested the most heroick courage and attachment to his commander. Decatur, in the struggle, was attacked in the rear by a Tripolitan ; Avho had aimed a bloAV at his head, which must have proved fatal, had not this generous minded tar, then dangerously Avounded and deprived of the use of both his hands, rushed between him and the sabre, the stroke of which he received in his head"], [37, "31 NAVAL BATTLES. whereby his scull was fractured. This hero, howev er survived, and now receives a pension from his grateful country. All the Americans but four were wounded. Captain Decatur brought both his prizes safe to the American squadron. Lieutenant Trippe boarded one of the enemy's large boats, with only a midshipman, Mr. Jonathan Henly, and nine men ; his boat falling off before any more could join him. He was thus left either to per ish, or to conquer thirty-six men, with only eleven, Though at first, the victory seemed doubtful, yet, in a few minutes, the Tripolitans were, subdued ; four teen of them were killed, and twenty-two taken pris oners. Seven of these last were severely wounded. Lieutenant Trippe received eleven sabre wounds, some of them dangerous. The blade of his sword bending, he closed with his antagonist. Both fell. In the struggle, Trippe wrested the Turk's sword from him, and, with it, stabbed him to the heart. Lieutenant Bainbridge had his lateen yards shot away. This rendered all his exertions to get along side the enemy's boats of no effect. But his brisk and well directed fire, within musket shot, did great execution. At one time his boat grounded within pistol shot of one of the enemy's batteries. He was there exposed to the fire of musketry ; but, by his address and courage, he extricated himself from his dangerous situation. Captain Somers was not able to get far enough to windward, to co-operate with Decatur. He, how ever, bore down upon the leeward division of the en-"], [38, "32 NAVAL BATTLES. emy. With his single boat, he attacked five full manned Tripolitan boats, within pistol shot. He de feated, and drove them in a shattered condition, and with the loss of many lives, to take refuge under the rocks.. The two bomb vessels kept their station, and threw a great many shells into the town. Five of the ene my's gun-boats, and two galleys, composing their centre division, stationed within the rocks, being re inforced, and all joined by the gun-boats that had been driven in, twice attempted to row out and surround the gun-boats and prizes of the Americans. They were, however, prevented by the vigilance of the com modore, who made signal for the brigs and schooners to cover them. This was properly executed by these vessels. Their conduct was excellent during the whole of the engagement, and they annoyed the enemy exceedingly. The fire from the Constitution did considerable execution, and kept the enemy's flotilla in constant disorder. She was several times within two cables' length of the rocks, and three of the batteries. As soon as her broadside was brought to bear on any of the batteries, it was immediately silenced. But having no large vessels to secure these advantages, the fire was recommenced as soon as she changed her position. At half past four, the wind having inclined to the northward, and the enemy's flotilla having retreated to a station which covered them from the fire of the Americans, signal was made for the gun-boats and bombs to retire from the action. This was effect-"], [39, "33 NAVAL BATTLES. ed, and in fifteen minutes the squadron was out of the reach of the enemy's shot. The squadron was more than two hours within grape shot distance of the enemy's batteries, which kept up a constant fire. The damage sustained by the Americans was by no means proportionate to the apparent danger. The frigate Constitution was struck in her mainmast by a thirty-two pound ball, her sails and rigging were considerably cut, and one of her quarter-deck guns was injured by a round shot ; not a man, however, was killed on board of her. The other vessels suf fered in their rigging, and had several men wound ed ; but none were killed, excepting lieutenant De catur. On the part of the enemy the effect of this engagement was very different. The boats cap tured by the Americans had one hundred and three men on board, forty-seven of whom were killed and twenty-six wounded. Three other boats Avere sunk Avith all the men on board of them. Numbers were also swept from the decks of the other vessels in the harbour. On shore, several Tripolitans were kill ed and wounded ; a number of guns in the batteries were dismounted and the town was considerably in jured. When the squadron was standing in for the attack, the bashaw affected to despise them. After having surveyed them from his palace, he. said, \" they will mark their distance for tacking ; they are a sort of Jews, who have no notion of fighting.\" The palace and terraces of the houses were crowded with spec tators to behold the chastisement the bashaw's boats 5"], [40, "34 NAVAL BATTLES. would give the American vessels if they approach ed too near. Momentary, however, was this exul tation. Scarcely had the battle commenced, Avhen no one was to be seen, except at the batteries. Many of the inhabitants fled to the country : and the bashaw retreated to his bomb-proof room. On the 5th of August the commodore prevailed on a French privateer, that had left Tripoli in the morning, to return with eleven wounded Tripolitans, whose wounds had been carefully dressed. The commodore also sent a letter to the bashaw's minister. The prisoners informed the prince, that the Americans in battle where fiercer than lions, but in the treatment of their prisoners, they were even more kind than the mussulmen. The bashaw at first misunderstood the motive of sending these men but when informed that it was done through motives of humanity, he professed to be pleased, and said that if he took any wounded Americans, he should in like manner, restore them : but he Avould not release any of the crew of the Philadelphia. On the 7th the privateer returned with a letter from the French consul, signifying, that the bashaw would probably treat on more reasonable terms. No thing, hoAvever, definitive or satisfactory was pro posed. The terms intimated Ave're considerably high er than the commodore felt willing, or thought himself authorized to accept. He therefore prepared for a second attack. The bomb-ketches, commanded by lieutenants Crane and Thorn, were to take a station in a small bav west of the town, where, without be-"], [41, "35 NAVAL BATTLES. ing much exposed, they might throAV their shells with great effect. The gun-boats were to attack a seven gun battery. The brigs and schooners were to sup port them, in case the enemy's flotilla should ven ture out. At half-past two, the- action commenced. In the course of two hours, six of the seven guns in the battery were silenced. During the action, forty eight shells and about five hundred round shot were thrown into the town and batteries. The Tripolitan galleys man\u0153uvred to gain a position that might en able them to cut off the retreat of the American gun boats ; but the large vessels defeated their design. One of the American prize boats, taken in the first attack, was blown up by a red-hot shot from the bat tery passing through her magazine. She had on board twenty-eight men, ten of whom were killed, and six wounded : among the former were James Caldwell, first lieutenant of the Siren, and J. Dorset, midshipman. Mr. Spence, midshipman, and eleven men, were taken up unhurt. When the explosion took place, this young officer was superintending the loading of a gun ; having discharged the piece, he with the survivers jumped into the sea. They were soon taken up by another boat. At eight in the evening of the same day, the John Adams, Captain Chauncy, joined the Squadron. By him the Commodore was informed, that four frigates were on their passage ; also, that by the appoint ment of a senior officer to one of the frigates, he would be superseded in his command. The govern ment Avas highly satisfied with the conduct of the"], [42, "36 NAVAL BATTLES. commodore ; but had not a sufficient number of cap tains juniors to the commodore to supply all the fri gates with commanders ; nor had information of his brilliant success as yet reached America. The John Adams having been sent out as a trans port, no assistance could, for the present, be received from her. All her guns were stowed by the kelson, and their carriages put away on board of the other frigates. As these last were all to sail four days after the John Adams, further operations were sus pended in expectation of their arrival. On the 9th, the commodore reconnoitred the harbor, in the brig Argus. Next day a flag of truce was seen flying on the shore. The commodore sent a boat, but which, however, was not permitted to land her men. They returned with a letter from the French Consul. By it the commodore was informed that the bashaw would accept five hundred dollars for the ransom of each prisoner, and put an end to the war without any annuity for peace. The sum de manded amounted to about one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. This the commodore rejected ; but for the sake of the captives, and to prevent fur ther effusion of blood, he offered eighty thousand dollars as ransom, and ten thousand dollars as pre sents. The bashaw, however, suspended the nego tiations, and said he would wait the result of another attack. On the night of the 23d, the bomb-ketches Were sent under the protection of the gun-boats, to bom bard the town. The bombardment commenced at"], [43, "NAVAL BATTLES. 37 Iavo a. m. and continued till day-break ; but without much effect. The weather being favorable on the 27th the com modore stood in for Tripoli, and anchored the Con stitution two miles n. by e. from fort English. The light vessels kept under way. As a number of offi cers and seamen of the Constitution were employed in the boat, captain Chauncy, several of his officers, and about seventy seamen, volunteered their servi ces on board her. The gun-boats, accompanied by the Siren, Argus, Vixen, Nautilus, Enterprize, and the boats of the squadron, anchored at three in the morning within pistol shot of the enemy's lines. With springs on their cables, they commenced a brisk fire on the ship ping, town, batteries, and castle. It was warmly re turned from the enemy's batteries. The boats of the squadron remained with the gun-boats to assist in boarding the flotilla in case it should come out. The brigs and schooners kept under way, to harass the ene my, and to support the gun-boats. At daylight, the commodore, apprehensive that the ammunition of the gun-boats might be nearly expended, weighed an chor, and stood in under the direct fire of fort Eng lish, and of the castle, crown and mole batteries. He made signal for the gun-boats to retire from ac tion. Having arrived at a good distance for firing at thirteen Tripolitan gun-boats, and galleys, en gaged with the American boats, he discharged a broadside of round and grape shot at them. One of them was sunk ; two were disabled ; and the remain-"], [44, "38 NAVAL BATTLES. der put to flight. The commodore then continued running in until within musket shot of the batteries He hove to, fired three hundred round shot, besides grape and canister, into the bashaw's castle, town and batteries. The castle and two of the batteries were silenced. A little after six he hauled off. The gun-boats fired four hundred round shot, besides grape and cannister, apparently with much effect. The result of this attack Avas serious on shore. A thirty-six pound ball penetrated the castle, and en tered the apartment of the prisoners. Considerable damage was done to the houses. Several lives were lost. A boat from the John Adams, with a master's mate and eight men on board, Avas sunk by a double headed shot, which killed three seamen and badly wounded another. The French consul, immediately after the attack, renewed the negotiations for peace. They were, however, broken off, in consequence, he thought, of one of the vessels of the squadron approaching the harbour as a cartel. This the bashaw interpreted as a proof of discouragement on the part of the Ameri cans. On the 3d of September, the bomb-ketches being repaired, and also the damages sustained by the other vessels in the action of the 27th of August, the com modore resolved on another attack. The action commenced between three and four o'clock, and soon became general. As the American gun-boats bore doAvn, the boats and galleys gave away, and retreat ed under cover of the musketry, on shore. The"], [45, "NAVAL BATTLES. 39 brigs, schooners and gun-boats, pursued as far as the depth of the water would permit, and within mus ket shot of fort English. The action in this quarter was divided. The brigs and schooners, with one di vision of the gun-boats engaged the fort. The oth er division continued engaged Avith the Tripolitan boats and galleys. The two bomb-ketches, while throwing their shells into the town were exposed to a direct fire from the bashaw's castle, from the crown, mole, and sev eral other batteries. The commodore, perceiving their danger, ran his ship between them and the bat teries, within musket shot. Seventy guns were brought to bear on him from the batteries. But he discharged eleven broadsides with so much effect, that he silenced the principal batteries, and injured the others, and also the town considerably. The wind veering to the northward, and it beginning to blow fresh, the commodore, at half past four p. m. gave signal to retire from the action under cover of the Constitution. Though the frigates and vessels Avere much damaged in this engagement, not a man was lost. The bomb-vessel, commanded by lieutenant Rob inson, had all her shrouds shot away, and was so much damaged in her hull, as to be Avith difficulty kept above water. The Argus received a thirty two pound ball in her hull. It cut aAvay a lower cable as it entered, which so completely destroyed its force, that it fell upon the deck without doing any injury."], [46, "40 NAVAL BATTLES. Commodore Preble had for some time contempla ted sending a fire-ship into the harbor, in order to destroy the flotilla, and injure the town. Captain Somers volunteered his services. He, with the as sistance of lieutenants WadsWorth and Israel, fitting out the ketch Intrepid for the expedition. One hundred barrels of gunpowder and one hundred and fifty shells Avere placed in the hold. Fusees and combustibles were so applied as not to endanger a retreat. On the evening of the 4th of September, captain Somers chose two fast-rowing boats, in order to bring off the people after the vessel should be set on fire. His own boat was manned by four men from the Nautilus and six from the Constitution, with lieutenant Wadsworth. At eight they parted from the squadron, and stood into the harbour. They were convoyed by the Argus, Vixen, and Nautilus, until arrived within a short distance from the batte ries. On entering the inner harbour, and near the point of her destination, the fire ship was boarded and carried by two galleys of one hundred men each. At this moment she exploded Avith the most awful effect. Every battery Avas silenced. Not a gun was fired during the remainder of the night. There is every reason to suppose that captain Somers, on perceiving no means of escape left, and that he should inevitably be doomed to an ignominious captivity, heroically resolved to die, and Avith his own hands set fire to the train, when himself, his companions, and the enemy, met a common death."], [47, "NAVAL BAi'TLLS. 41 Aster this, nothing material occurred until Sep- tember 9th, when the long expected squadron, under commodore Barron, joined the one before Tripoli. Here ended the command of commodore Preble, so honourable to himself and his country. All joined in praising his distinguished merit. The Pope made a publick declaration, that, \" the United States, though in their infancy, had, in this affair, done more to humble the antichristian barbarians on that coast, than all the European States had done for a long series of time.\" Sir Alexander Ball a distinguished commander in the British navy, addressed commo- dore Preble as follows : \u2014 \" I beg to repeat my con- gratulations on the services you have rendered your country, and the hair-breadth escapes you have had in setting a distinguished example. Your bravery and enterprise are worthy a great and rising nation. If I were to offer my opinion, it should be, that you have done well not to purchase a peace with the enemy. A few brave men have indeed been sacri- ficed ; but they could not have fallen in a better cause , and I even conceive it advisable to risk more lives rather than submit to terms which might encour- age the Barbary states to add fresh demands and insults.\" After the junction of the two squadrons, commo dore Preble obtained leave to return home. This he did Avith the greater pleasure, as it would give the command of a frigate to captain Decatur. On his return to the United States, he was received and treated every where Avith that distinguished atten- 6"], [48, "42 NAVAL BATTLES. tion, which he had so fully merited. Congress vot ed him their thanks, and requested the President to present him Avith an emblematical medal.* RENCOUNTER OF THE PRESIDENT AND LITTLE BELT. Pursuant to instructions from the navy depart ment, on the 10th of May, 1\u00b011, commodore Rod gers, commanding the frigate President, sailed from Annapolis for NeAV York. On the 16th, about noon and within six leagues from land, a sail was discover ed to the eastward, standing towards the President. The commodore perceived it to be a man of war ; and supposed it to be the British frigate Guerriere, which frigate, it was also supposed, had, a few days before, impressed a boy from on board an American brig, near Sandy Hook. Commodore Rodgers, considering it his duty to knoAV the names and character of all foreign vessels hovering on the coast resolved to speak to her. He also hoped, that, if she proved to be the Guerriere, he might prevail on her commander to relinquish the young man. At half past three, the commodore perceived his ship to be gaining upon the chase, but the wind decreasing, he did not come up with her till it was too dark to discover her actual force ; nor could he discover to * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 148\u2014163."], [49, "43 NAVAL BATTLES. what nation she belonged, as she declined showing her colours. At fifteen or twenty minutes past sev en, the chase took in her studding sails, and soon after hauled up her courses. She then hauled by the Avind on the starboard tack ; and at the same time, hoisted an ensign or flag at her mizzen peak. It was however, 'too dark to discover what nation it repre sented. Her broadside was now for the first time presented to view. Though her appearance indicat ed a frigate, darkness prevented her actual force be ing ascertained. At twenty minutes past eight, the President being a little forward of the weather beam of the chase, and distant between seventy and a hundred yards from her, the commodore hailed, \"What ship is that?\" To this no answer was given ; but the question Avas repeated from on board the chase. After a short pause, the question was repeated by the commodore and immediately a shot wras fired into the President. Just as the commodore was about giving orders for a shot to be fired in return, one Avas actually fired from the second division of the President. This was returned from the other vessel, by three guns in quick succession, and, soon after, by the remainder of his broadside and musketry. The commodore then gave a general order to fire. The fire from the President having, in a few minutes, produced a partial silence of the guns of the other vessel, the commodore gave orders to cease firing, judging that she must be a ship of very inferiour force, or that some untoward accident had happened to her. This order commodore Rodg-"], [50, "44 NAVAL BATTLES. f ;s soon had reason to regret. The fire was renewed from the other vessel, and tAvo of its thirty-two pound shot cut off one of the fore shrouds and injured the fore-mast of the President. He therefore immedi ately ordered a recommencement of the fire. It con tinued for a few minutes, when the commodore, per ceiving his opponent'? gaff and colours down, his main-top-sail yard upon ' he cap, and his fire silenc ed, again ordered the ,n\u00bbng to cease, to prevent a fur ther effusion of blood. After a short pause, perceiv ing his adversary was not disposed to renew the ac tion, the commodore again hailed, and was informed that she Avas a British ship ; but, from the wind bloAA'ing fresh, he was unable to learn her name. Commodore Rodgers, having informed the British commander of the name of his ship, gave orders to wear ; to run under the lee of the British ship ; to haul by the wind on the starboard tack ; to heave to under top-sails ; and repair the little damage that had been sustained in the rigging. The President continued lying to all night on dif ferent tacks, with lights displayed, that the British vessel might better discern her position, and com mand any assistance that she might require during the night. At day light she was discovered several miles to leeward. The commodore gave orders to bear up and run down to her under easy sail. After hailing her, he sent a boat on board, with lieutenant Creighton, to learn the name of the ship and her commander, with instructions to ascertain the damage she had sustained, and to state how much he regret-"], [51, "NAVAL BATTLES. 45 ted, on his part, the necessity that led to so unhappy a result, and to offer every assistance in his power, in repairing the damages. Lieutenant Creighton, returned with information that the vessel was his Britannick majesty's ship Little Belt, captain Bing ham, of eighteen guns ; and that the captain declin ed accepting any assistance. The Little Belt had nine men killed and twenty-two wounded. No one was killed on board the President, and only a boy wounded. Captain Bingham's account differs materially from the preceding statement. He denies having fired the first gun ; asserts that the action lasted three quarters of an hour ; and even intimates that he had gained the advantage in the contest. Commodore Rodgers's account, from which the one here given is taken, was confirmed by all his officers and crew, on their solemn oath, before a court of inquiry. The court also confirmed all the particulars of his state ment, after a long and minute investigation.* THE PRESIDENT AND BELVIDERE. A formal declaration of war against Great Bri tain was passed by Congress on the 18th of June, 1812, which was proclaimed by the President of the United States on the following day. On the * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 168."], [52, "46 NAVAL BATTLES. Cist, Commodore Rodgers, having received official information of the event, set sail from New York, accompanied by the frigates United States and Con gress, and the brigs Hornet and Argus, in search of a British fleet of merchantmen, which had sailed from Jamaica the preceding month. The folloAving night information was received of the convoy from an American brig, which had passed them four days before, and the squadron crowded all sail in pursuit. The next morning, however, their course was al tered by the appearance of the British frigate Bel videre, to which the commodore immediately gave chase. The pursuit continued from six in the morn ing, till past four in the afternoon, Avhen the Presi dent, having got within gun-shot, commenced a fire with the boAV chase guns at the spars and rigging of the Belvidere, in hopes of crippling her so as to ena ble them to get along side. The Belvidere returned the fire of the President Avith her stern guns, .and the firing was kept up Avithout intermission for about tei. minutes, when one of the President's chase guns burst, by which unfortunate accident sixteen men were killed and wounded ; among the wounded was commodore Rodgers, who had his leg fractured. By the bursting of the gun, and the explosion of the passing box, from which it was served with powder, both the main and forecastle decks were so much shattered as to prevent the use of a chase gun on that side for some time. Orders were therefore given to veer the ship, and a broadside was fired in the hope of disabling the spars of the enemy ; but this"], [53, "47 NAVAL BATTLES. did not succeed. Considerable damage, however, was done to the rigging and the stern. The utmost exertion was now used on board the President, by wetting the sails, &,c. to gain ground of her oppo nent ; but without success. A constant firing was kept up from both ships, until about seven o'clock ; when the Belvidere, having cut away her anchors, started a number of water casks, and thrown over board her boats and every thing that could be spar ed, got out of the reach of the President's shot. The chase was continued till about midnight, when it was given up as hopeless. One of the first shots fired by the President killed one man and wounded six on board the Belvidere ; and the captain was se verely wounded in the thigh by the breaking of the breaching of a carronade. On board the President there were three killed and nineteen wounded, the greater part by the bursting of the gun as above related. ESCAPE OF THE CONSTITUTION. The frigate Constitution, commanded by captain Isaac Hull, had received orders to join the squadron (under commodore Rodgers,) and, for that purpose, sailed from Annapolis on the 5th of July. On the 17th, off Egg Harbour, four ships, apparently men of war, were discovered from the mast-head to the"], [54, "48 NAVAL BATTLES. northward, and in shore of the Constitution ; and, in the belief that it was the American squadron, wait ing her arrival, all sail was made in chase of them. At four in the afternoon, another ship was- seen to the northeast, standing for the Constitution, with all sail set. At ten in the evening, being then within six or eight miles of the strange sail, the private signal was made by the Constitution ; which not being answered, it was concluded that she, and the ships in shore, were enemy's vessels. Captain Hull immediately laid his vessel in the same course with the others, having determined to lie off till daylight to see what they were. Next morning, two frigates were seen from the Constitution, under her lee, one frigate four or five miles, and a line of battle ship, a frigate, a brig and a schooner, ten or twelve miles directly astern, all in chase, and coming up fast, they having a fine breeze, and it being nearly calm where the Constitu tion was. Finding there was but little chance for escape, being then within five miles of three heavy frigates, the Constitution was cleared for action, and two guns were run out at the cabin windows and two at the ports on the quarterdeck. At eight o'clock, four of the ships were nearly within gun shot, some of them having six or eight boats ahead, towing with all their oars and sweeps out. In this perilous situation a neAV expedient was adopted, which was the means of saving the vessel. Being in only twenty-four fathoms water, boats were sent out ahead with anchors, and the *l\u00bbjp"], [55, "49 NAVAL BATTLES ESCAPE OF THE CONSTITUTION FROM A BRITISH SQUADRON."], [56, "50 NAVAL BATTLES. warped up to them, by which they soon began to get ahead of the enemy. They, hoAvever, adopted the same plan, and all the boats from the most dis tant ships were sent to assist those which were near est. For two days and nights the Constitution was thus chased by the British squadron, sometimes with light winds, at others, warping and towing in a calm, seldom much beyond gun-shot distance. On the morning of the 20th, only three of the squadron could be seen from the mast-head, the nearest about twelve miles distant, directly astern. A light breeze now springing up, the enemy was soon left far be hind, and the Constitution, not being able to find the American squadron, arrived safe at Boston. During the whole of the chase the gallant crew ot the Constitution remained at their stations. It is re lated on good authority, that the officers of the British ships expressed their admiration of the skill with which Captain Hull man\u0153uvred his ship and effected his escape. But however brilliantly the nautical knoAvledge and professional adroitness of captain Hull were dis played on that occasion, his generous disinterested ness afterwards, is worthy of universal applause and imitation. The publick notice taken of the affair, and the praises bestowed on the commander, induced him, on his arrival at Boston, to insert the following card on the books of the Exchange Coffee House. \" Captain Hull, finding that his friends inBoston are correctly informed of his situation, when chased by the British squadron off New York, and that thev"], [57, "51 NAVAL BATTLES. are good enough to give him more credit for having escaped it than he ought to claim, takes this oppor tunity of requesting them to transfer their good wishes to lieutenant Morris and the other brave officers, and the crew under his command, for their very great exertions and prompt attention to his or ders Avhile the enemy Avere in chase. Captain Hull has great pleasure in saying, that notwithstanding the length of the chase, and the officers and crew be ing deprived of sleep, and allowed but little refresh ment during the time, not a murmur was heard to escape them.\" CAPTURE OF THE GUERRIERE. On the second day of August, the Constitution again set sail, pursuing an easterly course. She passed near the coast as far down as the Bay of Fun dy; then ran off Halifax and Cape Sable ; and not seeing any vessels for some days, captain Hull steer ed toward NeAvfoundland, passed the Isle of Sables, and took a station off the Gulf of St. Lawrence, to intercept the Canada trade. While cruising here, he captured two merchant vessels. On the 15th, he chased a convoy of five sail, captured one of them, and prevented the prize ship of an American priva teer from being retaken. Having received informa tion that the British squadron were off the Grand"], [58, "52 NAVAL BATTLES.. Bank, and not far distant, he changed his cruising ground, and stood to the southAvard. On the memorable 19th of August, at two p. m. the Constitution being in latitude, forty-one degrees and forty-two minutes north, and fifty-five degrees and thirty-three minutes west longitude, a vessel Avas discovered to the southward. The Constitution instantly made all sail in chase, and soon gained on her. At three p. m. it could plainly be perceived she was a ship, on the starboard tack, under easy sail, close hauled to the wind. At half past three, she Avas ascertained to be a frigate. The Constitu tion continued the chase. At about three miles dis tance, captain Hull ordered the light sails to be ta ken in, the courses to be hauled up, and the ship to be cleared for action. The chase noAv backed her main-top-sail, and Avaited for the Constitution to come doAvn. As soon as the Constitution was ready for action, she bore down, intending to bring imme diately to close action the British frigate, Avhich had about this time hoisted three English ensigns in token of defiance. As soon as the Constitution came Avith in gun-shot, the British frigate fired her broadside ; then filled away, wore, and gave a broadside on the other tack. They however, produced no effect, her shot fell short. The British frigate man\u0153uvred and Avore several times for about three quarters of an hour, in order to obtain a raking position. But not succeeding in this, she bore up under her top-sails and jib with the Avind on the quarter. Captain Hull immediately made sail to bring his ship up with her."], [59, "53 NAVAL BATTLES. CONSTITUTION AND GUERRIERE"], [60, "54 NAVAL BATTLES. At five minutes before six, p. m. the Constitution being along side, Avithin pistol-shot, he ordered a brisk firing to be commenced from all her guns, which were double-shotted with round and grape shot ; and so well directed and so warmly kept up was the Amer ican fire, that, in fifteen minutes, the mizzen-mast of the British frigate went by the board, and her main yard in her slings. Her hull was much injured ; and her rigging and sails torn to pieces. The fire was kept up, in the same spirited manner, for fifteen min utes longer, by the Constitution. She had now taken a position for raking, on the bows of the British fri gate ; when the latter could only bring her bow guns to bear on the Constitution. The grape-shot and small arms of the Constitution completely SAvept the decks of the British frigate. Thirty minutes after the commencement of the action by the Constitution, the mainmast and foremast of the British frigate went by the board, taking with them every spar ex cept the bowsprit. She then struck her colours, which had been fastened to the stump of the mizzen mast. The Constitution then set fore and main-sails, and hauled to the eastward to repair damages. All her braces, a great part of her standing and running rig ging, and some of her spars, were shot away. At seven, p. m. she stood under the lee of the prize, and sent a boat on board, which returned at eight with captain Dacres, commander of the frigate. She was the Guerriere, rating thirty-eight, and mounting forty-nine guns. The hull of the Guerriere was so much shattered, that a few more broadsides would"], [61, "55 NAVAL BATTLES. have sunk her. She had fifteen men killed, sixty one wounded, and twenty-four missing, who, it is presumed, were swept overboard by the falling masts. The Constitution had only seven killed, and seven wounded. The boats were immediately employed in bring ing the wounded and prisoners on board the Constitu tion. About tAvo, a. m. a sail was discovered off the larboard beam standing to the south. The ship was instantly cleared for action. At three, the vessel stood away. At day-break, information Avas received from the lieutenant on board the prize, that the ship was in a sinking condition, and had four feet water in the hold. As soon as all her crew Avere removed from on board of her, she was set on fire, and blew up a quarter past three. Captain Hull, in his letter to the secretary of the navy, says : \u2014 \" that, from the smallest boy in the ship, to the oldest seaman, not a look of fear was seen. They all went into action giving three cheers, and requesting to be laid along-side the enemy.\"* In the heat of the engagement, one of the crew of the Constitution, perceiving the flag at the fore top-mast head had been shot away, went up with it, and lashed it so securely, as to render it impossible to shoot it away, unless the mast went with it. The generosity of captain Hull and his crew was equal to their bravery. Captain Dacres, in his official letter, confesses their conduct to have been \" that of a brave enemy ; the greatest care being taken to pre- * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 175 \u2014 176."], [62, "56 NAVAL BATTLES CONSTITUTION AND GUERRIERE IN CLOSE ENGAGEMENT."], [63, "57 NAVAL BATTLES. vent the men losing the slightest article, and the greatest attention being paid to the wounded.\" The Constitution arrived in Boston harbour the 30th day of August. When captain Hull landed, he was received with every demonstration of affec tion and respect. The Washington Artillery, posted on the wharf, welcomed him with a federal salute, which was returned from the Constitution. An im mense assemblage of citizens made the air ring with loud and unanimous huzzas, which were repeated on his passage up State Street to the Exchange Cof fee House. The street was beautifully decorated with American flags. A splendid entertainment was given to captain Hull and his officers by the citizens of Boston, at which commodore Rodgers and the officers of his squadron were invited. The citizens of Philadel phia subscribed for two elegant pieces of plate \u2014 one to be. presented to captain Hull, and the other to Mr. Charles Morris, his first lieutenant. The legis lature of New York, the council of the cities of Al bany and Savannah, the Congress of the United States, the House of Representatives of Massachusetts , and other public bodies, voted their thanks to captain Hull, his officers and crew. The order of Cincinna ti admitted him as an honourary member. Congress voted fifty thousand dollars as an indemnification to the captain, officers, and crew, for the loss sustained by the destruction of the Guerriere. 8"], [64, "58 NAVAL BATTLES. CAPT. PORTER.\u2014 FIRST CRUISE OF THE ESSEX. The Essex, commanded by captain David Porter, sailed from New York the third of July, 1812, and shortly after fell in with a fleet of transports, under convoy of a frigate and two bomb-ketches, from Ja maica for Halifax, with troops. The Essex kept at a distance until night, Avhen she cut off a brig with one hundred and fifty soldiers on board, Avhich was ransomed for a bill of exchange on London for four teen thousand dollars. The men were disarmed, and an exchange receipt taken for them, and they severally took an oath not to serve until exchanged. The following day captain Porter captured the brig Lamprey from Jamaica, by which he received intelligence that the Thetis frigate, Avith specie and a large convoy was about sailing for England. Every exertion was made to get off St. Augustine in time to fall in Avith them, but without effect, as fresh gales prevailed from the southwest, which increased till the 19th of July, when, by the violence of the tempest, they were compelled to run before the wind. On the thirteenth of August, the British sloop of war Alert, of twenty guns, ran doAvn on the weath er quarter of the Essex. Her crew gave three cheers, and immediately commenced an engagement. But so spirited and well directed a fire was kept up from the Essex, that in eight minutes after the commence ment of the action, she forced the Alert to strike"], [65, "59 NAVAL BATTLES. ESSEX AND ALERT."], [66, "60 NAVAL BATTLES. her colours. She had seven feet water in her hold. She was much cut to pieces, and had three men wounded. The Essex did not receive the slightest injury. Captain Porter, being much embarrassed by the number of his prisoners, amounting to about five hundred, concluded an arrangement with the captain of the Alert for sending them to a British port, in the Alert, as a cartel. The Alert, on her return to the United States, was fitted out as a government vessel. On the 30th of August, the Essex being in lati tude 36 n. longitude 62 w. a British frigate was dis covered standing towards her, under a press of sail. Captain Porter stood for her under easy sail, with his ship prepared for action ; and apprehensive that she might not find the Essex during the night, he hoisted a light. At nine the British vessel made a signal. It consisted of two flashes and a blue light. She was then apparently about four miles distant. Captain Porter stood for the point where she was seen, until midnight, when perceiving nothing of her he concluded it would be best to heave-to for her, until morning, concluding she had done the same. But to his great surprise, and the mortification of] his officers and crew, she Avas no longer in sight. Captain Porter, believed it to be not unlikely, that this vessel, was the Acasta, of fifty guns, sent out, accompanied by the Ring Dove, of twenty-two, to cruise for the Essex."], [67, "61 NAVAL BATTLES. On the 4th of September, the Essex being off the tail of St. George's Bank, two ships of war were discovered to the southward, and a brig to the north ward. The brig was in chase of an American mer chant ship. Captain Porter immediately chased the brig, which attempted to pass, and join the rest of the squadron. This he prevented, and compelled her to stand to the northward. He continued in chase of her, until abreast of the American ship, when the wind becoming light, she escaped by means of her sweeps. On shewing American colours, sev eral signal guns Avere fired by the ships to the southward. All sail was made by them in chase. At four p. m. they had gained the wake of the Es sex, and were coming up with her very fast. Cal culating on making his escape by some man\u0153uvre during the night, he fired a gun to windward. The two ships still continued to gain on the Essex. The largest was considerably to windward of the other, and about five miles astern of the Essex. Captain Porter determined to heave about as soon as it grew dark, and, in case he should not be able to pass her, he determined to fire a broadside into her, and lay her on board. The crew, as soon as the plan was proposed to them, gave three cheers, and were in high spirits. Twenty minutes after seven, the Essex hove about, and stood s. e. by s. until thirty minutes after eight, when she bore away s. w. without see ing any thing more of them. This was the more surprising, as a pistol was fired on board the Essex when nearest to them."], [68, "62 NAVAL BATTLES. The Essex arrived safe in the Delaware a few days after. WASP AND FROLIC. Of all the victories achieved by single vessels, perhaps the most brilliant, and which will probably long stand on record without a parallel, is that of the Wasp, commanded by captain Jacob Jones, over the sloop of war Frolic. On the 13th of October, captain Jones left the Delaware bay in the Wasp, on a cruise. On the 16th, she experienced a heavy gale, in which she lost her jib-boom and two men. On the evening of the next day, about eleven o'clock, being in the track of vessels passing from Bermuda to Halifax, she found herself near five strange sail, steering east ward. Some of them appearing to be ships of war, it was thought better to get farther from them. The Wasp, therefore, hauled her wind, and having reached a few miles to windward, so as to escape or sight, as occasion might require, followed the strange sail through the night. At daybreak, on Sunday morning, captain Jones found that they were six large merchant ships under -convoy of a sloop of war, from Honduras to England. Four of the ships were large and well manned, mounting from sixteen to eighteen guns, and having from forty to"], [69, "63 NAVAL BATTLES. fifty men each. Captain Jones, however, deter mined to attack them. The convoy made their escape under a press of sail. The sloop of war alone remained, which proved to be the Frolic, captain Whinyates, mounting twenty-two guns, and having a crew of about one hundred and twenty men. There was a heavy swell in the sea, and the weather was boisterous. The top-gallant yards of the Wasp were taken down, her top-sails were close reefed, and she was prepared for action. About eleven o'clock the Frolic showed Spanish colours. The Wasp immediately displayed the American ensign and pendant ; and at thirty-two minutes past eleven, came down to windward on the larboard side of the Frolic. When within about sixty yards she hailed. The Frolic then hauled down her Spanish colours ; hoisted the British ensign ; and opened a fire of cannon and musketry. This was instantly returned by the Wasp ; and, nearing the enemy, the action became close and spirited. About four or five minutes after the commence- ment of the action, the main-top-mast of the Wasp was shot away, and, having fallen, with the main-top-sail yard, across the larboard, fore, and fore- top-sail braces, rendered her head yards unmanage able during the remainder of the engagement. In two or three minutes more, her gaff and mizzen-top gallant-sail were shot away. She however kept up a close and constant fire. The sea was so rough, that the muzzles of the Wasp's guns were frequent ly under water. The Americans fired as the side of"], [70, "64 NAVAL BATTLES. their ship was going down. Their shot of course, either struck the Frolic's deck, or below it. The English fired as their vessel rose. Their balls conse quently only struck the rigging, or were ineffectual. The Wasp, having now shot ahead of the Frolic, poured a broadside into her, which completely raked her. She then took a position on the Frolic's lar board bow. A most spirited fire was now kept up from the Wasp, which produced great effect. The fire of the Frolic had slackened so much, that cap tain Jones gave up his intention of boarding her, lest both vessels might be endangered by the rough ness of the sea. But, in the course of a few min utes more, not a brace of the Wasp was left. All had been shot away. Her rigging was so much torn to pieces, that captain Jones was afraid, that her masts, being unsupported, would go by the board ; and the Frolic thereby be enabled to escape. He therefore resolved to board, and at once decide the contest. With this intention, he wore ship, and ran down upon the enemy. The vessels struck each other. The Wasp's side rubbed along the Frolic's bow. The jib-boom of the latter entered between the main and mizzen rigging of the Wasp, directly over the heads of captain Jones and his first lieuten ant, Biddle, who were then standing together near the capstan. The Frolic now lay in so good a po sition for being raked, that it was resolved not to board until another broadside had been poured into her. So near were the two vessels, that while the men were loading the guns, the rammers of the"], [71, ""], [72, "NAVAL BATTLES, WASF AND FROLIC"], [73, "65 NAVAL BATTLES. Wasp were pushed against the Frolic's sides ; and two of her guns went through the bow ports of the Frolic, and swept the whole length of her deck. About this time, Jack Lang, a brave and intrepid seaman, of the Wasp, and who had once been im pressed on board a man of war, jumped on a gun with his cutlass, and was springing on board the Frolic ; when Captain Jones, desiring to fire again before boarding, called him down. But, probably urged on by his impetuosity, he did not hear the command of his captain, and was immediately on the bowsprit of the Frolic. Lieutenant Biddle, per ceiving the ardour and enthusiasm of the Wasp's crew, mounted on the hammock-cloth, to board. The crew immediately followed. But the lieuten ant's feet being entangled in the rigging of the Frolic's bowsprit, and midshipman Baker, in his ar dour to board, laying hold of his coat, he fell back on the Wasp's deck. He directly sprang up, and, as the next swell of the sea brought the Frolic near er, he got on her bowsprit, where Lang and another seaman were already. He passed them on the fore castle ; and was much surprised at not seeing a single man alive on the Frolic's deck, except the sea man at the wheel, and three officers. The deck was slippery with blood, and strewed with dead bodies. As he went forward, the captain of the Frolic, and two other officers, who were standing on the quarter deck, threw down their swords, and made an inclina tion of their bodies, as a sign of submission. The colours of the Frolic were still flying. None of her 9"], [74, "66 NAVAL BATTLES. seaman, probably, dared to go into the rigging, to strike them, for fear of the musketry of the Wasp. Lieutenant Biddle himself immediately jumped into the rigging, and hauled down the British ensign. Possession was taken of the Frolic forty-three min utes after the commencement of the action. She presented a most shocking spectacle. Her birth-deck was crowded with dead, wounded, and dying. Not above twenty of her crew escaped unhurt. Captain Jones immediately sent his surgeon's mate on board. All the blankets of the Frolic were brought from her slop-room for the accommodation of the wound ed. To increase the confusion, both the Frolic's masts fell, soon after taking possession of her, and covered the dead and every thing on deck. In this action, the crews of the vessels were about equal. The British vessel mounted four guns more than the American. The destruction on board of the Frolic could riot be exactly determined ; but, from the observations of the American officers, and the declarations of the English, there could not have been less than thirty killed, and about fifty wounded. The Wasp had only five men killed, and five wound ed. Lieutenant Biddle was placed on board the Frolic. A suspicious sail being perceived to windward, Cap tain Jones ordered him to proceed to Charleston, or any other southern port in the United States. The Wasp intended to continue her cruise. The ships then parted. The suspicious sail bore down very fast. It was at first supposed she was one of"], [75, "67 NAVAL BATTLES. the convoy. The Wasp was immediately cleared for action. As she approached, she proved to be a seventy-four, the Poictiers, captain Beresford. She fired a shot over the Frolic ; and, having passed her, overtook the Wasp, the disabled state of whose rig ging prevented her from escaping. After she was taken possession of, the Poictiers returned to secure the Frolic. Both vessels were carried into Ber muda. This action completely demonstrated the superior skill and spirit of the American naval officers and seamen. The superiority of force certainly was on the side of the British. On the return of captain Jones to the United States, his gallant conduct was not passed unnoticed by his grateful countrymen. The Congress of the United States voted him and his crew twenty-five thousand dollars, in consideration of the loss they sustained by the recapture of the Frolic, also their thanks. They ordered a gold medal to be presented to the captain, and a silver one to each of his officers. This gallant exploit deservedly secured to cap tain Jones and his brave crew, the acknowledgments of their grateful countrymen. The narrow limits of our work, forbid our entering into detail. We shall therefore merely state that pieces of plate, and swords were ordered for captain Jones, and thanks voted to him and his crew, by the legislature of Penn sylvania \u2014 the legislature of the state of Delaware \u2014 the legislature of New York \u2014 the house of repre-"], [76, "68 NAVAL BATTLES. scntatives of Massachusetts \u2014 the citizens of Phila delphia, \u2014 the common council of New York, &c. The order of Cincinnati at New York admitted captain Jones into the Society as an honourary mem ber. Captain Jones, in consideration of his merit, was appointed to command the Macedonian, a thirty-eight gun frigate, just captured from the British. Lieutenant Biddle was promoted to the rank of master commandant.* SECOND CRUISE OF COMMODORE RODGERS. On the 8th of October, commodore Rodgers sail ed again from Boston, in the frigate President, accompanied by the United States, Congress, and Argus. On the 13th, the United States and Ar gus parted from the others in a gale of wind. On the 15th, the President and Congress captured the British packet Swallow, having on board specie amounting to nearly two hundred thousand dollars. On the 31st they captured a South Sea ship, loaded with oil, one of two ships urfder convoy of the Gala tea frigate, to which they gave chase, but lost her in a fog. During the remainder of the cruise, they saw no other British Vessel except the frigate Nymph, which *Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 183\u2014186."], [77, "69 NAVAL BATTLES. escaped in the night. On the 31st of December they arrived at Boston, having been as far to the east as longitude 22, and to the south as far as latitude 17 north. From longitude 22, they ran down the trade wind to longitude 50, and passed to the north, one hundred and fifty miles from Bermuda. In this cruise, the space passed over was not less than eight thousand miles ; and though the President and Con gress returned richly laden, their commanders could not but regret that no opportunity was afforded to try the spirit and discipline of their officers and crews. The cash taken from the Swallow was car ried from the navy yard to one of the banks, in sev eral waggons, escorted by the crews of the frigates and a detachment of marines, with drums beating and colours flying, amidst the huzzas of a large con course of spectators. The specie and gold dust de posited in the bank were said to be worth nearly three hundred thousand dollars. THE ARGUS. After parting from the squadron, as above noted, the Argus, commanded by captain Sinclair, proceed ed to the coast of Brazil, sailed along the north coast, from cape St. Roque to Surinam, thence to the windward of the West Indies, and in every di-"], [78, "70 NAVAL BATTLES. rection between the Bermudas, Halifax, and the con tinent. After a cruise of ninety-six days, she arriv ed at New York, having made five prizes, valued at two hundred thousand dollars. She fell in with a British squadron of six sail, two of which were of the line, and one of them a remarkably fast sailer. The chase was continued for three days and nights, and under various circumstances, but, by unremitted exertions, the Argus eluded the pursuit. Pressed on all sides by the number of the enemy, and often baffled by the unsettled state of the weather, she was at one time within gunshot of a seventy-four, and at an other nearly surrounded. While in this perilous sit uation, she actually captured and manned one of her prizes. UNITED STATES AND MACEDONIAN. On the 25th of October, after being separated from the squadron, the United States, commanded by commodore Decatur, fell in with and captured, off the Western Isles, after an action of an hour and a half, the British frigate Macedonian, captain Carden, mounting forty-nine guns, and carrying three hundred and six men. The Macedonian being to windward, had the advantage of choosing her distance, which was so great, that for the first half hour, the United"], [79, "71 NAVAL BATTLES. States could not use her carronades ; and at no time were they within musket or grape shot. To this circumstance, and a heavy swell of the sea, was as cribed the extreme length of the action. In this contest the superiority of the American gunnery was strikingly obvious. The Macedonian had one hun dred and six men killed and wounded. She was total ly dismasted, and had nearly one hundred shot holes in her hull. On board the United States there were only five killed and seven wounded ; and so little in jury was done to the ship, that, in five minutes after the action, she was fully prepared for another. Shortly after the action commenced, such a torrent of fire proceeded from the United States, that the crew of the Macedonian supposed she was actually on fire, and gave three cheers. The Macedonian was a frigate of the largest class, only two years old, four months out of dock, and re puted one of the fastest sailers in the British service. All the private property of the officers and crew of the Macedonian was given up to them ; that claimed by captain Carden, amounted to eight hun dred dollars, and was paid for by the commodore. An instance of the generosity, which is so predom inant in the breasts of American tars, must not be omitted. John Archibald, one of the crew of the United States, received a mortal wound, of which he soon after died. He left three children to the mer cy of the world and a profligate mother, who had deserted them. When the father of Archibald went on board the frigate, to claim the wages and proper-"], [80, "72 NAVAL BATTLES UNITED STATES AND MACEDONIAN"], [81, "73 NAVAL BATTLES. ty of his son, an inquiry was made into the circum stances of his family. A plan was immediately agreed upon by the seamen for the relief of the or phans. Two dollars was subscribed by each of them ; a sum of eight hundred dollars was made up, and placed in the hands of suitable trustees, for the main tenance and education of his children. Commodore Decatur arrived at New London with his prize on the 4th of December. He receiv ed from all quarters the congratulations of his coun trymen. A gold medal was presented to him by Congress, in testimony of their high sense of his gal-\" lantry, good conduct and services. The legislature of Pensylvania voted him their thanks, and an ele gant sword ; and various other testimonials of pub lic regard were bestowed upon him and his crew. The news of this brilliant victory was received at Washington on the evening of the 8th of Decem ber. It happened, that on that evening, a ball was given in compliment to the officers and navy general ly, and particularly to captain Stewart, in acknowl edgment of his politeness to the citizens of Wash ington on a recent occasion. A large and respecta ble company was assembled, and the scene was graced by the presence of all the beauty and fashion of the city. The room in which the company were assembled had been decorated with the trophies of naval victory. The colours of the Guerriere and Alert, displayed on the walls, roused the feeling of patriot ism, and revived in the mind the recollection of the bravery which had won them. At this time lieuten 10"], [82, "74 NAVAL BATTLES. ant Hamilton arrived with the colours of the Mace donian, and despatches from commodore Decatur He was received with loud acclamations, and escor* ed to the festive hall ; and the colours of the Mac edonian were borne into the room by captains Hull and Stewart, and deposited with those of the Guer riere and Alert. CONSTITUTION AND JAVA. On the arrival of the Constitution in Boston, after the capture of the Guerriere, captain Hull received permission to remain on shore to attend to his private affairs, and commodore Bainbridge was appointed to command in his room. After undergoing the neces sary repairs, she sailed on a cruise along the coast of South America, accompanied by the Hornet sloop of war, commanded by captain Lawrence. In running down the coast of the Brazils, they found the Bonne Citoyenne, a British ship of war, loaded with specie lying in the port of St. Salvador. Commodore Bainbridge here separated from captain Lawrence, leaving him to blockade the Bonne Citoyenne. On the twenty-ninth of December, the Constitu tion, being in 13 degrees south latitude, and 38 west longitude, about ten leagues from the coast of Brazil, at nine a. m. two strange vessels were discovered on her weather bow. At ten they were discovered to"], [83, "NAVAI PATsLE'-! 75 be ships. One of them stood in for the land ; the oiuc* stood off shore towards the Constitution. At ten, commodore Bainbridge tacked ship to the northward and westward, and stood for the sail approaching him. At eleven a. m. he tacked to the southward and eastward, hauled up the mainsail, and took in the royals. At thirty minutes past eleven, made a private signal for the day, which was not answered ; and then set mainsail and royals, to draw the strange vessel off from the neutral coast, and separate her from her company. At twelve, the American ensign and pendant were hoisted on board the Constitution. At fifteen min utes past twelve, the strange vessel hoisted an Eng lish ensign, and displayed a signal at her mainmast. At a quarter past one, the ship in sight proving to be an English frigate, and being sufficiently distant from land, commodore Bainbridge ordered the main sails and royals to be taken in, to tack ship and stand for the enemy ; who soon bore down with an intention of raking the Constitution, which she avoided by wearing. At two o'clock, p. m. the British ship was within half a mile of the Constitution, and to wind ward. She now hauled down her colours, except an union jack at the mizzen-mast head. This induced commodore Bainbridge to order a gun to be fired ahead of her, to make her show her colours. It was succeeded by the whole of the Constitution's broad side. On this, the enemy immediately hoisted co lours, and returned the fire. A geneial action now commenced with round and grape shot. The British"], [84, "76 NAVAL BATTLES. frigate kept at a much greater distance than the com modore wished. He, however, could not bring her to closer action, without exposing his vessel to be sev eral times raked. Both vessels for some time man \u0153uvred to obtain a position that would enable them to rake, or avoid being raked. In the early part of the engagement the wheel of the Constitution was shot away. Commodore Bainbridge determined to close with the British vessel, notwithstanding, in so doing, he should expose his ship to be several times raked. He ordered the fore and mainsails to be set, and luffed up close to the enemy, in such a manner that his jib-boom got foul of the Constitution's mizzen rigging. About three o'clock, the head of the British vessel's bowsprit and jib-boom, were shot away ; and, in the space of an hour, her foremast was shot away by the board, her main-top-mast just above the cap, her gaff and spanker-boom, and her mainmast nearly by the board. About four o'clock, the fire of the British vessel being completely silenced, and her colours in the main rigging being down, she was supposed to have struck. The courses of the Constitution were now hauled on board, to shoot ahead, in order to repair her rigging, which was very much cut. The Brit ish vessel was left a complete wreck. Her flag was soon after discovered to be still flying. The Constitution, however, hove to, to repair some of her damages.

CONSTITUTION AND JAVA."], [86, "78 NAVAL BATTLES. the Constitution wore, and stood for the British ves sel ; and got close to her athwart her bows, in a very effectual position for raking, when she prudent ly struck her flag. Had she suffered the broadside to have raked her, her additional loss would have been extremely great ; for she lay quite an unman ageable wreck upon the water. After the British frigate struck, the Constitution wore and reefed topsails. One of the only two re maining boats out of eight, was then hoisted out, and lieutenant Parker, of the Constitution, was sent to take possession of the frigate. She proved to be his Britannick majesty's frigate Java, rating thiity eight, but carrying forty-nine guns. She was man ned by upwards of four hundred men ; and wa\u00bb commanded by captain Lambert, a very distinguish ed naval officer. He was mortally wounded. The action continued, from the time the firing commenc ed till the time it ceased, one hour and fifty-five minutes. The Constitution had nine men killed, and twen ty-five wounded. The Java had sixty killed, and one hundred and one (certainly) wounded \u2014 but by a letter written on board the Constitution, by one of the officers of the Java, and accidentally found, it is evident her loss must have been much greater. He states it to have been sixty killed, and one hundred and seventy wounded. The Java had her own full complement of men, and upwards of one hundred supernumeraries, for British ships in the East Indies. Her force in num-"], [87, "79 NAVAL BATTLES. ber of men, at the commencement of the action, was probably much greater than the officers of the Con stitution were enabled to ascertain. Her officers were extremely cautious in discovering the number of her crew. By her quarter bill she had one man more, stationed at each gun, than the Constitution. The Java was an important ship. She was fitted out in the most complete manner, to carry lieuten ant general Hislop and staff to Bombay, of which place he had been appointed governour, and several naval officers for different vessels in the East Indies. \u00a7he had despatches for St. Helena, the Cape of Good Hope, and for every British establishment in the In dian and Chinese seas. She had copper on board for a seventy-four, and for two brigs, building at Bom bay ; and probably a number of other valuable arti cles. The great distance from the United States, and the disabled state of the Java, forbade every idea of attempting to bring her to the United States. No alternative was therefore left, but to burn her, which was done, after the prisoners and their baggage were removed to the Constitution. They were all landed at St. Salvador, and paroled. The commander of the Java, captain Lambert, died soon after he was put on shore. The British officers paroled were a lieutenant-general, a major, and a captain, of land service; in the naval service, a post captain, a mas ter and commander, five lieutenants, three lieuten ants of marines, a surgeon, two assistant surgeons, a purser, fifteen midshipmen, a gunner, a boatswain, a"], [88, "80 NAVAL BATTLES. f master, a carpenter, and two captain's clerks ; like wise, three hundred and twenty three petty officers, seamen, and marines \u2014 making all together three hundred and fifty-one men; besides nine Portuguese seamen, liberated, and eight passengers, private characters, who were permit \u00abd to land with out re straint. Lieutenant Aylwin, of the Constitution, was se verely wounded during the action. When the board ers were called to repel boarders, he mounted the quarter-deck hammock cloth*, and, in the act of fir ing his pistol at the enemy, he received a ball through his shoulder. Notwithstanding the severity of his wound, he continued at his post until the enemy struck. A few days afterwards, when an engage ment was expected with a ship, which afterwards proved to be the Hornet, he left his bed, and repair ed to quarters, though labouring under a consider able debility, and under the most excruciating pain. He died on the 28 th of January, at sea. Commodore Bainbridge was received by his coun trymen on his return to the United States, with every demonstration of joy and esteem that his gallant ex ploit merited. The Congress of the United States voted fifty thousand dollars, and their thanks, to commodore Bainbridge, his officers and crew. They likewise ordered a gold medal to be presented to commodore Bainbridge, and silver ones to each of his officers, in token of their esteem. M"], [89, "81 NAVAL BATTLES. The legislatures of Massachusetts and New York, 'itc. voted their thanks to commodore Bainbridge, his officers, and crew.* HORNET AND PEACOCK. The Hornet, of eighteen guns, commanded by captain Lawrence, as stated in the preceding article, sailed in company with the Constitution. Such was me eagerness of captain Lawrenc^ to engage the Bonne Citoyenne, though a much .arger vessel, and having a greater force, both in guns and men, that he sent, through the American consul at St. Salvador, a challenge to her commander, captain Green, pledg- ing his honour, that neither the Constitution, nor any other American vessels should interfere. This pledge was confirmed by commodore Bainbridge, who to show his sincerity, left the Hornet before St. Sal- vador, and sailed on another cruise. The comman- der of the Bonne Citoyenne, however did not see fi to accept of the challenge, out suffered himself to b blockaded by the Hornet. Captain Lawrence con tinued for fourteen days off the harbour of St. Sal vador, blockading the Bonne Citoyenne. Two oth er English vessels were likewise in the same port, namely, the Fox, of twelve guns, and an armed schooner. Ifr * Clark's Naval History, vol. 1. p. 188\u2014192 11"], [90, "82 NAVAL BATTLES. HORNET BLOCKADING THE BONNE CITOVENNB-"], [91, "83 NAVAL BATTLES. On the 24th of January, the Montague of seven ty-four guns, hove in sight, and drove the Hornet into the harbour \u2014 but night coming on, she wore, and stood out to the southward. Captain Lawrence, knowing that the seventy-four had come for the purpose of relieving the Bonne Citoyenne and pack et Fox from blockade, judged it most prudent to change his cruising ground. He therefore hauled by the wind to the westward, with the intention of cruis ing off* Pernambuco. On the 10th of February he captured the English brig Resolution, of ten guns, bound to Maranham, from Rio Janeiro, laden with coffee, jerked beef, flour, fustic, butter, and about twenty-five thousand dollars in specie. As this vessel sailed dull, and as captain Lawrence could not spare hands to man her, he took out the money, and set her on fire. He then ran down the coast for Maranham ; and cruised there a short time. Thence he ran off Sur inam. After cruising off* that coast from the fifteenth to the twenty-third of February, without meeting with a vessel, he stood for Demarara ; and intended should he not be fortunate on that station, to run through the West Indies, on his way to the United States \u2014 but, on the 24th, in the morning, he discov ered a brig to leeward ; to which he immediately gave chase. Not having a pilot on board, he was obliged to haul off\". The fort at the entrance of De marara river bore southwest, distant about two and a half leagues. Previous to giving up the chase, captain Lawrence discovered a vessel at anchor"], [92, "84 NAVAL BATTLES. HORNET AND PEACOCK."], [93, "85 NAVAL BATTLES. without the bar, with English colours flying. She appeared to be a brig of war. In beating round Car obana bank, in order to get to her, at half past three p. m. he discovered another sail on his weather quar ter, edging down for him. At twenty minutes past four, she hoisted English colours. She was now discovered to be a large man of war brig. Captain Lawrence immediately ordered his men to quarters, and had the ship cleared for action. He kept close by the wind, in order if possible, to get the weathergage of the approaching vessel. At ten minutes past five, finding he could weather the ene emy, he hoisted American colours and tacked. About a quarter of an hour after this, the ships pass ed each other, and exchanged broadsides within half pistol shot. Captain Lawrence observing the enemy in the act of wearing, bore up, received his starboard broadside, and ran him close on board on the star board quarter. From that position he kept up a most severe and well directed fire. So great was its effect, that, in less than fifteen minutes the Brit ish vessel struck. She was almost cut to pieces, and hoisted an ensign, union down, from her fore rigging as a signal of distress. Shortly after, her mainmast went by the board. Lieutenant Shubrick was despatched on board. He soon returned with her first lieutenant, who report ed her to be his Britannick Majesty's brig Peacock, commanded by captain William Peake, who fell in the action \u2014 that a number of her crew were killed and wounded \u2014 and that she was sinking very fast,"], [94, "86 NAVAL BATTLES. having then six feet water in her hold. The boats of the Hornet were immediately despatched for the wounded. Both vessels were brought to anchor. Those shot holes in the Peacock that could be got at, were then plugged, and her guns thrown over 6oard. Every exertion was used to keep her afloat, until the prisoners could be removed, by pumping and bailing, but without effect. She unfortunately sunk in five and a half fathoms water, with thirteen of her crew, and three of the Hornet's. Lieutenant Connor, midshipman Cooper, and the remainder of the men employed in removing the prisoners, with difficulty saved themselves by jumping into a boat that was lying on the booms, as the vessel went down. Four men of the Peacock's crew, who were on board when she went down, and were so fortunate as to gain the foretop, were afterwards taken off by the Hornet's boats. Previous to the Peacock's sinking, four of her men took to her stern boat, which had been much damaged during the action. There was little or no prospect of their reaching the land. They, however, arrived safe at Demarara. Captain Lawrence could not ascertain from the officers of the Peacock the exact number of killed. Captain Peake and four men were found dead on board. The master, one midshipman, carpenter, captain's clerk, and twenty-nine seamen of the Pea cock, were wounded ; most of them very severely \u2014 three died after being removed \u2014 nine were drowned. The Hornet had only one man killed, and two slightly wounded. Two men were also severely"], [95, "87 NAVAL BATTLES. burnt by the explosion of a cartridge, one of whom died a few days after. The rigging and sails of the Hornet were much cut. A shot passed through the foremast ; the bowsprit was slightly injured ; but her hull received very little injury. At the time captain Lawrence brought the Pea cock to action, the Espiegle, the brig mentioned as being at anchor, lay within six miles of the Hornet, between her and the shore, and could plainly see the whole of the action. She mounted eighteen guns. Supposing that she would beat out to the as sistance of her consort, great exertions were used by the officers and crew of the Hornet, to repair her damages. By nine o'clock her boats were stowed ; a new set of sails bent ; and the ship completely ready for action. At two o'clock, a. m. the Hornet got under way and stood by the wind to the northward and west ward, under easy sail. On mustering next morning, two hundred and seventy souls were found to be on board the Hornet. As the crew of the latter had been for some time on short allowance, captain Law rence resolved to make the best of his way to the United States. The Peacock was deservedly styled one of the finest vessels of her class in the British navy. She was about the tonnage of the Hornet. Her beam was greater by five inches ; but her extreme length not so great by four feet. She mounted sixteen four and-twenty pound carronades, two long nines, a twelve pound carronade on her top gallant fore-castle"], [96, "88 NAVAL BATTLES. as a shifting gun, and a four or six pounder, and two swivels aft. By her quarter bill, her crew consisted of one hundred and thirty-four men, four of whom were absent in a prize, besides four men and one boy, who were not on her quarter bill. Of the Hornet's crew, the sailing master and seven men were absent in a prize ; and lieutenant Stewart and six men on the sick list. The conduct of the Hornet's crew towards the British seamen, who, by the sinking of their vessel, had lost every thing except what they had on their backs, manifested much humanity and generosity. They raised among themselves a sufficiency to sup ply these distressed seamen, with two shirts, a blue jacket and trowsers each. The surviving officers of the Peacock returned a public acknowledgment to the captain and officers of the Hornet, for the hu manity and kindness wherewith they treated them. Captain Lawrence on his return to the United States was received with great distinction and ap plause. The same tokens of approbation and esteem were conferred on him by public bodies, with which other gallant and successful commanders had been honoured.* CHESAPEAKE AND SHANNON. The Chesapeake frigate, commanded by captain Evans, sailed from Boston about the middle of No- * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 202 \u2014 205."], [97, "89 NAVAL BATTLES. vember, 1812; and after a cruise of one hundred and fifteen days, returned to Boston. During the cruise several captures of some importance were made. The Chesapeake continued in Boston harbour until the first of June, the day of her unfortunate rencounter with the Shannon. Captain Lawrence, of the Hornet, had a short time previous been ap pointed to command the Chesapeake, and hardly had he arrived at Boston, when the Shannon, com manded by captain Broke, appeared off the harbour with the avowed purpose of seeking a combat with her. \" Stung with the repeated disasters of the British frigates, this officer resolved to make an effort to retrieve them ; and when he deemed his ship per fectly prepared for that purpose, sent a formal chal lenge to captain Lawrence. \" ' As the Chesapeake,' his letter began, ' appears now ready for sea, I request you will do me the fa vour to meet the Shannon with her, ship to ship, to try the fortune of our respective flags. To an offi cer of your character, it requires some apology for proceeding to further particulars. Be assured, sir that it is not from any doubt I entertain of your wishing to close with my proposal but merely to provide an answer to any objection that might be made, and very reasonably, upon the chance of our receiving unfair support.' After observing that commodore Rodgers had not accepted several verbal challenges which he had given, captain Broke then proceeds to 12"], [98, "90 NAVAL BATTLES. state very minutely the force of the Shannon, ana offers to send all British ships out of reach, so that they might have a fair combat, at any place within a certain range along the coast of New England which he specified ; if more agreeable, he offers to sail to gether, and to warn the Chesapeake, by means of pri vate signals, of the approach of British ships of war, till they reach some solitary spot \u2014 or to sail with a flag of truce to any place out of the reach of British aid, so that the flag should be hauled down when it was deemed fair to begin hostilities. ' I entreat you, sir,' he concludes, ' not to imagine that I am urged by mere personal vanity to the wish of meeting the Chesapeake, or that I depend only upon your per sonal ambition for your acceding to this invitation. We have both nobler moth as. You will feel it as a compliment, if I say that the result of our meeting may be the most grateful service I can render to my country ; and I doubt not that you, equally confident of success, will feel convinced that it is only by re peated triumphs in even combats, that your little navy can now hope to console your country for the loss of that trade it can no longer protect.' \" The style of this letter, with the exception of the puerile bravado about commodore Rodgers, is frank find manly ; and if the force of the Shannon were correctly stated, would be such a challenge as might well be sent from a brave seaman to a gallant adver sary. We, however, are but too well satisfied, that captain Broke studiously underrated the number of stis guns and crew ; or that, after his challenge, he"], [99, "NAVAL BATTLES. 91 must have received additions to both. That the Shannon had more guns than the number stated by her commander, we learn from the testimony of the surviving officers of the Chesapeake ; who also assert, that she had three hundred and seventy-six men ; that she had an officer and sixteen men from the Belle Poule ; and that the hats of some of her sea men were marked ' Tenedos.' Such as it was, how ever, this letter, most unfortunately, never reached captain Lawrence. If he had received it ; if he had been thus warned to prepare his ship ; if he had had an opportunity of selecting his officers, and disciplin ing his crew ; if, in short, he had been able to place the Chesapeake on any thing like equal terms with the Shannon, the combat might have been more bloody \u2014 there might have been such an engagement as has not yet been seen between single ships on the ocean; though we cannot suffer ourselves to doubt the result of it. But he knew nothing of this challenge \u2014 he saw only the Shannon riding before him in defiance ; he re membered the spirit with which he himself over awed a superior, and he could not brook for a moment that an enemy, which seemed to be his equal, should insult his flag. Although, therefore, the Chesapeake was comparatively an inferiour ship \u2014 although his first lieutenant was sick on shore \u2014 although three of his lieutenants had recently left her ; and, of the four who remained, two were only midshipmen, ac ting as lieutenants \u2014 although part of his crew were new hands, and all of them had lost some of their discipline by staying in port \u2014 yet, as he would have"], [100, "92 NAVAL BATTLES. gone to sea in that situation had no enemy appeared, he felt himself bound not to delay sailing on that ac- count, and throwing himself, therefore, on his cour- age and his fortune, he determined at once to attack the enemy. It was on the morning of the 1st of June, 1813, that the Chesapeake sailed out of the hu*- bour of Boston, to meet the Shannon. As soon as she got under way, captain Lawrence called the crew to- gether, and having hoisted the white flag, with the motto of ' free trade and sailor's rights,' made a short address. His speech, however, was received with no enthusiasm \u2014 on the contrary, signs of dissat- isfaction were evident ; particularly from a boat- swain's mate, a Portuguese, who seemed to be at the head of the malecontents ; and complaints were muttered, that they had not yet received their prize money. Such expressions, at the eve of an action, were but ill-bodings of the result of it; but captain Lawrence, ignorant as he was of the characters of his sailors, and unwilling at such a moment to damp their spirits by harshness, preserved his accustomed calmness, and had prize-checks, at once, given by the purser to those who had not received them. Whilst this scene was passing, the Shannon, observing the Chesapeake coming out, bore away. The Chesa peake followed her till four o'clock in the afternoon, when she hauled up and fired a gun, on which the Shannon hove to. They manoeuvred for some time, till, at about a quarter before six, they approached within pistol shot and exchanged broadsides."], [101, "93 NAVAL BATTLES. \" These broadsides were both bloody ; but th.;* fire of the Shannon was most fortunate in the de struction of officers. The fourth ' lieutenant, Mr. Ballard, was mortally wounded \u2014 the sailing master was killed, and captain Lawrence received a musket ball in his leg, which caused great pain, and profuse bleeding, but he leaned on the companion way, anc continued to order and to animate bis crew. A se cond, and a third broadside was exchanged, with evident advantage on the part of the Chesapeake ; but, unfortunately, among those now wounded on board of her was the first lieutenant, Mr. Ludlow, who was carried below \u2014 three men were successive ly shot from the helm, in about twelve minutes from the commencement of the action ; and as the hands were shifting, a shot disabled her foresail, so that she would no longer i\u00bb? her helm, and her anchor caught in one of the after ports of the Shannon, which enabled the latter to rake her upper deck. As soon as captain Lawrence perceived that she was falling to leeward, and that by the Shannon's filling she would fall on board, he called his boarders, and was giving orders about the foresail, when he received a musket ball in his body. The bugleman, who should have called the boarders, did not do his duty ; andi at this moment, commodore Broke, whose ship had sufTV ad so much that he was preparing to repel board ing ; perceiving, from this accident, how the deck of the Chesapeake was swept, jumped on board with about twenty men. They would have been mstant lv repelled ; but the captain, the first lieutenant, the"], [102, "94 NAVAL BATTLES. sailing-master, the boatswain, the lieutenant of ma rines, the only acting lieutenant on the spar-deck, were all killed or disabled. At the call of the board ers, lieutenant Cox ran on deck, but just in time to eceive his falling commander, and bear him below. Lieutenant Budd, the second lieutenant, led up the boarders, but only fifteen or twenty would follow him, and with these he defended the ship till he was wounded and disabled. Lieutenant Ludlow, wound ed as he was, hurried upon deck, where he soon re ceived a mortal cut from a sabre. The marines who were engaged fought with desperate courage ; but they were few in number ; too many of them having followed the Portuguese boatswain's mate, who ex claimed, it is said, as he skulked below, ' so much for not paying men their prize-money ' Meanwhile the Shannon threw on board sixty additional men, who soon succeeded in overpowering the seamen of the Chesapeake, who had now no officer to lead or rally them, and took possession of the ship ; which was not, however, surrendered by any signal of submis sion, but became the enemy's only because they were able to overwhelm all who were in a condition to resist. \" As captain Lawrence was carried below, he per ceived the melancholy condition of the Chesapeake, but cried out, ' Don't surrender the ship.' He was taken down into the ward-room, and as he lay in ex cruciating pain, perceiving that the noise above had ceased, he ordered the surgeon to go on deck, and tell the officers to fight on to the last, and never"], [103, "95 1NAVAL BATTLES. strike their colours. 'They shall wave,' said he, while I live.' But it was too late to resist or to struggle longer ; the enemy had already possession of the ship. As captain Lawrence's wounds would not allow of his removal, he continued in the ward room, surrounded by his wounded officers, and, after lingering in great pain for four days, during which his sufferings were too acute to permit him to speak, or, perhaps, to think of the sad events he had just witnessed, or do more than ask for what his situation required, he died on the 5th of June. His body was wrapped in the colours of the Chesapeake, and laid on the quarter deck, until they arrived at Halifax, where he was buried with the highest military and naval honours ; the British officers forgetting in their admiration of his character, that he had been but lately their enemy. His pall was supported by the oldest captains in the navy then at Halifax, and no demonstration of respectful attention was omitted to honour the remains of a brave, but unfortunate stranger. \" In this sanguinary engagement the Chesapeake lost her commander and forty-seven men killed, and ninety-seven wounded, of whom fourteen afterwards died. Among these were lieutenant Ludlow, first lieutenant of the ship, and lieutenant Ballard, the fourth lieutenant, both excellent officers. \" On the part of the Shannon captain Broke was dangerously wounded, though he has since recover ed ; the first lieutenant, the purser, captain's cler* and twenty-three seamen killed, and fifty-seven per dons wounded, besides captain Broke."], [104, "CHESAPEAKE AND SHANNON."], [105, "97 NAVAL BATTLES. \" The captuie of the Chesapeake is to be ascribed wholly to the extraordinary loss of officers (a loss without any precedent, as far as we can recollect, in naval history ;) and to her falling accidentally on board the Shannon. During the three broadsides, while the officers of the Chesapeake were living, and she was kept clear of the enemy, the superiority was manifestly with the Americans. The Chesapeake had received scarcely any damage, while the Shan non had several shots between wind and water, and could with difficulty be kept afloat during the suc ceeding night. It was only when accident threw the Chesapeake on board the Shannon, when her officers were unable to lead on the boarders, that captain Broke himself, contrary, we believe, to the regulations of the British navy, left his own ship, and was able, by superior numbers, to overpower the distracted crew of the Chesapeake. \" We have heard many accounts, which we are very reluctantly compelled to believe, of improper conduct by the British after the capture, and of bru tal violence offered to the crew of the Chesapeake. As, however, some allowances are due to the exas perated passions of the moment, something too to the confusion of a bloody and doubtful struggle, we are unwilling to prolong the remembrance of imputations which may be disproved, and perhaps have been ex aggerated. \" But we should wrong the memory of captain Lawrence, we should be unjust to the officers of the American navy, with whose glory all the aspiring 13"], [106, "98 NAVAL BATTLES. ambition of the country is so closely blended, if we omitted any opportunity of giving the last and fair est lustre to their fame, by contrasting their conduct with that of the enemy, or if we forbore, from any misplaced delicacy towards our adversaries, to report chcumstances connected with the fate of the Chesa- peake, which throw a broad and dazzling light on the generous magnanimity of our countrymen.\" Our readers cannot have failed to observe the li berality which was extended to the officers and crews of the Guerriere, Macedonian, and Java, and the still more striking instance of the Peacock. \" When the Chesapeake was taken by the Shannon, the key of captain Lawrence's store room was demanded of the purser. It was given ; but the purser observ ed at the same time, that in the captures of the Guer riere, Macedonian, and Java, the most scrupulous re gard was paid to the private property of the British officers ; that captain Lawrence had laid in stores for a long cruise ; and that the value of them would be a great object to his widow and family, for whose use he was desirous, if possible, of preserving them. This request was not merely declined ; it was haughtiby and superciliously refused. \" However we may mourn the sufferings of that day, the loss of the Chesapeake has not, in our esti mation, varied the relative standing of the marine of the two countries ; nor does it abate, in the slightest degree, any of the loftiness of our naval pretensions. The contest was wholly unequal in ships, in guns, in crews, in officers, in every thing."], [107, "NAVAL BATTLES. 99 \" The Shannon was a better ship ; she had not upon her the curse of that ill-omened name, the Chesapeake. The Shannon was a stronger ship ; she mounted twenty-eight eighteen pounders on the main deck, twenty-two thirty-two pound carronades, and two long brass nine or twelves, on the spar deck, and a large carronade amidships, in all fifty-two guns, be sides this last heavy carronade ; while the Chesapeake mounted twenty-eight eighteen pounders on the main deck, and twenty thirty-two pound carronades, and one eighteen pounder, chase gun, on the spar deck, in all forty-nine guns. \" The Shannon had a better crew. Besides her complement she had seamen from two other ships. That crew, too, had been long at sea ; long in the ship ; were known ; were tried ; and as commodore Broke sent a challenge, were, of course, men on whom, if they were not picked for the occasion, he knew he could confide. The Chesapeake had, on the contrary, in part, a new crew, unknown to their officers, not yet knowing their places or the ship. The ship had not been more than a few hours at sea, and the landsmen and the landswomen had been dismissed from her on the very day of the engage ment. The officers, too, although we should be the last to detract from their merits, and although the manner in which they fought their ship does them the highest honour, the officers were young and few in number, and had as yet hardly any opportunity of disciplining or knowing their seamen ; yet, under all these disadvantages, the great damage sustained"], [108, "100 NAVAL BATTLES. by the Shannon, and the great loss of her crew, all which took place before the boarding, warrant completely the opinion, that, but for the accidental loss of officers, the victory would have been with the Chesapeake.\"* Mr. Crowninshield, of Salem, obtained a flag of truce for the purpose of conveying to the United States the bodies of Lawrence and Ludlow, which he performed. On his return to Salem, the bodies of the departed heroes were conveyed, with the most affecting ceremonies, from the cartel to the shore. From the time the boats left the brig, until the bo dies were landed, minute guns were fired from the ves sels in the harbour. When placed upon the hearses, they were covered with the colours, which they had so lately and so signally honoured, and moved to a convenient distance for the procession to form, which moved to solemn musick, to the meetinghouse. The corpses were then placed in the centre of the church, by the seamen who rowed them to the shore, and who stood, during the whole of the ser vice, leaning upon them in an attitude of mourning. The church was hung with Cyprus and evergreen. The names of Lawrence and Ludlow appeared in letters of gold, encircled by festoons of evergreen, immediately in front of the desk. An eulogy was pronounced by the honourable judge Story. After the performances in the meetinghouse, the seamen con veyed the remains to the tomb, where the masonick societies and military corps, paid the last ritual hom age to the illustrious dead. * Port Folio."], [109, "101 NAVAL battles.

DECATUR BLOCKADED IN NEW LONDON. In the early part of the summer, (1813,) commo dore Decatur, in the frigate United States, accom panied by the Macedonian, captain Jones, and the sloop of war Hornet, put to sea from New York. But a very superior force, consisting of line of battle ships and frigates, hove in sight and gave chase im mediately after he left port. The American squad ron was fortunate enough to reach the harbour of New London, where, for the remainder of the sum mer, they were blockaded, without any thing inter esting occurring except an attempt made to blow up some of the English vessels by a fireship. The fire ship was called the Eagle, and fitted out for the pur pose by John Scudder. It was supposed that on her being captured, she would be taken along side one of the vessels of war, when, in attempting to unlade her, a considerable quantity of powder and other combustibles would have been set on fire. The at tempt was made in the month of June. She was taken possession of by the British ; but blew up be-"], [110, "102 NAVAL BATTLES. fore she got alongside any of their large vessels. At the time of explosion, four boats were seen alongside which were all, with the men on board them, de stroyed. It is supposed that upwards of one hundred of the British perished. CAPTURE OF THE EAGLE. In the month of July, a fishing smack was sent by commodore Lewis, of New York, for the purpose of capturing by stratagem the sloop Eagle, a tender of the Poictiers, a British vessel of seventy-four guns. The smack was borrowed of some fishermen. A calf, a sheep, and goose were put on board. Be tween thirty and forty men well armed with muskets were secreted in the cabin, and fore peak of the smack. Thus prepared she stood out to sea as it going on a fishing voyage to the banks. Only three men appeared on deck, dressed as fishermen. The Eagle, on perceiving the smack, gave chase. After coming along side, and discovering live stock on board, she ordered the smack down to the commo dore, then about five miles off. The helmsman of the smack answered, \" Aye, aye, sir ; \" and put up the helm for that purpose, which brought the smack along side the Eagle, not more than three \"yards distant. The watch word Lawrence, was then given, and the armed Wen rushed on deck from be-"], [111, "NAVAL BATTLES. 103 low ; and poured a volley of musketry into the ten der ; which drove her crew below with so much pre cipitancy, that they had not time to strike her col ours. As soon as sailing master Percival, who com manded the smack, perceived the deck of the Brit ish vessel cleared, he ordered his men to cease fir ing. Upon which one of the Eagle's crew appeared on deck, and struck her colours. The Eagle was safely taken into New York.* THIRD CRUISE OF THE PRESIDENT On the 23d of April, 1813, commodore Rodgers put to sea from Boston, in the President frigate, ac companied by the Congress, commanded by captain Smith. On the 30th he took his departure from President road. On the 3d of May, while in chase of a British brig of war, near the shoal of George's Bank, they passed to windward of three sail, one of which was supposed to be the La Hogue, seventy four ; the others, the Nymph frigate and a merchant brig. After getting clear of George's Bank, they continued along southeastwardly, in the direction of the southern edge of the Gulf stream, till the 8th of May, when the President parted from the Congress. Commodore Rodgers then shaped his course, as near as the wind would permit, to intercept the enemy's * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 209."], [112, "104 NAVAL BATTLES. West India commerce, passing to the southward of the Grand Bank. Not meeting with any thing in this direction, except American vessels from Lisbon and Cadiz, he changed his course to the northward. Having reached the forty-eighth degree of north lat itude, he steered for the Azores, off which he con tinued in different directions till the 6th of June, without meeting any British vessels. Being inform ed by an American vessel, that four days previous she had passed a British convoy from the West In dies, the commodore crowded all sail in chase to northeast. Though disappointed in falling in with the convoy, he nevertheless captured four vessels. Being then in latitude forty-six north, longitude twenty-eight west, he determined to proceed to the North Sea. He however did not meet with a single vessel until off the Shetland Islands, and those he there met with were Danish, under British license. His water and provisions being now nearly exhaust ed, he put into North Bergen, in Norway, on the 27th of June. A scarcity in the country prevented his obtaining provisions. After having filled his casks with water, he departed on the 2d of July, towards the Orkney Islands, and thence towards the North Cape, for the purpose of intercepting a convoy of twenty-five or thirty sail, which, it was said, would leave Archangel about the middle of July, under the protection of two sloops of war, This was confirm ed by two vessels he captured on the 18th of the same. month. In this, however, the commodore was dis appointed by a seventy-four and frigate making their"], [113, "105 NAVAL BATTLES. appearance off North Cape on the 19th of July, just as he was in momentary expectation of meeting the convoy. On first discovering these two vessels, owing to the haziness of the weather, he could not ascertain their character with precision. He accord ingly stood towards them until he discovered their strength, when he hauled by the wind on the op posite tack to avoid them. But owing to faint vari able winds, and light for an entire day, for in that latitude and season the sun appeared above the hori zon at midnight, the British vessels were enabled to continue the chase upwards of eighty hours. At times, owing to changes of the wind in favour of the British vessels, they were brought near to the Presi dent. When these vessels gave chase to the Presi dent, the privateer Scourge of New York was in com pany, but so intent were the British in their chase of the former, that the latter escaped. Having but a very small quantity of provisions on board his vessel, commodore Rodgers determined to proceed to a more westerly station after having es caped from the superior British force that so long chased him. He accordingly steered to intercept the trade passing out of and into the Irish channel where on the 25th of July and 2d of August he made three captures ; but receiving information that the British had a superior force in the vicinity, he deemed it expedient to change his cruising ground. After having made a circuit round Ireland, and hav ing come into the latitude of Cape Clear, he steered for the Banks of Newfoundland, near to which he 14"], [114, "106 X, BATTLES. IVt captured two mo.'\u00a9 ve.sels : from one of these he ob tained informatio- sat the Bellerophon, a seventy four, and the Hyjr-rica frigate, were on the eastern part of the bank, only a few miles to the westward of him. He however did not fall in with them. From this place the commodore directed his cruise to the United States, without seeing a single vessel until the 22d of September, when, being near the south shoal of Nantucket, he met with a Swedish brig, and American cartel. By this time the provi sions, and particularly the bread on board the Presi dent, was so nearly expended, that it became indis pensably necessary for. the commodore to put into the first convenient port, after obtaining information of the position of the British cruisers. This he ob tained by the capture of his Britanick Majesty's schooner High Flyer, on the 23d, with which vessel he arrived safe at Newport. During this cruise commodore Rodgers captured twelve vessels of which the crews amounted to two hundred and seventy-one persons. He rendered very effectual service to his country by harassing the British commerce, and forcing them to detach a great number of their vessels of war in an unsuc cessful pursuit.* It is a circumstance, somewhat singular, that, since the rencounter with the Belvidere, commodore Rodg ers has never met with an English frigate that was not in company with a seventy-four ; notwithstanding he cruised in the European seas, and coasted the * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 213\u2014214"], [115, "107 NAVAL BATTLES. shores of Britain and Ireland. He twice, traversed over more than half the globe, without meeting a British frigate ; and though he sought them in their own seas, and along their own shores, he never had the good fortune to bring one of them to action. Yet, with all this, commodore Rodgers has suffered no diminution of reputation. It is creditable to the American character, to cherish and uphold the high reputation of a meritorious officer, notwithstanding opportunities have not been given him to display his skill and prowess against an equal force of the enemy. CRUISE OF THE CONGRESS. The Congress, after parting with the President, on the 8th of May, proceeded, in a circuitous direc tion, to the southeast, crossing the equator, passing the northeast coast of Brazil, and thence homeward. During this cruise, captain Smith made prizes of three valuable vessels of the enemy, two of which were destroyed, after taking out the most valuable part of their cargoes ; and the other given up to the prison ers, who were paroled. He arrived in Portsmouth harbour on the 14th of December."], [116, "108 NAVAL BATTLES. ARGUS AND PELICAN. Captain Allen, in the brig Argus, sailed from the United States for France, having on board Mr. Crawford, minister to the court of Paris, in May, 1813. He arrived there in the short passage of twenty-three days, during which he captured and destroyed a British schooner of six guns. After remaining at L'Orient a few days, he pro ceeded on a cruise in the British channel, where he captured twenty English vessels ; the crews of which he treated with humanity and generosity. The injury which captain Allen did to the British commerce is, in some of their papers, estimated to the amount of two millions. While employed in burning, sinking and destroying the enemy's proper ty, he was peculiarly careful to distinguish his char acter from those who depredated for selfish purposes only. The property of the passengers was sacred from hostility ; not an article of that kind would he suffer to be touched. The passengers were allowed to go below, and to take what they claimed as their own, and no hands belonging to the Argus were permitted to inspect them while they were employed in so doing. On one occasion, when a passenger had left his surtout behind him, it was sent after him, in the boat : on another occasion, captain Allen ordered one of his hands, who was detected in the act of some petty"], [117, "109 NAVAL BATTLES ARGUS BURNING BRITISH VESSELS"], [118, "110 BATTLES. (V plunder of this kind, \u00ab o be flogged at the gangway. The English papers, while they were writhing under the severe injuries thus inflicted, were unanimous in their testimonials of ryspect to the conduct of this gallant officer, for the humanity and delicacy with which he performed a service so invidious. Probably no action of his life cculd more plainly distinguish his character than this : he loved danger as much as he abhorred to plunder the defenceless. On the 14th of August, being in latitude fifty-two degrees fifteen minutes north, longitude five de grees fifty minutes west, he discovered, at four o'clock, a. m. a large brig of war, standing down under a press of sail upon the weather quarter of the Argus. Captain Al'en immediately prepared to re ceive her; and ben-g UEable to get the weathergage, he shortened sail, and gave her an opportunity ot closing. At six o'clock, the brig having displayed English colours, the Argus hoisted the American flag, wore round, and gave her the larboard broad side, being at this time within grape distance, which was returned, and the ection commenced within the range of musketry. A ew minutes past six, captain Allen was wounded ; h ad, being much exhausted by the loss of blood, was \"aken below. At this time, the Argus had lost her main braces, main springstay, gaff, and try-sail masi: and shortly after her sprit sail-yard, and the princ pal part of the rigging on the larboard side of the fc emast. Lieutenant Watson, upon whom the command of the vessel devolved, af ter captain Allen w^ s carried below, received a"], [119, "NAVAL BATTLES. 111 wound on the head from a grape shot, which, for a time, rendered him incapable of attending to duty, and he was also carried below. The command now devolved upon lieutenant Allen ; the enemy, being on the weather quarter of the Argus, edged off, for the purpose of getting under her stern, but the Argus frustrated his attempt by giving him a broadside. About half past six, the Argus, having lost the use of her after-sails fell before the wind, when the enemy succeeded in passing her stern, and ranged upon the starboard side. The Wheel-ropes, and rigging of every description being shot away, the Argus became unmanageable ; and the enemy, not having sustained any apparent damage, had it com- pletely in his power to choose a position. By this advantage he profited, and continued to play upon her starboard quarter, occasionally shifting his situa- tion, when lieutenant Watson returned to the deck, and prepared to board the enemy ; but, in conse- quence of the shattered condition of the Argus, was unable to effect it. After this, the British continued a raking fire, which could be but faintly opposed, the guns of the Argus being much disabled, and seldom brought to bear. Having suffered in the hull and rigging, and also in killed and wounded, and being exposed to a galling fire, which, from the enemy's ability to manage, could not be avoided, lieutenant Watson deemed it necessary to surrender. The Ar gus was then taken possession of by the British sloop of war Pelican, of twenty-one carriage guns, viz. sixteen thirty-two pound carronades, four long sixes, >"], [120, "112 NAVAL BATTLES. and one twelve pound carronade, commanded by captain Maples. The Argus carried eighteen twen ty-four pounders, and two long twelves. The loss on board the Pelican', as stated in the British official account, was eight in killed and wounded. The loss in the Argus was six killed and twelve wounded. Five of the wounded died soon after, among whom was captain Allen, who lost his leg at the second broadside, and died the next day. It would be unjust to the feelings which are reviv ed by the preceding account, and ungrateful to the memory of a brave and distinguished officer, to re cord in our pages only the circumstances which cost him his life, and his countrymen so much poignant regret. The prominent traits of his character, and the honours paid to his remains, in a foreign land, and by those who were his adversaries in war, should be co-extensive with every register of naval achieve ments. The following letter from John Hawker, Esq. ci-devant American consul, will be read with interest. Plymouth, August 19, 1813.

Early in the action he lost his left leg, but refused to be carried below, till from loss of blood he fainted. Messrs. Edwards and Delphy, midshipmen, and four seamen were killed ; and lieutenant Watson, the carpenter, boatswain, boatswain's mate, and seven men wounded. Captain Allen submitted to amputa tion above the knee, while at sea. He was yester day morning attended by very eminent surgical gen tlemen, and removed from the Argus to the hospital. where every possible attention and assistance would have been afforded him had he survived ; but which was not, from the first moment, expected, from the shattered state of his thigh. At eleven, last night, he breathed his last ! He was sensible, at intervals, until within ten minutes of his dissolution, when he sunk exhausted, and expired without a struggle ! His lucid intervals were very cheerful, and he was satisfied and fully sensible that no advice and assist ance would be wanting. A detached room was pre pared by the commissary and chief surgeon, and fe male attendants engaged, that every tenderness and respect might be experienced. The master, purser surgeon, and one midshipman, accompanied captain Allen, who was also attended by his two servants. I have communicated and arranged with the offi cers respecting the funeral, which will be in the most respectful, and at the same time economical manner. The port admiral has signified that it is the intention of his Britannick majesty's government, that it be 15"], [122, "114 NAVAL BATTLES. publickly attended by officers of rank, and with mili tary honours. The time fixed for procession is on Saturday, at eleven, a. m. A lieutenant-colonel's guard of the royal marines is also appointed. A wainscoat coffin has been ordered; on the breast plate of which will be inscribed as below.* Mr. Delphy, one of the midshipmen, who lost both legs, and died at sea, was buried yesterday in St. Andrew's churchyard. I have requested that captain Allen may be buried as near him, on the right (in the same vault, if practicable,) as possible. I remain, respectfully, sir, your most obedient, humble servant.

Thus lived and thus died William Henry Allen. By the company and conversation of the elegant and polite, the hard and severe duties of the sailor acquired a sort of polish, and his character present ed that combination of gallantry, grace and intrepi dity, that so irresistibly attracts. In the hour of danger, he was calm, intrepid and persevering ; in pri vate intercourse, guarded, affable and delicate. En tering into the navy with large and expanded ideas of honour, the perils he encountered, and the hard ser vices he endured, consolidated his romantick and floating visions into rules and principles of action. By never lowering his lofty standard amidst the jus tie of contending difficulties, he at length arrived at it ; and new trials served only to call into exercise new and unexplored resources of fortitude. He had so long forsaken every other consideration for glory, that he finally measured his life by this standard, and felt a repulsive antipathy to whatever fell short of that measure. There has seemed a sort of compact among our naval commanders, never to quit their station on deck. Allen, in his mutilated state, refused to be carried below, and fainted on the deck from loss of blood. Lawrence showed the same determined spir it, and never left his station until he was too far ex hausted by his wounds to animate his men by his ex ample. Burrows, although mortally wounded at his"], [125, "117 NAVAL BATTLES. quarters, still remained at his post, survived the ac tion, and there received the sword of his gallant and intrepid antagonist. The following extract from captain Allen's letter, addressed to his sister, will show the character of this intrepid officer in an amiable light : \" When you shall hear that I have ended my earth ly career, that I only exist in the kind remembrance of my friends, you will forget my follies, forgive my faults, call to mind some little instances dear to re flection, *to excuse your love for me, and shed one tear to the memory of HENRY.\" ENTERPRIZE AND BOXER. On the 1st of September, the United States brig Enterprize, commanded by lieutenant William Bur- rows, sailed from Portsmouth on a cruise. On the morning of the 3d, Burrows discovered a schooner, which was chased into Portland harbour, where the Enterprize was brought to anchor. Having received information of several privateers being off Manhagan, he weighed anchor and swept out the following jnorning, and stood for that place. Next day a large brig of war was discovered, to which chase was im- mediately given. The enemy fired several guns, and stood for the Enterprize, with four ensigns hoist- ed. After man\u0153uvring and reconnoitering for some"], [126, "118 NAVAL BATTLES. time for the purpose of discovering the force of the enemy, lieutenant Burrows, about three in the after noon, shortened sail, tacked, and run down, with the intention of bringing her to close action. At twenty minutes after three the firing commenced from both vessels, within half pistol shot. The action.contin ued for about a quarter of an hour, when the Enter prize ranged ahead of the enemy, rounded to, and raked her. Shortly after the main-top-mast and top \u25a0 sail-yard of the enemy came down. The foresail of the Enterprize was then set, and she took a position on the Starboard bow of the enemy, and continued to rake her, until, about forty minutes after the com mencement of the action, the enemy ceased firing, and cried for quarters : their colours being nailed to the masts, could not be hauled down. The prize proved to be the British brig Boxer, of fourteen guns. The number of her crew could not be ascertained, but sixty-four prisoners were taken, including seventeen wounded. On board the Enter prize there was Only one killed and thirteen wounded, two of whom died of their wounds. Lieutenant Burrows fell in the commencement of the action, he, however, refused to be carried below, but, raising his head, requested that the flag might never be struck. When the sword of the vanquished enemy was presented to the dying conqueror, he clasped his hands and said, \" I am satisfied ; I die contented ;\" and then, and not till then, would he consent to be carried below, where every attention was paid to save his life, but in vain. A few hours"], [127, "NAVAL BATTLES. 119 ENTERPRIZE AND BOXER"], [128, "120 NAVAL BATTLES. after the victory he breathed his last. \u2014 Captain Blythe, the commander of the Boxer, also fell in the commencement of the action, having received a can non shot through the body. His remains, in compa ny with those of lieutenant Burrows, were brought to Portland, where the two commanders were inter red, side by side,, with military honours. The Boxer was so much damaged in her sails, rig ging, spars, hull, &c. as to render it difficult to carry her into port. The Enterprize received but trifling injury. On an examination of the prize, she was ad judged wholly to the captors, agreeably to law, as a vessel of superior force. Soon after the arrival of the Enterprize and her prize at Portland, the bodies of the two commanding officers, lieutenant Burrows and captain Blythe, were brought on shore in ten oared barges, rowed at min ute strokes by masters of ships, accompanied by most of the barges and boats in the harbour, while minute guns were fired from the two vessels. A grand procession was then formed, the corpse of lieu tenant Burrows preceding, and the interment took place with all the honours that the civil and military authorities at the place, and the great body of the people, could bestow. During the procession forts Preble and Scammel, (names dear to their country,) fired minute guns. It is worthy of record that the crew of the Boxer were permitted to march in the late procession at Port land, when their late captain was interred. Such was not the case with the crew of the Chesapeake."], [129, "121 NAVAL BATTLES. The following documents we think will be read with more satisfaction than any thing we could write on the same subject ; especially the letter from lieut enant M'Call, the officer on whom the command of the Enterprize devolved after lieutenant Burrows was rendered incapable of directing the action. Copy of a letter from captain Hull to the Secretary of the Navy, Portland, September 7, 1813. Sir, \u2014 I had the honour last evening to forward you by express, through the hands of commodore Bainbridge, a letter received from Samuel Storer, Esq. navy agent at this place, detailing an account of the capture of the British brig Boxer by the United States brig Enterprize. I now have to inform you that I left Portsmouth this morning, and have this moment arrived, and, as the mail is closing, I have only time to enclose you the report of lieutenant M'Call, of the Enterprize, and to assure you that a statement of the situation of the two vessels as to the damage they have re ceived, &c. shall be forwarded as soon as surveys can be made. The Boxer has received much damage in her hull, masts and sails, indeed it was with difficulty she could be kept afloat to get her in. The Enter prize is only injured in her masts and sails. I have the honour to be, &c. ISAAC HULL. The Hon. Wm. Jones, Secretary of the Navy. 16"], [130, "122 NAVAL BATTLES. United States brig Enterprize, Portland, September 7, 1813 Sir, \u2014 In consequence of the unfortunate death of lieutenant-commandant William Burrows, late com mander of this vessel, it devolves on me to acquaint you with the result of the cruise. . After sailing from Portsmouth on the 1st instant, we steered to the eastward ; and on the morning of the 3d, off Wood Island, discovered a schooner, which we chased into this harbour, where we anchored. On the morning of the 4th, weighed anchor and swept out, and con tinued our course to the eastward. Having re ceived information of several privateers being off Manhagan, we stood for that place ; and on the fol lowing morning, in the bay near Penguin Point, dis covered a brig getting under way, which appeared to be a vessel of war, and to which we immediately gave chase. She fired several guns and stood for us, having four ensigns hoisted. After reconnoitering and discovering her force, and the nation to which she belonged, we hauled upon a wind to stand out of the bay, and at three o'clock shortened sail, tack ed to run down with an intention to bring her to close action. At twenty minutes after three, p. m. when within half pistol shot, the firing commenced from both, and after being warmly kept up, and with some manoeuvring, the enemy hailed and said they had surrendered, about four, p. m. \u2014 their colours being nailed to the masts, could not be hauled down. She proved to be his Britannick majesty's brig Boxer, of fourteen guns, Samuel Blythe, Esq. commander, who fell in the early part of the engagement, having re-"], [131, "123 NAVAL BATTLES. ceived a canuon shot through the body. And I am sorry to add that lieutenant Burrows, who had gal lantly led us into action, fell also about the same time by a musket ball, which terminated his existence in eight hours. The Enterprize suffered much in spars and rigging and the Boxer in spars, rigging and hull, having many shots between wind and water. It would be doing injustice to the merit of Mr. Tillinghast, second lieutenant, were I not to men tion the able assistance I received from him during the remainder of the engagement, by his strict at tention to his own division and other departments. And of the officer^ and crew generally, I am happy to add, their cool determined conduct have my warmest approbation and applause. As no muster roll that can be fully relied on has come into my possession, I cannot exactly state the number killed and wounded on board the Boxer, but from information received from the officers of that vessel, it appears there were between twenty and twenty-five killed and fourteen wounded. Enclosed is a list of the killed and wounded on board of the Enterprize. I have the honour to be, &c. EDWARD R. M'CALL, Senior Officer. Isaac Hull, Esq. commanding naval officer on the eastern station.

Captain Hull, with the officers and crew of the Enterprize, embrace the present occasion to express the sense which they entertain of the prompt atten tion and of the active and humane exertions of Sam uel Storer, Esq. the United States navy agent at Portland, in having every accommodation provided for the wounded on board the United States brig Enterprize as well as those on board the Boxer, be tween whom no distinction was made. And they likewise beg the physicians of Portland who have been so kind as to afford the most prompt and am-"], [133, "125 NAVAL BATTLES. pie exercise of their professions towards the wound ed of both vessels, to accept their best thanks. Extract of a letter from captain Hull to commodore Bainbridge, dated, September 10, 1813. \"I yesterday visited the two brigs, and was aston ished to see the difference of injury sustained in the action. The Enterprize has but one eighteen pound shot in her hull, one in her mainmast, and one in her foremast; her sails are much cut with grape shot, and there are a great number of grape lodged in her sides, but no injury done by them. The Boxer has eighteen or twenty eighteen pound shot in her hull, most of them at the water's edge \u2014 several stands of eighteen pound grape stick in her side, and such a quantity of small grape that I did not undertake to count them. Her masts, sails and spars, are literal ly cut to pieces, several of her guns dismounted and unfit for service ; her top gallant forecastle nearly tak en off by the shot, her boats cut to pieces, and her quarters injured in proportion. To give you an idea of the quantity of shot about her, I inform you that I counted in her mainmast alone three eighteen pound shot holes, eighteen large grape shot holes, sixteen musket ball holes, and a large number of smaller shot holes, without counting above the cat harpists. \" We find it impossible to get at the number kil led ; no papers are found by which we can ascertain it\u2014 I however, counted upwards' of ninety hammocks which were in her netting with beds in them, besides several beds without hammocks*; and she has excel-"], [134, "126 NAVAL BATTLES. accommodations for all her officers below in state rooms, so that I have no doubt that she had one hun dred men on board. We know that she has several of the Rattler's men on board, and a quantity of wads was taken out of the Rattler, loaded with four large grape shot, with a small hole in the centre to put in a cartridge that the inside of the wad may take fire when it leaves the gun. In short, she is in every re spect completely fitted, and her accomodations ex ceed any thing I have seen in a vessel of her class.\" A publick dinner was given at Portland to lieute nant M'Call and the other officers of the Enterprize, for their gallant conduct in the action with the Box er. THE ESSEX. Captain Porter, in the frigate Essex, proceeded to sea from the Delaware, on the twenty-seventh of; October, 1812, and repaired, agreeably to instruc tions from commodore\" \"Bainbridge, to the coast of Brazil, where different places of rendezvous had been arranged between them. In the course of his cruise on this coast he captured his Britannick majes ty's packet Nocton, and after taken out of her about eleven thousand pounds sterling in specie, ordered her for America. Hearing of commodore Bain bridge's victorious action with the Java, which would"], [135, "NAVAL BATTLES. 127 oblige him to return to port, and of the capture of the Hornet by the Montague, and learning that there was a considerable augmentation of British force on the coast, and several ships in pursuit of him, he abandoned his hazardous cruising ground, and stretch ed away to the southward, scouring the coast as far as Rio de la Plata. From thence he shaped his course for the Pacifick Ocean, and, after suffering greatly for want of provisions, and heavy gales off Cape Horn, arrived at Valparaiso, on the 14th of March, 1813. Having victualled his ship, he ran down the coast of Chili and Peru, and fell in with a Peruvian corsair, having on board twenty-four Ameri cans, as prisoners, the crews of two whaling ships, which she had taken on the coast of Chili. The Peruvian captain justified his conduct on the plea of being an ally of Great Britain, and the expectation likewise of a speedy war between Spain and the United States. Finding him resolved to persist in similar aggressions, captain Porter threw all his guns and ammunition into the sea, liberated the Americans, and wrote a respectful letter to the viceroy explain ing his reasons for so doing, which he delivered to the captain. He then proceeded to Lima, and lucki ly recaptured one of the American vessels as she was entering the port. After this he cruised for several months in the Pacifick, inflicting immense injury on the British commerce in those waters. He was particularly destructive to the shipping employed in the sperma ceti whale fishery. A great number with valuable"], [136, "128 NAVAL BATTLES. cargoes were captured ; two were given up to the prisoners ; three sent to Valparaiso and laid up ; three sent to America ; one of them he retained as a storeship, and another he equipped with twenty guns, called the Essex junior, and gave the command of her to lieutenant Downes. Most of these ships mount ed several guns, and had numerous crews ; and as several of them were captured by boats or by prizes, the officers and men of the Essex had frequent op portunities of showing their skill and courage, and of acquiring experience and confidence in naval con flict. Having now a little* squadron under his command, captain Porter became a complete terror in those seas. As his numerous prizes supplied him abund antly with provisions, clothing, medicine, and naval stores of every description, he was enabled for a long time to keep the sea, without sickness or inconve nience to his crew ; living entirely on the enemy, and being enabled to make considerable advances of pay to his officers and crew without drawing on government. The unexampled devastation achieved by his daring enterprises, not only spread alarm throughout the ports of the Pacifick, but even occa sioned great uneasiness in Great Britain. Numerous ships were sent out to the Pacifick in pursuit of him ; others were ordered to cruise in the China seas, off New Zealand, Timor and New Hol land, and a frigate sent to the river La Plata. The manner in which captain Porter cruised, however, completely baffled pursuit. Keeping in the open"], [137, "129 NAVAL BATTLES. sea, or lurking among the numerous barren and des olate islands that form the Gallipagos group, and never touching on the American coast, he left no tra ces by which he could be followed ; rumour, while it magnified his exploits, threw his pursuers at fault ; they were distracted by vague accounts of captures made at different places, and of frigates supposed to be the Essex hovering at the same time off different coasts and haunting different islands. In the mean while captain Porter, though wrapped in mystery and uncertainty himself yet received fre quent and accurate accounts of his enemies, from the various prizes which he had taken. Lieutenant Downes, also, who had convoyed the prizes to Val paraiso, on his return, brought advices of the expect ed arrival of commodore Hillyar in the Ph\u0153be fri gate rating thirty-six guns accompanied by two sloops of war. Glutted with spoil and havock, and sated with the easy and inglorious captures of mer chantmen, captain Porter now felt eager for an op portunity to meet the enemy on equal terms, and to signalize his cruise by some brilliant achievement. Having been nearly a year at sea, he found that his ship would require some repairs, to enable her to face the foe ; he repaired, therefore, accompanied by several of his prizes, to the Island of Nooah eevah, one of the Washington group, discovered by a captain Ingraham of Boston. Here he landed, took formal possession of the island in the name of the government of the United States, and gave it the name of Madison's Island. He found it large, pop- 17"], [138, "130 NAVAL BATTLES. ulous and fertile, abounding with the necessaries of life ; the natives in the vicinity of the harbour which he had chosen received him in the most friendly manner, and supplied him with abundance of provi sions. During his stay at this place he had several encounters with some hostile tribes on the island, whom he succeeded in reducing to subjection. Having calked and completed overhaled the ship, made for her a new set of water casks, and taken on board from the prizes provisions and stores for up wards of four months, he sailed for the coast of Chili on the 12th December, 1813. Previous to sailing he secured the three prizes which had accompanied him, under the guns of a battery erected for their protection, and left them in charge of lieutenant Gamble of the marines and twenty-one men, with or ders to proceed to Valparaiso, after a certain period. After cruising on the coast of Chili without suc cess, he proceeded to Valparaiso, in hopes of falling in with commodore Hillyar, or, if disappointed in this wish, of capturing some merchant ships said to be ex pected from England. While at anchor at this port, commodore Hillyar arrived, having long been search ing in vain for the Essex, and almost despairing of ever meeting with her. Contrary to the expectations of captain Porter, however, commodore Hillyar, besides his own frigate, superior in itself to the Essex, was accompanied by the Cherub sloop of war, strongly armed and manned. These ships, having been sent out expressly to seek for the Essex, were in prime order and equipment, with picked crews, and hoisted"], [139, "131 NAVAL BATTLES. flags bearing the motto \" God and country, British sailors' best rights : traitors offend both.\" This was in opposition to captain Porter's motto of \" Free trade and sailors' rights,\" and the latter part of it suggested doubtless, by errour industriously cherish ed, that our crews are chiefly composed of English seamen. In reply to this motto captain Porter hoist ed at his mizzen, \" God, our country, and liberty : tyrants offend them.\" On entering the harbour the Ph\u0153be fell foul of the Essex in such manner as to lay her at the mercy of captain Porter ; out of re spect, however, to the neutrality of the port, he did not take advantage of her exposed situation. This forbearance was afterwards acknowledged by com modore Hillyar, and he passed his word of honour to observe like conduct while they remained in port. They continued therefore, while in harbour and on shore in the mutual exchange of courtesies and kind offices that should characterise the private intercourse between civilized and generous enemies. And the crews of the respective ships often mingled together and passed nautical jokes and pleasantries from one to the other. On getting their provisions on board, the Ph\u0153be and Cherub went off the port, where they .cruised for six weeks, rigorously blockading captain Porter. Their united force amounted to eighty-one guns and five hundred men, in addition to which they took on board the crew of an English letter of marque lying in port. The force of the Essex consisted of but forty-six guns, all of which, excepting six. long"], [140, "132 NAVAL BATTLES. twelves, were twenty-two pound carronades, only serviceable in close fighting. Her crew, having been much reduced by the manning of prizes, amounted to but two hundred and fifty-five men. The Essex junior being only intended as a storeship, mounted ten eighteen pound carronades and ten short sixes with a complement of only sixty men. This vast superiority of force on the part of the enemy prevented all chance of encounter, on any thing like equal terms, unless by express covenant between the commanders. Captain Porter, there fore, endeavoured repeatedly to provoke a challenge (the inferiority of his frigate to the Ph\u0153be not jus tifying him in making the challenge himself,) but without effect. He tried frequently also to bring the Ph\u0153be into single action ; but this commodore Hillyar warily avoided, and always kept his ships so close together as to frustrate captain Porter's attempts. Finding it impossible to bring the enemy to equal combat ; and fearing the arrival of additional force, which he understood was on the way, captain Porter determined to put to sea the first opportunity that should present. A rendezvous was accordingly ap pointed for the Essex junior, and having ascertained by repeated trials that the Essex was a superior sail er to either of the blockading ships, it was agreed that she should let the enemy chase her off ; thereby giving the Essex junior an opportunity of escaping. On the next day, the 28th of March, the wind came on to blow fresh from the southward, and the Essex parted her larboard cable and dragged her"], [141, "133 NAVAL BATTLES. starboara ancnor directly out to sea. Not a moment was lost in getting sail on the ship ; but perceiving that the enemy was close in with the point form ing the west side of the bay, and that there was a possibility of passing to windward, and escaping to sea by superior sailing, captain Porter resolved to hazard the attempt. He accordingly took in his top gallant-sails and braced up for the purpose, but most unfortunately on rounding the point a heavy squall struck the ship and carried away her main-top-mast, precipitating the men who were aloft into the sea, who were drowned. Both ships now gave chase, and the crippled state of his ship left captain Porter no al ternative but to endeavour to regain the port. Find ing it imposible to get back to the common anchor age, he ran close into a small bay about three quar ters of a mile to leeward of the battery, on the east of the harbour, and let go his anchor within pistol shot of the shore. Supposing the enemy would, as formerly, respect the neutrality of the place, he con sidered himself secure, and thought only of repairing the damages he had sustained. The wary and men acing approach of the hostile ships, however, display ing their motto flags and having jacks at all their masts' heads, soon showed him the real danger of his situation. With all possible despatch he got his ship ready for action, and endeavoured to get a spring on his cable, but had not succeeded, when, at fifty four minutes past three p. m. the enemy commenced an attack."], [142, "134 NAVAL BATTLES. At first the Ph\u0153be lay herselfunder his stern and the Cherub on his starboard bow; but the latter soon finding herself exposed to a hot fire, bore up and ran under his stern also, where both ships kept up a severe and raking fire. Captain Porter succeeded three different times in getting springs on his cables, for the purpose of bringing his broadside to bear on the enemy, but they were as often shot away by the ex cessive sire to which he was exposed. He was ob liged, therefore, to rely for defence against this tre mendous attack merely on three long twelve pound ers, which he had ran out of the stern ports ; and which were worked with Such bravery and skill, as in half an hour to do great injury to both the enemy's ships, and induce them to hale off and repair dama ges. It was evidently the intention of commodore Hillyar to risk nothing from the daring courage of his antagonist, but to take the Essex at as cheap a rate as possible. All his man\u0153uvres were deliberate and wary ; he saw his antagonist completely at his mercy, and prepared to cut him up in the safest and surest manner. In the mean tiine the situation of the Essex was galling and provoking in the extreme ; crippled and shattered, with many killed and wound ed, she lay awaiting the convenience of the enemy, to renew the scene of slaughter, with scarce a hope of escape or revenge. Her brave crew, however, in place of being disheartened, were aroused to despera tion, and by hoisting ensigns in their rigging, and jacks in different parts of the ship, evinced their de-: fiance and determination to hold out to the last."], [143, "135 NAVAL BATTLES. The enemy having repaired his damages, now placed himself, with both his ships, on the starboard quarter of the Essex, out of reach of her carronades, and where her stern guns could not be brought to bear. Here he kept up a most destructive fire, which it was not in captain Porter's power to return ; the latter, therefore, saw no hope of injuring him with out getting under way and becoming the assailant. From the mangled state of his rigging, he could set no other sail than the flying jib ; this he caused to be hoisted, cut his cable, and ran down on both ships, with an intention of laying the Ph\u0153be on board. For a short time he was enabled to close with the enemy, and the firing on both sides was tremendous. The decks of the Essex were strewed with dead, and her cockpit filled with wounded ;. she had been several times on fire, and was in fact a perfect wreck ; still a feeble hope sprung up that she might be saved, in consequence of the Cherub being com pelled to hale off by her crippled state ; she did not return to close action again, but kept up a dis tant firing with her long guns. The disabled state of the Essex, however, did not permit her to take advantage of this circumstance ; for want of sail she was unable to keep at close quarters with the Ph\u0153be who, edging off, chose the distance which best suited her long guns, and kept up a tremendous fire, which made dreadful havock among our crew. Many of the guns of the Essex were rendered useless, and many had their whole crews destroyed \u2014 they were man ned from those that were disabled, and one gun in"], [144, "136 NAVAL BATTLES. particular was three times manned ; fifteen men were slain at it in the course of the action, though the captain of it escaped with only a slight wound. Captain Porter now gave up all hope of closing with the enemy, but finding the wind favourable, de termined to run his ship on shore, land the crew, and destroy her. He had approached within musket shot of the shore, and had every prospect of succeed ing, when, in an instant, the wind shifted from the land and drove her down upon the Ph\u0153be, exposing her again to a dreadful raking fire. The ship was now totally unmanageable ; yet as her head was toward the enemy, and he to leeward, captain Porter again perceived a faint hope of boarding. At this moment lieutenant Downes, of the Essex junior, came on board to receive orders, expecting that captain Por ter would soon be a prisoner. His services eould be of no avail in the deplorable state of the Essex, and finding from the enemy's putting his helm up, that the last attempt at boarding would not succeed, cap tain Porter directed him, after he had been ten min utes on board, to return to his own ship, to be prepared for defending and destroying her in case of attack. He took with him several of the wounded, leaving. three of his boat's crew on board to make room for them. The Cherub kept up a hot fire on him during his return. The slaughter on board of the Essex now became horrible ; the enemy continued to rake her, while she was unable to bring a gun to bear in return. Still her commander, with an obstinacy that bordered on desperation, persisted in the une-"], [145, "137 NAVAL BATTLES. qual and almost hopeless conflict. Every expedient that a fertile and inventive mind could suggest was resorted to, in the forlorn hope that they might yet be enabled by some lucky chance to escape from the grasp of the foe. A halser was bent to the sheet anchor, and the anchor cut from the bows, to bring the ship's head round. This succeeded ; the broadside of the Essex was again brought to bear ; and as the enemy Was much crippled and unable to hold his own, captain Porter thought she might drift out of gun shot before she discovered that he had anchored. The halser, however, unfortunately part ed, and with it sailed the last lingering hope of the Essex. The ship had taken fire several times during the action, but at this moment her situation was aw ful. She was on fire both forward and aft ; the flames were bursting up each hatchway ; a large quantity of powder below exploded, and word was given that the fire was near the magazine. Thus surrounded by horrours, without any chance of sav ing the ship captain Porter turned his attention to res cuing as many of his brave companions as possible. Finding his distance from the shore did not exceed three quarters of a mile, he hoped many would be able to save themselves should the ship blow up. His boats had been cut to pieces by the enemy's shot, but he advised such as could swim to jump overboard and make for shore. Some reached it \u2014 some were taken by the enemy, and some perished in the at tempt ; but most of this loyal and gallant crew pre- 18"], [146, "138 NAVAL BATTLES serred sharing the fate of their ship and their com mander. Those who remained on board now endeavoured to extinguish the flames, and having succeeded, went again to the guns and kept up a firing for a few min utes ; but the crew had by this time become so weak ened that all further resistance was in vain. Cap tain Porter summoned a consultation of the officers of divisions, but was surprised to find only acting lieutenant Stephen Decatur M'Knight remaining ; of the others some had been killed, others knocked overboard, and others carried below disabled by se vere wounds. The accounts from every part of the ship were deplorable in the extreme ; representing her in the most shattered and crippled condition, in imminent danger of sinking, and so crowded with the wounded that even the birth deck could contain no more, and many were killed while under the surgeon's hands. In the mean while the enemy, in consequence of the smoothness of the water and his secure dis tance, was enabled to keep up a deliberate and con stant fire, aiming with coolness and certainty as if firing at a target, and hitting the hull at every shot. At length, utterly despairing of saving the ship, cap tain Porter was compelled, at twenty minutes past six p. m. to give the painful order to strike the col ours. It is probable the enemy did not perceive that the ship had surrendered, for he continued firing ; several men were killed and wounded in different parts of the ship, and captain Porter thinking he in-"], [147, "139 SfAVAL BATTLES. ESSEX AND BRITISH FRIGATES IN THE HARBOUR OF VALPARAISO."], [148, "140 NAVAL BATTLES. tended to show no quarter, was about to rehoist his flag and to fight until he sunk, when the enemy de sisted his attack ten minutes after the surrender. The loss of the Essex is a sufficient testimony of the desperate bravery with which she was defended. Out of two hundred and fifty-five men which com prised her crew, fifty-eight were killed ; thirty-nine wounded severely ; twenty-seven slightly ; and thir ty-one missing, making in all one hundred and fifty four. She was completely cut to pieces, and so covered with the dead and dying, with mangled limbs, with brains and blood, and all the ghastly im ages of pain and death, that the officer who came on board to take possession of her, though accustom ed to scenes of slaughter, was struck with sickening horrour, and fainted at the shocking spectacle. Thousands of the inhabitants of Valparaiso were spectators of the battle, covering the neighbouring heights ; for it was fought so near the shore that some of the shot even struck among the citizens, who in the eagerness of their curiosity, had ventur ed down upon the beach. Touched by the forlorn situation of the Essex, and filled with admiration at the unflagging spirit and persevering bravery of her commander and crew, a generous anxiety ran throughout the multitude for their fate : bursts of delight arose when, by any vicissitude of battle, or prompt expedient, a chance seemed to turn up in their favour, and the eager spectators were seen to wring their hands, and uttered groans of sympathy, when the transient hope was defeated, and the gal-"], [149, "141 NAVAL BATTLES. lant little frigate once more became an unresisting object of deliberate slaughter. Though, from the distance and positions which the enemy chose, this battle was chiefly fought on our part by six twelve pounders only, yet great damage was done to the assailing ships. Their masts and yards were badly crippled, their hulls much cut up ; the Ph\u0153be, especially, received eighteen twelve pound shot below her water line, some three feet under water. Their loss in killed and wounded was not ascertained, but must have been severe ; the first lieutenant of the Ph\u0153be was killed, and captain Tucker, of the Cherub, was severely wounded. It was with some difficulty that the Ph\u0153be and the Essex could be kept afloat until they anchored the next morning in the port of Valparaiso. Much indignation has been expressed against com modore Hillyar for his violation of the laws of na tions, and of his private agreement with captain Porter, by attacking him in the neutral waters of Val paraiso. His cautious attack with a vastly superior force, on a crippled ship, which, relying on his for bearance, had placed herself in a most defenceless situation, and which for six weeks previous had of fered him fair fight, on advantageous terms, though it may reflect great credit on his prudence, yet certain ly furnishes no triumph to a brave and generous mind. Captain Porter and his crew were paroled, and permitted to return to the United States in the Es sex junior, her armament being previously taken out. On arriving off the port of New York, they were"], [150, "142 NAVAL BATTLES. overhaled by the Saturn razee, the authority of com modore Hillyar to grant a passport was questioned, and the Essex junior detained. Captain Porter then told the boarding officer that he gave up his parole, and considered himself a prisoner of war, and as such should use all means of escape. In consequence of this threat the Essex junior was ordered to remain all night under the lee of the Saturn, but the next morning captain Porter put off in his boat, though thirty miles from shore ; and, notwithstanding he was pursued by the Saturn, effected his escape, and landed safely on Long Island. His reception in the United States has been such as his great services and distinguished valour deserved. The various interest ing and romantick rumours that had reached this country concerning him, during his cruise in the Pa cifick, had excited the curiosity of the public to see this modern Sinbad. On arriving in New York his carriage was surrounded by the populace, who took out the horses, and dragged him, with shouts and acclamations, to his lodgings. THE ALLIGATOR. Towards the latter part of January, 1814, the United States schooner Alligator, mounting eight or ten guns, with a complement of forty men, was at tacked in Stono river (six miles south of the channel"], [151, "143 NAVAL BATTLES. os Charleston, S. C.) by six boats from the enemy's squadron off the mouth of the river, having on board one hundred and forty men, and succeeded in beat ing them off, after a warm action of thirty minutes, in which the enemy suffered very severely. The loss on board the Alligator was two killed and two wound ed. Great credit is due to her commander, sailing master Dent, and crew, for defeating a force so great ly superior in numbers. The Alligator was after wards lost in a severe gale, and twenty-three of her men drowned. CRUISE OF COMMODORE RODGERS. On the 18 th of February, commodore Rodgers arrived at Sandy Hook, off New York, after a cruise of seventy-five days, during which he captured a number of British merchant vessels, and narrowly escaped at different times, a very superior force of the enemy. PEACOCK AND EPERVIER. On the 29th of April, in latitude 27 47, longitude 80 9, the United States sloop of war Peacock, cap tain Warrington, of twenty guns and one hundred and sixty men, captured, after an action of forty-two"], [152, "144 NAVAL BATTLES. PEACOCK AND LE EPERVIER."], [153, "145 MAVAL BATTLES. minutes, the British brig Epervier of eighteen guns and one hundred and twenty-eight men, having on board one hundred and twenty thousand dollars in specie. The loss on board the Epervier was eight killed and thirteen wounded ; among the latter was her first lieutenant, who lost an arm and received a severe splinter wound on the hip. Not a man in the Peacock was killed, and only two wounded ; and the injury sustained by the vessel was so trifling that in fifteen minutes after the Epervier struck, she was ready for another action. When the enemy struck, he had five feet of water in his hold, his main-top-mast was over the side, his main boom shot away, his foremast cut nearly in two and tottering, his bowsprit badly wounded, and for ty-five shot holes in his hull, twenty of which were within a foot of his water line. By great exertions, the Epervier was got in sailing order in the course of the day. On the 1st of May, the Epervier arrived at Sa vannah ; and' on the 4th, the Peacock reached the same place, after having been separated from her prize and chased for four or five days by a superior force of enemy's vessels. The Peacock shortly sailed again, and arrived at New York toward the latter part of October, from a cruise of one hundred and forty-seven days, hav ing made fourteen prizes, valued at four hundred and ninety- four thousand two hundred and twenty-two dollars ; twelve of the prizes were burnt or sunk, and two made cartels for prisoners. 19"], [154, "146 NAVAL BATTLES. CRUISE OF THE WASP.\u2014 CAPTURE OF THE REIN DEER. On the 1st of May, the United States sloop of war Wasp, of eighteen guns and one hundred and seventy-three men, captain Blakely commander, sail ed from Portsmouth, N. H. on a cruise, and on the 28th of June, in latitude 48 36, longitude 11 15 after having made several captures, she fell in with engaged, and after an action of nineteen minutes, cap tured his Brittanick majesty's sloop of war Reindeer, William Manners, esquire, commander. The Rein deer mounted sixteen twenty-four pound carronades, two long six or nine pounders, and a shifting twelve pound carronade, with a complement on board of one hundred and eighteen men. She was literally cut to pieces in a line with her ports ; her upper works, boats and spare spars were one complete wreck, and a breeze springing up the' day after the action, her foremast went by the board ; when the prisoner? having been taken on board the Wasp, she was set on fire and soon blew up. The loss on board the Reindeer wa? twenty-three killed and forty two wounded, her captain being among the former. On board the Wasp five were killed and twenty-one wounded. More than one half of the wounded enemy were, in consequence.of the severity and extent of their wounds, put on board a Portuguese brig and sent to England. \u2014 The"], [155, "147 NAVAL BATTLES. loss of the Americans, although not as severe as that of the British, was owing, in a degree, to the prox imity of the two vessels during the action, and the extreme smoothness of the sea, but chiefly in repel ling boarders. On the 8th of July, the Wasp put into L'Orient, France, after capturing an additional number of priz es, where she remained until the 27th of August, when she again sailed on a cruise. On the 1st of September she fell in with the British sloop of war Avon, of twenty guns, commanded by captain Abuth not, and after an action of forty-five minutes, com pelled her to surrender, her crew being nearly all killed or wounded. The guns were then ordered to be secured, and a boat lowered from the Wasp in order to take possession of the prize. In the act of lowering the boat, a second enemy's vessel was dis covered astern and standing towards the Wasp. Captain Blakely immediately ordered his crew to their quarters, prepared every thing for action, and awaited her coming up. In a few minutes after, two additional sail were discovered bearing down upon the Wasp. Captain Blakely stood off with the ex pectation of drawing the first from its companions ; but in this he was disappointed. She continued to approach until she came close to the stern of the Wasp, when she haled by the wind, fired her broad side, (which injured the Wasp but trifling,) and re traced her steps to join her consorts. Captain Blake ly was now necessitated to abandon the Avon, which had by this time become a total wreck, and which"], [156, "148 NAVAL BATTLES. soon after sunk, the surviving part of her crew hav ing barely time to escape to the other enemy's ves sels. On board the Avon forty were killed and sixty wounded. The loss sustained by the Wasp was two killed and one wounded. The Wasp afterwards continued her cruise, mak ing great havock among English merchant vessels and privateers, destroying an immense amount of the enemy's property. From the 1st of May until the 20th of September, she had captured fifteen ves sels, most of which she destroyed. LOSS OF THE PRESIDENT. On the 14th of January, the frigate President, the command of which had been assigned to commodore Decatur, sailed from New York on a cruise. Owing to a mistake of the pilots, the ship, in going out, grounded on the bar, where she continued to strike heavy for an hour and a half. Several of her rudder braces being broken, and other material injury sus tained, commodore Decatur thought it advisable to return to port, which, however, he was prevented from doing by the strong westerly winds. Having succeeded in forcing her over the bar, he shaped his course along the shore of Long Island for fifty miles,"], [157, "149 NAVAL BATTLES. and then s. e. by e. At five o'clock, three ships were discovered ahead. The commodore passed two miles to the northward of them. At daylight he discovered four ships in chase, one on each quar- ter, and two astern, the leading ship being a razee, which commenced a fire upon the President, but without effect. At meridian he found that he in- creased his distance from the razee ; but the next ship astern, which was the Endymion, mounting fifty guns, twenty-four pounders, on the maindeck, had gained and continued to gain upon him considerably. All hands were occupied in lightening the ship by starting water cutting away anchors, throwing over- board provisions, cables, spars, boats, and every arti- cle that could be got at, and keeping the sails wet from the royals down. At three o'clock the enemy was joined by a brig, and was coming up with the Presi- dent rapidly. The Endymion had approached with- in gunshot, and commenced a fire with her bow guns, which was returned from the stern of the President. At five o'clock, she obtained a position on the star- board quarter, within half point blank shot, on which commodore Decatur could not bring either his stern or quarter guns to bear. He remained in this posi- tion for half an hour, hoping that the enemy would close with him on his broadside, in which case he had prepared his men to board. The enemy, how ever, kept his position, and every fire cut some of the sails and rigging of the President. In was now dusk, and commodore Decatur altered his course, for the purpose of bringing the enemy abeam ; and although"], [158, "150 NAVAL BATTLES. their ships astern were drawing up fast, he felt satis fied he should be able to throw his opponent out of the combat before they could come up ; and was not without hopes of escaping. The enemy, however, kept off at the same instant. They continued engag ed, steering south, with steering sails set, two hours and a half, when the Endymion was completely dis mantled, and dropped entirely out of the action. The other ships of the squadron being in sight and almost within gunshot, commodore Decatur was of course compelled to abandon her. He then resumed his former course, to avoid, if possible, the remainder of the squadron, which he continued till eleven o'clock. At this time two fresh ships of the enemy, the Pomone and Tenedos, came up. The Pomone opened her fire upon the larboard bow, within mus ket shot ; the Tenedos, about two cables length astern, taking a raking position on the quarter of the President. The other ships of the squadron, except the Endymion, were within gunshot. Thus situated with about one fifth of his crew killed and wounded, his ship crippled, and more than a four-fold force op posed to him, without a chance of escape left, com modore Decatur thought it his duty to surrender. The loss on board the President was twenty four killed and fifty-five wounded. Among the for mer were lieutenants Babbit, Hamilton and Howell. The loss of the enemy was not ascertained. The Endymion had on board in addition to her own crew, one lieutenant, one master's mate and fifty seamen, belonging to the Saturn, and when the action ceas-"], [159, "NAVAL BATTLES. 151 ed, was left motionless and unmanageable, until she bent new sails, rove new rigging, and fished her spars ; nor did she join the squadron till six hours after the action, and three hours after the surrender of the President. Commodore Decatur, and a part of his ctew were put on board the Endymion, and was carried to Ber muda. After remaining on the Island a few days, he was paroled, and sailed for the United States in the British frigate Narcissus. The ships, composing the squadron m this action, were the Majestic, Endymion, Pomone, Tenedos, and Dispatch. In his letter to the secretary of the navy, commo dore Decatur says, \" It is with emotions of pride I bear testimony to the gallantry and steadiness of every officer and man I had the honour to command on this occasion : and I feel satisfied, that the fact of their having beaten a force when equal to themselves, in the presence, and almost under the guns of so vastly superior a force, when, too, it was almost self evident, that, whatever their exertions might be, they must ultimately be captured, will be taken as evi dence of what they would have performed, had the force opposed to them been in any degree equal.\" CAPTURE OF THE CYANE AND LEVANT. On the evening of the 20th February, captain Stewart, of the United States frigate Constitution,"], [160, "152 NAVAL BATTLES. off the Island of Madeira, fell in with his Britan nick majesty's ships of war Cyane and Levant, when a spirited action commenced. \u2014 In forty minutes the Cyane struck her colours, being much cut up, and the Levant endeavoured to escape. The Constitu tion, after manning the prize, pursued the Levant ; and in half an hour came up with her, when she soon surrendered. The Levant mounted twenty-one guns, eighteen of which were thirty-two pound carronades, and her crew consisted of one hundred and sixty officers, sea men and marines, commanded by captain Douglass. Her loss in killed was twenty-three, and wounded sixteen. The Cyane mounted thirty-four guns, (twenty two thirty-two pound carronades, ten eighteen pound do. and two long nine pounders,) and her crew con sisted of one hundred and sixty-eight officers, seamen and marines, commanded by captain Falcon. Her loss in killed was twelve, and wounded twenty-six. The Constitution received but little injury ; her loss in killed was three, and wounded twelve. On the 9th of March the Constitution with her two prizes anchored off the Isle of May, (one of the Cape-de-Verd Islands.) \u2014 On the 10th she got under way, and made sail for St. Jago, where she anchor ed. On the 12th, captain Stewart discovered three British frigates standing for Port Praya ; and consid ering the little respect heretofore paid by British vessels to neutral waters, he deemed it expedient to get under way. Signals were accordingly made"], [161, "153 NAVAL BATTLES.

After contin uing the chase for three or four hours, they succeed ed in separating the Levant from the other vessels, when she tacked and stood for the harbour, her. com manding officer, lieutenant Ballard, hoping the neu trality of the port might protect him : but in this he was disappointed. For after anchoring in four fath om water, and within one hundred and fifty yards of the shore, he was wantonly attacked by the British frigates, (which had chased him in) when, finding all further resistance vain$ he was compelled to strike his colours. , On the 8th of April, the Cyane, commanded by lieutenant Hoffman, arrived in safety at New York ; and on the 15th of May captain Stewart arrived at the same place in the Constitution, after a cruise of about five months^-having heard of the ratification of a treaty of peace between Great Britain and Ameri ca about a fortnight previous to his arrival.

Minutes of the action between the United States frigate Consti- tution and his majesty's ships Cyane and Levant, on the 20th February, 1815. Commences with light breezes from the east, and cloudy weather. At one p. m. discovered a sail two points on the larboard bow \u2014 hauled up, and made sail in chase. At a quarter past one, made the sail to be a ship ; at three quarters past one, discovered another sail ahead ; made them out, at two, to be both ships, standing close hauled, with their starboard tacks on board ; at four, the weathermost ship made signals, and bore up for her consort, then about ten miles to leeward ; we bore up after her, and set low er top-mast, top-gallant and royal studding sails, in chase ; at half past four, carried away our main roy al-mast ; took in the sails, and got another prepared. At five, commenced firing on the chase from our two larboard bow guns ; our shot falling short, ceased fir ing : at half past five, finding it impossible to pre vent their junction, cleared ship for action, then about four miles from the two ships; and forty minutes past five, they passed within hail of each other, and hauled by the wind on the starboard tack, hauled up their courses, and prepared to receive us : at forty five minutes past five, they made all sail close hauled by the wind, in hopes of getting to windward of us . at fifty-five minutes past five, finding themselves dis appointed in their object, and we were closing with them fast, they shortened sail, and formed on a line of wind, about half a cable's length of each other : at six, having them under command of our battery,"], [164, "156 NAVAL BATTLES. hoisted our colours, which was answered by both ships hoisting English ensigns : at five minutes past six, ranged up on the starboard side of the sternmost ship, about three hundred yards distant, and com menced the action by broadsides, both ships returning our fire with great spirit for about fifteen minutes ; then the fire of the enemy beginning to slacken, and the great column of smoke collected under our lee, induced us to cease our fire to ascertain their posi tions and conditions : in about three minutes, the smoke clearing away, we found ourselves abreast of the headmost ship, the sternmost ship luffed up for our larboard quarter ; we poured a broadside into the headmost ship, and then braced aback our main and mizzen-top-sails, and backed astern under cover of the smoke, abreast- the sternmost ship, when the action was continued with spirit and considerable effect, until thirty-five minutes past six, when the enemy's fire again slackened and we discovered the headmost bearing up ; filled our topsails, shot ahead, and gave her two stern rakes ; we then discovered the sternmost ship wearing also; wore ship immediately after her, and gave her a stern rake \u2014 she luffed to on our starboard bows, and gave us her larboard broadside : we ranged up on her larboard quarter, within hail, and were about to give her our starboard broadside, when she struck her colours, fired a lee gun, and yielded. At fifty minutes past six, took possession of his map ship Cyane, captain Gordon Falcon, mourning thirty-four guns. At ei^ht, filled away after her"], [165, "157 NAVAL BATTLES. consort, which was still in sight to leeward. At half past eight, found her standing towards us, with her starboard tacks close hauled, with top-gallant sails-set, and colours flying. At five minutes past eight, ranged close along side to windward of her on opposite tacks, and exchanged broadsides \u2014 wore immediately under her stern, and raked her with a broadside : she then crowded all sail, and endeavour ed to escape by running \u2014 hauled on board our tacks, set spanker, and flying jib in chase. At half past nine, commenced firing on her from our starboard bow chaser; gave her several shot, which cut her spars and rigging considerably. At ten, finding she could not escape, fired a gun, struck her colours, and yielded. We immediately took possession of his majesty's ship Levant, honourable captain George Douglass, mounting twenty-one guns. At one a. m. the damages of our rigging were repaired, sails shift ed, and the ship in fighting condition.\" Minutes of the chase of the United States frigate Constitution, by an English squadron of three ships, from out the harbour of Port Praya, island of St. Jago: \u2014 Commences with fresh breezes and thick foggy weather. At five minutes past twelve, discovered a large ship through the fog, standing in for Port Praya. At eight minutes past twelve, discovered two other large ships astern of her, also standing in for the port. From their general appearance supposed them to be one of the enemy's squadrons, and from the"], [166, "158 NAVAL BATTLES. little respect hitherto paid by them to neutral waters, I deemed it most prudent to put to sea. The signal was made to the Cyane and Levant to get under way. At twelve minutes past twelve, with our top sails set we cut our cable and got under way, (when the Portuguese opened a fire on us from several of their batteries on shore) the prize ships following our mo tions, and stood out of the harbour of Port Praya, close under East Point, passing the enemy's squad ron about gunshot to windward of them ; crossed our top-gallant yards, and set foresail, mainsail, spank er, flying-jib and top-gallant sails. The enemy see ing us under way, tacked ship and made all sail in chase of us. As far as we could judge of their rates, from the thickness of the weather, supposed them two ships of the line and one frigate. At half pas twelve, cut away the boats towing astern \u2014 first cut ter and gig. At one p. m. found our sailing about equal with the ships on our lee quarter, but the frig ate luffing up, gaining our wake, and rather dropping astern of us ; finding the Cyane dropping astern and to leeward, and the frigate gaining on her fast, I found it impossible to save her if she continued on the same course, without having the Constitution brought to action by their whole force. I made the signal at ten minutes past one, to her to tack ship, which was complied with. This man\u0153uvre, I conceived, would detach one of the enemy's ships in pursuit of her, while at the same time, from her position, she would be enabled to reach the anchorage at Port Praya, be fore the detached ship could come up with her ; but"], [167, "NAVAL BATTLES. 159 if they did not tack after her, it would afford her an opportunity to double their rear, and make her escape before the wind. They all continued in full chase of the Levant and this ship ; the ship on our lee quarter firing broadsides, by divisions \u2014 her shot fall- ing short of us. At three, by our having dropped the Levant considerably, her situation became (from the position of the enemy's frigate) similar to the Cyane. It became necessary to separate also from the Levant, or risk this ship being brought to action to cover her. I made the signal at five minutes past three for her to tack, which was complied with. At twelve minutes past three, the whole of the enemy's squadron tacked in pursuit of the Levant, and gave up the pursuit of this ship. This sacrifice of the Levant became necessary for the preservation of the Constitution. Sailing master Hixon, midshipman Varnum, one boatswain's mate, and twelve men, were absent on duty in the fifth cutter, to bring the cartel brig under our stern. BLOCKADE OF CHESAPEAKE AND DELAWARE BAYS. The British government declared the Chesapeake and Delaware bays to be in a state of blockade. In the early part of the year, a sauadron under the"], [168, "160 NAVAL BATTLES. command of admiral Warren, was sent to the en trance of the Chesapeake to enforce this blockade. The first interesting event this blockade gave rise to, was the affair of the Lottery. This vessel mounted six guns, and had a crew of thirty-five men. In sailing out of the Chesapeake, in the month of February, she was attacked by nine large British boats, having on board two hundred and forty well armed men. She sustained their united attack up wards of an hour and a half, when the British suc ceeded in boarding her, and pulled down her colours. The loss of the British exceeded the number of the Lottery. On the 3d of April, the privateer Dolphin of Balti more, was captured after a long and gallant resist ance, by a number of barges and launches, belong ing to the blockading squadron. The British finally succeeded in capturing her, by boarding and over powering her crew by superior numbers. About the middle of May, a party of the British blockading squadron, sailed up to the head of the Chesapeake bay, where they captured and destroyed a number of small vessels. About the commencement of May, a large party of British marines and sailors, under the command of rear admiral Cockburn, successfully attacked the villages of Frenchtown, Havre-de-grace, Georgetown and Fredericktown. These places were situated near the head of the Chesapeake, and contained but few inhabitants. They of course could make but little resistance against a numerous body of assail-"], [169, "161 NAVAL BATTLES. ants. The destruction committed by the British in those places was wanton in the extreme. The hous es were set on fire. The furniture and other prop erty of the inhabitants were either destroyed or con veyed on board their vessels. The squadron soon after returned down the Chesapeake. On the 20th of June, commodore Cassin fitted out an expedition against some of the blockading frigates then in the vicinity of Crany Island. Fifteen gun boats were selected for this purpose and put under the command of captain Tarbell. The attack was com menced from the gun boats upon a frigate about three quarters of a mile distant. Two other British frig ates were in sight. The frigate sustained considera ble injury, and would have been captured by the gun boats had not a breeze sprung up which enabled the other two vessels to come to her assistance. The action however continued an hour and a half with the three frigates. Only one American was killed, and some others slightly wounded. On the 22d of June, about three thousand British attempted to land on Crany Island, but were repuls ed. Three of their barges were sunk : one of them, belonging to admiral Warren's ship had seventy-five men in her, the greater part of whom were drowned ; a number of prisonerswere taken. Many of the ene my also deserted. The American troops on the is land consisted of about five hundred land troops un der the command of lieutenant-colonel Beaty ; and one hundred and fifty marines, and sailors, under the 21"], [170, "162 NAVAL BATTLES. command of lieutenants Neale, Shubrick, Saunders, and Brackenridge. On the 25th of June, about two thousand five hundred British attacked the town of Hampton. The American force stationed there amounted to about four hundred, under the command of major Crutchfield. This small body of Americans opposed the very superior British force, with the utmost gal lantry for a considerable time, when, overcome by numbers, they retreated, and the British took posses sion of Hampton, where the most inhuman and shock ing acts were committed by them. Several of the de fenceless and unfortunate females that remained in the place suffered every indecency and violence. Pro perty to a large amount was most wantonly destroyed. On the 14th of July the United States schooner Asp, of three guns and twenty-one men, in the Ches apeake bay, being attacked by several British ves sels, ran up a creek, whither she was pursued by three boats, well manned and armed ; but the assail ants were soon compelled to retreat. After the lapse of an hour, the Asp was again attacked by five boats, the crews of which succeeded in boarding her. The crew of the Asp retreated on shore. The Brit ish set fire to the vessel and left her. The fire however was extinguished by the Americans. The loss of the latter in killed and wounded amounted to ten. On the 18th of July, an attempt was made in the Chesaneake >\u00ab>*', to blow up the Plantaganet, a se venty-four, by means of a torpedo. Mr. Mix, the"], [171, "163 NAVAL BATTLES. projector of the scheme, had approached within forty fathoms of her, and dropped the torpedo ; when he was hailed by one of the British guard boats. He instantly drew his machine into the boat and escaped. On the following night he,made a second attempt, but was again discovered. In the night of the 20th, he made a third attempt, and got within fifteen yards of the ship's bow, and directly under her jib boom, where he continued fifteen minutes making preparations, when a sentinel from the forecastle hailed \" Boat ahoy.\" The sentinel not being an swered, fired his musket at the now retreating ad venturer, to which a rapid discharge of small arms succeeded. Blue lights were resorted to in order to find out the position of the boat, but failed. Rockets were then thrown which illumined the water to a considerable extent, and discovered the boat. A heavy discharge of cannon immediately commenced. The Plantaganet slipped her cable, made some sail, while her boats were sent in pursuit. But the dar ing American escaped unhurt. Unsuccessful at tempts were made the three following nights. But on the 24th Mr. Mix took his position within one hundred yards of the Plantaganet, and in a direction with her larboard bow. The machine was dropped into the water, and the same moment the sentinel cried \" All's well :\" the tide swept it towards the vessel, but it exploded a few seconds too soon. A column of water fifty feet in circumference was thrown up thirty or forty feet. Its appearance was a vivid red, tinged with purple at the sides. The"], [172, "164 NAVAL BATTLES. ; limit of the column burst with a tremendous explo sion, and fell on the deck of the Plantaganet in tor rents, while she rolled into the yawning chasm be low, and nearly upset. She however received but little injury. In the month of July, the blockading squadron again sailed up the Chesapeake and entered the Po tomac : they however effected nothing. Soon after returning out of the river they sailed toward the head of the Chesapeake. They landed on Kent Island, where they remained for some time, when they again returned down the bay. On the 6th of April the blockading squadron in the Delaware bay commenced a cannonade on Lewis town, the inhabitants of which had refused comply ing with an order of the English commodore, to sup ply the squadron with provisions. The cannonade lasted about twenty- two hours : a number of eighteen and thirty-two pound shot were fired, likewise shells and Congreve rockets; but produced little or no effect \u2014 not a life was lost. The inhabitants of the place were prompt in repelling every attempt to land. On the 27th of July, one of the United States gun boats was captured in the Delaware by a superior force, after a very gallant defence, in which the British had seven men killed and twelve wounded.* * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 194\u2014197."], [173, "NAVAL BATTLES. 165 GUN BOAT ACTION On the 19th of May, commodore Lewis, command ing the United States flotilla on the New York sta tion, discovered the enemy in pursuit of a brig under American colours standing for Sandy Hook ; when he ordered a detachment of eleven gun boats to pro ceed to sea and pass between the chase and the en emy, by which means to bring him to action, and give opportunity to the chase to escape \u2014 all which was effected ; and the enemy, after receiving the fire of the boats bore away. On the 23d, commodore Lewis engaged the ene my, before New London, and opened a passage for forty sail of coasting vessels ; the action lasted three hours, in which the flotilla suffered very little, and night coming on, the action ceased. The enemy's force consisted of two ships and a sloop of war, and from appearance suffered severely, as he was unwill ing to renew the action next morning. EVENTS ON LAKE ERIE. On the morning of the 8th of October, 1812, two British vessels, the Detroit and the Caledonia, came down Lake Erie, and anchored under the guns of"], [174, "166 NAVAL BATTLES. the British fort Erie. Lieutenant Elliot, of the United States navy, who, at that time superintended the naval affairs on lake Erie, determined to attack, and if possible, to possess himself of them. About this time, a number of seamen were march ing from the sea shore to the lake. Early the day before the intended attack, he despatched a messen ger to hasten them forward. They arrived about twelve o'clock ; but he discovered that they had only twenty pistols, and neither cutlasses nor battleaxes. On application to general Smyth, he was supplied with a few arms : and about fifty men were detach ed from the regulars, armed with muskets. By four o'clock in the afternoon, lieutenant Elliot had his men selected and stationed in two boats, fifty in each. At one o'clock on the following morning; he put off from the mouth of Buffalo creek, under very disadvantageous circumstances, his men hav ing scarcely had time to refresh themselves after a fatiguing march of five hundred miles. At three o'clock he came along side the British vessels. In the space of ten minutes he got possession of them, had secured the crews as prisoners, and had them under way. The wind, unfortunately, was not sufficiently strong to carry them against a rapid current into the lake, where, he was informed, another vessel lay at anchor. He was obliged in running down the river, to pass the British forts, under a heavy fire of round, grape and cannister shot, from a number of pieces of heavy ordnance, and several pieces of flying artille ry. Lieutenant Elliot was compelled to anchor at"], [175, "167 NAVAL BATTLES. a distance of about four hundred yards from two of their batteries. After the discharge of the first gun he hailed the British officer, and observed to him, that if another gun were fired he would bring the prisoners on deck and expose them to the same fate with the Americans. But, notwithstanding they continued to keep up a constant and destructive fire a moment's reflection determined him not to com mit an act of such barbarity. The Caledonia had been beached in as safe a position as circumstances would admit of, under one of the American batteries at Black Rock. Lieutenant Elliot now brought all the guns of his vessel on her side next the enemy, and a fire was kept up until all his ammunition was expended. During the contest he endeavoured to get the De troit on the American side, but did not succeed. He then determined to drift down the river, out of reach of the British Batteries, and make a stand against their flying artillery. He accordingly ordered the cable to be cut, and made sail with a very light breeze. At this moment he discovered that his pi lot had abandoned him. He dropped astern for about ten minutes, when he was brought up on Squaw island, near the American shore. A boat with pri soners was sent on shore ; but, owing to the difficul ty it met with did not return. He, however, with the remainder of the prisoners and crew, succeeded in getting on shore. About eleven o'clock next morning, a company of British regulars from fort Erie, boarded the Detroit."], [176, "168 NAVAL BATTLES. to destroy the military stores with which she was prin cipally laden. But they were dislodged by a detach ment of volunteers under the command of major Cy renus Chapin. About three o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, the British a second time attempt ed to board the Detroit ; but were again repulsed. The Detroit mounted six long six pounders, and had a crew of fifty-six men. About thirty American prisoners were on board her. She was burnt by the Americans after they had taken the greater part of the stores out of her. The Caledonia mounted two small guns, and had a crew of twelve men. She had on board a cargo of furs, estimated at about one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. In March 1813, captain Perry arrived at the port of Erie, to take command of the fleet there fitting out. During the summer the following American ves- sels were equipped on lake Erie. Guns. Commanders. Brig Lawrence 20 O. H. Perry. Niagara 20 J. D. Elliot. Caledonia 3 Turner. Schr. Ariel 4 Packet.

Ship Detroit 19 2 Queen Charlotte 17 1 Schr. Lady Prevost 13 1 Brig Hunter 10 Sloop Little Belt 3 Schr. Chippeway 1 63 guns. On the morning of the tenth of September the British fleet was discovered by commodore Perry from Put in Bay, where he then lay at anchor. Commodore Perry immediately got under way with his squadron, and stood for the British fleet. The wind at that time was light from southwest. At fif teen minutes before twelve, the British commenced firing : and at five minutes before twelve, the action commenced on the part of the Americans. As the fire of the British, owing to their long guns, was very severe upon the Americans, and was principally di rected at the Lawrence, commodore Perry resolved to close with them : he accordingly made sail, and ordered the other vessels to follow. Every brace and bowline of the Lawrence being shot away, she became unmanageable, notwithstanding the great exertions of the sailing master. In this situation she sustained the action, within cannister distance, up wards of two hours, until every gun was rendered 22"], [178, "170 NAVAL BATTLES. useless, and the greater part of her crew either killed or wounded. After a display of skill and gallantry, which, alone, would have been sufficient to have immortalized commodore Perry \u2014 after defending his vessel against a far superior force, to the very last extremity, this illustrious hero, at a critical moment, when, to al most any other mind, the contest would have appear ed hopeless, resolved to save his country's honour, or perish in the attempt. He therefore quitted the Lawrence in an open boat, and rowed off for the Niagara, to make one more display of his heroism and talents. In his passage, there was no less than three broadsides fired at him by the British vessels, which he passed. Heaven interposed its protecting arm. He escaped the apparently inevitable destruc tion. He reached the Niagara in safety, and a breeze springing up, enabled captain Elliot, who commanded that vessel, to bring her into close action in a very gallant manner. Captain Elliot anticipated the com modore's desires by volunteering to bring the schoon ers, which had, by the lightness of the wind, been kept astern, into close action. Some time after com modore Perry had left the Lawrence her flag was lowered ; for having been so long exposed to nearly the whole fire of the British fleet, she was almost cut to pieces ; and the chief part of her crew disabled, only eight men remaining capable of doing duty. The British however were not in a state to take pos session of her, and circumstances soon permitted her flag to be again hoisted. At forty-five minutes past"], [179, "171 NAVAL BATTLES. two, the signal was made for close action. As the Niagara was very little injured, commodore Perry determined to pass through the enemy's line with her. He accordingly bore up, and passed ahead of their two ships and a brig, giving a raking fire to them from his larboard side, at half pistol shot dis tance. The smaller vessels were by this time with in grape and cannister distance, under the direction of captain Elliot. The severe and well directed fire from them and the Niagara, forced the two ships, the brig, and a schooner to surrender. A sloop and schooner attempted to escape, but were overtaken and captured. The Lawrence was so completely cut up, that after the action, she was sent to Erie to be disman tled. Lieutenant Yarnell, upon whom the command of the Lawrence devolved after the commodore left her, refused to quit the deck though several times wounded. Lieutenant Brooke of the marines, and midshipman Saul, were both killed on board the Lawrence. As the surgeon of this vessel was stoop ing, in the act of dressing or examining a wound, a ball passed through the ship a few inches from his head, which, had it been erect must have been tak en off. Mr. Hambleton, purser, distinguished him self, and towards the close of the action was severe ly wounded. \u00ab\u2022 On board the Niagara, lieutenants Smith and Ed wards and midshipman Webster behaved in a very handsome manner. Captain Brevoort of the army, who, with the men under his command, had volun-"], [180, "172 NAVAL BATTLES. teered, to act as marines, did great execution with his musketry. Lieutenant Turner, who command ed the Caledonia, brought his vessel into action in the most gallant style. The Ariel, lieutenant Pack et, and Scorpion, sailing master Champlin, got early into the action, and were of great service. The pur ser Magrath performed essential service. Captain Elliot particularly distinguished himself by his exer tion and skill. . The following is an estimate of the killed and wounded on board the American fleet. Killed. Wounded. Total.

The rejoicing at this victory in the United States, was extremely great. All the J^|ncipal towns were illuminated.* I * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 217\u2014222."], [181, "173 NAVAL BATTLES. EVENTS ON LAKE ONTARIO. For a long time previous to the war, the British had been actively employed in equipping vessels of war on lake Ontario. On the 19th of July 1812, soon after the declaration of war reached Sackett's harbour, lieutenant Woolsey, of the American brig Oneida, then lying in Sackett's harbour, discovered from the mast head five sail of British armed vessels namely, the Royal George, of twenty-four guns ; the Prince Regent, a new ship carrying upwards of twen- ty guns, the Earl Moira of twenty, the Seneca of eight, the other unknown. They were about five leagues distant, beating up for the harbour with the wind ahead. The troops were immediately called to arms and despatches sent for the troops in the vicini- ty, who assembled, to the amount of nearly three thousand. Soon after sunrise the Prince Regent brought to, and captured the custom house boat, about seven miles from the harbour. The crew of the boat were set on shore, with a message to colonel Belleyer, the commandant at the harbour, demand- ing the surrender of the Oneida, and the late British schooner Nelson, seized for a breach of the revenue laws, and then fitting out as an armed vessel. In case of refusal, the British threatened to burn the village, and lay theJnhabitants under contribution. Soon after this lieutenant Woolsey left the harbour in the Oneida, and ran down within a league of the British. But he soon returned, and moored his vessel j"], [182, "174 NAVAL BATTLES. in a line with a land battery lately erected. Lieu tenant Woolsey then left his vessel, in order to direct the guns of the land battery. By this time the Brit ish fleet had arrived within gunshot. The Royal George, as flag ship, was ahead. A brisk firing com menced on both sides, and continued upwards of two hours. The Royal George and Prince Regent were much injured. As the former was veering to give a broadside, a shot from an American thirty-two pound er, was observed to strike her and completely rake her. Soon after this the squadron bore away for Kingston. None of the Americans were injured. On the 31st of July, the Julia, carrying three guns was attacked by the British armed vessels Earl Moira, of sixteen guns, and the Duke of Gloucester of ten, at the entrance of the St. Lawrence, and beat them both off. In September, captain Isaac Chauncey was ap pointed to command the American fleet on lake On tario, then lying in Sackett's harbour, where he ar rived in the month of October. In the early part of November, he sailed with his fleet from Sackett's harbour : the aggregate of guns of the American ves sels amounted to forty, their crews to four hundred and thirty men ; that of the British to one hundred and eight guns, and their crews to eight hundred and ninety men. On the 8th, commodore Chauncey fell in with the Boyal George, and chased her into Quinte Bay ; where he lost sight of her in the night ; but on the morning of the 9th, she was perceived lying in"], [183, "175 NAVAL BATTLES. Kingston channel. She was immediately followed into the harbour of Kingston. He there engaged her while exposed to the fire of the land batteries, for upwards of an hour and a quarter. Night coming on he haled off with the intention of renewing the at tack next morning ; but this the weather prevented. On the 10th, the commodore fell in with the Gov ernor Simcoe, which however succeeded in escaping into the harbour of Kingston. In passing through the bay of Quinte, two British trading vessels were captured. On the 12th he returned to Sackett's harbour. On the 26th of November, the ship Madison was launched at Sackett's harbour. / In the spring of the year 1813, the United States had the following vessels equipped on lake Ontario Guns Ship Madison 24 Brig Oneida 18 Schooner Governor Tompkins 6 Hamilton 9 Julia 2 Elizabeth 2 Lady of the Lake 3 Conquest 8 Growler 5 Pert 3 Fair American '4 Ontario 1 Scourge 8 9^ t"], [184, "176 NAVAL BATTLES. Also the Mary, bombvessel. During the summer the General Pike of thirty-two guns, was added to the fleet. The British fleet in the spring consisted of the following vessels : Guns. The frigate General Wolfe 36 Ship Royal George 22 Prince Regent 16 Brig Earl Moira 12 Seven schooners of from four to eight guns each. On the 25th of April the American fleet, under commodore Chauncey, left Sackett's harbour for the purpose of conveying the expedition, under the com mand of major general Dearborn, against the British post at York. At this place the fleet arrived on the 27th. The landing of the troops was covered in a masterly manner by the commodore. The Ameri cans succeeded in their attack upon the town : but unfortunately, -the ever to be lamented brigadier general Pike, was killed by explosion. A midship man and some seamen of the fleet were killed. Commodore Chauncey, after having returned to Sackett's harbour from York, again sailed, on the 22d of May for the purpose of co-operating in the reduction of the British fort George, which was at tacked on the 28th. The vessels of the American squadron were judiciously stationed to cover the landing of the troops, and to silence the land batte ries of the British ; in the latter they soon succeed ed ; when a landing was effected, and the fort taken"], [185, "177 NAVAL BATTLES. Captain Perry had come down from lake Erie, and was in this engagement. He rendered particular service to the commodore by assisting in arranging and superintending the debarkation of the troops, On board the fleet only one man was killed, and two wounded. On the 29th of May, during the absence of the American fleet, the British fleet, consisting of the Wolfe, Royal George, Prince Regent, Earl Moira, two armed schooners, and a number of gun boats, with a detachment of the British army, from'Kings ton, attacked Sackett's harbour ; they were howev er gallantly repulsed by the troops under the com mand of brigadier general Brown. A few days after this affair the American fleet returned to Sackett's harbour. In the latter part of July, commodore Chauncey left Sackett's harbour with his fleet, and on the 27th of the same month arrived off Niagara. Having there taken about two hundred and fifty infantry on board, he set sail. It had been resolved to attack an encamp ment of the British ; but the latter being in greater force than had been supposed, the attempt was aban doned ; and the fleet proceeded to York, where the marines and soldiers were landed, under colonel Scott. A very considerable quantity of British stores were either destroyed or conveyed on board the fleet. The barracks and publick store houses were burnt. The fleet then returned to Niagara. On the 7th of August at daylight, the British fleet, consisting of two ships, two brigs, and two large 23"], [186, "178 NAVAL BATTLES. schooners, were discovered bearing w. N. w. 7 hey were about five or six miles distant, and the wi> I at west. Commodore Chauncey, having passed the lee ward of the British line, and abreast of their van i hip, the Wolfe, hoisted American colours ; and fired <\\ few guns to ascertain whether the British vessels \u00bb ould be reached by his shot. But discovering that they fell short, he wore and haled upon a wind on the starboard tack. The rearmost of the American schooners was then about six miles astern. The British wore in succession ; and haled upon a wind on the same tack ; but perceiving the Americans would be enabled to weather them upon the next tack, they tacked, and made all sail to the north ward. As soon as the rear vessels of the American squadron could reach the wake of the British, they tacked, and made, all sail in chase. In the afternoon the wind became very light, and towards night a calm succeeded. The American schooners used their sweeps all the afternoon, in endeavours to close with the British, but without success. Late in the afternoon commodore Chauncey made the signal of recall, and formed in close order. During the night, the wind was from the westward ; and after mid night squally. All hands were kept at quarters, and the vessels beat to windward, in expectation of gain ing the wind of the British. During the night the two best American schooners were upset, in a heavy squall of wind, and sunk. Only sixteen persons were saved from them ; all the rest perished. The names of the schooners were the Hamilton and Scourge,"], [187, "179 NAVAL BATTLES. mounting together nineteen guns. This accident gave the British a decided superiority. Commodore Chauncey expected .the British would take advan tage of this superiority ; and the more so as by a change of wind they were brought right to windward of him. He accordingly formed his line upon the lar board tack, and hove to. Soon after the British bore up and set studding sails, apparently with the inten tion of bringing the Americans to action. When they had approached within four miles, they brought to on the starboard tack. The Americans then wore, and brought to, on the same tack. Commodore Chauncey perceiving the British did not intend bring ing him to action, edged away towards the shore, in order to take advantage of the land breeze in the-af ternoon. It soon after became calm, when he direct ed his schooners to sweep up and engage the British. About noon a light breeze blew from the eastward. The commodore then took the Oneida in tow, and made sail towards the British. When the van of the American schooners was within one and a half or two miles of the rear of the British, the wind shift ed to the westward, which again brought the latter to windward ; when they bore up to the American schooners in order to cut them off, before they could be rejoined by commodore Chauncey. But the schooners succeeded in returning to their station. The British being thus foiled in their attempt upon the schooners, haled their wind, and hove to. Tie weather becoming very squally, commodore Chaui cey resolved to run in towards Niagara. The crel rs"], [188, "180 NAVAL BATTLES. of the squadron were nearly forty-eight hours at quarters. A detachment of one hundred and fifty soldiers was received on board the American fleet from Niagara, to act as marines. On the following morning the British fleet was discovered bearing north. The American commodore immediately weighed anchor, and stood for them. The winds were light and variable, and by twelve o'clock were quite calm. At five, a fresh breeze blew from the north ; the British fleet then bearing north, about four or five leagues distant. The vessels of the American fleet wore in succession, and haled upon a wind on the larboard tack. At sunset, the British bore n. w. by n. on the starboard tack. The wind changing towards the westward, the American com modore stood to the northward all night in order to gain the north shore. At daybreak he tacked to the westward, the wind having then changed to n. n. w. Soon after which he discovered the British fleet, bearing s. w. The commodore made all sail in chase with the Asp, Madison, and Fair American in tow. To his great disappointment, the wind about twelve o'clock changed to w. s. w. which again brought the British to windward. The commodore tacked to the northward ; but at three o'clock, the wind in clining to the north, he wore to south and west, and made signal for the fleet to make all sail. At four, the British bore s. s. w. The Americans steered after them. At five, the former were becalmed under the land, while the latter neared them very fast with a fine breeze from n. n. w. At six, the Americans"], [189, "181 NAVAL BATTLES. formed in line within four miles of the British ; the wind being then very light. At seven the wind chang ed to s. w. blew a fresh breeze. This placed the Brit ish to windward. The American commodore then tacked, and haled upon a wind on the larboard tack, under easy sail, the British standing after him. At nine in the evening, the British were within double gun shot of the rear of the Americans. They then wore to the southward. Commodore Chauncey stood to the north under easy sail, with his fleet formed in two lines : a part of the schooners formed the weather line. They were ordered to commence the fire upon the British as soon as the shot of the latter should take effect ; and, as they approached, to edge down upon the American line to leeward, pass through the intervals, and form to leeward. At half past ten, the British tacked, and stood after the Americans. At eleven o'clock the rear of the Amer ican line opened a brisk fire upon the British, , and in the course of fifteen minutes the fire became general along the weather line of the Americans. At half past eleven this line bore up, and passed to leeward, except the Growler and Julia. These two vessels tacked to the south, which brought the British be tween them and their commodore. The latter filled his main-topsail, and edged away two points to lead the British down ; this he did in order to engage them to greater advantage, and to lead them from the Growler and Julia. They however kept their wind until they separated these two last mentioned vessels from the rest of the American squadron. As"], [190, "182 NAVAL BATTLES. they passed the General Pike, a few shots were ex changed without doing any injury. While the British were in chase of the two schooners, the commodore tacked and stood after them until midnight when he was forced to give over the pursuit to rejoin his squadron, then to leeward. Their line was now formed on the starboard tack. The firing continued between the two American schooners and the Brit ish fleet until one o'clock, when the former were captured. Soon after this, the American fleet being nearly destitute of provisions, returned to Sackett's harbour. During a cruise in the early part of September, commodore Chauncey fell in with the British fleet and chased them all round the lake, when they put into Amherst bay, after having received considerable injury from the fire of the Americans. This bay was so little known to the American pilots, that they were unwilling to take the fleet in. Sir James Yeo, commander of the British fleet, had a superiority over the American commodore, both in guns and men. His vessel also sailed better than the Ameri can. Commodore Chauncey blockaded the British fleet in Amherst bay for four days, when the wind blowing heavy from the westward, they succeeded in getting into Kingston : upon which the commodore returned to Sackett's harbour, where he remained only a few hours, and on the 18th of September sailed for Niag ara, where he arrived on the 24th."], [191, "NAVAL BATTLES. 183 Commodore Chauncey having ascertained that the British squadron was in York bay, sailed from Niag- ara. On the 27th, in the evening, owing to the ex- treme darkness of the night a part of his squadron separated, and did not join him until next morning. On the same day, the British fleet was discovered under way in York bay. The American squadron sailed for them with three schooners in tow. But on the British perceiving the design of the Ameri- cans to engage them, they tacked, and stood out of the bay, the wind being then at east. The Ameri- can commodore formed his line, and ran down for their centre. As soon, however, as he had approach- ed within three miles, they made all sail to the south- ward. The vessels of the American squadron wore in succession, and stood on the same tack with the British, and edged down gradually in order to close. At ten, past meridian, the British perceiving the Americans closing fast with them, and that they must either risk an action, or suffer their two rear vessels to be cut off, they tacked in succession, begin- ning at the van, hoisted their colours, and commenc- ed a well directed fire at the Pike. This they did with a view to cover their rear ; and, while passing to leeward, to attack the rear of the Americans. This commodore Chauncey frustrated by bearing up in succession, with the line preserved, for the centre of the British, as soon as their leading ship, the Wolfe, had passed the centre of her line, and was abeam, of the American. This man\u0153uvre not only covered the American rear, but also threw the Brit-"], [192, "184 NAVAL BATTLES. ish in confusion. They immediately bore away ; but the Americans had closed so near as to be enabled to bring their guns to bear with effect, and in twen ty minutes after, the main and mizzen-topmast, and the main yard of the British frigate Wolfe, was shot away. This vessel immediately put before the wind, with all sail set upon her foremast. The American commodore made signal for the fleet to crowd all sail in pursuit : but as the Wolfe kept right before the wind, she was enabled to outsail the American squadron, and experienced no retardment from the loss of her main and mizzen-topmast. The Americans continued the chase until near three o'clock. The Pike, with the Asp in tow, kept with in point blank shot of the British during the chase, and sustained the whole of their fire. Prudence for bade any further pursuit on the part of the Americans. The Pike was much injured, owing to her being so long exposed to the fire of the whole British fleet. The most serious injury, however, she received from the bursting of a gun, which killed and wounded twenty-two men. The Governor Tompkins lost her foremast. The American fleet returned to Niagara. On the 2d of October, commodore Chauncey again proceeded in quest of the British fleet. He discover ed them steering a course for Niagara, with studding sails, and all sails set, the wind being from the south and westward. The commodore made all sail in chase, but as soon as his vessels were discovered by the British, they took in studding sails and haled upon a wind to the westward, and made all sail from"], [193, "185 NAVAL BATTLES. r the Americans. The wind being light all day, little progress was made against the current. By sun down, the British were off Twenty Mile Creek, and had got a considerable distance from the Americans. At daylight, the British were perceived at anchor . but as soon as they saw the American squadron, they weighed and made all sail to the west. The wind was from south to southwest and squally. The American commodore made all sail in chase, and continued it the whole day. At sundown, the British could scarcely be perceived from the mast head of the American vessels. On the following morning the British fleet was outof sight. Commodore Chauncey then steered for the Ducks, with a view of intercept ing the British fleet on its return, should it have gone down the lake. The wind increased to a strong gale from the northward and westward, and contin ued during the whole day. At three o'clock in the afternoon of the 5th, seven sail were discovered near the False Ducks. Sail was immediately made in chase by the American commodore, who took them for the British fleet. But in the course of an hour he ascertained them to be sloops and schooners. Sig nal was made by the commodore for the Sylph and Lady of the Lake to cast off the vessels they had in tow, and chase n. e. Soon after this the British were perceived separating on different tacks. The Governor Tompkins was now cast off by the Pike, and the commodore made all sail in chase with her, having left the American squadron in charge of captain Crane. At five o'clock in the afternoon the 24"], [194, "186 NAVAL BATTLES. British set fire to one of their gun vessels that did not sail well, after having taken out her people. At sun down, and opposite the Real Ducks, the Hamilton, Confiance,* and Mary- Ann, struck to the Americans. The Sylph soon after captured the Drummond. The Lady Gore ran into the Ducks, but the Sylph being left to watch her, she was captured early the next morning. The only British vessel that escaped was the Enterprise, a small schooner. The British vessels captured were three gun vessels mounting from one to three guns each. They were trans porting troops to Kingston. The number of prison ers amounted to two hundred and sixty-four, of whom two hundred and twenty-two were soldiers. The American fleet immediately after this affair, re turned to Sackett's harbour.f * The Hamilton and Confiance; these two vessels had not long been captured from the Americans, as already related, and had been in the American service called the Growler and Julia. t Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 222\u2014232"], [195, "187 NAVAL BATTLES. EVENTS ON LAKE CHAMPLAIN. During the summer of the year 1812, prepara tions were made on lake Champlain to oppose the naval force that might be sent by the British from Isle-au-Noix. Nothing very interesting occurred until the 3d of June, 1813. In consequence of some British gun boats having appeared on the American side of the line, the Growler and Eagle sailed from Plattsburgh on the 2d of June, under the command of lieuten ant Smith, with the intention of attacking them. At dark on the same day, they arrived within a mile of the boundary line. On the following morning, at daybreak, three British gun boats were discovered, to which the American vessels immediately gave chase. But the wind being south, they unfortu nately ran so far into the narrow channel, that they found it difficult to return. The Eagle not being sufficiently strong for her weight of metal, became unmanageable, and sunk in shoal water ; her crew were however saved. The Growler continued en gaged with a number of British gun boats until the Eagle went down, when she was compelled to yield to a superior force ; the action continued above four hours. The shores were lined with British soldiers who from the narrowness of the channel were ena bled to do considerable execution."], [196, "188 NAVAL BATTLES. About the commencement of August the British in two large sloops of war, three gun boats, and about forty batteaux full of troops crossed the line. They landed at Plattsburgh, where they destroyed all the public buildings and stores. After which they aban doned the place.

On the 31st of August 1814, the advance of the British army under general Brisbane, entered Cham plain, and encamped on the north side of the Great Chazy river, and on the same day major general * Clark's Naval History, vol. i. p. 232, 233. >"], [197, "189 NAVAL BATTLES. Mooers ordered out the militia of the counties of Clinton and Essex. The regiment from Clinton county, under lieutenant-colonel Miller, immediately assembled, and on the 2d September took a position on the west road near the village of Chazy ; and on the 3d general Wright with such of his brigade as had arrived, occupied a position on the same road about eight miles in advance of Plattsburgh. On the 4th the enemy having brought up his main body to Cham- plain, took up his line of march for that place. The rifle corps under lieutenant-colonel Appling, on the lake road, fell back as far as Dead Creek, blocking up the road in such manner as to impede the advance of the enemy as much as possible. The enemy ad- vanced on the 5th within a few miles of lieutenant- colonel Appling's position, and finding it too strong to attack, halted and caused a road to be made west into the Beekmantown road, in which the light bri- gade under general Powers advanced, and on the morning of the 6th, about seven o'clock, attacked the militia, which had at this time increased to near- ly seven hundred, under general Mooers, and a small detachment of regulars under major Wool, about se- ven miles from Plattsburgh. After the first fire, a considerable part of the militia broke and fled in every direction. Many, however, manfully stood their ground, and, with the small corps of major Wool, bravely contested the ground, against five times their number, falling back gradually and occupying the fences on each side the road, till they arrived within a mile of the town, when they were reinforced by"], [198, "190 NAVAL BATTLES. two pieces of artillery, under captain Leonard, and our troops occupying a strong position behind a stone wall, for some time stopped the progress of the enemy : being at length compelled to retire, they contested every inch of ground until they reached the south bank of the Saranac, where the enemy at tempted to pursue them but was repulsed with loss. The loss of the British in this skirmish was colonel Wellington and a lieutenant of the third Buffs, and two lieutenants of the fifty-eighth killed, and one cap tain and one lieutenant of the fifty-eighth light com pany wounded, together with about one hundred pri vates killed and wounded ; while that on our part did not exceed twenty-five. The corps of riflemen un der colonel Appling, and detachment under captain Sproul, fell back from their position at Dead Creek in time to join the militia, &c. just before they en tered the village, and fought with their accustomed bravery. The British got possession of that part of the village north of the Saranac about eleven o'clock, but the incessant and well directed fire of our artillery and musketry from the forts and opposite bank com pelled them to retire before night beyond the reach of our guns. The enemy arrived towards night with his heavy artillery and baggage on the lake road and crossed the beach, where he met with a warm re ception from our row-galleys, and it is believed suf fered a heavy loss in killed and wounded. On our side, lieutenant Duncan, of the navy, lost an arm by a rocket and three or four men were killed by the enemy's artillery. The enemy encamped on the"], [199, "191 NAVAL BATTLES. ridge west of the town, his right near the river, and occupying an extent of nearly three miles, his left resting on the lake about a mile north of the village. From the 6th, until the morning of the 11th, an al most continual skirmishing was kept up between the enemy's pickets and our militia stationed on the ri ver ; and in the mean time both armies were busily engaged \u2014 ours in strengthening the works of the forts, and that of the enemy in erecting batteries, collecting ladders, bringing up his heavy ordnance, and making other preparations for attacking the fort. On the morning of the 7th, a body of the enemy under captain Noadie, attempted to cross at the up per bridge, about seven miles west of Plattsburgh, but were met by captain Vaughan's company of about twenty-five men, and compelled to retire with the loss of two killed and several wounded. On the morning of the 11th, the enemy's fleet came round the head with a light breeze from the north, and at tacked ours, which lay at anchor in Cumberland bay, two miles from the shore, east of the fort. The ac tion was long and bloody, but decisive ; and the event such as we believe it will always be (except by accident) when our navy contends with any thing like an equal force. The enemy commenced a simul taneous bombardment of our works from seven bat teries, from which several hundred shells and rockets were discharged, which did us very little injury, and our artillery had nearly succeeded in silencing all before the contest on the lake was decided. The enemy attempted at the same time to throw his main"], [200, "192 NAVAL BATTLES body in rear of the fort, by crossing the river three miles west of the town, near the scite of Pike's can tonment. He succeeded, in crossing, after a brave resistance by the Essex militia and a few of the Ver mont volunteers, in all about three hundred and fifty, stationed at that place, who retired back a mile and a half from the river, continually pouring in upon them an incessant fire from behind every tree, until lieuten ant Sumpter brought up a piece of artillery to their support, when the enemy commenced a precipitate retreat. The Vermont volunteers, who had hasten ed to the scene of action on the first alarm, fell upon the enemy's left flank and succeeded in making many prisoners, including three officers. Had the British remained on the south side of the river thir ty minutes longer, they must have lost nearly the whole detachment that crossed. Our loss in this af fair was five killed and eight or ten wounded, some mortally. Immediately on ascertaining the loss of the fleet, Sir George Prevost ordered preparations to be made for the retreat of the army, and set off himself with a small escort, for Canada, a little after noon. The main body of the enemy, with the ar tillery and baggage, were taken off in the afternoon and night, and the rear guard, consisting of the light brigade, started at daybreak, and made a precipitate retreat, leaving their wounded and a large quantity of provisions, fixed ammunition, shot, shells and other public stores in the different places of deposit about their camp. They were pursued some distance by our troops, and many prisoners taken ; but owing \u2022"], [201, "193 NAVAL BATTLES. to the very heavy and incessant rain, we were com pelled to return. The enemy lost, upon land, more than two thousand men in killed, wounded, prisoners and deserters ; while our aggregate loss did not ex ceed one hundred and fifty.* In September, 1814, commodore Macdonough succeeded in capturing the British fleet, the particu lars of which will be best related in his letter to the secretary of the navy, which follows. United States ship Saratoga, Plattsburgh Bay, September 13, 1814. SiB, \u2014 I have the honour to give you the particu lars of the action which took place on the 11th in stant on this lake. For several days the enemy were on their way, to Plattsburgh by land and water ; and it being well understood that an attack would be made at the same time by their land and naval forces, I determined to await at anchor the approach of the latter. At eight, a. m. the look-out boat announced the approach of the enemy. At nine he anchored in a line ahead, at about three hundred yards distance from my line ; his ship opposed to the Saratoga, his brig to the Eagle, captain Robert Henley, his galley (thirteen in number) to the schooner, sloop, and a division of our galleys. Our remaining galleys with the Saratoga and Eagle. In this situation, the whole force on both sides became engaged ; the Saratoga suffered much from * Sketches of the War, p 405 \u2014 407 25"], [202, "194 NAVAL BATTLES. the heavy fire of the Confiance : I could perceive, at the same time, however, that our fire was very de structive to her. The Ticonderoga, lieutenant-com mandant Cassin, gallantly sustained her full share of the action. At half past ten o'clock, the Eagle, not being able to bring ner guns to bear, cut her ca ble and anchored in a more eligible position, between my ship and the Ticonderoga, where she very much annoyed the enemy, but unfortunately leaving me exposed to a galling fire from the enemy's brig. Our guns on the starboard side, being nearly all dismount ed, or not manageable, a stern anchor was let go, the bower cable cut, and the ship winded with a fresh broadside on the enemy's ship, which soon af ter surrendered. Our broadside was then sprung to bear on the brig, which surrendered in about fif teen minutes after. The sloop that was opposed to the Eagle, had struck some time before, and drifted down the line ; the sloop which was with their galleys having struck also. Three of their galleys are said to be sunk, and the others pulled off. Our galleys were about obeying with alacrity the signal to follow them, when all the vessels were reported to me to be in a sinking state : it then became necessary to annul the signal to the galleys, and order their men to the pumps. I could only look at the enemy's galleys going off in a shattered condition, for there was not a mast in eith er squadron that could stand to make sail on ; the lower rigging, being nearly all shot away, hung down as though it had been just placed over the mast heads."], [203, "195 NAVAL BATTLES. The Saratoga had fifty five round shot in her hull ; the Confiance one hundred and five. The enemy's shot passed principally just over our heads, as there were not twenty whole hammocks in the nettings at the close of the action, which lasted, without inter mission, two hours and twenty minutes. The absence and sickness of lieutenant Raymond Perry, left me without the services of that excellent officer; much ought fairly to be attributed to him for his great care and attention in disciplining the ship's crew, as her first lieutenant. His place was filled by a gallant young officer, lieutenant Peter Gamble, who, I regret to inform you, was killed early in the action. Acting lieutenant Valette work ed the 1st and 2d divisions of guns with able effect. Sailing-master Brum's attention to the springs, and in the execution of the order to wind the ship, and occasionally at the guns, meets my entire approba tion ; also captain Young, commanding the acting marines, who took his men to the guns. Mr. Beale, purser, was of great service at the guns, and in car rying my orders throughout the ship, with Midship man Montgomery. Master's mate Joshua Justin, had command of the 3d division ; his conduct during the action, was that of a brave and correct officer. Midshipmen Monteath, Graham, Williamson, Platt, Thwing, and acting midshipman Baldwin, all behav ed well, and gave evidence of their making valuable officers. The Saratoga was twice set on fire by hot shot from the enemy's ship."], [204, "196 NAVAL BATTLES.

The British officers killed, were commodore Dow ney, and three lieutenants. The American officers killed, were lieutenants Gamble and Stansbury ; the latter of whom was knocked overboard and not found. Commodore Macdonough escaped without injury. The British officers taken were captain Pring and six or eight lieutenants. The wounded were parol ed and sent by a flag to the Isle-au-Noix. The British large ship proved to be a very fine vessel of her class, having two gun decks in her bow and stern, and mounting, among her guns, twenty eight long twenty-four pounders, a battery which few frigates of the British navy can boast. On the 13th of September, the interment of the American and British officers, w ho fell in the memo rable battle of the 11th, took place at Plattsburgh, in a manner to do honour to the bravery with which they defended they respective flags. The coffins of the American officers, covered with the flags of their vessels, were taken on board a boat from the com modore's ship and followed by him and his offi cers, in another boat, to the British ship, where they took on board the deceased British officers, covered with the flags of their own vessels, and proceeded to the shore, followed by their surviving officers, During the procession, minute guns were fired from the commodore's ship. At the land they were received by an escort of infantry and artillery; and joined by a large number of the officers of the army ; and while they proceed-"], [206, "198 NAVAL BATTLES. ed to the public burying ground, minute guns were also fired from the fort. At the grave, a discharge of musketry and artillery closed the scene. The following amount of property was said to have been taken from on board the enemy's fleet, at the time of, and subsequent to its capture : \u2014 seventeen thousand weight of powder, exclusive of fixed am munition for the ships ; between eighty and ninety thousand weight of balls, &c. ; six hundred muskets ; six hundred suits of sailor's clothing ; and the winter clothing for the whole of the land army. In the beginning of November, six tons of eight inch shells were taken out of the lake at Chazy by the Americans, which had been secreted by the ene my in his incursion. A transport sloop was also raised at Isle la Mott, which had been sunk by the enemy, loaded with naval stores and various instru ments of war ATTACK ON BALTIMORE. On Saturday the 10th of September, information was received that the enemy was ascending the Chesapeake, and on Sunday morning his ships were seen at the mouth of the Patapsco river, (which com municates with the basin on which Baltimore stands) in number to forty to fifty. Some of his vessels en-"], [207, "199 NAVAL BATTLES. tered the river, while others proceeded to North Point, (at the mouth of the Patapsco,) fourteen miles from Baltimore, and commenced the debarkation of their troops in the night, and was finished early next morning. The following extracts of a letter from general Smith to the secretary of war, gives an ac count of the events which followed : \" Baltimore, September 19, 1814 \"I have the honour of stating, that the enemy landed between seven and eight thousand men on Monday the 10th instant, at North Point, fourteen miles distant from this town. Anticipating this de barkation, general Strieker had been detached on Sunday evening with a portion of his brigade on the North Point road. Major Randel, of the Baltimore county militia, having under his command a light corps of riflemen and musketry taken from general Stanbury's brigade and Pennsylvania volunteers, was detached to the mouth of Bear Creek, with orders to co-operate with general Strieker, and to check any landing which the enemy might attempt in that quar ter. On Monday, brigadier general Strieker took a good position at the junction of the two roads leading from this place to North Point, having his right flanked by Bear Creek, and his left by a marsh. He here awaited the approach of the enemy, having sent on an advance corps under the command of major Heath of the 5th regiment. This advance was met by that of the enemy, and after some skir mishing it returned to the line, the main body of the"], [208, "200 NAVAL BATTLES. enemy being at a short distance in the rear of their advance. Between two and three o'clock, the ene my's whole force came up and commenced battle by some discharges of rockets, which were succeeded by the cannon from both sides, and soon after the action became general along the line. General Strieker gallantly maintained his ground against a great supe riority of numbers during the space of an hour and twenty minutes, when the regiment on his left (the fifty-first) giving way, he was under the necessity of retiring to the ground in his rear, where he had sta tioned one regiment as a reserve. He here formed his brigade ; but the enemy not thinking it advisable to pursue, he, in compliance with previous arrange ments, fell back and took post on the left of my in trenchments, and a half mile in advance of them. \" In this affair the citizen soldiers of Baltimore, with the exception of the fifty-first regiment, have maintained the reputation they so deservedly acquir ed at Bladensburg, and have given their country and their city an assurance of what may be expected from them when their services are again required. I cannot dismiss the subject without expressing the heartfelt satisfaction I \u2022 experience in thus bearing testimony to the courage and good conduct of my fellow townsmen. About the time general Strieker had taken the ground just mentioned, he was joined by brigadier general Winder, who had been stationed on the west side of the city, but was now ordered to march with general Douglass' brigade of Virginia militia and the United States dragoons under captain"], [209, "201 NAVAL BATTLES. Bird, and take post on the left of general Strieker. During these movements, the brigades of generals Stansbury and Foreman, the seamen and marines under commodore Rodgers, the Pennsylvania volun teers under colonels Corbeau and Findley, the Balti more artillery under colonel Harris, and the marire artillery under captain Stiles, manned the trenches and the batteries \u2014 all prepared to receive the enemy. We remained in this situation during the night. \" On Tuesday, the enemy appeared in front of my intrenchments, at the distance of two miles, on the Philadelphia road, from whence he had a full view of our position. He man\u0153uvred during the morning towards our left, as if with the intention of making a circuitous march, and coming down on the Hart ford and York roads. Generals Winder and Strieker were ordered to adapt their movements to those of the enemy, so as to baffle this supposed intention. They executed this order with great skill and judg ment, by taking an advantageous position, stretching from my left across the country, when the enemy was likely to approach the quarter he seemed to threaten. This movement induced the enemy to concentrate his forces (between one and two o'clock) in my front, pushing his advance to within a mile o us, driving in our videttes, and showing an intention of attacking us that evening. I immediately drew generals Winder and Strieker nearer to the left of my intrenchments, and to the right of the enemy, with the intention of their falling on his right or rear, should he attack me ; or if he declined it, of attack- 26"], [210, "202 NAVAL BATTLES. ing him in the morning. To this movement and to the strength of my defences, which the enemy had the fairest opportunity of observing, I am induced to attribute his retreat, which commenced at half past one o'clock on Wednesday morning. In this he was so favoured by the extreme darkness and a continued rain, that we did not discover it until daylight. I consented to general Winder's pursuing with the Vir ginia brigade and the United States dragoons ; at the same time major Randal was despatched with his light corps in pursuit of the enemy's right, whilst the whole of the militia cavalry was put in motion for the same object. All the troops were, however, so worn out with continued watching, and with being under arms during three days and nights, exposed the greater part of the time to very inclement weather, that it was found impracticable to do any thing more than pick up a few stragglers. The enemy com menced his embarkation that evening, and completed it the next day at one o'clock. It would have been impossible, even had our troops been in a condition to act offensively, to have cut off. any part of the enemy's rear guard during the embarkation, as the point where it was effected was defended from our approach by a line of defences extending from Back river to Humphrey's Creek on the Patapsco, thrown up by ourselves previous to their arrival. \" I have now the pleasure of calling your atten tion to the brave commander of fort M'Henry* major Armstead, and to the operations confined to that * Fort M'Henry is about two miles from the city of Baltimore."], [211, "203 NAVAL BATTLES. quarter. The enemy made his approach by water at the same time that his army was advancing on the land, and commenced a discharge of bombs and rock ets at the fort as soon as he got within range of it. The situation of major Armstead was peculiarly trying \u2014 the enemy having taken his position at such a distance as to render offensive operations on the part of the fort entirely fruitless, while their bombs and rockets were every moment falling in and about it\u2014 the officers and men being at the same time en tirely exposed. The vessels, however, had the temer ity to approach somewhat nearer \u2014 they were as soon compelled to withdraw. During the night, whilst the enemy on land was retreating, and whilst the bombardment was the most severe, two or three rocket vessels and barges succeeded in getting up the Ferry Branch ; but they were soon compelled to retire, by the forts in that quarter, commanded by lieutenant Newcomb of the navy, and lieutenant Webster of the flotilla. These forts also destroyed one Of the barges, with all on board. The barges and battery at the Lazaretto, under the command of lieutenant Rutter of the flotilla, kept up a brisk and it is believed a successful fire during the hottest period of the bombardment. The loss in fort M'Henry was four killed and twenty-four wounded, amongst the former I have to lament the fall of lieutenants Cla gett and Clamm, who were both estimable citizens and useful officers. Of general Strieker's brigade, the number of killed and wounded amounts to about one hundred and fifty"], [212, "204 NAVAL BATTLES. among the former this city has to regret the loss of its representative in the state legislature, James Lowry Donaldson, esquire, adjutant of the twenty seventh regiment. This gentleman will ever be re membered by his constituents for his zeal and talents, and by his corps for his bravery and military know ledge. \" I cannot conclude this report without informing you of the great aid I have derived from commodore Rodgers. He was ever present and ever ready to afford his useful counsel, and to render his important services. His presence, with that of his gallant offi cers and seamen, gave confidence to every one. \" The enemy's loss, in his attempt on Baltimore, amounts, as near as we can ascertain, to between six and seven hundred killed, wounded and missing.\" BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS. On the 27th December 1814, general Jackson ai. rived at New Orleans with his army, where he im mediately began the inspection of the different forts and works down the Mississippi river. On the morning of the 1st of January, the enemy had ad vanced within six hundred yards of our breast-works, under cover of night and a heavy fog, and erected three different batteries, mounting in all fifteen guns,"], [213, "205 NAVAL BATTLES. from 6's to 32's. About eight o'clock, when the fog cleared off, they commenced a most tremendous fire, which was amply returned by our men, and a heavy cannonading was kept up, without the least interval on either side, except that occasioned by the explo sion of two small magazines, owing to their coh greve rockets. At four o'clock, p. m. we had dis mounted all their guns but two. During the night the enemy retreated to their strong holds, about a mile and a quarter from our lines. Our loss was eleven killed and twenty-three wounded : that of the enemy must have been much more. A 32 pound er from a battery commanded by commodore Pat terson, killed fifteen at one shot. The Louisiana this day fired seven hundred shot. On the 2d of January, general Jackson received at New Orleans and its vicinity, reinforcements from Kentucky and Tennessee, amounting to three or four thousand, which, with his former force, gave him an army of between seven and eight thousand, of whom not more, however, than one half were armed. In consequence of the great number of men arriving with their arms in bad order, and of the scarcity of good muskets with bayonets, four companies of Unit ed States troops gave up theirs, amounting to about five hundred, to arm the men at the camp, and armed themselves with fowling pieces and pikes. On the 6th of January sailing-master Johnson of the United States navy, with a launch and three small boats, manned with thirty-eight men, succeed ed in burning a British transport brig on Lake"], [214, "206 NAVAL BATTLES. Borgne, and in capturing a number of prisoners. The brig was laden with provisions and clothing. On the same day, twenty-one sail of British vessels arrived off Cat island, upon the coast opposite the bay of St. Louis, with a large reinforcement of troops, commanded by general Lambert. On the 7th, these troops were disembarked at the bayou Bienvenu : and lieutenant-general sir Edward Pakenham, (broth er-in-law of lord Wellington) assumed command of the whole British army, amounting to twelve thou sand men. For two or three days previous to this, part of the forces of the enemy had been employed in preparing scaling ladders and collecting fascines (made of su gar canes) for their intended assault upon our lines ; while others were widening and deepening the canal which leads from the bayou Bienvenu towards the Mississippi, and which, on the evening of the 7th, was cut through to admit the river. Through this canal they floated or dragged twenty-four of their smaller boats, containing twenty-five men each, and thus transported about six hundred men to the op posite side of the river. Some distance above the spot where they landed, two batteries had been con structed and placed under the direction of commo dore Patterson. The enemy's troops which had thus crossed, were intended to attack the commodore's batteries and create a diversion on that side of the river, while the main attack was carried on on the other side. Accordingly on the morning of the 8th, they silently drew out a large force to storm our"], [215, "207 NAVAL BATTLES. lines, their columns advancing unperceived in the ob scurity of the morning, to within about half a mile of our camp, where they met and drove in our piquet guard. About day-break they advanced with great vivacity to the entrenchment, led gallantly on by their officers ; when the intrepid Jackson and his brave men opened a most tremendous and deadly fire upon them from our works, which ended in a dreadful slaughter and total defeat of the enemy. General Jackson officially reports to the secretary at war an account of this battle in the following words : \u2014 Camp, 4 miles below Orleans, January 9, 1815 Sib, \u2014 During the days of the 6th and 7th, the enemy had been actively employed in making prepar ations for an attack on my lines. With infinite la bour they had succeeded on the night of the 6th in getting their boats across the lake to the river, by widening and deepening the canal on which they had effected their disembarkation. It had not been in my power to impede these operations by a general attack ; added to other reasons, the nature of the troops under my command, mostly militia, rendered it too hazardous to attempt extensive offensive move ments in an open country, against a numerous and well disciplined army. Although my forces, as to number, had been increased by the arrival of the Kentucky division, my strength had received very little addition ; a small portion only of that detach ment being provided with arms. Compelled thus to"], [216, "208 NAVAL BATTLES^ wait the attack of the enemy, 1 took every measure to repel it when it should be made, and to defeat the object he had in view. General Morgan with the Orleans contingent, the Louisiana militia and a strong detachment of the Kentucky troops, occupied an in trenched camp on the opposite side of the river, pro tected by strong batteries on the bank, erected and superintended by commodore Patterson. In my encampment every thing was ready for ac tion, when, early on the morning of the 8th, the ene my after throwing a heavy shower of bombs and congreve rockets, advanced their columns on my right and left, to storm my intrenchments. I cannot speak sufficiently in praise of the firmness and delib eration with which the whole line received their ap proach \u2014 more could not have been expected from veterans inured to war. \u2014 For an hour, the fire of the small arms was as incessant and severe as can be imagined. The artillery, too, directed by officers who displayed equal skill and courage, did great ex ecution. Yet the columns of the enemy continued to advance with a firmness which reflects the greatest credit. Twice the column which approached me on my left, was repulsed by the troops of general Car roll, those of general Coffee, and a division of the Kentucky militia, and twice they formed again and renewed the assault. At length, however, cut to pieces, they fled in confusion from the field, leaving it covered with their dead and wounded. The loss which the enemy sustained on this occa sion, cannot be estimated at less than fifteen hundred"], [217, "209 NAVAL BATTLES. in killed, wounded and prisoners. Upwards of three hundred have already been delivered over for burial ; and my men are still engaged in picking them up within my lines and carrying them to the point where the enemy are to receive them. \u2014 This is an addition to the dead and wounded whom the enemy have been enabled to carry from the field, during, and since the action, and to those who have since died of the wounds they received. We have taken about five hundred prisoners, upwards of three hundred of whom are wounded, and a great part of them mortally. My loss has not exceeded, and I believe has not amounted to ten killed and as many wounded. The entire destruction of the enemy's army was now inevi table had it not been for an unfortunate occurrence which at this moment took place on the other side of the river. Simultaneously with his advance upon my lines, he had thrown over in his boats a considerable force to the other side of the river. This having landed, was hardly enough to advance against the works of general Morgan ; and, what is strange and difficult to account for, at the very moment when its entire discomfiture was looked for with a confidence approaching to certainty, the Kentucky reinforce ments, in whom so much reliance had been placed, ingloriously fled, drawing after them by their exam ple, the remainder of the forces ; and thus yielded to the enemy that most fortunate position. The bat teries which had rendered me, for many days, the most import service, though bravely defended, were 27"], [218, "210 NAVAL BATTLES. of course now abandoned ; not, however, until the guns had been spiked. This unfortunate route had totally changed the as pect of affairs. The enemy now occupied a position from which they might annoy us without hazard, and by means of which they might have been en abled to defeat, in a great measure, the effects of our success on this side the river. It became there fore an object of the first consequence to dislodge him as soon as possible. For this object, all the means in my power, which I could with any safety use, were immediately put in preparation. Perhaps, however, it was owing somewhat to another cause that I succeeded even beyond my expectations. In negotiating the terms of a temporary suspension of hostilities to enable the enemy to bury their dead and provide for their wounded, I had required certain propositions to be acceded to as a basis; among which this was one \u2014 that although hostilities should cease on this side the river until twelve o'clock of this day, yet it was not to be understood that they should cease on the other side ; but that rio reinforce ments should be sent across by either army until the expiration of that day. His excellency Maj. Gen. Lambert begged time to consider of these proposi tions until ten o'clock of to-day, and in the meantime recrossed his troops. I need not tell you with how much eagerness I immediately regained possession of the position he had thus hastily quitted."], [219, "NAVAL BATTLES. 211 In a subsequent letter, general Jackson states the loss of the enemy to have been much greater than what he at first computed. Upon information which was believed to be correct, colonel Haynes re ported it to have been in total two thousand six hundred, viz. seven hundred killed, fourteen hundred wounded, and five hundred prisoners, including one major, four captains, eleven lieutenants, and one en sign, who were among the latter. The American loss on both sides of the Mississippi was thirteen killed, thirty-nine wounded, and nineteen missing \u2014 total seventy-one. Of this number six were killed and seven wounded in the action on the eastern bank of the river, and the residue in a sortie after the ac tion and in the action on the western bank. Among the British officers killed were Sir Edward Paken ham, lieutenant-general and commander in chief, (cut asunder by a cannon ball) major-general Gibbs, colonel Raynor, majors Pringle, Whitaker and Wilk inson. Among their wounded was major-general Keane, severely. Numerous accounts official as well as unofficial, represent this battle to have been the greatest ever fought on the American continent. For disparity of loss a parallel can scarcely be found in ancient or modern history. So determined were the enemy to carry our works that many came up to the very muzzles of our guns, and some penetrated into our lines, where they were either killed or taken prison ers. Many fell mounting the breast-works ; othere were slain upon the works ; and the ditch in front"], [220, "212 NAVAL BATTLES. was, in many places, literally filled with dead and wounded. The roar of artillery from our lines was incessant, while an unintermitted rolling fire was kept up from our muskets. The atmosphere was filled with sheets of fire and volumes of smoke. For an hour and a quarter the enemy obstinately con tinued the assault ; fresh men constantly arriving to fill up their lines thinned by our fire. Their deter mined perseverance and steady valour, were worthy of a better cause ; nor did their troops falter, until almost all the officers who had lead them to the at tack had fallen. At one time, a body of the enemy succeeded in gaining possession of a bastion on our right with three pieces of cannon in it ; but so de structive was our fire, that every man who entered was either killed by our riflemen or disabled before they could spike the guns. Our men soon returned to the charge and regained the bastion. So intent were the enemy in getting over our works, that they pulled off their shoes for the purpose of climbing them ; but nearly all who made the attempt were either killed or taken prisoners. The guns of commodore Patterson's batteries, on the opposite side of the river, did great execution, until the retreat of the Kentucky troops, who had been posted near them. The commodore, finding himself thus deserted, was compelled, with a handful of brave men, to retire, after spiking his guns. The British afterwards burnt the gun carriages, being foiled in their expectations of using the guns to an noy our troops on the opposite shore."], [221, "213 NAVAL BATTLES. Previous to the battle of the 8th of January, the pirates of Barataria, who had been held in custody, were released by order of general Jackson, upon condi tion that they would assist in defending the city of New-Orleans. In the battle of that day they proved themselves excellent artillerists, and were, together with a few Frenchmen, successfully employed in serving the pieces. They were afterwards released from any further confinement, having received (at the request of the general assembly of Louisiana) a full pardon from the president of the United States. Soon after the battle, the enemy sent in a flag of truce, and twenty-four hours were allowed them to remove and bury their dead. In one small spot alone, on the left of our lines, they found three hundred and sixty-eight dead bodies. In the course of the day forty carts and ten boats arrived at New Orleans, loaded with wounded prisoners, who were put into the barracks, which jwere converted into temporary hospitals ; about one hundred and fifty unwounded prisoners were also put in confinement. \u2014 To the wounded every attention was paid by the citizens \u2022 the nuns of the convent took the glorious lead. They under the immediate superintendance of the Abbe Douburg, threw open their doors and converted all their houses, separated from their main building, into a hospital, where they themselves, at their own ex pense, and with their own hands, took care of the sick and wounded. The ladies of New-Orleans were also employed in the same charitable acts ot benevolence, as likewise in making clothes for our"], [222, "214 NAVAL BATTLES. soldiers. The future historian will delight to con trast the destroying and brilliant virtues of the one sex, with the preserving and not less attracting vir tues of the other. Immediately after their repulse, the enemy com menced active operations for a re-embarkation of their troops. Nearly the whole of the sick and wounded were sent on board their vessels, together with such baggage and munitions of war as could be safely spared. During these operations, the enemy kept up a menacing attitude \u2014 frequent indications were given of an intention to renew the attack on our lines, and vigorous works of defence were thrown up in front of our camp. The rear of their army retired first, while they displayed a numerous body of men to the view of our troops, and at night their fires seemed rather to increase than diminish. They had erected batteries to cover their retreat, in advantageous posi tions, from their original encampment, to the bayou through which they entered lake Borgne. The cannon placed on these batteries would have raked a pursuing army in every direction, and any attempt to storm them would have been attended with very great slaughter. Having made the necessary ar rangements, the whole British army precipitately retreated on the night of the 18th of January ; an account of which was officially given by general Jackson to the secretary of war. The enemy's loss after decampment, and on ship board, (including about three hundred drowned while"], [223, "NAVAL BATTLES. 215 passing to and from their shipping,) amount to four thousand eight hundred.* The American loss in the several engagements, was fifty-five killed, one hundred and eighty-five wounded, and ninety-three missing \u2014 total, three hundred and thirty-three. Of our forces actually engaged (including marines as well as land troops) the following is a correct statement : \u2014 In the action of the 28th of December, three thousand two hundred and eighty-two ; 1st of January, three thousand nine hundred and sixty-one ; 8th of January, four thousand six hundred and ninety-eight. The enemy's force previous to the 6th of January, was nine thousand ; after that time it was increased to twelve thousand. CRUISE OF THE PRESIDENT. On the 18th February, 1814, commodore Rod gers arrived at Sandy Hook in the United States frigate President from a cruise in the course of which she passed most of the West India Islands. After being off Charleston two days she was chased by a seventy-four, two frigates, and several sloops of war. She had captured and sunk three British merchant men, and taken on board thirty prisoners. * A number of British deserters and prisoners have stated their loss to have exceeded five thousand ; and it is worthy of remark, that the British official account of the action on the 8th of January represents it as very considerably surpassing the statement given by general Jackson."], [224, "216 NAVAL BATTLES. One occurrence that took place during this cruise is truly deserving of record. Several strange sail were observed, and one large ship to the windward, that proved to be a seventy four, which came down within gunshot. Commodore Rodgers had cleared ship for action, and continued with the main top-sail to the mast. After hauling her wind on the larboard tack, the enemy kept her distance, and the Presi dent remained three hours with her main top-sail to the mast. As the enemy evinced no disposition to engage, the President gave her a shot to windward and hoisted colours \u2014 the seventy-four then bore up, and backed main top-sail when she had approached within gun shot. After mustering all hands aft, commodore Rodgers addressed them in a spirited and appropriate manner, and immediately gave or ders to wear ship for the engagement. While back ing to meet the cutter, and take a pilot on board, the commodore was surprised to observe the enemy stand ing off to the southward and eastward. A frigate and gun brig appearing in sight, he hauled in main and fore tacks and made for land. For the space of five hours the enemy had it at all times in his power to bring the President to action, and she lay in readiness with main top-sail aback and expecting him. Captain Lloyd who commanded the seventy-four, which proved to be the Plantagenet, states that his crew was in a state of mutiny, and gives this as a reason for declining art engagement with the Presi dent."], [225, "217 NAVAL BATTLES PRESIDENT AND PLANTAGENET"], [226, "218 NAVAL BATTLES ESCAPE OF THE CONSTITUTION FROM THE TENEDOS AND ENDYMION On the 3d of April, 1814, the United States frig ate Constitution, captain Stewart, arrived at Mar blehead, having been chased in by the British frig ates Tenedos and Endymion, of thirty-eight guns each, which had been in chase of her from daylight. The frigates, or one of them, it is said, got within two or three miles of the Constitution, at one time, and to effect her escape she was obliged to throw overboard her provisions, &c. and every thing move able, and started all her water. Some prize goods were likewise thrown over. She immediately anchored above fort Sewall, in a posture of defence, her exposed situation rendering her liable to an attack, should she remain there long. In order to the protection of the frigate and the town, a number of heavy cannon were sent over from Sa lem, and major general Hovey issued an order for the Marblehead battalion of artillery to hold itself in readiness to act. Commodore Bainbridge, to whom an express had been sent, despatched assistance from the navy yard in Charlestown, and the company of New England Guards began their march from Bos ton, to afford such aid as might be required of them. But towards evening the Constitution weighed an chor and came round into Salem harbour. [Salem Gazette."], [227, "219 NAVAL BATTLES. CONSTITUTION'S ESCAPE FROM THE TENEDOS AND ENDYMION"], [228, "220 NAVAL BATTLES. i HORNET AND PENGUIN. On the 23d of March, 1815, as the Hornet, com manded by captain Biddle, was about to anchor off the north end of the island of Tristan d'Acuna, a sail was seen to the southward ; which, at forty minutes past one, hoisted English colours, and fired a gun. The Hornet immediately luffed to, hoisted an ensign, and gave the enemy a broadside. A quick and well' directed fire was kept up from the Hornet, the enemy gradually drifting nearer, with an intention, as captain Biddle supposed, to board. The enemy's1 bowsprit came in between the main and mizzen rigging on the starboard side of the Hornet, giving him an opportunity to board, if he had wish ed, but no attempt was made. There was a consid erable swell, and as the sea lifted the Hornet ahead, the enemy's bowsprit carried away her mizzen shrouds, stern davits, and spanker booms, and hung upon her larboard quarter. At this moment an offi cer called out that they had surrendered. Captain Biddle directed the marines' to stop firing, and, while asking if they had surrendered, received a wound in the neck, The enemyjust then got clear of the Hornet ; and his foremast and bowsprit being both gone, and perceiving preparations to give him another broadside, he again called out that he had surrendered. It was with great difficulty that cap tain Biddle could restrain his crew from firing into"], [229, "NAVAL BATTLES 221 HORNET AND PENGUIN,"], [230, "222 NAVAL BATTLES. him again, as it was certain he had fired into the Hornet after having surrendered. From the firing of the first gun to the last time the enemy cried out that he had surrendered, was exactly twenty-two minutes. \u25a0 The vessel proved to be the British brig Penguin, of twenty guns, a remarkably fine ves sel of her class, and One hundred and thirty-two men ; twelve of them supernumeraries from the Medway, seventy-four, received on board in conse quence of their being ordered to cruise for the priva teer Young Wasp. The Penguin had fourteen killed and twenty-eight wounded. Among the killed was captain Dicken son, who fell at the close of the action- As she was completely riddled, and so crippled as to be incapa ble of being secured, and being at a great distance from the United States, captain Biddle ordered her to be scuttled and sunk. The Hornet did not receive a single round shot in her hull ; and though much cut in her sails and rig ging, was soon made ready for further service. Her loss was one killed and eleven wounded. ESCAPE OF THE HORNET. On the 28th of April, 1815, the Hornet was chas ed by a British seventy-four, and was compelled to throw over her guns, shot, spars, &c. She escaped, and put in at St. Salvador. On his arrival at that"], [231, "223 NAVAL BATTLES. port, captain Biddle received information of the peace between the United States and Great Britain. On the return of captain Biddle to the United States a naval ccurt of inquiry was held by order of the secretary of the navy, on board the Hornet, in the harbour of New York, on the 23d of August, 1815, to investigate the causes of the return of that ship into port, and to inquire into the circumstances attending the loss of armament, stores, &c. during her cruise ; and the following opinion has been pro nounced by the court : The court, after mature deliberation on the testi mony adduced, are of opinion, that no blame is im putable to captain Biddle, on account of the return of the Hornet into port, with the loss of her arma ment, stores, &c. and that the greatest applause is due to him for his persevering gallantry and nautical skill, evinced in escaping, under the most disadvan tageous circumstances, after a long and arduous chase by a British line-of- battle ship.

The privateer schooner Atlas, of nineteen guns, captain David Moffat, soon after the declaration of war, sailed from Philadelphia. On the third of August, at eight a. m. she discovered two sail, for which she bore away. At eleven o'clock, the action was commenced by the Atlas, with a broadside and musketry. She continued engaged with both ships till noon, when the smallest one struck her colours. The Atlas then directed the whole of her fire against the large ship ; when the small one, though her colours were down, renewed her fire on the At las, which had to recommence firing on her. In a few minutes every man was driven' from her decks. Twenty minutes after twelve, the large ship struck. Possession was immediately taken of both of them. One proved to be the ship Pursuit, captain Chivers, of four hundred and fifty tons, sixteen guns, and thirty-five men. The other was the ship Planter, captain Frith of two hundred and eighty tons, twelve guns, and fifteen men. The cargoes of both were very valuable. The Atlas had two men killed and five wounded, and her rigging and sails much injured. She arriv ed safe in port with the Pursuit ; the Planter was recaptured off the capes of Delaware."], [233, "225 NAVAL BATTLES. THE YOUNG EAGLE, Of New York, of one gun and forty-two men, engaged the British armed ship Granada, of eleven guns and thirty men, and another armed vessel in company with her. After an action of an hour and a half, the Young Eagle succeeded in capturing them both. THE MONTGOMERY, Captain Upton, of Boston, mounting twelve guns, on the 6th of December, 1812, off Surinam fell in with the British vessel of war Surinam, of twenty guns. They lay board and board for half an hour. Some of the privateer's men lashed the bob stay of the Surinam to the Montgomery's main-mast. So spirited was the resistance on both sides, that neither could succeed in boarding. One of the Montgomery's eighteen pounders was repeatedly discharged into the bows of her antagonist between wind and water. As soon as the two vessels parted, the Surinam made sail from the Montgomery. Her foremost was shot away, and she was otherwise so much disabled, as to be compelled to put into an outport to refit, without proceeding to the common place of rendezvous at Barbadoes. 29"], [234, "226 NAVAL BATTLES. THE DOLPHIN, Of Baltimore, of ten guns and sixty men, in the latter part of the year, engaged two British armed vessels at the same time, the one of sixteen guns and forty men, and the other of ten guns and twenty five men. She captured them both. THE ROLLA, Of Baltimore, of nineteen guns, captured seven vessels in one cruise, the guns ot which amounted to fifty-eight, and the prisoners to one hundred and fifty. THE HAZARD, Of Charleston, of three guns and thirty-eight men, commanded by Placide le Chartier, while at anchor off the island of Davie, discovered a man of war brig convoying five merchantmen. One of these last, having lost her mizzenmast, could not keep up with the rest of the convoy. As soon as they were out of sight, the Hazard pursued her, to which, after"], [235, "227 NAVAL BATTLES. some resistance, she struck. She proved to be the Albion, of London, copper-bottomed, and of three hundred tons burden, navigated by fifteen men, and mounting twelve, guns. ' While the Hazard was lying off Charleston, in a fog, her prize was separated from her, and recaptured by a British Cutter, the Caledonia, of eight guns and thirty-eight men. Three days after, on the 22d of February, the Hazard discovered her prize in company with the above-mentioned British cutter. The Hazard commenced a pursuit of them both. As soon as the Hazard came within musket shot, she commenced firing at the ship and cutter, which was returned by them with spirit, and apparent deter mination. At three o'clock, the second lieutenant, carpenter, and five men of the Hazard, were severely wounded. At five, the cutter hauled off to repair the damages she had sustained. At half past five, the Hazard came close to the cutter, the crew of the former, having determined to lose their lives sooner than give up so valuable a prize. At half past six the British cutter again hauled off, and con tinued to fire at a distance. Taking advantage of this, the Hazard bore down on the prize, and after a brisk fire caused her to strike her colours. She was then ordered to lie to. The British cutter having shot ahead, Le Chartier instantly gave chase, keeping up a brisk fire. He pursued her until eight o'clock. The cutter then ceased firing, and hailed, saying she had struck, and signified the same by hoisting and lowering a lantern"], [236, "228 NAVAL BATTLES. three times. The Hazard having then but twenty one men, including the captain on board, it was not thought advisable to take possession of her. She bore doWn for the prize, of which she took possession, leaving a prize-master, and six men on board of her so that there only remained fourteen men on board of the Hazard. Both the Hazard and her prize ar rived safe at St. Mary's. THE COMET, Of Baltimore, captain Boyle, of twelve guns and one hundred and twenty men, being on a cruise, dis covered, on the 14th of January, 1813, four sail standing out of Pernambuco. She lay by to give them an opportunity of getting off shore, with a view of then cutting them off. At three p. m. they were upon a Wind standing s. E. and about six leagues from land. The Comet bore up, and made sail in chase. At six, one of them was discovered to be a large man of war brig. All hands were im mediately called to quarters on board the Comet ; the guns were loaded with round and grape shot ; and the ship cleared for action. At seven, being close to the chase, she hoisted her colours, and came close to the man of war brig, which had hoisted Portuguese colours. The commander hailed, and"], [237, "229 NAVAL BATTLES. sent an officer on board the Comet, who informed captain Boyle, that the brig was a Portuguese na tional vessel, mounting twenty thirty-two pounders and one hundred and sixty-five men ; that the three others were strongly armed English vessels : and that he must not molest them. Captain Boyle in formed him that he certainly should make use of every exertion to capture them. The Portuguese said he was ordered to protect them, and certainly should. The English vessels were ahead of the Comet. They consisted of a ship of fourteen guns, and two brigs of ten guns each. So that including the Por- tuguese vessel, the Comet had a force of fifty- four guns to oppose. Captain Boyle immediately made sail for them ; came up with the ship, hailed her, and ordered the captain to have the mainsail back- ed. He gave little or no answer. The Comet hav- ing shot ahead, captain Boyle informed him, that he should be along in a few minutes, when if he did not obey his orders, he would pour a broadside into the ship. In a few minutes the Comet tacked, the Portuguese sloop of war being close after her, and ran along side of the ship, one of the brigs being close to her. The Comet opened a broadside on them both. It was now about half past eight p. m. All the vessels were carrying a press of sail. The Comet, from her superior sailing, was frequently obliged to tack. From this she would have profit ed very much, had not the Portuguese sloop of war been so close. The latter now opened a heavy"], [238, "230 NAVAL BATTLES. fire on the Comet, with round and grape shot, which she returned. The Comet had now the whole force of the four vessels to contend with. She, however, kept as closely as possible to the . English vessels. They frequently separated, to give the sloop of war an opportunity of firing into the Comet. The latter as frequently poured whole broadsides into them ; at times also into the sloop of war. About eleven p. m. the ship surrendered \u2014 she Was cut to pieces, and rendered unmanageable. Soon after the brig Bowes struck \u2014 she also was much in jured. A boat was sent to take possession of her ; as it passed the sloop of war, a broadside was fired by ner, which nearly sunk it, and obliged it to return. The Comet then commenced a brisk fire at the sloop of war, which sheered off to some distance. After following her a short distance, she obliged the third English vessel to strike. The latter was very much cut to pieces. The Comet now again proceed ed to take possession of the Bowes, when she spoke the ship that had first surrendered \u2014 her captain be ing ordered to follow, informed captain Boyle that his ship was in a sinking condition, having many shot holes between wind and water, and every rope on board of her being cut away. At half past one, a. m. the Bowes was taken possession of and man ned. The sloop of war then fired a broadside into the prize, and passed her. The moon was now down, and it became quite dark and squally. This caused the Comet to separate from the other vessels, excepting the sloop of war, with which broadsides"], [239, "231 NAVAL BATTLES. were frequently exchanged. At two, she stood to the south. Captain Boyle now thought it most pru dent to take care of one of the prizes until daylight, the other two being out of sight. At daybreak, the sloop of war, and the two other prizes, a ship and brig, were discovered. The Comet immediately hove about, and stood for them. The sloop tacked, and made signals for her convoy to make for the first port. Captain Boyle, knowing the situation of the ship and brig, determined not to take possession of them, but to watch their man\u0153uvres. Great ex ertions appeared to be made to keep them from sinking. Captain Boyle was afterwards informed that the sloop of war, was much injured \u2014 she had five men killed, and a number wounded. The ship's mast scarcely lasted to carry her into Pernambuco. Her cargo was nearly all damaged. It was with diffi culty the brig was kept from sinking before she reached Pernambuco harbour. After capturing the Aberdeen, of eight guns, two vessels of ten guns each, in sight of a sloop of war, and a schooner, captain Boyle returned to the Unit ed States. He passed the blockading squadron in the Chesapeake, and arrived safe at Baltimore."], [240, "232 NAVAL BATTLES. V THE GENERAL ARMSTRONG, A schooneb of eighteen guns, commanded by captain Champlin, was cruising off Surinam, on the 11th March, 1813. At seven a. m. she discovered a sail, which at half past eight, fired three guns, and hoisted English colours. About nine, the Armstrong fired a gun, and hoisted American colours. At half after nine, the British vessel tacked, and stood as near the Armstrong as the wind would permit, keep ing up a brisk fire from her main deck guns. At half past ten, the Armstrong bore down, intending to pour her starboard broadside into her, then wear ship, discharge the larboard broadside, and then board. This was done, except the boarding. The English vessel was now discovered to be a frigate pierced for twenty-four guns. She kept up a constant fire on the Armstrong, which lay for ten minutes like a log. The fore-top-sail and mizzen-gaff halyards of the frigate were shot away. This brought down her colours. The crew of the Armstrong, thinking she had struck, ceased firing. But they were soon again seen flying, and the action was renewed. The fri gate lay for a few minutes apparently unmanageable. She soon, however, recovered, and opened a heavy fire from her starboard broadside and main-top ; ap parently with the intention of sinking the Armstrong. The latter lay for the space of forty-five minutes within pistol shot of the frigate. Captain Champlin"], [241, "233 NAVAL BATTLES. was standing by the centre gun, in the act of firing his pistol, when he was wounded by a musket ball from the main-top of the frigate. The Armstrong luffed to windward, and forereached the frigate. The Armstrong had six men killed, and sixteen wounded, and was very much injured in her rigging, masts, and hull \u2014 she, however, succeeded in escap ing from the frigate. THE YOUNG TEAZER, Captain Dobson, of New York, was chased into Halifax by the Sir John Sherbroke, a vessel of supe rior force. When within the light house she hoisted English colours over the American, and was chased nearly up to the forts, when the Sir John Sherbroke supposing her to be a prize, hove about, and put to sea. As soon as the latter was out of sight, the Young Teazer hauled down her English colours, and effected her escape. THE DECATUR, Of Charleston, mounting seven guns, with a crew of one hundred and three men, and commanded by captain Diron, being on a cruise in the month of August, discovered a ship and schooner. She imme- 30"], [242, "234 NAVAL BATTLES. diately stood towards them to reconnoitre. At half past twelve, the Decatur was abreast of the schooner, which hoisted English colours. At one the Decatur wore round ; and half an hour after the schooner fired a shot without effect. The captain of the Decatur immediately gave orders to prepare for action. At two o'clock the schooner fired another shot, which passed over the Decatur. At a quarter past two, the latter fired her large gun, and hoisted American colours at the peak : two more discharges were made from the same piece, which were answered by two guns from the British schooner. The two vessels were now within half gun shot distance. Captain Diron, observing that the schooner was prepared to bear away, hauled upon the larboard tack, in order to present the bow of his vessel to his antagonist. Soon afterwards the latter fired her whole broadside, which only slightly damaged the Decatur's rigging. This was returned from the eighteen pounder of the Decatur. Her captain at the same time, ordered every one of the crew to his post, in order to carry the British vessel by boarding, as soon as the neces sary preparations for the purpose should be made. It was now three quarters of an hour past two, and the vessels were within pistol shot of each other. A severe fire of musketry commenced from the Deca tur. The British schooner bore away to prevent being boarded ; and fired a broadside into the Deca tur, which killed two of her men, and injured her rigging and sails. The Decatur closely followed her antagonist in her man\u0153uvres, and again endeavoured"], [243, "235 NAVAL BATTLES. to board, which the schooner once more avoided, and fired another broadside. A third attempt was made by the captain of the Decatur to board. The jib boom of the Decatur was run into the mainsail of the schooner, and the latter not being able to disen gage herself dropped along side. During this ma n\u0153uvre the fire from the cannon and musketry on both sides was extremely severe and destructive. While the two vessels lay in this position captain Diron ordered his whole crew, armed with pistols, sabres, &c. to board, which was performed with the greatest promptness. The resistance of the English was desperate. Fire arms soon became useless, and the contest was carried on with the cutlass. The captain and principal officers of the British vessel being killed, and her deck covered with dead and wounded, her colours were hauled down by the crew of the Decatur, when the two vessels were separat ed, having their rigging and sails cut to pieces. The English vessel was his Britannick majesty's schooner Dominica, of fifteen guns, with a crew of eighty-eight men. The Decatur had four men killed and sixteen wounded ; the Dominica thirteen killed and forty-seven wounded. Among the killed of the Dominica was her brave commander, who, as long as he lived, refused to surrender his vessel, and de clared his determination not to survive her loss. The king's packet Princess Charlotte, remained an inactive spectator of this bloody contest, which lasted an hour. As soon as the vessels were disengaged, she tacked about and stood to the southward. She"], [244, "236 NAVAL BATTLES. had sailed from St. Thomas, under convoy of the Dominica. The Decatur and her prize arrived safe in port. THE SARATOGA, Of four guns and one hundred and sixteen men, belonging to New York, while cruising off Surinam river, in the month of September, discovered the British packet, brig Morgiana, of eighteen guns, with a crew of about fifty men, commanded by James Cunningham. Captain Aderton, the com mander of the Saratoga, immediately gave chase : when within musket shot, the Morgiana hoisted English colours, and the action commenced : part of the time the vessels were within pistol shot : the remainder, they were close along side of each other. After an action of an hour and a quarter the Sarato ga succeeded in capturing the British vessel by boarding. The action was extremely severe. Both vessels were almost reduced to wrecks. The Sara toga had almost all her stays, shrouds, &c. cut away. In her mainsail there were upwards of a hundred shot holes. A number of shot also struck her masts, spars, and hull. The crew of the Morgiana fought with desperation. She had two men killed and eight wounded. The Saratoga had two men killed and five wounded. Both arrived safe in port."], [245, "237 NAVAL BATTLES. THE GENERAL ARMSTRONG. The following letter from John D. Dabney, Esq. American consul at Fayal, (Portugal,) gives the par ticulars of a flagrant violation of the neutrality of that port, in an attack upon the privateer General Arm strong, by the enemy. The Armstrong belonged to New York, and mounted eight long nines and a twenty-four pounder. Fayal, October 5, 1814. Sib, \u2014 I have the honour to state to you that a most outrageous violation of the neutrality of this port, in utter contempt of the laws of civilized na tions, has recently been committed here, by the com manders of his Britannick majesty's ships Plantaga net, Rota and Carnation, against the American pri vate armed brig General Armstrong, Samuel C. Reid, commander ; but I have great satisfaction in being able to add, that this occurrence terminated in one of the most brilliant actions on the part of captain Reid, his brave officers and crew, that can be found on naval record. The American brig came to anchor in this port in the afternoon of the 26th of September, and at sun set of the same day, the above named ships sudden ly appeared in these roads ; it being nearly calm in the port, it was rather doubtful if the privateer could escape if she got under way, and relying on the jus tice and good faith of the British captains, it was"], [246, "238 NAVAL BATTLES. 1 i deemed most prudent to remain at anchor. A little after dusk captain Reid seeing some suspicious move ments on the part of the British, began to warp his vessel close under the guns of the castle, and while doing so, he was at about eight o'clock, p. m. ap proached by four boats from the ships filled with armed men. After hailing them repeatedly and warning them to keep off, he ordered his men to fire upon them and killed and wounded several men. The boats returned the fire and killed one man and wounded the first lieutenant of the privateer, and re turned to their ships ; and, as it was now light moon light, it was plainly perceived from the brig as well as from the shore, that a formidable attack was pre meditating. Soon after midnight, twelve or more large boats, crowded with men from the ships, and armed with carronades, swivels and blunderbusses, small arms, &c. attacked the brig ; a severe contest ensued which lasted about forty minutes and ended in the total defeat and partial destruction of the boats, with a most unparalleled carnage on the part of the British. It is estimated by good judges that near four hundred men were in the boats when the attack commenced, and no doubt exists in the minds of the numerous spectators of the scene, that more than one half of them were killed or wounded ; sev eral boats were destroyed ; two of them remained along side of the brig literally loaded with their own dead. From these two boats only seventeen reached the shore alive ; most of them were severe ly wounded. The whole of the following day the"], [247, "239 NAVAL BATTLES. British were occupied in burying their dead ; among them were two lieutenants and one midshipman of the Rota \u2014 the first lieutenant of the Plantaganet, it is said, cannot survive his wounds, and many of the seamen who reached their ships were mortally wounded and have been dying daily. The British, mortified at this signal and unexpected defeat, endea- voured to conceal the extent of the loss ; they admit however that they lost in killed and who have died since the engagement, upwards of one hundred and twenty of the flower of their officers and men. The captain of the Rota told me he lost seventy men from his ship. Two days after this affair took place the British sloops of war Thais and Calypso came into port, when captain Lloyd immediately took them into requisition to carry home the wounded offi- cers and seamen. They have sailed for England, one on the 2d and the other on the 4th instant, each carried twenty-five badly wounded. Those who were slighty wounded, to the number, as I am in- formed, of about thirty, remained on board of their respective ships, and sailed last evening for Jamaica. Strict orders were given that the sloops of war should take no letters whatever to England, and those or ders were rigidly adhered to. In face of the testimony of all Fayal, and a num ber of respectable strangers, who happened to be in this place at the moment, the British commander en deavours to throw the odium of this transaction on the American captain, Reid, alleging that he sent the boats merely to reconnoitre the brig, and without any"], [248, "I 240 NAVAL BATTLES. hostile intentions ; the pilots of the port did inform them of the privateer the moment they entered the port. To reconnoitre an enemy's vessel in a friendly port, at night, with four boats, carrying, by the best accounts, one hundred and twenty men, is certainly a strange proceeding ! The fact is, they expected as the brig was warping in, that the Americans would not be prepared to receive them, and they had hopes of carrying her by a \" coup de main.\" If any thing could add to the baseness of this transaction on the part of the British commander, it is the want of can dour openly and boldly to avow the facts. In vain can he expect by such subterfuge to shield himself from the indignation of the world, and the merited resentment of his own government and nation for thus trampling on the sovereignty of their most an cient and faithful ally, and for the wanton sacrifice of British lives. On the part of the Americans the loss was com paratively nothing ; two killed and seven wounded : of the slain we have to lament the loss of the sec ond lieutenant, Mr. Alexander O. Williams, of New York, a brave and meritorious officer. Among the wounded are Messrs. Worth and John son, first and third lieutenants ; captain Reid was thus deprived, early in the action, of the services ol all his lieutenants ; but his cool and intrepid conduct secured him the victory. On the morning of the 27th ult. one of the British ships placed herself near the shore and commenced a heavy cannonade on the privateer. Finding fur-"], [249, "241 NAVAL BATTLES. ther resistance unavailing, captain Reid ordered her to be abandoned after being partially destroyed, to prevent her falling into the hands of the enemy, who soon after sent their boats and set her on fire. At nine o'clock in the evening (soon after the first attack) I applied to the governour, requesting his excellency to protect the privateer,' either by force or by such remonstrance to the commander of the squadron as Would cause him to desist from any fur- ther attempt. The governour indignant at what had passed, but feeling himself totally unable with the slender means he possessed, to resist such a force, took the part of remonstrating, which he did in for- cible but respectful terms. His letter to captain Lloyd had no other effect than to produce a menacing reply insulting in the highest degree. Nothing can exceed the indignation of the publick authorities, as well as of all ranks and descriptions of persons here, at this unprovoked enormity. Such was the rage of the British to destroy this vessel, that no regard was paid to the safety of the town ; some of the inhabi- tants were wounded, and a number of houses wem much damaged. The strongest representations on on this subject are prepared by the governour for his court. Since this affair the commander, captain Lloyd, threatened to send on shore an armed force, and arrest the privateer's crew ; saying there were many Englishmen among them ; and our poor fellows, afraid of his vengeance, have fled to the mountains several times, and have been harrassed extremely. 31"], [250, "242 NAVAL BATTLES. At length, captain Lloyd, fearful of losing more men if he put his threats in execution, adopted this strata gem : he addressed an official letter to the governour, statine that in the American crew were two men who deserted from his squadron in America, and as they were guilty of high treason, he required them to be found and given up. Accordingly a force was sent into the country, and the American seamen were ar rested and brought to town, and as they could not designate the said pretended deserters, all the sea men here passed an examination of the British offi cers, but no such persons were to be found among them. I was requested by the governour and British consul to attend this humiliating examination, as was also captain Reid ; but we declined to sanction by our presence any such proceedings. Captain Reid has protested against the British commanders of the squadron for the unwarrantable destruction of his vessel in a neutral and friendly port, as also against the government of Portugal for their inability to protect him. I have the honour to be, with great respect, sir, your most obedient servant. JOHN B. DABNEY. To the Secretary of State of the United States, Washington"], [251, "FATE OF CAPTAIN PORTER'S SETTLEMENT AT NOOAHEEVAH. Letter from captain John M. Gamble of the marines, detailing the occurrences which took place at Nooaheevah aster the departure of captain Porter, and his subsequent capture by the Cherub. New York, August, 1815. Sib, \u2014 I have the honour to inform you, that on the 12th of December, 1813, the day on which the Essex frigate, and Essex junior, took their depar ture from Nooaheevah, I was left in port Anna Maria bay, with eighteen men under my command, and six prisoners of war, in charge of the establish ment on shore, together with the prize ships Green wich, Seringapatam, and Sir Andrew Hammond, with orders from captain Porter to remain five and a half calendar months at that place \u2014 at the expiration of which time, should he not return, or send me further instructions how to act, I was, if possible, to man two of the ships, and after taking every arti cle of value out of the other, and burning that ship, to repair to the port of Valparaiso \u2014 where, in the event of my not finding the frigate or additional or ders, I was authorized to dispose of one of the ships to the best advantage, taking on board the other all the men under my charge, as well as the prize crews of the different ships then in that port, and proceed to the United States. After receiving those instructions, my first object was, agreeably to the wish of captain Porter, to fill the ship New Zealander with oil from the other ships ;"], [252, "244 NAVAL BATTLES. and on the 28th of the same month she took her de parture for the United States, with a cargo of nine teen hundred and fifty barrels, and well found in every respect for so long a voyage. With regret, sir, I have to inform you, the frigate had not got clear of the Marquesas, before we dis covered in the natives a hostile disposition towards \u2022us, and in a few days they became so insolent, that I found it absolutely necessary, not only for the se curity of the ships and property on shore, but for our personal safety, to land my men and regain by force of arms the many articles they had in the most daring manner stolen from the encampment ; and what was of still greater importance, to prevent, if possible, their putting threats into execution, which might have been attended with the most serious con sequences on our part, from duty requiring my men to be so much separated. I, however, had the satisfaction to accomplish my wish without firing a musket, and from that time lived in perfect amity with them, until the 7th May following, when my distressed situation placed me in their power. Before mentioning the lamentable events of that day, and the two succeeding ones, I shall give you a brief account of a few preceding occurrences which were sources of great uneasiness to me. The first was the death of John Witter (a faithful old marine) who was unfortunately drowned in the surf on the afternoon of the 28th of February, and the desertion of four of my men ; the one Isaac"], [253, "245 NAVAL BATTLES. Coffin (black man) had deserted from the Essex the day before she sailed out of the bay, and was then a prisoner for attempting the second time to make his escape from the ships. They took the advantage of a dark night, and left the bay in a whale-boat, unob served by any person, all, excepting the prisoner, having the watch on deck. They took with them several muskets, a supply of ammunition, and many things of but little value. My attempt to pursue them was prevented, by their destroying, in a great measure, the only remaining boat at that time sea worthy. On the 12th April began to rig the ships Ser ingapatam, and Sir Andrew Hammond, which, as I calculated, employed the men until the 1st of May. All hands were then engaged in getting the remain der of the property from the Greenwich to the Serin gapatam, as I began to despair of the frigate rejoin ing me at that place. The work went on well, and the men were obe dient to my orders, though I discovered an evident change in their countenances, which led me to sup pose there was something wrong in agitation, and under that impression had all the muskets, and am munition, and small arms of every description taken to the Greenwich (the ship I lived on board of ) from the other ships, as a necessary precaution against a surprise from my own men. On the 7th of May, while on board the Seringa patam on duty which required my being presen , I was suddenly and violently attacked by the men"], [254, "246 NAVAL BATTLES. employed in that ship. After struggling a short time, and receiving many bruises, I was thrown down on the deck, and my hands and legs immediately tied. They then threw me on the second deck, thence dragged me into the cabin, and confined me to the run, where in a few minutes midshipman Fel tus, and acting midshipman Clapp were thrown in, tied in the same manner as myself : the scuttle was then nailed down and a sentinel placed over it. After spiking all the guns of the Greenwich, and of the fort, and those of the Sir Andrew Hammond that were loaded, plundering the ships of every thing valuable, \u2014 committing many wanton depredations on shore, taking all the arms and ammunition from the Greenwich ; sending for Robert White, the man who was sent .out of the Essex for mutinous conduct, and bending the necessary sails, they stood out of the bay, with a light wind off the land. My fellow prisoners, and shortly after myself, were then taken out of the run, and placed in the ca bin, under the immediate charge of several sentinels. Shortly after getting clear of the bay, one of the sentinels, though he had been repeatedly cautioned against putting his finger on the trigger, fired a pis tol, the contents of which passed though my heel a little below the ankle bone. I had not received the wound a moment before the men on deck pointed their muskets down the sky light, and were in the act of firing, when the sen tinel prevented them by saying the pistol was acci dentally discharged."], [255, "247 NAVAL BATTLES. At nine o'clock, the night dark, and the wind blowing fresh, after receiving by request from the mutineers a barrel of powder and three old muskets, I was put in a leaky boat, where I found my unfor tunate companions. In that situation, after rowing at least six miles, and every person exhausted from the great exertion made to prevent the boat from sinking, we reached the Greenwich, where I found my few remaining men anxiously looking out for me, and seriously alarmed at the conduct of the savages. They had already begun to plunder the encampment, and were informed by Wilson (a man who had lived among them for several years, and who, as I afterwards learnt, was not only instrumental to the mutiny, but had in my absence plundered the Sir Andrew Ham mond) of our defenceless situation. Finding it impossible to comply with that part of my instructions directing me to remain in the bay until the 27th May \u2014 I thought it most advisable to repair to the port of Valparaiso ; and with that view every soul, assisted by George Ross, and William Brudewell, (traders living on the island for the pur pose of collecting sandal wood,) exerted themselves in making the necessary preparations to depart. My first object was to put the Sir Andrew Ham mond in a situation that we might get under way at any moment. That done, all hands were engaged in getting the few articles of value from shore, and endeavouring to recover the stolen property from the Sir Andrew Hammond, when the savages made an"], [256, "248 NAVAL BATTLES. unprovoked and wanton attack upon us, in which I have, with the deepest regret, to inform you, midship man William Feltus, John Thomas, Thomas Gibbs, and William Brudewell were massacred, and Peter Caddington (marine) dangerously wounded ; but he made his escape together with William Worth, by swimming some distance, when they were taken out' of the water by midshipman Clapp and the only three men left. Our situation at that moment was most desperate \u2014 the savages put off in every direction with a view to intercept the boat, and board the ship, but were driven back by my firing the few guns we' had just before loaded with grape and cannister shot. Before the boat returned, and the guns were reloaded, they made the second attempt, and after wards repeated attempts, first to board the Sir Andrew Hammond, and then the Greenwich \u2014 but were re pulsed by our keeping up a constant firing. During this time several hundred were employed in pulling down the houses, and plundering the encampment, while others were in the fort, endeavouring (assisted by Wilson who had received several casks of powder from the mutineers) to get the spikes out of the guns. As soon as William Worth had recovered a little strength after being so long in the water, I sent the boat to the Greenwich, for John Pitlenger (a sick man) and some things that were indispensably neces sary, and with orders to burn that ship, and return with all possible despatch, as our ammunition was nearly all expended, and we had no other means of keeping the savages one moment out of the ship.\u2014"], [257, "249 NAVAL BATTLES. We then bent the jib and spanker, cut the moorings, and luckily had a light breeze that carried us clear of the bay, with six cartridges only remaining. It was then we found our situation most distressing. In attempting to run the boat up, it broke in two parts and we were compelled to cut away from the bows our only anchor, not being able to cat it. We mustered altogether eight souls \u2014 out of which there was one cripple confined to his bed, one man dangerously wounded, one sick, one convales cent, a feeble old man just recovering from the scur vy, and myself unable to lend any further assistance, the exertions of the day having so greatly inflamed my wound as to produce a violent fever, \u2014 leaving midshipman Clapp, and two men only capable of do ing duty. In that state, destitute of charts and of every means of getting to windward, I saw but one alternative, to run the trade winds down, and if pos sible to make the Sandwich islands, in hopes of either falling in with some of the Canton ships, (that being their principal place of rendezvous) or of obtaining some assistance from Tamaahmaah, the king of the Windward Islands. No time was lost in bending the topsails, and on the 10th of May we took our departure from Ro berts island. On the 25th of the same month made Owhyhee, and on the 30th after suffering much, came to an anchor in Whytetee bay, at the island of Whoohoo, where I found captain Winship, several officers of ships, and a number of men, from whom 32"], [258, "250 NAVAL BATTLES. (particularly captain Winship) I received every assist ance their situation could afford me. The natives, though at first surprised at our de plorable condition, and inquisitive to know the cause of it, which I did not think prudent to inform them, supplied the ship with fresh meat, fruits and vegeta bles, partly on condition that I would take the chief men of the island, and some others with their pro perty up to the Windward Islands, (where I found it necessary to go,) after shipping some men, in order to procure a supply of salt provisions from the king. From thence it was my intention to have proceeded to Valparaiso in compliance with my instructions from captain Porter, \u2014 but I was unfortunately cap tured on the passage by the English ship Cherub of twenty guns. I was somewhat surprised to hear captain Tucker say (when I pointed out a valuable canoe, and many other articles which I assured him was the property of the natives, and that I was mere ly conveying them, and it, from the one island to the other, the weather being to boisterous at that time for them to make the passage in their canoes,) that every thing found in a prize-ship belonged to the captors. . So that I had the mortification to see the people from whom I had received so much kindness, sent on shore, deprived of all they had been collecting foi twelve months past, and were about to present to their king as a tribute imposed upon them.

During her stay at the latter place, the frigates Briton and Tagus arrived from the Marquesas, where they had been in search of the ships left under my charge. On the 15th of December the prisoners were sent on shore, having received the most rigorous treat ment from captain Tucker, during their long confine ment in his ship, and the greater part of them, like the natives, left destitute of every thing, save the clothes on their backs.

Immediately after the ratification of peace with Great Britain, in February 1815, Congress, in con sequence of the hostile conduct of the regency of Al giers, declared war against that power. A squadron was immediately fitted out, under the command of commodore Decatur, consisting of the Guerriere, Con stellation, and Macedonian frigates, the Ontario and Epervier sloops of war, and the schooners Spark, Spitfire, Torch, and Flambeau. Another squadron, under commodore Bainbridge, was to follow this ar mament, on the arrival of which, it was understood, commodore Decatur would return to the United States in a single vessel, leaving the command of the whole combined force to commodore Bainbridge. The force under commodore Decatur rendezvoused at New York, from which port they sailed the 20th day of May, 1815, and arrived in the bay of Gib raltar in twenty-five days, after having previously communicated with Cadiz and Tangier. In the passage, the Spitfire, Torch, Firefly, and Ontario, separated at different times from the squadron in gales, but all joined again at Gibraltar, with the ex ception of the Firefly, which sprung her masts, and put back to New York to refit. Having learned at Gibraltar that the Algerine squadron, which had been out into the Atlantic, had undoubtedly passed up the straits, and that information of the arrival of the American force had been sent to Algiers by persons"], [262, "254 NAVAL BATTLES. in Gibraltar, commodore Decatur determined to pro ceed without delay, up the Mediterranean, in the hope of intercepting the enemy before he could re turn to Algiers, or gain a neutral port. \u2022 The 17th of June, off Cape de Gatt, he fell in with and captured the Algerine frigate Mazouda, in a running fight of twenty-five minutes. After two broadsides the Algerines ran below. The Guerriere had four men wounded by musketry \u2014 the Algerines about thirty killed, according to the statement of the prisoners, who amounted to four hundred and six. In this affair the famous Algerine admiral, or Rais, Hammida, who had long been the terror of this sea, was cut in two by a cannon shot. On the 19th of June, off cape Palos, the squadron fell in with and captured an Algerine brig of twenty two guns. The brig was chased close to the shore, where she was followed by the Epervier, Spark, Torch, and Spitfire, to whom she surrendered, after losing twenty-three men. No Americans were either killed or wounded. The captured brig, with most of the prisoners on board, was sent into Carthagena, where she has since been claimed by the Spanish government under the plea of a breach of neutrality. As this affair will probably become a subject of ne gotiation between the United States and Spain, we decline entering into further particulars. From cape Palos, the American squadron proceed ed to Algiers, where it arrived the 28th of June. Aware that a despatch-boat had been sent from Gib raltar, to inform the regency of his arrival, and having also learned that several Tartans had gone in search"], [263, "NAVAL BATTLES. 255 os the Algerines to communicate the news, commo dore Decatur concluded that their fleet was by this time safe in some neutral port. He therefore thought it a favourable time to take advantage of the terror which his sudden and unwelcome arrival had excited, to despatch a letter from the President of the United States to the dey, in order to afford him a fair opportu nity to open a negotiation. The captain of the port was immediately despatched to the Guerriere, on the receipt of this letter, accompanied by Mr. Norderling the Swedish consul ; and commodore Decatur, who, with Mr. Shaler, had been empowered to negotiate a treaty, proposed the basis, on which alone he could consent to enter on the affair of an adjustment. This was the absolute and unqualified relinquishment of any demand of tribute on the part of the regency, on any pretence whatever. To this he demurred. He was then asked if he knew what had become of the Algerine squadron, and replied \u2014 \" By this time it is safe, in some neutral port.\" \" Not the whole of it,\" was the reply. He was then told of the capture of the frigate, of the brig, and of the death of Hammida. He shook his head, and smiled with a look of incredu lity, supposing it a mere attempt to operate on his fears, and thus induce an acceptance of the proposed basis. But when the lieutenant of Hammida was called in, and the minister learned the truth of these particulars, he became completely unnerved, and agreed to nego tiate on the proposed basis. He premised, however, that he was not authorized to conclude a treaty, but requested the American commissioners to state the conditions they had to proDose. This was done, and"], [264, "256 NAVAL BATTLES. the captain of the port then requested a cessation of hostilities, and that the negotiation should be conduct ed on shore, the minister of marine having pledged himself for their security while there, and their safe return to the ships whenever they pleased. Neither of these propositions were accepted, and the captain was expressly given to understand, that not only must the negotiation be carried on in the Guerriere, but that hostilities would still be prosecuted against all vessels belonging to Algiers, until the treaty was signed by the dey. The captain of the port and Mr. Norderling then went on shore, but the next day again came on board, with the information that they were commissioned by the dey, to treat on the basis for which the com missioners of the United States had stipulated. A treaty was then produced, which the commissioners declared could not be varied in any material article, and that consequently, discussion was not only useless, but dangerous on their part ; for if in the interim the Algerine squadron were to appear, it would most as suredly be attacked. On examining the treaty pro posed, the captain of the port was extremely anxious to get the article stipulating for the restoration of the property taken by the Algerines during the war dispensed with, earnestly representing that it had been distributed into many hands, and that as it was not the present dey who declared war, it was unjust that he should answer for all its consequences. The article was, however, adhered to by the American com missioners, and after various attempts to gain a truce, as well as to gain time, it was at length settled"], [265, "257 NAVAL BATTLES. that all hostilities should instantly cease, when a boat was seen coming off with a white flag, the Swedish consul pledging at the same time his honour that it should not be hoisted until the dey had sign ed the treaty, and the prisoners were safe in the boat. The captain and Mr. Norderling then went on shore, and returned within three hours ; with the treaty signed, together with all the prisoners, al though the distance was more than five miles. The principal articles in this treaty were, that no tribute under any pretext or in any form whatever, should ever be required by Algiers from the United States of America \u2014 that all Americans in slavery should be given up without ransom \u2014 that compensation should be made for American vessels captured, or pro perty seized or detained at Algiers \u2014 that the persons and property of American citizens found on board an enemy's vessels should be sacred \u2014 that vessels of either partj putting into port should be supplied with provisions at market price, and, if necessary to be repaired, should land their cargoes without paying duty \u2014 that if a vessel belonging to either party should be cast on shore, she should not be given up to plunder \u2014 or if attacked by an enemy within can non shot of a fort, should be protected, and no ene my be permitted to follow her when she went to sea within twenty-four hours. In general, the rights of Americans on the ocean and land, were fully pro vided for in every instance, and it was particularly stipulated that all citizens of the United States taken in war, should be treated as prisoners of war are 33"], [266, "258 NAVAL BATTLES. treated by other nations, and not as slaves, but held subject to an exchange without ransom. After con- cluding this treaty, so highly honourable and advan- tageous to this country, the commissioners gave up1 the captured frigate and brig, to their former-owners. To this they were influenced by a consideration of the great expense it would require to put them in a condition to be sent to the United States \u2014 the im- possibility of disposing of them in the Mediterranean and by the pressing instances of the dey himself, who earnestly represented that this would be the best method of satisfying his people with the treaty just concluded, and consequently the surest guaran- tee for its observance on his part. The policy of the measure we' think sufficiently obvious, when it is considered that the dey would most likely, in case of their refusal, have fallen a victim to the indigna- tion of the people, and that, in all probability, his successor would have found his safety only in disown- ing the peace which had been made by his predeces- sor. There being, as we before stated, some dispute with the Spanish authorities with regard to the le- gality of the capture of the Algerine brig, it was stip- ulated on the part of the American commissioners, in order to induce the Spaniards to give her up, that the Spanish consul and a Spanish merchant, then prisoners in Algiers, should be released, and permit- ted to return to Spain if they pleased. According to the last advices the brig was still detained by the Spanish government, and the ultimate disposal of this vessel will probably be settled by an amicable negotiation."], [267, "259 NAVAL BATTLliS. Commodore Decatur despatched captain Lewis in the Epervier, bearing the treaty to the United States, and leaving Mr. Shaler at Algiers, as consul-general to the Barbary states, proceeded with the rest of the squadron to Tunis, with the exception of two schooners under captain Gamble, sent to convoy the Algerine vessels home from Carthagena. He was prompted to this visit, by having been informed that a misunderstanding existed between our consul and the bashaw of Tunis, into the nature of which he considered himself bound in duty to inquire. Here he was officially informed by the consul of a violation of the treaty subsisting between the United States and the bashaw, first, in permitting two prizes of an American privateer to be taken out of the harbour by a British cruiser, and secondly, in permitting a company of merchants, subjects of Tunis, to take the property of an American citizen at their own price, and much below its real value. The truth of these allegations being thus officially verified, commodore Decatur addressed a letter to the prime minister of Tunis, demanding satisfaction for these outrages exercised or permitted by the bashaw, and a full restoration of the property thus given up or sacrificed. The bashaw, through the medium . of his prime minister, acknowledged the truth of the facts, as well as the justice of the de mands ; but begged twelve months to pay the money. This was refused ; and on receiving assurances that it would be paid forthwith, the commodore went on shore, where he received the visits of the different"], [268, "260 NAVAL BATTLES. consuls. The brother of the prime minister of Tunis chanced to arrive with the money at this time, and seeing the British consul in conversation with com modore Decatur, threw down the bags which con tained it with great indignation, at the same- time ad^ dressing the consul in English, which he spoke, fluent ly, \" You see, sir, what Tunis is obliged to pay for your insolence. You must feel ashamed of the disgrace you have brought upon us. You are very good friends now, but I ask you whether you think it just first to violate our neutrality, and then to leave us to be destroyed, or pay for your aggressions.\" As soon as the money was paid, the bashaw prepared to despatch a minister to England, to demand the amount which he had been obliged to pay in conse quence of this requisition of the American commodore. After adjusting these differences, the squadron proceeded to Tripoli, where commodore Decatur made a similar demand for a similar violation of the treaty subsisting between the United States and the bashaw, who had permitted two American vessels to be taken from under the guns of his castle by a Brit ish sloop of war, and refused protection to an Amer ican cruiser lying within his jurisdiction. Restitu tion of the full value of these vessels was demanded, and the money, amounting to twenty-five thousand dol lars, paid by the bashaw into the hands of the Amer can consul. After the conclusion of this affair, the American consular flag, which Mr. Jones, the consul, i f v '\u2022 'nek, in consequence of the violation of neutral- Sty shove mentioned, was hoisted in the presence of"], [269, "NAVAL BATTLES. 261 the foreign agents, and saluted from the castle with thirty-one guns. In addition to the satisfaction thus obtained for unprovoked aggressions, the commodore had the pleasure of obtaining the release of ten cap tives, two Danes, and eight Neapolitans, the latter of whom he landed at Messina. After touching at Messina and Naples, the squad- ron sailed for Carthagena on the 31st of August, where commodore Decatur was in expectation of meeting the relief squadron, under commodore Bain- bridge. On joining that officer at Gibraltar, he re- linquished his command, and sailed in the Guerriere for the United States, where he arrived on the 12th of November, 1815. Every thing being done previ- ous to the arrival of the second division of the squad- ron, under commodore Bainbridge, that gallant, officer had no opportunity of distinguishing himself, as we are satisfied he always will where occasion occurs. Pursuant to his instructions he exhibited this addition- al force before Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, where they were somewhat surprised at the appearance of the Independence seventy-four, having always been persuaded that the United States were restricted by their treaties with England from building ships of that class. When colonel Lear was consul at Algiers he endeavoured to convince the ministers of the dey that such was not the case ; but they always replied, \" If you are permitted to build seventy-fours, let us see one of them and we shall be satisfied.\" Com modore Bainbridge sailed from Gibraltar thirty-six hours before the Guerriere, and arrived at Boston the 15th of November."], [270, "262 NAVAL BATTLES. Thus was concluded an expedition in which, though few, perhaps no opportunities occurred for a display of the hardy prowess of our sailors, the na tion acquired singular honour, in humbling and chas tising a race of lawless pirates, who have long been the inveterate scourges of the christian world. Inde pendently of the glory thus accruing to the republi can name, the probable advantages arising from this sudden and unlooked-for appearance of an American squadron immediately after a war, with Great Bri tain, we think will be manifold. This circumstance will give them an idea of the power and resources of the United States altogether different from that which they before entertained ; and serve to con vince them of the danger of provoking their resent ment under any expectation of the destruction of their navy by any power whatever. That the as surance of an immediate war with England was what principally encouraged the dey of Algiers to com mence hostilities against the United States, under a conviction that our little navy would speedily , be annihilated, is evident from the following fact. One of the dey's officers one morning insinuated, whether true or false we cannot say, to the British consul at Algiers, that it was his fault that they declared war. \" You told us,\" said he, \" that the American navy would be destroyed in six months by you, and now they make war upon us with two of your own ves sels they have taken from you !\""], [271, "NAVAL POETRY.

Their kindness the hearts of their captives subdued, Who sunk 'neath their arms when the life-streams were flowing And their conquest-wove wreaths not a tear has bedew'd But that which Humanity smiles in bestowing;"], [283, "275 NAVAL BATTLES. TUS The world with one voice bids their country rejoice, As with blushes it owns that these sons of her choice For valour and feeling have gain'd the rich prize, And stand first midst the first that live under the skies. Their splendid achievements shall long string the nerves Of all who the blessings of freemen inherit; And theirs be the honours such merit deserves, And dear to each bosom their death-daring spirits; The poet's best strain, shall their mem'ries maintain, And affection embalm them to Time's latest reign, While roused by their praises, our sons shall aspire, To rival their actions and glow with their fire. THE FRIGATE CONSTITUTION. \u2022UNO BEFORE THE CORPORATION OF THE CITT OF NEW YORK, FOURTH OF JULY, 1815. BY FRANCIS ARDEN, ESQ.. Argo of Greece, that brought the fleece To the Thessalian city, As we are told, by bards of old, Was sung in many a ditty; But Yankees claim a prouder name To spur their resolution, Than Greece could boast and do her most \u2014 The frigate Constitution. When first she press'd the stream's cool breast, Hope hail'd her pride of story; Now she o'erpays hope's flatt'ring praise, By matchless deeds of glory;"], [284, "276 NAVAL BATTLES. Of all that roam the salt sea's foam, None floats to Neptune dearer, Or fairer shines in fame's bright lines, Or more makes Britain fear her. 'Neath Hull's command, with a tough band And nought beside to back her, Upon a day, as log-books say, A fleet bore down to thwack her; A fleet, you know, is odds or so, Against a single ship sirs; So cross the tide, her legs she tried, And gave the rogues the slip sirs. But time flies round, and soon she found, While ploughing ocean's acres, An even chance to join the dance, And turn keel up, poor Dacres; Dacres, 'tis clear, despises fear, Quite full of fun and prank is, Hoists his ship's name, in playful game, Aloft to scare the Yankees. On Brasil's coast, she rul'd the roast, When Bainbridge was her captain; Neat hammocks gave, made of the wave, Dead Britons to be wrapp'd in; For there, in ire, 'midst smoke and fire, Her boys the Java met sirs, And in the fray, her Yankee play, Tipp'd Bull a Somerset sirs. Next on her deck, at Fortune's beck, The dauntless Stewart landed; A better tar ne'er shone in war, Or daring souls commanded;"], [285, "277 NAVAL BATTLES. LADY. Old Ironsides, now once more rides, In search of English cruisers; And Neptune grins, to see her twins, Got in an hour or two, sirs. Then raise amain, the joyful strain, For well she has deserv'd it, Who brought the foe so often low, Cheer'd freedom's heart and nerv'd it; Long may she ride, our navy's pride, And spur to resolution; And seamen boast, and landsmen toast, The FRIGATE CONSTITUTION FROM THE BALTIMORE WHIG. THE UNCOURTEOUS KNIGHT, AND THE COURTEOUS For a nautical knight, a lady \u2014 heigho ! Felt her heart and her heart-strings to ache; To view his sweet visage she look'd to and fro; \u2014 The name of the knight, was James Lucas Yeo, And the lady \u2014 'twas she of the Lake. \" My good, sweet sir James,\" cried the lady so fair, \" Since my passion I cannot control, When you see my white drapery floating in air, Oh! thither, and quickly I prithee repair And indulge the first wish of my soul.\" Sir knight heard afar, of the lady's desire, And sprightly and gay made reply \u2014 \" As your heart, lovely maid, doth my presence require, I assure you mine burns with an answering fire, And quick to your presence I'll fly.\""], [286, "278 NAVAL BATTLES. From Ontario's margin the lady set sail, To meet the bold knight on that sea: She dreamt not that he in his promise would fail, And leave a fair lady alone to bewail; \u2014 Yet no knight far or near could she see. mpatient to meet him no longer she'd stay, Resolv'd o'er the waters to roam: \u2022'' Oh! say, have you heard of my brave knight I pray, He promis'd to meet a fair lady to day, But I fear he's to Kingston gone home.\" At last she espied him \u2014 what could sir knight do ? He fidgetted \u2014 ran \u2014 and he tack'd in and out, And kept far aloof \u2014 yet he promised to woo; She hail'd him \u2014 \" Sir knight \u2014 wont you please to heave to What a shame a fair lady to flout.\" But away ran sir knight \u2014 the lady in vain, Her oglings, and glances employ 'd; She aim'd at his heart, he aim'd at her brain, She vow'd from pursuing she'd never refrain; And the knight was most sadly annoy'd. At length from the lady, the knight got him clear, And obtain'd for a season some rest; But if the fair lady he ever comes near, For breaking his promise he'll pay pretty dear\u2014 The price captain Chauncey knows best."], [287, "LIST OF THE AMERICAN NAVY FOR 1831 g Names of Vessels.
