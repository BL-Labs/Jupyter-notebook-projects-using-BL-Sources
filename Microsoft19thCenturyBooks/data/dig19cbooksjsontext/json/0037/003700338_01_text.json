ROGER SWIFT, a kindly tempered, easy-going gentleman, long past his first youth, but not turned fifty-five, was taking an evening stroll and smoke just outside his own iron gates on a sultry night in July. Though his house was an hour's distance by railway from London, he was a City man accustomed to run up to his office every morning and return to Water Basset in time for dinner. The day had been hot, and business, though he was a prosperous man and took life easily, had been an oppression which made him more disposed to linger in the soft, sweet summer dusk, among country sounds and scents, the rattle of the land-rail, the croak of a frog, the fragrant breath of hay and honeysuckle. Another reason for"], [12, "8 Vashti Savage. prolonging his stroll was that, while he was a family man, his wife was dead and none of the elder children, to whom he was the most indulgent of fathers, had ever taken the mother's place as his confidential friend and companion. The stable clock struck ten, warning him that it was time for him to throw away the end of his cigar and make for his lodge-gate, if he did not wish to be locked out by his own gate-keeper. He had been walking in the direction of a rough bit of common land which lay not far from where his park wall ended. As he faced about and proceeded to retrace his steps, he was struck by the cloudy darkness, probably pre ceding a storm, which threatened to render his wall and gate in the shadow of the overhanging trees well-nigh indistinguishable. \" Hallo ! what on earth is that ? \" he called out in surprise the next moment, as something or somebody coming up behind him with a rush struck him in passing, rebounded from the sharp contact, missed its footing, and fell rolling over from the side path into the main road. He sprang forward, too late to prevent the accident, and picked up a young girl, half child, half girl by her gait and gestures, who had been running at the top of her speed, and now struggled violently in his grasp. \"Let me go!\" she panted; \"let me be ! I bean't"], [13, "A Wild Creature Fleeing in the Night. 9 doing no harm, but I'm mortal feared, I is, that he'll catch me, and wallop me next. I mun bite and scratch if so be you'll keep me.\" She suited the action to the words, darting with her nails and teeth at the hands which held her. He caught her by the wrists and forced her head aside. \" You little wild cat ! where do you hail from, and what mischief are you about, running like that in the darkness when every respectable child is in bed ? \" \" I ain't respectable ! \" shrieked the girl, \" and I ain't a child. I ha' helped to make and sell skewers, and pins, and traps, and nets, and baskets ; and I ha' telled fortunes at the fairs for years. I'm turned twelve, and mother was married at fourteen \u2014 her told me. Oh ! mother, mother, has father done for you this time ? I seed blood running black, like the ditch water, and the whites o' your eyes a' turning up by the light o' the lamp. Let me go \u2014 let me go ! If you wunnot, I'll throttle you ! \" At the horror of the picture she had drawn she shrieked with renewed vigour, made a spring at his throat, and fought desperately to free herself. \" I cannot let you go, my girl, till I hear more of what has happened to scare you, and know what is to become of you, and where you are to find shelter for the night,\" said Roger Swift, not unkindly, and not unmoved by the frantic agitation of the creature he"], [14, "Vashti Savage. 10 had captured. \" Have you been mixed up in a row ? Is a woman \u2014 your mother hurt ? Look here ; it will do no good for you to yell and pitch into me. Better tell your story, and see if assistance can be got. My lodge is within sight, if it were not as dark as Erebus ; it is the nearest house. You ought to be in somebody's care. You're a girl, and not a boy. I've girls of my own, and know what they should be like.\" \" I ain't like your girls ! \" cried the culprit. \" No, indeed,\" said Roger Swift under his breath ; then he added aloud, \" You're of too tender an age to be scouring the country in the middle of the night, though you may have run off to get out of the way of a free fight.\" \" I bean't skeared,\" she said, half sullenly, half proudly ; \" leastways, it ain't the night that has skeared me. I ha' tramped with father and mother, and I ha' tramped mysen on mother's errands to the nearest house, i' the dark, a power o' nights. Laws ! the dark ain't amiss to them as can see before their noses.\" \" Don't be satirical, my young friend.\" \" What do stirical be ? Has it aught to do with picking and stealing ? I bean't a thief. As God a' mighty sees me \" \" Hush ! hush ! Nobody is accusing you ; but if you use, or rather abuse, sacred names in that fashion, I'll suspect you of the whole petty larceny committed"], [15, "A Wild Creature Fleeing in the Night. 11 by your tribe. You have come out of one of the gipsy tents pitched out on the Scrub there ? \" She had submitted to his superior strength, and was consenting to walk quietly beside him, his right hand grasping her left wrist, but by the quick glances she cast in all directions, accompanied by sudden jerks of her body and half-suppressed springs of her limbs, he was satisfied that she would make off from him on the first opportunity. \" There bean't but one tent on the Scrub, and that's our'n,\" she said, a little disdainful of his ignorance. \" If there had been a heap o' tents, I would ha' run to one o' they.\" He could not see anything further of her in the dusk than that she was a small, dark slip of humanity, who might be a stunted girl of twelve or a tallish child of ten. He had a notion that the wardrobe on her back, doubtless the only one she possessed, was scant and ragged ; but the impression he received might owe a great deal to both memory and asso ciation. He had often seen the waggons and tents of the nomads, half gipsies, half tramps, that were wont at certain seasons, in spite of the opposition of the respectable natives, to dot Basset Scrub ; and he had a general familiarity with their population of picturesque, slouching vagabonds of men and boys, and untidy, tattered women and children."], [16, "Vashti Savage. 12 \" What's your name ? \" he asked of his prisoner. \" Vash,\" she answered briefly. \" Vache,\" he repeated, with a ring of laughter in his voice, for though he was kindly he was merry-hearted to excess, and could hardly help finding pleasantry and jests in every subject under the sun. \" That is a queer name,\" he went on ; \" besides, I thought it was horses, not cows, that your people dealt in.\" \" What do you mean by cows ? \" she asked sharply. \" Vash is a queen's name, Vash is.\" \" Oh,\" he said, \" I have you now, Vashti ! I hope you are not going to copy your royal namesake in your defiance of the powers that be.\" \" I ain't up to your meaning,\" said Vashti, with assumed carelessness, rather as if it was her choice and not her misfortune to fail to understand him. \" She corned from the East, where we corned from, where the stars corned from.\" \"And you are her descendant, no doubt? \" \" I ain't clear what 'cendant is,\" said Vashti candidly. \" Oh, her daughter once or twice removed.\" \" We be king's childer \u2014 leastways father is. As for mother, her were low-born, come of tinker-tramps. I've heard father tell her that, afore he whacked her.\" \"Was he in the habit of paying her that delicate piece of attention \u2014 I mean, of whacking her ? \" \" Most every day,\" answered Vashti, with the cool-"], [17, "A Wild Creature Fleeing in the Night. 13 ness of a person to whom a startling incident has become trite by frequent repetition. \" Sometimes it were with a broom ; he gied her a black eye with that.\" \"You don't say so!\" protested Roger, making up his mind on the spot that the girl was exaggerating. \" That was last week,\" Vashti proceeded methodi cally. \"Sometimes it were with his stick. He lamed her right arm wi' thatten a month agone. But to-night it were with the axe that he uses to split the wood, and her were bleeding like a sheep.\" \" Hold your tongue ! \" cried good-natured Roger Swift indignantly, unable to stand any more of the tale of sickening brutality. \" You must be talking nor. sense ; you know you must. At the same time,\" he said, more to himself than to her, \"we must have this affair looked into, or we'll have murder committed within our bounds. I have the honour to hold Her Majesty's commission as a justice of the peace, and it will not do to let such barbarities pass unchecked.\" \" Be you the hangman ? \" asked Vashti inquisitively. \" Uncle Wisdom 'a' told father scores o' times he'll never rest till he's in the hangman's hands.\" \" No, my functions are not quite the same as those of the gentleman you mention,\" said Roger, yielding to what he described afterwards as an irresistible inclina tion to talk tall language to the waif, she was so in-"], [18, "Vashti Savage. 14 tolerably self-sustained and dignified. \"What is your other name besides Vashti ? \" \" I hain't no other name.\" \" A convenient deficiency for one of your sex,\" he remarked lightly. \" You won't need to change a name which has never existed when a certain interesting occasion occurs.\" n \"You're greening me,\" said the object petulantly. \" I won't be greened.\" \" What will you do ? What happens when you are greened against your will ? \" \" I lies down and kicks and yells.\" \" But you are a great deal too old for that, and you are a remarkably forward girl for your age. You ought to be ashamed of yourself for doing anything of the kind.\" \"Them as greens me ought to be ashamed of their selves.\" \"You're not far wrong; you hit me there, Miss Vashti. But here we are at the Lodge.\" He took her within the gate, and inside the door of a mock Swiss cottage, both gate and door still standing open as he had left them an hour before. Their entrance was not accomplished without an unavailing attempt on her part to twist herself out of his clutch, double, and flee again into the darkness out of which she had come. \"None of that,\" he told her; \"you must do what I"], [19, "\" HERE, MRS. RUST, I'VE BROUGHT YOU AN ODD NIGHT-BIRD \" (p. 17)."], [20, ""], [21, "A Wild Creature Fleeing in the Night. 17 wish ; everybody does that here. You and I are going to be friends, Vashti. Why, we've been quite confi dential as it is, and I flatter myself have edified and entertained each other while we came along. Here, Mrs. Rust, I've brought you an odd night-bird, and you must find a place for her to roost in till morning, when we'll see what truth there is in the sensational tale she tells, and what is to be done with her.\" He was standing in the cheery, comfortable house place of a well-to-do gamekeeper's cottage ; which the bright fire on the hearth lit up, from the eight-day clock to the chest of mahogany drawers, from the stuffed owl in a case above the chimney-piece to the carefully trimmed and flourishing geranium in full flower in a pot on the window-sill. When he came in he had found the room empty; but his entrance had brought from an inner room a fresh-coloured elderly woman, as tidy as her kitchen and sitting-room in one, in spite of the ugly fashion of having her grey hair in a brown net, and of wearing no white collar round her throat, not even such a white neckerchief under her stuff gown as her grandmother would have shown. Her eyes were not blinking with the sudden transit from darkness to firelight, and were fully open to the miserable descrip tion of child Roger Swift was thrusting forward. She was a perfect scarecrow of a dark-skinned, ill-grown girl, with unkempt locks under a torn hat, and as torn 2"], [22, "Vashti Savage. 18 a frock, which was also so faded and stained that its original colour was lost. She had the merest pretence at shoes, down at heel and out at toe, betraying the bare feet, which were not nearer coffee-colour and more begrimed than the bare hands and throat, that went along with the feet. \" Oh my ! Mr. Swift,\" cried Mrs. Rust, speaking in the tone of respectful remonstrance which a good and favoured servant will not hesitate to adopt to an easy going, kind-hearted master, reckoned by his subordinates rash and thoughtless for his years. \" Whatever has made you do this ? You've gone and picked up a gipsy brat from one of them tents on the Scrub, and all them young poultry and game, as I won't name more particular in present company, going about. You may lock up your gun afore the shooting season comes round, and it will be a good thing if we ain't all robbed and murdered in our beds. I don't know what Rust will say when he comes in.\" \" Tut, tut, Mrs. Rust,\" said her master, looking rather shame-faced, \" don't be a prophetess of evil. Smooth down Rust as you best know how. Besides, I could not help myself. The child was scurrying past me like the wind when she tripped and fell. I caught hold of her to help her up, and tried to stop her and find where she was running to in such a desperate hurry at this time of the night. I can tell you it took me all my"], [23, "A Wild Creature Fleeing in the Night. 19 strength to keep her from breaking loose. She was wild with fright at what must have been a fight in her tent, though, according to her, it is a daily occurrence. It must be seen to and put a stop to, in the name of humanity,\" he went on, speaking in the public interest. \" In the meantime, the girl isn't fit to go to Wood Basset, or Crownleigh, or wherever she was bound for. She is little older than Miss Prissy. It would have been a shame and scandal to have left her out in the road or the fields, with night and a storm coming on. Tell Rust that.\" Mrs. Rust listened doubtfully and disapprovingly, though she was too well-bred a servant, and Mr. Swift, with all his tolerant, compliant way, was too well aware that he was master in his own domain, and too well accustomed to exercise his authority \u2014 quietly and jocu larly, perhaps, but still unquestionably \u2014 for her to do more than say, \" Well, sir, I believe you had better have left a young gipsy alone. Trust her and her people to know the whole country as well by night as by day, and some of the cattle would be sure to be near her or to overtake her before long. Satan knows his own, if you will forgive me for using such a word. No fear of a young gipsy wench coming to grief with being out in the dark. As for her story, you may make up your mind it was a parcel of the monstrous lies which they live by telling.\""], [24, "Vashti Savage. 20 \"No, it weren't a lie,\" spoke up Vashti, hitherto quiescent, startling the speakers, who were perforce dis cussing her position and credibility in her hearing. Her manner was eager and resolute, but it had none of the indignation and pain with which one might have expected that she would deny the charge of falsehood brought against her. \" Though in course I can lie.\" \" Hear till her ! \" interpolated the shocked Mrs. Rust. \"But I were speaking gospel truth to the gentleman,\" resumed the girl. \" Father ha' felled mother as he would ha' felled a' ox.\" Even the incredulous Mrs. Rust was a little im pressed by this statement. She might not reckon a gipsy woman her neighbour in ordinary circumstances, but it was another thing to stand by and look on or listen in cold blood while she was being murdered. \" She has told me that more than once, and sticks to her point,\" said Roger Swift, watching Mrs. Rust's face, and appreciating the effect produced by the idea of a wretched woman being treated as a dog is rarely treated. \" I have some notion that you should send Rust up to the house the moment he comes in, and that he and I, and perhaps Spiers or Wilson,\" naming his gardener and coachman, \" if I can get my hands on either of them, ought to start at once for the Scrub. We should get at the bottom of the tale, and rescue the woman if necessary.\""], [25, "A Wild Creature Fleeing in the Night. 21 Mrs. Rust's mind reverted instantly to its naturally cautious and distrustful habits. \"And have a score of gipsy men overpower you and my master, not to say Spiers and Wilson. Wilson is up in years, and Spiers is still lame of the hand he hacked chopping wood. I tied it up with Friar's balsam not three days agone. In the dead of the night a band of gipsies might do what they liked with you, though Rust is a powerful man, and you are still as active a gentleman as when you came to Water Basset. I don't go in with no such tempting of Providence, Mr. Swift, and my master sha'n't go with you on no such mad errand with my will,\" said Mrs. Rust, in violent opposition. She knew her duty, however, and felt bound to add, in a tone of disconsolate yet exasperated humility, \" But, in course, Rust is at your service.\" \" I'm not so sure of that,\" said her master, chaffing her ; for he was fain to reassure and comfort anybody he contradicted, and he frequently knew no better way of doing it than by chaffing his victim. \" Better stop till daylight, sir, and get the police to go with you. It is their business, and not yours and Rust's.\" \" I'm not certain that the poor woman will say so if she has to stand still and be mauled till it is morning, and till I can put the matter into the hands of the police \""], [26, "Vashti Savage. 22 \" It's nothing of the sort, sir, depend upon it. It's a tale to crave pity ; or it's a decoy to get you into mischief; or she's some drunken light-o'-the-head drab that has provoked her master beyond bearing, and only got what she deserved,\" wound up Mrs. Rust, with an air of superior virtue. \" Gipsy women do not drink, and they are so true to their marriage vows that to fall from them means degradation worse than death,\" Mr. Swift told her. \" They will dispute your call to go in upon them at this hour of the night. It is not as if it were day, when you might profess business and get round them, and learn whether there was such a woman and such a row, which I misdoubt,\" said Mrs. Rust doggedly. \" There is something in that \u2014 not the non-existence of the woman or the row, but the man's right to find fault with my demanding admittance to his tent without any authority or proper warrant after nightfall. I say, Judith, Rizpah \u2014 what do they call you ? Had your father left off beating your mother, or was he in the thick of it when you cut and run ? \" Vashti had been pricking up her ears and listening with all her might ; but though she was smart enough to take in the gist of the conversation, she showed neither alacrity nor pleasure at her champion's proposal to go at once to the scene of the family fray. On the contrary, she hung back in a manner which was"], [27, "A Wild Creature Fleeing in the Night. 23 very suspicious to Mrs. Rust and baffling to Mr. Swift. \" Father ha' done for this bout, and I ain't sure he bean't sorry by this time for knocking her about wi' the axe. She were lying down and coming to herself and wouldn't care to be disturbed,\" said Vashti slowly. No doubt the girl, in her ignorance and childishness, was still fully alive to what might be the consequences to herself of introducing a pair of strange men to her father's tent during the night, and shrank from the step. This was more than she had bargained for in her headlong flight and her vague search for help and a deliverer. \" I daresay your mother would not care to be disturbed,\" repeated Mrs. Rust ironically. \" Then we had better leave her to herself till morning,\" said Roger Swift cheerfully; \" and 'now I must make for my simple repast before I turn in for the night. You have simply been playing hankey pankey with my domestic arrangements, Miss Atalanta \u2014 do you know that ? \" \" I never made you play no such game, and I ain't 'Talanta ; I'se Vash,\" she declared in dudgeon. \"But what am I to do with this wild creature? You've never told me that, sir,\" pressed Mrs. Rust, following her master as he retreated precipitately to the door."], [28, "Vashti Savage. 24 \" That is for you to find out. I leave her to your good offices,\" he called back, with a twinkle in his eye and a silent chuckle. \" I have perfect faith in you, both as a humane woman and a woman of resource. You will not turn the vagrant out, and you will put her just where she should be.\" \" It is very good of you to say so, sir,\" said Mrs. Rust demurely but grimly ; she was not altogether unpropitiated by the compliment, but she was a match for the compliment payer. \" I should take it very kind of you if it were not just fair buttering me up ; and you'll perhaps tell me, since you've brought the trouble suddenly upon me, what you wish me to do, for I'm clean at my wits' end. You would not have me put a little scamp like that into my best bedroom, fit for any lady, with the dimity curtains bleached as white as driven snow, though I should not say it, and the boards bees'-waxed, and the cheyney shepherdess, with her dog as natural as life, that poor Miss Prissy were that fond on a year or two agone, decorating the mantel ?\" \" Put her where you like,\" sung out Roger Swift from the doorstep. \" Stuff her into any hole that is weather-tight. I don't suppose she is very nice, poor wandering soul. Give her bite and sup, and keep her safe till morning, that's all I ask of you, Mrs. Rust.\" \" I ain't going to stop here ! \" screamed Vashti. \" If I ain't let go my way, I'se come with you, master,"], [29, "A Wild Creature Fleeing in the Night. 25 rather than stop with she. I don't like the looks of her, and she hates me like pisen.\" \" Hold your tongue, Vashti,\" he hastily reprimanded her. \" Stay where you are. There are two at a bargain making. Besides, you're very well off where you are, if you only knew it. Keep her safe till morning, that's all I ask of you, Mrs. Rust.\" \"And it's a good bit to ask,\" she grumbled when he was gone ; \" and me a married woman, that has neither been pleased nor plagued with boys and girls of my own. More by token I had just tidied up, and prepared to sit down comfortable, with Rust's supper already on the hob, to have a young blackamoor heathen beggar fall down from the skies upon me, and it's all by the doing of the most oonreasonable of masters, that always gets his own way because nobody can make up his or her mind to say nothing to so pleasant-spoken and well-meaning a gentleman. You were a forward piece,\" turning upon Vashti, and address ing her severely, \" to propose to go up to the house with the likes of he, as ought never to have siled his fingers with the scum of the earth. What would Master Ben and poor Miss Prissy have thought of such a visitor ? But you weren't so far wrong neither to hang on by his coat-tails instead of catching hold of my skirts. For he was never the man to shake a poor body off unheard and unrelieved ; the greater the loss"], [30, "26 Vashti Savage. to him ! But I warn you, I can both deny you your will and give you a good shake, ay, and get Rust to take a stick to your back, if you do not behave till I've got rid of you.\" \" I'se be good ; I'se be good,\" promised Vashti in tears, considerably subdued. The fact was she was much nearer being overawed by Mrs. Rust's plain spoken threats than by Mr. Swift's mystifying raillery."], [31, "CHAPTER II. A DESCENDANT OF KINGS IN THE POOR-HOUSE. THE next day when Roger Swift delayed his daily journey to London in order to make an investiga tion at the Scrub, he was taken aback to find that there was not a single tent to be met with on the waste ground. He could see marks of wheels where a waggon had passed, holes from which the poles that had helped to convert the tilted-up waggon into a tent had been withdrawn, the charred embers of a recent fire, and a pathway trodden in the sand and clay to a neighbouring ditch. He could even detect with a gruesome sensation a dull-red, half-obliterated stain on the coarse grass and sand. The stain probably marked the slaughter-place of the ducks and geese, hens and turkeys, rabbits and hares, pheasants and partridges, by Which, according to popular prejudice, gipsies and tinkers come lightly; but it bore an ominous resemblance to the human blood which Vashti had represented as shed like water."], [32, "28 Vashti Savage. Mr. Swift could do nothing more that day ; he had to leave Vashti still longer a grievous burden on Mrs. Rust, who watched the girl and Mrs. Rust's spoons for twenty-four hours with sleepless vigilance. Further inquiries were of no avail beyond the ascertaining of one or two isolated\u00bbfacts. A small gipsies' waggon or van had been seen early in the morning on the road leading from Water Basset Scrub. The waggon, besides carrying the usual stock-in-trade of baskets, nets, wooden pegs, and skewers, with the primitive domestic utensils for the use of a primitive household, had appeared to contain only the man who was driving it. \" Can the ruffian have slain his wife outright at last, and buried her before he left the place ? \" specu lated Roger Swift, between horror and incredulity. But there was no vestige of a grave or of \" troubled earth,\" and there was no way, except the most round about road, to confirm his suspicions. Neither did the author of the suspicions see that much good would be got by it, except in bringing a guilty man to justice. That would come about without Mr. Swift's inter vention, and so far as the child's interests were con cerned, it would not help her to denounce her father on her report as a murderer. It was a much more pressing affair to dispose of Vashti, left on her captor's hands and professing utter ignorance of her father's movements, till her natural guardian returned to his"], [33, "A Descendant of Kings in the Poor-house. 29 customary haunts, which, if he were an innocent man, he was pretty sure to do. But even at the best a man who could let his daughter run wild by night, no less than by day, as Roger Swift had found her, and then, the moment she was missing, abandon her to her fate, was a sorry protector for any girl, rich or poor, wild or tame. She fretted at intervals over her mother's having been taken away from her, but the novelty of the situation distracted her attention. She did not seem to realise a fatal conclusion to the injuries which she said she had seen inflicted, neither did she appear impressed by the fact that her father was the inflicter. She might never have heard of the Divine right of kings, but she had evidently pronounced views on the Divine right of husbands, to the extent of their beating their domestic partners as they beat their ponies and donkeys, and of the men's compelling the women to follow their footsteps at any moment wherever they chose to go. \" It must have been father as broke up the encampment on the Scrub, and mother would ha' no choice but to go and leave me behind,\" she said composedly. \" I mun look out for mysen.\" Apart from her capacity to do this, she was probably better without the pair who had forsaken her ; and she must be sent to the workhouse. Even Roger Swift saw that clearly, though he had taken rather a fancy to the odd child. The state of nature in which she"], [34, "Vashti Savage. 30 was demanded such a systematic civilising and training as only a workhouse could accomplish. No village family of average moral worth, order, and cleanliness would suffer such an inmate under their roof long enough to furnish any hope of her redemption. The workhouse was not a favourite institution of Mr. Swift's, but his eyes were open to its advantages in the present case. Mrs. Rust was rendered all but beside herself by what she called Vashti's \" tricks and ongoings \" during the few days that she was a prisoner at the lodge. Its tidy mistress had naturally installed the intruder into the garret, where she could do least mischief; but though Mrs. Rust had taken this lawful precaution, she had not failed to provide her with the materials for common comfort and decency. She had made up such a bed for her as Mrs. Rust would be bound no gipsy brat had ever slept in before. She had brought her a pitcher of water and a basin for her ablutions ; she had taken up bread and cheese and a mutton-chop from Rust's supper. She would have offered her needles and thread, that she might repair her rags and tatters, but Mrs. Rust did not believe the vagabond could use needles and thread. Having done what she con sidered her duty, in obedience both to her master and her conscience, Mrs. Rust sat down ; and little as she expected gratitude, looked for some small result in"], [35, "A Descendant of Kings in the Poor-house. 31 that way ; and what was the sequel ? The young savage first smashed the window in an attempt to climb out on the thatch, which she found not feasible. Instead of using the water to wash with, she had amused herself by pouring it all over the floor, and it had soaked through the boards and made an ugly stain on the ceiling of Mrs. Rust's best room. She had gnawed the mutton-bone as a dog would have gnawed it, crumbled down all the bread and cheese which she had not eaten, left everything tossed about, and slept curled up on the floor in the middle of the mess, instead of on the Christian's bed which Mrs. Rust had prepared for her. At last, when her hostess opened the door and looked in on the havoc she had wrought, the imp grinned at Mrs. Rust's astonishment and consternation, till she looked the very image of one of the \" puggies \" that foreign beggars or organ men took about with them on their musical boxes. The matron of the workhouse would have her hands full, and no mistake ! Roger Swift was a man of mark and weight in the parish; among other offices which he held he was one of the guardians under the Poor Law, and was well known to the workhouse authorities. He determined to go himself with Vashti, lending her all the support which his presence and influence could supply. Vashti was, as some people say, quite agreeable to the expedition."], [36, "Vashti Savage. 32 She greatly enjoyed driving with Mr. Swift in his carriage, giggling at the rapid motion, hopping about, examining everything, and thrusting her head out of one or other of the carriage windows in so free and easy a manner that the owner of the carriage con gratulated himself on not having sent her to sit on the box. He had refrained partly lest an overpowering desire for freedom should seize her, and she should attempt to jump down and run away ; and partly in pure consideration for the ruffled dignity and injured feel ings of the coachman, already sufficiently aggrieved by having to drive such \"a bundle of muck\" as a little gipsy wench, even though she was shut up out of sight in company with his master. Vashti was struck by the workhouse after a fashion in which it strikes few of the applicants for its shelter. She had seen a jail, but not a workhouse close at hand before. \" Laws ! what a grand, big building, and how many winders. It would make hunders and hunders of our tent, and that has not got no winders \u2014 nobbut a door and a hole at the other end. Be it a palace where the Queen bides ? \" \" We might call it the palace of the poor,\" said Roger Swift temporisingly, \"if it had not been that some princely men up in London, where my Prissy used to think all the smoke came from, have built such a palace for the poor that this is like a sordid prison by comparison.\""], [37, "A Descendant of Kings in the Poor-house, n \" But it ain't a jile,\" remarked Vashti shrewdly ; \" there bean't gratings at the winders. Father were in jile at Maidstone last year for robbing a hen-roost, and being caught in the act. That were why he were jiled. Father ain't a fool, but it were main stoopid in him to let hissen be seen. Mother and me lived quiet, and travelled all the way to pay him a visit on visitors' day. That were rare genteel, I think. But you have not said whether the Queen ever bides here ? \" \" No,\" he said plainly ; \" I cannot say that any kings or queens take up their abode here, unless it be those kings and queens of the East with whom you claim kindred.\" \" My ! it do be white and clean,\" Vashti cried in wonder and delight, as the pair were admitted. \" Sure, some o' them there kings and queens mun be here. Will they know the likes o' me, do you think ? I wish I had got time to borrow mother's yaller glass-beads and the red neckercher she ties round her head at fairs.\" Vashti was equally delighted with the workhouse uniform. The blue-and-white check, the little plaid shawls, the caps and bonnets of the women, the white fustians of the men, the calico frocks and pinafores of the children, were all grandeur to Vashti. \" Mother and father would ha' looked like a real lady and gemman if they had wore such clothes. Am 3"], [38, "Vashti Savage. 34 I to wear them ? Sha'n't I be smart ? Will you stay and see me?\" she inquired of Mr. Swift, as the sole acquaintance there who had known her in her chrysalis days. He had taken care to tell her that he was going to leave her behind him, and she had not seemed to mind it, so elated was she by her promotion to work house quarters. But she had not bargained for a couple of nurses leading her off to a bath, and she made a great hullabaloo when her hair was cut, stamp ing and screaming, shouting that she was not going to be shorn like a sheep. She would keep her hair \u2014 her bonnie black hair, as many a lady would be proud of. True gipsies never cut their hair ; it was a mark that they came of kings. The sacrifice was wrung from her by force, and the indignity and discomfort to her, from being washed and having her hair cut short, outweighed the attraction of the clean whole workhouse suit in which she was presently invested. Roger Swift was sorry when, having stayed for a time chatting with the officials, he was called in to try to quiet his protegee. He found her strutting up and down, raging and occasionally spitting at her enemies, the whole performance contrasting strongly with the badge of pauperism and dependence in her dress. In workhouse guise he found her a thin, nut-brown girl, with some pretensions to the delicate, slightly Jewish cast of features of a gipsy, considerably interfered with"], [39, "A Descendant of Kings in the Poor-house. 35 by a turned-up instead of a hooked nose, and by her dark eyes having a decided cast. \" What is her name ? \" inquired the governor, with reference to its entry in the books. \" Vashti is her Christian name \u2014 not that I suppose she has been christened. She does not know her surname, or else she will not give it,\" said Mr. Swift, acting as her sponsor. \" Very likely it is Smith,\" suggested the other \u2014 \"lots of Smiths among the gipsies.\" \" I think Savage would be more appropriate,\" said Roger Swift, contemplating the swelling, quivering figure and the eyes rolling and squinting in bootless rage. \"Then Savage be it,\" acquiesced the complacent governor. \" We have entered foundlings with the sur name of the day of the week or the name of the road on which they were found.\" So Vashti was written Vashti Savage in the books of the workhouse, with the title sticking to her, and a savage she proved herself, for many a da}'. At first her absolute lawlessness, her total lack of scruple or fear, recommended itself in the light of a novelty in the large establishment in which, as in other great establishments \u2014 courts and camps and so forth \u2014 the plague of monotony was apt to be felt. The ordinary pauper children within the workhouse walls were not"], [40, "Vashti Savage. 36 t all alike ; but they were as a rule cowed and cringing. Their bodies showed the result of former under-feeding, over-crowding and neglect, in stunted growth and the prevalence of ophthalmia and hip-disease. Their minds displayed a similar process of deterioration, conspicuous in which was the listlessness or apathy, with the sullen, secretive, deceitful temper, which a great authority, and one devoted to the service of pauper children, has pointed out as a marked feature in the class. Vashti was dauntless and daring, bold to audacity, and thoroughly destitute of so much as the knowledge of any principle which could restrain her. She owned neither the obligations nor the restraints of civilised life. If left to herself, she would have done what she liked and taken what she fancied, irrespective of the rights of mine and thine ; just as she would have eaten when she was hungry, drank when she was thirsty, and lain down and slept when she was tired, with no reference to set meal-times, not even to the grand primitive divisions of day and night. She did not see the necessity for such bonds and fetters, and in old expressive English phraseology, they \"irked\" her in tolerably. At first, before the patience of masters, mistresses, and companions was too much tired out, there was a certain fascination and considerable entertainment to be found in her strange ways, and her futile attempts at"], [41, "A Descendant of Kings in the Poor-house. 37 openly defying in her single small person an organised system of control as extensive as it was complicated. Her impudent slyness balanced her recklessness, and weighed against her frantic struggles to escape from the discipline enforced on a multitude of older and wiser people, though they were but paupers in a pauper refuge. Night after night, when the lights were put out, she wriggled herself noiselessly out of bed, and curled her- self up on the floor, or crept under the bed in preference to sleeping on a mattress \"like a Christian.\" She slipped perpetually off the schoolroom benches to establish herself a la Turque on the boards. When her tongue was let loose, she enlarged on the delight of lying on straw, seeing the sun shine or the rain fall by day, and the moon and the stars glimmer through the open tent door or the holes of the canvas by night. She did not mind cold or heat or wet ; she was as hardy and hardened as one of the Scrub donkeys. She soon pined to stray at will, as she had been accustomed to do at all hours, along the hedge-rows, and by the field paths, taking a nap behind a hay-stack, pulling turnips and tearing at them with her strong young teeth, convinced that they were as good as the apples and pears pilfered from the orchards she passed, gather ing bean-pods, seeking nests \u2014 not merely plovers' and wild pigeons' nests, but those of hens and ducks, turkeys"], [42, "38 Vashti Savage. and geese, in every unguarded poultry-yard and goose green. Vashti was an adept at sucking eggs through the smallest hole, and then carefully depositing the empty shell where she had found the full one, with keen appreciation of the sardonic jest. Even the dusty or miry high-roads were not to be despised, when they led to the large towns, on the out skirts of which, within the reflection of the brilliant rows of street lamps, a resting-place was found for the waggon. The owner then drove a roaring trade in baskets and nets, pegs and skewers, and fortune-telling under the rose ; while for the girl there were the wonderful shop windows to gape and stare at, the crowds of all sorts and conditions of men to thread her way through, with tastes of such treats of \" shows, \" circuses, and penny theatres as she could not command in the country. Lawlessness and vagabondage, whether rustic or urban, have many charms to one born and bred to them, unacquainted with anything else, especially with the significance of the word \"duty,\" and still possessing youth and youth's strength and buoyancy in perfection. Stunted and meagre as Vashti Savage was, her muscle was firm as a rock, her nerves were tough as bow strings. She laughed at fatigue just as she laughed at the soft indulgences of civilisation. When she played with the workhouse children, she not only out-ran, out-"], [43, "A Descendant of Kings in the Poor-house. 39 skipped, out-threw the ball, where all were concerned, she wore them out in no time when they were stirred up to try to emulate her fantastic gambols, and then shrieked with laughter at their collapse. She hated to be called to meals, sulked, said she was sick, and left three-fourths of her breakfast, dinner, and supper untouched. After rejecting wholesome food which was free to her, she would be detected appropriating and eating forbidden garbage, which a dainty dog or a well-fed pig would have scorned ; and no pantry was safe from her ; she stole in and stole out, dived here and leapt there, and ran like a lapwing with her prize. She planned and watched her opportunities for hours and hours, as if she had been an accomplished burglar or a Red Indian. She filched and secreted keys for the mere mischief of the thing, hid away booty which she never intended to use in the most unimaginable hiding-places, and was never so happy as when the milk-jug, which ought to have been full, was discovered three-fourths empty, and the loaves of bread appeared with great holes in them. Scoldings and lectures, solitary confinement, being kept without food for a day, passed over her as lightly as a summer shower, for which she would not, unless she was forced, put up an umbrella ; when it came to that, umbrellas were her scorn and derision still more than sun-shades. These made her look gay and gaudy ; and Vashti, like her"], [44, "Vashti Savage. 40 sister savages, whilst she was the most incurably untidy of workhouse girls, who not only wore and wasted, but deliberately and wickedly tore and de stroyed the clothes which she had at first admired for their strange cleanness and wholesomeness, entertained a certain love for what was brilliant and gorgeous. But she was not enough of a woman for this taste to come out in her in any marked degree, so as to serve as a means, where means were scarce, of pleasing or displeasing her, and so getting at the soul that was in her through the human element of rewards and punishments. Such rewards and punishments as the workhouse could offer were alike trifles light as air to Vashti. She did not care a straw for either. Upon the whole, she rather preferred the punishments, because her cool endurance and absolute relish for them awoke the other girls' amazement \u2014 a sentiment which partook both of awe and admiration. Vashti had fled in terror from the dread of her father's cruel blows, and while she was subject to them they had kept her in subordination. But no workhouse in Great Britain would have inflicted a tithe of his treatment on the slightest provocation, and for the severest whipping which they had to bestow Vashti had nothing save shrugs of the shoulders and mocking grins. As she did not fear the worst they could do, she had no desire for the best they could give. Some-"], [45, "A Descendant of Kings in the Poor-house. 41 body said that the child had not a particle of gratitude in her composition, but the truth was the authorities never got at anything which aroused her gratitude ; and in like manner when found in fault she was utterly impenitent. She had a certain mixture of fear, aversion, and respect for her father \u2014 a singularly ignorant, brutalised man, with moral and mental development little above that of the beasts which perish, but not without a certain rough force which Vashti could appreciate in his very stolidity and savagery. For her mother, whom she had regarded simply as her father's chattel, to be cursed and kicked, starved and beaten to the verge of murder, she had a childish fondness alter nating with a supreme contempt. The first time a workhouse nurse went through the form of putting Vashti to bed she said to the girl with a dash of pharisaical superciliousness, \u2014 \" You hain't got a prayer now, little un. We'll have to teach you one, and you'll mind and pick it up fast, and say it correck and reg'lar, or Chaplain will be down on you.\" \" I ha' got a prayer ! \" cried Vashti triumphantly. \" Mother taught it me, and I said it to her sometimes when I wanted to.\" \"You'll need to 'want to' here, I can tell you, or Chaplain will know the reason why. Well, now, your"], [46, "Vashti Savage. 42 mother could not have been a bad sort of gipsy to teach you your prayers and hear you say them,\" said the nurse, surprised out of her self-complacence ; but she was not greatly edified by the ancient doggerel which Vashti delivered at the top of her voice, swinging about her body in a highly irreverent manner. Three postes to my bed, Three angels to my head. Matthew, Wark, Luke, and John Bless the bed that I he on.\" \" Call that a prayer ? \" cried out the nurse indignantly; \"and there is the less sense in it that you hadn't got no bed, not to say posteses, nothing but a horrid bundle of straw.\" Whereupon Vashti dealt the woman a sounding slap for slandering straw. It had been more to the wild creature even than it was to the Russian Emperor Nicholas of Crimean notoriety. He clung to a sackful of \"clean fodder\" which always formed part of his luggage when he travelled, that it might fill the palliasse to be deposited in the gilded beds of palaces. But Vashti had revelled in the delights of straw pure and simple, had burrowed in it, hidden herself in it, peeped through it, tickled her own and other people's noses with it, and never exhausted its infinite resources. When everybody had tried in vain to win over and make something of Vashti Savage, the workhouse tired"], [47, "A Descendant of Kings in the Poor-house. 43 of her extraordinary pranks and unconquerable un ruliness, and she became a nuisance and burden. In lieu of the better methods, which had failed, she had to be perpetually spied upon, hunted, and persecuted. It did not cure the black sheep \u2014 more a goat than a sheep \u2014 it only rendered her a greater pariah and outcast. The officials had to come down upon her constant transgressions, as a matter of course. The old people, who were never safe from her tricks, cried out querul ously against her. The other children with youthful fickleness followed suit, and either pointed their fingers at her metaphorically, or shrank from her. At last somebody wiser and kinder than the rest bethought himself that Mr. Swift, of Water Basset, had brought the plague into the house, and had shown some interest in the imp. This functionary let Mr. Swift know that Vashti Savage was doing no good in the workhouse. If there was to be any hope of her suture, she must be removed and tried in a different quarter."], [48, "CHAPTER III. A HAWK IN A SPARROW'S NEST. ROGER SWIFT was a good deal put to it what to do with the girl. He had made further inquiries, and learned that an elderly gipsy woman had died in a waggon pitched near Wood Basset, not above six miles from Water Basset, within a week from the time when he had found Vashti. Whether this was her mother, and whether the unfortunate woman's death was the result of the injuries inflicted on her to an extent which had alarmed her daughter, he could not tell, and had no great wish to ascertain definitely. Some probability was lent to the horrible suspicion by the fact that the man, who had got her buried as his wife within as short a time as possible, had left immediately afterwards, waggon and all, and had not since shown himself in the district. The awkward item for Roger Swift was to find him self with a gipsy girl on his hands without having the"], [49, "A Hawk in a Sparrow's Nest. 45 workhouse to fall back upon as her natural destination. He might indeed have refused to withdraw her, or de clined all responsibility in the matter, just as he might have left her to her fate when she ran against him in the dark. But he was a man whose motto ought to have been, \" Live and let live.\" He was possessed of many kindly impulses rather than beneficent principles. He did not like to inflict a permanent annoyance on the workhouse, whose interests he ought to have at heart ; at the same time neither could he bring himself to cast Vashti at her age on a wicked world. He looked about him, and used his frank, cheery tongue, which was very winning and coaxing, to some purpose. But he did not, as he would have said, \" board \" Mrs. Rust again. By the way, the slipshod, slangy, not unracy English he spoke, might have been a key to his character \u2014 self-indulgent in a compara tively harmless fashion, with a strong dash of laziness, and an equally strong dash of fun, combined with the sweet blood and affectionate temper of a man friendly all round and to the core. Roger Swift descended a few more rungs in the social ladder, and hit, not on the childless wife of a well-to-do gamekeeper and lodgekeeper, whose house was a pattern beyond the attainment of all save the best and most ambitious housewives in the parish, but on Mrs. Back, the drudging wife of Jonathan Back,"], [50, "Vashti Savage. 46 labourer. She was also the weighed-down mother of six sons, ranging from a hobbledehoy of seventeen to a baby boy of six years old ; all with excellent appetites, always crying out to have the cravings of nature satisfied ; all with an immeasurable capacity for getting out the elbows of their jackets, the knees of their trousers, and the toes and heels of their stockings. Mrs. Back's hands were never done baking, boiling, mending, darning, washing, and scouring in a coarse, rough fashion, with little time left for sweeping and dusting \u2014 the fine work of cottage economy. Indeed, the Backs' old thatched cottage, with crumbling walls and rotting roof, far from weather-tight, set down in Clay Lane, was so teeming with population, so in cessantly entered and quitted by dusty or muddy feet, that there was neither space nor time for what must needs have been its perpetual purification. Mr. and Mrs. Back were not Mr. Swift's tenants, else with his passion for making people comfortable, ac cording to his ideas of comfort, and a certain personal orderliness and daintiness which somehow crossed what might have been slovenly in the man's tastes and habits, he would have had the cottage pulled down, in spite of its picturesqueness, and rebuilt on the most approved model in a twinkling. But he knew the Backs as he knew every face and history about Water Basset. He had exchanged hearty greetings with both"], [51, "A Hawk in a Sparrow s Nest. 47 husband and wife on an average twice a week for the last fifteen years, the date of his tenancy of the great house at Water Basset. He had helped the Backs liberally, both when Jonathan was laid down with rheumatic fever and when there was a difficulty about the allotment system in the parish, on which the cottagers depended as their greatest boon in hard years. Roger Swift lent the old Rector, who was nearly past work, the strong support of his voice and purse, so that the difficulty was got over, and the cottagers permitted to plant their potatoes and grow their cabbages in the full confidence which had been shaken for a time. Jonathan Back, a phlegmatic man, was grateful to Mr. Swift in a dull, gruff way, and liked him after a languid fashion. But Mrs. Back positively adored the gentleman she chose to call \"Squire Swift,\" though he was not a landowner. Men like him, big, handsome, and cordial, are for the most part popular with women, and hugely so with women of Mrs. Back's class and type, perennially poverty-stricken, faint-hearted, and depressed. It was as much to please her Squire Swift as to meet an ungratified burning wish for a girl in the room of one of her six boys, that she consented to take Vashti as a boarder under her care. Really the moderate sum received, though it was highly wel come in the Backs' constant straits, with Jonathan's having what his wife called enigmatically \" a thirsty"], [52, "Vashti Savage. 48 throat,\" was less a consideration to Mrs. Back than the thought that Squire Swift had picked her out and asked her to take the little wench, and it was the first thing in which she had got it into her power to oblige him. . Besides, she had the dim hope \u2014 all Lizzie Back's hopes had grown dim under a long experience of overwork and worry beyond her bodily and mental strength \u2014 that things would go better with her if she had a young lass, though she were but a little one, and of gipsy blood, to help her in the incessant moiling and toiling which was making an old woman of her before her time, and hurrying her to the grave. For it took exactly all the money the Backs \u2014 father and elder sons \u2014 earned in summer to discharge the debts the heads of the house were compelled to contract in winter. In course of time their brood would be dispersed and doing for themselves, but never a shilling could the parents lay by for a rainy day or the long winter of old age, and the thought that it was so hung like a stone round poor Mrs. Back's neck. Back was of a more stolid and indifferent cast of mind, and it did not disturb him much to consider that the struggle of many years was likely to end in their going into the House and being buried in paupers' graves. Yet for the Backs, who had been cousins, and had belonged to different branches of a family that had once been in a good way \u2014 yeomen farmers, owning"], [53, "A Hawk in a Sparrow's Nest. 49 their land with so many \" head \" of cattle to prove their prosperity \u2014 the House and paupers' graves formed a descent, the very contemplation of which was more -than Lizzie Back could stand. Mrs. Back was a long, thin woman, with a hollowed- out front, a bent back, and a toothless mouth, as if she had chewed her troubles as a cow chews her cud, till not the troubles, but the masticators, had failed. She had no time to attend to her toilet, and generally appeared in a much-faded cotton gown with the sleeves rolled up to her bony elbows, a much-soiled canvas apron with the corners tucked under the band out of the way, and an old battered hat of Jonathan's, or of one of the boys', stuck on the top of her disordered, grizzled hair. The ludicrous effect of this head-dress when worn on a woman's head in connection with a wrinkled forehead, lack-lustre eyes, dragged cheeks, and a toothless, generally half-open mouth, as if the jaws had opened and were too slack and weary to close again, was entirely lost on Mrs. Back. As for the head-dress itself, shockingly bad felt hats for men and boys might be reckoned as part of the ordinary costume of the women of the village, since the hat was wonder fully convenient to wear indoors and out, going about the house, sallying forth to find the pigs and the ducks, hoeing in the allotment, etc. \" Now, Vashti, I can only hope you'll behave your 4"], [54, "Vashti Savage. 50 self here,\" said Mr. Swift, as he again conducted his protegee to her destination. \"I have been told that your conduct in the workhouse was \u2014 well, far from all that could be wished, but we'll say no more about it,\" hastily dismissing the subject, as equally disagreeable to them both ; \" we'll trust that you'll turn over a new leaf when I give you another chance. Only remember that chances are not as plentiful as blackberries, and will infallibly come to an end before long.\" \" I'se like a good lapful of blackberries,\" said Vashti, smacking her lips, and speaking with what sounded like brazen-faced irrelevance ; at the same time she looked regretfully at the autumn hues of the leaves in the lane, which recalled the fact that somewhere the blackberries were changing from purple to black, and the nuts getting brown. \"But I say, master,\" she resumed glibly, \" I didn't do no harm at the work'us. The folk there went about wi' faces as long as your arm, and wanted to drive you like a flock of sheep. Men and women, boys and gals, bean't sheep, even though their livers is white wi' living in houses and stuffing theirsens at meal-times, when they bean't sitting reading print books and sewing seams,\" ended Vashti in scorn. \" Don't talk nonsense,\" said Mr. Swift, attempting to look and speak sternly, but without success; \"your business is to make yourself useful to Mrs. Back, without minding the colour of people's livers or lungs either."], [55, "A Hawk in a Sparrow s Nest. 51 We must see about more schooling for you presently, or we'll have the School Board down upon us. But it is the holidays, so there is time enough to think of that, especially as I am afraid you give little promise of being a good scholar.\" Mrs. Back was in her washed-out calico and bent felt hat as usual ; she had the distrait look and vague manner which she always exhibited when she was withdrawn from her proper business of attending to the wants of her household, to which she had devoted herself for a number of years with single-minded devotion. It was only intermitted by such unavoidable accidents as the births of her children, or when she occasionally sank down at her post, and in her weariness toppled for a space between life and death ; as people liable to fainting-fits hover on the verge of insensibility, then pull themselves together, return to full consciousness, and take up again the occupations they have perforce laid aside for a season. Mr. Swift's cheery \" Good-morning, Mrs. Back. How is Back ? How are all your sons ? all alive and kicking, eh ? I didn't doubt it ; and you yourself \u2014 why, you look younger and fresher every time I see you,\" roused her agreeably. Roger had perhaps last seen Mrs. Back on the verge of one of her illnesses ; and even if he had not, would certainly have persuaded himself of her rejuvenation in order to please her and"], [56, "Vashti Savage. 52 himself. \" Here is the girl you are going to be so good as to receive into your family, and make as handy and industrious a woman as you are yourself. She has a great deal to learn, but I hope she'll reward you by soon being of some service to you.\" He looked hard at Vashti, to induce her, if possible, to come forward and say she would do her best ; while Mrs. Back was wiping her hands on her apron, as it was always her first impulse to do, so habitually was she paring potatoes, washing vegetables, rinsing out dishes, soaping clothes, or scouring floors. But all that Vashti did was to make an audible remark which might have been dispensed with. \" Her house ain't much bigger than our tent. It ain't like the work'us.\" \"No, it ain't,\" said Mrs. Back, a little sharply, \"yet most people would prefer it to t'other ; and though it bean't much of a place, I should think it's a deal better than a rickety tent.\" \" Don't make invidious remarks, Vashti ; and, believe me, comparisons are odious.\" Roger Swift talked in the air. Then he counselled her in an undertone, seeking to keep the peace. \" There, say you'll be a good girl and do as she bids you.\" \" It's easy saying,\" said Vashti cynically. \" I'se be a good girl and do as I bids mysen \u2014 no as him \u2014 no as her bids me.\""], [57, "A Hawk in a Sparrow s Nest. 53 Vashti had left the workhouse uniform behind her ; and as she could not resume her rags, had been put into an old holland frock of Miss Priscilla Swift's, dedicated to Vashti's needs. She hunched up the bodice, lolled against the cottage door-post, and squinted frightfully at Mrs. Back. \"I hope you and me may agree,\" said the excellent woman, cautiously and doubtfully ; \" I shouldn't like to disappoint the Squire, but I've a trouble on my nerves at times. Jonathan, he will not stand no contradiction ; and the boys are like other boys, fain to be first and foremost, to have their own ways, save when their father is by, and to bide no lick or jibe 'cept it be from him.\" \" Of course Vashti will not take it upon her to interfere with your sons, or, for that matter, with any member of your family,\" said Mr. Swift hastily. \" You are to have the training of her. You have got the raw material, and no mistake. Train it to your own mind, and she will be at your disposal in return. I hope that one day you will both have cause to be thankful for having been thus brought together. A house without a girl, and a girl without a house \u2014 could anything be more pat ? You will fit in splendidly and manage famously. Good-morning, Mrs. Back ; come to me for your money. Good-morning, Vashti ; remember what I told you,\" said Roger Swift, accomplishing his"], [58, "Vashti Savage. 54 retreat, sanguine as usual that he had done all that could be done, though not without qualms as to what would be the end of it. Mrs. Back looked after him admiringly and with a wistful sigh, as if she were dismissing a vision of an infinitely brighter personality and experience than had fallen to her lot. For Jonathan Back, in addition to his grinding poverty, was a dull and heavy-hearted man \u2014 almost as heavy-hearted for a man as his wife was for a woman. If he ever brightened up, it was over a pipe and a glass of beer in the village ale-house ; and he went there a great deal too often, meanly abandoning Mrs. Back to bear her burden unrelieved by his help, or, what would have been still more effectual, the considerable portion of his wretched wages as a day-labourer, which he thus muddled away. Mr. Swift suspected this drain on the resources of the Back family, though, in his habitual inclination to think the best of everybody and condone errors generally, he slurred it over in his own mind, and made excuses for \" poor Back \" with his scanty food and lingering rheumatic pains. When the master of- the ceremonies in the introduc tion of Vashti to Mrs. Back was gone, that matron returned instantly to her household duties, which happened to be at the washing-tub that day, even before she looked at Vashti, with the woman's far-away"], [59, "A Hawk in a Sparrow s Nest. 55 look, and told her mechanically to make herself at home, since she was to live with them. In order to do so she had better take up any handy turn she thought she could best do. There was a bed to make ; there was Will's jacket to mend against he came in, for he had torn it right up the back with a fall he had in the quarry late the night before. He had been obliged to go to work in a borrowed jacket. There were the chicks to feed. There was the child to mind when he waked up from his mid-day sleep ; for Johnnie had been bad with whooping cough, and had fallen back into his baby ways. As Mrs. Back went over the various tasks ready for Vashti in a listless, sing-song manner that was not particularly inspiring, she complained to herself that the queer, cross-eyed, dark-skinned monkey of a lass leaning against the door-post \u2014 for all the world as if the house were her own and she had nothing more to do than come in, sit down, and ask for whatever she wanted \u2014 stared at her, the mistress of the house, in a way that was fit to bring her heart into her mouth. She told herself that she was willing to do anything in reason to please so strapping and pleasant-spoken a gentleman as Squire Swift, who had always a heart some word or a friendly deed to bestow on a poor borne-down woman. But she was sure and certain from that moment that she could no more make an"], [60, "56 Vashti Savage. honest, hard-working, dependable woman out of that piece of gipsy indifference and sauciness than little Johnnie could really make a pea-cod into a cow with horns, or a gooseberry into a pig with a curly tail, though he spent his small skill in trying it many a time. Vashti did not act on Mrs. Back's hint to make herself at home by taking up a handy turn and doing something for the general welfare of the family. She stood and glanced askance at the paper dropping from the damp walls ; the rusty grate Mrs. Back had not time to polish ; the pots and pans which were inevitably sentenced to a perfunctory swill ; the more or less crippled chairs ; the heterogeneous collection of coarse towels, half-dried children's clothes and men's raiment hanging over the chair-backs ; the rough table heaped with dirty dishes and spoons, bits of fat bacon, ends of dumpling, remains of soap and candles ; and the floor, littered with the refuse of the last meal, and the flying suds from Mrs. Back's tub. In the middle of Vashti's intractableness she had a capacity for receiving impressions. She must have learned something, little as anybody had suspected it, from the whitewashed spaciousness and clock-work regularity of the workhouse, against which she had kicked violently at the time ; for born and bred in the rudest tent, to which Mrs. Back's cottage was a refined"], [61, "A Hawk in a Sparrow's Nest. 57 and luxurious dwelling, the first expression that crossed her keen brown face was one of disgust at the small space, the prevailing disorder, the mess of everything around her. She picked her way in a gingerly manner, that would have infinitely exasperated anybody less stupefied and knocked down than Mrs. Back, to the best, the only arm-chair in the room, and quietly sat down in it. \" Get out o' that ! \" cried Lizzie Back, unable to witness the desecration, and stirred up to something like animation. \" That there's Back's chair. I never sit down in it unless I'm ailing. I'd like to see him find a wench like you in his chair. Not that he's not peaceable enough ; I've not that to bring against him, if he ain't provoked beyond a man's bearing.\" Then Mrs. Back realised that something more than a polite suggestion was wanted to get Vashti to make herself at home by doing a handy turn. She raised her muffled voice, and said, in her drawling way, quite distinctly, \" Vashie, if so be that's your outlandish name, you'll be pleased to go up the stairs and mind the child ; I hear him stirring.\" Whether pleased or displeased, Vashti condescended to execute the commission. Perhaps it was not alto gether her fault that, when she had climbed the top stair, little Johnnie screamed at the dark face and cross set eyes till Mrs. Back had, as she said, to go a-trapesing"], [62, "58 Vashti Savage. after the girl to pacify the child. But if there was only bad luck in the first mischance, for the second the new inmate of the Back family was clearly accountable, since she must have been given some seams to do in the workhouse ; yet her execution of the darn on Will's jacket was, according to Mrs. Back, enough to turn the stoutest stomach. Finally, when Mrs. Back gave another commission to the creature she had fondly hoped would prove a little maid as handy as a daughter to her \u2014 for as everybody knew, boys were all thumbs and heels in a house \u2014 the most lamentable failure ensued. The guidance of the ducks to and from the brook was one of the most important details of a Water Basset household. The Rector's wife was wont to assert that duck-rearing \u2014 a strong feature of the place, especially the bringing up of early ducklings for the London market \u2014 so engrossed the energies of the female popu lation, that she was unable to do anything with them in the shape of mothers' meetings, sewing classes, singing classes, etc., because always the ducks ran through the programme. Their owners were engaged, beyond the possibility of postponing the engagement, either in seeing the young ducklings out of the eggs or feeding them, or leading them to and from the brook, and \" fettling them up\" for the night. This giving the ducks a taste of their native element was supposed to be the reason"], [63, "A Hawk in a Sparrow s Nest. 59 why the Water Basset ducks, though less fat than their contemporaries, were superior in flavour to any other ducks in the market. But the process was somewhat ticklish at the best, and the committing it to Vashti Savage, the very day she came, was an evidence of that \" woolliness of the head,\" of which Mrs. Back and her friends were wont to complain, as one of the trying effects of her incessant labours and weakened constitu- tion. Vashti, instead of driving the ducks before her to the brook at the shallowest spot, which Mrs. Back had plainly mentioned, between the sluice of Dunn's Mill on the one hand and the low bridge, which was railed in beneath for the further protection of the ducks, on the other, permitting them to have a dip and a swim, and then leading them out and bringing them safely home again, let the birds loose in the main body of the brook. She did not even look where they were, but played herself as Baby Johnnie might have done \u2014 \"a twelve years' wench like she ! \" \u2014 wading and chasing minnows and dragon-flies. She was so long in return- ing that Mrs. Back, dreading that something was amiss, left her tub as it stood and wandered down to the brook. There, though she cried, and shrieked, and ran like a mad woman as well as she was able, for the space of an hour, she could not reclaim more than seven of her beautiful ducks out of a fine brood of ten. She had to be content with the seven, while she saw the remaining"], [64, "60 Vashti Savage. three, that had been feeding on barley and potatoes for weeks, a-sailing away in triumph to the salt sea for ought that she knew. And the worst of it was, that \" the unchancy, untamed lass, who had occasioned the loss, no more minded it and the disgrace she was in than she minded the Queen and the Parliament in Lon'on.\" When Jonathan Back and his sons came in at six o'clock from the fields and the play which had succeeded school, Mrs. Back naturally unbosomed herself, and confided to them her grievances in the presence of the offender. It was not that Mrs. Back was a hard and vindictive woman ; it was simply that a vent for her vexation was absolutely necessary to her. Back was, as has been said, a clod-hopper, if there ever was one, with his wits further soddened by beer, when he could get it. The big, lumbering lads, descending in a sliding scale to school-boys and the six-year-old child, were rough colts, tearing and stamping about, crowing over their mother, indulging in boisterous horseplay towards each other, with which their parents rarely interfered. Father and sons, together with Mrs. Back, were full of pride and prejudice \u2014 the dogged pride and the blind prejudice of many English working people \u2014 against all who differ from them in race and colour, above all against gipsies and workhouse brats. Its expression was a new experience for Vashti, who had her own"], [65, "\u2713 A Hawk in a Sparrow 's Aresl. 61 fantastic pride as a descendant of kings of the East, who had hitherto dwelt either among entire or com parative equals in her father's tent, or in the workhouse among fellow-paupers. With her quick consciousness, which was like the unerring instinct of an animal, she was sensible that she was looked down upon and despised, whether it was by Mr. Back, who stated openly \"it was his humble opinion she was of a kind that nowt save a hiding would keep in order ; \" or by the louts, who addressed her, unrebuked by their parents, as \" Workus gal,\" \"Guy,\" \"Jumbo,\" put out their feet to trip her, and pushed and pulled her whenever she came near them ; or by Mrs. Back, who doled out the tale of Vashti's delinquencies in one long trickling flow of com plaint and protest. Vashti sat, as Mrs. Back declared, like \" a haythen image with a face of brass through it all.\" But the earliest riser the following morning found the house-door open, and it was speedily discovered that the boarder had employed a common weapon with her people, and had bolted clean awray. Mrs. Back was divided between a sense of relief, grief at failing Squire Swift in the person of the vagabond he had chosen to take up, and anxiety lest anything should be found missing from the household treasury, little as there was even for a gipsy to lift \u2014 the rolling-pin, for instance; or the hammer, which had just"], [66, "62 Vashti Savage. got a new handle ; or the warming-pan, which was kept as an ornament and not as an article for use. How ever, a little investigation settled the point that at this time Vashti had gone empty-handed, neither was she long of being found. She was discovered before the day was done asleep among some hayricks, when the mowers went to turn the hay over on a farm a few miles off. She had lost some of her power of endur ance in walking and fasting since her stay in the work house. It was possible also that the loneliness of her circumstances pressed on her. Reinstalled in her position at the Backs, there followed a series of depredations and disasters in con nection with the girl which, in the judgment of the mother of the family, were more than any mortal woman could set her face to, for a continuance, even though Squire Swift were to rise to be an angel and the money he paid were to be ten times more than it was. Every thing Vashti touched she broke or spilled or spoilt. She looked you in the eyes, as far as her cross-set eyes would meet yours, and lied about her misdemean ours till she was black in the face, or ought to have been. She swore like a trooper \u2014 an accomplishment which she had picked up chiefly from the reprobates of the workhouse, instead of any good words from the chaplain, and substituted for stray samples of the Romany language, of which, not being a pure gipsy on"], [67, "A Hawk in a Sparrow's Nest. 63 the mother's side, she had never possessed much. It might not have signified though she had transferred such gibberish to those younger members of the Back household who were quick of ear and glib of tongue, but it did matter that she should teach them the use of profane language, enough to bring the house down about the family's ears. Mrs. Back had one particular article of value besides her rolling-pin, hammer, etc. It was a relic of her maiden days \u2014 a single gilt earring, containing a red glass stone. Perhaps she meant to hand it down as an heirloom in the family, but it vanished from the pill box which was carefully lodged at the bottom of a band-box containing Back's Sunday hat \u2014 Mrs. Back had long ceased to have a Sunday bonnet \u2014 a snip of her wedding gown, and an odd baby's boot that had belonged to a baby boy Back who had passed out of the crowded ranks of his surviving brethren. No thing was safe from Vashti's roaming, prying eyes, and from the thieving fingers, so slow at honest work, so clever and ready for mischief. Mrs. Back never ceased to lament her loss, and spoke of it to the end of her life. \" Whatever could have made so great and wise a man as Squire Swift back such a worthless hussy of a gipsy ? \" she asked herself. \" Was he be witched, or what was it ? \" But the crown was put on Vashti's enormities when,"], [68, "64 Vashti Savage. in spite of the open scolding and scoffing of the Back lads at the incongruous inmate, one of them \u2014 the noisy Will, whose torn jacket she had made a spectacle of \u2014 as he was innocently engaged constructing snares to catch larks, was dared, jeered at, and enticed by the wicked creature to make gins for hares, which he set, \"unbeknown\" to his father and mother, in the planta tion that was part of the preserves Squire Swift leased for his shooting. It might be a just retribution on Squire Swift, but it was a terrible affront to the Backs, who had never been \" had up \" for poaching before. For Will was taken red-handed in his clumsy efforts to manage his gins. He was carried before the justices, where his father and mother likewise appeared, Back losing a day's wages, which meant a couple of meals to the family, and Mrs. Back, who had never a minute to spare, leaving her accumulated domestic work at a standstill for a good many hours, and that signified to her an incalculable increase of groaning toil, dire dis comfort, and deep discouragement akin to despair. But the Backs could not leave Will in the lurch, and they were determined with righteous vindictiveness to lug Vashti in their train, and expose her as the real author of their misfortune. Happily the justices were appeasable. Squire Swift was on the bench. The culprit was very young, and had borne a good character previously ; and Vashti,"], [69, "A Hawk in a Sparrow's Nest. 65 hardened liar as she was, did not deny that she had put the gins into Will's head \u2014 in fact, she was rather proud of her share of the performance. \" As if his thick, stiff fingers could ha' twisted the wires withouten my help, or as if he had wit to know where the hares would come in the bonny moonlight,\" she said to the justices' faces, with a saucy assurance which served to rob her confession of any magnanimity that might otherwise have been attributed to it. Will and his father and mother were dismissed with a sharp rebuke, and a serious recommendation to them to look better after the lad, and also the girl, for whom it seemed they were responsible. But Mrs. Back felt small gratitude for Will's exemption from a heavier penalty. Where was her day's work ? Where was Back's day's wage ? What would ever give her faith that the young gipsy in the house would not further lead off Will, till he, too, became a vagrant, thief, murderer, and ended by being either shipped beyond the seas or hung on the gallows-tree ? Nay, the trouble on poor Mrs. Back's nerves took hold of her to such an extent, that she was filled with the fancy that Vashti had a deep design of abducting the six-year-old Johnnie, changing his clothes, painting his face, and begging the country by the help of his irresistible attractions and allurements. At last Back himself was forced to call on Squire Swift 5"], [70, "Vashti Savage. 66 and deliver an ultimatum. Back said the Squire must remove \" that there gipsy wench right off from the Backs' premises, or that Back would not answer for his missus's wits, as were going a-woolgathering a deal wusser than usual, and the Squire would have to look out a place for her in the county 'sylum.\""], [71, "CHAPTER IV. \" LET US TRY WHAT WE CAN MAKE OF HER, PRISSY', BEN.\" ROGER SWIFT was sitting in his handsome morning-room at breakfast with his daughter Prissy and his son Ben. It was the same Prissy to whom he had likened Vashti in age, which turned out to be a mistake, for he was rarely exact in his reckon ing. Vashti was a stunted child-woman of twelve years ; Prissy, looking older than she was, not because she happened to be well grown, but from the opposite reason, that she was dwarfish and humpbacked, was not much more than ten. Ben was nearer Vashti in age ; he was in his twelfth year, bigger by the head and shoulders than Vashti, who, however, though under sized, was not deformed like Prissy. Ben's height and muscular strength had nothing of the loutish heaviness which characterised the bodily bulk of the young Backs. The well-knit, well-trained physique of the English public school-boy was what distinguished Ben. He"], [72, "Vashti Savage. 68 was also handsome, like his father, in a fair, florid style, with rather more breadth of forehead and of jaw. Mr. Swift had many more children than Ben and Prissy, but they were more or less grown up and out in the world. Those of them not actually settled \u2014 like Tom in the Civil Service in India, Ned as a colonist in Australia, Mary as the wife of a London lawyer, Alexa as married to a vicar in Wales \u2014 somehow seemed to prefer to take home in flying visits rather than to reside there. It was the case with the lads whose careers did not necessarily establish them elsewhere. Charlie might as well have bought the goodwill of the old doctor's business at Water Basset, and begun to practise in the neighbourhood, as have bought another old business and begun to practise in another country neighbourhood. Arthur, the land agent, could have secured, through his father, the agency of Sir Herbert Basset's estates; indeed, Roger Swift had got it promised to his son, if the said son had not chosen to accept a different agency, in no way superior, in one of the northern counties. It was the same with the unmarried daughters who were grown up. They could not find enough to do at Water Basset. The world is so full of new paths for young women in this generation, that it is perhaps hard on those who are of an enterprising and adventurous disposition to expect them to stay at home, with no particular engagements for which the"], [73, "\"Let us try what we can make of her.\" 69 girls have a special turn. Roger Swift was the last man to force any man or woman's inclinations. He made his daughters as well as his sons handsome allowances, and let them go where and do what they would within reasonable bounds, which they never desired to overstep ; for he was right in being well assured, both as to their principles and their judgment. Thus Clara Swift was studying as an artist, and Annie was already preparing to be a nurse ; but quite beyond the artistic or the medical learning, neither of which was more than amateurish dabbling, the young women had a strong inclination for change and variety, and for the best opportunities of settling in life. Instead of burying themselves at Water Basset, which was rather a retired country place, they lived with their married sisters and unmarried brothers by turns, or paid visits to old school-fellows, till there were only the scrapings and parings of their years remaining for the great house at Water Basset. It had been taken for the accommoda- tion of a large family when they were young, and for the most part stationary. It was now comparatively empty, though by no means forlorn ; and Roger Swift was content enough to dwell in it with his old servants, with little Prissy, who had a nurse that had been with her since she was a baby, and a highly satisfactory day governess to look after her, and with Ben when he was home for his holidays."], [74, "Vashti Savage. 70 This loose holding together and general flying apart of the various young Swifts certainly did not proceed from any lack of kindness on their father's part, or any remarkable want of affection on the children's side. The death of the mother, like the removal of the foundation stone of a building, or the withdrawal of the string which threads a row of beads, might have had something to do with the circumstance. But its chief cause was the impatience of even slight restraint, and the hankering after novelty and excitement, conspicuous features in nineteenth century humanity. The result was very much the same as if the desultory constitution of the family had proceeded from other reasons. The sons and daughters alike gained in self-reliance and independence, but they lost in family sympathy and close attachment.' Only Prissy was always at home, because no other place was so good for her, and she hated to be amongst strangers. Ben was merely home for the holidays, and after accidents. He had an unfortunate faculty for accidents. He had broken a leg once and an arm twice, and lately he had been struck on the side of the head by a cricket ball, so hard a blow that the doctor, called in to see him, said it was the greatest wonder his skull Was not cracked, and ordered, as a precaution against bad consequences, that his patient should go to grass \u2014 that is, be sent home \u2014 and not look at a book, except by way of amusement, for an entire term. Ben,"], [75, "\" Let us try what zee can make of her.\" 71 though he was not without boyish ability and ambition, had no objection ; and Prissy, Avho loved Ben next to her father, while she was sometimes very trying to both of them, had still less objection. Seeing that it was so, Roger Swift said in his blithe tones, which, even now that he was approaching his threescore, had something boyish in them, \" It was an ill Avind that blew ne'er a body good.\" The father, son, and daughter Avere at breakfast together just after Jonathan Back had demonstrated the inadvisability of Vashti Savage's continuing under Mrs. Back's care. Mr. Swift was puzzled, and at the same time tickled, by a difficulty which would simply either have bored or put out most men. He poured out his perplexity and sense of diversion to his children, from a habit he still had of desiring to impart con fidences, and to haA-e somebody to laugh at and with him, which was a compliment that none of his elder sons and daughters had prized, whatever Ben and Prissy might do in the future. \"Was there ever such a punishment inflicted on an un lucky man for strolling and smoking till past ten o'clock, and picking up a modern Atalanta who had stumbled on him in the darkness ? If she had been a gipsy boy, or even a gipsy Avoman, the answer would have lain in a nutshell. He or she might very well have been trusted to look after number one. But a poor little"], [76, "Vashti Savage. 72 creature of twelve, though she has spirit enough for ten girls, I cannot let her loose on the world friendless and unprotected. Her brute of a father has gone nobody knows where, even if he could be trusted not to beat her, as she swears he beat her mother, who is either dead or taken out of the way. Mrs. Rust turned up her nose at the intruder on her domain for a couple of nights. The workhouse will proceed to extremities with her \u2014 a method of managing her of which I cannot say I approve \u2014 if I send her there again. She has made the Backs' house too hot to hold her any longer. I am not aware of any Home which is exactly suitable for her ; besides, I do not know that I could get her into such an establishment, to be kept there for a period of years, without paying down a sum of money, Avhich I am not inclined to fork out for a will-o'-the-wisp likely to slip through the matron's fingers before she can tell what she is about. Upon my word, I see but one resource. Let us try what we can make of her, Prissy, Ben.\" As Mr. Swift spoke his handsome, middle-aged face lit up with such a gleam of eager, happy expectation, as always came to it Avhen there was a promise of anything out of the way, odd, and entertaining, especially in connection with a generous action, how ever rash or foolish. He could not be said to \u2014 \" Do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame ; \" but he was certainly fonder of giving pleasure and of con-"], [77, "\" Let us try what we can make of her.\" 73 ferring favours than of the widespread popularity which was one reward of his agreeable qualities. \" All right, father,\" said Ben, warming to the thought of a gipsy girl, and the information she might give him Avith regard to a gipsy camp \u2014 a phase of life which still held an irresistible fascination for a youngster who had had the Robinson Crusoe fever of boyhood badly, and was not in his twelfth year altogether emancipated from its clutches. But Ben's face, though it lit up with satisfaction, was rather less gleeful than his father's. In some respects Roger Swift was not only a boy to the last ; he was more of a boy than any of his boys had ever been. He out-heroded Herod. Prissy's face, pinched, white, and prematurely old, did not light up at all, though she was in her heart stirred by the idea of so queer an inmate of the quiet house, which had been quiet e\\'er since her mother's death, soon after Prissy's birth \u2014 partly because Roger Swift had mourned his wife sincerely, and cared little afterwards for the society which she had adorned, and partly because, by the time his spirits had recovered their tone and buoyancy, a certain constitutional indo lence, which belonged to his tolerant, self-indulgent nature, prevented his taking the trouble to resume habits he had dropped. As for Prissy, she could not, child or girl, go out into the world as her sisters had gone. She shrank from contact Avith those of her fellow-"], [78, "Vashti Savage. 74 creatures with whom she had not been always familiar. Yet she felt the unbroken routine and continued quiet of the house, even when Ben was in it, as she felt by anticipation, in the precocity of juvenile sickliness and infirmity, all the deprivations which life held for her. Prissy had inherited a finer, more sensitive organism than her father's, though, unfortunately for her, she had missed the sunshiny sweetness of temper which had made the man so lovable among his kind. Her disposition was like her face, which would have been delicately pretty had it not been for the stamp of pain and pining on it. In the same manner Prissy would have been generous \u2014 not with the generosity of mere impulse, but of true magnanimity and deliberate self sacrifice; she would have been gentle, not because she was insouciante and debonnaire (we have not English Avords that precisely express the temper), but because she could forbear and hope and trust. The misfortune was that Prissy was not able to stand upright under the heavy cross which had been laid on her child's shoulders. Her father had done a good deal \u2014 still more unconsciously than consciously \u2014 to teach her to bear it ; but he had not done everything, and it threatened to dis tort the moral as Avell as the physical part of her. She was wayward and uncertain in her moods ; she refused to gratify her friends by sharing with them such plea- sures as were within her reach ; she rebelled secretly"], [79, "\"Let us try what we can make of her.\" 75 against what had been decreed by the wisdom and justice of the Highest ; she was full of unavailing longings and cravings for what was to her the unattainable. It was Prissy's cue in these days to make querulous objections to any suggestions which her companions hailed. \" I do not see how we are to try, or what we are to make of the dreadful girl, father. If Mrs. Rust and Mrs. Back will not have her, I am sure neither nurse nor cook will \" (mentioning the two chief domestics in their different departments). \" Fanny and Bella, the other maids, go for nothing, though I daresay they would scream if they met a gipsy girl on the stairs in the dark. They are so silly. I don't suppose that Charles \" (naming the butler and footman in one) \" or Wilson and Spiers \" (the coachman and gardener) \"would claim a voice in the question.\" Prissy used the language and had the manner of an old AVoman. She spoke languidly, too, as if what might be for the salvation or destruction of an immortal creature was hardly worth consideration. \"There is a radical difference between the rights of nurse and cook and those of Mesdames Rust and Back,\" said Mr. Swift, with the infinite patience which he always exercised towards his young daughter whom God had afflicted. \" Every man's house is his castle in this happy England, you know, Prissy ; so Rust's house and Back's house are their castles \u2014 more par-"], [80, "76 Vashti Savage. ticularly their Avives' castles \u2014 into which, though Rust is my gamekeeper, and I have done what I could to put an odd job into Back's hands, I cannot without rank tyranny intrude an inmate Avhom they do not choose to receive. Now this house happens to be mine, and nurse and cook \u2014 save their feelings ! \u2014 cannot forbid me to bring whom I will under its roof. They may prefer to go themselves rather than be contaminated by letting their garments come into contact with those of a poor, harmless Avretch ; but that is quite another thing. By-the-way, one obstacle to a royally descended Vashti's introduction to a respectable middle-class family has been happily removed. She would be thoroughly cleansed during her stay at the workhouse, and she cannot have incurred much fresh dirt. She must also have learnt to sit on a seat and lie on a bed \u2014 feats which Avere considerable stumbling-blocks to her at first, I remember. As to her spiritual destitu tion and degradation, I must warn you that she lies and steals, says wicked words, and tries to run away at all hours. But if you are not frightened for her, I am not frightened for you. The odds are so greatly against her. There are so many of us on the side of honour and honesty and Christian reverence, that I confess I am at a loss to think of what worth our morality and religion can be, when it dare not face the least encounter with the enemy but must flee before"], [81, "\" Let us try what we can make of her.\" 77 the solitary foe ; and such a foe \u2014 poor, little, uncon scious, jolly beggar ! I say, Prissy, I have given you dogs, cats, and birds, under the impression that they might be acceptable as gifts. What do you say to the present of an English sa\\-age by way of A'ariety \u2014 a savage whom you may tame and civilise ? \" Prissy said nothing. She did not eA-en continue the objections she had raised. She Avinced involuntarily as something in her father's light words jarred upon her. He noticed the slight recoil, and added more gravely, \" But if you really do not like her being here, Prissy, we'll give up the notion. We'll find some other way of disposing of her. You are not to be annoyed.\" \" I don't mind,\" said Prissy, with the ungracious ness which was growing upon her. \" She need haA-e nothing to do with me, though she is near me in age.\" She rose and walked away, erect so far as it rested with herself, and with a kind of old-fashioned pom posity about her ; and, in the sunshine, always attended by that crooked shadow, which her father Avould have given a great deal to have kept from being cast on the wall, Avhere she could see it more plainly than she could catch the reflection of her figure in a mirror. The shadow caused her to hate the sunshine, Avhich brought it out in strong relief. How it came that Mr. Swift talked over his servants to submit to such an invasion of their decorous, com-"], [82, "78 Vashti Savage. sortable territories is not within the province of the narrator to explain, further than that Roger Swift had a winning tongue which Avould have Aviled a bird from a tree, and a strong will of a peculiar sort \u2014 the iron gauntlet under the silken glove. Spiers the gardener discovered \u2014 opportunely, his fellow-servants alleged, with a barefaced attempt at propitiating his master, after the said Spiers had sold all the best seedling pansies and hollyhocks, having been permitted to pocket such profits \u2014 that he wanted a young girl or an old Avoman to weed the walks and gather the fallen leaves. At first it Avas thought that Vashti might lodge with the old mother of Spiers, Avho kept the house of the elderly bachelor gardener ; but Mr. Swift's cook, a solid, sedate woman, slow to move, but, when once moved, never doing things by halves, announced that it did not go \" along of her conscience \" to turn over the monkey on Granny Spiers, who was as deaf as a post, and parcel-blind. If the girl Avere to set the place on fire, she was more likely to do it under poor Granny's nose than in the great house watched by the servants. Besides, master wished to make \" summat \" of the gipsy lass, Avhich cook held to be an impossibility ; but it was not helping him a bit, in her fancy \u2014 and he was a good, pleasant-spoken master, as it Avas a treat to serA-e compared to many masters, granting him to be \" notionable,\" and carried aAvay by"], [83, "\" Let us try what we can make of her.\" 79 Avhimsies now and then \u2014 to send Vashti Savage out of the house. There was a closet next to cook's bedroom into Avhich a small bed could be put, and she undertook that the \" gal \" should sleep there, and neither come to grief herself nor bring others to grief. As for where the stranger should take her food, Fanny and Bella \u2014 the house and table maids \u2014 were a fine pair to refuse to eat at the same table Avith Vashti, who had been introduced to kniA-es and forks and spoons in the Avorkhouse, and might be further instructed not to make a mess with her victuals. She was neither a slobbering idiot nor catwitted, like two of Bella's cousins \u2014 not that they could help that \u2014 though she was a wild creature ; and for Fanny, she had better remember that her own sister-in-law, the wife of her ne'er-do-well brother, who had deserted his family and left the country, had only been too glad to take refuge in the workhouse with her children. Fanny was a pretty one to cast scorn on a Avorkhouse girl or a gipsy either. Roger Swift Avas so interested in his experiment that he had an interview with Vashti immediately on her arrival, and he had it on purpose in his study, Avhich was the last of a suite of rooms, two of them unusually fine for an ordinary country house. The fact was it had been a Jacobean house of good stand ing, and much consideration had been given to the spaciousness, fine proportions, and architectural decora-"], [84, "80 Vashti Savage. tions of the public rooms. The present owner was proud of his ceilings, cornices, panels, and chimney pieces, and had tried to do them justice by matching them with more rich and costly furniture than he might otherwise have indulged in. He had also an art bent, and had collected some good modern pictures \u2014 a Millais, a Poynter, a Rosa Bonheur, a Linnell, etc. \u2014 together with one or two reputed old masters, which Avere at least very fair copies of renoAvned originals. He was curious to see the impression Avhich his Turkey carpets, inlaid cabinets, and pictures AA-ould produce on any being so naive and original as Vashti Savage. To Roger Swift's disappointment she expressed neither surprise nor admiration. He did not think she was as much struck with the house and its embarras de richesses as she had been with the white, empty barren ness of the Avorkhouse. Perhaps the circumstance of her having first made the acquaintance of that splendidly primitive and utilitarian establishment had dulled her perceptions for any other kind of grandeur. At last Vashti made a dart towards a picture, and stood with her hands behind her staring at it. The design was that of a couple of gipsy fortune-tellers, in red cloaks and gay neckerchiefs, befooling a village lad, whose hand they Avere studying. Vashti threw back her head, and laughed loudly \u2014 Mr. Swift was not sure whether Avith pleasure or in ridicule."], [85, "\"Let us try what we can make of her.\" 81 \" Do you like that, Vashti ? \" he asked. \" Do you find old acquaintances there ? \" \" No ! \" She gave a flat denial. \" Them bean't true gipsies ; them be the mock gipsies I ha' seen oncet on the sands at Margate, when father took us down a hopping into Kent.

Would you like to see me do it, master ? \" cried Vashti, a bright idea striking her. \" I'se do yours for noAVt at all, 'cept,\" with a cunning glance up into his face, to see how he took the sugges tion, \"there bean't no luck without the hand's been crossed wi' silver.\" \" No, thanks, Vashti,\" said Roger Swift, shrugging his shoulders. \" It rather shakes my opinion of your skill, if you will forgive me for saying so, to find that you do not seem to know that my fortune has been told for tAvice as many years as you have lived in this world.\" C"], [86, "82 Vashti Savage. \" No, no, my fine gentleman,\" said Vashti, altering her whole manner in an instant, and using the cajoling tone Avith eminent effect. \" The fortunes of a fine, hand some gentleman like you ain't never told \u2014 not when your hair is Avhite, and yours bean't no more than turned.\" \" Hold your tongue this moment, you impudent monkey !

He remembered a great man's saying \u2014 that to possess luxuries and comforts is wealth, but to do with out them is power. Yet he found difficulty in realising"], [87, "\"Let us try what we can make of her.\" 83 that the valued product of his riches was nothing to the friendless creature beside him. \"You have not told me Avhat you think of my house, Vashti. You do not approve of my gipsy picture, though it is a Philipps ; but how does the whole thing strike you, eh ? \" Vashti hitched her thin shoulders, the blade-bones of which stuck out under Prissy's old holland jacket. \"It ain't much good, I take it,\" she answered coolly. \" All them boxes,\" pointing carelessly to the grand piano in the next room, the door of which stood open, and the ottomans and cabinets, \"mun be in your way horrid, 'cept you keeps them to hold things in.

She made some amends for her idleness by initiating Spiers, who Avas not above taking a lesson which might serve him on an occasion, in unique and successful modes of dealing with moles, and of entangling blackbirds and thrushes in the nets which Avere spread between them and the fruit, so that the birds could not free themselves."], [89, "Taming the Untamable. 85 Vashti took a greater interest in Ben than in Prissy, and would stealthily watch him through a trellis-work, Avhich separated the cricket field and tennis courts from the kitchen garden, as he made shift to keep up his spirits, playing alone. \" Come out of hiding, Vashti,\" he called to her on the second of the days that she had kept her watch. \" Have a look at my play, if you care to. It ain't much good without at least one other fellow, and father Avill seldom stand up Avith me ; he says he is too heavy and stiff, but I think he is only too lazy.

Vashti could not play cricket or tennis or football ; but when Ben's balls Avere lost, and she rushed forth to seek them, encountering him on the same errand, it was plain to be seen that she would beat him in a race. Ben was piqued, and the matter Aveighed upon his mind, so that it slipped out to his father and Prissy, causing Mr. Swift to throw down a challenge to the two, Avith Prissy and himself to serve as umpires. Sure enough, Vashti came in first by tAvice her own length at the Avinning-post.

There was an old pigeon-house at the top of one of the gables of some disused and half-ruinous offices, which Ben was forbidden to go near. But no such embargo lay on Vashti. Indeed, Roger Swift had a shrewd instinct that the fewer embargoes laid upon her the better, if he wished to present his dignity and her self-respect. To Ben's unbounded admiration Vashti managed to scale without a ladder the ivied wall to this pigeon house, and to bring down an unexpected supply of young pigeons for cook's larder. It somewhat damped the ardour of Ben's appreciation of this feat when he saw that Vashti's first act, even before she descended, had been to wring the necks of the birds coolly and cleverly. But it restored the balance of his regard Avhen he discovered that she had grazed her hand and arm badly on the broken stones, but made light of it, Avould not allow him to bind it up with his pocket-handkerchief, and scouted the mention of sticking-plaster or postage stamps. Ben and Vashti fraternised over the pigeons ; and Ben's father, so far from setting his face against"], [91, "Taming the Untamable. 87 the association, thought it was well the boy should find a playfellow close at hand, and privately instructed Spiers not to demand the \" tale of bricks\" from Vashti, at least during this term, but to let her off Avhenever Master Ben Avanted her. Vashti's intellectual faculties seemed concentrated into a de\\-ouring curiosity with regard to everything Avith which she had not and could not be expected to haA-e the slightest connection. The thirst for general information might have descended to her as part of the stock-in-trade Avhich gipsies are accustomed to cherish. She plied Ben with endless questions about his home and his school life, Avhich, having a full share of his father's good-nature, he usually answered as well as he could without unceremoniously bidding her \"shut up,\" or indulging in the schoolboy romancing and greening, to Avhich she had a violent objection. She took him aback one day by inquiring quietly, very much as a matter of course, \" Did your father wallop your mother ? \" \"No, indeed!\" he said indignantly, after he had recovered his breath. \" What could put such a thing into your head ? Of course, my father was good to my mother.

Do you suppose,\" he went on, losing his head, and with it the courtesy that was natural to him as to his father, \" that because a pair of gipsies quarrel and fight in their tent, gentlemen and ladies behave in the same brutal manner ? \" \" Bean't they flesh and blood, like we ? \" argued Vashti; \"and women can be mortal perwoking ; and their men has the right to call them to order. Them belongs to their masters.

Prissy was longer in having anything to do with the rough, strange resident in the household, though she Avatched her often from a little distance, as Vashti had Avatched Ben. The gipsy girl's extraordinary hardi ness, litheness, and vigour were at once a marvel and a trial to the rich girl deprived of what makes the animal part of man's life best worth living. Child as Prissy was, she had a premature consciousness that * Probably Vashti meant Bashan."], [94, "Vashti Savage. 90 she was set apart from other women, and that the most precious things in their lot could never be hers. She Avas like Charles Kingsley's deformed princess, without even the doors of the church ready to open and close upon her, shutting out the world which would only jeer at her, or at the best pity her. There was no black veil Avith which Prissy could hide her odious hump, and the little pink-and-Avhite face, Avhich men might have praised and adored but for that terrible seal of unnatural age, Avhich suffering and mortification had already set upon it. They say little babies Avhich are destined to die in infancy have sometimes a curiously old look that doctors dread to see on their tiny, soft faces. In like manner, though there was not a Avrinkle or a croAvfoot on her smooth, white brow, or about her clear blue eyes, and her bright broAvn hair would not have a sprinkling of grey for the next twenty or thirty years, people ahvays said what an old fashioned little thing Prissy Swift was, because there was an exact reflection of a look her grandmother had worn (her mother had not lived long enough to catch it) on Prissy's ten-year-old face. She had been forced forward \u2014 not so much intellectually as morally \u2014 in a sedentary life of frequent weakness and pain, spent among groAvn-up and elderly people, unless when her youngest brother Ben was at home. Even Ben could only be sorry for her and Avith her; he had not the"], [95, "Taming the Untamable. 91 ghost of a notion how to render her contented Avith her lot. By little and little Prissy and Vashti got acquainted, and occasionally entered into con\\'ersation when Prissy was driving with her nurse in her pony-carriage down the avenue, and requested it to be stopped, that she might watch how the first heaps of autumn leaves, which Vashti Avas collecting under the superintendence of Spiers for a huge bed of leaf-mould, were growing and groAving ; or Avhen the delicate child was able to Avalk round the sheltered gardens, and came upon the young weeder at her sIoav process of weeding ; or Avhen Ben had borroAved Vashti to keep his wicket for him, when he attempted to play as the representative of a Avhole army of cricketers. One day, when only Prissy and her nurse were by, Vashti dropped one of those pearls of conversation with which she had already electrified Ben, and created, if anything, a still greater sensation. The girl sud denly looked up from the box border she was supposed to be clearing on her hands and knees, and stared at Prissy, standing wearily in the walk, fain to shift her balance from one foot to another to relieve her weari ness, wondering how Vashti could stoop so Ioav and so long without getting giddy, and haA'ing to clutch at the ground for support. \"What an ugly crook that there is in your back,"], [96, "Vashti Savage. 92 miss,\" said Vashti, with all the composure in the world. \" Why, it is a bump as big as my two fists. I believe it ha' growd even since I corned here. Your fine frilled jacket don't hide it a bit. Bean't it a heavy Aveight for a silly thing like you to carry ? \" There was a second's dead pause. Nobody, not even Prissy's nearest and dearest, had ever spoken of her deformity to her from her babyhood till now, though everybody was aware she knew it as Avell as they did, and felt it with a personal sense of weakness and humiliation in every breath she drew. For years she had obstinately refused, without giving any reason for the refusal, to wear anything save a loose jacket instead of a bodice to her frock. She vehemently declined to visit her brothers or her married sisters. She hated to be taken away for a change to the sea side or the moors. She fretfully refused, Avith very few exceptions, to appear before visitors, and then resented not being brought down to see them. She shrank from children, especially strange children about her own age. Therefore it had been necessary for her to be for some time accustomed to the small heAver of wood and drawer of water, who had come on the scene, before she could think of speaking to her. Prissy had carried her point till she seldom stirred beyond the grounds, save to go to church with her father, and then he humoured her by driving up early"], [97, "Taming the Untamable. 93 and ushering her into one of the old-fashioned high pews, Avhere she could sit, stand, and kneel unseen, and wait till the congregation dispersed before she made her exit. No mentally afflicted man or woman was ever more horribly morbid on the subject of an infirmity than was poor little Prissy SAvift, and Avhat the morbidness was to develop into her father feared to think. The silence was broken by the nurse, furious for her nursling, Avhose delicate face became first red as a rose and then white as a lily. \" Hold your tongue, you horrid, wicked child ! \" cried Mrs. Apsley. \"You are a fit person to make remarks, Avith your black face, and your claAvs of hands, and your eyes turned the wrong way, even if your mind wasn't as crooked as, as \u2014 never heed her, Miss Prissy ; she's only jealous of your white skin, and your soft hair, and your pretty frock ; so she flies out at you, and tells lies about you. I'll speak to master, that I will, and he'll soon make you tell a different tale.\" \" No he won't,\" said Vashti, with her usual defiance, \" for there bean't no other tale to tell. I weren't telling her no lies ; it is you as is stuffing her with crammers, Avhile I were speaking gospel truth. I could say nowt else, though master were to take a stick to my back.\""], [98, "Vashti Savage. 94 \" He won't touch you,\" said Prissy, speaking at last Avith her half childish, half old-fashioned dignity and precision. \" He would not do it in any case, and he won't send you away Avhen I ask him not to do it \u2014 be quiet, Apsley, this is my own business \u2014 because you have only said what is true, and what I can see for myself.\" She turned and walked away with her low stature, her unnaturally broad chest, her head set between the shoulders which the hump had thrust up. She felt as if all the strength had gone out of her with the effort of speaking these words; yet somehow she had not been so happy for many a day. It was as if a load had been lifted from her mind. She was so glad that she had not taunted Vashti back again with her weasel-like brownness and leanness and her squinting eyes, as poor nurse had been driven to do. Prissy had a dim consciousness that, dwarf and hunch back as she was, she had got the victory, that victory which will at last subdue the Avorld and endure throughout eternity \u2014 the overcoming of evil with good. Nurse kept her word. She told Mr. Swift how badly the ill-conditioned gipsy brat had treated poor, dear, little Miss Prissy. His sanguine complexion deepened to brick-red, and an angry flash came from the eyes that laughed so often. \"Come, this is going too far,\" he said; \"this must be"], [99, "Taming the Untamable. 95 put a stop to. I Avon't haA'e Prissy vexed for all the gipsies in and out of Christendom.\" He caught up his straAv hat and strode out of one of the French windows, nurse following him at a respect ful distance. But when they came to the corner of the kitchen garden, in which Vashti had been employed, they found their visit anticipated. Prissy was there Avith Ben. She Avas holding his hand and listening with interest, putting in a Avord now and then, to his chatter with Vashti on the absorbing topics of gipsy bivouacs without tents, the kindling and maintaining of fires in unpropitious weather, the roasting of hedge hogs, etc., etc. On Vashti's head, in general innocent of any protection from the sun beyond the tattered hat, through Avhich locks of her hair Avere apt to hang, was a snow-white sun-bonnet which Prissy had worn yesterday. Vashti had not thrown it off as a needless encumbrance ; she was submitting to have her sun burnt face and eyes \u2014 like the eagle's, inasmuch as they too could gaze without blinking at the orb of day \u2014 shaded by it. It might have been the unusual shadoAV cast by the bonnet, but it struck Roger Swift that there was a softer look on the hard, bold, sly face. He stopped short, and surreptitiously wiped his eyes ; for he was a man as easily moA-ed to tears as to laughter. \" We'll let the children alone, I think, Mrs. Apsley ;"], [100, "Vashti Savage. 96 they know better than Ave do sometimes,\" he said to the doubting, unconvinced woman, who, if she did not fear, like Mrs. Back in relation to baby Johnnie, that Vashti would run away with Miss Prissy and beg the country in her company, was by no means Avithout apprehension that the gipsy might not throw a spell over Mrs. Apsley's charge, as there were those in the servants' hall who did not hesitate to whisper that Vashti had bewitched Mrs. Apsley's master, and got him to do what the ugly, malicious monkey liked, until he had become a mere waxen image in her moulding hands. Mr. Swift was sufficiently impressed by the whole air of the group, on which he had refrained from intruding, to be able to possess his soul in patience during a conversation he had with Vashti later in the day. \" Her was allers like that ? \" suggested Vashti, jerking her arm in the direction of Prissy, who was just beyond hearing. She was standing at the open window of the schoolroom, which her governess had just quitted for the day, beside the afternoon tea-table, over Avhich she was learning to preside, when her father joined her, as he frequently did, in order to be, as he said, the one native of Brobdingnag at her dolls' tea-party. \" Ahvays,\" said Mr. Swift shortly ; for he shrank nearly as much as Prissy had shrunk from any com ment on her personal affliction."], [101, "Taming the Untamable. 97 \"And her ain't happy? \" pressed Vashti. \" I fear not quite,\" he was forced to answer sadly. \" But which of us can say anything else ? \" he added more lightly. \" Man never is, but always will be blest.\" Vashti took no notice of the qualification. She had no room for reserves and shades of feeling in her crude mind. \" I take it she were a Aveakly baby,\" she said, pur suing the current of her thoughts. \" You might ha' left her out in the cold, or forgotten to feed her, and her Avould not ha' suffered sore or long \u2014 just dAvined away and been at rest, and nobody been the wiser.\" \" Vashti, you are speaking high treason against God and His creatures alike. Some people would call you a monster, but I only say you're a thorough heathen. Of course we cherished Prissy, because God, who had made her so, could mend Avhat He had marred to her \u2014 could make it straight in her soul, I mean, if you knoAV what that signifies, in His own good time. As for us, as for me \u2014 it may be a selfish consideration,\" he said impulsively, speaking more to himself than to his listener ; \" but, upon my soul, my poor little Prissy \u2014 God help her ! \u2014 is more to me than all my well-groAvn and well-looking sons and daughters who have gone from me.

It was not supposed that she had run away for good \u2014 in fact, it was not known that she had levanted till she turned up again. Spiers supposed that she had been detained in the house ; the inmates of the house concluded that she had been sent to one of the remoter parts of the grounds and kept there by Spiers ; when Ben SAvift came upon her trudging homewards, looking fagged and footsore. \"Hallo, Vashti, what are you up to?\" he called to her. She told him a long, rambling story of having noticed the gipsies' mark on the stable-door, and knoAving from that gipsies were about, and had passed that way, she was tempted to slip off and follow in their footsteps, just to see if she could overtake them"], [105, "Bred in the Bone. 101 and hear aught of her father and mother. By the time she had reached the Scrub they had taken up their tents and.Avere out of sight; but she had been enticed after them as far as Wood Basset, only to find they were gone from the old field there also. There was nothing incredible in the story, except Ben recollected, when he had done listening to it and had gone into the house, that Vashti had been advancing in the opposite direction to that of the Scrub and Wood Basset when he encountered her. The same afternoon a great hue and cry was raised by nurse ; a string of Roman pearls that had belonged to Prissy's mother when she was a girl, which the child was allowed to keep, had A'anished from the little box in the drawer in which Mrs. Apsley could swear she had seen them safely deposited the night before. It was not so much the value of the necklace as the asso ciations connected with it which rendered it precious. \" Mamma's pearls, which her papa gave her when she was a young girl like me. Oh, I would give everything rather than they should be gone !\" moaned Prissy. There was hardly time for speculative theories, linking the loss of the pearls with Vashti's half-day's absence from home. To bring so grave a charge against the girl, however it might sound to her, was a serious proceeding, which called for serious thought and deliberation, and proof positive to substantiate the"], [106, "Vashti Savage. 102 accusation, and before the unwelcome suspicion could take form the necklace was returned to Mr. Swift by a jeweller in Crownleigh, a little market-town eight miles off. The necklace had been in the jeweller's hands before when he was repairing the clasp, so that he was at once able to recognise the pearls when they were offered for sale in his shop by a gipsy girl of not more than eleven or twelve years of age, whose parents had doubtless put her forward to dispose of the stolen property with a little less chance of the theft being brought home to them. The girl had told the jeweller the usual fable of having found the necklace on the high-road. He had been inclined to stop her, take her before a magistrate, and get her committed to prison ; but, as she said that she was in the service of Mr. Swift, an assertion which the jeweller had accidentally learned was true, he had thought it better to detain the necklace on the plea of ascertaining its worth, make a future appointment with the girl, and in the interval communicate with Mr. Swift, returning the pearls, which might already have been missed, and warning him of the kind of person he kept gathering fallen leaves and Aveeding in his grounds.

Ben had not cared for the tea-drinking, but he had strolled into the schoolroom, and had come upon Prissy exhibiting the pearls, among other child's treasures, to one of the few visitors with whom she was at ease. The explanation of her fancy for the gipsy girl lay in the attraction of reverses, in the proud consciousness that she, Prissy, had mastered herself and gained the victory in the unprovoked onslaught made upon her by Vashti in the dawn of their acquaintance ; in a vague sense that what nurse had said was true, and that Vashti's moral debasement and obliquity balanced Prissy's physical humiliation and distraction. If the last conclusion were correct, then poor Vashti was still more unfortunate than poor Prissy. The exclamations of the sister and brother called Vashti's attention to the slip she had made. \"'Cept, in course, when Miss Prissy showed it to me here, and Master Ben seed her do it.

Roger Swift was calm enough, though he was an excitable man. He Avas older, and had dealt with detected culprits of a higher calibre, Avho had asseve rated their innocence with about as much solemnity and assurance as Vashti displayed. \"We know all about it, my girl,\" he said, rather sadly than angrily, \u2014 \"about the long hurried walk to CroAvnleigh, the call at Honeywood's, the jeweller's shop in the High Street, the leaving the necklace with him that he might put a price on it, and the rush back before Spiers was likely to send up to the house to ascertain Avhat had become of you. You see you need not tell any more lies, Vashti, for they are useless.\" There she stood in sullen silence, not dropping her eyes, but glaring round her and panting slightly, more like a Avild beast at bay than a rational offender con victed of her offence. \" I will not ask you what tempted you to make this poor return for our kindnesses, since we have tried"], [112, "108 Vashti Savage. to be kind to you. I think even a gipsy girl may realise her failure in this respect ; for I have heard the ties of gratitude are strong and binding among your people.\" He paused for a second, and in that second her eyes, like glowing coals, did flicker and fall before his glance. \" I say this because I think it probable it is the only light in which the theft you committed will come home to a girl, brought up as you have been, as a wicked wrong. I shall not inquire what you were going to do with the ill-gotten money you sought to secure, when, as far as I can see, all your wants lately have been supplied in a liberal manner, which you could barely have conceived Avhen you tra velled in your father's waggon and dwelt in his tent.\" \" Money is allers ooseful,\" said Vashti, raising her head, and delivering the aphorism undauntedly. \" Mor'n gipsies like money.\" \" Ay, but they don't as a rule steal from their friends to get it,\" said Mr. Swift drily. \" If they do, they are, as you doubtless suggest, a deal worse than the gipsies. But there is no use talking, Vashti.

Father were in jile, and he corned out more of a ragin' lion than he Avent in. Don't take on so, Miss Prissy; I'se bear it. Thanks for your Avord, Master Ben ; I'se bear it. Gipsies is most of them acquainted with jiles.\" Roger Swift Avas not thinking of laying the girl of twelve \" in jile,\" as she said. He had not even made up his mind to send her to a reformatory. He was feeling, as she Avas incapable of doing, the extent to which she had been exposed and degraded before the two others, her contemporaries, to whom this was a painful lesson in the ingrained treachery and greed of barbarism. He would give her another chance : not simply because Prissy and Ben pled for her, though he had a difficulty in denying them anything asked within his power to grant \u2014 not merely because she said, \" I'se bear it,\" and begged Prissy not to take on about her, and thanked Ben for his brief intercession on her behalf; though in all these indications he seemed to see symptoms of relenting from her Ishmaelitish attitude, a faint foreshadowing of a better nature hidden by a rank overgrowth and Avell-nigh effaced. It belonged to the"], [114, "Vashti Savage. 110 man's character to be perpetually making allowances, finding excuses for his neighbours, and giving them fresh chances. It was .a weak nature if you will, swayed hither and thither by impulse and inclination as well as by fellow-feeling, one not incapable of straying from the right path on its own account, but eminently lovable through all. Mr. Swift took Vashti Avith him to Crownleigh to the shop of Mr. Honeywood, and expressed, in her hearing, not only his obligation but hers to the astonished jeweller, who had stopped her in her delinquency, and at the same time had tempered his righteousness with mercy by not calling in the police on the spot, so that she might have time to repent of her misdeeds and try again to be an honest and faithful girl. \" But if I were you, Mr. Swift, if I may take the liberty of advising you, I Avould not trust the young jade with the paring of my nail after this trick.

The vagabond in him or her will break out after three generations ; a gipsy sticks at nothing, whether burglary or arson.\" \" I am afraid you haA'e suffered, at some time, at the hands of such depredators, Mr. Honeywood,\" said Roger Swift commiseratingly, quite as ready to feel for"], [115, "Bred in the Bone. 111 and with an honest, industrious citizen, defrauded of the just reward of his integrity and diligence, as he had been smitten with pity for the ignorance and wretched ness of a wrongdoer. \"A respectable man like you ; it is exceedingly hard for you to be so put upon,\" went on Mr. Swift, carried away by his imagination. \" Well, I cannot say I have,\" said the Avorthy tradesman, in reply. \" 1 have been uncommon lucky in escaping shoplifting or even Avindow-breaking. But a man knows what is to be expected from such evil beings, and holds them at arm's length.\" On Mr. SAvift's way home he made a short detour in the drive in order to take Vashti past the county jail. It was an old-fashioned building, grim and dreary in its strength, with none of the architectural ornamenta tion and castellated embellishments with which modern taste seeks to soften and dignify even the exterior of a jail. Above the gloomy Avails one could just see the heavily grated Avindows. \" That is the place where thieves and cheats, brawlers and cut-throats are lodged, Vashti,\" he said to his companion. \" The light of day hardly shines upon them. Their only exercise ground is an inexpressibly dull and ugly courtyard within these high walls.

Occasionally there is a murderer Avithin the jail, and when he is removed from it, then it is to be hung by his neck till he is dead.\" For a moment Roger Swift realised the words he was speaking, and knew what it was to be a human outcast, a criminal, a murderer, and turned away with a shuddering recoil, thanking God in his heart for his deliverance from such guilt and misery. Not so Vashti. \" Bless your heart ! I ain't so green as not to know all about a jile,\" she said, Avith the complacence of superior knowledge. \" Didn't I tell 'ee father laid in jile oncet, and mother and me tramped to see him?\" \" I hope she does not think it is a sort of ancestral distinction, an inheritance she may claim with some pride, ' to lay in jile,' at least once in her life,\" her master reflected ruefully. \" I'm not sure that she ain't hankering after it.\" \" It bean't so big a place as father's jile,\" she said again ; \" but it bean't a pokey hole neither.

It's dark in there an hour or more before it is dark outside the Avails, and darkness in the Avoods and fields with the birds and beasts stirring all about, and the stars or the lady moon coming out in the sky, and the Avind blowing or the very rain falling, is one thing, and the blackness and dead stillness in a jile is clean another, father telled us, though he bean't a man o' words. The picking o' oakum is terrible tiring, sickening work, and jile gruel and broth is tasteless to them as has eat hedgehogs and the like. No, master, I think I'se keep out o' jile as long as I can. I won't never again steal no keys and no beadses from Miss Prissy, or from any other body.\" To escape punishment Avas not a very high motive to found a reformation and a new life upon, and it was more than questionable whether it would stand the wear and tear of temptation ; but at least it was better than no motive \u2014 the nothing to gain and nothing to lose of an utterly reckless creature.

The garden and avenue were chill and depressing, traps for colds, coughs, and rheumatism. Prissy was hardly ever allowed out of doors, unless warmly wrapped up for a drive. Ben would not be kept in the house. His father would not let him accompany Rust in creeping among the sodden reeds by the river for the chance of shooting wild ducks ; so Ben struck up a friendship with the huntsman of the nearest pack of hounds, and was ready to Avalk through mud and mire, to attend every meet, and get a glimpse of every run at some point or another. For his pony was getting too old, and Ben was getting too big and heavy for him to ride to hounds with any great hope of keeping up with the hunt across more than a couple of fields, far less of being in at the death. Vashti was left to her proper work of sweeping up and carrying away leaves, and helping to keep the walks clean ; for which purpose she was willing to be yoked into a roller, with which she would tear round the garden in a livelier manner than Spiers approved. She could not be said to shirk work, though if she had done what she liked she would only have worked by fits and starts, and lain in the sun or before a fire between whiles.

The result was that one day Mr. Swift found Vashti, to his alarm, sitting rocking herself to and fro on a damp bed of leaves, refusing to speak or stir, though she uttered no groan. \" The crazy Bet ha' got the toothache powerful bad, that's all,\" said Spiers, without Avasting much sympathy on so trifling an ill. \" I've told her half a dozen times to go to the kitchen to cook, or to my house to my old woman, and get a handkercher or a stocking tucked round her face, and sit by the fire till she's fit to behave like a Christian, and help with the pitting of the beetroot. But no, she'll sit there on Avhat is no better than a muck heap, and get the chills into her bones, while she nods her head for all the world like a dunce.\" \" Poor child ! poor Vashti ! \" said Roger SAvift, with ready kindness. \" Come with me to the house, and we'll see what we can do for you. Prissy has toothache sometimes. I believe there is a small medicine chest in her room crammed with pain-killers and harmless soporifics. Come, and she'll be proud to doctor you.\" \" I don't Avant doctoring ; the toothache bean't Avorth doctoring. I'se just bear it,\" maintained Vashti through her set teeth. But she had learnt enough of the habit of obedience to consent to rise and follow Mr. Swift. \" Here, Prissy, I have brought you a patient,\" said"], [120, "Vashti Savage. 116 Roger Swift, opening the schoolroom door. \" I know those who are accustomed to be patients are rather fond of having the tables turned upon us brutally healthy people, so that they may find themselves called on to cosset instead of being cosseted. 1 commit her to your care, only don't be long in your cure. I cannot stay another moment if our little trip is to be accomplished,\" he added. And before he had done speaking the door closed behind him. Prissy rose to the occasion, as her father had expected, full of importance and goodwill. \" Oh ! what is it ? Have you been hurt, Vashti ? We've sticking-plaster, and lint, and linen for cuts, and embrocations for sprains, and lotions to take the poison out of adders' bites. It is not an adder's bite, is it ? \" cried Prissy, Avith a thrill of mingled horror and excitement. Even nurse came forward, her instinct of helpfulness getting the better of her antipathy to Vashti. \" Can I do anything to help the poor girl ? You'd better let me see to her, Miss Prissy. She do look white about the gills, though she's that dun in complexion that it ain't easy to say Avhen she's sick and sorry.\" \" What's all the row about ? \" Vashti opened her aching mouth to protest angrily, while she stamped her foot. \" I ha' telled them it was nowt but tooth ache. What's the toothache ? I'se bear it.\" \"Why, Vashti, you're contradicting Shakespeare,\""], [121, "Bred in the Bone. 117 said Prissy pleasantly, \" for he wrote the lines, and my father read them to me once, \u2014 ' There was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently.' ' \" I don't care for Shakespeare and philosophers,\" said Vashti recklessly. \" Father smashed mother one time for disturbing him by getting up in the night to seek a nail to dig out a tooth as Avas shooting and stabbing like mad.\" \" Come away from the wild cat, Miss Prissy,\" said nurse indignantly. \" Leave her to bear her toothache as she chooses. For my part, I think suffering the toothache \u2014 which I've lost both my eye-teeth with bad gumbiles at their roots \u2014 is too good for her.\" But Prissy, though her sense of importance was lessened by the harmless nature of the malady, Avas only the more sorry for Vashti, whose every pang the other girl knew by memory, as her father kneAv it by the force of imagination. She submitted to be scowled at from the spot on the floor where Vashti had squatted in a heap, turning to her old practices under stress of circumstances, until Prissy could coax her into having her tooth painted Avith one specific and her face rubbed Avith another. At last, when the glow from the applications and the Avarmth from the schoolroom fire had begun to soothe and comfort her, Vashti leant back on the arm of a"], [122, "Vashti Savage. 118 couch behind her, and condescended to admit, \"Well, I'se a deal better, I is, and it's real nice to be out o' the cold and damp and into the heat, with nowt to do but wink and be waited on. I were never Avaited on afore, though to be sure to be Avaited on for the tooth ache is fair rediklous.\" \" But I've always been seen to,\" remonstrated Prissy Avistfully ; \" and we're happy to wait on you if we can do you any good.\" Accordingly Prissy tried all the pretty arts which she put in practice when her father nursed a headache for her benefit. It was a holiday, so there were no lessons and no governess to occupy her time. Nurse did not object again when she saw how Prissy was interested and taken out of herself. For the honest Avoman's regard for her charge Avas still greater than her respect for her own consistency, or her determination to vindicate her prejudices. Prissy got everything which she thought Avould do her patient good ; then she sat down beside Vashti on the floor, \u2014 the fair, Avhite child in her deformity and Aveakness, the heir of the civilisation of the ages ; and the dark young gipsy in her strength and hardihood, the product of centuries of savagery lurking still in Christian England. Prissy found that Vashti liked to hear a story Avhen read or told to her, and raked her brains to supply the"], [123, "Bred in the Bone. 119 invalid with suitable oral literature. By a happy hit the story-teller bethought her of the mine of stories in the \"Arabian Nights' Entertainments,\" and of which Ben had lately presented her with a much-thumbed copy. Vashti bowed to the charm of ladies changed into dogs and horses, and birds that spoke instead of singing, of caliphs marble from the middle downwards, of trees bearing glittering precious stones for fruit, and of genii who rose out of a cloud of smoke and got eA-erything that was asked from them, even rocs' eggs, which it seems Avere harder to procure than treasures of gold and silver. Ben strolled into the schoolroom, and cried, \"What's up ? \" when he saw Vashti installed on the floor Avith her face tied up in a bag, as Lady Nithsdale tied up hers Avhen she went to visit her husband in the Tower for the purpose of changing clothes with him. Ben did not make light of toothache. He interrupted what had been till lately his oavii favoured literature to say, \" Poor Vashti ! \" and to describe how fellows in his dormitory had tried salt and red-hot wires to rout the enemy, and had danced about the room from the effects of their own treatment. Some time before luncheon Prissy was summoned to speak to her father, but she returned presently, and took up her former post. She even kept it after Vashti had fallen fast asleep, sitting watching over her in a"], [124, "Vashti Savage. 120 wonderful motherly way, which completely disarmed nurse, and induced her to cause luncheon to be sent up to the two girls in the schoolroom. Vashti had learned to use plates and cups, knives, forks and spoons, under cook's conscientious super vision in the kitchen, still better than in the workhouse. She no longer gnaAved a bone as a dog would gnaw it, or tore at a loaf, or put her fingers into the broth or the tea, and her spoon into her neighbour's salt or sugar. But there was still so much to be desired in her perform ance that Prissy modestly looked every way save one, in order to aA'oid Avitnessing Vashti's eccentricities. In the course of the afternoon Prissy betrayed her knowledge of the fact that her father was gone on a railway journey to the next large town, and let slip that there had been some talk of her, Prissy, accompanying him for once. \" But I should have been certain to have had a head ache,\" said Prissy, bending her smooth, straight brows ; \" so I begged him to let me stay where I was, and I'm sure I've been much happier than I should have been in the toAvn.\" \" Eh ! you're a rare un to mope,\" said Vashti, some what scornfully. \" To think noAV you chose to stay here when you might have had the shops and the crowds o' company ! \" \" I suppose I am a ' rare one ' not to care for the"], [125, "Bred in the Bone. 121 shops and the company at our age,\" said Prissy, with a little pathetic smile ; \" but, you see, they don't care for me saA'e as a customer, and I'm in the way of busy people hurrying along the streets. I cannot Avalk fast. They have to stand aside for me, and then they look at me half spitefully, half contemptuously,\" ended Prissy, Avith a quick sigh. \" Why dunno you look back at them, and make faces as would fright them ? I can make terrible ugly faces,\" announced Vashti, with proud confidence in her own powers. Disregarding her recent toothache, she put her little fingers into the corners of her eyes, and her thumbs into the angles of her mouth, and grinned in a manner which showed she had not exaggerated her capacity. \" Oh, don't !\" cried Prissy, in genuine alarm. \" The wind Avill change, and you'll be always like that, or you'll take a fit or something.\" Then she tried to divert the zealous performer's attention. \" I've asked my father to bring you something which I meant to get for you at Christmas ; but since you're ill and want cheering, I think you ought to have it noAV.\" The idea of a present to herself was so strange to Vashti that she did not half take it in, and Avas not even interested to speculate Avhat it might be. When it came it was a string of gay red and green glass beads.

Then when he and Vashti were by themselves he read her a lecture, in the course of which, though he succeeded in touching her a little, he was still much the more moved of the two, for he Avas an emotional man in all things, religion included. \" I wish to let you see, Vashti, Avhat Miss Prissy has been doing for you to-day, and in Avhat spirit she has acted \u2014 my dear, magnanimous, gentle Prissy, in spite of her fits and whims.

She is fond of pictures ; so fond that it even OA'ercomes her shyness at going among strangers ; and I had managed so that she could get a priA'ate view of the pictures.

But I want you to consider Avhom the girl or boy, woman or man, most resembles who has self-denial and kindness to spare for poor little hurts and bruises, that strong brutes who are often cowards at heart would trample upon as they pass by.\" He hesitated for a moment, and then added Avith a certain shamefacedness, as of one who felt his unworthiness to deal with such a topic, and abhorred to approach it lightly, \" You know something of the Lord Christ who"], [129, "Bred in the Bone. 125 died in the room of sinful men and prayed for His enemies, don't you ? \" \" Yes,\" said Vashti, \" He were nigh as good as Uncle Reconcile.\" Her master did not accuse Vashti of pro fanity, or recoil from her as blaspheming in putting Uncle Reconcile first. Probably the man, whoever he might be, formed the highest standard, human or Divine, that had ever been fairly presented to this girl or come within her comprehension. \"And who and what was Uncle Reconcile?\" asked Roger SAvift softly. \" I like his name, though, may be, it was a chance title, without any more appropriateness than names generally have.\" \" Uncle Wisdom telled mother and me about he,\" said Vashti, almost with enthusiasm. \" He were young, and oh ! so handsome and clever, and that liked, though he took up Avith the Methodies, and went again' many gipsy fashions.

DAYS and weeks passed till Christmas was at hand. Vashti Savage was still at Water Basset. She had even with the shortening days of Avinter weather crept farther into the family.

The household had somehow come to regard it as a matter of course that it should have an odd gipsy satellite circling round it, had grown accustomed to Vashti's pranks, as people get accustomed to almost anything under the sun, as families in the long past are said to have grown used, with the familiarity that"], [132, "128 Vashti Savage. breeds contempt, to the capricious gifts of fairy god mothers, the eccentric services of brownies, even to the childish, mischievous, and teasing behaviour of such a foolish, fantastic ghost as was supposed to haunt the early home of the Wesleys. Occasionally a qualm crossed the minds of cautious seniors ; and mere on lookers, less affected by constant contact with the object in question, persisted in regarding Mr. Swift's conduct as Quixotic and rash in attaching in any form a young gipsy to his establishment. Such folly, they said, was tolerably certain to reap its fit reward. In spite of the qualms and censures Vashti stayed on, and the longer she stayed the less likely she was to go, especially after the sickly, deformed girl of her own age had taken a fancy to her. For it was well knoAvn that, adopting their cue from Prissy's father, who was a good master, and from all the goodlier feelings of humanity, nobody in the usually orderly, smooth going household, from its highest to its lowest member, was ever anything save kind and considerate to its young mistress, and reluctant to thwart her. If some of the other young masters and mistresses, who found the busy world more attractive than the leisurely retire ment of Water Basset, had come home for more than a flying visit, they might have taken sufficient interest in what was going on in the nest from which they had all flown to find fault and remonstrate ; but each was"], [133, "The ATeiv Head of the House. 129 too full of his or her own concerns, and had too little time to spare for what was in the main their father's and little Prissy's affair, to trouble about such a trifle as the imprudent taking up or the discreet letting down of a gipsy protegee, training for a future maid serA-ant. Ben was a great deal too much of a boy to interfere ; besides, he hated crossing Prissy almost as much as her father hated to do it ; and Ben rather liked Vashti on her own account. If she AA-ould give over lying and stealing and SAvearing occasionally, she was rather a jolly girl, though he could not hope to profit much longer by her lessons in rifling pigeon-houses and cooking hedgehogs. Vashti did not give up stealing, lying, and SAvear ing on occasions Avith such rapidity and thoroughness as could have been wished. Her progress was fitful, full of slips, falls, and backslidings for many a day. She kept her word so far as not stealing again from Prissy was concerned ; and when she saw how much her petty pilferings of apples and carrots, handkerchiefs and stockings from the washing, even down to boot laces and hairpins, affronted and distressed her small patroness, she left them off by degrees. It was a matter of time and longsuffering patience. In the same manner she no longer lied with her former effrontery. She began to look abashed when she was 9"], [134, "Vashti Savage. 130 caught in an untruth. She became furiously angry Avhere she had formerly been stolidly indifferent Avhen she was unjustly accused of falsehood. She ceased to say the words which made Prissy shrink and silenced Ben. In other respects Vashti's temper Avas less flighty and violent, though hers Avas still a long Avay from a meek and quiet spirit. Mr. Swift had tried to carry out the provision for national education by attempting to have Vashti in structed at stated hours, as she would have been in a Board school. But here he found himself baffled and foiled. She either could not or would not acquire book learning. Her sharpness and shrewdness utterly failed her ; she was as dull as ditch-water. Her head was as thick as the most substantial millstone ; she grew as cross as tAvo sticks. She was nearer to run ning away and being on the world again than she had been since she came to the great house at Water Basset. Vashti was too old or too knowing in some things, and too hugely ignorant in others, to take kindly to her letters. Her gipsy blood and original training proved an insuperable obstacle. What does the- School Board do Avith vagabond children who can not or will not learn ? Mr. Swift treated his specimen as a bad job. Ho did not see what good would be gained by forcing"], [135, "The New Head of the House. 131 Vashti to struggle after attainments, so much against the grain that the struggle threatened to drive her into the wilds again. He was anything save a foe to education in the mass. He had no faith in ignorance for the preservation of virtue and the prevention of vice in the lower any more than in the higher classes. But he remembered old men and women, his father and mother's contemporaries, who had been respect able members of rustic society, sober, decent, hard Avorking, church or chapel going, good sons and daughters, good husbands and wives, good fathers and mothers, good servants, though it had not been their fortune to compass reading and writing. He did not believe that all the defences of society, any more than all its dangers, were bound up Avith \" the three R's.\" If Vashti declined to know her letters, she did not refuse to go to church, and she behaved herself there and at family prayers considerably better than could have been looked for, though she occasionally emitted deep sighs over the length of the service, or rose up and \"flopped\" down again with a startling suddenness and emphasis. The latter performance was more due to bodily restlessness and \" fidgets \" than to spiritual depravity. She was almost fond, by comparison, of verbal instruction of any kind, religious as aveII as profane, and continued to like to have stories told or read to"], [136, "Vashti Savage. 132 her. The more sensational the stories the better she was pleased ; so that she gave in her adherence to the latest fashion in light literature, which may be said to offer food to the extremes of human intellect \u2014the minds lying fallow and in want of all culture, and the minds over-cultured to a condition of jadedness. When the Bible Avas read to Vashti she showed a strong preference for its earliest records, the lives of the patriarchs, the wanderings of the children of Israel, the Book of Judges, especially the Book of Job in its first and last chapters, though the whole grand, inspired poem, dimly as she understood its drift, had a singular fascination for her. In the New Testament there was only one history she cared for, and happily it Avas that of the God-Man, whom she always as sociated with her Uncle Reconcile. This kinsman's pathetic fate was the one heroic, tender record, written in letters of light on the dark page of her childhood and youth. Before Christmas it was settled, to Ben's chagrin, that he should read with a neighbouring clergyman, who received day pupils, instead of returning to his public school. An over-walk in pursuit of the hunt had done as much as a fall from the object of Ben's ambition \u2014 a high-stepping hunter \u2014 might have done, in renewing those symptoms of headache and giddiness for which he had been originally invalided after the"], [137, "The New Head of the House. 133 blow from the cricket ball. No sooner was the matter settled than the unfavourable symptoms died away, so that poor Ben declared in his strong language that the whole thing was like a great swindle, while he himself looked a veritable impostor. It only consoled him a little to knoAV hoAv glad Prissy was at the change in the arrangements for his education, and to be sensible on his part that his being at home rendered life less dull for her. As for his father, he Avas neA'er dull ; he always found something to occupy and interest him on his daily return from town. But the truth was, he had been less at home this autumn than his children had ever known him. He had come across some old intimate friends at Bath, and he had visited them there and at their place in Dorsetshire repeatedly during the last three weeks. He must haA-e been aware that he had shown some inconstancy to his old loves ; he Avas therefore anxious to collect as many of the scattered members of his family as he could get at Water Basset this Christmas. Even with all his pains he was not altogether successful. He could not bring Tom from India or Ned from Australia for the occasion. As it happened, Mary's husband, the London lawyer, was laid up with gout, and she could not leave him. There was an epidemic among Charlie's patients, he could not turn his back upon. Besides, between ourselves, he would prefer to look in"], [138, "Vashti Savage. 134 on the governor in summer and early autumn, when he, Charlie, might have a little fishing and shooting, to serve to pass the time in an out-of-the-world neighbourhood like Water Basset. As for Annie, the nurse, it was not her turn to leave her hospital, even if she had not been suffering from hospital sore throat, and dared not venture into a region where she was creditably informed the annual rainfall amounted to so many inches. She believed her father could not know it, or else he would try to be rid of the remainder of his lease of Water Basset. But Mr. Swift secured Arthur, the land agent ; Alexa, the Welsh vicar's wife, Avho was not forced to stay at home Avith her vicar and her small family ; and Clara, the artist. She was over in England before shifting from a Dresden to a Munich studio, and she must in any case have taken breathing space from haunting the Avinter galleries in London to run doAvn and get a glimpse of her father and Prissy and Ben, in anticipation of her flight back to Germany. The collection was not complete ; but the addition of even so many persons as two women and one man to a family circle, in itself small and secluded, changed its entire character, and filled it with temporary stir and bustle. Everybody's attention Avas engrossed, and at the same time nobody felt quite at home and at ease. All were soon wishing that the party, which was posi-"], [139, "The New Head of the House. 135 tively incongruous and discordant, though its members Avere of one strain of blood, Avould break up and set each other free. Alexa, who had taken her tone from a musical neighbourhood, wanted to go back to her choir-practising and the AA-orking up of her share of the musical festivals. Clara longed for her studio and her sketches in monochrome and polychrome. Arthur belonged to a literary and scientific society, for which he was preparing a paper, and to a political club of ad vanced opinions diametrically opposed to those held by his father, neither of Avhich could well exist Avithout him. Prissy and Ben, to whom their grown-up brother and sisters had none but kindly intentions, felt lost in the babel Avhich had suddenly arisen in the house. The}- secretly pined to have it to themselves again, to be once more the presiding spirits and persons of chief importance, which their father had permitted them to become \u2014 not the mere young people whose plans and anticipations might be set aside at any moment accord ing to their brother and sisters' will ; and a mere Avaif like Vashti was utterly effaced, except in the hearts of the faithful. \" A girl of gipsy extraction in the scullery, did you say ? \" exclaimed Clara, looking up from an exercise in perspective. \" Would she make a good subject for a sketch ? What is she like ? Little, Avith a bad squint, do you say ? Oh, that would never do ! \""], [140, "136 Vashti Savage \" Has she any voice ? \" inquired Alexa. \" Did you ever hear her sing any Gitano songs ? Some of them are pretty ; but I fancy they are all spurious \u2014 mere make-ups. If you never heard her sing, depend upon it she is not musical, for ' out of the fulness of the heart the mouth speaketh.' \" \" I have heard her yell, if that is to the point,\" said Roger Swift. It was not to the point, and his daughter looked a little offended. \" I suppose she is too young to have picked up or retained much Romany,\" mused Arthur. \" One of our members is to have an essay on tongues abstruse, exploded, or in abeyance. If she had been a proficient in Romany, and could have coached me in a feAV days, I might have given him a wrinkle.\" There the question of Vashti dropped. Roger SAvift's elder children had too much to do in the pres sure of this world's claims upon them, even to inquire Avhether their father might not be nourishing a serpent in his bosom. It was not till Christmas Day, after the family had been to church, that Roger Swift kept them sitting round the table, where they had lunched, with the abrupt announcement that he had something to say to them. It was high time he said it, for Arthur was leaving that very night, in order to complete his paper and have it read for the meeting of the society early"], [141, "The New Head of the House. 137 in January ; Alexa had to start next day, in order to sing the \" Bells of Aberdovey,\" at a charity concert in the nearest market-town to the vicarage ; and Clara felt she had better go in the same train as far as the junction with her sister. It was not pleasant to travel alone at such a season ; but she would haA-e daylight to get to Mary's house in toAvn, Avhere she was only awaiting a telegram, which might arrive at any moment, to tell her that there Avas room for her in the Munich studio. Mr. Swift Avas clearly agitated as he prepared to ad dress the audience of his children that he had gathered together. He Aviped his forehead, though the weather was seasonably cold, and gave a preliminary clear of his throat, as if his communication stuck there. Instantly his agitation communicated itself to the younger generation waiting for him to speak. What had he to say ? Was he seriously ill without their knowing it? Had his affairs gone wrong ? Had any thing happened to Tom in India or Ned in Australia ? Ben ceased cutting an orange skin into a mitre, and Prissy in her chair beside her father pressed closer to him. \" I wished to have you all here,\" said Mr. Swift in his manly, flexible voice, that just shook a little before he got it under complete control, \" to tell you something it concerns you to know, which I think it is"], [142, "138 Vashti Savage. right you should hear a little time beforehand. I am going to marry again in the course of the spring. I trust you will approve of my choice when you make the acquaintance of the lady. Her name may not be altogether unfamiliar to you, though you do not any of you know her, herself. She is the sister of my old friend Colonel Woodward, whom I met often \u2014 we had not come across each other for a number of years be fore \u2014 in the beginning of last summer. She is a good woman about my own age. I have every reason to think she will make me happy, and be an excellent friend to Prissy and Ben and all of you if you will let her. Perhaps I had better add that she is a woman of independent fortune. I shall of course make a suitable settlement on my wife ; but the marriage need not materially affect your prospects, unless, indeed, for the better, since she will eventually share the expense of maintaining this establishment.\" He gave the last argument in favour of his marriage in a hurried, half-gruff, half-pompous way, unlike him, and sufficient to show that it went against the grain Avith him to bring it forward. Nobody had spoken or stirred except Ben, who had cried, \" Father ! \" half under his breath, and Prissy Avho had quivered all over. When a man announces his second marriage to the children of his first wife, it is not easy for the most"], [143, "The New Head of the House. 139 ready-witted and self-reliant to know what to say. This is still true when such a length of time has passed as to preclude any charge of indelicate haste or slight to a memory Avhich is still green in the hearts of the surA'ivors. \" Have you any objection ? \" asked Roger Swift quickly, Avith a twinkle in the eyes, which were still bright and of a violet blue like Prissy's. The humor ous side of the situation Avas already beginning to strike the man, open to eA-ery impression. \" None in the world,\" said Arthur briskly. He was a man of the world, and dreaded an aspersion of his common sense above all things. \" Of course, father, you are fully entitled to take the step which you propose. We haA-e nothing to say against it ; Ave can only trust that it Avill be as you say, and you are the best judge for your comfort and happiness.\" \"And for that of the lady?\" suggested Roger, by way of amendment on Avhat now struck him as rather a selfish proposition. \" And for that of the lady,\" agreed Arthur. \"Yes, father, I am sure we wish you all happiness, though I must say you have taken us by surprise ; not that there is any great call for wonder,\" said Clara. She was an honest, someAvhat muddle-headed young woman, next in age to the younger of her married sisters. She had not been without various twinges"], [144, "Vashti Savage. 140 of self-reproach at leaving her father, Prissy, and Ben so much to themselves since that gadder abroad, Annie, would either be nursing or paying visits. Noav, with a well-to-do stepmother to take care of the house, and very likely make pets of the children, and spend her spare money upon them, Clara might pursue her art from Cologne to Diisseldorf Avith a clear conscience. \" I am of the same opinion as Arthur and Clara,\" said Alexa deliberately, having taken time to consider that her vicar would no longer have it in his poAver to suggest that, in place of rushing up to town for the Handel Festival, or to hear Patti or Neilson, she ought to go down to Water Basset and see what her widowed father and young brother and sister were doing. \" I can speak for David also ; he has always worried over your loneliness, and at the two children's having no female friend with them \u2014 nobody but nurse and that day goArerness of Prissy's, in whom I can put no faith, since her musical system is simply deplorable. May I ask if the lady, Miss Woodward, is musical ? \" \" Upon my Avord, I am not sure. I think she Avas in her day,\" the future bridegroom answered, far too carelessly in Alexa's opinion. \" But you must remem ber, Alexa, that was in my day, not yours.

Still, for aught I can tell, her musical"], [145, "The New Head of the House. 141 system, judged by a modern standard, may be as deplorable as that of Prissy's friend.\" \" Oh, I hope not,\" said Alexa, with a gravity that Avas almost stern. \" It would be terrible to have the grand piano, which cost two hundred guineas, on which it is a pleasure to play, belaboured by another Miss Lowe.\" Anxiety for the fate of the grand piano was not the only thing which was troubling Alexa, to do her justice. It had just occurred to her that Annie and Clara might discern, Avhen it was too late, that the place which they had voluntarily vacated was no longer theirs to fill when they chose. Roger Swift was vexed by Prissy's silence, though it might be excused in the youngest person present' and though he had not appealed to her in the company of older people. \" Have you got nothing to say to me, Prissy ? \" he asked, a little sharply. \" You will have a good deal in your power to make your new mother and me happy or unhappy. I trust you will do your best to be a good, obedient girl, contented and cheerful with her as well as with me.\" Prissy, whose every nerve was still pricking and throbbing, whose heart was sore and heavy, could not stand this. \"She is not my mother!\" she said passionately;"], [146, "Vashti Savage. 142 \"she will never be my mother! Oh, father, how can you do it ? How can you bring a stranger here to come between you and me, and to scorn me ? It is nothing to the rest of them there. They will go away to live from home as they have always done. But I thought I was something to you, and that I should be more still as I grew older ; and now you are going to bring in a stranger to rule over me and mock me!\" He could do nothing save look at her in pained surprise and displeasure, though in his inmost con sciousness he knew exactly how she felt, and his heart Avas wrung because of what he Avas inflicting on her \u2014 in truth for what ? To gratify a moment's kindly impulse, to make a cunning, cowardly provision against probable danger in the future. In the aAvkward pause Avhich followed Prissy's outburst, she stumbled from her chair and left the room. \" I am afraid that poor child has been horribly spoilt,\" said Alexa, speaking with all the authority of the mother of a family. \" I should be very sorry to provoke such consequences where my children are concerned. Certainly none of them has the bodily defects of poor Prissy, I am thankful to say. But where is the good of humouring her shyness and over sensitiveness, and letting her grow up fearfully self conscious ? She ought to be sent to school and"], [147, "The New Head of the House 143 hardened; she ought to be accustomed to have her deformity seen and spoken about.\" \" I think you are hard upon Prissy, Alexa,\" blurted out Ben. \" It is only poor little Prissy. Who minds when she takes a tantrum, or gets into a wax, or has a maggot in her head ? She's as good as gold under it all. I can tell you there is none of us half so good. Father, Avon't you stand up for her ? It is you who have made so much of her, and spoilt her, if she is spoilt.\" \" I will stand up for Prissy against the whole Avorld, my boy \u2014 never fear ! \" said Roger Swift, recovering himself, and looking three-quarters touched and one quarter amused. The family party, unexpectedly called upon to sit in conclave, separated, \u2014 Arthur to arrange for his night journey, and to forget his essay in trying to call to mind what fellow of his acquaintance had spoken to him lately of his father's old friends the Woodwards, and Avhether he could be credited Avith some general know ledge of their affairs, so as to be able to confirm or contradict his father's assertion \u2014 on the grounds for which he might have been misled \u2014 that they were in good circumstances, and that the lady whom Mr. Swift proposed to marry Avas the reverse of a needy spinster, who had inveigled him into furnishing her with a home and a future jointure. Alexa and Clara were repairing"], [148, "Vashti Savage. 144 to each other's bedrooms in turn, in order to hold confidential communications and serious consultations. The two sisters came to the conclusion that it was a comfort their father was not going to set a chit of a girl younger than his elder daughters over them, to Avhom, though they need not have much to do with her, they would occasionally have to pay deference, as to their father's wife. They were saved the probable injustice of a second family to lessen, if the children did not swallow up, the inheritance of their elder brothers and sisters, and likewise spared the sickening spectacle of an elderly man dandling babies, with the certainty that he would be close on his second childhood before they were out of their first. So much was to be granted even when the matter Avas viewed soberly, even sadly. On the other hand, if Miss Woodward were a woman of fair fortune, as well as respectable family connections, she would be an available ally for the absent members of the family to have at Water Basset. The second Mrs. Swift \u2014 though, of course, it was a trial for them to hear her called by that name \u2014 would take their father into society again, and would restore some thing of the old pleasant hospitality and liveliness to the house ; while she would have all the trouble and responsibility of taking care of its master, looking after Prissy and Ben, and entertaining company. She would remove an unconfessed obligation, which, however"], [149, "The New Head of the House. 145 lightly it had sat on their shoulders, had galled them at times, when more persons than Alexa were in question. As for Prissy, she was sobbing her heart out in her old nursery, obstinately refusing to tell nurse what ailed her ; only protesting when Mrs. Apsley, in her vexation for her nursling, cried out, \u2014 \" Is it any of these fine trapesing madams, your sisters, Avho have vexed you, Miss Prissy, my pet ? I'll have it out with master. I'll know the reason he suffers them, as never puts a foot in the house, except for their own pleasure, to tease and affront you. He's too easy a gentleman for one and all ; that's what he is, though you're the light of his eyes, and no mistake.\" \" No, no, nurse ! \" denied Prissy. \" What should I care for anything they did or said to me ? My father does not care for me as you think. He does not care Avhat becomes of me.\" \"My dear child, are you crazy, to talk so wickedly? \" exclaimed the perplexed woman. \"Why, he AA'ould not let the wind blow too roughly upon you. He is always contriving treats for you.\" But at that moment Ben came in, calling, \" Where is Prissy ? What is she doing ? \" and gave the expla nation in his half-blustering, half-affronted, schoolboy fashion. \" The truth is, nurse, my father is going to be married again.

NEVER was there woman less calculated to take all hearts by storm and win the affections of young people and servants on first acquaintance than Sarah Swift, nee Woodward. One would have said never was woman worse cut out for being an elderly stepmother, or for rising suddenly, late in life, into the atmosphere of conspicuous dignity and importance which surrounds the mistress of a large establishment. Miss Woodward, though she possessed a fair fortune, had spent nearly all her earlier years in the society of aged relatives, who led a very quiet, retired life, in keeping Avith their infirmities, to whom she had always been in a state of tutelage, in whose dim eyes, in fact, she had continued, to the last, the girlish Sarah she had been a quarter of a century before. She was to come out of this shady retreat, with its formal manners and"], [152, "148 Vashti Savage. clockwork habits, into the glare of day ; she was to assume the functions of matronhood as the wife of an elderly widower Avith a large, scattered family, and the mistress of a once popular country house ; she was to rule a staff of domestics, who had been most of them many years in the service of a master that had made friends of them and indulged them to the top of his and their bent : it \"was like an owl or bat deserting the congenial twilight and stillness of a shady ruin, and attempting to fly in the full light and noise of noon. The second Mrs. Swift was a tall, thin, colourless woman, wearing spectacles, and certainly winking like an owl behind them. Her manners had the shy stiff ness which is easily mistaken for pride and coldness. She was timid and nervous to a degree that, in a Avoman of her age and appearance, would have tempted any save the best behaved and most attached of juniors to make game of her. She was extremely conscien tious, and had come to Water Basset with the fixed determination to do her duty to all at Avhatever cost to herself. Several of the old servants only Avaited to see the glasses of her spectacles turned upon them to give up their situations. Wilson, the fat coachman, who was careful never to drive unless he and his horses felt inclined, apprehended that the new madam would be wanting him to take her when and where"], [153, "Freshly Installed Matrons. 149 she thought fit, and could not stomach the interference Avith his liberty. Cook said she had always been trusted, and she could say, like Samuel, that she had Avronged no man, though she had had nothing to do with asses ; she had not taken a crust which was her master's, or interfered Avith another servant's perqui sites ; but she could see at once that this last Mrs. Swift would not be pleased to rely on cook's good character, and on her master's confidence in her of many years' standing. She Avould want to go over all the accounts, and satisfy herself that they were correct. Cook, who was a woman of a candid cast of mind, Avas not prepared to say this Avas Avrong in itself, only she had not been used to it at Water Basset, and she would rather quit at once than have all her old agreeable relations and associations with the place disturbed. She had been too long Avithout a mistress, and too happy and respected in her state of independence, to relapse with a good grace into a condition of entire subordination. Nurse, who, since Miss Prissy was old enough to pass partly into the hands of a day governess, and since Miss Clara had taken to painting, had slid into some of the duties of a housekeeper, such as taking charge of the household linen, etc., rebelled equally against having to go over an inventory with Mrs. Swift, and being called on to repair, classify, and arrange the stores in which"], [154, "Vashti Savage. 150 she had taken pride, according to the notions of a lady who knew nothing about Mr. Swift's household linen, and his likes and dislikes where it was in question, and not according to nurse's superior knowledge and experi ence. She had a great mind to follow the example of cook and Wilson, were it not for poor Miss Prissy, whom nurse had taken out of Miss Prissy's mother's arms when the blessed innocent was a baby. So long as the new-comer did not interfere with what nurse did for Miss Prissy \u2014 and Mrs. Apsley thought her master would see to that \u2014 she would stay on and protect her charge at all hazards. These changes in his household Avould have been disagreeable to any conservative-spirited, indolent, genial-tempered man. They were particularly so to Roger Swift, and he was sometimes driven to ask himself Avhy he had provoked them ? why he had not been content to leave well alone ? He was sensible that he had not exactly made the movement on Ben and Prissy's account, though he was satisfied that, to a certain extent, he had their interests at heart in what he did. Neither Avas it purely to make friends of the mammon of unrighteousness. He had known Sarah Woodward a good many years ago, and had thought her rather a lovable girl then. He had been pleased to come across her again after a long lapse of time.

Old associations had carried the day with him, or rather he had been touched and flattered to find that, while he had almost ceased to remember her existence, his influence over her had continued undestroyed by years, absence, and his marriage. She still blushed faintly when his name was mentioned, her eyes still fell a little before his, she still trembled slightly when he addressed her. He had not been deliberately guilty of trifling with her affections in the old days when the two were young together, but when he was a very attractive fellow, whom few women could altogether resist, he, whose life was in the light, had not been able to help making an impression on her, whose life was in the shadow. The consciousness of this had been sacred to him, and he had been very much touched by finding that after all these years and changes the im- pression had not been effaced. He had been the one love of her life ; she had been one of the female friends, of whom in all honour and honesty he had possessed a few, in addition to the wife to whom he had been passion ately attached. The next step to a man of his tempera ment, in the full career of renewing a youthful friendship with her brother, was to lay what remained of his life and fortune at Sarah Woodward's feet, and afford her the satisfaction of accepting or refusing them. She"], [156, "Vashti Savage. 152 accepted them ; and the two were in the process of awakening to the results of what they had done, while both man and woman were too loyal to shirk the con sequences. Ben opened his eyes at the sight of a stepmother who could not say \" bo \" to a goose, who screamed at the sight of a mouse, who wriggled when she came in contact with a caterpillar or an earwig, and was in terror of a quiet cow no less than of a mad bull. She inquired with blushing hesitation about his flannels, and was in distress because he skated on the pond where the ice was inches thick, though he kept his word to his father not to risk the deeper end of the little lake, so that if he did fall in, on an average twice a day, he was never wet beyond the waist. A hen, with a reckless duckling instead of a decorous chick, was never more tryingly situated than poor Mrs. Swift was with Ben, or, as she persisted in calling him, \" Benny.\" She Avas not any better, she was a good deal worse, with Prissy. Ben had the half-developed instincts of a man and a gentleman to a woman and his father's wife.

She was a bundle of sickly nerves. She had Jjeen practically her own mistress, unless where her health was in question, since she was a baby. Everybody at home, including her father, had deferred to her and humoured her. Mrs. Swift had been educated on a rigid system, and her whole conception of education was based on the same cut-and-dry, inelastic method. She was deeply concerned about the young girl ; but was persuaded that the first and best thing she could do for her was to subject her to laAvful authority, to put her in her proper place, and to enforce on her rules and ordinances. It was a trial to Mrs. Swift to do this ; but if it was for Prissy's good she would do it. Prissy must get up precisely at the hour named by her doctor, and take the breakfast which he recommended Avithout fanciful alterations in the boiled bread and milk, or the beaten-up egg, or the bit of bacon. The doctor and those older than she was knew what was good for her, not Prissy herself. So Avith the rest of the day : she must prepare her lessons, practise, take her airing, play at any fit young lady-like play, appear at lunch, have her schoolroom tea, and go early to bed by rote. To insure this it was high time that she should be removed from the guidance of an ignorant, opinionative woman like nurse, however faithful and devoted, and transferred to the care of a"], [158, "Vashti Savage. 154 staid, superior governess, such as Mrs. Swift would look out and install as soon as nurse could be super seded \u2014 that is, as soon as she would subside into a valuable upper servant, and resign the control of Prissy. Prissy suspected what was in the air, and after beginning by shrinking from her stepmother as an umvarrantable intruder, was in a fair way to hate her as an intolerable tyrant. In some respects Prissy, the product of blighted culture, was, in the middle of her formality and self-consciousness, as wayward as Vashti, the offspring of rude barbarism. Prissy detested to be tied down in hours, meals, books, anything ; but she could have forgiven it all if she had not been kept away from her father, and if somebody had not come between her and him. The act was quite involuntary on Mrs. Swift's part ; indeed, if Prissy could have realised it, the separation was more the doing of her father than of his wife. Roger Swift was aware that many of the new institutions were substantially beneficial to Prissy and everybody concerned, and he felt bound to support their framer. At the same time he could not endure to witness their imposition, or to resist Prissy's piteous appeals. The weak strain in him induced him to withdraw almost treacherously from the contest, and naturally Prissy put all the blame on her stepmother."], [159, "Freshly Installed Matrons. 155 To Vashti Savage Mrs. Swift, with her bungling reforms, her martyr-like staunchness to her smallest convictions, her short sight, her tremors, her physical cowardice as contrasted with her moral courage, was a supremely absurd being ; and Vashti was instantly on the qui vive to play tricks on her, to betray her into the path where the turkey-cock stood boiling over with a bully's rage, to shake surreptitiously spinning jennies and daddy-long-legs from the rose-tree and honeysuckle doAvn on the trellis-work above the sheltered garden-seat, where Mrs. Swift Avas fond of sitting on a mild day with her needlework or her book. Mrs. SAvift had a horror of gipsies, and was dismayed to find a young gipsy girl installed in her kitchen \u2014 at least in her scullery. She had also an unreasoning aversion to a squint, and was inclined to believe, as the middle-age painters believed of red hair, that it not only lent an evil expression to the countenance, but was the sign of a wicked disposition. But she was too just a Avoman to act as far as she knew on fancies and prejudices. She contented herself with pointing out to her husband the interest which Prissy took in Vashti, and deprecating it. \" My dear, does it not strike you it is a very unsuitable association, and that it would be better if Prissy were forbidden to speak at all to that dreadful-looking girl ? It is terrible to think what Prissy may learn from her.\""], [160, "156 Vashti Savage. \" Then don't think of it,\" recommended Mr. Swift lightly; \"think only of what she may learn from Prissy. You are conjuring up bogies, my dear Sarah. Poor Vashti is not at all dreadful, whatever she may look. We have had a good many months' experience of her. I do not say she is immaculate ; indeed, I strongly recommend you to look after your jewel cases, though I have not heard of any recent depredations of hers.\" \" But this is dreadful,\" protested the alarmed lady, opening wide her weak eyes, while her thin hair stood on end, \" to keep a dishonest girl about the place ! Besides, she may have been one of a gang to whom she may open all the doors and windows during the night.\" \" Not she. And if she opened all, don't you think we should catch her at it ? This is a case where knoAvledge and not ignorance is bliss. We are well acquainted with Miss Vashti's propensities, and so can guard against them. And ' dreadful ' is not the word. Remember she is a gipsy, and stealing comes as naturally to her as \u2014 what shall I say ? \u2014 tidying your desk or your work-basket comes to you. But she is not half a bad sort. She is a wonderfully fearless creature.\" \" You do not think fearlessness the most desirable quality in a woman, do you, dear ? \" inquired the timid woman wistfully."], [161, "Freshly Installed Matrons. 157 \" Oh dear ! no,\" said the complacent husband, re collecting himself; \"but it is a factor, as people say nowadays, in a certain kind of truthfulness ; not that poor Vashti is truthful in the ordinary sense ; she has been brought up to lie and steal ; and, as she is a girl of fair abilities, has proved an apt scholar. Yet I am persuaded she is originally, in the human nature which is deeper down and more ineradicable even than the gipsy nature, frank and sincere. She and Prissy are about the same age ; and when poor little Priss first began to notice the other \u2014 to whom she was uncom monly good, mind \u2014 I Avas only too glad to get her to take an interest in anything.\" \" Of course you did it for the best, Roger. I did not for a moment dream of reflecting on you,\" said his wife, Avith the deferential, affectionate, admiring gaze up into his still handsome face, Avhich always disarmed him. \" I can understand that it has not been good for Prissy to be always among grown-up people. I suffered from that disadvantage myself.\" \" If the result is the same it is not to be dreaded,\" he said gallantly. \" Oh, nonsense ! \" she said, blushing like a girl at the careless compliment. \"But if you desire a young maid-servant to Avait upon Prissy, don't you think a well brought up, prettily behaved girl could easily be had from the Rectory school ? \""], [162, "158 lashti Savage. \" I doubt if Prissy Avould care for her ; she was taken by Vashti's laAvlessness and gross incivility.\" \" Excuse me, but I think that was a pity. And Benny \u2014 Benny talks to this girl too.\" \"Oh, you may leave Ben to take care of himself. It will be a few years yet before he is in danger from the attractions of young women, even if Vashti showed the smallest sign of developing such attractions. You speak of the children's speaking to Vashti when they come across her, as if they were condescending too far. Do you not know that she considers herself the daughter \u2014 a good way off, it is true \u2014 of the kings of the East?\" \" Absurd ! \" exclaimed Mrs. Swift, who had not a particle of imagination or an atom of humour ; while her grandfather Woodward had been a bank porter's son, Avho had risen until he became a partner in the banking-house which his father had served in the humblest capacity. Ben, who did his best at first to keep the peace, thought disconsolately that Mrs. Swift's absence of charm and trying Avays would have been less hard to bear, if a new mistress had not just then come to the Rectory, who was Mrs. Swift's opposite in all super ficial and a feAV fundamental respects.

In this light she quite outshone the Rector, just as she Avas a tolerably long step above him in rank. Mr. Neville Avas an unobtrusively good, hard-working clergyman, Avhose qualities would certainly groAv on his parish ioners ; but he was not dazzling either in rank or in anything else. He was thoroughly respectable and meritorious \u2014 that was a great deal, but that was not striking. His father was a well-descended squire, Avhose acres from various reasons had shrunk as the columns in his bank-book decreased. Mr. Neville himself, with all his genuine worth, was never likely to be a bishop, or even a dean, unless his wife's family and personal influence Avon for him the lawn sleeves and the apron. How he had won her was a mystery between the two, and the only light throAvn on it was that she never sailed to declare he was worth a hundred like her. Lady Grace Neville Avas the daughter of a nobleman some time dead ; the sister of an earl, who was a man of intellectual mark and power, in addition to his landed property and titled influence, indeed he held a subordinate office in the Cabinet, of which it was thought he would one day be the chief. Lady Grace had stooped to marry the man she"], [164, "Vashti Savage. 160 loved, and had not once shown that she regretted it. She had been a devoted helpmate to him ; she had only been tempted a very few times into conduct which was more in keeping with an earl's daughter than with a parson's wife. Her family had disapproved of the marriage, but had forgiven her in time, and she was so great a favourite with them, as with everybody else, that she could, if she chose, have soared high above clerical circles, and been only a bird of passage there, while all her energies might still have been engrossed with the great world of which she had been a denizen. But she did not so choose. People said that she set little store on her rank \u2014 she made far fewer distinctions than the old Rector's wife had made \u2014 and that if it had not been for her title nobody need have known that she was the late fox-hunting Earl of Barton's daughter, and the present distinguished Earl's sister. She never spoke of her brother and his wife, who was a duke's daughter, entitled to special consideration if ever Avoman was, as \" the Earl and Countess,\" but simply as \" my brother John and his wife.\" Just as she addressed her sisters the Ladies Barton as \" Molly and Kitty.\" But there were other people who were not so sure of Lady Grace's indifference to her rank. These captious individuals noted the fact that when the Earl and Countess of Barton were at Water Basset the Rectory doors were closed strictly, not merely against what"], [165, "Freshly Installed Matrons. 161 might be called the parochial element, but against the minor squires and bigger professional men Avith their wives and families, Avho were Avelcome to the house on other occasions, and with whom Lady Grace was on the most gracious terms. It was not supposed that the temporary exclusion was due to the Earl and Countess, who Avere reported to be not only particularly affable in their degree, but to cherish a special desire \u2014 praise- Avorthy, or simply inquisitive, as you might like to take it \u2014 to get behind the scenes in middle-class houses, and be able to weigh the sentiments of middle-class people. Another token which critics of Lady Grace's perfect humility laid hold of was her management of her only child Gracey. Gracey was allowed to go eA-erywhere and know everybody as the Rector's daughter. But it Avas only as the Rector's daughter. She was the pet of the parish, but it Avas always in a parish sense. If she was invited anywhere or treated in any way on her individual merits, it was speedily announced that she had home obligations, a young girl's lessons which must on no account be neglected, or that her midsummer holidays were promised to her aunts at Barton Meadows, and her Christmas and Easter weeks to her Uncle John at Barley Mote. It Avas whispered that her very grandfather and grandmother Neville saw little of the girl, who, when she was not parish property, Avas bespoken for an enchanted circle of elite. IT"], [166, "Vashti Savage. 162 However, if Lady Grace retained aristocratic weak nesses, they were kept Avell in hand ; they were not permitted to become aggressive, and they did not inter fere with her duty. She was rarely absent from home, even in the season. She worked with and for her husband early and late. She did a great deal of the train ing of the village choir, giving them the advantage of her own splendid musical education. She played the organ for week-day services. She Avas unremitting in her attendance at the Rector's school, and at all devotional and charitable meetings and clubs. Her bright face and winning manner smoothed aAvay many a difficulty. Her presence was as familiar in the cottages as that of her husband, and was if anything the more popular of the two, unless with the very sick and sorry. They liked her too, for she was always generous and kind, but they preferred, by an unerring instinct of which she Avould have been the first to approve, the man who was slower in speech and duller in manner, but whose patience never failed, for self had been cast out of him. He did not heed what they thought of him, but simply cared for how they acted and felt in relation to God Almighty, Avho was their Heavenly Father, and men, who were their brethren. With all her busy hours and laborious days, Avhich Avere no affectation, Lady Grace had still spare moments for play and to make others play, and she played with"], [167, "Freshly Installed Matrons. 163 right good will. None skated like her on the mere. She got up popular concerts, and sang at them to the delight of her hearers. She Avas the presiding genius at feasts of all kinds, from school feasts to harvest feasts. Her cordial Avords and merry laugh inspired great and small. Her rare escapades Avere not merely pardonable, they were likable. One day, Avhen Lady Grace was out riding Avith her daughter Grace and a groom, the little party came across the path of the hunt. Lady Grace looked longingly at the pink coats, the huntsmen, the horses, the dogs. Then she hastily bundled off the young lady and the groom Avith a message to the Rector, and put herself under the care of a much-honoured, heavy farmer, Avho Avas also a keen sportsman. Ben Swift happened to be following the hounds that day, under difficulties too ; for his step- mother had been so alarmed by his father's proposal to let him ride one of his hunters, that Mr. Swift thought it better to withdraw the offer. Thus the boy found himself, to his intense disappointment and chagrin, still sentenced to his feet and his old pony. But Lady Grace Neville Avas not much better mounted ; for she had gi\\'en up her riding-horse to her daughter, and Avas riding the Rector's hack, which Avent messages and carried the Rector at long intervals OA'er to Crown leigh. Ne\\-ertheless, she kept up with the run wonder fully. Ben kneAv by experience that it was by the"], [168, "164 Vashti Savage. greatest skill and pluck she did it. He watched her still slight and elegant figure, and gloAving, piquant brunette's face, as she threaded every labyrinth and surmounted every obstacle. She made the hack take the leaps Avhere they Avere practicable in a marvel lously neat, clean manner. Where there Avas no help for it she made considerable detours, cleverly hitting on the points at which she was likely to find again the fox and the hounds with the best riders in sight. When the brush Avas won, a feAV fields from her, she turned round and disengaged a hand to shake Ben's, and congratulate him in a way that sent his head up, and made him flush Avith pride and gratitude. She classed him with herself, as if he had been a groAvn man, and as good a rider as she was. \"We have done pretty well, Master Ben, under stress of circumstances.\" He did not know which was prettier or pleasanter to hear \u2014 her thanks to the heaA'y farmer, who came up, himself and his horse blowing alike, after her, when she spoke as if she fully belieA'ed that he had guided and taken charge of her throughout the morning, or her openly expressed penitence to her friends in the field, who soon flocked round her, for having forgotten for half a day that she Avas a parson's Avife, and only remembered that she had come of a fox-hunting family, and been taken to meets by her father as soon as she"], [169, "Freshly Installed Matrons. 165 could sit on a pony, Avhich was before she had mastered her letters. The sound of the horn and the cry of the hounds, with the feeling of a horse under her, had been too much for her. It had been like the song of \" John Peel,\" Avhich she did not think she could hear sung in a public street without joining in the chorus. If Ben's father had but married a Avife with a tithe of the spirit and sweetness of Lady Grace, everybody might have taken to her, and found her the greatest acquisition at the great house of Water Basset. The two newly installed matrons did not fraternise. Mrs. Swift was staggered .and stunned by Lady Grace's volatility and volubility \u2014 not that the Rector's wife could not be quiet and serious on fitting occasions \u2014 and all her good deeds did not suffice to reassure her neighbour. Lady Grace complained to her cronies that she had turned herself \" inside out\" in order to secure in return a little of that slow, cold Avoman's confidence, or even have the satisfaction of entertaining her literally, not as a figure of speech. What was all she had for her pains ? A gape, a stare, or \" Oh, indeed ! \" or \" Could you really ? \" The game was not worth the candle. Then Lady Grace did pity those two extinguished young people \u2014 the poor little hunchback who ought to have everything bright and cheerful around her, and the fine lad Avhom the stepmother would do her best to turn into a molly-coddle. But even Lady Grace in"], [170, "Vashti Savage. 166 her most vehement strictures did not anticipate the crisis at hand. Prissy was told she was not to speak to Vashti, though Mr. Swift had said, when she came first to Water Basset, that they were to see what they could do for her, and had made a present of her as an English savage to Prissy. They had all borne Avith her \u2014 nurse and cook and all. Prissy had forgiven her for nearly causing the loss of her mother's Roman pearls. They had been all more or less proud and pleased to think that they were civilising Vashti, and making a respectable Christian girl of her. And now to be told by a stranger, who had not known her or taken any trouble with her, that poor Vashti was not to be treated like common flesh and blood, just because she had made a face and had not curtseyed, or said \" ma'am,\" or complied with some other piece of old-fashioned, narrow-minded obsequiousness. Nurse was going too. Nurse had actually been goaded into forsaking her nursling rather than submit to the unjustifiable interference and injudicious contrary instructions of the new Mrs. Swift. Nurse's case was a peculiarly hard one. She had been with much trouble carefully instructed by an enlightened physician, until she had got rid of her foolish scruples and traditions, and was resolute in bracing Miss Prissy by as much of fresh air and cold water as the young girl could stand."], [171, "Freshly Installed Matrons. 167 Then the second Mrs. Swift appeared, with all the exploded dread of freshness and coldness revived in full force. Miss Prissy was not to go out when the wind was in the east ; she Avas to wear a thick jacket, however much it might oppress her, till it was the month of June; her bedroom Avindow was to be sealed; she Avas to have none save tepid baths. \" It's no use appealing to master,\" groaned nurse; \" he'll only say perhaps we have gone too far with the bracing system, and recall all the bad colds Miss Prissy had last Avinter, and forget that it was he himself who brought the most of them on, overheating the house with them sickly hot-water pipes, to make it fit for a fidgety old maid, as should have stayed still where she was, and welcome ! \" Mrs. Apsley was so left to herself as to remark, \" I sha'n't stay to see all my work undone, and feel myself answerable for looking on and having my poor lamb, Miss Prissy, killed outright or bed ridden within three months !

I'll go while I can hold my tongue, as Wilson and cook have gone.\" So nurse went likewise ; and Prissy, who had found few to love her during her short, clouded life, and had loved them passionately, was on the brink of despair."], [172, "CHAPTER IX. REBELS, THE juvenile world, like the old servants' world, in the great house at Water Basset was on the eve of rebellion against one of the most well-meaning, tender-hearted women in the world. And it was worse with the young people than with the old ser vants ; for the revolt of the latter had been open and fair, according to all the established rules of Avar, while that of the latter Avas necessarily smouldering, sullen, secret, and deceitful. Prissy, over-indulged to begin Avith, acutely sensitive and passionate, with her poor health suffering from the strain, and rendering the burden of her misshapen, ailing body worse than it had ever been before, was very miserable. But she could have endured what she had to submit to, and been at once too proud and too loyal, with too strong a sense of her obligations, girl as she was, to rebel, had it not been for an element in her character which, if not overcome in time, was"], [173, "Rebels. 169 tolerably certain to wreck her life. A great part of her passionateness arose from her devouring jealousy with regard to the affections of those she loved. She had an exaggerated consciousness of her defects and fail ings, with a corresponding aching distrust of the regard eA-en of those nearest and dearest to her ; she Avould have all or nothing from them. She did not pause to consider; she had never been clearly taught to weigh the grasping, grudging, mean spirit which Avas thus fostered. It formed as great a contrast to what was really magnanimous in her as Avhat Roger Swift belieA-ed he discovered of human candour and fairness in Vashti was in direct opposition to what was also hereditary, and had been the acquisition of many generations in the arts of falsehood and theft. The chief objects of Prissy's feA-erish, exacting tender ness were her father and her brother Ben. Over the latter she still held almost undisputed sway ; but Mrs. SAvift had come between Prissy and her father, and Prissy could not bear the riA'alry, and was full of keen resentment against her rival. Ben could not endure to see Prissy made what he called \" a galley slave\" to small rules and petty forms. She had to keep her hair always in order, and her frocks and aprons spotlessly clean, in order to be ready to come doAvn to the drawing-room when she was sent for, whether there were visitors there or not. She had"], [174, "Vashti Savage. 170 to be prepared to repeat so many namby-pamby verses of Mrs. Swift's selection to that lady every day, no matter hoAv Prissy's head had ached, and Avithout any reference to the fascination of the book which might have come into the girl's hands. Prissy Avas missing her nurse, the familiar friend of her whole life, at every stumbling step. She Avas con templating with positive loathing her transfer presently to the care of an elderly governess of Mrs. Swift's selection, Avho Avas probably as demure, narrow, and rigid as herself. Prissy Avas fretting her heart out at being denied constant access to her father, and when she did reach him, at no longer finding him always disengaged and at her service. She was looking paler, sharper, more pinched, more like an old woman than a young girl, every day she lived. And Ben had grievances oh his own account. His father had been inclined to reconsider his decision about not sending him back to his great school, with its flush and buoyancy of life, its multitude of boyish companions and boyish sports, treated with the gravity they deserved, as well as its multitude of tasks. In the end Ben was firmly persuaded that the balance would have turned in the right direction had it not been for that \" old hen.\" Alas ! Ben called her so in his thoughts at first, and afterwards in the hearing of Prissy and Vashti, who caught up the disparaging title.

Lady Grace Neville had taken a fancy to the boy ; and on the occasion of a visit paid to her by her brother John's sons, Lord Raby and the Honourables Jack and Bob Barton, invited Ben every day to the Rectory to help her and her daughter entertain their guests. There was no room as yet for snobbishness in Ben's sound, boyish nature, though his father was not above relish ing his boy's consorting on the most intimate terms with the sons of a future prime minister.

Lady Grace's invitations were declined thenceforth with prim politeness, at which the lady lifted her delicately arched eyebrows.

But somehow she rose to the injuries which she too conceived were inflicted on Prissy and Ben. Her brown face, Avhich had kept cool on her own account, flamed up for them. Her cross-set eyes shot forth more oblique and positiA'ely diabolical looking glances ; she spoke stronger, fiercer, worse sounding words, drawn partly from the mixed gipsy, partly from the low Avorkhouse vocabulary. The words were utterly foreign to Prissy, and not much"], [177, "Rebels. 173 better known to Ben ; but, in spite of their ignorance, the tones made them sicken and shh'er. Yet such re taliation as Vashti attempted was entirely foolish and childish, and was in the old line of introducing toads and cockroaches on the premises, giving false alarms of imaginary mad dogs that had been seen to bite Turk, the Avatch-dog, Avith the letting loose of the said Turk on every opportunity. And when Mr. Swift slept in town, and his trembling Avife was left the principal custodian of the great house and all its treasures, Vashti regularly announced the arrival of burglars about to get in at the skylights, and of depraved small boys preparing to creep through the pantry windows. Ben was contaminated and unsettled, and latterly idle ; for he was doing badly with his tutor, and rapidly losing self-respect on all hands. With the stolidity of a boy he began to aid and abet Vashti in her petty warfare. When Roger Swift suspected the collusion, he was exceedingly indignant, and threatened to flog Ben for the first time since he had been a boy of ten. Her master deliberately pledged himself to send Vashti back to the workhouse, and have nothing more to do with her, if he discovered her in another impudently malicious prank. He sharply reprimanded Prissy, who had been passiA'e in the matter, for not informing upon her friends and allies.

But he Avould not need to send her away, or to flog Ben as if he were a horrid boy in a reformatory, such as she had read of, or to turn Vashti back on the workhouse, all because of her, Prissy.

He felt exceedingly nettled and indignant with his children for not seeing as he did. He did not mean all he said, especially where Prissy Avas concerned, but he meant enough to make him appear altogether obdurate. Prissy, Ben, and Vashti Avere together one afternoon, when Mr. and Mrs. Swift were out driving, returning their marriage visits in company. The assemblage in an unfrequented summer-house was in itself a breach of orders. Neither should Prissy, according to her step mother's behest, have been out of doors after her morning's constitutional walk, for the Avind Avas one point in the east, though it was a sine spring day, with the primroses blossoming in the hedgerows, and the birds beginning to sing in the coppices. But the truth was the whole of life in the great house at Water Basset was now overgrown and intersected by a netAvork of prohibitions and interdicts, Avhich, like the ceremonial law of the Jews, appeared to exist largely for the purpose of showing that it was impossible to keep within the bounds imposed. Wittingly or unwittingly some one or other of the load of fine fetters Avas being incessantly broken.

Vashti Avas squatting, according to old habit, on the floor ; she was thoroughly enjoying the situation, for she had taken in the new cook by feigning sickness, and getting herself sent to bed. And she did not like many things better than to sit on the floor and do nothing except keenly sympathise with the wrongs of Miss Prissy and Master Ben, instigate them to further disobedience and disorder, and extemporise fresh mischief to harass the enemy. Vashti, in her orthodox scullery-maid's calico wrapper, canvas apron, and little muslin cap (she was understood to be in her fourteenth year), was no more like a steady, docile, embryo English domestic, and no less like a young gipsy, than when she had been in her rags and tatters a year before. Ben had not quite so much relish for the position ; but he had some grim, fearful joy in it, particularly after his father had said that he Avould flog him if Ben again mixed himself up with any of Vashti Savage's doings, or took Prissy anywhere against the wishes of Mrs. SAvift. Prissy as usual came off the Avorst ; she was only a shade less miserable in the tenanted summer-house than she would have been in the empty draAving-room, or with Mrs. Swift's maid, who imposed on her mistress, and was an affected, loquacious woman, with a Ioav standard of honour eA'en for her type. She was willing to tell all sorts of silly, slighting stories"], [181, "Rebels. 177 of the mistress who trusted in her and Avas good to her, if Prissy would meet her half-way and make her complaints to the maid, when she would betray the girl as she had been willing to betray all there was to tell against the lady. Prissy saw through this woman, from the mincing smile which Avas intended to hide her false teeth to the barefaced pretence that poor Prissy was handsome and like other people. \" You would not have cared to go with my father to the Bullers,\" said Ben to Prissy, \"so there is no loss there. You may be glad the hen did not catch you and take you against your will, and then we should not have had our nice confab here,\" he ended, with a strangled yawn. \"In such weather as this last year,\" said Prissy plain tively, \"my father would have taken us, not to make calls, but to gather primroses and anemones and the first violets, or to sec what the young lambs were about. I have not picked a primrose outside the garden or seen a Iamb this year. I am so sick of the house and the schoolroom and drawing-room ! \" she finished, with a long echoing gasp, as if she were in Avant of air. \" Poor Miss Prissy ! \" said Vashti, Avith real com miseration. \" But her won't stand in your way allers, see if her will. Her will be took in some sort, you'll find.

I'm sure I don't desire any judgment to come on Mrs. Swift, and she may live as long as Methuselah for me.\" \" I say ditto,\" said Ben, with such emphasis that his board went see-sawing and he with it, holding on to it. \" But she has been an aAvful SAvindle of an old hen. If she would only let us alone to mind our own business, I'm sure we shouldn't meddle Avith her. She might stitch and keep up her important correspondence and read her out-of-date books, while we are not to read a magazine which she has not looked into and approved of beforehand ! I say it is enough to make a fellow take to bad literature. She might hang on my father's arm till she was tired for anything I should care. But she will come clucking after us, and calling us back from everything we care to do, making a spectacle of herself and fools of us. I do not know how my father can bear it. Last night, when the Kirbys were here, I was in the drawing-room, though you Avere sent to bed at your usual hour, Avhich was a big shame, since you like the Kirbys \u2014 she might have found that out with all her spying and prying \u2014 and what did she not do, when I Avas going out with Tiny Kirby to hunt a moth we saw strike against the window pane, but call us back, in case we should be tempted to go on the grass, after the"], [183, "Rebels. 179 shower, and wet our feet !

Castor and Pollux.\" \" Her's ill-Avished,\" said Vashti gloomily, and vigorously biting a straw she had picked up. \"Shut up, Vashti, and don't be a humbug !\" called out Ben, before resuming his narrative. \" I think my father was a little affronted,\" said Ben loftily ; \" but I suppose he did not care to call attention to his Avife's folly.\" \" She Avouldn't ha' done it,\" said Vashti, not to be repressed, and speaking confidently, \" if she had got the stick took to her, as A\\-ould ha' done her a world o' good.\" \" Wiry, you are a woman yourself \u2014 at least a girl ! When you grow up and are married some day, do you mean to be beaten ? \" \" I marry, to be loundered by any man ! Not if I knows it!\" cried Vashti in shrill scorn. \" If I could only get to Aunt Alicia,\" murmured Prissy, engrossed by her own woes, and not heeding the lighter by-play of the others. \" I say, that is not a bad idea.\" Ben sat up, and gave it as his opinion. \"Aunt Alicia might help us. She might take you in, and get my father to send me back to school.\" If the brother and sister had known much of their Aunt Alicia on Avhom they thus counted, even their"], [184, "Vashti Savage. 180 simple minds and sanguine hearts could hardly have missed the conclusion that she was about as unlikely to trouble herself with them, and to get herself into the least annoyance on their account, as any mortal under the sun. She was a selfish single woman, fine lady, and semi-invalid, sentimental as such women often are, but with no more honest, unsophisticated motherly heart, which many a spinster possesses, than Avould have sufficed for a smirking doll. She was the Swifts' mother's sister, and Roger Swift had felt himself bound to tell her in due time of his second marriage. He did this in the most kinsmanly way, in a letter containing the assurance of his continued friendship, and stating that he hoped he might still and always consider himself privileged to continue the little addition to her income which he had made for a number of years. He received in answer an effusive epistle, lauding the regard he had shown for her' beloved sister's memory by remaining so long single, exalting his generosity, wishing him every happiness, and virtually giving him her blessing. At the same time Aunt Alicia had written to \" poor dear Prissy,\" expressing her tender sympathy with her. It was too hard, just when she was getting old enough to feel it, for her father to put another woman, a stranger, in the place of Prissy's darling mother and Aunt Alicia's favourite sister. But men, the very best"], [185, "Rebels. 181 of them, were not to be depended upon in such matters. No doubt Prissy Avould be the chief sufferer. She must make up her mind to Avhat she Avould have to bear, and at the same time try to assert herself from the first. For she was the only home daughter, and she was certainly entitled to some consideration in her father's house. Her Aunt Alicia's heart bled for her all the same. On receiving this letter Prissy was conscious of Its disloyalty to her father, and she put it away hastily, as if she herself Avere a domestic traitress for having read it. But she got over the feeling ; and, as things became Avorse, she took to conning and reconning that worse than foolish epistle, clinging to it as a drowning man clings to a straw, bringing herself to believe in its idle, plausible professions, and totally losing sight of the curious circumstance that Aunt Alicia had never once put herself about to haA'e her dear motherless niece in her charge. Indeed, the aunt and niece had not met since Prissy was a baby, Avhen the former had registered a silent vow to have nothing to do with the miserable crooked little thing, doubtless as crooked in mind as in body. For Aunt Alicia Avas of too highly strung a nature to undergo Avithout injury such a depressing contact. Plainly, her first duty was to herself, to prevent her mind from dwelling on painful facts, or her feelings being harroAved by the contemplation of evils which were beyond her cure."], [186, "Vashti Savage. 182 Vashti had not even heard of Aunt Alicia before ; but she boldly made a suggestion Avithout an instant's hesitation. \" I'se run away to my aunt if I were you, Miss Prissy.\" \" But how can I run aAvay ? \" asked Prissy impatiently, and trembling from head to foot at the bare proposal. \"Aunt Alicia isn't just across the park here, or o\\'er at Crownleigh. She is as far aAvay as Kew, in the neighbourhood of London.\" \" I'se go to her,\" repeated Vashti. \" Me and Master Ben Avill help you.

Prissy, Avho had an artistic nature like her father's, was much alive to all the influences of the outer world. During these last few genial spring days, though what wind there was had been a point to the east, she had been thirsting intensely to be freed from the clogs which hampered her, to get away from the dull routine of the schoolroom and the formal magnificence of the drawing- room, to be in the open air in the garden, the park, the meadows, all day, or the most of the day, as nurse, well taught her duty, had formerly taken care Miss Prissy should be, in the brief fine weather of an English spring. Not the gipsy Vashti had been more tormented and beset with the necessity of having the spring round and round her, and Avithin her, than poor Prissy had felt. When Vashti spoke, Prissy had been longingly, deliriously picturing to herself, as Avith a SAvift flash, Avhat it would be to profit by the glorious Aveather, to get aAvay from all her troubles, and to forget them, close to the ever young earth in its first fair attempts at greenness and floweriness.

I wanted to let them off on your birthday, Priss, to cheer you up and amuse you ; and wouldn't Vashti here have stared and jumped ?

It would take us a week, I daresay ; and if Prissy's money held out to pay for our \" peck \" and our lodgings at night, she could never do it. Besides, the police would be told, and handbills would be printed and circulated all oA'er the country,\" declared Ben, speaking as if he were reading from a police report, while his eyes were opening wider and wider at the imposing dimensions the escapade threatened to attain. \" Perhaps they would get our photographs \u2014 mine and Prissy's, for I don't suppose you have one, Vashti \u2014 print likenesses from them, and send them every - Avhere with the handbills,\" went on Ben, his imagina tion warming with the exciting nature of the topic ; \"anyhow, we should be stopped, as sure as fate.\" \" If us went to the next station, Avhere we bean't known, and started from that pint ! \" Vashti made the amendment eagerly.

We might get off the road, and find ourselves lost and benighted.\" \"But that is the best of it, the Plain is,\" insisted Vashti. \" Us shouldn't have to keep to no road, and nobody could call us to order.

They are that lonesome, they be right down pleased to see a strange face.

Ben should have known a great deal better, for he had some small acquaintance with the world. But"], [193, "The Plot Thickens. 189 the fact was he lost his head before a vision of camping out, living for days and nights among the shepherds on the great Plain, carrying off Prissy and Vashti from the dragon's den, and escorting them single-handed like a gallant knight-errant to Aunt Alicia's at Kew. The great difficulty, naturally, was to get away without being missed and arrested on the spot. At first this huge obstacle, together with the securing of a long enough start to afford any reasonable hope of their successfully evading pursuit, appeared so nearly in surmountable that Ben declared despondently, over and over again, it was \"No go!\" The governor might lose a little time seeking some or all of them at the house of Prissy's nurse's cousin, Avho was married to the blacksmith in the A'illage, at the Scrub where there were gipsy tents, at the station, at the Rectory, at Ben's tutor's, but these hopeful decoys would soon be used up ; and if he sent the servants and went himself and scoured the roads, to a moral certainty the truants would soon be overtaken, and it Avould be all over with their expedition. Prissy was ready to sink back into peevish sub mission and disconsolateness ; but Vashti was staunch as a sleuth-hound, and indomitable as a rough, pug nacious terrier. At last, as good-fortune or ill-luck would have it, a. possibility of overleaping the worst barrier presented"], [194, "Vashti Savage. 190 itself. At dinner in the drawing-room one evening, Mr. and Mrs. Swift not only talked of paying another and more distant visit next day, while the fine weather lasted, but Mr. Swift suddenly made up his mind that the road was too far for his horses, and arranged to stay the night at the hotel in Crownleigh, and transact some business which he had to do there in the morn ing. Mrs. Swift felt considerable misgivings at sleeping out of her own house in even the best hotel of a country toAvn, where Mr. Swift was well knoAvn and much respected, but where she could not trust to the beds being well aired and the water properly filtered, or to getting bread of the right degree of staleness, and coffee of any save a mediocre quality. She was also anxious about the welfare of \"the children\" left twenty-four hours without their natural guardians. But if she with her foibles played unconsciously on the good-nature and indolence of Mr. Swift, it was certain, on the other hand, that in what concerned their mutual convenience, in questions into which the most tender conscience could not enter, his word Avas law to her. He could if he would smooth down her gravest objections, and set aside her most rooted habits to suit his plans. For the poor lady would have walked meekly, well-nigh cheerfully, to the stake to serve him and his. \" Oh, laws ! ain't it a chance?\" cried Vashti, ready"], [195, "The Plot Thickens. 191 to clap her hands Avith ecstasy had it not been for a discreet fear of being seen and heard. She had been told the good news by Ben after he had slipped out to the fowl-house, about which Vashti was hoA-ering under pretence of seeing that the early chickens were safe under their mother, when a stray cat was miauling near. \" You wunnot throw no more cold water on our lark now, will you, Master Ben ? And Miss Prissy, sure her'll never lose so grand a chance for want of seizing it ? \" \" We'll see, Vashti. I ha\\-en't had time to speak to Prissy yet. I just gave her a look.

Neither Ben nor Prissy could sleep that night, though Vashti might have been a dormouse laid up for the Avinter so far as any wakefulness on her part went against the similarity. And Prissy looked so pale, with such dark rings under her eyes, that Ben feared her face would call attention to her, and either the hen would stay at home, or she would take it into her head that one of the chickens should bear"], [196, "Vashti Savage. 192 the parent fowls company. But Mr. Swift wished to set out early, and he contrived jocularly to cut short his wife's innumerable and somewhat jumbled preparations, precautions, and exhortations. The pair were gone, and the conspirators were left to their wicked devices. The first thing was to call another council of war, when Vashti professed to be scouring the milk-pans in the dairy, to enable the dairy-maid just to run down to the village to get a dress tried on. At Prissy's solitary hint that her head ached badly, and that she was a little doubtful of her power to walk far that night, the two others made a great outcry about her drawing back. \" When it was you who first thought of stealing a march upon my father and Mrs. Swift and going to Aunt Alicia,\" Ben told her in reproachful accents. \" It is chiefly on your account that I am going into an affair for which I have no doubt I shall pay in the long-run. My father may forgive a girl, but he will have it out with a boy like me. He wanted to flog me the other day; and I'm sure I shouldn't mind being flogged if it were not the governor who did it ; \" and here even Ben's gruff young voice gave way a little. \" He only talked of sending Vashti back to the Avork house, and seemed to think you hardly wanted to be spoken to.\""], [197, "The Plot Thickens 193 \"And I have told such a many stories to cook that I'se never get out o' them now,\" complained Vashti. \" Forby, it is a fair sin to lose so grand a chance as has been sent us.\" \" I'll not stand in their Avay. They'll not have to say that I first got them into a scrape and then refused to go through with it,\" said proud little Prissy to herself. Then she intimated to her company that she was their woman. She would go to Aunt Alicia, though she fainted on the road. And what would she have to tell the lady, with whom she was fain to take refuge, of the proA'erbial cruelty of stepmothers ? Mrs. Swift sent Prissy to bed at nine o'clock ; Aunt Alicia would undoubtedly send her to bed at eight if she were in the way, and if there were anything else to engage the attention of the couple of maids and the boy in buttons in the little house at Kew. Mrs. Swift made Prissy sup on good bread and-butter and an abundance of the best new milk ; Miss Alicia would not think it worth while to provide other than last year's salt butter to the bread, and the drop of Avatered skim milk, which the cat had not stolen, that had been left over from tea. Altogether, if Mrs. Swift had lashed Prissy with whips, Aunt Alicia would lash her with scorpions. They were all in for it, as Ben said with a kind of subdued triumph, and Vashti assented with unholy glee. 13"], [198, "Vashti Savage. 194 Alas! alas! a great many more stories than Vashti's fictions had to be told or acted before the young people could go without being instantly sought for. The house was far too Avell governed and orderly for any thing else to be possible, even in the absence of its master and mistress. For the same reason, though it was of the utmost consequence that the three should get as far out of reach as might be before Mr. and Mrs. SAvift's return next' day, it was not practicable for the fugitives to start until it was already getting dark on the short spring day. The combined inventions of the trio were not sufficient to forge a dinner invitation for a boy and a girl, the latter of whom never went into company ; so that Prissy and Ben had to show themselves at the schoolroom dinner, over which Mrs. Swift's maid, in lieu of a higher functionary, presided, while Vashti had the opportunity of again eating heartily at the hall table, to which she had been recently promoted. In the course of the afternoon Miss Prissy's head got so bad that she had first to lie down and then to undress and go to bed for the night, charging Mrs. SAvift's Allan to be sure and not awake her by speaking to her, if Allan heard no sound when she came to sleep, as she usually did, in the adjoining dressing room. In truth Allan was not sorry to have her holiday all"], [199, "The Plot Thickens. 195 to herself, and to dispose so easily and securely of her troublesome little mistress, who was making a fuss about her head just to spite her poor ma when she came home, Allan was certain. If Allan had known it, Prissy had experienced a very bad quarter of an hour after she had stooped to make believe her head was so bad, and had gone to bed. To have one's clothes taken off was not only an innocent-looking proceeding, it struck Prissy for the first time that it was quite a solemn action, and she recollected with a shiver that she had heard sleep compared to death, and our beds to our graves. Then she had to go through the form of appearing to say her prayers before Allan, Avhich was impious, and made Prissy feel as if she never dared pray again, far less ask a blessing on her intended flight. Prissy Avas tolerably well read for her years, and she was ac- quainted Avith a good deal of Shakespeare, through her father's partiality for the king of dramatists. She knew how Macbeth had cried out piteously while he was fresh from his hideous crime, that Macbeth would sleep no more ; he had murdered sleep when he slew Duncan. He could not say \" Amen \" when others prayed; the \"Amen\" stuck in his throat. Was this happening to her in a small way, as befitted her age and silliness ? Had Prissy also murdered harmless, benignant sleep, and reverent, trustful prayer ?"], [200, "196 Vashti Savage. Then Ben went out for a short time, and returned to leave word that he was going across to his tutor's, to remain over the night, which was his occasional practice. As Ben made this announcement there did flash into his mind the remark Raby had uttered, about not being able to look his Aunt Grace in the face after he had done such a sneaking thing as let Swift play Avith him on the sly. Mrs. Swift had thought Raby's morals not good enough to rub against Ben's. Perhaps she would liA-e to find out her mistake. Because Mr. Swift had his wife to attend to and entertain, and Prissy was too young and delicate to run about, though not to run away, Ben had been thrown a good deal lately into the society of the younger groom and the keeper's assistant. Without Avishing to disparage these well-enough intentioned young men, it must be said Ben's standard of honour had not risen since he had been left to such company. Oh, Ben, what were you all coming to ? There was nobody at home to whom Ben was exactly responsible this afternoon. Still, Allan, not being en tirely destitute of sense and trustworthiness, remon strated with him a little on his announcement, though she had no suspicion of the truth. \" Do master agree to your stopping as the fancy takes you at the Reverend Clarke's, when Mr. Swift is from home, for instance, and^you are the only master"], [201, "The Plot Thickens. 197 Ave have to-night, Master Ben ? If the house should be broken into there is none to have in Wilson and Spiers to help Brisbane in his pantry, and general them all, but you, sir,\" she added coaxingly, and with some tact. \"Don't talk rubbish, Allan!\" said Ben snappishly. \"As to what my father agrees or does not agree to my doing, I take it I'm the best judge of that.\" It was Vashti's misfortune not yet to be capable of arriere-pensees ; yet Roger Swift had been her bene factor throughout, and in return she was robbing him of his children. In the meantime Vashti Avas making cook more and more her cat's-paw. Cook was a weak woman, a widow with children, from whom she was inevitably separated, and after whom she was constantly hanker ing, without rhyme or reason. Vashti professed a strong fello\\A--feeling, and the deepest interest in Mirander and WiU'am, Violettar, Chris'opher and Tummas. She emphasised her interest by an urgent entreaty to cook to wink just once at Vashti's slipping out a-walking as far as Wood Basset, where she had tidings that her Uncle Wisdom had been seen ; and if she could get speech of him he would tell her about her poor dear father and mother, as had lost her nigh a year since, and were, she would go bail, mourning their hearts out for her loss. Vashti had, of course, no"], [202, "198 Vashti Savage. intention of returning from this improvised errand to the next village ; but she was cunning enough to fore see that, if she did not come back, cook Avould be too frightened at Avhat she had already done not to hush up Vashti's absence, and wait a night before she pub lished the circumstances, together with her share in it. The servants sat long over their tea that afternoon, and during their meal Prissy crept out of bed, and huddled on her walking-dress. Ben met her at the door of her room, and the pair stole out of one of the French Avindows of the drawing-room which opened on the lawn. That the brother and sister skirted, so as not to come within range of any of the windows. In the old summer-house, Avhich had already been a frequent rendezvous, Vashti joined the two others, and inflicted a considerable surprise on them by dis playing with much pride and satisfaction a long calico bag or wallet, like a small sack, full of what she called \" perwisions,\" which she had contrived to crib from the pantries. \" You should not have done that, Vashti,\" said Ben, with outraged dignity. \"We have no right to carry away what belongs to my father. My sister has enough money to pay our way, like honest travellers.\" \" And.Avhere did she get the money from ? And were it given her to spend on the road ? \" demanded Vashti, sharp as a needle. \" But if you like I'se run back"], [203, "IN THE OLD SUMMER-HOUSE VASHTI JOINED THE TWO OTHERS.'"], [204, ""], [205, "The Plot Thickens. 201 and sling down a shilling on the pantry floor to pay for our wittles.

Then the little company started at last, with beating hearts, and gained the high-road by a side-walk, ter minating in a gate, which stood unlocked till nightfall, but where there was neither a lodge nor a Mrs. Rust to pounce out from it."], [206, "CHAPTER XI.

Amateur farmers and gardeners, lovers of the outer world of all kinds and degrees, had been basking in the spring sunshine, and making believe everything was to go smoothly now that summer was at the door, while they were busy among the early wheat, the sprouting pasture, the last of the crocuses, the first of the daffodils and Avallflowers. It Avas getting a little chilly in the dusk, though the young blackbirds, taken in by the deceitful promise of the young year, were still piping their flute-like notes, and adding to what was sensuous, alluring, and beguiling in the season. Ben and Vashti had retained their wits sufficiently to see that Prissy wore her warm ulster and sealskin cap, and Vashti had squeezed in among the \"perwisions\" Prissy's small eider-down quilt, and a change of frocks for her in case of showers."], [207, "A Night Adrift. 203 As for Ben, he had a knapsack, which he had got for a short walking tour he had taken with his father before the advent of Mrs. Swift. The knapsack was strapped across Ben's shoulders ; and in it he carried a map of the county Avhich his father had given him ; a pocket compass, that had been a school prize, which he could not use ; a small net for the first moths and butter flies ; a flask of water ; a brush and comb, his and Prissy's toothbrushes, and their nightdresses, when they got quarters for the night; a couple of towels ; a few pocket-handkerchiefs; also a Bible and Prayer book, taken at Prissy's suggestion, lest they should stay on the Plain over the Sunday, and that they might read the morning and evening psalms, though the psalms were in danger of sticking in their throats, like Prissy's prayers. To-day Avas Friday, as Vashti remembered with mingled regret and dread. Ben had his overcoat strapped along with the knap sack; but, after some hesitation and certain sidelong glances at Vashti's load, he offered, his colour rising while he spoke, to take turn and turn Avith her in carrying it. Vashti laughed him to scorn, and capered on Avith the long bag as if it were no more than a feather's weight. She Avas a queer figure in her Sunday's suit, Avhich she had contrived to put on, to do honour to Miss Prissy and Master Ben. It was a set of garments got under Mrs. Swift's regime, and was"], [208, "Vashti Savage. 204 not so much like a small servant's dress as the costume of a charity school. An uncompromisingly plain and sober dark stuff gOAvn, Avith a cape of the same material, and such a long-fronted cottage-bonnet as did the lady who had procured it some credit, for having been able to unearth it in the latter end of the nineteenth century. This telescope of a bonnet was \" strapped \" down on Vashti's head and tied under her chin with a sombre dark blue riband ; at the end of the telescope appeared Vashti's brown face, with the nose turned up instead of down, the eyes looking into each other at an acute angle, the mouth grinning and showing the strong teeth, two of which had been split in Vashti's unconquerable habit of cracking nuts like a squirrel. To the other peculiarities was now added the long, well-stuffed bag round her neck. \" I wish you had not brought that bag, Vashti,\" said Ben discontentedly, \" or Avould let me take it for you in some other fashion. You make us look ridiculous \u2014 like \u2014 like tramps who are carrying off the scraps of their last meal, and the blankets they slept under last night. Everybody that passes us will stare at us, and the police will Avant to take us up. You don't consider that our policy is to avoid observation.\" She did not listen to him till he had finished ; she was giggling. \" I didn't knoAV that you went for to read the course of the stars, Master Ben, or to handle"], [209, "A Night Adrift. 205 the cards. You ha' told what is in my bag as pat as though you were a gipsy. You might ha' learnt the art from Uncle Wisdom's sen. I do ha' Avhat you and Miss Prissy left from your dinner to-day o' the pair o' fowls and the ham and the jam tart ; an' I ha' a loaf, and a half o' a cheese, and what tea and sugar I could claw together. More'n that, I ha' in this here poke the down quilt Miss Prissy slept under last night.\" \" But why did you take all these things? We did not bid you,\" again remonstrated the improvident couple. \" ' Cause I knowed them would be uncommon ooseful, and pretty certain to be wanted afore we got to Lon'on,\" ansAvered Vashti, with an undaunted, impenitent nod. \" What were you two to do for your suppers this night if us does not go farther than I expect we'se go ? We munna enter a house till nobody knows you, Master Ben, or has a guess who Miss Prissy may be, or spots me by some o' my gang.

I borrered madam the hen's quilt, as is the same colour as Miss Prissy's. I smoothed down the bed, and laid in it a piller"], [210, "206 Vashti Savage. wrapped in Miss Prissy's dressing-gown, Avhich were her image, same as two peas, like the woman in the Bible did when her man were fleeing for his life.\" \" The idea of Vashti playing the part of Michal ! \" said Ben, drawing a long breath. \" And me of King David ! \" said Prissy, draAving another. They were both carried away by the excitement of the moment and the beauty of the soft, misty close of a sweet spring day. They had not been out of the grounds together at such an hour for a long time. They had never before been engaged in such an adventure, or indeed in anything deserving the name of an adventure. They were so affected by the strangeness of the situation that even to Prissy it seemed as if she could neA'er feel cold or tired again. She began to make little jokes on the propriety of the party's having satchels or scrips if they were either pilgrims or dwellers among the shepherds in Arcady, and to wonder if Vashti's wallet would represent a general scrip. They had avoided the village, and taken the most unfrequented route. They passed no one except some labourers of the type of Jonathan Back returning from their day's work. These were too phlegmatic to pay much attention to the odd group, or, if they recognised any of the three, to scent mischief, and try to stop it."], [211, "A Night Adrift. 207 It was still light enough for Prissy to hail the first plant of primroses, though the closed-up celandine and anemones could hardly be distinguished as the by path cut through a corner of a coppice. The primroses seemed to greet her like humble, disinterested friends ; yet how white and pure they looked when the early rays of the young moon fell upon them. Prissy had read somewhere that they were like pale widows weep ing to the moon. She had eagerly plucked the first she came upon ; but she felt as if she could not gather any more, as if it was desecration to take them from their lowly bed, where they looked so lovely and so sad, and to crumple and soil them in her hot, trembling fingers. While the spell and charm of the time was still about them, before Prissy began to droop and lag behind, Vashti proposed that they should scramble through a gap in a fence. Her peering, piercing eyes had detected beyond it a dry ditch ; a few paces farther on it ran down betAveen two tolerably high banks, Avhich would shelter the travellers effectually from any wind that was blowing, and from the chance of their being seen from the path they had just quitted. Vashti's idea was that they should sit down and rest here, re freshing themselves by having tea. At first Prissy was of the mind to push feverishly on while her strength lasted, and did not believe that she"], [212, "208 Vashti Savage. could swallow a morsel to restore her powers. But when Ben at a covert signal from Vashti advocated the halt and the tea also, Prissy was not going to prevent the others from making themseh'es comfortable ; after all, a seat was not to be despised, though it was formed of nothing more luxurious than the eccentric curves and twists of an elm tree root. Then there was good fun in seeing her companions, even though she could not help, seeking about for materials with which to make a fire, and piling up dry leaves and twigs. To Vashti's horror she discovered that she had forgotten to bring a box of lucifer matches, and it was doubtful for a minute or two whether Ben's little case of vestas would not be exhausted before a stick could be got to kindle. Prissy and Ben too wished, as something more appropriate, for a couple of flints and the old skill to strike them, which it seemed the very gipsies had lost. At last there was a spark of light among the smoke, and tiny tongues of flame in addition to the general crackling. By judicious blowing and fanning there was soon a blaze, on which Vashti could boil a little kettle she had disengaged from her bag and filled with the water in Ben's flask, which could be easily replenished. The kettle was to be kettle and teapot in one ; a milk jug was not needed, as there was no milk. There were no plates, and only one knife \u2014 Ben's pocket-knife"], [213, "A Night Adrift. 209 \u2014 with which to cut the loaf and dig into the cheese. There Avas but one cup, without a handle. It was presented to Prissy first, and then Ben handed it to Vashti ; but she put her hands behind her back and would not touch it ; she even threatened not to have bite or sup if she were not suffered to look on, serve Miss Prissy and Master Ben while they were eating, and take what they left. She treated them in a sense as her guests, and was more respectful to them in the dry ditch than in their father's fine house. It might be a lingering remnant of the finer manners of the tent, derived from pastoral and patriarchal wanderers in the remote ages of antiquity. If Vashti had forgotten matches, she had not for gotten pinches of sugar \u2014 and salt, too, as she bnasted, when the carcases of the fowls should be in request. She apologised volubly for not having found a tin of Swiss milk to carry away ; but promised vaguely, with an ambiguity which her companions thought it best not to attempt to penetrate, that she would get milk and cream also for them whenever they passed near a farm house dairy, or if they came to a field in which the cows were already out at pasture. The Swifts had occasionally taken part in gipsy teas in their boat on the Mere ; or in the carriage, when it was stopped for the purpose, in the course of a long drive ; but that was play. This was a real gipsy tea, and 14"], [214, "Vashti Savage. 210 they had earned their right to relish it by an unheard-of walk for Prissy. She was stiff and tired when she got up, and it was so dark that she had nearly had a bad fall ; but Vashti insisted that Prissy was dazzled by the gloAV of the fire, and that when they got away from the overhanging banks she would get accustomed to the dusk, and would soon see quite well in it. In the meantime Ben and Vashti came one on each side of Prissy, supported her tottering feet, and drew her on till they were all back in the road. Then certainly Prissy saw that the stars had come out in the sky, and were keeping the moon company, and she could dimly distinguish where she was going, so as to make her way. Only the stiffness did not diminish, and began to be attended with recurring sensations of faintness, against which Prissy struggled desperately. The fact was the girl was reeling with fatigue, to which she was altogether unaccustomed ; but she had a sufficient amount of will to drag herself on in the strength of that gipsy tea for another mile or so, when it was plain to the most unAvilling and dismayed eyes she could go no farther that night. A mist was constantly gathering before her sight ; there was a perpetual humming in her ears. The ulster Avhich, in ordinary circumstances, Avould have been no more than a desirable protection from the chill of even ing, dragged her down as if it had been a coat of mail,"], [215, "A Night Adrift. 211 while beneath its soft folds she was bathed in perspira tion. The party stood still to consider what had better be done ; while Prissy, who would have sunk down otherwise, Avas propped up on a large stone. They were still not more than four miles from Water Basset, and at least as much from the outskirts of the Plain. Vashti thought she could take Miss Prissy on her back ; but, looking at the bag with which she was already laden, nobody else thought so. Her other suggestion, that she and Master Ben should carry Miss Prissy alternately, Avas also allowed to fall to the ground. Then Vashti, who, acting on her previous experience in wandering, had constituted herself the guide of the party, wondered if another meal \u2014 an early supper \u2014 would do any good. Prissy sickened at the mention of it. She took more kindly to Vashti's next proposal, that they should just turn in for the night where they were, to be up by break of day. Perhaps it was a pity they had not stopped when they took tea, or at a commo- dious quarry they had left behind them ; but she would look about for a sheltered spot, and she daresayed they would soon find a tree or a bit of a Avail which would give them some protection. She would wrap Miss Prissy in her quilt, and Master Ben would have his own coat, while she would turn the skirt of her frock over her head and sleep like a top. At the same"], [216, "Vashti Savage. 212 time she would keep an ear open, and hear every sound, every bark of a dog, or chirp of a bird, how ever remote, and see that nothing came near them. \"Oh! yes, Vashti,\" sighed Prissy, \"and you'll do your best to send away the earwigs and slugs, and mice and moles. But Ben and I must not have every thing and you nothing ; you must take my ulster if I have my quilt.\" \" Lozes ! Miss Prissy, I doesn't want nowt,\" pro tested Vashti. \" Do'ee think now I were wont to sleep in the fields thickly clad as I be to-day ? Why, I would ha' on a rag o' frock wi' holes all over me.\" But Ben had not bargained for his delicate little sister spending a night \u2014 the first night too \u2014 in the open air in the month of March. He did not think he would have minded the venture for himself to begin with ; he would decidedly have liked it, and entertained no apprehension of bad consequences ; but he felt such an exposure for Prissy might be as much as the flickering, tenderly cherished life was worth. He dared not incur the risk for her and meet his father's re proaches afterAvards. He was not Avithout a sense of responsibility, however little he had shown himself fit for it ; and he was very fond of Prissy in his incon siderate, boyish Avay. \" No, no ; that won't do. Prissy has got money to pay for a lodging, and a lodging she shall have, how-"], [217, "A Night Adrift 213 ever you and I may have to rough it. I am surprised, Vashti, that you can be so silly and stupid as ever to imagine anything else,\" he stormed a little. \"Oh ! don't send me away by myself; don't put me among strangers ! They will be worse than mice and moles ! \" cried Prissy imploringly, more appalled by the vision of loneliness in a crowd than by anything else, and recoiling Avith all her old aA-ersion from new faces, critical eyes, and scoffing tongues. \"What can I do?\" remonstrated poor Vashti. \"Cottages don't grow like them leaves on the tree. There bean't no village between this and the Plain. If there were, and you and she and me were to go in and ax quarters, us ain't so far from home that somebody wouldn't know us in a trice. We be all under age, and I'se a suspicious character for one. They Avould have it that I Avere a-stealing of you, as if you was babbies, though you are as old, Master Ben, and far bigger than I be. Them would have it I had bewitched you, and were a-decoying of you to join our tribe.\" It Avas true enough, though the road was not that which Ben traversed every day in order to go to his tutor's. It Avas rather out the way of the ordinary Water Basset traffic, and of the goings and comings from the great house, but it was not so obscure as could have been wished. It was in another parish, and was somewhat disused, since it led to noAvhere in"], [218, "Vashti Savage 214 particular save the Plain ; but Ben had traversed it occasionally in following the hunt. It was hardly possible that the three \u2014 each figure conspicuous in its different Avay \u2014 could enter into one of the sprinkling of Avayside houses, in which lights were burning cheer fully, without proA'oking questions which, whether they were parried or not, would speedily lead to the identi fication of the party. \" I never thought it Avas so inconvenient and trouble some to travel incognito,\" complained Ben in disgust. The dilemma ended in Vashti's being authorised to go forward and reconnoitre in the gathering darkness, while Ben kept Avatch over Prissy. \" You ain't downhearted, Priss ; you ain't sorry you have come ? \" Ben pressed his sister anxiously. \" Not exactly sorry,\" said Prissy hesitatingly ; \" but oh ! Ben, I'm too tired to care about anything.\" Vashti returned in a shorter time than could have been looked for, and she brought good tidings. She had discovered a cottage a little way off the road, Avhich she was sure had' not been there the last time she passed in her father's van. She had ascertained it Avas a new cottage occupied by new people. It had been built by one of the men who Avorked at the large stone quarry at this end of the Plain. He was just married, and had come there with his Avife a week or two before. Vashti knew all about them ; for when she had made"], [219, "A Night Adrift. 215 out they were strangers, lately settled in the neighbour hood, she had knocked at the door, and spoken to them boldly. They had a spare room, and had no objection to letting it for the night. The difficulty was how to get Prissy, in the state of exhaustion into Avhich she had sunk, as far as this cottage. This was finally accomplished by Vashti relinquishing her bag for a time, and by her and Ben grasping each other's Avrists, and making what is called the king's cushion. The weary Prissy dragged herself up on this extemporised seat by a great effort, and, with an arm clasped tightly round each of her bearers' necks, Avas borne to her destination. Happily she was no great weight, so that she was not perforce dropped on the road ; but the strain was so great as to prevent either her or Ben from realising the comical element in the little procession. Even Vashti failed to see it ; she was so full of triumph at the success of her mission. When he had deposited Prissy in the strange doorway, Ben ran back and lugged the bag to their temporary quarters. Luggage is commonly regarded as a testi- mony to the respectability of the bond side traveller ; still it may be doubted whether Vashti's \" traps \" contributed to this result. It was fortunate that the stalwart quarry man, Job Vallis, and his rosy-cheeked wife, Hannah, were a simple-minded young couple, who Avere not at this date of their history disposed to suspect evil of"], [220, "216 Vashti Savage. everybody who approached them Avithout full credentials, and with a few puzzling details in their general aspect. The husband and wife Avere waiting Avith considerable interest to see these guests emerge from the darkness. This interest, with the pair's entire acquiescence in Vashti's arrangements, could only be explained by a floAving account she had given, Avhich she did not see it necessary to repeat to the Swifts, of the reason for the association of the three, and for their being benighted, and in great want of a night's lodging. The two whom she had left behind were brother and sister, as anybody might easily guess, though the brother was as straight as an oak sapling, and the sister as crooked as a crooked pin. The}' had just lost their father and mother, with whom Vashti had been in service. \" Murnings \" \u2014 did her audience remark their absence ? They had not got time to provide themselves with \" murnings \" yet ; but they Avould get that and all else in Lon'on, to which they were travelling in order to join a friend. They were bound for Snarestoke station, and had thought it better to walk, as it was fine spring weather, though missy as kept the purse had a tidy bit of money for their use, besides what was laid by in the savings bank. But they had miscalculated missy's strength, and had been like to come to grief. Their name ? Oh ! their name was White, and hers was Black \u2014 weren't it funny for White and Black to go"], [221, "A Night Adrift. 217 together ? And they would be real grateful, and would pay liberal for quiet quarters for the night.\" \" Don't mention no names,\" was the sole crumb of this farrago which Vashti found it advisable to com municate to Ben and Prissy, and the caution sounded only reasonable considering their errand. Prissy was so dead tired that she was only too glad to creep at once to the little bedroom and the bed, which was clean if it was hard. She had not closed her eyes the preA'ious night, and she soon slept heaA'ily. Vashti and Ben tarried below stairs to have their share of the cold fat bacon, home-baked bread, and some cider which the husband and wife were disposing of for their supper, for which the strangers were to \"pay liberal.\" They were fain to reserve their private stores for a time of greater need. Afterwards Ben was accom modated with a strip of carpet and a settle in the kitchen, and the knight-errant was forced to admit to himself that it was a someAvhat uneasy bed. Vashti curled herself up on the floor of the room Miss Prissy occupied, and felt a little grieved surprise that the attitude and the absence of all encumbrances, as she had formerly found them, did not confer on her the delicious sense of freedom she had anticipated. \" I'se be growing a fine lady,\" Vashti told herself, with sorrow and shamefacedness. \" I'se being corrupted from the customs of the gipsy race.\""], [222, "Vashti Savage. 218 The sooner the runaAvays started again the better for their purpose, since they were not more than five miles from Water Basset. When it grew light Ben Avas shocked to find how familiar he was with all the landmarks, though it seemed to him as if years had passed between yesterday and this morning. Not withstanding his feelings, within an hour or two Mr. and Mrs. SAvift would be at home again, and before then Allan must have made the alarming discovery that Miss Prissy Avas gone, not to be seen ; cook would be forced to own what she knew of Vashti's having levanted likewise ; and if the scared servants sent over to the Reverend Oliver Clarke's vicarage to learn if Prissy or Ben had slept there, as the boy had given out, his absence too would be public property. Prissy, though she looked terribly jaded, Avas re freshed by her night's rest ; and, noAV that the rubicon was crossed, had no thought but to go on and carry out her project. Yet it could only be done by her attempt ing to walk five more miles, when four had already been too many for her. She and her companions must at least get as far as the wide Plain, where they might all be hid in the obscurity of the shepherds' huts till the wayfarers could make their way by degrees to the station. It did not occur even to Ben that before then their father might have circulated such information as would lead to the party's being detained at Snarestoke,"], [223, "A Night Adrift. 219 just as they had calculated on being kept back at Water Basset. Fortune favours the bold, or it whisks them on to the quagmire, from Avhich it is hard for them to ex- tricate themselves. Ben, peeping out the first thing in the morning, saw his host of the previous evening bring a pony from a shed and harness it to a rough tax-cart. On making an alarmed inquiry \u2014 for con- science converts us all into cowards \u2014 he found that Job Vallis and se\\-eral more of the quarrymen lived at such a distance from their place of work \u2014 the quarry being at least three miles from the edge of the Plain \u2014 that the men had clubbed together and set up among them the pony and cart to take them to the quarry. Job was the farthest off, and had the first of the cart and pony. As he drove along he picked up his mates one after another, and ended by landing as good as half a dozen working-men at their destination, bringing them back at night in the same fashion. During the day the pony Avas tethered ; and found its \" keep \" on the no-man's grass of that bit of the Plain, till the creature's services were again put in requisition. Ben must haA'e pricked up his ears, and with Prissy on his mind, looked longingly at the rude conveyance while he listened to this explanation. For Job, who Avas a good-natured bumpkin, offered sheepishly to give up his seat ; and he knew a mate of his who he was"], [224, "Vashti Savage 220 sure would do the same ; and they would walk o\\-er to their work for one morning : thus enabling the two young maids and Ben to get a lift in the cart, and be put on their way and set down on the Plain within half a mile of Snarestoke. \" Oh, a thousand thanks, sir ! \" cried Ben delightedly, taking the man's breath away, not only by the extent of his gratitude, but by the polite phraseology in which he expressed it. \" It is not for myself,\" represented Ben, speaking loftily in his roused manliness. \" I could manage it easily though it were twice as far, and so I believe could Vash one of the girls ; but it is for the other \u2014 my poor little sister \u2014 that it will be such an immense boon.\" \" Ay, ay, her's a clean hunchback, and by her face not long for this world,\" said the man coolly, causing Ben to wince doubly in every nerve. Even Vashti was relie\\'ed, Avhile Prissy caught at the respite. Job Avould not trust his and his mates' pony to Ben, as the latter wished, but drove till he picked up the first man to take the reins from him. It was not A'ery pleasant to be rattled along a rough road among four strange quarrymen, compared to whom Job was like an old friend. The seats on which Prissy and Vashti poised themselves were deal boards. Ben stood Avith his hands in his pockets balancing himself among the"], [225, "A Night Adrift. 221 men, who all stared hard at the unexpected addition to their company. When the owners of the cart had become accustomed to the interlopers, they began to chaff them, especially Vashti on her bag. To Prissy's horror, and a little to Ben's discomfiture, Vashti took up the chaff, and proceeded to return it in her mixture of patois and gibberish, accompanying her remarks with bursts of shrill, derisive laughter. \" Her be of a gipsy breed, I'll be sworn,\" Prissy heard one of the men say to another. \" What do the other gal and the boy be ? They're a main queer unchancy-looking lot. Seems that two on them might be changelings. I wonder Job- had aught to do with them.\" \" Like Job's soft headpiece,\" said the man addressed, speaking succinctly and sarcastically."], [226, "CHAPTER XII A STRAIT FOUND MRS. SWIFT'S VERDICT. IT struck Prissy as they drove along, when she could spare attention from the horrible aching of her bones, that the weather was much colder. A grey pall covered the sky ; the air was nippingly keen. She kept shivering under her ulster. Instead of the budding springtide, the fast-approaching summer of yesterday, the world was back into winter, when a blazing fire and closely drawn curtains would be the greatest comfort. There was something dank, heavy, and depressing in the chill atmo sphere, in total contrast to the balminess of yesterday ; but though both Ben and Vashti must have been con scious of it, apparently neither cared to remark upon it. Prissy felt the change in the weather more sensitively still when the quarrymen, pulling up, put down her and her companions on the Plain ; and shouting a direction or two, half in idle horseplay, half in friendly earnest, drove off, end soon dwindled to a speck on the"], [227, "Strait. 223 immediate horizon. This boundless hillocky expanse of blue-green, whitish grass, and sand, under the lowering grey sky, with the wind Avhistling through the bents \u2014 was there ever anything so bleak and dreary ? Where were the cowslips and the orchises, the very furze and gorse ? The bumble-bees had all retreated to their holes. The blue butterflies and crimson and brown moths Avould not put in an appearance for months to come. Ben thought of his butterfly-net packed up with his compass and his map, remembered, too late, that every swallow does not make a summer, and whistled. Vashti glanced sharply in Master Ben and Miss Prissy's faces, and looked foolish for once. This Arcady ! this like Don Quixote's La Mancha ! Why, they had been veritable Don Quixotes to walk into the trap. There were not any sheep to be seen, though thousands fed on the Plain ; and the shepherds \u2014 if there were shepherds, for they and their habitations were alike invisible \u2014 must be the most forlorn and uncouth of men, con demned to dwell in this wilderness, leading lives of isolation and hardship. It was disappointing ; but no great harm had been done after all. The de'sillusionnemeut with regard to the Plain would only send them straight to the station, where they would take the first train to London, and drive direct to Aunt Alicia's. \"Would her father be there before her ; come in search of her ? \" Prissy"], [228, "Vashti Savage. 224 reflected, with a quick throb of her heart. \" Would he set out the moment he arrived at home and found her and Ben gone ? Would he be at Kew ere the day closed, and so thankful to see her arrive that he would instantly laugh and forgive her for having taken the law into her own hands, as he had been wont to excuse her impatient outbursts and rebellious fits ? \" She was recalled with a start to the present by hearing Ben speak. He had evidently quarrelled with the Plain as she had done, though when they were a few years older they might both rise to a comprehension of the sombre grandeur to be found in its vast mono tony and unchanging desolation. \" Come along, Vashti,\" Ben was saying crossly, it must be confessed. \" Let us make for the station. Perhaps there will be a good fire in the waiting-room, and we'll have time to get well warmed before we start. To think we're hankering after a fire now, and re member how jolly the sun was shining and the birds singing only yesterday ! I wonder if there is a re markable fall in the barometer, or if it is the high latitude of this horrible Plain which has wrought the change ? \" \"All right, Master Ben,\" said Vashti hastily. \" The wind will be veering round, and we'll have the sun out again in no time.\" But when they had walked for fully three-quarters"], [229, "A Strait. 225 of an hour \u2014 uneven walking, very trying for Prissy, along a mere sheep-track \u2014 and neither sun nor station appeared, it looked a good deal more like all wrong than all right. Ben turned upon Vashti and cross questioned her. He found that her millions of times of camping out on the Plain dAvindled down to once or twice. She was further forced to admit that when she had come on it, years before, it had been at a different point altogether. The truth was, the way which the quarrymen had taken had completely unsettled the not very clear or fixed bearings which, if she had not been gipsy born and bred, she would not have retained at all in her memory. Ben was inclined to reproach her bitterly, and Vashti Avas growing sullen under his reproaches. But Prissy came in between as a peacemaker ; she could not bear to think of a quarrel. Poor Vashti had constituted herself a beast of burden for the sake of her and Ben ; she had wished to give up everything to them ; had lain grovelling on the floor beside her the previous night (though, to be sure, that was Vashti's natural mode of taking her rest) ; and had wished to carry her, Prissy, on Vashti's back \u2014 though the one girl was not so much bigger than the other \u2014 when she had broken down the previous night. \" Oh, dear ! \" cried Prissy, \" don't you think it would be much better to say no more about what must have been a mistake ? The men said we were not far 15"], [230, "Vashti Savage. 226 from the station ; if we walk on while we are able we must reach it before long.\" Ben acquiesced, so far as holding his tongue and plodding on went. He even made no opposition when Vashti, after another spell of fruitless walking, mildly represented \u2014 considerably subdued as she was \u2014 the advisability of taking luncheon, or dinner, or whatever they liked to call it, while they rested for ten minutes, to save Miss Prissy from dropping at their feet. At least no one could deny that the Plain was a magnificent dining-table, and the diners wanted no tree or bank to shade them, for the leaden clouds supplied sufficient shade. The remains of the fowls, ham, and tart set out on the grass looked more appetising than Prissy could have believed possible, though there was only Ben's knife to carve with, and the guests had to help themselves with their fingers. But when she began to eat she found her thirst so far outstripped her hunger, that she had the greatest difficulty to resist appropriating to her share the whole of the water in Ben's flask, which Job's Hannah had refilled, while she was fain to hide the food among the grass, to be saved the trouble of eating it, and to conceal from the others that she had only swallowed a few morsels. The dinner was not nearly so merry a party as the tea had been ; still Ben and Vashti, in helping each"], [231, "A Strait. 227 other and Prissy and satisfying their hunger, unbent in their stiffness and manner, relinquished their hostile attitude, and became reconciled, to Prissy's great comfort. Vashti was thriftily picking up the fragments of the feast, and depositing them in her half-empty bag, and Ben was pulling up Prissy until she stood dizzily on her feet, when she said quickly, \" What is that ? \" Something Avhite, which was not thistle-down, floated past her on the wind, and \\\\ras followed by another and another morsel of the same kind. \" It do be goose feathers,\" asserted Vashti roundly. But there Avas a quaver in her voice, and the face at the end of her cottage bonnet faded from a warm brown to a dirty yellow. \" Us must be coming to a house or to the station. Somebody's been plucking their geese. \" Then that somebody is Jupiter,\" said Ben grimly. \"It is snow beginning to fall. I see now it has been like it for the last hour or two ; but as the season is so far advanced, we can depend upon its being only a passing shower.\" The season advanced ! March had not gone ; and it came back to Ben's mind, while he was fighting gallantly against yielding to what he called in his schoolboy jargon \"a mortal funk,\" that he had heard of heavy falls of snow on the higher ridges of the Plain as late as the end of April or the beginning of May."], [232, "228 Vashti Savage. \" Come along ; it will do no good to stay here,\" cried Ben hurriedly. \" Perhaps we'll get out of it presently.\" He did not say whether he meant the snow or the Plain ; and even Vashti was too frightened to ask him. The whole sky seemed to close in round them, and darken down upon them, while the air was full of the blinding, bewildering flakes. Earlier in the day Prissy had been teased by the particles of sand which the wind drove into her face ; but the pricking sand was nothing to the stinging snow. It did not take many minutes for the youngest and most inexperienced of the band to realise the danger they were in. They had missed their way on the Plain, the merest corner of which was a trackless desert to them. A fall of snow had come on, which in itself was often enough to confuse the hardiest, most weatherwise of the shepherds who were the natives of the locality. In spite of what Ben had said of a passing shower, the snow might last till it was their winding-sheet. Hidden by a drift, not all the hue and cry which an agonised father could raise would serve to trace and find them till the snow melted and disclosed them cold in death. If they gave way to terror, fatigue, and the cold, which seemed every moment more penetrating and benumbing, they were lost long before night came on. Indeed, they began to be incapable of measuring time, as they stumbled"], [233, "A Strait. 229 along, keeping huddled together under the darkening, thickening sky. Was it possible that it could not be far past noon ? Had they not rather been Avandering many hours since they were set down by the quarry men ? Was it not night and not noon that was around them ? It could not be that it was not twenty-four hours since, in their unthinking, undutiful exultation, they had quitted Water Basset, with its opening daffo dils and piping blackbirds. \" Oh, Ben, it is no use ! I cannot do it any longer ! \" cried Prissy in a trembling voice, sinking down in a grotesque, white heap ; for her ulster was as white as the Plain was fast beconing. \" No, no, Prissy ! you must not lie down ; you must get on somehow ! \" urged Ben hoarsely. Again he and Vashti made the king's cushion, and pushed along as best they might with Prissy's feeble arms round their necks and her head resting on Ben's shoulder. Even in that uneasy position she was sleep ing already, and dreaming, as they could hear. \" Is it you, father ? \" she muttered in broken sen tences. \" Have you come for me ? Did Aunt Alicia let you in ? Where is Ben ? \" \" Wake up ! wake up, Prissy ! \" shouted Ben, as if he were losing his senses, bending his face down to hers, in order to feel that, as he feared, her cheeks and fore head were cold as ice."], [234, "Vashti Savage. 230 \" Don't you know that if you sleep like this it will be the death of you ? \" cried Ben again. The next moment she had a rough awakening. His foot plunged into a rabbit's hole, and he fell sprawling on all fours, bringing the two girls down with him in his fall. Vashti was on her feet again in a second, and happily Prissy was not much hurt, while she was effectually roused for the moment. It was poor Ben who had suffered injury. . He had hurt his right ankle badly ; and when he attempted to stand upon it, he could not suppress a groan of pain ; he had to sit down again, with all the hale colour deserting his cheeks and leaving them well-nigh as Avhite as Prissy's. \" You must take her on your back, Vashti, as you offered yesterday,\" he said, after a moment's pause of utter consternation. \" You must leave me here. When you reach the station, or any shepherd's hut, you can send back and fetch me. I'll be still enough, I promise you, till then,\" he said, Avith a tremendous effort at pleasantry. \"No, no, Ben!\" sobbed Prissy; \"I will not leave you, so you need not bid me. We can all lie here and freeze together, if God is going to kill us as a punishment for our running aAvay. Perhaps we deserve it. I don't knoAV. I did not think we were doing what"], [235, "' THE KING'S CUSHION \" (p. 229)"], [236, ""], [237, "A Strait. 233 Avas very wrong at the time ; but the best we can do now is to be very sorry and submit, to God's will. Oh ! but when I think of it, you are not a useless, sickly creature like me. He may mean to save you and give you a deal of work to do for Him, and for poor men and women in this Avorld. I will stay if Vashti will let me have the quilt to cover me up, and help me to think I'm in bed ; and she will carry you on her back \u2014 she is strong enough to do it for a bit. You won't be kept back pulling me along.\" \"I'se carry you both if you'll let me try,\" said Vashti, with pathetic valour. \" I tell you us is near the edge of this here great cheat of a Plain. I seed that big stone as plain as Punch when us were in the cart, not long arter we had turned off the road. Master Ben, Avill you get on my back? and, Miss Prissy, will you hang on to my arm ? and we'se try that for a Avhile. Maybe, please God, we'se get to the fields and hedges again, where, though it be all slush and muck in weather like this'n, there's bound to be horses and carts a-passing as cannot refuse to lend us a lift ; for them will see we're dead beat.\" Ben did what Prissy had only once seen him do before ; and that was when, in a dispute with another boy over a bird they had caught, Ben opened his hand clenched OA'er the captive, and there the little feathered thing lay dead in his grasp. He burst into tears,"], [238, "Vashti Savage. 234 covering his face with his hands to hide the drops which were trickling through his brown fingers. In that moment Ben registered a vow to their Father in heaven, that if He would save Ben's little sister and give her back to her father on earth, from whom Ben had beguiled her \u2014 thus betraying the trust which had been put in him \u2014 then God might take Ben ; and might He and Christ have mercy on the boy's soul. With much pain and mortification Ben hoisted him self on Vashti's back, Vashti swaying under the load, but recovering her footing the next instant and clutching Prissy. She had already dropped her bag, abandoning its crumbs to the crows or to any other hapless way farers after the thaw came. But just as the cavalcade was starting, a shout and the faint, muffled sound of wheels and a horse's feet fell on their greedy ears. It was no vehicle from the station, which remained as much a castle in Spain as ever ; it was the quarrymen's cart, hastily yoked at the dinner hour, and driven back by the man who had reflected on Job Vallis's headpiece. He happened to be a father, and he had been unhappy in his mind ever since the snow came on about these three queer youngsters. As he and his mates had remarked to each other, the boy and girls had not seemed as if they were \" nosing \" the direction of the station when they were last seen by the occupants of the vanishing cart."], [239, "Found. 235 In not so many minutes as it takes to describe the operation, and with a great laugh at their plight, Prissy, Ben, and Vashti were swept rather than handed into the cart, while the man, who had to get back to the quarry in time to bolt his dinner before he returned to work, whipped up his pony, and took his way tc Job Vallis's ; for the condition in which tAvo of the pedes trians Avere found forbade further travelling that day. Worn out and aching in every limb, as eA'en Vashti found herself, the jolting of the cart was elysium con trasted with the prospect which had recently lain before them. Presently they were at Job's, where the stolid wonder and awkward kindness of the young country- Avoman, her kitchen fire, and her clean spare bed were doubly welcome. But Ben wanted more of the cart and pony. He desired to hire them to carry him straight to Water Basset. He had had enough of taking the law into three young pairs of hands, even though it was only to go to Aunt Alicia's. He had made a second vow as he had mounted ignobly on Vashti's back, that if the chance were granted to him he would go \"right off\" to his father, tell him everything, show him where the two girls were to be found, and bear as much of the blame as he could take on himself. He had no Prissy to consult eagerly about making the reparation, and to propose to drive home with him forthwith. To the"], [240, "Vashti Savage. 236 terror of Ben, who was not fit to distinguish between the sleep of deadly stupor and that of exhausted nature, which was only taking the quickest and safest means to recover itself, Prissy was again so fast asleep that he could not rouse her. It was in vain that Hannah and Vashti, even with their limited knowledge, bade him not \"take on,\" but let her be ; she Avas only going on as well as possible, and practising the most sensible behaviour to be followed in the circumstances. She was no longer chill and cold, but getting as warm as a pie between Hannah's fire and all the bedclothes in the house heaped upon her. He could only feel lonely and miserable. He declined to waste time in attending to his sprain, and contrived to infect Hannah and Vashti Avith his sickening apprehensiveness, till the latter submitted without further resistance to the exposure of her numerous ingenious fictions, and the collapse of the whole grand undertaking. But even to hire the cart and horse, which Ben could have driven himself, in spite of the pain of his sprain, over the paltry four miles to Water Basset, was not so simple a matter as he had fancied. The quarryman Avho had come to the rescue reckoned that he had done more than enough when he had brought the party to the safe shelter of Job's. He needed his cart to take him back ; he was not going to trust the beast to the runaway son of Mr. Swift of Water Basset,"], [241, "Found. 237 Avho, according to his own confession, had made a fine mess of it in getting his poor creature of a sister and their gipsy maid, as well as himself, into a bad scrape. Ben chafed and fretted, besought and threatened in vain. It was evening Avhen, writhing between his im patience and the torture of his sprain, and accompanied by the cautious Job, to see that the joint-stock beast came to no harm, Ben started for Water Basset. Night had fallen before the Water Basset carriage returned in the company of the humbler A'ehicle. The carriage brought not only Mr. Swift and the repentant Ben, but Mrs. Swift. Prissy had at last Avoke up perfectly conscious, and was much better, though she was still weak and weary. But she did not even make the attempt to spring into her father's arms, and sob out on his breast her shame and regret for the trouble she had caused him. It was not that she was frightened ; he had been in too great distress about her for the distress not to have swallowed up largely his displeasure against her. He was melted at the sight of her, and inclined, as was his wont, to spare her to the utmost of his power. The truth was she could not take her eyes off Mrs. Swift. Prissy could not have imagined so great a change coming over any human being in so short a time. Mrs. Swift's eyes were red and swollen with sore weeping ; her primly elegant dress was all tumbled"], [242, "238 Vashti Savage. and soiled ; her hands and head were alike shaking. She was quite distrait. She came in with a half-run, and fell on the bed in which Prissy was still lying. \" Oh, my dear ! \" she cried, in tones husky with anguish, \" was it so bad as this comes to ? Did I make you and Ben do this cruel, wicked thing ? Did I nearly cost your father the best beloved of his children ? \" And with that she fainted right away. Prissy was sliding from the bed, Ben was hobbling up, even Vashti was bestirring herself that she might be of use, when they were all arrested by Roger Swift. \" Stand back ! \" he said sternly, almost fiercely, while he raised his wife in his arms. \" Leave her to me. You are none of you worthy to touch the best and kindest woman in the world ; no, not even you, Prissy, who have been cruel and treacherous. I could not have thought it of you.\" They all drew back abashed ; but already Mrs. Swift was recovering, and beckoning them to come forward. \" Give me your hand, Prissy, dear. Oh, how hot and feverish it is ! Poor little hand ! But we'll soon put that right. Benny, my boy, where are you ? You must not stand about on that foot of yours, or the liniment and bandage which I applied when they were putting in the horses \u2014 and you said they relieved you \u2014 will do no good.

Benny has been telling me how you helped him to carry Prissy, and then you tried to drag them both along instead of seeking to save yourself, you brave, faithful girl.

Roger Swift interposed, unable to conceal the emotion which so easily overcame him. \" Sarah, my love, you are over-exerting yourself before you have fairly recovered from your faintness.

They could not stand it. \"She was not at the bottom of our running away, father,\" said Ben. \" We did it out of our own silliness and Avickedness,\" said Prissy. \" We ought to have known better. We were your children ; she was only your servant.\" \" A pretty servant,\" said Mr. Swift scornfully, still disposed to find a scapegoat for his children. \" Roger,\" said his wife, \" be just.

I would not listen to those who had experience, while I had none. I have just had a letter from a great doctor whom I used to know, to whom I wrote in order to consult him about Prissy, and he told me frankly, as he was bound to do, that nurse was right in her plans, and I was in error.

Vashti was not to say kneeling at Mrs. Swift's feet ; she Avas grovelling on the ground before her. \"Oh, dear, you must not do that!\" protested the astonished lady ; \" nobody kneels except to God and to the Oueen.\" \" I be taking your service, Missus Swift,\" said Vashti simply and solemnly. \" I be owning you for my lady and queen.

The tidings that the young people were missing had immediately been carried to the Rectory, and the moment Lady Grace, on returning from town in company Avith her husband, heard what had occurred, she hurried over to the great house to express her own and her husband's sympathy, offer their help, and try to put in a word for the misguided Avrongdoers. \" Of course they are very wrong.

But between you and me, Hugh, I don't altogether Avonder at it. That prim, goody-goody old maid ! What could possess any man in his senses, the father of a large family, to make her his second wife ? Yes, she has money \u2014 I know that ; but very likely it is settled on herself; and I should not have expected an impulsive, emotional man to be so wholly mercenary. How could he expect a high-spirited boy to endure being turned into a tame cat, and a poor deformed child, all nerves and fancies, Avhom he had made his companion and pet, to be compelled to submit to the ordinary schoolroom routine, and be pared and pinched and squared into the ordinary girl's standard, without mischief coming of it ? \" \" Roger Swift is not a man who thinks before he acts,\" said quiet, deliberate Hugh Neville. \" He commits the deed, and then argues the matter out, and"], [248, "Vashti Savage. 244 congratulates or condoles with himself, as it may be, after the thing is done. But he has been fortunate hitherto. He has a faculty for falling on his feet.

The most attractive qualities at first sight are not always those that Avear well.\" \"Is that a hit at me, my dear? Didn't you find me exceedingly attractive ? Don't I wear uncommonly well, as well as the Vicar of Wakefield's wife's famous wedding-gown ? \" He could not deny the truth of the challenge ; but he would not give up poor Mrs. Swift. \" As to the story of the gipsy girl's enticing the others,\" Lady Grace proceeded to deliver her opinion, \" I believe that is all bosh and Mrs. Swift's strong prejudice \u2014 the only thing strong about her. I have no doubt it is a case of give a dog a bad name and hang him ; and the poor waif, knowing very well that she would get the blame, has anticipated the sentence passed upon her, and taken herself off in the wake ot the real offenders. I am rather sorry. She was quite an original in my class in the Sunday-school. She Avould come plump out with such odd ideas.

When the Rector and his wife saw the Swifts after the recovery of the truants, Lady Grace heard with her own ears how tear fully the stepmother was rejoicing, how ingenuously she was blaming herself, how ready she was to make herself of no account in order to atone for her natural blunders in seeking to serve others. Lady Grace also discovered how Mrs. Swift had pled for Vashti Savage. The tears came into the younger woman's bright eyes ; she flung her arms impetuously round Mrs. Swift's neck and kissed her. \" My dear Mrs. Swift,\" said Lady Grace, \" we"], [250, "Vashti Savage. 246 should be arrant hypocrites and rank impostors if we let you go on accusing yourself like that, we who are not half so good as you are. These naughty children will be utterly ungrateful and not worth their salt if they ever misunderstand or vex you again. Will you do me the honour of being my friend ? I assure you I'll strive to deserve your friendship. We have been a little long in SAvearing it, but that is no reason why it should be less sincere and lasting.\" From that day the Rectory and the Great House were in close alliance. Lady Grace paid Mrs. Swift affectionate deference and unremitting attention. She took Ben in hand and lectured him confidentially as she lectured her nephew, Raby. She used all her blandishments, with eventual success, to coax Prissy into coming to the Rectory as to another home, into growing up on intimate terms with Gracey, so that by close contact with a girl of her own age and rank she might lose much of her sore shyness and unhappy self-consciousness. Prissy did become much healthier, both in body and mind, though she remained that touching spectacle, a young woman with a sweet, intelligent face and a hunch on her back. Gracey Neville, without brother or sister, came at the last to be almost brought up with the two younger Swifts. Gracey was a tall, graceful girl, not pretty, but, to her mother's secret satisfaction, what she prized"], [251, "Summer Days and Summer Years. 247 a great deal more than prettiness, distinguished-look ing. Happily for Gracey this intangible but very real attribute was balanced by a reflection of her father's genuine humble-mindedness. She was quiet, like him, not vivacious after the pattern of her mother ; but she had inherited from both parents, though it A\\'as restrained in her father and restrained also in Gracey, a keen sense of humour, which was like the silver lining to the soft, cool cloud of her tender thoughtfulness. It rendered her a charming com panion. She Avas in request even with the highest and mightiest of her cousins, as she was not less liked and trusted by the most lowly of her kindred. There was a belief current in the neighbourhood that she had been destined from the beginning for her cousin Raby, and that events were shaping themselves to the desired end. It Avas supposed that Lord and Lady Barton were willing to overlook her inferiority in rank because of the near relationship and the favour in which they held their niece. Raby was understood to be ready to play his part as a principal in the business. The Rector and Lady Grace could have only one feeling in the matter\u2014 satisfaction at having their child elevated to the position from which her mother had descended, which Gracey Avas so well qualified to fill. But common beliefs are not often rigidly accurate,"], [252, "248 Vashti Savage. and are sometimes but the lingering echoes of half developed wishes and light predictions, the source of which has undergone a radical alteration. While there had been nothing save sunshine and prosperous winds where the Swifts' course was dis cerned, a manifest shadow had fallen on the Rectory, which was not likely to be lifted till death sundered the Nevilles' connection with the place. The blow had descended on the Rector ; after years of threatening the sentence was pronounced, and Hugh Neville was stricken blind, with a blindness for which there was no hope, in middle life and for the natural term of his days. Everybody said he bore it admirably, with Christian resignation, and even, after a space, with cheerfulness. He commanded many consolations. His circumstances were easy. He could afford and had secured an excellent curate, while his wife and daughter were worth ten sons to the man whose life was darkened. Lady Grace bore up nearly as Avell as her husband, and would not show the white feather, least of all in his hearing ; but in the entire devotion which she displayed to her \" blind hero,\" as she called him in her own mind, there could hardly be room for the earlier ambitions, which she had cherished, to exist in full force. She might not be sensible of it, but the atmosphere she was destined to breathe for the rest of her married life was calculated to"], [253, "Summer Days and Summer Years. 249 subdue and chasten her, and it would be the worse for Lady Grace if she resisted its gentle influences. She always said that her greatest comfort was Gracey ; whom she could not bear to think of as separated from her father \u2014 indeed, at present, it was difficult to get the girl to consent to such a separation for more than a few weeks at a time. The next greatest comfort was the vicinity of Lady Grace's dear friends, the Swifts. It Avas a matter of distinct congratulation to Lady Grace that her boy, as she would style Ben Swift, was to settle at home. Roger Swift had bought not only the Great House, but a considerable part of the estate of Water Basset, Avhich Ben, who had a taste for agriculture and was fond of a country life, was to manage for his father ; Roger Swift making no secret that in doing so Ben Avould be learning to do the best he could with his future inheritance. This Avas not making an eldest son of him in one sense, for these were not ancestral acres with all their hereditary association, and Roger's fortune was reckoned large enough to render his property at Water Basset a mere slice of it, for which, with the present prospects of agriculture, Ben's elder brothers were not likely to have a special craving. Gradually Vashti Savage had grown, like her com panions, to years of discretion, and as gradually she had laid down her wild habits and lawless instincts,"], [254, "Vashti Savage. 250 with much of her language, half-unformed and childish, half-manufactured of a fine variety of rude, local dialects. Theft had become, if possible, more impossible to her than to a woman who had never stolen. The last lie had burnt the lips which would speak truth thence forth. But if to the gipsy, as to the negro, belongs the quintessence of old-world fidelity, she still showed traces of her descent ; not merely in never swerving from the allegiance she had vowed to Mrs. Swift, but in having absolutely identified herself with the members of the family she had known at Water Basset. Appa rently she could not conceive the possibility of her interests being separated from theirs, or of her repre senting a distinct and different identity. She was like their other goods and chattels. But she made a strong demarcation between Mr. and Mrs. Swift, Ben and Prissy, at home, and the rest of the family scattered abroad. She refused to acknowledge the absentees when they appeared on the scene, and treated them as strangers with whom she had nothing to do, except to be distantly civil to them. Lady Grace was so much edified by Vashti's tactics in this respect that she adopted them as her own, particularly when her brother John and his wife were at the Rectory. Vashti had risen from being scullery maid \u2014 first to be studio maid, when Prissy, developing the artistic tastes which had come to her from her father, and had"], [255, "Summer Days and Summer Years. 251 already appeared in Clara, set up a studio. Clara had delivered it as her verdict that Prissy had really some painting faculty ; and if she followed it up and seriously gave herself to it, as Clara herself had done, by at once quitting Water Basset, putting herself under some competent masters, undergoing a long and close course of study, she might in the end, if she did well and kept her health, attain to Clara's eminence in art. Sht might in half-a-dozen years or so accomplish the feat of painting a picture with a little invention and a good deal of learning in it. She might also \u2014 though this was more doubtful \u2014sell the said picture in half-a-dozen more years. Prissy would not accept art on these terms ; but she had as good masters as Roger Swift could bring to Water Basset to teach her, and sometimes she wondered if any of her drawing-masters, unknown to fame at present, would in another generation turn out to have been an \" old Crome.\" She contented herself with the flowers, birds and beasts, the little bits of cottage interiors, the rustic mills, bridges, and groups of trees, which had such a charm for her ; and into their repre sentation shed something of the charm which was in her own mind. She and Vashti, Ben, her father and mother, Gracey Neville, and, at a little farther distance, Lady Grace, took the utmost pride and pleasure in these performances. When the first of them, offered to an"], [256, "Vashti Savage. 252 exhibition, was accepted, hung, sold, the exultation of those concerned in it knew no bounds, till Prissy half forgot that, like a pilgrim of old, she carried a burden on her back. She was the better able to forget it because she, too, had laid it at the foot of the Cross. Vashti progressed to the full extent of Prissy's service ; she was the young lady's maid \u2014 not that she confined her energies to waiting on Prissy ; she was Mr. and Mrs. Swift and Ben's servant as well. She would watch and run and slave for any of them as a matter of course, whether or not there was any call for her service. Vashti was a queer-looking little body, short and rather broad, swarthy in complexion, with those cross-set eyes of hers. Ben had a friend, a medical student, an enthusiast in his profession, who used to visit at the Great House. This young man got very much in earnest about performing an operation on Vashti's eyes, cutting the nerves that held them in bondage, which, when severed, would enable her to look the world straight in the face. He infected Ben with his zeal ; but Vashti would not hear of it, unless, indeed, to gratify Master Ben. \" My eyes are as God made them, and, if you please, I would rather keep them as they are. Of course if they give any of the family a turn, and you would be happier with them standing even, the gentleman can take them out and put them in again, as you and he"], [257, "Summer Days and Summer Years. 253 like. I daresay I could persuade master and missus and Miss Prissy, if you Avish it A'ery much, Master Ben.\" \" No, thanks, Vashti ; I don't want to overrule the minds of my friends unless in cases of necessity, neither would I take the responsibility of making them beautiful for eA-er against their will. After all, you might not look the same old Vashti, and the old place would not be like itself without you.\" The day Ben took his college degree with honours he hurried home, to be warmly congratulated by the Rector, patted on the back by his father, and kissed, not only by Prissy but by Mrs. Swift and Lad)' Grace. Gracey could not very well have joined in the pleasant greeting to an old playfellow and present friend, but her blushes Avere spared, for, to the disappointment both of herself and Ben, she was from home. Vashti Avould haA'e bobbed a curtsey to him, but at his earnest request gave him a shake of her hand instead. \" Won't you gi\\'e a fellow a shake of the hand on his promotion ? now I call that mean ; \" and Vashti could not resist the appeal. It was a summer evening, and Mrs. Swift was sitting in the garden-chair, which had long been a favourite with her, having the guest of the evening beside her. \" I am afraid I must not call you Benny any more when you have done such great things,\" she said, with a happy smile."], [258, "Vashti Savage. 254 \" Call me anything you like,\" he said ; \" but I've a notion I shall like the old name best, though I own I was not always fond of it.\" \" Weren't you, dear ? \" she asked innocently ; \" I didn't know ; I'm sorry if \" \" Oh no ! never mind. I Avas a stuck-up, saucy beggar, as all boys are. But there is something I should like to say to you, mater,\" he went on, leaning towards her with his arm round the back of the chair, \" something on my mind, on my conscience, which has weighed there a long time. I should like to make a clean breast of it to-night, of all nights, if you don't object.\" \" Of course I don't,\" she ansvA'ered cheerfully. \" I'm certain it can't be very bad.\" \" I don't knoAV that ; it happened an age ago, when Priss and I were still in the gall of bitterness \u2014 two horrid, carping, insubordinate little wretches.\" \"Well ?\" she said, still Avith a smile, for that time was so distant, and everything had so changed, that the remembrance was robbed of its pain. \" I had the intolerable impertinence and bad taste to call you by a name behind your back.\" She flushed a little, but only said, \" Boys will be boys. I expected far too much from \"you ; no doubt I provoked you.\" \" No,\" he said ; \" at least I ought not to have been"], [259, "Summer Days and Summer Years. 255 provoked. I was a self-Avilled sinner, and Prissy was spoilt, with more excuse for it.\" \" If the name was very rude,\" she said, with a little return to the old formal ways, which had lost much of their formality in the interval, \" I think I had rather not hear it, and just take it for granted that you are sorry for it ; though such childish offences \u2014 which you left off long ago, no doubt \u2014 are not worth mentioning.\" \" It was left off from the day you found us at the quarry-man's,\" muttered Ben. \" Then why say anything about it \u2014 on this day especially ? \" \" But it Avas not so bad as that comes to ; at least, I don't think so, though it Avas a great liberty, and I meant it to be withering satire. I called you ' the hen ! ' \" \" Oh, that was not bad at all,\" she said, with a relie\\-ed laugh. \" That almost sounds as if you saw something motherly in me ; but perhaps the name was suggested by my gait or my voice.\" \" No,\" he said ; \" it was your timidity which I pre tended to take off. But think how I was cut to the heart when I had that touch of diphtheria up at Cam bridge last year, and you came and nursed me ; while Priss was with Gracey at the Rectory, and did not know of it. Not even Annie would come near me. She said she had not diagnosed the complaint, and must Avait to do that to be of any service.

How happy I was to find you better, and to bring you back with me as soon as the danger of infection was over ! \" \"It Avas little you minded the danger of infection for yourself, you courageous woman ! \" Ben Avas a very nice young fellow. Naturally he Avas hand and glove with the people at the Rectory, which he had frequented since he Avas a lad, where he had become something like the right-hand man of the blind Rector, Lady Grace, and Gracey. It was a small matter comparatively that he had grown up one of the handsomest young men in the county, and when he rode to hounds there was none in the field to be com pared to him, either in manly beauty of person or in fine horsemanship. Lady Grace, though she neA'er so much as went to a meet now, when she met Ben Swift in his pink coat on his splendid hunter, which had been his father's gift to him on his taking his degree, used to look wistfully after him, or stop and charge him, \" Mind and bring us the news of the hunt, Ben.\" In one way and another Ben was constantly associated with Gracey Neville ; but the little world in Avhich she lived, with which she was a first favourite, could not yet bring itself to modify its grand views for her and"], [261, "Summer Days and Summer Years. 257 for itself, since it would be a feather in Water Basset's cap if the future Earl of Barton, whose father was in the Ministry, took a bride from its Rectory. Lady Grace might be equally blinded by an old unsafe brother-and-sister connection between the pair, though that would not account for the sigh and the smile, the rueful yet resigned shake of the head with which she Avould look after the two, when she had sent them on one of her innumerable errands. \" I had planned another career for Gracey,\" she thought, \"but man proposes and God disposes. I cannot take the child from her father, and Ben is like a dear son to us, far more so than poor Raby, who has not been quite satisfactory lately. Mr. Swift is a rich man. Ben will be the son of his old age, who has never left him. He can hardly do less than make an eldest son of him \u2014 at least, make all the sons equal. Then dear Mrs. Swift's fortune is at her own disposal. She has had A-ery little to do Avith the rest of the family ; it will doubtless go to Ben and Prissy, Avhom she has helped to bring up, of Avhom she is so fond, and poor dear Prissy will neA-er marry. It may all come eventually to Ben. My dear aristocratic-looking Gracey might do worse, for it is very, very different from her becoming the wife of an ordinary small squire. Even then, land is land, whateA-er people may say. Besides, I believe it would break the child's heart to go farther than a 17"], [262, "Vashti Savage. 258 ten minutes' walk from her father. My darling has never disobeyed my wishes hitherto, but I don't know if even they would prevail in this instance.\" It crept like a cold icy touch upon Prissy that somebody, even her dear friend Gracey Neville, was to come between her and Ben, and stand first for ever afterwards. Prissy fought bravely against the green eyed monster jealousy, called him by his right name, denounced him as a mean, ignoble wretch, who would always have the best for himself, who grudged another, grudged even her own Ben his crown of joy, because, in order to form it, a few green leaves and pale blossoms had to be stripped from her thorny crown. But though she Avas resolute to trample the demon under foot, there came upon her sometimes an overwhelming sense of the isolation and slow martyrdom of her indivi dual lot. Manhood's passion and affection, children's duty and tenderness could never enter into it. There must ahvays be wrung out where she was concerned the bitter drops of bodily suffering and humiliation, tainting the whole cup of life till it was shattered, and its contents lost in the great flood of eternity. This sense of crushing deprivation and loss haunted her chiefly when she was alone, and at liberty to indulge her melancholy mood. Thus Vashti found Prissy in her beautiful, luxurious studio, which her father had taken delight in fitting up"], [263, "Summer Days and Summer Years. 259 for her, one winter afternoon after Gracey Neville had run in to pay her friend a visit, and Ben had arrived in time to escort the visitor home. There had been a good deal of bright talk and laughter, which had suddenly sunk into silence. When Vashti entered to ask if her mistress Avould have lights, she saw only in the firelight a crooked shadow on the Avail, and a pitiful little white face pressed against the pane of the window. Prissy had gone there to watch the depar ture of her companions, and was looking at Ben, with Gracey's arm drawn through his, after he had pulled her fur cloak round her with elaborate care. \"Ain't it cold there, Miss Prissy?\" said Vashti tentatively. \" A little,\" said Prissy, with a shivering sigh, moving aAvay from the Avindow and standing on the hearthrug, with her hands loosely clasped together, a hump-backed girl who realised her destiny and rebelled against it. \" But I can fancy that it won't be cold outside,\" making an effort in her utter Aveariness and despondency to express a little of Avhat she felt, and try if that would do her good. \" It Avill only feel bracing in the frosty wind, and the stars will be coming out presently. A brisk walk in pleasant company to stir the blood and send it coursing through the veins, \u2014 it must be good to those who are strong as they are young, Vashti.\" \"Well,\" said Vashti, dubiously, \"it is a roughish"], [264, "260 Vashti Savage. night. The wind will pull you here, and tear you there, and I shouldn't wonder if there be a storm of sleet soon, for it is not right-down frost, there are puddles of water in the road.

You're my dear old Vashti, my best and most faithful of maids. But I am not even sure that I shall have you always. You'll be tempted, you'll leave me too, and I sha'n't be able to blame you.\" \" Now this is too much,\" said Vashti, getting very red, her squinting eyes, as it were, scintillating at each other. \" What have I done that you should mistrust me ? Ain't we bound to each other as mistress and maid, same as if we were man and wife ? \" \" Not quite, as you may find out by-and-bye, without any blame to you.\""], [266, "262 Vashti Savage. \" No, I won't,\" said Vashti doggedly ; \" and I wouldn't, though I'd never set eyes on your face. Do you think I'd go and marry a man to lounder me ? \" \" But every man isn't going to lounder you, as you call it.\" \" Every man could an' he would, and that is more than enough for me. It ain't kind or polite of you, Miss Prissy, to speak as if we could part in life. If I were a clever, good young lady like you, with such a room as this, and such a father and mother as you have, and such a maid as me, I wouldn't go for to under value them, I would think myself very well off indeed. I wouldn't waste a sigh on such follies as sweethearting and marrying, for though you may beat about the bush \u2014 because it is well-bred \u2014 I ain't well-bred, and I know it is that Master Ben is after. Well, ain't he welcome ? though, to my mind, he would have been better not to put hisself into the way of temptation.\" \" Of loundering his wife, do you mean, Vashti ? \" asked Prissy, beginning to laugh. \"Ay, and of more than that, for that ain't much. However, if Master Ben is so silly and soft to himself as to Avish it, don't he deserve to have his wish better than most men ? Sha'n't we be happy to look on and see that he has it, though he has his cares with it, and to think he knows that none is gladder, just because he is glad, than his own sister as he has always cared for ? \""], [267, "Summer Days and Summer Years. 263 \" The friend of the bridegroom rejoices to hear the bridegroom's voice,\" said Prissy softly. \" Yes, Vashti, you are right ; thanks, old friend, for reminding me Avhat is the highest, happiest happiness, to stand aside and see another preferred, and be grateful for the preference. It is so high that, like the air on mountain tops, it is perhaps a little rare and thin to poor selfish mortals in this region of earthly clouds and mists, but it is the highest happiness after all. Men and women can go on in the strength of it for many days, till all earth's trouble vanishes, and there is nothing but eA'erlasting peace.\" \" I don't rightly know what you're talking on,\" said Vashti hastily. She was always shy of approaching serious subjects, or even as a rule of discussing her deeper feelings ; she had put force on herself to say what she had said. \" But as for happiness, ain't you and me to be as happy as the day is long, looking after the master and missus, keeping house together, and taking care of them ? I mean Master Ben and his lady, when he gets her, for they'll want to be taken care of in their troubles.\" Vashti uniformly stuck to the point that she Avould marry no man to be his property. In spite of her gipsy extraction and cross-set eyes, she was not with out her suitors. Spiers, the gardener, feeling years coming upon him, and seeing what \" a tidy lass\" Vashti"], [268, "264 Vashti Savage. had grown into, and in what favour she was held by the family, when he wanted a woman's hand about him, appeared to think that it would only be a fit return for the pains he had taken in showing Vashti how to weed onion beds and hoe potatoes and turnips, if she would accept the vacant post in his family. Will Back, Jonathan and Lizzie Back's son, who had risen so far in the world as to be an under-keeper, had never lost sight of the fact that Vashti Savage, after leading him into mischief by teaching him how to twist the cleverest \" springs \" for hares he had ever seen set up, got him out of the scrape by taking the whole blame on herself, dauntless little wench that she was ! Her brown skin, the very cast in her eyes, and her saucy tongue had possessed a charm for gruff, thick-headed Will from that day. He was willing to risk offending the whole clan of his brothers and their wives \u2014 for Jonathan and Lizzie were long ago gone to their rest, alas ! alas ! ground into their graves with ceaseless, hopeless toil, \u2014 by marrying the old gipsy tramp and work'us gal if she would have him. But to each of her suitors Vashti had the same scorn ful answer. \"Me marry a man, to walk at his heels and be loundered every time I sneeze against his will ! not if I knows it ! What do you take me for ? I ain't such a fool as not to know when I'm well off.\""], [269, "CHAPTER XIV ROGER SWIFT IN THE TOILS THE LION AND THE MOUSE. ROGER SWIFT had never been so rich a man as he was thought to be, though he had been in possession of a large income and had great sums of money passing through his hands. Theoretically he altogether approved of men who not only live within their incomes, but lay by savings Avhich shall render them independent of turns of fortune and mercantile reverses. But he was himself a man Avith whom spending, not saving, is an instinct, and his indolent, self-indulgent nature, with all its latent vigour and spasmodic energy, hindered his going against his instincts. Saving, like retrenching with another class of men, was always put off till to-morrow \u2014 a to-morrow which never came. He might have taken warning by the fact that about the time of his marriage, after a long period of trade depression, he had found himself in considerable, though, as it proved, temporary difficulties. No doubt his circumstances had influenced him in marrying"], [270, "266 Vashti Savage. Avhen he did a woman os independent fortune. But he had been innocent then of misrepresentation and dis sembling. He had told her and her family \u2014 the members of Avhich had no control over her actions \u2014 how his affairs stood. She was willing to run the risk involved ; and when he took care that her money should be settled on herself, her relations had not interfered, where interference would have been useless. As it happened, her confidence had been justified in all respects. The tide of prosperity had resumed its flow, and for a number of years had been so bountiful that, if Mr. Swift had been prudent, he might still not only have freed himself from his embarrassments, but might have secured an ample competence. But prudence was not a word in his vocabulary ; as he had always been what people call a lucky man, he was confirmed in his recklessness by the closeness with which he had just \" shaved \" mis adventure, and come out with a triumphant immunity from loss. In place of carefully repairing old damage and decay, he left them to take care of themselves, and launched into new enterprises perilous in propor tion to the amount of gain they promised. Like most gamblers, whether in bank-stock, railway-shares, or on the turf and the green table, he was successful for a time, and was rendered still more assured and daring. He chose to think that he Avas called upon to repay"], [271, "Roger Swift in the Toils. 267 his wife's faith in him by surrounding her not only with all the luxuries but with all the costly rarities and exquisite achievements of a splendid scale of expendi ture ; the truth being that Mrs. Swift, though she had been accustomed to handsome surroundings, would have been perfectly contented with a much simpler entourage, and would positively have relished giving up something for the man she loved. To make things square, he said, he bought the better part of the Water Basset property for Ben. He continued the liberal allowances he had made to his other sons till their professions should be more remunerative. He in creased the already handsome allowance to his daughters \u2014 married and unmarried. What wonder that his chil dren should regard him as a Cr\u0153sus, the proprietor of an inexhaustible mine of gold, on which they could draw and draw again, without any fear of the consequences ? He pleased himself also with gratifying his really artistic tastes by collecting around him such chefs d'oeuvre in all departments, as might have graced the state-rooms of princes and millionaires. Prissy's studio was a little gem of its kind, in its marbles, mosaics, bronzes, carved ivories, tapestries, and royal tiger skins. At last another cycle of experience presented itself in Roger Swift's history, when failure took the place of attainment, and disaster instead of prosperity followed in the train of disaster, with a persistency and pre-"], [272, "268 Vashti Savage. cipitancy inconceivable to a man who had not gone through such a phase of experience before. Roger Swift had never been so pursued, harassed, and threatened in his life. He did not speak of his business troubles at home, but to those who knew and watched his looks he lost daily more and more of his old easy carriage, and of the buoyant bearing which was a reflection of the elastic spirit that, with him, had lasted long beyond the time of its natural foundation in the hopeful lightheartedness of youth. After it had sur vived the blow he had sustained in the death of his first wife, it had sprouted afresh and flourished apace all these years. But now it seemed in danger of swift and irremediable destruction. He was worried to the last degree. He was at an age and of a temperament to which protracted worry is next to unendurable. Roger Swift had been a sober, temperate man all his life, but under the terrible and continuous strain he had recourse more and more to stimulants to bolster up his strength and nerve, and to narcotics to lull him into oblivion ; and under this coarse, violent, artificial treatment his whole nature was fast degenerating. He grew sullen and morose instead of bland and bright, in the re action from the forced spirits he had brought about. He could not bear to be contradicted, he who had been so tolerant and indulgent. He worked himself up into frenzies of excitement \u2014 another instance of reaction"], [273, "Roger Swift in the Toils. 269 from the torpor into which he strove to drug himself. He systematically avoided Ben, who, though he did not know half or a quarter of what ailed his father, began to suspect something wrong, and to be concerned. But Roger Swift could not escape the observation of his wife and Prissy, and he could not evade Vashti, who would take no rebuff, and would not be put off the track when she had found it. Mrs. Swift and Prissy, who had not merely become \" like mother and daughter,\" but who had been veritable mother and daughter in all save the flesh and blood rela tion for well-nigh a dozen years, said little or nothing to each other in their anxiety and alarm. But they could not help studiously looking at their needlework or their books when the husband and father tarried longer and longer in the dining-room over his wine, and casting miserable, scared glances at each other when he appeared in the draAving-room Avith his flushed face and thickened utter ance. Prissy sought to judge from Mrs. Swift's counte nance, and Mrs. Swift sought to judge from Prissy's, without doing him whom they loved the dishonour of speaking of his failings, whether the deplorable traces of excess which they could not overlook Avere dreadful reali ties, or whether the women had lost their senses, and the grievous signs which they supposed they saw Avere but the wretched creations of their morbid brains. Vashti took another course, though she too said"], [274, "Vashti Savage. 270 nothing to her mistresses, after the slight hint to Miss Prissy which had caused her to look first furious and then broken-hearted, and had served as a lesson to the re tainer. But Vashti was constantly on the alert, to catch her master in time, and to interpose intrepidly betAveen him and the pitfalls among which he was stumbling heavily. She would enter the dining-room half-a-dozen times in the evening to fetch the tea-caddy, which was no business of hers ; to change the flower-glasses, which was Miss Prissy's duty; to fasten the window shutters, which Mr. Swift himself attended to the last thing before he went to bed. And the master of the house would turn with his hand on the decanter, and swear roughly at the servant to whom, when she was little better than a child and a common pest, he could not bring himself to speak an impatient word. Was she spying upon him and dogging him ? Who set her on to such insolent tricks ? It would be the worse for all the parties concerned if it were so, even supposing it proved to be little Prissy who Avas the undutiful offender. Again and again Roger Swift found that he had made mistakes about the supplies of chloral which he brought down from town and generally kept in his little medicine-chest. He would stare with eyes, which not only gloAved Avith strange fire but whose pupils were acquiring a fixed introverted look, at the empty bottles, and try to reckon with his reeling brain"], [275, "Roger Swift in the Toils. 271 how he could have swallowed their contents Avithout sleeping a sounder sleep than he had yet brought himself to contemplate. He would question himself whether he had left his key in the medicine-chest, whether any other keys in the house fitted into the lock, and Avho would dare to tamper with his property. At last one evening Roger Swift was late in arriving from town, and looked fearfully fagged and distrait on his arrival. But after he had dressed for dinner he appeared in much better spirits than he had been in for some time, and talked so incessantly, and with such almost boisterous hilarity at the dinner-table, that he succeeded in allaying his Avife's and daughter's fears for the moment. Ben AA'as dining at the Rectory, and was not likely to be soon home. Roger SAvift did not remain behind the ladies in the dining-room, but he excused himself from joining them again that evening. He had letters to write, which he would do in the library. He Avas afraid that it would take him till bed-time to get through with them, and he wanted nothing except a petit vcrre of brandy and a bottle of iced seltzer, since it was a sultry evening for the season \u2014 late spring. As he held open the door for his Avife and daughter to pass through, Mrs. Swift laid her kind hand on his arm, begging him not to OA-erwork himself, and asking if she might not sit by him while he Avrote, as she sometimes did. He declined her request, but patted"], [276, "Vashti Savage. 272 her hand, saying, more like his old self than he had spoken lately, that she was too kind to him. Then he claimed a good-night kiss from Prissy twice over. \" Take care of yourselves, my pets, and don't mind me,\" he charged them, as he stood for a moment look ing after them. When he reached the library and turned to close the door behind him, he found that Vashti, and not the new butler, had brought the brandy and seltzer and was placing it on the table. \" What does Gould mean by sending you to do his duty ? \" he inquired impatiently. And then he gaA'e a little shrug of his shoulders. \" You are always turning up^of late, Vashti. It is a case of ' And when he called another, Abra came.' But don't be too officious, lest it get you into a difficulty some day. Good-night !

While she talked her eyes Avere roaming about, and recognising that her master must have been in the library since he came from town, great as was the hurry he had seemed to be in. There was a box, and there were some packages lying here and there ; there was also some wearing apparel\u2014 an overcoat, though he had not worn one coming from his counting-house in such weather, and a wrap for the neck, as if the weather were winter and not on the verge of a hot summer, were hanging over a chair. A hat-box, as well as his letter-case, stood on the table. It was rather as if the occupant of the room were about to start on a journey, and not merely that he had returned from paying his daily visit to town. \"I'm sorry you are so busy,\" went on Vashti, \"for there is a question I have been thinking of putting to you for a long time, and I've made up my mind to do it to-night.\" \" Upon my word you have chosen your own time, and a mightily inconvenient one for me,\" said Mr. Swift, testily, sitting down, \"but fire away, and look sharp.\" Vashti stood before him in her tamed, decorous maid's dress of black woollen stuff, with her blue-black gipsy hair under a little eap, and her slender gipsy hands resting on her white apron. 18"], [278, "Vashti Savage. 274 \" Please, sir, what did my father do to my mother the night you caught me flying past you ? What became of both of them after you took me in charge ? \" \" How should I know ? \" he exclaimed, leaning back and grasping the arms of his chair, either as a support to his body or as aids to patience. Then a remem brance of the brutal circumstances and of the ghastly results which had attended them came back upon him Avith something of the old fellow-feeling \u2014 dull and blunted of late, which enabled him to comprehend how that past, seen dimly through a vista of years, must look to Vashti at this date. He understood with what repugnance, shame, and horror she must be approaching a topic on which she had been silent for many a day. He was roused to a certain extent from his intense pre-occupation. He was forced, even at that crisis, to think of another person, and to try and deal gently with her pain. Though it dated back to her childhood, it was still real, and might have been increased immeasurably by the mental change in her, while in its cause it set her apart from all other respectable girls in her position. \" My poor girl,\" he said, with a return to the earlier friendly kindness of demeanour which had endeared him to so many of his fellow-creatures, \" I do not know what was the fate of your father and mother. I tried to ascertain at the time you fell into my hands, but I could not do so for certain.

Mother would have sought after me.\" \" Well, then,\" said Mr. Swift, \" I Avish you to take this into consideration \u2014 not only that it was no fault of yours, but that your father was an utterly rude, untaught man, to whom his wife was little more than his donkey was, or his dog would have been if he had possessed a dog. According to your representation at the time, he was liable to gusts of passion over which he had probably little or no control, and erratic notions Avhich might have been incipient madness. He was in the habit of beating and mauling his unfortunate victim, and he did it once too often and too violently. Doubt less, he had no more intention of killing her outright then, if it came to that, than he had at any other time. The crime, hideous as it was, ansAvers to what we call manslaughter rather than murder. You must not measure him by higher standards. He was as ignorant"], [280, "276 Vashti Savage. as he was lawless, with hardly a conception of what he was doing or what might come of it.\" \"Yes, I know,\" said Vashti quickly; \"we were savages \u2014 English savages ; that was how I got my name. We were worse than many of the heathen as Miss Prissy sometimes tells me about ; nigh on a level with the brute beasts.\" \"I cannot deny it,\" said Roger Swift. \"It is no credit to English Christianity and civilisation that there are so many savages of the kind still in the country. But civilisation has its pains and penalties too,\" he added, with a sudden turn of the conversation, and a heavy sigh which was almost like a groan. \" Remember that, and forget and go to sleep on all the rest. The other is an old story now ; it is all over, and you may trust that the woes of those who had to do with it are ended here. If it were not so, you could do nothing for them.\" And he moved restlessly in his chair. \" I am not going yet a moment,\" said Vashti, still stand ing right before him with her short figure, which made her look younger than she was. \" I have another question to ask. What are you going to do to-night, master ? \" \"Good heavens! what is that to you?\" he cried, startled out of all presence of mind and maintenance of the ordinary every-day bearing he had been keeping up till now. \" Do you mean to say you have the imperti nence to attempt to question and control my movements ?"], [281, "The Lion and the Mouse. 277 We are coming to a pretty pass when our very maid servants interfere with our actions and take us to task ! \" \" You stopped me in what I was going to do more than once,\" she said calmly, \" and I mean to pay you back.\" \" When you were a child,\" he said angrily, \" and I was more than a grown man, the father of a family, Avith my youngest child nearly as old as you were, it was my duty to see what became of you. It is not your duty, it is unheard of presumption and folly in you to ask me what I am going to do, when, as you have heard me say, I daresay \" (with an aAvkward laugh) \" I am going to do nothing more extraordinary than write a few letters, and turn in for the night.

Don't force me to take you by the shoulders and turn you out.\" \" Master, you taught me not to lie,\" she said, with a meaning in her words, which was as if she, a girl and a servant, had struck the man in the face. It caused him to spring to his feet, quivering with rage and shame. \" If you are speaking true,\" she said again, \" what is this ? and this ? \" Before he knew what she was about she darted to a small package \u2014 the fellow of which, with the same druggist's label attached to it, she had seen more than once lately.

It will go off in your hands ! Do you hear me, Vashti ? Put it down when I bid you ! \" \" Not unless you let me lock it up and take the key,\" she said, handling the Aveapon fearlessly in a way that made his flesh creep and his blood run cold. \" What do I care though it go off? Better it should shoot me than you. Him as you calls your Master would understand that I was only laying down the life as belongs to you \u2014 as you saved, perhaps, and made worth having, for certain \u2014 for your sake, and for the sake of missus and Miss Prissy and Master Ben. But if you shoot yourself or another with it, then it would be murder, like what my father did, and there would be no such excuse for you as you made for him. You are not ignorant, or brutal, or a savage. There, I see you cannot abide to have me or any man, woman, or child run a risk, which he would not have minded, Avhether it were his own flesh and blood or a stranger as ran it, poor hardened, stupid father ! But you would harden and stupefy yourself, sir, till you could propose to take the life which you have taught me God gave, and that is no more yours to take than the life of missus, or me, or any other.

I choose to keep a drug by me which induces sleep, of which I have need enough, in all conscience ; but that is not to say that I am going to use either the one or the other for my own destruction.\" \" Master,\" she said again, with a mixture of sadness and sternness, \"you taught me not to lie.\" He did not fly into a rage this time ; he had not recovered from the shock he had received. He felt as if the strength and spirit had gone out of him. \"At least,\" he said doggedly, \"you may believe that I only had them as a last resource.\" Then he told her more of his intentions, with a rush of words, as if in his despair he craved a confidant ; and in his weakness he turned to his servant, the girl whom he had rescued from the ditches and gutters, Avhose antecedents were Avhat Vashti's were.

He could not crush and kill her Avith a Avord as he felt he might kill his Avife and Prissy. He had meant to fly that night, to escape from the detection of the wrong he had done and the vengeance which was close at his heels. The overcoat and Avrappei were for his night journey by train to the first junction, where he would seek to double on his course and cheat his pursuers, till he got to a seaport and found a ship bound for a country which had no extradition treaty AA'ith England, the government of which Avas not bound to send him back to suffer for the wrong he had done. Of course he had done wrong, he exclaimed almost pettishly, as if Vashti doubted the fact. She would not understand what kind of wrong ; but, in short, he had run through his money, Avanted more, and had taken what belonged to others, Avhich he had in his power, as he was one of the directors of a company which had trusted him with their property. Well, he had managed to deceive his fellow-directors and bring them to ruin and disgrace, and the next day they would be down upon him. \" Your father did not betray his brother gipsies, did he ? \" he stopped to ask her. \" He let Uncle Reconcile be taken for him and suffer in his stead,\" she said gravely."], [287, "The Lion and the Mouse. 283 \" Ah !\" he cried bitterly ; \" it is a comfort to think that he was not so much better than I, after all. But why do you not say to me, ' Master, you taught me not to steal' ? \" She was silent ; and something of the abashed look which he had dreaded to see in the face of the wife who had so admired him, in that of the daughter who had so believed in him, and in that of the son in whom he believed, stole into her face. He tried to put it away from him by more disclosures and revelations. He had been living on the verge of detection for several months ; that day he kneAv it was all up with him. To-morrow there Avas to be a meeting of the share holders of the company, which he was summoned to attend. When he did not appear, what was already suspected Avould be investigated, and before night infor mation would be given by his betrayed and indignant A'ictims, and a Avarrant issued for his apprehension. There was no escape, and no mercy would be shoAvn to him. His creditors were not so many Uncle Reconciles. Then he turned out the contents of the hat-box, and disclosed a false wig and beard, which were meant to disguise him like the rogue he was. \" Your father was an honester ruffian, Vashti. I bought these pretending that they were wanted for private theatricals.\" He had begun by making the exhibition with confu sion of face ; and yet so complex was the nature of the"], [288, "284 Vashti Savage. man that he was evidently tickled, even at that moment, with the cleverness of the aids to masquerading Avhich he had provided. He expected Vashti to be struck in the same manner, and to cry out with Avonder and admiration when he showed her how he would haA-e fastened the raven crop of hair and the jet black beard Avhich corresponded with it. There was something of the boy in the man to this hour. He actually lost sight of the miserable occasion for the device in its smartness. He spoke, too, as if he expected her to advise his going, and to help him in his midnight flight. But she only said, looking with the utmost serious ness at the grotesque figure he cut, \" What ! Leave missus, and Miss Prissy, and Master Ben ? \" \"Why should I stay to bring disgrace upon them ?\" he demanded impatiently, pulling off the theatrical outfit Avith Avhich he was rendered out of conceit by Vashti's lack of appreciation of its merits. \" My wife has means ; she and Prissy can follow me if they care to do it.\" \" The disgrace would come on them all the same,\" said Vashti bluntly, \"only they Avould have to face it Avithout you.\" \"Better so,\" was his gloomy reply. \"Why, Avhat would you have me do ? What Avould you do in my place ? \" leaning back, and looking curiously at her. \" Restore them fourfold !\" \" But if there was nothing to make restitution with,"], [289, "The Lion and the Mouse. 285 you foolish girl ?

Is that all you have to say ? \" She came nearer to him and spoke low, with a flush mounting to her forehead and her breast heaving. \" Master, you have spoken to me sometimes of another Master \u2014 yours and mine, and all the world's.

To be like a child again in spirit ! To confess not to a priest, but to his injured friends and associates, to pay the penalty, to have his breast emptied of all the foul stuff which was stifling and poisoning him, to have done from that moment with mean dodges and base evasions, to knoAV and suffer the worst, to seek to repair, though it were in the weakest, most inefficient fashion, and with an accompaniment of utter unbelief, taunts and re\\-ilings, the evil he had done, that was his only refuge. In this lay his sole chance of peace. To wash in the Jordan of self-abasement and voluntary degradation was the single step which would in a mea sure cancel the past that would still never be forgotten, and give him back not his good name \u2014 that was gone beyond recovery, \u2014 but his fallen integrity, his original nature, open and honest, pure and upright as a child's. He saw it all in a flash, and pulled himself together, bringing all the faculties of his body and mind to help him. He recalled every higher influence of his life,"], [291, "The Lion and the Mouse. 287 his faith in Christ, every better resolve he had made, every true prayer he had prayed. His long-lost dead, the father and mother to whom he had been a good son, the brother and sister Avith whom he had been on terms of close friendship, were with him again. The love he had borne his young wife, the esteem and tender regard he had felt for the woman who had loved him, who was the partner of his later life, his pride in his children and fondness for them \u2014 all came back to him. He summoned one and all of these influences to enable him to do the hard thing required of him, the thing he had brought on himself, the burden on his back that could only be laid down in one sense, in one way. He had buried his face in his hands ; he had dropped one hand and leant long on the other. When he looked up there was Vashti Savage still standing like an accusing conscience, like his guardian angel in a queer disguise mutely waiting for his decision. \" You are right, Vashti ; you have hit the mark. I'll do it, God helping me.\" He spoke quietly, almost feebly. He had been so tempest-tossed of late ; he was so weary ; and in place of having reached the haven of rest where he fain would have been, he was girding himself up for a gigantic effort. \" I hear Master Ben coming in,\" said Vashti wistfully. \" No, not to-night ; no !

But don't be under any further apprehension for me. My mind is made up, and I honestly believe I'll be helped to go through with what I have to do.\" And he shivered slightly. \"Ay, master ; for there are chariots and horses of fire all around where you are sitting,\" said Vashti, with solemn earnestness. \" Maybe. I wish I could see them,\" he said dreamily. \" But such a sight, in the room of a forlorn hope, is not for a weak, despicable rascal like me. You may take away these things,\" with a disgusted glance at the wig and wrapper. \"I'll never use them ; and I am not going to write to-night ; there is no need. God bless you, Vashti ! I think you've saved your master \u2014 no great prize, but still \" \"Like the mouse saved the lion,\" said Vashti eagerly. \"A sorry lion, poor mouse !\" When she had got to her own room, she told herself sadly, \" What a day to-morrow will be for my poor missus and for Miss Prissy and Master Ben, as well as for master ! Oh ! don't I wish I could take it all on my own shoulders, and go to them gentlemen and say, ' I done it. Punish me as you please, I'll bear it.'

NEXT day Ben was summoned to an early inter- view with his father, which lasted so long that the two had the shortest time possible in which to eat their breakfast, if they would not miss the train in which it was announced that the young man was to accompany Mr. Swift to town. Ben was so grave and pre-occupied, Avhile he forced himself to appear at the breakfast-table and swallow a cup of coffee, and Roger Swift, though outwardly calm, looked so haggard, that Mrs. Swift and Prissy knew, Avithout waiting to be told, that some misfortune had happened. They could hardly repress themselves till the lingering hours crept on to evening, v\\hen the husband and father had volunteered a promise that they should know everything. By the four o'clock train Ben arrived without his father, looking as if he had grown ten years older in anticipation of the trial he had to undergo 19"], [294, "Vashti Savage. 290 in telling his mother and sister the tidings he was empowered to convey to them. Roger Swift was a bankrupt. His affairs were in great confusion; what was far worse, there was a mess in the accounts of the Imperial Insurance Company, of which he was the managing director. There was no mistake, the adored husband of the one woman, and the beloved father of the other, had openly admitted misappropriation of the company's funds and of other trusts committed to his care, and he had told Ben beforehand what he might expect. Mr. Swift had been arrested and taken before a magistrate. He had been bailed out, but was re maining in London in order to be at hand to render all the assistance which only he could give, in going over and clearing up the accounts, and pointing out his defalcations. The grievous blow was broken to the unhappy women by the immediate determination which they took, almost simultaneously, to go up that very night to London to be with Roger Swift. It might, nay, it must have been so when he himself said it, though they could hardly believe his own words, that he had been a worse than careless man of business \u2014 an un faithful steward. But he was the head of the house, and until the last few months the kindest, gentlest husband and father. Would it become his wife and daughter to fail him in his adversity ? Fail him !"], [295, "Reparation. 291 Like Vashti, they would have given much to have taken the punishment on their own meek, blameless shoulders, and borne it for him. Stunned as well as shocked, and hurried in the preparation for their sudden journey, there could not be any communication with friends, or waste of time in the discussion of what had taken place. Vashti would have felt aggrieved at being left behind on such an occasion had not Prissy told her, \"We depend upon you staying here, Vashti ; for the others know nothing yet, though I daresay they suspect that \u2014 that my father has lost his money, and we shall be poor. Oh ! that would not matter much, if it were not for other things ; but soon everything will be known. Ben will have to come backwards and for wards in the meantime, and I shall have to return for a day or so. Everything cannot be arranged at once. My poor mother must not be left without her ordinary comforts. She will feel lost in apartments in London. Oh dear, it is dreadful ! I think I will tell you, Vashti ; for you may hear it at any moment, and you will feel for us. There is something wrong in the accounts with which my father was entrusted. There will be a trial, and as he has supplied the evidence against himself, there can be no denial of the charge. He must be found guilty and a sentence passed on him. Poor, dear father ! how could he have"], [296, "Vashti Savage. 292 been so left to himself? I could almost persuade myself he was dreaming \u2014 that Ave are all dreaming.\" Vashti shook her head and did not look up. \" But is it not like him,\" cried Prissy, catching at the single crumb of comfort, \" to come forward and own his sin and make restitution as far as he can, not to slink off like a cowardly traitor, not to let others be suspected ? Ben says they were not hard upon him to-day. They were taken aback by his making his appearance and admitting the truth. One man \u2014 I could bless him for it \u2014 protested that he did not believe it, not even from my father's own mouth. There were only two or three very bitter, refusing to take my father's word, storming and maintaining there was something kept back \u2014 there always was in these cases \u2014 they would not trust the smallest state ment of his, a man who had made the professions my father had made, and had failed as he had done ; they would see him transported with pleasure.

One of the worst was the Mr. LaAvrence who used to come down and dine here every summer.\" \"Never mind what they said, Miss Prissy; master is making atonement.

Don't let our disgrace tempt us to slander others in seeking to bring them to the same low pass as ourselves. If we do, it will be one of the worst forms of our punishment.\" \" Well, just you wait and see,\" persisted Vashti. Strange to say, Vashti Avas in this instance a true prophetess. Not many years passed before a pecu liarly dishonourable and cruel fraud, in the course of another great company's collapse, disclosed Mr. Lawrence as the chief culprit, one of many years' standing. Roger Swift, who Avas then at liberty, turned aside an ashen-hued, shame-stricken face when the cab which contained LaAvrence and the policeman Avho had arrested him drove past, followed by a hoot ing crowd, on its way to the court-room. Lawrence steadily denied his offence, and refused all information which he was not compelled to supply. His lawyer found a flaw in the indictment ; in the end the offender got off, retired abroad, and lived there, surrounded by every comfort and luxury which unaccounted-for affluence could supply. The morning after Roger Swift's confession, Avhen the truth was beginning to leak out among the dis mayed servants at the Great House, Avith whom loss"], [298, "Vashti Savage. 294 of place and the possible loss of half a month's wages were in general considerations which usurped every other, the disorganised household Avas startled by an early visit from Lady Grace Neville. She drove up ir. her pony phaeton, with only a boy groom behind her, and asked if Vashti Savage could come out and speak to her. The moment Vashti crossed the threshold Lady Grace leapt nimbly from her seat and drew Vashti aside, telling the boy to drive slowly down the avenue, and she Avould meet him at the lodge. \"Is it true, Vashti?

Lady Grace coloured slightly, and drew herself up perceptibly, as at a liberty taken with her. For all her frankness and kindness she was a Avoman who could keep her own ground, with whom few durst take liberties. \" Of course my daughter feels deeply for her young friends \u2014 Miss Prissy and her brother ; but naturally it is not the same to Miss Neville as to the Rector and me, Avho AA-ere Mr. and Mrs. Swift's friends.

It is right that her father and I should spare her sometimes. We haA'e been keeping her a great deal too much to ourselves lately.

We may all go there, where nobody knows us, only my father and mother are getting old, and I don't look much cut out for a colonial life, do I, Vashti ? \" asked Prissy, with a forlorn smile, letting her eyes fall for an instant on the shadow of her figure cast upon the window-blind. \"I wonder to hear you, I do, Miss Prissy!\" cried Vashti indignantly; \"ain't the master a better man to-day than he Avere last month, last year ? Ain't he washed clean ? Wouldn't it be a black shame for any one to twit him with an offence as he has owned to and is done with ? \" \"Yes, yes, in the sight of God, let us hope. Among ourseh'es we will try to forget it ever happened,\" said Prissy feverishly. \" We'll do our best to bury it out of sight. But that is not the judgment of the world. It cannot, perhaps it ought not to be. And, Vashti, I don't think it is right or kind to poor Ben and Miss Neville to go on discussing their affairs, without asking their consent, though it goes to my heart to see him so grave and old-looking, and hear him walking up and down his room at night. I know what he is suffering, though he does not say a Avord of his own share in the trial, but tries to make the best of eA'erything for my mother's"], [303, "Reparation. 299 sake, and mine, and my father's. However much Ben has been cut up, he would not reproach my father to his face or behind his back ; and, between you and me, Vashti, that is not how all my brothers and sisters haA-e acted,\" and Prissy's little pinched face flushed up at the recollection, \"even though we are holding together ; and I don't know that anybody is meaning to be harsh or disrespectful. But about Ben and Gracey, \u2014 I may join their names together again just this once,\" said Prissy, speaking more to herself than to her companion. \" I am glad now that I did not say or do a thing to cloud my poor dear old Ben's short dream of happiness.\" \" She ain't AA'orthy of him,\" broke out Vashti hotly, \" if she can give him up ! She don't deserA-e him ! \" \" No, Vashti ; it is you who don't understand,\"' said Prissy solemnly. \" Well, I used to be glad I could slip into a dry ditch, and go Avithout my dinner, and pick up my living anyhow, at other folks' expense. But though I've changed my mind on that, I am glad I ain't a lady. I thought I were come of kings and queens out of the East ; but whether I were right or wrong, I am right down glad that I ain't a cold-blooded, properly behaved young lady.\" \" You're talking nonsense now, Vashti,\" said Prissy, with her old little air of superior wisdom. Mr. Swift's elder sons and daughters, however they"], [304, "Vashti Savage. 300 might reflect upon him amongst themselves for bringing them up as he had done, accustoming them to allow ances which he could not afford, of which they must now be deprived, and leading them to expect something like separate fortunes at his death, certainly rallied round him in their own way. Many of his old allies, eA'en of his rivals in business, were touched, not so much by his downfall as by the manner in which he had come fonvard and admitted what, when all was said, was certainly fraudulent practice. Even some of the company who had been sufferers would have willingly compromised and hushed up the matter if it had rested with them ; but things had gone too far ; the law had been brought in, and must ha\\'e its due ; an example must be made. Roger Swift accepted the conclusion ; he did not even desire it to be otherwise. There was something slightly exalte about him during these unhappy days, but there was not an atom of insincerity, not a shade of posing. He did not even entertain the false idea that he was a martyr; he was only saved by a certain singleness of heart and manliness which made him come forward and endure the worst. He lost flesh ; he grew gaunt; his grizzled hair became nearly white ; but he was earnest, almost eager to pay his pound of flesh and complete his sacrifice. People said that Roger Swift was a melancholy"], [305, "Reparation. 301 spectacle on the day of his trial, and there was truth in the statement. But though he hung his head, as he well might, instead of holding it up among his fellows, he was calm, even throughout the passing of the sentence. Though it sounded severe, it was in fact lenient in consideration of the trouble he had saved, and the assistance he had rendered in making plain his own guilt. He was condemned to a year's imprison ment without any further indignity. \" They have dealt mercifully with me,\" he said quite unaffectedly to his counsel, in Ben's hearing. \" Imprisonment for a year or eA'en tAvo years is little \u2014 though I am getting an old man \u2014 after what I have done. Of course, I can never forgive myself, and it is the thought of the losses of those who could worst afford to lose which comes hardest upon me.\" \" Upon my word,\" said Ben, with a break in his voice, to Prissy, \" it sounded as if the poor old fellow thought himself too well off, and was hankering after the treadmill and the hulks.\" Mrs. SAvift's first impulse had been to giA'e up her fortune to her husband's creditors, and fling it into the gulf which he had made. But everybody, including Ben and Prissy, combined to tell her she could not. Even those of the friendly creditors, to whose ears the offer came, put it from them as a generous absurdity. She must not be allowed to strip herself in order to"], [306, "Vashti Savage. 302 drain a sew drops from the ocean of her husband's liabilities. The harder creditors called the suggestion sentimental clap-trap. She might provide for Swift and those of his children who chose to be dependent upon her. They believed there was a deformed girl, and a lad who had been a hanger-on at home, and she might save those of the creditors, who were fools enough to think it called for, a voluntary allowance to the man who had been their friend, and who had not scrupled to use the friendship to hoodwink and plunder them. Mrs. Swift Avas thankful at last to be permitted to do this. She took a house as near as possible to the prison in which Roger Swift was shut up, that she and Prissy might visit him constantly. It was a small comfort to the poor lady that her windows commanded a view of its stacks of chimneys. They were the last thing she looked at every night, and the first every morn ing. Sometimes she stole up in moonlight or the early dawn and strove to catch a glimpse of them, while she prayed fervently for the erring man who had been her first and last love, the kindest of husbands, who was there \" dreeing his weird \" \u2014 more than content to dree it ; like Newman's Gerontius, plunging into the veritable purgatorial fires which were to consume the dross that had marred the gold of his Christian manhood. Prissy and Vashti were with Mrs. Swift. Ben was not in town. While the affairs of the great bankruptcy"], [307, "Reparation. 303 case were being wound up, he continued to manage the estate at Water Basset for the behoof of the creditors, the more lenient overpowering the dissenting voices, and ordaining that it should be so. They meant it in kindness, and to shoAv that they retained their trust in somebody of the name of Swift who had not been implicated in poor Roger's transgression. But it was a tremendous strain on Ben, all things considered, though there was no danger of his encountering Gracey, not even when he went to the Rectory, where the blind Rector pined to see him, and Lady Grace nearly broke him down by her tender respect and thoughtful kind- ness. Gracey Neville continued abroad with the younger members of Lord Barton's family, after the heads of the house had returned to their parliamentary and social duties. Still, the whole thing was so severe a pull on Ben that he counted the time till he should be free. But when he was in town and went straight to see his father, none could have guessed, unless by the lines between his eyes and at the corners of his mouth, what serious work life had become to him. The first gleam of better things was in the discovery that Roger Swift's estate, even in those bad times, yielded a good deal more than had been expected, and promised nearly to double the dividend which had been counted on in the beginning. In spite of his easy temper he had been a man liable to see things in"], [308, "Vashti Savage. 304 extremes. The next boon was the sale of the estate of Water Basset, with the Great House and its trea sures, which were not every man's bargain, as it stood, to considerable advantage. The money thus secured, with the pickings of Roger Swift's estate, would go far to cover the deficit in the company's accounts and in other trusts, though nothing would alter the fact that those trusts had been betrayed. There were circumstances in connection with the sale of the Water Basset property and the Great House which, though they were of no interest to the creditors, concerned the Swifts. The purchaser was Lord Raby, the eldest son of Lord Barton. His lordship had inherited a large fortune from a member of his mother's family, and had come of age some time before, so that he could invest his available money in any form he chose. Lady Grace Neville plumed herself on having influenced his decision, which was a double benefit : it would bring her nephew and other members of her own family nearer to her; and it Avould help the poor dear Swifts, to whom the place, with all its expensive improve ments and extravagant accompaniments of orchid-houses, pineries, and so forth, must be a great embarrassment. At once all the old, half-slumbering reports of Lord Raby's marriage to his cousin sprang into full activity, and it was currently said, \"on the best authority,\" that"], [309, "Reparation. 305 he had bought Water Basset to please her and to enable her to be for a large part of the year near her father. Ben Swift listened to this version of the purchase with his head thrown back, his eyelids drooped, his chin a little projected. What did it signify to him ? At least his escape was secured. It is not on record whether Ben was as much elec trified as the public, when, after running down and making a single inspection of his new property, Lord Raby Avas next heard of as having started for South America in the course of a two years' tour of the world. When Roger Swift's time was up, hke that of any ordinary criminal, and he left his prison in the quietest manner possible in a cab with his wife and youngest daughter, he drove to Mrs. Swift's house in the neighbourhood. There, after a few days, was held a gathering of his family to consult what he and others had better do. All the members of the family were not present. Tom and Ned were not home from India and Australia, and, as they had certified, were not likely to be so again in a hurry, after Avhat had happened. Clara had sent an apology from the Black Forest, where she was making studies ; as it Avas now essential for her to live by her art, it would not be advisable for her to lose the autumn tints. Charlie, the doctor, was there ; he had been so struck by the appearance of his father when he saw him in prison 20"], [310, "306 Vashti Savage. that he had come up again to make his observations. Mary, the lawyer's wife, was present with her lawyer, who had taken the interest of a professional man as Avell as of a near relative in his father-in-law's case. Alexa and her vicar were with Clara in the Black Forest for their clerical holiday, which they could not miss. When it came to that, their clerical dignity was too much outraged for them to hasten their return in order to Avelcome \u2014 whom ? A bankrupt, a convicted swindler out of prison. Annie, the nurse, had married, just before the esclandre, a pushing young doctor with his way to make in the world. She could not yet look her husband in the face, or bring him to look her father in the face, after the couple's unmerited disappointment in the loss of her allowance and the failure of her ex pectations. Arthur, the land-agent, was there, and Ben and Prissy of course. Mrs. Swift sat beside her husband, and never took her eyes from him, which might have been intolerable to some men. But Roger SAvift in his better days had never been either irritable or fanciful. He smiled gently back at her, and put his bony hand upon hers, which Avas also beginning to be large-jointed and Avrinkled under the lace frills, worn so invariably that people would not have known her without them. It was a saying of Gracey Neville's, that she believed Mrs. Swift slept in lace frills, lavender bows, and pearl brooches."], [311, "CHAPTER XVI. TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF. INHERE had not happened to be so many of the * scattered family gathered together since they had been summoned to hear the announcement of Roger Swift's second marriage. He remembered that scene. It had been awkward ; but that of to-day was still more awkward and painful, though somehow he did not seem to feel it so much as he might have expected. Was it coming out of prison which gave him the sense of being like a disembodied spirit in a company of human beings, removed to a certain extent from their worries and annoyances ? Was it the discipline he had undergone which prevented him from being greatly A-exed by an alteration in the tone of his children towards him ? Was it very wrong in him, flippant, heartless, almost shameless, to be slightly tickled by it, held in check as it was ? Nobody was openly disre spectful, \u2014 the Swifts were too well-bred for that, even"], [312, "Vashti Savage. 308 if they had not been fairly right-minded, reasonable, and not bad-hearted. However much their father had shocked and failed them, however resentful they might have felt against him, at the time, and in the interval since the disclosure, they had put force on themselves, they were sorry for him, and were there to show their sympathy and to do what they could to help him. As for Charlie, the doctor, he did not like to find that his father had ceased to form plans for himself when his imprisonment ended. It was totally unnatural in the old active-minded, cheerful-tempered man, \u2014 Charlie did not like it at all. Resignation is all very well, but there is something akin to despair in it. Who can live on, bruised and broken, submissive but hope less ? Something must be done for him. Nobody knew that better than Roger Swift ; yet it was queer to hear his children arranging for him, and quietly seeking, whether they knew it or not, to get rid of him, to induce him to go away out of people's sight and hearing, and be a scandal to their world no more. \"It might be a good opportunity for you to pay a visit to Tom. India is a wonderful country, most interesting to strangers,\" said Arthur. \"To be sure the climate might be a little trying at your age and Mrs. Swift's. But the same thing cannot be said of Australia ; and I have a strong fancy you would enjoy Ned's pastoral life.\""], [313, "Turning over a New Lea 309 \" Don't you think some nice little quiet town abroad would suit you and Mrs. Swift best ? \" said Mary, to whom Charlie had imparted some of his fears. \" There are hundreds of such places in France and Germany quite near home, and of course we should all come o\\'er and see you as often as we could.\" \"Say SAvitzerland and not France,\" said Mary's lawyer, with an eye to his summer playground in spite of his gout. \" It would be a more complete change, and that is what you want.\" \"Yes, my father wants a change,\" said Charlie oracularly ; \" but a permanent residence in a dull foreign town, in which he has not a particle of interest and knows nobody, never \u2014 never ! \" \" Why don't you say a South Sea island or the interior of Africa at once ? \" demanded Ben, so ironically that his father turned and looked at him. Prissy had just been speaking aside to him. \" We are all thinking of ourselves, not of him or my mother. We are not considering that in no place would his virtues be so well knoAvn, his errors so soon forgotten, as in the old place which he loved. We are making him play the cowardly part which he did not play at the worst. I do not see that it is possible for him to go back to the neighbourhood, but it is a great pity that none of us will mention it.\" \"You have mentioned it, dear,\" said Ben ; and then"], [314, "Vashti Savage. 310 he thought of news he had heard that very morning, and of what Charlie had said to him, how he believed his father's life hung on a thread, and that while he wished for a change to rouse him, he dreaded that the removal from all his old associations might snap the slender cord at once. \" My father and mother are too old for such changes as you propose,\" said Ben. \" You would not like it, sir, noAV, would you ? \" appealing pointedly to his father, \" to start to inspect rice-fields and visit sheep runs at this date ? You would weary your heart out leading an utterly idle life in a strange town, for I cannot think Avhat you would find to do there ? It would be lonely and unhome-like for my mother and Priss. If you were a jaunty old gentleman, and were to go to some fashionable resort and rush into all its gaieties \" \" Ben ! \" interrupted more than one voice in scandal ised remonstrance. \" Ben, old fellow, you're losing your head, I think,\" said his father, bestirring himself, which Avas what Ben wished him to do, but still speaking languidly. \" Of course, the quietest, least expensive quarters are what we must have. I am quite willing to go where you and the rest of you think best. I would rather you chose for me, if your mother here and Prissy have no preference. I don't doubt they will accommodate"], [315, "Turning over a New Leaf. 311 themselves to my locality, though I don't seem to care about it.\" Charlie covertly shook his head, and the speech sounded most melancholy to Ben. It did not sound melancholy in Roger's own ears. He owed it to his children, and it was a miserably small reparation to let them have their will in disposing of him for the remainder of his clouded life, as seemed best to them. He Avas thinking softly at the same time that they had not been bad children to care so much Avhat became of him ; and no man could call himself poor and for lorn with two such faithful followers as his wife and Prissy \u2014 nay, Avith three, for Vashti would be in their train, and surely where they were that would be home to him. He was repeating to himself, \"Where thou goest I Avill go, where thou dwellest I will dwell,\" and telling himself honestly that he was unworthy of such attachment and of so many mercies. \" I propose,\" said Ben loudly and firmly, \" that my father and mother and Prissy go back with me, if you will agree to it, sir,\" turning again to his father. \" I have had a letter from Lord Raby this morning, asking me to continue to manage Water Basset \u2014 in short, to accept the agency from him. He says he will not be near the place for years, and will probably never reside much there, though he made the purchase not only because he considered it a good investment, but also"], [316, "Vashti Savage. 312 from a fancy he had for a house of his own in a hunting country near his relations, the Nevilles. He writes that he Avould rather I occupied the house and saw it was kept in order, than have anybody else there as a regular tenant, which would prevent his coming down when he liked. Father, mother, what do you think of it ? You will be among all your old friends, and I know Prissy will like to get possession of her studio again.\" He tried to end lightly ; for he saw that his father, who had listened with repressed excitement, was flushing scarlet and getting much excited,* while Mrs. Swift leant forward with clasped hands, and Prissy could not help crying, \u2014 \"Oh, Ben, how good of you ! I am so thankful, so glad ! Dear old Water Basset ! we could never be so well anywhere else.\" \"My boy,\" said Roger Swift in a shaken voice, \" thanks for being so ready to have me and not mind ing the disgrace I have brought upon you. But I ought to mind. As for old friends, they might not like \u2014 they might not care to see me again among them.\" \"Nonsense, father!\" said Ben brusquely. \"They will all be pleased to see you. Has nobody ever done wrong before ? \" he cried passionately. \" Has none of us ever erred or been tempted to err ? or, if we have been so singularly fortunate, are we so sure that we shall never fall in all the time to come ?"], [317, "Turning over a New Leaf. \u25a0y t t O1 J They know what a kind friend and neighbour you were, though I say it who should not say it ; how generous, and liberal, and Avilling to share all you had ; Avhat a poAver for good in the parish. The Rector was referring to it the last time I saw him. Is all this to be forgotten because of those solitary lapses from just dealing ? Are these shortcomings, grievous as you yourself have acknowledged them, to weigh against and cancel the whole tenor of your life ? You have paid the penalty \u2014 is it not fit that justice should be tempered with mercy ? \" Nobody raised an objection to Ben's argument; perhaps it awoke just a little uncertainty and contrition in the hearts of those present. If Ben liked to take the responsibility, and their father could face such a return to the old neighbourhood \u2014 which was certainly retired and out of the Avorld \u2014 there was no more to be said. Mr. and Mrs. Swift and Prissy, with Vashti, went back to Water Basset ; not to the Great House \u2014 that was held to be undesirable in some respects and unbe coming in others, though the family would have been but tenants at Lord Raby's pleasure, where they had once been the owners. Ben was to hold the house for his employer ; while Mr. Swift and the women of the family were to occupy a house \u2014 which Mrs. Swift insisted was quite good enough \u2014 not far off. Only Prissy was to come up and work in her studio, for"], [318, "Vashti Savage. 314 which Lord Raby could have no use, after she had taken care that all its valuable properties were dis tributed in the other rooms, and it was converted into a simple workwoman-like den. It was among the happiest and proudest moments of her after-life, when she could do work the price of which contributed to swell the family exchequer. The return of the family was very unobtrusive ; and, as most people guessed, so sad at heart, in spite of its surface cheerfulness, that any hostility which had ever been excited in the vicinity was overpowered or rendered silent for very shame. Whatever his faults, Roger Swift had carried his cup of prosperity very quietly. He had never been arrogant or exacting ; he had never been uplifted or high-minded. He had always con descended to men of low estate, and in his adversity the world was not so destitute of good-feeling as to forget that. It seemed to him that he saw nothing but kind looks, heard nothing save kind words on all sides. He would not go abroad more than he could help. He was shy of encountering former acquaintances, not to say strangers ; but the feeling was in himself, not, so far as he could see, in them. He was soothed by the aspect of the life he had been used to all around him. The state of exaltation in Avhich he had dwelt since he had determined to atone in the only way"], [319, "Turning over a New Leaf. 315 he knew for his sin was gradually sobered down and calmed. He was apparently as much interested as he had always been, with his quick sympathies, in every thing which concerned his neighbours. He had been easily occupied and entertained ; in spite of his artistic and splendour-loving side, he had been radically a man of simple tastes. He was pleased, not disgusted, with the old farmhouse which Mrs. Swift and Prissy, Ben and Vashti, were engaged in fitting up for his home. He could not help being sometimes as much engrossed and excited as the youngest of them was. He selected the smallest room for his own, and arranged it himself. He undertook the laying out of the garden with his own hands, and carried it through with much satisfac tion to himself and every member of the family. He took a peculiar pleasure in showing Vashti Savage, who grinned back her admiration, how much he could do for himself and other people, how many luxuries and privileges he could resign without regret. Some times, when he fell into his old festive vein, and his genial laugh rang out as of old, he called himself back and reproached himself. Occasionally, but not so often, other people who came across him in these moods were slightly scandalised. But there was no call either for his self-reproach or their halting accusa tion. He was always happiest when some of the old company who had felt most for him appealed to his"], [320, "316 Vashti Savage. experience, and showed the faith they still had in him by asking his help in settling their affairs. He would go up daily to London and work unweariedly in their service, without their venturing to speak of remunera tion. He would look almost young and hale again under the stimulus. The mind of the public of Water Basset had been much exercised by Lord Raby's behaviour. What did he mean ? Had his cousin rejected him ? Had he never made her an offer ? Had she contrived to interest him in the Swifts, one of whom \u2014 Ben \u2014 had certainly been an occasional playfellow of his lordship's at the Rectory, Avhen they were both boys ? Or was it the simple truth, Avhich Lord Raby asserted and Lady Grace confirmed ? When he came down to look at the place he had been struck with the good order in Avhich he had found everything, and had been at once prompted to secure young Swift's services as his agent, particularly when he knew him to be a gentleman and a companionable fellow, and remembered him as an old acquaintance. Probably, as the least sensational version of a surprising occurrence is very often the correct one, Lord Raby and Lady Grace were right in their explanation. It is not unlikely at the same time that Lady Grace neither foresaw nor altogether realised, at first, the turn of events by which Ben Swift remained a fixture at"], [321, "Turning over a New Leaf. 317 Water Basset, and the proximity of all those members of the family, who were her dear friends, was as assured as formerly. Doubtless she agreed in this, if in nothing else, with Mrs. Swift's absent sons and daughters, that a nice little secluded spot, say in the Channel Islands, or in one of the old Flemish towns, where a prolonged stay might be an advantage to a young artist, would have been the fittest refuge under the circumstances for Mr. and Mrs. Swift and Prissy, what ever became of Ben ; and poor Ben, Avho had behaved admirably, was less dangerous and more easily kept at a distance without his family. But when the Swifts came down for good to Water Basset Farm, late in the autumn, Lady Grace could not do less than call on them immediately, and when she saw them again she could not resist kissing and crying over Mrs. Swift and Prissy ; nay, she was so far carried aAvay by her feelings, being an impulsive, Avarm-hearted woman on the natural side of her, that she actually not only shook hands with Roger Swift, but stooped and kissed her old friend where he sat, before he could get up to receive her, as a loving, forgiving sister might ha\\'e done. Still that was not to say that Lady Grace was going to sacrifice her only child by permitting her to make what would now be a deplorable mesalliance, and Gracey could not stay away for ever. She had not only been away for a long time"], [322, "318 Vashti Savage. after the SAvifts left Water Basset ; she had been hardly ever at home during the year of Mr. Swift's imprison ment. The Rector had been induced to spend the latter part of it abroad, where his daughter had joined him, while Lady Grace and the curate had Avorked the parish admirably between them in the interval. But both father and daughter were coming home for Christmas, which was at the door. The danger was that nature, having been once or twice too much for Lady Grace, might overcome her yet another time. Accordingly, the very first day after Gracey Neville returned to the Rectory, looking more graceful and aristocratic than ever, she announced that she was going over to see' the Swifts, and Lady Grace could not find words with which to forbid the expedi tion to her daughter. She did take the precaution to accompany her ; but she was again struck dumb when Gracey, availing herself of the brother and sister terms on Avhich the young people had grown up together, reminded Ben, when he was hanging back, that he had been wont to escort her mother and her home on the Avinter afternoons. \" Are you not coming with us, Ben ? My father is wearying to see you. I have got the dearest little Yorkshire Rough puppy, which my cousin Raby gave me before he went to America, to show you, and to ask your opinion upon,\""], [323, "Turning over a New Leaf. 319 After that Lady Grace did not feel as if it were of very much consequence that the party was intercepted on their way home by Widow Dent. She would stop the Rector's lady to tell her the last news of her son recovering in the London Hospital, to be discharged cured on Tuesday week, and in the meantime the young couple strolled on before their chaperon. What Lady Grace said to herself was, \"Well, her father won't object. I believe it has been the wish of his heart all along, and he has only put it aside on account of my scruples. My Hugh will not lose his daughter, and so much was taken from him when his sight went ! It is a sadly poor thing for Gracey. Still I believe Mrs. Swift's money will come to Ben eventually \u2014 she has hinted as much to me ; for Prissy will never marry. Of course it is a very different thing for him to be Raby's agent than to be any other man's servant. Raby has made the match possible in more ways than one, as it really Avould not have been in other circumstances. He may put the whole Barton agency into Ben's hand some day, since Mr. Thompson is getting old, and is a bachelor without a son or nephew to succeed him. It is a gocd old fashion revived for the relative of a landlord to act as his agent. I hear Ben's brother has made a very good thing of his land agen cies, though he is in another position under strangers. Ben will represent his wife's kinsman.\" What she said"], [324, "Vashti Savage. 320 to Ben when the engagement was ratified was, \" My dear boy, I don't know what Grace would have done, supposing you had held off any longer, but I should certainly have broken my heart if I had not got you for my son.\" And as she certainly believed AA-hat she said there must have been some truth in it. It was Christmas Eve, and Prissy and Vashti had been out in the porch listening to the waits, when Vashti said, \" So Master Ben is to get his heart's desire, Miss Prissy, after all, and you and me are to look on and rejoice and be ready to help these two poor things as will want our help.\" \" I don't know about that, Vashti,\" said Prissy, laughing, \" but we do rejoice. I never thought to be so happy again, and with reason, for Ben and Gracey have earned their reward.\" \"And we'll get ours \u2014 a deal more than some of us deserved \u2014 all in good time, Miss Prissy. Listen ! there are the waits again.\" \"Hark! the herald-angels sing Glory to the new-born King, Peace on earth, and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled.\" THE END.
