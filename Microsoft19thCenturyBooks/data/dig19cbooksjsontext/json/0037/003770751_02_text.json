CHAPTER I. \"ONE THREAD IN LIFE WORTH SPINNING.\" Vansittart's heart was lighter than it had been for a long time, the day he left Charles Street for Waterloo on his way to Haslemere. He longed to see Eve Marchant, with all a lover's longing, and he told himself that he had tested his own heart severely enough by an absence of three months, and that he had now only to discover whether the lady's heart was in any way responsive to his own. He knew now that his love for Eve Marchant was no passing fancy, no fever of the moment ; and he also told himself that if he could be fairly assured of her worthi- VOL.

Of her father's character, whatever it might be, of her present surroundings, however sordid and shabby, he would take no heed. He would ask only if she were pure and true and frank and honest enough for an honest man's wife. Convinced on that point, he would ask no more. An honest man's wife ? Was he who exacted absolute truth in her verily an honest man? Was he going to give her truth in exchange for truth? Was there nothing that he must needs hold back ; no secret in his past life that he must keep till his life's end? Yes, there was one secret. He was not going to tell her of his Venetian adventure. It would grieve her woman's heart too much to know that the man she loved had to bear the burden of another man's blood. Nay, more, with a woman's want of logic she might deem that impulse of a moment murder, and might refuse to give herself to a man who bore that stain upon his past. He meant to keep his secret. He could trust Lisa not to betray him. She and her kinswoman had pledged themselves to silence; and over"], [11, "\" ONE THREAD IN LIFE WORTH SPINNING.\" 3 \u2022and above the obligation of that promise he had bound them both to him by his services, had made their lives in some wise dependent on his own welfare. No, he had no fear of treachery from them. Nor had he any fear of what the chances of time and change might bring upon him from any other belongings of the dead man \u2014 so evidently had his been one of those isolated existences which drop out of life unlamented and unremembered. He was safe on all sides, he told himself ; and the one lie in his life, the lie which he began when he told his mother that he had not been to Venice, must be main tained steadily, whatever conscience might urge against it. Easter came late this year, and April, the sunny, the showery, the capricious, was flinging her restless lights and shadows over the meadows and copses as he drove from the station. He had to pass Fernhurst on his way to Redwold Towers, and it was yet early in the afternoon as he drove past the quaint little cottage post office in the dip of the hill, the tiny grave yard on the higher ground, the church and parsonage. It was early enough for afternoon-"], [12, "4 THE VENETIANS. tea, and he had no need to hurry to Redwold. His sister had sent a groom with a dog-cart instead of coming to meet him in her capacious landau, a lack of attention for which he thanked her heartily, since it left him his own master. He would have been less than human if he had not stopped at the Homestead, and being in his present frame of mind very human, he pulled up the eager homeward-going horse at the little wooden gate, and flung the reins to the groom. \" I am going to make a call here ; wait five minutes, and if I am not out by that time take the horse to the inn and put him up for an hour.\" \" Yes, sir. How lightly his feet mounted the steep garden path between the trim box borders. There were plenty of flowers in the garden now \u2014 sweet smelling hyacinths, vivid scarlet tulips with wide open chalices, half full of rain ; a snowy mes philus flinging about its frail white blooms in the soft west wind ; a crimson rhododondron making a blaze of colour. The long, low cottage, with its massive porch, was covered with flowering creepers, yellow"], [13, "\" ONE THREAD IN LIFE WORTH SPINNING.\" 5 jasmine, pale pink japonica, scented white honey suckle. The cottage looked like a bower, and seemed to smile at him as he went up the path. He had a childish fancy that he would rather live in that cottage with Eve for his wife than at Merewood, which was one of the prettiest and most convenient houses of moderate size in all Hampshire. What dwelling could ever be so dear as this quaint old cottage, bent under the burden of its disproportionate thatch, with lattice windows peeping out at odd levels, and with dormers like gigantic eyes under overhanging brows. She was at home, everybody was at home, even that rare bird of undomestic habits, the Colonel. They were all at tea in their one spacious parlour \u2014 windows open, and all the perfume of flowers and growing hedgerows and budding trees blowing into the room. Colonel Marchant welcomed him with marked cordiality. The girls were evidently pleased at his coming. \" How good of you to call on us on your way from the station,\" said Sophy. \" Lady Hartley told us you were to be met by the afternoon train.\""], [14, "6 THE VENETIANS. Lo, a miracle ! The five Miss Marchants were all dressed alike \u2014 severely, in darkest blue serge. The red Garibaldis, the yellow and brown stripes, the scarlet, the magenta, the Reckitt's blue, which had made their sitting-room a feast of crude colour, had all vanished. Severe in darkest serge, with neat white linen collars, the Miss Marchants stood before him, a family to whose attire the most fastidious critic could take no objection. Eve was the most silent of the sisters, but she had blushed vividly at his advent, and she was blushing still. She blushed at every word he addressed to her, and seemed to find a painful difficulty in managing the teapot and cups and saucers when she resumed her post at the tea tray. Vansittart asked them for the news of the neighbourhood. How had they managed to amuse themselves after the frost, when there was no more skating ? \"We were awfully sorry,\" said Sophy, \"but the hunting men were awfully glad.\" \" And had you any more balls ? \" \" No public ball \u2014 but there were a good many"], [15, "\" ONE THREAD IN LIFE WORTH SPINNING.\" 7 dances,\" with half a sigh. \" Lady Hartley gave one just before Lent, the only one to which we were invited, and I am happy to say it was out and away the best.\" \"Lady Hartley has been more than kind to us,\" said Eve, finding speech at last. \" She is the most perfectly charming woman I met. You must be very proud of such a sister.\" \"I am proud to know that you like her,\" answered Vansittart, in a low voice. He was sitting at her elbow, helping her by handing the cups and saucers, and very conscious that her hand trembled when it touched his. \" My daughter is right,\" said the Colonel, with a majestic air ; \" Lady Hartley is the one lady in this neighbourhood \u2014 the one womanly woman. She saw my girls snubbed or ignored, and she has made it her business to convince her neighbours that they are a little too good for such treat ment. Other people have been very ready to follow her lead.\" \" Oh, but it's not for that we care. It is Lady Hartley's friendship we value, not her influence on other people,\" protested Eve eagerly. \" We are going to Redwold to-morrow after-"], [16, "8 THE VENETIANS. noon,\" said Jenny ; \" but I don't suppose we shall see you, Mr. Vansittart. You will be shooting, or fishing, or something.\" \" Shooting there is none, Miss Vansittart. The pheasants are a free and unfettered company in the copses, among the primroses and dog-violets. Man is no longer their enemy. And I never felt the angler's passion since I fished for stickle backs in the shrubbery at home.\" The Colonel chimed in at this point, as if thinking the conversation too childish. He began to discuss the political situation \u2014 the chances of a by-election which was to come on directly after Easter. He expressed himself with the ferocity of an old-fashioned Tory. He would give no quarter to the enemy. He had just returned from Paris, he told Vansittart, and had seen what it was to live under a mob- ocracy. \"They have been obliged to shut up one of their theatres \u2014 cut short the run of the finest play that has been produced in the last decade, simply because their sans culottes object to any disparagement of Robespierre. There are a dozen incipient Robespierres in Paris at this"], [17, "9 \" ONE THREAD IN LIFE WORTH SPINNING.\" day, I believe, only waiting for opportunity to burst into full bloom.\" He had been to Paris, then, thought Vansittart. He could afford to take his pleasure in that holiday capital, while his daughters were kept on short commons at Fernhurst. \" Was Paris very full ? \" asked Vansittart. \" I don't know about that. I met a good many people I know. One meets more Englishmen than Parisians on the boulevards at this season. April is the Englishman's month. Your neighbour, Mr. Sefton, was at the Continental \u2014 in point of fact, he and I went to Paris together.\" This explained matters to Vansittart. No doubt Sefton paid the bills for both travellers. \" Mr. Sefton is not a neighbour of mine, but of my sister's,\" he said. \" My father and his father were'good friends before I was born, but I know nothing of this gentleman.\" \" A mutual loss,\" replied the Colonel. \" Sefton is a very fine fellow, as I told you the last time you were here. You can hardly fail to get on with him when you do make his acquaintance.\" \" I saw him at the hunt ball, and 1 must con fess that I was not favourably impressed by his manner.\""], [18, "10 THE VENETIANS. \"Sefton's manner is the worst part of him,\" conceded Colonel Marchant. \"He has been spoilt by Dame Fortune, and is inclined to be arrogant. An only child, brought up in the assurance of future wealth, and taught by a very foolish mother to believe that a landed estate and a fine income constitute a kind of royalty. Sefton might easily be a worse fellow than he is. For my own part, I cannot speak too warmly of him. He has been a capital neighbour, the best neighbour we had, until Lady Hartley was good enough to take a fancy to my girls.\" \" I hope you don't compare Lady Hartley with Mr. Sefton, father,\" cried the impulsive Hetty. \" There is more kindness in a cup of tea from Lady Hartley than in all the game, and fruit, and trout, and things with which Mr. Sefton loads us.\" \" They are enthusiasts, these girls of mine,\" said the Colonel, blandly. \" Lady Hartley has made them her creatures.\" \" Her name reminds me that I must be moving on,\" said Vansittart. \"I hope you will all for give this invasion. I was anxious to learn how you all were. It seems a long time since I was in this part of the world.\""], [19, "11 \"ONE THREAD IN LIFE WORTH SPINNING.\" \" It is a long time,\" said Eve, almost involun tarily. Those few words rejoiced his heart. They sounded like a confession that she had missed him and regretted him, since those long friendly walks and talks in the clear cold January after noons. He had never in all their conversation spoken to her in the words of a lover, but he had shown her that he liked her society, and it might be that she had thought him cold and cowardly when he left her without any token of warmer feeling than this casual friendship of the roads, lanes, and family tea-table. To go away, and stay away for three months, and make no sign 1 A cruel treatment, if, if, in those few familiar hours, he had touched her girlish heart by the magnetic power of his unacknowledged love. He left the Homestead happy in the thought that she was not indifferent to the fact of his existence ; that he was something more to her than a casual acquaintance. He was to see her next day ; and it would be his own fault if he did not see her the day after that; and the next, and the next; until the solemn question had been asked, and the low-"], [20, "THE VENETIANS. 12 breathed answer had been given, and she was his own for ever. All was in his own hand now. He had but to satisfy himself upon one point \u2014 her acquaintance with Sefton, what it meant, and how far it had gone \u2014 and then the rest was peace, the perfect peace of happy and con fiding love. He was unfilial enough to be glad that his mother was not at Redwold. There would be no restraining influence, no maternal arm stretched out to pluck him from his fate. He would be free to fulfil his destiny; and when the fair young bride was won, it would be easy for her to win her own way into that loving, motherly heart. Mrs. Vansittart was not a woman to withhold her affection from her son's wife. Lady Hartley appeared in the portico as the cart drove up to the door. \" What a fright you have given me ! \" she said. \" Did anything happen to the train ? \" \" Nothing but what usually happens to trains.\" \" But you are an hour late.\" \" I called on Colonel Marchant on my way. It never occurred to me that you could be uneasy on my account, or, of course, I should have come"], [21, "\u2022' ONE THREAD IN LIFE WORTH SPINNING.\" 13 on straight. I am very sorry, my dear Maud,\" he concluded, as he kissed her in the hall. \" You are not cured of your infatuation, Jack.\" \" Not cured, or likely to be cured, in your way. I have heard nothing but your praises, Maud, You seem to have been a kind of fairy godmother to those motherless girls.\" \" Have I not ? How did you like their appear ance ? Did you see any improvement ? \" \"A monstrous improvement. They were all neatly dressed, and in one colour.\" \" That was all my doing, Jack.\" \" Really ! But how did you manage it, without wounding their feelings ? \" \" My tact, Jack, my exquisite tact,\" cried Maud, gaily- They were in her morning-room by this time, and Vansittart sank into a low armchair, pre pared to hear all she had to tell. Maud had generally a great deal to say to her brother after an interval of severance. \"I'll tell you all about it,\" she began. \"It grieved me to see those poor girls in their coats of many colours, or rathei in their assemblage of colours among the five sisters, so I felt I must do"], [22, "THE VENETIANS. 14 something. I was always looking at them, and thinking how much better I could dress them than they dressed themselves, and quite as economically, mark you. So one day I said casually that I thought sisters \u2014 youthful sisters understood \u2014 looked to particular advantage when they were all dressed exactly alike, whereupon Eve, who is candour itself\" \u2014 Vansittart's heart thrilled at this praise \u2014 \" declared herself entirely ef my opinion, but she explained that she and her sisters had very little money to dress upon, and they were all great bargain-hunters, and could get most wonderful bargains in stuffs and silks for their frocks at the great drapery sales, if they were not particular in their choice of colours. ' And that is how we always look like a ragged regiment,' said Eve, ' but we certainly get good value for our poor little scraps of money.' \" \" A girl who ought to be dressed like a duchess,\" sighed Vansittart. \"Well, on this I read her one of my lay sermons. I told her that so far from getting good value for her money, she got very bad value for her money ; that she and her sisters, in their thirst for stuff at a shilling a yard, reduced from"], [23, "\" ONE THREAD IN LIFE WORTH SPINNING.\" 15 three and sixpence, made themselves in a manner queens of shreds and patches. She was very ready to admit the force of my reasoning, poor child. And then she pleaded that her sisters were so young \u2014 they had no control over their feelings when they found themselves in a great drapery show. It seemed a kind of fairyland, where things were being given away. And then such a scramble, she tells me, women almost fighting with each other for eligible bits of stuff and last season's finery. I told her that I had hardly ever seen the inside of a big shop, and that I hated shopping. ' What,' she cried, ' you who are rich ! I thought you would enjoy it above all things.' I told her no ; that Lewis or Redfern sent me one of his people, and I chose my gown from his pattern book, and his fitter came and tried it on, and I had no more trouble about it ; or that I went to my dressmaker, and just looked over her newest things in a quiet drawing-room, without any of the distracting bustle of a great shop.\" \"My sweetest Maud, what a dear little snob she must have thought you.\" \"I don't think she did. She seemed pleased"], [24, "16 THE VENETIANS. to know my ways. And then I told her that I should like to see her and her sisters all dressed alike, in one of my favourite colours ; and then I told her that I knew of a most meritorious family \u2014 invented that moment \u2014 who were going to Australia, and whom I wanted to help. ' In a colony, those bright colours your sisters wear would be most suitable,' I said. ' Will you make an exchange with me \u2014 just in a friendly way give me as many of your bright gowns as you can spare, and I will give you a piece of good serge and a piece of the very best cloth in exchange ? ' \" \" Did she stand that ? \" asked Vansittart, \"Not very well. She looked at me for a moment or two, blushed furiously, and then got up and walked to the window7, and stood there with her back towards me. I knew that she was crying. I went over to her and put my arm round her neck and kissed her as if she had been my own kith and kin. I begged her to forgive me if I had offended. ' I really want to help those poor girls who are going to Melbourne,' I said ; ' and your bargains would be just the thing for them. They could get nothing half as"], [25, "17 \" ONE THREAD IN LIFE WORTH SPINNING.\" good for the same money.' I felt ashamed of myself the next moment. I had lied so well that she believed me.\" \" Never mind, Maud ; the motive was virtuous.\" \" ' No, they couldn't,' she said ; ' not till next July. The sales are all over.' And tnen, after a little more argument, she yielded, and it was agreed that I should drive over to the Home stead next morning, and she and her sisters and I would hold a review of their frocks and furbe lows, and whatever was suitable for my Australian emigrants I should take from them, giving them fair value in exchange. Eve stipulated that it should be only fair value. Well, the review was capital fun. The girls were charming \u2014 evidently proud of their finery, expatiating upon the miraculous cheapness of this and that, and the genuineness of the sales at the best houses. They had sales on the brain, I think. Of course I left them all the gay frocks suitable for home evenings ; but I swooped like a vulture on their outdoor finery. I had taken a large portmanteau over with me, and it was crammed as full as it would hold with frocks and fichus and Zouave jackets for my Australians. I am sorry to say vol. n. c"], [26, "18 THE VENETIANS. the portmanteau is still upstairs in the box-room. And now, Jack, you know the history of the serge frocks.\" \"You are a dear little diplomatist; but I'm afraid you must have made Miss Marchant suffer a good deal before your transmutation was accomplished.\" \" My dear Jack, that girl is destined for suffer ing \u2014 of that kind ; small social stings, the sense of the contrast between her surroundings and those of other girls no better born, only better off.\" \" She will marry and forget these evil days,\" said Vansittart. \" Let us hope so ; but let us hope that she will not marry you.\" \" Why should you \u2014 or any one \u2014 hope that ? \" \" Because it ain't good enough, Jack ; believe me, it ain't. She is a very sweet girl \u2014 but her father's character is the very opposite of sweet. Hubert has made inquiries, and has been told, by men on whose good faith he can rely, that the Colonel is a black-leg ; that there is hardly any dishonourable act that a man can do, short of felony, which Colonel Marchant has not done. He is well known in London, where he spends"], [27, "\"ONE THREAD IN LIFE WORTH SPINNING.\" 19 the greater part of his time. He is a hanger-on of rich young men. He shows them life. He wins their money \u2014 and like that other hanger-on, the leech, he drops away from them when he is gorged and they are empty. Can you choose the daughter of such a man for your wife ? \" \" I can, and do choose her, above all other women ; and if she is, in herself, as pure and true as I believe her to be, I shall ask her to be my wife. The more disreputable her father, the more it shall be my glory and delight to take her away from him \" \"And when her father is your father-in-law how will you deal with him ? \" \" Leave that social problem to me. I am not an idiot, or a youth fresh from the University. I shall know how to meet the difficulty.\" \"You will not have that man at Merewood, Jack,\" cried Maud, excitedly, \" to loaf about my mother's garden \u2014 the garden that is hers now \u2014 and to play cards in my mother's drawing-room ? \" \" You are running on very fast, Maud. No ; if I marry Eve Marchant be assured I shall not keep open house for her father. He has not been so good a father as to make his claim indisputable.\""], [28, "20 THE VENETIANS. \" Such a marriage will break mother's heart, sighed Maud. \"You know better than that, Maud! You know that only a disreputable marriage would seriously distress my mother, and there can be nothing disreputable in a marriage with a good and pure-minded girl. I promise you that I will not offer myself to Eve Marchant until I feel assured of her perfect truth. There is only one point upon which I have the shadow of a doubt. It seemed to me, from certain trifling indications, that there had been some kind of flirtation be tween her and Sefton.\" \" I cannot quite make that out, Jack,\" answered Maud, thoughtfully. \" I have seen them together several times since you left. There is certainly something, on his side. He pursues her in a manner \u2014 contrives to place himself near her at every opportunity, and puts on a confidential air when he talks to her. I have watched them closely in her interest, for I really am fond of her in any capacity: except as a sister-in-law. I don't think she encourages him. Indeed I be lieve she dislikes him ; but she is not as stand offish as she might be ; and I have seen her"], [29, "\" ONE THREAD IN LIFE WORTH SPINNING.\" 21 occasionally talking very confidentially with him as if they had a secret understanding.\" \" That's it,\" cried Vansittart, inwardly raging. \" There is a secret, and I must be possessed of that secret before I confess my love.\" \"And how do you propose to pluck out the heart of the mystery ? \" \" In the simplest manner \u2014 by questioning Eve herself. If she is the woman I think her she will answer me truthfully. If she is false and shifty \u2014 why then \u2014 I whistle her down the wind, and you will never hear more of this fond dream of mine.\" \" Well, Jack, you must go your own way. You were always my master, and I can't pretend to master you now. You'll have an opportunity of seeing Eve and Mr. Sefton to-morrow. He is coming to my afternoon. I hope you'll be civil to him.\" \" As civil as I can. I'll break no bounds, Maud ; but I believe the man to be a scoundrel. If he were pursuing Eve with any good motive he would have spoken out before now.\" \" Precisely my view of the case. It is shame ful to compromise her by motiveless attentions."], [30, "22 THE VENETIANS. There goes the gong. I am glad we have had this quiet talk. You will not act precipitately, will you, Jack ? \" concluded his sister, appealingly, as she moved towards the door. \"I will act as I have said, Maud, not other- >? wise. \" Well,\" with a sigh, \" I believe she will come through the ordeal, and that I am destined to have her for my sister.\" \" You have made her love you already. That leaves less work for you in the future.\" \" Poor mother ! She will be wofully disap pointed.\" \" True,\" said Vansittart ; \" but as I couldn t marry all her protegees, perhaps it is just as well I should marry none of them ; and be assured I should not love Eve Marchant if I didn't believe that she would be a good and loving daughter to my mother.\" \" Every lover believes as much. It is all nonsense,\" said Maud, as she ran off to her dressing-room. Mr. Sefton made an early appearance at Lady Hartley's afternoon. He arrived before the Mar chants, and when there were only about a dozen"], [31, "\" ONE THREAD IN LIFE WORTH SPINNING.\" 23 people in the long drawing-room, and Vansittart guessed by the way he hung about the windows that looked towards the drive that he was on the watch for the coming of the sisters. Lady Hartley introduced her brother to Mr. Sefton, with the respect due to the owner of one of the finest estates in the county, a man of old family and aristocratic connections. Sefton was particularly cordial, and began to make conversa tion in the most amiable way, a man not renowned for making himself amiable to his equals. The Miss Marchants were announced while he and Vansittart were talking, and Mr. Sefton's attention began to wander immediately, although he con tinued the discussion of hopes and fears about that by-election which was disturbing every politician's mind ; or which at any rate served as a subject for talk among people who had nothing to say to each other. Only two out of the three grown-up sisters appeared, Eve and Jenny. They had too much discretion to appear too often as a triplet. Sefton broke away from the conversation at the first opening, and went straight to Eve, who was talking to little Mr. Tivett, who arrived that"], [32, "24 THE VENETIANS. afternoon, no holidays being complete in a country house without such a man as Tivett, with his little thin voice, good nature, and willingness to fetch and carry for the weaker sex. Vansittart stood aloof for a little while, talk ing to a comfortable matron, who was evidently attached to the landed interest, as her conversa tion dwelt upon the weather in its relation to agriculture and the lambing season. He could see that Eve received Mr. Sefton's advances with coldest politeness. On her part there was no touch of that eagerness, that confidential air which had so distressed him that afternoon by the lake. She talked with him for a few minutes, and then turned away, and walked into the adjoining room, where the wide French window stood open to the garden. Vansittart seized his opportunity and followed her. He found her with her sister, looking at a pile of new books on a large table in a corner, and he speedily persuaded them that the flower-beds outside were better worth looking at than magazines and books which were no less ephemeral than the tulips and hyacinths. He walked up and down the terrace with them for nearly half an hour, but never a hint of"], [33, "'\u2022 ONE THREAD IN LIFE WORTH SPINNING.\" 25 anything more than lightest society talk gave he in all that time. He had made up his mind to speak only after gravest deliberation, only in the calmest hour, when they two should be alone together under God's quiet sky; but he so managed matters that Mr. Sefton had no further opportunity of offering his invidious attentions to Eve Marchant that afternoon. It was Van sittart who found seats for her and her sister in the drawing-room ; it was Vansittart who carried their teacups, only assisted by Mr. Tivett, who tripped about with plates of chocolate biscuits, and buttered buns, with such activity as to appear ubiquitous. The next day was Good Friday, a day of long church services and no visitors. On Saturday Vansittart went to Liss to spend the day with his mother, and to make a tour of inspection of grounds and home farm, a tour which the mother and son took together, and during which they talked of many things, but not of Eve Marchant. If Mrs. Vansittart wondered that her son should have chosen to spend the recess at Redwold rather than at Merewood, she was too discreet to express either wonder or dissatisfaction. She was"], [34, "26 THE VENETIANS. going to Charles Street directly after Easter, and Jack was to join her there for the London season ; so she had no ground for dolefulness in being deprived of his society for just this one week. She found him looking well, and, to her fancy, happier than he had looked for a long time. There was an old ring of gaiety in his voice and laugh which she had missed of late years, and which she heard again to-day. They lunched together, and she drove him to the station in the late afternoon. \" It delights me to see you looking so well and so happy, Jack,\" she said, as they walked up and down the platform. \" Does it, mother ? \" he asked earnestly. \" Is my happiness really enough to gladden you? Are you content that I should be happy in my own way ? \" Her answer lingered for a little, and then she said gravely, \" Yes, Jack, I am content, for I cannot believe that your way would be a foolish way. You have seen enough of the world to judge between gold and dross, and you are not the kind of man to plunge wilfully into a morass, led by false lights.\""], [35, "\" ONE THREAD IN LIFE WORTH SPINNING.\" 27 \" No, no, mother, you may be sure of that. My star shall be a true star \u2014 no Jack o'Lantern.\" The train steamed in opportunely, and cut short the conversation ; but enough had been said, Vansittart thought, to break the ice ; and it was evident to him that his mother had an inkling of the course which events were taking. The next day was Easter Sunday, a day of gladness, a day when the morning sun is said to dance upon the waters ; a day when the dawn seems more glorious, when the flowers that deck the churches seem fairer than mere earthly flowers, when the swelling chords of the organ and the voices even of the village choir have a sweetness that suggests the heavenly chorus. To John Vansittart, at least, among those who worshipped in the village church that Easter Day, there seemed a gladness in all things \u2014 a pure and thrilling gladness as of minds attuned to holiness and ready to believe. He had read much of that new and widening school of thought which is gradually sapping the old foundations and pulling down the old bulwarks ; but there was no remembrance of that modern school in his mind to-day as he stood up in the village"], [36, "28 THE VENETIANS. church to join in the Easter hymn. His thoughts had resumed the simplicity of early years. He was able to believe and to pray like a little child. He prayed to be forgiven for that unpre meditated sin of which the world knew not. He prostrated himself in heart and mind at the feet of the Christ who died for sinners. But he did not go to the Altar. The Easter Communion was not for him whose hands were stained with blood. The Marchants were at the morning service, all five of them, fresh and blooming after their long walk, a bunch of English roses, redder or paler as Nature had painted each.

The service was brief, a service of jubilant hymns and anthem and short flowery sermon, flowery as the chancel and altar, and pulpit and font, in all their glory of arums, azaleas, spireas, and lilies of the valley. The church clock was striking twelve as the major part of the con gregation poured out. There was a row of carriages in the road, two of them from Redwold Towers ; but Vansittart and Tivett declined the accommodation of landau or waggonette. \" We are going for a long walk,\" said Mr. Tivett. \" It's such a perfect day.\" \" But you will lose your lunch, if you go too far.\" \" We must risk that, and make amends at afternoon-tea.\" \"Tivett,\" said Vansittart, when the carriages had driven off, \" I am going to make a martyr of you.

All around them rippled the sea of furze and heather, broken by patches of woodland, and grassy glades that were like bits stolen out of the New Forest, and flung down here upon this swelling hillside. Here and there a squatter's cottage, with low cob wall and steep tiled roof, stood snug and sheltered in its bit of garden, under the shadow of a venerable beech or oak \u2014 here and there a little knot of children sprawled and sunned themselves in front of a cottage door. The rest was silence and solitude, save for the voices of those rare birds which inhabit forest and common land. \" Gussie,\" whispered Vansittart, when they had passed one of these humble homesteads, and were ascending the crest of the hill, \" do you think you could contrive to lose yourself \u2014 and the girls \u2014 for half an hour ? \" \" Of course I can. You will have to cooey for us when you want to see our faces again.\" This little conversation occurred in the rear of the five girls, who had scattered themselves over the hillside, every one believing in her own par ticular track as the briefest and best ascent."], [41, "\" ONE THREAD IN LIFE WORTH SPINNING.\" 33 Eve had climbed highest of all the sisters, by a path so narrow, and so hemmed in by bramble and hawthorn, that only one, and that one a dexterous climber, could mount at a time. Vansittart followed her desperately, pushing aside the brambles with his stick. He was breathless when he reached the top, where she stood lightly poised, like Mercury. The ascent, since he stopped to speak to Tivett, had taken only ten minutes or so, but when he looked round him and downward over the billowy furze and broken rugged hillside there was not one vestige of Augustus Tivett or the four Miss Marchants in view. \" What can have become of them all ? \" ques tioned Eve, gazing wonderingly around. \"I thought they were only just behind me \u2014 I heard them talking and laughing a few minutes ago.

In front of them, far away towards the south stretched the Sussex Downs, purple in the distance, save for one pale shimmering streak of light which meant the sea.

But for Vansittart that world hardly existed. He had eyes, thoughts, comprehension for nothing but this girl who sat mutely at his side, the graceful throat bending a little, the soft, shy violet eyes looking at the ground. So far there had been no word of love between them, not one word, not one silent indication, such as the tender pressure of hands, or even the looks that tell love's story. But love was in the air they breathed, love held them and bound them each to each, and each knew the other's unspoken secret. \" Miss Marchant,\" began Vansittart with cere monious gravity, \" will you forgive me if I ask you a few questions which may seem somewhat impertinent on my part?\" This was so different from what her trembling heart had expected that she paled as at a sudden danger. He was watching her intently, and was quick to perceive that pallor. \"I don't think you would ask me anything really impertinent,\" she faltered. \" Not with an impertinent motive, be assured."], [44, "36 THE VENETIANS.

He has even offered Sophy and me his horses to ride \u2014 to have the exclusive use of two of his best hacks, if father would let us ride them ; but of course that was out of the question. We could not have accepted such a favour from any one.\" \" Not from any one but an affianced lover,\" said Vansittart. \" Do you know, Miss Marchant, when I first saw you and Mr. Sefton together at the ball I thought you must be engaged.\" \" How very foolish of you.\" \" He had such an air of taking possession of you, as if he had a superior claim to your attentions.\" \" Oh, that is only Mr. Sefton's masterful way.

I heard, accidentally, some few words which Mr. Sefton spoke to you, while you were walking with him by the lake; and those words implied a secret understanding between you and him \u2014 something of deep interest of which the outer world knew nothing. Be frank with me, for pity's sake. Speak openly to me to-day, from heart to heart, if you never speak to me again. Is not there something more between you and Wilfred Sefton than an everyday friendship ? \" \" Yes,\" she answered, \" there is something more. There is a secret understanding \u2014 not much of a secret, but Mr. Sefton has taken advantage of it to offer me meaningless attentions which I detest, and which, I dare say, ill-natured people may talk about.

Poor Sophy hankers after the pomps and vanities of this wicked world.\" Her gaiety delighted her lover. It told of an unburdened conscience \u2014 a heart at peace with itself. \"Tell me what it was you overheard, Mr. Eavesdropper, that afternoon by the lake ? \" she asked. \" I heard him say to you, very earnestly, ' It was a false scent, you see;' and then he expressed his sorrow for your disappointment.\" \" You have a good memory.

He said he had been slow to speak about him, as he knew that he must be in some measure under a cloud.

I told Mr. Sefton how unhappy I was about Harold, and my fear \u2014 a growing fear \u2014 that he must be dead. He argued me out of this terror, and told me that when a man who was leading a wild life far away from home once became neglectful of his home obligations and let a long time slip without writing, the probabilities were that he would leave off writing altogether. His experience had shown him that this was almost a certainty7. And then, seeing how distressed I was, he promised that he would try and find out Harold's where abouts. He told me that the newspaper press and the electric cable had made the world a very small world, and that he certainly ought to be able to trace my brother's wanderings, and bring me some information about him.\""], [51, "\"ONE BORN TO LOVE YOU, SWEET.\" 43 \" And did he succeed ? \" \" No ; he failed always in getting any certain knowledge of Harold's wanderings, though he did bring me some scraps of information about his adventures in Mashonaland; but that was all news of past weeks \u2014 ever so long ago. He could hear nothing about Harold in the present \u2014 not within the last four years \u2014 so there was very little comfort in his discoveries. Last November he told me that he had heard of a man at the diamond fields whose description seemed exactly to fit my brother, and he thought this time he was on the right track. He wrote to an agent at Cape Town, and took every means of putting himself in communication with this man \u2014 both through the agent and by advertisements in the local papers \u2014 and the result was disappointment.

Would either of these two souls ever know such perfect bliss again \u2014 the bliss of loving and being loved, while love was still a new thing ?

Tivett and the four girls came toiling towards her. \"Mr. Tivett has taken us a most awful round,\" cried Hetty. \" He pretended to know the way, and he doesn't know it one little bit.\" \" My dear young lady,\" apologized the gentle Tivett, \" the truth of the matter is that I trusted to my natural genius for topography, for I have never been on Bexley Hill before.\" \"And you pretended to pilot us, and have only led us astray.\" \" Alas ! sweet child, the world is full of such pilots.\" \" Shall I tell them ? \" whispered Vansittart, at Eve's ear. \" If you like.

Can you ever put up with so many sisters-in law?\" \"I would put up with them if you had as many sisters as Hypermnestra ; \" and then, laugh ing happily, he told these four girls that they were soon to have a sister less and a brother more. Hetty and Peggy received the news with whooping and clapping of hands, Sophy and Jenny with polite surprise. Was there ever anything so wonderful? Nothing could have been further from their thoughts. Little Mr. Tivett skipped and frisked like a young lamb in a meadow. Had Eve Marchant been his sister he could hardly have shown more delight. The descent of the hill for Eve and Vansittart was a progress through pure ether. They knew not that their feet touched the earth. They were like the greater gods and goddesses in the Homeric Olympus. They started and they arrived. The labour of common mortals was not for them. \"Do you remember the legend of the blue flower of happiness which grows upon the mountain peak, and is said to fade and wither in the lower air ? \" asked Vansittart, close at his fiancee's ear. \" We have found the blue flower"], [55, "\"ONE BORN TO LOVE YOU, SWEET.\" 47 on the hilltop, Eve. God grant that for us the heaven-born blossom will keep its bloom even on the dull level of daily life.\" \" Will our life be dull ? \" she questioned, in her shy sweet voice, as if she scarcely dared speak of her love louder than in a whisper. \" I don't think I can ever find life dull so long as you really care for me.\" \" No, Eve, life shall not be dull. It shall be as bright and varied, and as full of change and gladness, as devoted love can make it.

Years hence, when you begin to be tired of me, and the blue flower takes a greyish shade, why, we can change the scene of our lives, wander far away, and in a new world I shall seem almost a new lover.\" \" Will you ever take me to Italy ? \" she asked. \"Italy has been the dream of my life, but I never thought it would be realized.\" \"Ah, that is just a girl's fancy, fed by old fashioned poets \u2014 Byron, for instance. The Italy7 of to-day is very disappointing, and just like everywhere else.\" \" Oh, Mr. Vansittart ! \" \" Mr. ! \" he echoed. \" Henceforward I am John, or Jack ; very soon, my husband.

To Vansittart also the sound was sweet, spoken by those lips. Colonel Marchant received Mr. Vansittart's offer for his eldest daughter politely, but with no excess of cordiality. He had set his hope upon a richer marriage, had encouraged Sefton's visits to the Homestead, with the idea that he would eventually propose to Eve. He might not mean matrimony in the first instance, per haps, though he obviously admired the young lady, but he would be led on and caught before he was aware. Colonel Marchant had implicit faith in his daughter's power to ward off any evil purpose of her admirer ; and although he knew Sefton's character well enough to know that he would not willingly marry a penniless girl, he trusted to the power of Eve's beauty and VOL.

He was too shrewd a campaigner, however, to refuse the humble sparrow in the hand for the goldfinch in the bush. Sefton had been dangling about the family for nearly two years, and had scrupulously abstained from any serious declaration ; and here was a young man of good birth and breeding, with a very fair estate, who between January and April had made up his mind in the manliest fashion, and was willing to take Eve for his wife without a sixpence, and to settle three hundred a year upon her by way of pin money. Vansittart had offered himself in a frank and business-like manner, had declared the amount of his income, and his anxiety to marry as soon as possible. \" We have nothing in this world to wait for,\" he said. \" Except a young lady's caprice,\" answered the Colonel. \" Eve will be too happy in the pleasures of courtship to be anxious for the final step. And then there will be her trousseau to prepare. That will take time.\" \" My mother can help her in all those details,\""], [59, "\"ONE BORN TO LOVE YOU, SWEET.\" 51 said Vansittart, thinking that in all probability his mother would have to pay for as well as to choose the wedding finery. \" We can take all that trouble off your hands, Colonel Marchant.\" His mother ! He had yet to tell her that his fate was decided \u2014 his life companion chosen. There had been some hint of what was coming in their brief talk at the railway station. He wrote to his mother on Sunday night, when his sister's household and guests were hushed in their first sleep ; wrote at fullest length, dwelling fondly upon the graces and perfections of her whom he had chosen ; assuring and re-assuring his mother that the choice was a wise one. \" She will love you dearly, if you will let her,\" he wrote ; \" she will be to you as a second daughter \u2014 nearer to you, perhaps, than Maud can now be ; for, if you will have it so, our lives may be spent mostly together, in a triple bond of love. I know not what your inclination may be, but for my own part I see no reason why we should not live together as one family.

Strange, cruel, that the scene of his dreams should be Venice, where he and Eve were wandering confusedly, now on land, now on sea, greatly troubled by petty disturbances, and con tinually losing each other in labyrinthine streets and on slimy sea-washed stairs. Stranger still that Venice should be unlike Venice, and indeed unlike any place he had ever seen in his life. The dream was but a natural sequence of Eve's talk about Italy. It had hurt him that one of her first utterances after their betrothal should express her desire to visit a land whose frontier he would never willingly cross again. He had loved Italy with all his heart ; but now the image of Venice burnt and festered in his mind like a plague spot on the breast of a man in full health.

At such a time as this the dumpiest damsel of the pug-nosed milkmaid type is as fair as she who brought slaughter and burning upon Troy ; but for Vansittart's abject condition there was the extenuating circumstance of undeniable beauty, and a charm of manner which even village gossip had never disputed. The young ladies who condemned the Miss Mar chants en bloc as \" bad style \" had been fain to confess that Eve had winning ways, which made one almost forgive her cheap boots and mended gloves. Vansittart was happy.

It would be well that you should know all that is to be known about him before he is your brother-in law ; so as to avoid unpleasant surprises in the future.\" Happily the idea of this brother's existence was already familiar. In their very first ramble together as engaged lovers Eve had told Van sittart a great deal about her brother. She dwelt with the younger sister's fond admiration upon his youthful gifts, which seemed to be chiefly of the athletic order ; his riding, his shooting, his rowing, his running : in all which exercises he appeared to have excelled. At Cambridge his chief sins, as Eve knew them, had been tandem driving, riding in steeplechases, with frequent absences at Newmarket. Whatever darker sins had distinguished his college career were but dimly suspected by Eve."], [67, "\"THE TIME OF LOVERS IS BRIEF.\" 59 \" My father was very proud of him while he was quite a boy,\" Eve told her lover, \" but when he grew up, and began to spend money, they were always quarrelling. Poor mother ! It was so sad to see her between them \u2014 loving them both, and trying to be loyal to both; her poor heart torn asunder in the struggle.\" \"And he was fond of you, this brother of yours ? \" questioned Vansittart, to whom such fondness seemed a redeeming virtue. \" Yes, he was very fond of me ; he was always good to me. When there was unhappiness in the dining-room and drawing-room \u2014 when Harold was what father called sulky \u2014 he used to come to the school-room, and sit over the fire roasting chestnuts all the evening. He would go without his dinner rather than sit down with father, and would have some supper brought to the school room at ten o'clock, and my good old governess and 1 used to share his supper and wait upon him. What merry suppers they were ! I was too thoughtless to consider that his being with us meant bad blood between him and father, and unhappiness for my poor mother.

But I am tiring you with these childish reminiscences.\" \"No, love; there is no detail in your past life so trifling that I would not care to know it. I want to feel as if I had known you from your cradle. We will go to see the old place near Beverley some day, if you like, and you shall show me the gardens where you played, the rooms in which you lived. One can always get into another man's house by a little manage ment.\" That Easter week was a time of loveliest spring weather. Even the sun and the winds were gracious to these happy lovers, and for them April put on the guise of May. Vansittart spent almost all his days at the Homestead, or rambling with the sisters, Eve and he walking side by side, engrossed in each other's company, as if the world held no one else \u2014 the sisters ahead of them or in the rear, as caprice dictated. Everv lane and thicket and hillside between"], [69, "\"THE TIME OF LOVERS IS BRIEF.\" 61 Fernhurst and Blackdown was explored in those happy wanderings ; every pathway in Verdley Copse was trodden by those light footsteps ; and Henley Hill and its old Roman village grew as familiar to Vansittart as Pall Mall and the clubs. They revelled in the primroses which carpeted all those woodland ways ; they found the earliest bluebells, and a hollow which was white as snow with the fairy cups of the wood anemone. One morning, as they were walking over the soft brown carpet of fir needles and withered oak leaves in Verdley Copse, Vansittart opened a little dark-blue velvet box, and showed Eve a ring \u2014 a half-hoop of sapphires set with brilliants. \"I chose the colour in memory of the blue flower of happiness that you and I found on the hilltop,\" he said, as he put the ring on the third finger of his sweetheart's slender hand. \" If ever you are inclined to be angry with me, or to care for me a little less than you do now, let the memory of the mystical blue flower plead for me, Eve, and the thought of how dearly we loved each other that Easter Sunday years and years ago.\" She gave a faint, shuddering sigh at the image those words evoked."], [70, "62 THE VENETIANS. \" Years and years ago ! Will this day when we are young and happy ever be years and years ago ? It seems so strange ! \" \"Age is strange and death is stranger; but they must come, Eve. All we have to hope for and to pray for is that we may go on loving each other to the end.\" After those ramblings in the coppices and over the hill, there was afternoon tea at the Homestead \u2014 a feast for the gods. Colonel Marchant, well content with the progress of affairs, had gone to Brighton for the volunteer review, and was not expected home again till the end of the week ; so the sisters were sovereign rulers of the house, and afternoon tea was the order of the day. It is doubtful whether dinner had any part in the scheme of their existence at this time. The short-petticoated youngsters generally carried some hunks of currant cake in a basket, and these hunks were occasionally shared with the elder sisters, and even with Vansittart, who went without his luncheon day after day, scarcely knowing that he had missed a meal. Then they all tramped home in their muddy boots \u2014 for however blue the sky and however dry the roads"], [71, "\"THE TIME OF LOVERS IS BRIEF.\" 63 there was always plenty of mud in the copses \u2014 and then they all sat round the big loo table to what Hettie called a stodgy tea. Stodgy being interpreted meant a meal of cake and toast, and eggs, and bread and jam, and a succession of teapots. Vansittart only left the Homestead in time to drive back to Redwold to dress for dinner. On the Thursday evening the Miss Marchants who were \" out \" were all bidden to dinner at Redwold, and were to be driven thither by that very fly which had broken down on the crest of the snowy hill. It was a grand occasion, for an invitation to dinner rarely found its way to the Homestead. Cards for garden-parties were the highest form of courtesy to which the Miss Marchants had hitherto been accustomed. And this dinner was to be a solemn affair, for Eve was to appear at it in all the importance of her position as Vansittart's future wife. Mrs. Van sittart was coming from London for a night or two in order to be present at the festivity, which would be in a manner Eve's formal acceptance as a member of the family. It was only on Thursday morning that Van-"], [72, "64 THE VENETIANS. sittart discovered with some vexation that Mr. Sefton had been asked to this family dinner. Sir Hubert had met him, and had invited him in a casual way, having not the faintest idea that his society would be displeasing either to Eve or her lover. The first person Eve's eyes lighted on when she and her sisters entered the drawing room was Mr. Sefton. He was standing near the door, and she had to pass him on her way to her hostess. He stood waiting until Lady Hartley turned to greet the sisters, and then at once took possession of Eve. \" I have to congratulate you. As an old friend I venture to congratulate you most warmly,\" he said, holding her hand, after the inevitable shake-hands of old acquaintances. \" You have done wonderfully well for yourself. It is really a brilliant match.\" \" For me, you mean,\" she said, looking at him with an angry light in her eyes. \" Why don't you finish your sentence, Mr. Sefton, and say, \u2022for you, Miss Marchant, with your disad vantages ' ? \" \" I am sorry I have offended you \" I don't like to be told I have done well for"], [73, "\"THE TIME OF LOVERS IS BRIEF.\" 65 myself. God has given me the love of a good man. If he were not Mr. Vansittart, but Mr. Smith with only a hundred a year, I should be just as happy.\" Vansittart, that moment approaching, overheard the familiar British patronymic. \" What are you saying about Mr. Smith ? \" he asked, remembering how two men, one the slain and the other the slayer, had hidden their identity under that name. \" I was only talking of an imaginary Smith,\" she answered, her face lighting up as she turned to her lover. \" There is no such person.\" \"Come and look at the azaleas,\" said Van sittart ; \" they are worth a visit ; \" and so, after the lover's fashion, he who had only parted from her at six o'clock took her away to the conserva tory at the other end of the room, and absorbed her into a solitude of azaleas and orange trees. Mr. Sefton in the mean while was talking to Mrs. Vansittart, and not having done over well with his congratulation of the future bride now occupied himself in congratulating the elder lady upon the advantage of having secured so charming a daughter-in-law. \" I quite agree with you,\" replied Mrs. Van- vol. n.

He has been good enough to accept any little shooting I have had to offer \u2014 and he and I have seen a good deal of each other. I knew his son before I knew him.

He is one of that numerous family \u2014 the lost tribe of society \u2014 the men who have dropped through.\" \" I don't quite follow you.\" \" My dear Mrs. Vansittart, the less said about Harold Marchant the better. If he is dead the good old saying comes in \u2014 de mortuis. If he is alive I think the less you, or your son, or your daughter-in-law have to do with him the happier it will be for you.\" \" Mr. Sefton, it is not fair to talk to me in this"], [75, "\"THE TIME OF LOVERS IS BRIEF.\" 67 vague strain. I am personally interested in Eve's brother. What do you mean ? \" \" Only what I might mean about a good many young men who have lived within the walls that sheltered Bacon and Newton, Whewell and Macaulay. Harold Marchant's career at Cam bridge was a foolish career. Instead of devoting himself to the higher mathematics he gave himself up to hunting, horse-racing, and other amusements of even a more dangerous order. He had to leave the University hurriedly \u2014 he had to leave the country still more hastily. He has never within my knowledge come back to England. Eve is, or was, passionately attached to him, and to gratify her I have taken a good deal of trouble in trying to find out his present whereabouts and mode of life; but without avail, It is nearly ten years since he left this country. He was then two and twenty years of age. He was last heard of more than five years ago with an exploring party in Mashonaland. He is exactly the kind of young man one would like to hear of in Central Africa, and intending to stay there!\" \" Poor Eve ; how sad for her ! \""], [76, "68 THE VENETIANS. \" But that is all over now. She has a new love, and will soon forget her brother.\" \"I do not think she is so shallow as that.\" \" Not shallow, but intense.\" Dinner was announced at this moment, and Sir Hubert came to offer Mrs. Vansittart his arm. He was to have his mother-in-law on his right hand and Eve on his left, and Mr. Sefton was to sit by his hostess on the other side of the table. This ended the conversation about Harold Marchant, and it was not renewed after dinner."], [77, "69 CHAPTER IV AS A SPIRIT FK0M DREAM TO DREAM. Lady Hartley, once being reconciled to the inevitable, was full of kindness for her brother's future wife. Eve had seen nothing of London and its gaieties, and as the Hartleys had taken a house inBruton Street for the season, it seemed only a natural thing 'to take her up to town with them, and initiate her into some of the pleasures to which her future position would entitle her. \" And when you are married I can present you,\" she told Eve. \" It isn't worth while going through that ordeal till next year. You will have plenty to do between now and midsummer in getting your trousseau ready.\" Eve blushed, and was silent for a few minutes, and then, as she was alone with Lady Hartley in"], [78, "70 THE VENETIANS. the morning room at Redwold, she took courage, and said \u2014 \" I'm afraid my trousseau will be a very small one. I asked my father last night what he could do for me, and he said fifty pounds would be the utmost he could give me. It wouldn't be overmuch if I were going to marry a curate, would it ? \" \" My dearest Eve, fifty pounds will go a long way, as I shall manage things. Remember I am going to be your sister, a real sister, not a sham one, and while we are buying the trousseau your purse and mine shall be one.\" \"Oh, I couldn't allow that. I couldn't let myself sponge upon you. I would rather be married in white alpaca.\" \" My child, you shall not be married in alpaca. And as for sponging upon me, well, if you are so mightily proud you can pay me back every shilling I spend for you, a year or so hence, out of your pin-money.\" \" My pin-money,\" repeated Eve. \" Father told me how generously Mr. Vansittart had offered to settle an income upon me \u2014 upon me who brino him nothing, not even a respectable trousseau.\""], [79, "71 AS A SPIRIT FROM DREAM TO DREAM. \" Now, Eve, I won't hear a word more abcut the trousseau, until we are going about shopping together.\" \"You are too kind, yet I can't help feeling it hard to begin by taxing yonr generosity. Isn't it the custom for the bride to bring the house linen in her trousseau ? \" \" Oh, in bourgeois families no doubt, and with young people just setting up in the world ; but Merewold is very well provided with linen. You can't suppose mother and Jack have lived there without tablecloths or dusters. There is nothing for you to think about, Eve, but your own pretty frocks, and we will think about them together. I adore chiffons, and shopping, and all the frivolities of life.\" Ten days later Eve was in London, a petted guest in one of the prettiest houses in Bruton Street. Lady Hartley had the knack of beautify ing any house she lived in, even a furnished house, a tent that was to be shifted in less than three months. Huge boxes of flowers were sent up from Redwold every other day to decorate those London rooms, and not content with this"], [80, "72 THE VENETIANS. floral decoration, Maud Hartley was always buying things \u2014 china, lamps, baskets, elegant frivolities of all kinds, to make the hired house homelike. She would apologize to her husband in an airy way for each fresh extravagance. \" That pretty china plaque caught my eye at Howell and James's while Eve and I were looking at their silks,\" she would say. Sir Hubert complained laughingly that if the Kohinoor were for sale at a London jeweller's it would inevitably catch Maud's eye. \" And her eye once caught she is hypnotized,\" said Sir Hubert. \" She must buy.\" Charles Street and Bruton Street are very near. Vansittart could run over, as his sister called it, at any and every hour of the day ; and the result of this vicinity was that he lived more in his sister's house than in his mother's. But Mrs. Vansittart was kind, and seemed really pleased with her future daughter-in-law ; so when Jack was not in Bruton Street Eve was in Charles Street, at luncheon sometimes, but oftener at afternoon tea, and at cosy little dinners, in the arrangement of which Mrs. Vansittart excelled. She knew a great many people in London,"], [81, "73 AS A SPIRIT FROM DREAM TO DREAM. military, clerical, legal, literary, and artistic, and she knew how to blend her society and bring people together who really liked to meet each other. This world of London in the season was a new world to Eve Marchant ; these homes in which the pinch of poverty, the burden of debt, had never been felt, had a new atmosphere. Her spirits, gay even in the midst of household care, rose in these happier circles, and she charmed all who met her by her spontaneous graces of mind and manner, her quickness to perceive, her ready appreciation of wit and sense in others. For Vansittart that month of May in the great city was a period of consummate happiness. The freshness of Eve's feelings gave a new flavour to the commonest things. The parks and gardens, the picture-galleries, the concerts and theatres were all new to her. Only on the rarest occa sions had she been gratified by an evening in London and the sight of a famous actor. Her father had always excused himself from taking his daughters to any public amusements on the plea of poverty. All the Marchant girls had known of London"], [82, "74 THE VENETIANS. began and ended in the drapers' shops and the after-season sales. To travel to town by an early train, third class, to tramp about all day in mud or dust, as the case might be, and to eat a hurried luncheon at some homely pastry-cook's, was the utmost they had known of metropolitan pleasures ; and even days so unluxurious had been holidays to them. To see the shop windows, to have the spending of a little money, ever so little, meant happiness. It was only when they had emptied their purses that the shadow of care descended upon them, and they began to doubt whether they had invested their pittance wisely. Now Eve moved about like a queen among people who never had to think about money. She was taken to see everything that was worth seeing ; to hear everything that was worth hear ing. She saw all the picture-galleries, and learnt to discriminate between all the schools of modern art. She heard Sarasate, and Hollmann, and Menter, and all the great instrumentalists of her epoch. She never heard of cabs or omnibuses, or fares, or money given for tickets. She was carried hither and thither in a luxurious barouche or a snug brougham, and her place at concert"], [83, "AS A SPIRIT FROM DREAM TO DREAM. 75 and play was always ready for her \u2014 one of the best places in the hall or the theatre. The dress makers, and bootmakers, and milliners to whom Lady Hartley took her never talked of money ; indeed they seemed almost to shudder at any allusion to that vulgar drudge 'twixt man and man. The people at the tailor's were as interested in the gowns and coats they were to make for her as if they had been works of art for which fame would be the sole recompense. The French woman who was to make her wedding-gown pooh poohed the question of cost. Expensive, this frise velvet for the train \u2014 yes, that might be, but she would rather make Mademoiselle a present of the fabric than that, with her tall and graceful figure, she should wear anything com monplace or insignificant. Art for art's sake was ostensibly the motto for all Bond Street. And Eve had so much to think of that she could not think very seriously about her trousseau. She let Lady Hartley order what she pleased. She, Eve, had her lover to think about ; and that was an absorbing theme. She knew his footstep on the pavement below the open window; she knew the sound of the bell when he rang it. If"], [84, "76 THE VENETIANS. the weather were wet, and he came from Charles Street in a hansom, she knew his way of throwing back the cab doors before the wheels stopped. When he was absent, all her life was made up of thinking about him and listening for his coming. In that morning hour in the drawing-room before he arrived she might have sat to Sir Frederick Leighton for \" Waiting \" or \" Expectancy.\" It was scarcely strange that while John Van sittart was so absorbed in the new delight of his life, John Smith was just a little neglectful of his protegees in Saltero's Mansion, Chelsea. John Smith had, indeed, no consciousness of being neglectful. If the image of Lisa flashed across his mind in any moment of his full and happy day it came and went together with the com fortable thought that he had done his duty to that young woman. She had her aunt, her bright and pretty home, her singing master, and all the delightful hopes and ambitions of an artist who has discovered that she has fortune within her reach. Had he thought of Lisa all day long, he could never have pictured her otherwise than happy and contented."], [85, "AS A SPIRIT FROM DREAM TO DREAM. 77 He was at Covent Garden one evening with his sister and his betrothed, and he saw the Venetian amidst her troops of companions. The opera was William Tell, and Lisa was in short petticoats and Swiss bodice, with gold chains about her neck and arms, and gold daggers in her hair. She looked very pretty, amidst that hetero geneous crew of young, middle-aged, and elderly. He was in the stalls, and at a considerable dis tance from the stage, and those dark eyes did not find him out and fasten upon him as they had done that other night when he was in Lady Davenant's box. The sight of her reminded him that it was nearly a month since he had called upon the aunt and niece, and that she ought to have made some progress with her musical train ing in the interval, progress enough, at any rate, to make the childish creature anxious to report herself to him. Eve was to be engaged at her dressmaker's on the following afternoon, in a solemn ordeal described as \" trying on ; \" and Vansittart had been warned by his sister that he must not expect to be favoured with her society until the evening, when they were all to dine in Charles Street. It"], [86, "78 THE VENETIANS. seemed to him that he could hardly employ this afternoon better than in visiting Fiordelisa and her aunt, who would be wounded perhaps in their warm southern hearts if he should seem to have lost all interest in their welfare. The day was delightful \u2014 one of those brilliant afternoons in May which give to West End Lon don the air of an earthly paradise ; a paradise of smart shops and smart people, thorough-bred horses and newly built carriages, liveries spick and span from the tailor's ; flowers everywhere \u2014 in the carriages, in the shops, on the kerbstone \u2014 flowers and fine clothes and spring sunshine. Vansittart walked to Chelsea, glad of an excuse for a walk after the habitual carriage or hansom. He had promised to look at some pictures in Tite Street upon this very afternoon \u2014 pictures of that advanced Belgian school whose work he would scarcely care to show to Miss Marchant without a previous inspection \u2014 so he availed himself of the opportunity, and called at the painter's house on his way to Saltero's Mansion. He found a room full of people, looking at pictures set round on easels draped with terra cotta silk, criticizing freely and talking pro-"], [87, "AS A SPIRIT FROM DREAM TO DREAM. 79 digiously. He found himself in the midst of an artistic tea-party. There was a copper kettle singing over a spirit-lamp on a table crowded with Spanish irises, and there was the painter's young English wife, in an orange-coloured Liberty gown, pouring out tea, and smiling at the praises of her husband. The painter was no phlegmatic Fleming, but a dark-eyed, fiery son of French Flanders. He came from the red country between Namur and Liege, and had been reared and educated in the latter city. He was standing by the largest of his pictures \u2014 a scene from \" Manon Lescaut \" \u2014 and listening to the criticisms of a little knot of people, all apparently ecstatic, and among these elite of the art-loving world Vansittart was surprised to see Mr. Sefton. Sefton turned at the sound of Vansittart's voice. They had met a good many times since Easter, and in a good many houses, for it was one of Sefton's attributes to be seen everywhere ; but Vansittart had not expected to find him at a com paratively unknown painter's tea-party. \" Delightful picture, ain't it ? \" he asked care-"], [88, "80 THE VENETIANS. lessly. \"Full of truth and feeling. How is Miss Marchant to-day ? I thought she looked a little pale and fagged at Lady Heavyside's last night, as if her first season were taking it out of her.\" \" I don't think my sister would let her do too much.\" They had drifted towards the tea-table, and the crowd had stranded them in a corner, where they could talk at their ease. \"I did not know you were by way of being an art critic.\" \"I am by way of being everything. I give myself up to sport \u2014 body and bones \u2014 all the winter. I let my poor little scraps of intellect and taste hibernate from the first of September till I have been at the killing of a May fox ; and then I turn my back upon rusticity, put on my frock-coat and cylinder hat, and see as much as I can of the world of art and letters. To that end I have chosen this street for my summer habitation.\" \" You live here\u2014 in Tite Street ? \" \" Is that so surprising ? Tite Street is not a despicable locality. We consider ourselves rather smart.\""], [89, "81 AS A SPIRIT FROM DREAM TO DREAM. \" I should have looked for you nearer the clubs.\" \" I am by no means devoted to the clubs. I like my own nest and my own newspapers. Is not this little bit full of colour and feeling ? \" He turned to admire a cabinet picture on a draped easel \u2014 \"Esmeralda and the Captain of the Guard,\" one of those pictures which Vansit tart would have preferred Eve Marchant not to see, but over which \u00e6sthetic maids and matrons were expatiating rapturously. Vansittart did not stop to take tea, meaning to gratify Lisa by allowing her to entertain him with the mild infusion she called by that name. He spoke to the two or three people he knew, praised the pictures in very good French to the artist, who knew no English, and slipped out of the sultry room, with its odour of violets and tea-cake, into the fresh air blowing up the river from the woods and pastures of Bucks and Berks. He had not walked above half a dozen yards upon the Embankment when he heard the sound of hurrying footsteps behind him, and an un gloved hand was thrust through his arm, and a VOL. II.

I thought you had forgotten us altogether.\" \"That was very wrong of you, Signora,\" he answered, gently disengaging himself from the olive-complexioned hand, plump and tapering, albeit somewhat broad, such a hand as Titian painted by the score, perhaps, before he began to paint Cardinal Princes and great ladies. He did not want to walk along the Chelsea Embankment, in the broad glare of day, with the Venetian hanging affectionately upon him. That kind of thing might pass on the Lido, or in the Royal Garden by the canal, but here the local colour was wanting. \" It is ages since you have been near us,\" pro tested Fiordelisa, poutingly. \" I am sure you must have forgotten us.\" \"Not I, Signora. Englishmen don't forget their friends so easily. I have been in the country till \u2014 till quite lately. And you \u2014 tell me how you have been getting on with your singing master.\" \" He shall tell you,\" cried Fiordelisa, flashing one of her brightest looks upon him. \" He"], [91, "AS A SPIRIT FROM DREAM TO DREAM. 83 pretends to be monstrously pleased with me. He declares that in a few months, perhaps even sooner, he will get me an engagement at one of the small theatres, to sing in a comic opera. They will give me ever so much more money than I am earning at Coveny Gardeny.\" The Venetian often put a superfluous vowel at the end of a word, not yet having mastered those sternly English terminations of hard consonants. \" The maestro is to have some of the money for his trouble, but that is fair, is it not ? \" \" Fair that he should take a small percentage, perhaps, but not more.\" \" A percentage ? What is that ? \" Vansittart explained. \"But to sing in your English comic opera I must speak English ever so much better than I do now,\" pursued Lisa, \" and for that I am working, oh, so hard. I learn grammar. I read story books ; 'Bootle's Baby;' the ' Vicar of Wake field.' Oh, how I have laughed and cried over that Vicar and his troubles \u2014 and Olivia \u2014 Olivia who was so ill-used \u2014 and so happy at last.\" \"Happy, with a scoundrel,\" exclaimed Van sittart."], [92, "84 THE VENETIANS. \" Ah, but she loved him. One does not mind how much scoundrel if one loves a man.\" \" A bad principle, Signorina. It is better to love a good man ever so little than a scoundrel ever so much.\" \"No, no, no. It is the loving much that means happiness,\" argued Lisa, and then she expatiated upon her English studies. \" La Zia and I go to the theatre when there is no per formance at Coveny Gardeny. \"We sit in the pit, where the people are kind, and make room for us because we are foreigners. Signor Zinco says there is no better way of learning English than in listening to the actors in good plays. Oh, how I listen ! In three months from this day people will take me for an Englishwoman,\" she said finally. \" Never, Lisa, never,\" he said, laughingly con templative of the sparkling olive face, the great dark eyes with golden lights in them, the care less arrangement of the coarse black hair, the supple figure in its plain black gown, and the essentially foreign and southern air which years of residence in England would hardly obliterate. \" Never, Si'ora !

He was thinking that possibly Eve's \"trying on \" would be finished in time for him to snatch half an hour's tete-a-tete in one of the Bruton Street drawing-rooms, before she dressed for dinner. There were three drawing-rooms, in a diminishing perspective, dwindling almost to a point, the third and inner room too small to serve any purpose but flirtation, and here the lovers could usually find seclusion. Lisa pouted and looked unhappy. \" You might stay and take tea with me,\" she said ; \" la Zia will be home soon.\" \" La Zia is out, then ? \" \" Yes ; she has taken Paolo to Battersea Park for the afternoon. The rehearsal for the new opera keeps me all day long, and la Zia takes the boy for his daily walk ; but it is past five, and they will be home as soon as I am, I dare say.\" \" I will come this way again in a week or so, Si'ora.\" \" You are very unkind,\" protested Lisa, in her impulsive way ; and then, with one of those sudden changes which so well became her childish uncultured beauty, she exclaimed, \" No, no :"], [95, "AS A SPIRIT FROM DREAM TO DREAM. 87 forgive me ; you are always kind \u2014 kind, kindest of men.

She was too pretty and too peculiar looking not to attract notice ; and there was the tea-party in Tite Street, with its little crowd of worldlings, any of whom would be curious as to his companion, should he by chance be seen in this society. He did not want to be rude, for the lace-girl from Burano was a creature of strong feelings, and was easily wounded. \" I am in a desperate hurry, Si'ora.' \"You were not in a hurry when I overtook you just now. You were walking slowly. You cannot walk faster than I. At Burano I never used to walk. I always ran.\" \" Poverina ! How quickly you must have used up your island.\" \" Yes ; it was like a prison. I used to watch"], [96, "88 THE VENETIANS. the painted sails of the fishing-boats, and long for them to carry me away to any place different from that island, where I knew every face and every stone, every window and every chimney. That is why I love your London, in spite of fogs and grey skies. It is so big, so big.\" She stopped, with clasped hands and flashing eyes. A street boy wheeled round to look at her, and gave a low whistle of admiring surprise ; and at the same instant Sefton turned a street corner, came across the road, and passed close to Van sittart and his companion. Of all men living, this man was the last whom Vansittart would have cared to meet under such conditions."], [97, "89 CHAPTER V. \" LOVE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE LOVE.\" Sefton lifted his hat and passed quickly. Van sittart stood mutely watching his retreating figure, till it was lost among other figures moving to and fro along the Embankment. An empty hansom came creeping slowly by the curb while he stood watching. \" Here is a cab which will just do for me, Signorina,\" he said. \" Good-bye. I'll see j7ou on one of your maestro's days, so that I may hear his opinion of your chances.\" \" He comes on Tuesdays and Saturdays, from three to four. Who is that gentleman who bowed to you ? A friend ? \" \" No ; only an acquaintance. Good-bye.\" \" How vexed you look ! Are you ashamed of being seen with me ? \""], [98, "90 THE VENETIANS. \" No, child, no ; only that man happens to be one of my particular aversions. A rivederci. Stay ! I will take you to your door. The cab can follow.\" It had occurred to him in a moment that Sefton was capable of turning and pursuing Lisa if he left her unprotected. He was just the kind of man, Vansittart thought, who, out of sheer devilry, would try to discover the name and antecedents of this lovely stranger. He had a deep-rooted distrust of Wilfred Sefton, which led him to anticipate evil. He walked with Lisa to Saltero's Mansion, and saw her vanish under the lofty doorway, with its Queen Anne portico, and then he turned and walked slowly back as far as Tite Street, with the cab following him. So far there was no sign of Sefton, who might, therefore, be supposed to have continued his way Londonwards; but the rencontre had been a shock to Vansittart's nerves, and had set him thinking seriously upon the danger of his relations with Fiordelisa and her aunt, and more especially of the peril which must always attach to the use of an alias. Was it well, or wise, or safe that he, Eve Mar-"], [99, "91 \"LOVE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE LOVE.\" chant's promised husband, should be the guardian angel of this wild, impulsive peasant girl \u2014 a guardian angel under the borrowed name of Smith, liable at any hour to be confronted with people who knew his real name and surroundings ? He considered his position very seriously during the drive to Bruton Street, and he resolved to do all in his power to narrow his relations with the Venetians, while fulfilling every promise and every obligation to the uttermost. Colonel Marchant was at the family dinner in Charles Street. It had been agreed between Mrs. Vansittart and her son that he should be invited to this one gathering, so that he should not have any ground for considering himself left out in the cold, albeit his future son-in-law's intention was to hold as little communion with him as possible. Eve's neglected girlhood had not fostered filial affection. The father's name had been a name of fear in the Marchant household, and the sisters had been happiest when their only parent was amusing himself in London, careless of whether the angry baker had stopped the daily supply, or the long-suffering butcher had refused to deliver"], [100, "92 THE VENETIANS. another joint. Such a man had but little claim upon a daughter's love, and Eve had confessed to Vansittart that her father was not beloved by his children, and that it would not grieve her if in her future life she and that father met but rarely. \" You are going to be so generous to me,\" she said, \" that I shall be able to help my sisters \u2014 in ever so many ways \u2014 with their clothes, and with their housekeeping ; for I can never spend a third part of the income you are settling upon me. \" My frugal Eve ! Why, there are women with half your charms who would not be able to dress themselves upon such a pittance.\" \" I have no patience with such women. They should be condemned to three gowns a year of their own making, as my sisters and I have been ever since we were old enough to handle needles and scissors. I am horrified at the extravagance I have seen at the dressmaker's \u2014 the reckless way some of your sister's friends spend money.\" \" And my sister herself, no doubt. She has a rich husband, and I dare say is one of the worst offenders in this line ? \""], [101, "\"LOVE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE LOVE.\" 93 \" Not she ! Lady Hartley dresses exquisitely, but she is not extravagant like the others. She is too generous to other people to be lavish upon herself. She is always thinking of doing a kind ness to somebody.\" \" Poor little Maud ! I remember when she was in the school-room all her pocket-money used to be spent upon dolls for the hospital children. She used to come and beg of me when she was insolvent.\" Vansittart met Wilfred Sefton at an evening party within a few days of that rencontre at Chelsea; and at the same party Vansittart was disturbed by seeing Sefton and his mother in close confabulation in one of those remote and luxurious corners where people are not obliged to listen to the music that is being performed in the principal room. He questioned his mother about Sefton at breakfast next morning. \"You and he seemed uncommonly thick,\" he said. \" What were you talking about ? \" \" About you, and your approaching marriage.\" \"I am sure you said nothing that was not"], [102, "94 THE VENETIANS. kind, but I wish to Heaven you would not discuss my affairs with a stranger,\" said Vansittart, with some warmth. \"Mr. Sefton is not a stranger. Your father and his father were very good friends. He is j7our sister's most influential neighbour, and they are on the friendliest terms. Why should you call him a stranger ? \" \" Because I don't like him, mother ; and because I wish never to feel myself on any other footing with him.\" \" And yet he likes you.\" \" Does he ? I am a very bad judge of humanity if my dislike of Sefton is not heartily reciprocated by Sefton's dislike of me. And no doubt the more he dislikes me the more he will assure other people \u2014 my kindred especially \u2014 that he likes me. You are too straight yourself, mother, in every thought and purpose, to understand the Seftonian mind. It is the kind of intellect which always works crookedly, which cannot go straight. He admired Eve Marchant, allowed his admiration to be patent to everybody, and yet was not man enough to try to win her for his wife.\""], [103, "\"LOVE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE LOVE.\" 95 \"He had not your courage, Jack, in facing unpleasant surroundings and disagreeable ante cedents.\" \" He had not manhood enough to marry for love. That is what you mean, mother. He was quite willing to compromise an innocent and pure-minded girl, by attentions which he would not have dared to offer to a girl with a watchful father or mother.\" \" My dear Jack, you exaggerate Mr. Sefton's attentions. He assured me that his chief interest in Eve arose from his old companionship with her brother, with whom he was on very intimate terms until the unhappy young man turned out an irretrievable scamp.\" Vansittart winced at the phrase. It is not an agreeable thing for a man to be told that his future brother-in-law, the brother whom his future wife adores, is irretrievable. \" Mr. Sefton has taken a great deal of trouble to trace Harold Marchant's career since he was last heard of,\" continued Mrs. Vansittart, \"and would hold out a friendly hand to him if there were anything to be done.\" \" He has no need to hold out a friendly hand."], [104, "96 THE VENETIANS. If there is anything to be done for my brother in-law I can do it.\" \" How ready you are to take new burdens.\" \" I think nothing a burden which comes to me with the woman I love.\" Mrs. Vansittart sighed, and was silent. The idea of these disreputable connections which her son was to take to himself in marrying Eve was full of pain for the country-bred lady, whose people on every side were of good birth and unblemished respectability. Never had there been any doubtful characters in her father's family, or among that branch of the Vansittarts to which her husband belonged. She had been born in just that upper middle class which feels disgrace most keenly. There is no section of society so self-conscious as your county gentry, so fixed in the idea that the eyes of Europe are upon them. The duke or the millionaire can live down anything \u2014 sons convicted of felony, daughters divorced \u2014 but the country gentleman who has lived all his life in one place, and knows every face within a radius of twenty miles from the family seat, to him, or still more to his wife or widow, the slightest smirch upon a relative's character means agony."], [105, "97 \"LOVE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE LOVE.\" Mrs. Vansittart liked and admired Eve Marchant ; but she did not let her heart go out to her as it ought to have gone to the girl who was so soon to be to her as a daughter. Colonel Marchant 's existence was a rock of offence which even maternal love could not surmount. She had talked to her family lawyer, an old and trusted friend, and from him she had heard all that was to be said for and against Eve's father. He was not quite so black, perhaps, as his neighbours in the country had painted him ; but his career had been altogether disreputable, and his present associations were among the most disreputable men, calling themselves gentlemen, about town. He was a familiar figure in the card-room at clubs where play was high, and was looked upon with unmitigated terror by the parents and guardians of young men of fortune or expectations. A youth who affected Colonel Marchant's society was known to be in a bad way. And now the question was not only of Colonel Marchant, but of his son, who was even a darker character than the father, and whose darkness might at any time communicate itself to his sister's name. It was easy enough to say VOL. II. h"], [106, "98 THE VENETIANS. that the sister was blameless, that it was no fault of hers that her father was a scamp, and her brother a swindler and a forger. Society does not easily forgive sisters or daughters for such relationships, and now that the pseudo-scientific <;raze of heredity has taken hold of the English mind, society is less inclined even than of yore to ignore the black sheep in the fold. Every one who heard of Eve Marchant's antecedents would anticipate evil for her husband. The bad strain would show itself somehow before many years were gone. The duskiness in the parental wool would crop up in the fleece of the lamb. It was hard, very hard, for the mother who doated on her only son, to feel ashamed of his wife's relations and up-bringing ; and Mrs. Van sittart feared that to the end of her life she must needs feel this shame. Already her neighbours at Merewood had tortured her by their keen interest in her son's betrothed, their eagerness to know every detail, their searching questions about her people, all veiled under that affec tionate friendliness which justifies the most tormenting curiosity. Mrs. Vansittart was a good woman and a"], [107, "\"LOVE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE LOVE.\" 99 devoted mother, but she had the temperament which easily yields to worrying ideas, to dark apprehensions of possible evils, and her love of her son had just that alloy of jealousy which is apt to cause trouble. While John Vansittart was going about with his betrothed from one scene of amusement to another, utterly happy in her company7, enchanted to show her places and people which were as new to her as if they had been in fairyland, his mother was brooding over her fears and fostering her forebodings, and affording Mr. Sefton every opportunity of im proving his acquaintance with her. It was a shock to Vansittart to find that Sefton had estab lished himself on the most familiar footing in Charles Street, a privileged afternoon dropper-in, who might call six days out oft he seven if he chose, since Mrs. Vansittart had no allotted day for receiving, but was always at home to her friends between four and five during the summer season, when the pleasantest hour for driving was after five. Sefton was clever, lived entirely in society and for society, during the brief London season, frequented the studios of artists and the tea"], [108, "100 THE VENETIANS. parties of litterateurs, knew, or pretended to know, everything that was going to happen in the world of art and letters, and would have been welcome on his own merits in the circles of the frivolous. He contrived to amuse Mrs. Van sittart, and to impress her with an exaggerated idea of his talent and versatility. \"He can talk well upon every subject,\" she told her son. \"My dear mother, you mean that he is an adept in the season's jargon, and can talk of those subjects which came into fashion last month ; like the new cut of our coat collars, and the new colour of our neckties. A man of that kind always impresses people with his cleverness in May and the first half of June. Talk with him later, and you'll find him flat, stale, and unpro fitable. By July he will have emptied his bag.\" It was scarcely a surprise to Vansittart, know ing his mother's liking for Mr. Sefton, to find that gentleman seated in her drawing-room one Saturday evening when he returned rather late from a polo match at Hurlingham. It was to be Eve's last Saturday in London. June was at"], [109, "\"LOVE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE LOVE.\" 101 hand, and she was to go back to Fernhurst on the first of the month, to spend the small remnant of her single life with her sisters. She was to be married on St. John's Day. They had lingered at the tea-table on the lawn, sighing sentimentally over the idea that this was positively the last Saturday ; that not again for nearly a year could they sit together drinking tea out of the homely little brown tea pot, and watching the careless crowd come and go in the sunshine and the summery air. In Charles Street, the cups and saucers had not been cleared away, although it was past seven. A side window in the front drawing room looked westward, up the old-fashioned street, towards the Park, and tthe low sunlight was pouring in through the Madras-muslin curtain, shining on the jardiniere of golden lilies and over the glittering toys on the silver table. Vansittart opened the drawing-room door, but changed his mind about going in when he saw Sefton established on the sofa, half hidden in a sea of pillows. \" I'm very late,\" he said. \" How do you do, Sefton?\" with a curt nod. \"I'm to dine in"], [110, "102 THE VENETIANS. Bruton Street, mother. Good night, if I don't see you again. \" Pray come in, Jack. I have something very serious to tell you \u2014 or at least Mr. Sefton has.

It is too serious for delay.\" \" If I hadn't left Miss Marchant and my sister five minutes ago I should think, by your solemnity, that one of them had been killed,\" exclaimed Vansittart, scornfully, crossing the room with leisurely step, and seating himself with his back to the yellow brightness of that western window. \" And now, my dear mother, may I inquire the nature of the mountain which you and Mr. Sefton have conjured out of some innocent mole-hill ? Please don't be very slow and solemn, as I have only half an hour to dress and get to Bruton Street. Boi'to's Mephistopheles will begin at half-past eight.\" \"This is no trivial matter, Jack. Perhaps when you have heard what Mr. Sefton has to tell you may hardly care about the opera \u2014 or about seeing Miss Marchant, before you have had time for serious thought.\""], [111, "103 \"LOVE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE LOVE.\" \" There is nothing that Mr. Sefton \u2014 or the four Evangelists \u2014 could tell me that would alter my feelings about Miss Marchant by one jot or one tittle,\" cried Vansittart, furiously, his angry feel ing about this man leaping out of him like a sudden flame. \" Wait,\" said the mother, gravely \u2014 \" wait till you have heard.\" \"Begin, Mr. Sefton. My mother's preamble is eminently calculated to give importance to your communication.\" \" I am hardly surprised that you should take the matter somewhat angrily, Vansittart,\" said Sefton, in his smooth, persuasive voice. \" I dare say I shall appear an officious beast in this business \u2014 and, had it not been for Mrs. Van sittart's express desire, I should not be here to tell you the facts which have come to my know ledge within the last two days. I considered it my duty to tell your mother, because in our pre vious conversations she has been good enough to allude to old ties of friendship between your father and my father \u2014 and this made a claim upon me.\" \"Proem the second,\" cried Vansittart, im patiently. \" When are we coming to facts ? \""], [112, "104 THE VENETIANS. \"The facts are so uncommonly disagreeable that I may be pardoned for approaching them diffidently. You know, I believe, that Miss Marchant has a brother \" \" Who disappeared some years ago, and about whose fate you have busied yourself,\" interrupted Vansittart, with ever-growing impatience. \"All my efforts to trace Harold Marchant's movements after his departure from Mashonaland resulted in utter failure, until the day before yesterday, when one of the two men whom I employed to make inquiries turned up at my house in Tite Street as suddenly as if he had dropped from the moon. This man is a courier and jack-of-all-trades, as clever and handy a dog as ever lived, a man who has travelled in all the quarters of the globe, a Venetian. When I began the search for Miss Marchant's brother, I put the business in the first place into the hands of a highly respectable private detective ; but as a second string to my bow it occurred to me to send a full statement of the circumstances, and a careful description of the missing man, to my old acquaintance, Ferrari, the courier, guide, philosopher, and friend, who travelled with my"], [113, "105 \" LOVE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE LOVE.\" poor father on the sea-board of Italy for several months, and who helped to nurse .him on his sick-bed.\" Vansittart bridled his tongue, but could not keep himself from drumming with his fingers on the dainty silver table and setting all the toy harpsichords, and sofas, and bird-cages, and watering-pots, and bonbonnieres rattling. \" I had half forgotten that I had employed this man in Harold Marchant's business when the fellow turned up in Tite Street, bronzed and bearded, irrepressibly cheerful, with the most unpleasant information.\" \" What information ? For God's sake, come to the point ! \" \"He had traced Marchant's career \u2014 from Mashonaland to the diamond fields, where he picked up a goodish bit of money ; from the diamond fields to New York, from New York to Venice. For God's sake, leave those bibelots alone,\" as the silver toys leapt and rattled on the fragile table. \" Do you think no one has nerves except yourself ? \" \"Your man traced Marchant to Venice,\" said Vansittart, the restless hand suddenly motion less ; \" and what of him at Venice ? \""], [114, "106 THE VENETLANS. \" At Venice Marchant lived with a girl whom he had taken out of a factory. Pardon me, Mrs. Vansittart, for repeating these unpleasant facts \u2014 lived, gambled, drank, and enjoyed life after his own inclination, which always leaned to low company even when he was an undergraduate. From Venice he vanished suddenly, more than three years ago.\" Vansittart fancied they must needs hear that heavily beating heart of his thumping against his ribs. He fancied that, even in that dimly lighted room, they must needs see the ashen hue of his face, the beads of sweat upon his forehead. All he could do was to hold his tongue, and wait for that which was to come. \" Do you happen to remember a murder, or, I will rather say, a scuffle ending in homicide, which occurred at Venice three years ago in Carnival time \u2014 an English tourist stabbed to death by another Englishman, who got away so quickly and so cleverly that he was never brought to book for what he had done ?

At Venice Harold Marchant called him self Smith ; and Smith was the name he gave on board the P. and O. steamer which took him to Alexandria.\" \" Why did he go to Alexandria ? \" \" Why ? To get away from Venice in the quickest and completest manner he could. When"], [116, "108 THE VENETIANS. he saw that the knife had been fatal, he grasped the situation in an instant, made a dash for the door, ran through the crowd along the Piazzetta, jumped into the water, and swam to the steamer, which was getting up steam for departure. No one guessed that he would make for the steamer. It was a longish swim ; and while his pursuers were groping about among the gondolas the steamer was moving off with Harold on board her.

The nearest, dearest kin of this girl on whose milk-white shoulder his breath came and went, as he sat with bent head in the shadow of the velvet curtain, and heard the weird strange harmonies of Pandemonium, almost as if voices and orchestra had been interpreting his own dark thoughts. Charmed as she was with the music, Eve Marchant was far too sensitive to be unconscious of her lover's altered spirits. Once during the applause that followed that lovely duet at the beginning of the last act, and while Lady Hartley's attention was fixed upon the stage, Eve's hand crept stealthily into the hand of her"], [125, "\"LOVE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTE LOVE.\" 117 lover, while she whispered, \" What has happened, Jack ? I know there is something wrong. Why won't you trust me ? \" Trust her ? Trust her with a secret that must part them for ever, let her suffer the agony of knowing that this strong right hand which her slim fingers were caressing had stabbed her brother to the heart ? \" There can be nothing wrong, dearest, while I have you,\" he answered, grasping the little hand, as if he would never let it go. \" But outside me, you have been worried about something. You have quite changed from your gay spirits at Hurlingham.\" \" My love, I exhausted myself at Hurlingham. You and I were laughing like children. That can't last. But for me there is no outside world. Be sure of that. My world begins and ends where you are.\" \" My own dear love,\" she whispered softly, And so hand in hand they listened to the last act, while Lady Hartley amused herself now with the stage, and now with the audience, and left these plighted lovers alone in their fool's paradise."], [126, "118 THE VENETIANS. Sunday was given up to church and church parade, looking at people and gowns and bonnets in Hyde Park. Vansittart had to be observant and ready, amusing and 'amused, as he walked beside his sister and his betrothed. He had to say smart things about the people and the bonnets, to explain and give brief biographies of all the men whom he saluted, or with whom he spoke. He had to do this, and to be gay and light-hearted in the drive to Richmond, and at the late luncheon in the pretty upstairs room at the Star and Garter, where the balcony hung high over the smiling valley, over the river that meanders in gracious curves through wooded meadows and past the rustic townlet of \" Twicks.\" Happiness is the dominant in the scale of pros perous love. Why or how should he fail to be happy, adored by this sweet girl, who in less than six weeks was to be his very own, to have and to hold till death ?

She was going to an evening service with Lady Hartley. They were to hear a famous preacher, while the mundane Sir Hubert dined at Greenwich with some men. Eve was to leave Waterloo Station early next morning, and as Lady Hartley was sending her maid to see the young lady and her luggage safely lodged at the Homestead, Vansittart was told he would not be wanted. \" This is a free country,\" he said. \" You will find me at the station to say good-bye.\" He went home to dine with his mother, a very melancholy dinner.

Vansittart followed her to the drawing-room directly after dinner, and seated himself by her side in the lamplight, and laid his hand on hers as it turned the pages of the book upon her knee. \" Canon Liddon is a delightful writer, mother ; logical, clear-headed, and eloquent, and you could hardly have a better book than his Bampton Lectures for Sunday evening ; but you might spare a few minutes for your son.\" \" As many minutes or as many hours as you like, Jack,\" answered his mother, as she closed the book. \" My thoughts are too full of you to follow any writer who wants close attention. My dear son, what can I say to you ? Do you really mean to persist in this miserable alliance ? \" \"Oh, mother, how cruel you are even in your kindness ! How cruel a mother's love can be !

The utmost that can be urged against this wicked young man is that he was a hot-tempered athlete who killed a man in a scuffle. Let us forget his existence, if we can. There is nothing in this life more unlikely than that we shall ever hear of him again. From that night in the Venetian caffe he ceased to exist \u2014 at any7 rate for England and his kindred. Be sure, mother, that Harold Marchant will never be heard of again.\" \" You believe what you wish to believe, Jack, and you forget the French proverb that nothing is so likely to happen as the unexpected.\" \" No, I don't, mother.

TO LIVE FORGOTTEN AND LOVE FORLORN. Vansittart had made up his mind. Were that which he accounted at present but a dark sus- picion made absolute certainty he meant still to cleave to the girl whom he had chosen for his wife, and who had given him her whole heart. He would marry her, even although his hand had shed her brother's blood, that brother whom of all her kindred she loved best, with the most ardent and romantic love, with the fond affection which clings round the image of a friend lost in childhood, when the feelings are warmest, and when love asks no questions. Once, in the little end room in Bruton Street, between two stolen kisses, he said to her, \" You pretend to be very fond of me, Eve. I wonder whom you love next best ? \""], [132, "124 THE VENETIANS. \" Harold,\" she answered quickly. \" I used to think I should never give any one his place in my heart. But you have stolen the first place. He is only second now, poor dear \u2014 dead or living, only second.\" The tears welled up in her eyes as she spoke of him. A brother is not often loved so fondly ; hardly ever, unless he is a scamp. And would she marry him, Jack Vansittart, if she knew that he had killed her brother ? Alas, no ! That dark story would make an impassable gulf between them. Loving him with all her heart, dependent upon him for all the happiness and prosperity of her future life, she would sacrifice herself and him to the manes of that worthless youth, slain by the man his brutality had provoked to responsive violence. \" There was not much to choose between us,\" Vansittart told himself; \"ruffians both. And are two lives to be blighted because of those few moments of fury, in which the brute got the upper hand of the man ? No, a thousand times no. I will marry her, and let Fate do the worst to us both. Fate can but part us. Why should I anticipate evil by taking the initiative ? A"], [133, "TO LIVE FORGOTTEN AND LOVE FORLORN. 125 man who has happiness in his hand and lets it go, for any compunctions of consciecne, may be a fine moral character, but he is not the less a fool. Life is not long enough for scruples that part faithful lovers.\" He looked the situation full in the face. He told himself that it was for Eve's welfare as well as for his own that he should keep from her the knowledge of his wrong-doing. Would she be happier, would mankind be any the better off for his self-abnegation, if he should tell her the truth, and accept his dismissal? Knowing what he knew she could scarcely lay her hand in his and take him for her husband ; but once the vow spoken, once his wife, he thought that she might even forgive him her brother's blood. She must never know ! He had blustered and raged in that troubled scene with Sefton ; but sober reflection taught him that if he were to be safe in the future he must conciliate the man he hated. A word from Sefton could spoil his happiness ; and he could not afford to be ill friends with the man who had power to speak that word ; nor could he afford to arouse that man's suspicions by any eccentricity of conduct"], [134, "126 THE VENETIANS. on his own part. He had refused to hear the story of Harold Marchant's life from the courier's lips, as Sefton suggested, had refused with scorn- ful vehemence. But reflection told him that he ought to examine the courier's chain of evidence, and to discover for himself if the links were strong enough to make Harold Marchant's identity with Fiordelisa's lover an absolute certainty. He wanted to know the worst, not to be fooled and made miserable by the illogical imaginings of an amateur detective. Again, it was natural that a man in his position should look closely into this story, testing its accuracy by the severest scrutiny ; and he wanted to act naturally, to act as Sefton would expect him to act. Influenced by these considerations, he called in Tite Street on Monday afternoon, and found Setton at home, in a room which occupied the entire first floor of a smallish house, but which could be made into two rooms by drawing a curtain. It was the most luxurious room that Vansittart had seen for a long time, but there was a studied sobriety in its luxury which marked the man of sense as well as the Sybarite. The colouring was subdued \u2014 dull olive-green \u2014 without relief save"], [135, "127 TO LIVE FORGOTTEN AND LOVE FORLORN. from a few pieces of old Italian black and white inlaid furniture, a writing-table, a coffer, a book case. Every inch of the floor was carpeted with dark-brown velvet pile. No slippery parquetry or sham oak here, no gaudy variety of Oriental prayer-rugs or furry trophies of the chase. Capacious armchairs tempted to idleness ; a choice selection of the newest and oldest books invited to study ; two large windows looking east and west flooded the room with light ; and a fireplace wide enough for a baronial hall promised heat and cheerfulness when frosts and fogs combine to make London odious. \" You like my den,\" said Sefton, when Van sittart murmured his surprise at finding so good a room in so small a house. \" Comfortable, ain't it ? The house is small, but I've reduced the number of rooms to three. Below I have only a dining-room ; above, only my bedroom. There is a rabbit-hutch at the back of the landing for my valet, and a garret in the roof for the women. Living in a colony of artists, I have taken pains to keep clear of everything artistic. I have neither stained glass nor tapestry, neither Raffaelle ware nor bronze idols; but I can offer"], [136, "128 THE VENETIANS. my friends a comfortable chair and a decently cooked dinner. I hope you'll put my professions to the test some evening, when I can get one or two of my clever neighbours to meet you.\" Vansittart professed himself ready to dine with Mr. Sefton on any occasion, and straightway proceeded to the business of his visit. \" You were good enough to suggest that I should see the courier, Ferrari,\" he said, \"and I was impolite enough to refuse \u2014 rather roughly, I fear.\" \" You were certainly a little rough,\" answered Sefton, with his suave smile, \"but I could make allowances for a man in your position. I honour the warmth of your feelings; and I admire the chivalry which makes you indifferent to the belongings of the woman you love.\" \" That which you are pleased to call chivalry, I take to be the natural conduct of any man in such circumstances. Honestly, now, Mr. Sefton, would you give up the girl you love if you found her brother had been the \u2014 the chief actor in such a scene as that row in the Venetian caffe ? Would you spoil her life and your own for such a reason ? \""], [137, "129 TO LIVE FORGOTTEN AND LOVE FORLORN. \" Well, I suppose not ; if I were tremendously in love. But the sweets of life would be con siderably soured, to my mind, by the apprehen sion of such a brother-in-law's reappearance, or by any unlooked-for concatenation which might bring his personality into the foreground.\" \" I am willing to risk such a concatenation. In the mean time it has occurred to me that I ought to see Ferrari, and look into his story dis passionately. If you will kindly give me his address I will write and ask him to call upon me.\" \" You will find him a very good fellow \u2014 a splendid animal, with a fair intelligence,\" said Sefton, writing an address. \" And now I hope you have forgiven me for bringing an unpleasant train of circumstances under your notice. You must remember that the facts in question came to my knowledge solely from my wish to oblige Miss Marchant. It would not have been fair to you to leave you in ignorance of what so nearly concerned your future wife.\" \" Certainly not ; but it would have been kinder, or wiser, on your part to have kept this know ledge from my mother.\" \" Mrs. Vansittart had won my warmest regard VOL. II. K"], [138, "130 THE VENETIANS. by her kindness to the son of an old friend. I felt my first duty was to her.\" \" That was unwise ; and your unwisdom has caused much pain. However, I thank you for having spared Miss Marchant the knowledge that would make her miserable. I may rely upon you to keep the secret always \u2014 may I not ? \" asked Vansittart, earnestly. \" Always. You have my promise.\" \" Thank you. That sets my mind at rest. I know how to deal with my mother's prejudices ; and I know that her affection for Eve will over come those prejudices \u2014 in good time.\" Ferrari called at Charles Street at eleven o'clock next morning, in accordance with Van sittart's request. As the clock struck the hour a tall, good-looking man, with reddish-brown hair, reddish-brown eyes, and a cheerful, self-satisfied smile, was ushered into Vansittart's study. \" You are punctual, Signor Ferrari. Sit down, please, and come to business at once. Mr. Sefton tells me that you are the most precise and business-like of men, as well as the best of fellows.\""], [139, "TO LIVE FORGOTTEN AND LOVE FORLORN. 131 \" Mr. Sefton have know me many years, sir. I have had the honour to nurse the of him father in his last illness.

The son does not forget what Ferrari did for the father.\" Those who knew Ferrari intimately discovered that this rescuing of would-be suicides from the Grand Canal was an idiosyncrasy of his. He affected to have saved half the distinguished travellers of Europe in this manner. \"Now, Signor Ferrari, you have no doubt considered that the charge you have brought against Mr. Harold Marchant is a very serious one \" \" Scusatemi, illustrissimo gentleman, I bring no charge,\" protested Ferrari, in his curious English, which he spoke with an American accent, having improved his knowledge of the language in the society of American travellers, few of whom condescended to Italian or even French. \" I bring no charge.

When he was at the Hotel di Roma he was known as Marchant. His signature was in the visitors' book at the hotel. Ferrari had seen it, and had recorded the date, which was in the September preceding that February in which Vansittart had shared in the gaieties of the Carnival at Venice. A fortnight later Mr."], [141, "TO LIVE FORGOTTEN AND LOVE FORLORN. 133 Marchant took a second floor in the Cam po Goldoni, under the name of Smith. There was no doubt in the courier's mind as to the identity of the man in the Campo Goldoni with the man at the Hotel di Roma. He had talked with a New Yorker who had known Marchant under both names, and who knew of his relations with the pretty lace-maker. But there was nothing in Ferrari's statement which could be called proof positive of this identity. The facts rested on information obtained at second hand. It was open to Vansittart to doubt \u2014 since error was not impossible \u2014 error as complete as that mistake which had put the man who was killed in the place of the man who killed him. Ferrari tracked the fugitive on his voyage to Alexandria : recorded the name of Smith given to the captain of the P. and O. After Alexandria there was nothing. \" Do you think he came back to Europe by another steamer ? \" asked Vansittart, testing the all-knowing Venetian. \" Not he, Altissimo. Having once set his foot upon the soil of Africa he would be too wise to risk a return to Europe. He might go to India,"], [142, "134 THE VENETIANS. to America \u2014 north or south \u2014 but he would not come to England, to answer for the English life which he had taken. You Englishmen set great store upon life.\" Vansittart dismissed the man with a present, but before he went Ferrari laid his card upon the table, and begged that if ever the illustris simo required a courier or a travelling servant, he, Ferrari, might be remembered. When he was gone Vansittart took up his pen and wrote hastily to Sefton. \"Dear Mr. Sefton, \" Your excellent Ferrari has been here, aud I have gone carefully through his statement. It is plausible, but by no means convincing ; and I see ample room for error in a chain of facts which rest upon hearsay. Under these conditions I am more than ever desirous that no hint of Ferrari's story should reach Miss Mar chant. Forgive me for reminding you of your promise. It would be a deplorable business if this dear girl were made unhappy about a chimera. \" I go to Redwold to-morrow, and shall stay"], [143, "TO LIVE FORGOTTEN AND LOVE FORLORN. 135 over Whitsuntide. We are to be married before the end of June, very quietly, at Fernhurst Church. \" Yours sincerely, \"J. Vansittart.\" He rather despised himself for writing in this friendly strain to a man for whom he had an instinctive dislike ; but he tried to believe that his dislike was mere prejudice, and that Mr. Sefton's manner with Eve, to which he- had taken such violent objection, was only Mr. Sefton's manner to young women in general ; a bad manner, but without any sinister feeling underlying it \u2014 only a bad manner. To-morrow he was to go to Redwold, to be his sister's guest till after Whitsuntide, or until the wedding, if he pleased. And before June was pushed aside by her sultrier sister July, he was to be Eve Marchant's husband. Every day of his life brought that union a day nearer. It had come now to the counting of days. It seemed to him as if time and the calendar were no more \u2014 as if he and his love were being swept along in the strong current of their happiness. He could"], [144, "136 THE VENETIANS. think of nothing, care for nothing but Eve. ' His bailiff's letters, his lawyer's letters, remained unanswered. He could not bring himself even to consider his mother's suggestions as to this or that improvement or alteration at Merewood, whither Mrs. Vansittart was going at Whitsun tide, to prepare all things for the coming of the bride, and to arrange for her own removal. \" Do as much or as little as you like, mother,\" Vansittart said. \" You need alter nothing. Eve will be pleased with things as they are.\" \"It will be a great change for her from a cottage,\" sighed Mrs. Vansittart. \" I'm afraid she will be bewildered and overpowered by a large household. She can have no idea of managing servants.\" \" The servants can manage themselves, mother. I don't want a managing wife. Yet from what I have seen of Eve in her own home I take her to be well up in domestic matters. Everything at the Homestead seemed the essence of comfort.\" He remembered his wintry tea-drinking, the tea and toast, the cake and jam-pots, and Eve's radiant face ; the firelight on Eve's hair ; the sense of quiet happiness which pervaded the"], [145, "137 TO LIVE FORGOTTEN AND LOVE FORLORN. place where his love was queen. It seemed to him that there could not have been one inhar monious note in that picture. Order and beauty and domestic peace were there. Should Fate reduce him to poverty he could be utterly happy with his love in just such a home. He wanted neither splendid surroundings nor brilliant society. Having heard all that Ferrari could tell him, he felt easier in his mind than he had felt since that unpleasant hour with his mother and Sefton on Saturday evening. The more he thought of the courier's chain of evidence, the weaker it seemed to him. No, he could not think that the man he had killed was the brother of the woman he was going to marry. He tried to recall the man's face ; but the suddenness and the fury of that brief encounter had afforded no time for minute observation. The man's face had flashed upon him out of the crowd \u2014 fair-haired, fair skinned ; Saxon amidst all those olive com plexions \u2014 a face and figure that bore down upon him with the impression of physical power ; handsome only as the typical gladiator is hand some. What more could he remember ? Irre-"], [146, "138 THE VENETIANS. gular features, strongly marked ; a low forehead ; and light blue eyes. The Marchants were a blue-eyed race, but that went for little in a country where the majority of eyes are blue or grey. Vansittart remembered his promise to visit Fiordelisa and her aunt ; and as this was his last day in London, perhaps, for some time \u2014 since London was but a wilderness of brick now Eve was gone \u2014 he gave up his afternoon to the per formance of that promise. Tuesday was one of the Professor's days ; and he had promised to see the Professor and hear his opinion of Signora Vivanti's progress. Since that painful hour on Saturday he had thought much and seriously of the impulsive Venetian, and of his relations with her \u2014 relations which he felt to be full of peril. It had occurred to him that there was only one way to secure Fiordelisa's future welfare, while strictly main taining his own incognito, and that was by the purchase of an annuity. It would cost him some thousands to capitalize that income of two hundred a year, which he had resolved to allow Lisa ; but he had reserves which he could afford"], [147, "139 TO LIVE FORGOTTEN AND LOVE FORLORN. to draw upon, the accumulations of his minority, at present invested in railway stock. Any lesser sacrifice would appear to him too poor an atone ment ; for after all, it was possible that, but for him, Fiordelisa's Englishman might have kept his promise and married her. No, Vansittart did not think he would be doing too much in securing these two women against poverty for the rest of their lives \u2014 and the annuity once bought he would be justified in disappearing out of Fiorde lisa's life, and leaving her in ignorance of his name and belongings. He spent an hour with his lawyer before going to Chelsea, and from that gentleman obtained all needful information as to the proper manner of purchasing an annuity, and the best people with whom to invest his money. This done, he walked across the Park, and arrived at Saltero's Mansion on the stroke of four. Lisa had told him that her lesson lasted from three to four, so he had timed himself to meet the maestro. The ripe round notes of Lisa's mezzo soprano rose full and strong in one of Conconi's exercises"], [148, "140 THE VENETIANS. as la Zia opened the door. She attacked a florid passage with force and precision, ran rapidly up the scale to A sharp, and held the high note long and clear as the call of a bird. \"Brava, brava,\" cried Signor Zinco, banging down a chord and rising from the piano as Van sittart entered. Lisa flew to meet him. She was in her plain black frock, with no collar, only a bit of scarlet ribbon tied round her throat, and another bit of scarlet tying up her great untidy knot of blue black hair. The rusty black gown, the scarlet ribbons, the olive face, with its carnation flush and star-like eyes, made a brilliant picture after the school of Murillo. Vansittart could but see that she was strikingly handsome \u2014 just the kind of woman to take the town by storm, if she were once seen and heard in opera bouffe. Zinco was a little old man, short and fat, with no more figure than an eighteen-gallon cask. He had a large bald head, and benevolent eyes. He was very shabby. His coat, which might once have been black, was now a dull green \u2014 his old grey trousers were kneed and frayed, his old fat hands were dirty."], [149, "141 TO LIVE FORGOTTEN AND LOVE FORLORN. \" Ah, I thought you had forgotten me again,\" said Lisa. \" But you are here at last ; and now ask the master if he is pleased with me.\" \" I am more than pleased,\" began Zinco, bowing and smiling at Vansittart as one who would fain have prostrated himself at the feet of so exalted a patron. \" Stay,\" cried Lisa. \" You shall not talk of me before my face. I will go and make the tea \u2014 and then Zinco will tell you the truth, Si'or mio, the very truth about me. He will not be obliged to praise.\" She dashed out of the room, as if blown out on a strong wind, so impetuous were her move ments. La Zia began to clear a table for tea, a table heaped with sheets of music and play books. Fiordelisa had been learning English out of Gilbert's librettos, which were harder work for her than Metastasio for an English student. \" Well, Signor Zinco, what do you think of your pupil ? \" asked Vansittart. \" Sir, she is of a marvellous natural. She has an enormous talent, and with that talent an enormous energy. She is destined to a pro digious success upon the English scene.\""], [150, "142 THE VENETIANS. \" I am delighted to hear it.\" \" She has all the qualities which succeed with j7our English people \u2014 a fine voice, a fine person, and pardon me if I add, an audacity, a vulgarity which will command applause. Were I more diplomatist I should say genius \u2014 where I say vulgarity \u2014 but this divine creature is adorably vulgar. She has no nerves. I say to her sing, and she sings. ' Attack me the A sharp,' and she attacks, and the note rings out like a bell. She is without nerves, and she is without self- consciousness, and she has the courage of a lion. She has worked as no pupil of mine ever worked before. She is mastering your difficult language in as many months as it cost me years. She has laboured at the theory of music, and though she is in most things of a surprising ignorance, she has made no mean progress in that difficult science. She has worked as Garcia's gifted daughter worked ; and were this age worthy of a second Malibran, she has in her the stuff to make a Malibran.\" The fat little maestro stopped for breath, not for words. He stood mopping his forehead and smiling at Vansittart, who was inclined to believe"], [151, "143 TO LIVE FORGOTTEN AND LOVE FORLORN. in his sincerity, for that roulade he had heard at the door just now displayed a voice of brilliant quality. \" You are enthusiastic, Signor Zinco,\" he said quietly. \" And pray when you have trained this fine voice to the uttermost what do you intend to do with it ? \" \" I hope to place the Signora in the way of making her fortune. Were you English a nation of music lovers, I should say to this dear lady, give yourself up to hard study of classical opera for the next three years, before you allow your self to be heard in public ; but pardon me if I say, Signor, you English are not connoisseurs. You are taken with show and brilliancy. You think more of youth and beauty in the prima donna than of finish or deep feeling in the singer. Before your winter season of opera bouffe shall begin the Signora will have learnt enough to ensure her a succes sou. I count upon getting her engaged at the Apollo Theatre in November. There is a new opera being written for the Apollo \u2014 an opera in which I am told there are several female characters, and there will be a chance for a new singer. I have already spoken to the"], [152, "144 THE VENETIANS. manager of the Apollo, and he has promised to hear the Signora sing before concluding his autumn engagements.\" \" Festina lente, Signor Zinco.

You have had so many sham Italians in opera that it will be well to have a real one.\" The Maestro bowed himself out, as Fiordelisa came in with the tea-tray7, beaming with smiles, happy and important. She placed a chair for Vansittart by the open window. She arranged the light bamboo table in front of him, and began to pour out the tea, while la Zia seated herself at a little distance. \" I have learnt to make tea in your English fashion,\" Lisa said gaily, as she handed the tea cups. \" Strong, oh, so strong.

He is a bold, bad boy, and so full of mischief,\" said Lisa, with evident pride. \" He is very big for his age, people say, and as active as a monkey. You must go and fetch him directly you have had your tea, Carina mia,\" she added to her aunt. \" He has been with those children nearly two hours. He will be awake all night with excite ment.\" \" Is he excitable ? \" asked Vansittart, who felt a new and painful interest in this child of a nameless parent. \" Oh, he is terrible. He is ready to jump out of the window when he is happy. He throws himself down on the floor, and kicks and screams till he is black in the face, when he is not allowed to do what he likes. He is only a baby, and yet he is our master. That is because he is a man, I suppose. We were created to be your slaves, were we not, Si'or mio ?

I forgot. I ought not to have spoken of him. I never will speak of him again. We will forget that he ever existed.\" She hung over his chair. She took up his hand and kissed it. \" Forgive me ! Forgive me ! \" she murmured, with tears. Unmoved by this little scene, La Zia emptied her teacup, rose, and left the room ; and they two \u2014 Vansittart and Fiordelisa \u2014 were alone. \" You know that I would not pain you for the world,\" she sighed. \" You have been so good to me, my true and only friend.\" \" No, no, Si'ora ; I know that you would not willingly recall that memory which is branded"], [156, "148 THE VENETIANS. deep upon my heart and brain.

The girl looked at him for a moment, clenched her teeth, clenched her hands, and made a rush for the balcony. Happily he was quick enough and strong enough to stop her with one outstretched arm. He took her by the shoulder, savagely almost, with something of the brutal roughness of her old lover it might be, but with no love. Beautiful as she was in her passionate self abandonment, he felt nothing for her in that moment but an angry contempt, which he was at little pains to conceal. The revulsion of feeling upon that wild impulse towards self-destruction came quickly enough. The tears rolled down her flushed cheeks, she sank into the chair towards which Vansittart led her, and sat, helpless and unresisting, with her hands hanging loose across the arms of the chair, her head drooping on her breast, the picture of helpless grief. He could but pity her, seeing her so childlike, so unreasoning, swayed by passion as a lily is bent by the wind. He shut the window, and"], [161, "153 TO LIVE FORGOTTEN AND LOVE FORLORN. bolted it, against any second outbreak ; and then he seated himself at Lisa's side and took one of those listless hands in his. \" Les us be reasonable, Si'ora,\" he said, \" and let us be good friends always. If I were not in love with a young English lady whom I hope very shortly to make my wife I might have fallen in love with you.\" She gave a melancholy smile, and then a deep sigh. \" No, no, impossible ! You would never have cared. I am too low \u2014 the mother of Paolo \u2014 only fit to be your servant.\" \"Love pardons much, Lisa; and if my heart had not been given to another your beauty and your frank generous nature might have won me. Only my heart was gone before that night at Covent Garden. It belonged for ever and for ever to my dear English love.\" \" Your English love !

Love is destiny.\" \" Your destiny was in the past, Lisa. It came to you at Burano.\" \"No, no, no. I never cared for him as I have cared for you. I was happier in that one day on the Lido, and that one evening in Venice, than in all my life with him.

You are my destiny.\" \" You will think the same about some one else by-and-by, Si'ora \u2014 some one whose heart will be free to love you as you deserve to be loved.

It is for that you have been working so hard.\" \" No, it is not for that. I have been working only to please you ; so that you should say by and-by, ' This poor little Lisa, for whom I have taken trouble and spent money, is something more than a common lace-worker, after all.' \" \" This poor little Lisa is a genius, I believe, and will have the world at her feet, by-and-by.

I promise anything in this world rather than not see you.\" \" If I come, be sure I shall come as your true and loyal friend. Ah, here is your son,\" as a babyish prattle made itself heard in the little vestibule. First came a rattling of the handle, and then the door was durst open, and Paolo rushed in \u2014 a sturdy block of a boy, with flaxen hair and great black eyes \u2014 a curious compromise between the Saxon father and the Venetian mother ; square shouldered, sturdy, stolid, yet with flashes of southern impetuousness. He was big for his age, very big, standing straight and strong upon the legs of an infant Hercules. He excelled in everything but speech. Vansittart lifted him in his arms, and looked long and earnestly into the cherubic countenance, which first smiled and then frowned at him. He was trying, in this living picture of the dead, to"], [165, "TO LIVE FORGOTTEN AND LOVE FORLORN. 157 see whether he could discover any trace of the Marchant lineaments. It might be that a foregone conclusion prompted the fancy \u2014 that the fear of seeing made him see \u2014 but in the turn of the eyebrow aud the contour of cheek and chin he thought he recognized lines which were familiar to him in the faces of Eve and her sisters \u2014 lines which were not in Fiordelisa's face. He set the boy down with a sigh. \" Don't spoil him, Signora,\" he said to la Zia. \" He looks like a boy with a good disposition, but a strong temper. He will want judicious training by-and-by.\" Lisa followed him to the vestibule, and opened the door for him. \" Tell me that you are not angry before you go,\" she said imploringly. \" Angry ? No, no ; how could I be angry ? I am only sorry that you should waste so much warmth of feeling on a man whose heart belongs to some one else.\" \" What is she like \u2014 that some one else ?

It was the season of hawthorn blossom, and an undulating line of white may bushes came dancing down the hill like a bridal procession. It was the season of blue-bells ; and all the woodland hollows were lakelets of azure bloom, luminous in sunlight, darkly purple in shadow ;"], [172, "164 THE VENETIANS. the season of blossoming trees in cottage gardens, of the laburnum's golden rain, the acacia's per fumed whiteness, the tossing balls of the guelder rose, the mauve blossoms of wistaria glorifying the humblest walls, the small white woodbine scenting the balmy air. It was a season that seemed especially invented for youth and love ; for the young foals sporting in the meadow ; for the young lambs on the grassy hills ; and for Eve and Vansittart. They almost lived out of doors in this delicious weather. The four sisters were always ready to bear them company, and were always discreet enough to leave them alone for the greater part of every rambling expedition. Mr. Tivett had reappeared on the scene. He had been particu larly useful in London, where he was full of information about the very best places for buy ing everything, from a diamond bracelet to a tooth-brush, and had insisted upon taking Eve and Lady Hartley to some of his favourite shops, and upon having a voice in a great many of their purchases. He took as much interest in Eve's trousseau as if he had been her maiden aunt. The wedding was to be the simplest ceremonial"], [173, "\"MORE FAIR THAN WORDS CAN SAY.\" 165 possible. Neither Vansittart nor Eve wished to parade their bliss before a light-minded multitude. The Homestead was not a house in which to entertain a mixed company; and Colonel Marchant was not a man to make a fuss about anything in life except his own comfort. He ordered a frock-coat, and got himself a new hat for the occasion ; and the faithful Yorkshire Nancy, cook, housekeeper, and general manager, toiled for a week of industrious days in order that the house might be in faultless order, and the light collation worthy of the chosen who were invited to the wedding. There were to be no hired waiters, no stereotyped banquet from the confectioner's, only tea and coffee, cham pagne of a famous brand \u2014 upon this the Colonel insisted \u2014 and such cakes and biscuits and delicate sandwiches as Nancy knew well how to prepare. For bridesmaids, Eve had her four sisters, all in white frocks, and carrying big bunches of Marechal Niel roses. Hetty and Peggy had been in ecstatic expectation of the day for a month, and full of speculation as to what manner of present the bridegroom would give them. They squabbled about this question"], [174, "166 THE VENETIANS. almost every night at bedtime, under the sloping roof of the attic which they occupied together, close to the overhanging thatch where there was such a humming and buzzing of summer insects in the June mornings. \" He is bound to give us a present,\" said Peggy. \" It's etiquette \" \u2014 accentuating the first syllable. \"You should say etiquette,\" reproved Hetty7. \" Lady Hartley lays a stress upon the kett.\" \" Don't bother about pronounciation,\" muttered Peggy ; \" one can never get on with one's talk when you're so fine-ladyfied.\" \" Pronounciation ! \" cried Hetty. \" You pick up your language from Susan. No wonder Sophy is horrified at you.\" \" Sophy is too fine for anything. Mr. Van sittart said so yesterday when she gave herself airs at the picnic, because there were no table napkins. I wonder what the present will be ! He's so rich, he's sure to give us something pretty. Suppose he gives us watches ? \" A watch was the dream of Peggy's life.

Of course, the brides maids are supposed1 to have watches. Their fathers give them watches directly they are in their teens, unless they are hard-up, like our father. I shouldn't wonder if he were to give us diamond arrow brooches.\" Hetty had seen a diamond arrow in Lady Hartley's bonnet-strings, and had conceived a passion for that form of ornament. \"What do you bet that it will be diamond arrows ? \" \" There's no use in betting with you. If you lose, one never gets paid.\" \"I don't often have any money,\" Peggy replied naively ; and then came a knocking at the lath and plaster partition, and Sophy's sharp voice remonstrating \u2014 \"Are you children never going to leave off chattering? You are worse than the swallows in the morning.\" There was one blissfullest of days for Peggy during the week before the wedding, a balmy"], [176, "168 THE VENETIANS. June morning on which Vansittart came in a dog-cart to take Eve and her youngest sister to Haslemere station, whence the train carried them through a smiling land, perfumed with bean blossoms and those fragrant spices which pine woods exhale under the summer sun, to Liss, where another dog-cart was waiting for them, and whence they drove past copse and common to Merewood, Vansittart's very own house, to which he brought his future wife on a visit of inspection \u2014 \" to see if she would like any alterations,\" he said. \" As if any one could want to alter such a lovely house,\" exclaimed Peggy, who was allowed to run about and pry into every hole and corner, and open all the wardrobes and drawers, except in Mrs. Vansittart's rooms, where everything was looked at with an almost religious reverence.

I think it is because she has never left off struggling to be smart, never left off thinking that we ought to be on the same level as the county families ; while Jenny and I gave up the battle at once, and confessed to each other frankly that we were poor and shabby, and the daughters of a scampish father. And so we have managed to be happy.

It was a garden shut in by walls of cypress and yew, and so secluded as to make an al fresco drawing-room for summer habitation ; a drawing-room in which one could breakfast or dine, without fear of being espied by any one approaching the hall door. Eve was enchanted with her new home. She poured out her confidence to him who was so soon to be her husband, with the right to know her inmost thoughts, her every impulse or fancy. It was not often that she talked of herself; but to-day she was full of personal reminiscences, and Vansittart encouraged her innocent egotism. \" I don't think you realize that you are play ing the part of King Cophetua, and marrying a beggar-maiden,\" she said. \"I don't think you can have any idea what a struggle my life has been since I was twelve years old \u2014 how that dear Nancy and I have had to scheme and manage, in order to feed four hungry girls.

Perhaps in every man's life there comes one such ordeal as that \u2014 love cast at his feet, love worthless to him ; but true love all the same, and the most precious of all earthly feelings in the abstract. Eve Marchant's wedding gifts were few but costly. She had no wide circle of friends and acquaintances to shower feather fans and ivory paper-knives, standard lamps and silver boxes, teapots and cream-jugs, fruit spoons and carriage clocks upon her, till she sat among her treasures, bewildered and oppressed, like Tarpeia under the rain of iron from rude warrior hands. Neigh bours had stood aloof from the family at the Homestead, and could hardly come to the front with gifts in their hands, now that the slighted girl was going to marry a man of some standing in an adjoining county, and to take her place for ever among the respectabilities. The givers therefore were few, but the gifts were worthy. Mrs. Vansittart gave the pearl necklace which she had worn at her own bridal \u2014 a single string"], [184, "176 THE VENETIANS. of perfect pearls, with a diamond clasp that had been in the family for a century and a half. Lady Hartley gave her future sister-in-law a set of diamond stars worthy to blaze in the fashionable firmament on a Drawing-Room day. Sir Hubert gave a three-quarter bred mare of splendid shape and remarkable power, perfect as hack or hunter, on whose back Eve had already taken her first lessons in equitation. And for the bridegroom ! His gifts were of the choicest and the best con sidered; jewels, toilet necessaire, travelling bag, books innumerable. He watched for every want, anticipated every fancy. \" Pray, pray don't spoil me,\" cried Eve. \" You make me feel so horribly selfish. You load me with gifts, and you say you are not rich. You are ruining yourself for me.\" \" A man can afford to ruin himself once in his life for his nearest and dearest,\" he answered gaily. \" Besides, if I give you all you want now, I shall cure you of any incipient tendency to extravagance.\" \" I have no such tendency. My nose has been kept too close to the grindstone of poverty.\" \" Poor, pretty little nose ! Happily the grind stone has not hurt it.\""], [185, "\"MORE FAIR THAN WORDS CAN SAY.\" 177 \" And as for wants, who said I wanted Tenny son and Browning bound in vellum, or a travel ling bag as big as a house?

Eve's appearance in the family sitting-room just a little later than usual one morning was loudly hailed by Hetty and Peggy, who were squabbling over a small parcel which had arrived, registered and insured, by the morning post. \"It is a jeweller's box in the shape of a crescent,\" cried Peggy. \" It must be a crescent brooch. How too utterly lovely ! But it is not from Mr. Vansittart.\" VOL. II. N"], [186, "178 THE VENETIANS. They called him Mr. Vansittart still, although he had begged them to call him Jack. \"It would be too awfully free and easy to call so superb a gentleman by such a vulgar name,\" Hetty said, when the subject came under discussion. \"I say it is from Mr. Vansittart,\" protested Hetty. \" Who else would send her a diamond crescent?\" \" How do you know it's diamonds ? \" \" Oh, of course. Bridegrooms always give diamonds. Did you ever see anything else in the weddings in the Lady's Pictorial ? \" \" Bother the Lady's Pictorial ! it ain't his handwriting.\" \" Ain't it, stupid ? Who said it was ? It's the jeweller's writing, of course \u2014 with Mr. Van sittart's card inside.\" \" Perhaps you will allow me to open the parcel, and see what it all means,\" said Eve, with the eldest sister's dignity. The two young barbarians had had the break fast-table to themselves, Sophy and Jenny not having appeared. There were certain operations with spirit-lamp and tongs which made these"], [187, "\"MORE FAIR THAN WORDS CAN SAY.\" 179 young ladies later than the unsophisticated juniors. \"I shall scold him savagely for sending me this, after what I told him yesterday,\" said Eve, as she tore open the carefully sealed parcel. She was of Hetty's opinion. The gift could be from none but her lover. \" Oh, oh, oh ! \" they cried, all three of them, in a chorus of rapture, as the box was opened. The crescent was of sapphires, deeply, darkly, beautifully blue, without flaw or feather. Small brilliants filled in the corners between the stones, but these hardly showed in that blue depth and darkness. The effect \"was of a solemn, almost mysterious splendour. It was a jewel such as Cleopatra might have worn, clasping a mantle of white and gold upon a peerless bust. It was beautiful enough for the loveliest wearer, costly enough for the greatest among royal ladies. \" Oh, how wicked, how wilful of him, to waste such a fortune upon me ! \" cried Eve, taking the crescent out of its white velvet bed. Under the jewel, like the asp under the fig leaves, there lay a visiting-card. \" From Mr. Sefton, with all best wishes."], [188, "180 THE VENETIANS. Eve dropped the brooch as if it had stung her. \" From him ? \" she cried. \" How horrid ! \" \" I call it utterly charming of him,\" protested Hetty, who had adopted as many of Lady Hartley's phrases as her memory would hold. \" We all know that he admired you, and I think it too sweet of him to show that he bears no malice now that you are marrying somebody else. Had he sent you anything paltry \u2014 fish knives or a scent-bottle, for instance \u2014 I should have loathed him. But such a present as this, so simple yet so distingue, in such perfect taste \" \" Cease your raptures, Hetty, for mercy's sake ! \" cried Eve, wrapping the jewel-box in the crumpled paper, and tying the string round it rather roughly. \" Would you accept any gift from a man you hate ? \" \"It would depend upon the gift. I wouldn't advise my worst enemy to try me with a sapphire crescent \u2014 such sapphires as those ! \" \" You are a mighty judge of sapphires ! \" said Eve, contemptuously ; after which unkind re mark she ate her breakfast of bread and butter and home-made marmalade in moody silence."], [189, "\"MORE FAIR THAN WORDS CAN SAY.\" 181 And it was a rare thing for Eve to be silent or moody. Vansittart's step was heard upon the gravel before the curling-tongs were done with in the upper story, and Eve ran out to the porch to meet him, with the jeweller's parcel in her hand. They walked about the garden together, between rows of blossoming peas and feathery asparagus, by borders of roses and homely pinks, talking of Sefton and his gift. Eve wanted to send it back to the giver. \"I can decline it upon the ground that I don't approve of wedding presents except from one's own and one's bridegroom's kindred,\" she said. \" I won't be uncivil.\" \" I fear he would think the return of his gift uncivil, however sweetly you might word your refusal. Wedding gifts are such a customary business ; it is an unheard-of act to send one back. No, Eve, I fear you must keep the thing,\" with a tone of disgust ; \"but you need not wear it.\" \" Wear it ! I should think not ! Of course I shall obey you ; but I hate the idea of being under an obligation to Mr. Sefton, who \u2014 well,"], [190, "182 THE VENETIANS. who always made me feel more than any one else that I wasn't one of the elect.

I wouldn't for the world do anything to make Lady Hartley feel uncomfortable. He might go to her and tax her with having an unmannerly young woman for a sister-in-law. So I suppose I must write a pretty little formal letter to thank him for his most exquisite gift, the perfect taste of which is only equalled by his condescension in remem bering such an outsider as Colonel Marchant's daughter. Something to that effect, but not quite in those words.\" She broke into gay laughter, the business being settled, and lifted herself on tiptoe to offer her rosy lips to Vansittart's kiss ; and all the invisible fairies in the peaseblossom, and all the microscopic Cupids lurking among the rose leaves, beheld that innocent kiss and laughed their noiseless laugh in sympathy with these true lovers."], [191, "\"MORE FAIR THAN WORDS CAN SAY.\" 183 \" I have a good mind,\" said Eve, as she ran back to the house, \" to give Peggy the blue crescent to fasten her pinafore.\" The wedding at Fernhurst Cottage was as pretty a wedding as any one need care to see, although it was a ceremony curtailed of all those surroundings which make weddings worthy to be recorded in the Society papers. There was no crowd of smart people, no assemblage of smart gowns stamped with the man mantua-maker's cachet, and marking the latest development of fashion. No long train of carriages choked the narrow rural road, or filled the little valley with clouds of summer dust. Only the kindred of bride and bridegroom were present ; but even these made a gracious groap in the village church, while the music of the rustic choir and the school children with their baskets of roses were enough to give a joyous and bridal aspect to the scene. Eve, in her severely simple satin gown, with no ornaments save the string of pearls round her full firm throat, and the natural orange blossoms in her bright hair, was a vision of youthful grace and beauty that satisfied every eye, and made"], [192, "184 THE VENETIANS. the handsome bridegroom in all his height, and breadth, and manly strength, a mere accessory, hardly worth notice. The four sisters, in their gauzy white frocks and Gainsborough hats, when clustered in a group at the church door, might have suggested four cherubic heads looking out of a fleecy cloud, so fresh and bright were the young faces, in the unalloyed happiness of the occasion \u2014 happiness almost supernal, for in defiance of conventionality, and perhaps divining, or overhearing, Peggy's desire, the bridegroom had given them watches, dainty little watches, with an \" E \" in brilliants upon each golden back \u2014 E, for Eve ; E, for Ecstasy ; E, for Ever lasting bliss !

He did all that was required of him with the grace of a man who, in a long association with scamps, had not forgotten the habits of good society. The modest collation at the Homestead was a success ; for everybody was in good spirits and good appetite. Even Mrs. Vansittart was now content with a marriage which gave her son so fair and lovable a bride, content to believe that, whatever evil Harold Marchant might have done upon the earth, no shadow from his dark past need ever fall across his innocent sister's pathway. And so in a great clash of joy bells, and in a shower of rice from girlish hands, Eve and Vansittart ran down the steep garden path to the carriage which was to take them to Haslemere, whence they were going to Salisbury, on the first stage of their journey to that rock-bound coast \" Where that great vision of the guarded mount Looks o'er Nauiancos and Bayona's hold.\""], [194, "186 THE VENETIANS. CHAPTER VIII. \"THE SHADOW PASSETH WHEN THE TREE SHALL FALL.\" What a happy honeymoon it was, along the porphyry walls of Western England ; what joyous days that were so long and seemed so short to those two revellers in the sea, and the sunshine, and the scent of those poor wild flowers that grow on the lips of the ocean. There never was a less costly honeymoon, for the bride's tastes were simple to childishness, and the bridegroom was too deeply in love to care for anything she did not desire. To ramble on that romantic shore, staying here a few days, and there a week, all along the wild north coast, from Tintagel to St. Ives, southward then to Penzance, and Fal mouth, and Fowey, was more than enough for bliss. And yet in all Eve's childish talk with her sisters of what she would do if ever she"], [195, "187 THE SHADOW PASSETH married a rich man, the honeymoon tour in Italy had been a leading feature in her programme ; but in those girlish visions beside the school-room fire the husband had been a nonentity, a mere purse-bearer, and all her talk had been of the places she was to see. Now, with this very real husband, fondly, poetically dear, all earth was paradisaic, and Penzance was not one whit less lovely than Naples. She was exquisitely happy ; and what can the human mind require beyond perfect bliss ? These wedded lovers lingered long over that summer holiday. It was a glorious summer \u2014 a summer of sunshine and cloudless skies, varied only by the inevitable thunderstorm \u2014 tempest enjoyed by Vansittart and Eve, who loved Nature in her grand and awful as well as in her milder aspects \u2014 and a tempest from the heights above Boscastle, or from the grassy cliffs of the Lizard, is a spectacle to remember. They spun out the pleasures of that simple Cornish tour. There was nothing to call them home \u2014 no tie, no duty, only their own inclination ; for the dowager Mrs. Vansittart was staying at Redwold, absorbed in worship of the third generation, and was to go"], [196, "188 THE VENETIANS. from Redwold to Ireland for a round of visits to the friends of her early married life. The lovers were therefore free to prolong their wanderings, and it was only when the shortening days suggested fireside pleasures that Vansittart pro posed going home. \" Going home,\" cried Eve ; \" how sweet that sounds. To think that your home is to be my home for evermore; and the servants, your old, well-trained servants, will be bobbing to me as their mistress \u2014 I who never had any servant but dear old motherly Nancy, who treats me as if I were her own flesh and blood, and an untaught chit for a parlour-maid, a girl who was always dropping knives off her tray, or smashing the crockery, in a most distracting manner. We had only the cheapest things we could buy at White ley's sales, with a few relics of former splendour; and it was generally the relics that suffered. I cannot imagine myself the mistress of a fine house, with a staff of capable servants. What au insignificant creature I shall seem among them ! \" \" You will seem a queen \u2014 a queen out of the great kingdom of poetry \u2014 a queen like Tenny son's Maud, in a white frock, with roses in your"], [197, "189 THE SHADOW PASSETH. hair, and an ostrich fan for a sceptre. Don't worry about the house, Eve. It will govern itself. The servants are all old servants, and have been trained by my mother, whose laws are the laws of Draco.

We care only for ourselves ; we think only of ourselves.\" \"Oh, we can mend that in some wise. I'll introduce you to all my cottage tenants ; and you will find plenty of scope for your benevolence in helping them through their troubles and sick nesses.

You shall be Lady Bountiful \u2014 a young and blooming Bountiful \u2014 not dealing in herbs and medicines, but in tea, and wine, and sago puddings, and chicken broth ; finding frocks for the children, and Sunday bonnets for the mothers \u2014 flashing across poverty's threshold like a ray of sunshine.\" Life that seems like a happy dream seldom"], [198, "190 THE VENETIANS. lasts very long. There is generally some kind of rough awakening. Fate comes like the servant bidden to call us of a morning, and shakes the sleeper by the shoulder. The happy dream vanishes through the ivory gate, aud the waking world in all its harsh reality is there. Eve's awakening came in a most unexpected shape. It came one October morning in the first week of her residence at Merewood. It came in a letter from the old servant Nancy, a letter in a shabby envelope, lying hidden among that heap of letters, monogrammed, coronetted, fashionable, which lay beside Mrs. Vansittart's plate when she took her seat at the breakfast table. She left that letter for the last, not recognizing Nancy's penmanship, an article of which the faithful servant had always been sparing. Eve read all those other trivial letters \u2014 invitations, acceptances, friendly little communications of no meaning \u2014 and commented upon them to her husband as he took his breakfast \u2014 and then finally she opened Nancy's letter. It was October, and Vansittart was dressed for shooting. October, yet there was no house-party. Eve had pleaded for a little more of that dual solitude"], [199, "191 THE SHADOW PASSETH. which husband and wife had both found so de lightful ; and Vansittart had been nothing loth to indulge her whim. November would be time enough to invite his friends ; and in the mean time they had their pine woods and copses and common all to themselves ; and Eve could tramp about the covers with him when he went after his pheasants, without feeling herself in anybody's way. October had begun charmingly, with weather that was balmy and bright enough for August. They were breakfasting with windows open to the lawn and flower-beds, and the bees were buzzing among the dahlias, and the air was scented with the Dijon roses that covered the wall. \" Why, it is from Nancy,\" exclaimed Eve, look ing at the signature. \" Dear old Nancy. What can she have to write about ? \" \" Read, Eve, read,\" cried Vansittart. \" I be lieve Nancy's letter will be more interesting than all those inanities you have been reading to me. There is sure to be some touch of originality, even if it is only in the spelling.\" Eve's eyes had been hurrying over the letter while he spoke."], [200, "192 THE VENETIANS. \" Oh, Jack,\" she exclaimed, in a piteous voice, \" can there be any truth in this ? \" The letter was as follows, in an orthography which need not be reproduced : \u2014 \" Honoured Madam, \" I should not take the liberty to write to you about dear Miss Peggy, only at Miss Sophy's and Miss Jenny's age they can't be ex pected to know anything about illness, and I'm afraid they may pass things over till it's too late to mend matters, and then I know y6u would blame your old servant for not having spoken out.\" \"What an alarming preamble,\" said Jack. \" What does it all mean ? \" \" It means that Peggy is very ill. Peggy, who seemed the strongest of all of us.\" She went on reading the letter. \"You know what beautiful weather we had after your marriage, honoured Madam.

But Miss Peggy she used to run about more than her sisters, and she used to get into dreadful perspirations, as Miss Hetty told me afterwards, and then, standing or sitting about upon those windy hills, no doubt she got a chill.

She was far away from us when she died. I remember she always had a cough in the winter, and she had to be very careful of herself \u2014 or, at least, people told her she ought to be careful.

And now, dearest, your hat and jacket, and I am with you.\" There was comfort in this prompt action. Eve tore upstairs, threw on the first hat she could find, too eager to ring for her maid, with whose attendance she was always willing to dispense, as an altogether novel and not always pleasant sensation. She came flying down to the hall ten minutes before the cart drove round, and she and Vansittart walked up and down in front of the porch, talking of the sisters, she breathless and with fast-beating heart, protesting more than once at the slowness of the grooms. \" My dearest, for pity's sake be calm.

Yes, she would take comfort. Jack was right. Nancy was the best of creatures, but very apt to dwell upon the darker aspects of life, and to prophesy evil. Yes, Jack was right ; for scarcely had the fly drawn up at the little gate when Peggy came dancing down the steep garden path, with out stretched arms, and wild hair flying in the wind, and legs much too long for her short petticoats, that very Peggy whom Eve's fearful imaginings had depicted stretched on a sick-bed, faint almost to speechlessness.

They"], [208, "200 THE VENETIANS. were rapturous in their greetings, had worlds to say about themselves and their neighbours, and were more eager to talk of their own experiences than to hear about Eve's Cornish wanderings. \" You should just see how the people suck up to us, now you are Lady Hartley's sister-in-law,\" said Hetty, and was immediately silenced for vulgarity, and to make way for her elder sisters. Vansittart left them all clustered about Eve, and all talking together.

It was not to muse upon decaying Nature that Vansittart had come out among the rose and carnation borders, the patches of parsley and mint. He had a purpose in his sauntering, and"], [209, "201 THE SHADOW PASSETH. made his way to the back of the straggling, irregular cottage, where the long-tiled roof of the kitchen and offices jutted out from under the thatch.

You were saying \" I didn't want to frighten your sweet young lady in the midst of her happiness ; but when I saw that dear child beginning to go off just like her poor mother \" \" Oh, Nancy I\" cried Vansittart, despairingly, with his hand on the Yorkshirewoman's arm. \" Is that a sure thing ? Did Mrs. Marchant die of consumption ? \" \" As sure as you and I are standing here, sir. It was a slow decline, but it was consumption, and nothing else. I've heard the doctors say so.\""], [211, "203 CHAPTER IX. \"HE SAID, 'SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.'\" December's fogs covered London as with a funeral pall, and hansom and four-wheeler crept along the curb more slowly than a funeral procession. It was the winter season, the season of cattle shows, and theatres, and middle-class suburban gaieties, and snug little dinners and luncheons in the smart world, casual meetings of birds of passage, halting far a few days between one country visit and another, or preparing for migration to sunnier skies. There were just people enough in Mayfair to make London pleasant ; and there were people enough in South Kensington and Tyburnia to fill the favourite theatres to overflowing. A new comic opera had been produced at the Apollo at the beginning of the month, and a new singer had taken the town by storm."], [212, "204 THE VENETIANS. The opera was called Fanchonette. It was a story of the Regency ; the Regency of Philip of Orleans and his dissipated crew ; the age of red heels and lansquenet, of little suppers and deadly duels ; a period altogether picturesque, profligate, and adapted to comic opera. Fanchonette was a girl who sang in the streets ; a girl born in the gutter, vulgar, audacious, irre sistible, and the good genius of the piece. Fanchonette was Fiordelisa \u2014 and Fiordelisa in her own skin ; good-natured, impetuous, a creature of smiles and tears ; buoyant as a sea gull on the crest of a summer wave ; rejoicing in her strength and her beauty as the Sun rejoiceth to run his race. What people most admired in this new song stress was her perfect abandon, and that abundant power of voice which seemed strong enough to have sustained the most exacting role in the classic repertoire, with as little effort as the light and graceful musie of opera bouffe\u2014 the power of a Malibran or a Tietjens. The music of Fanchonette was florid, and the part had been written up for the new singer. Manager, artists, and author had thought Mr."], [213, "\" HE SAID, ' SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.' \" 205 Mervyn Hawberk, the composer, reckless almost to lunacy when he elected to entrust the leading part in his new opera to an untried singer ; but Hawberk had made Signora Vivanti rehearse the music in his own music-room, not once, but many times, before he resolved upon this experiment ; and having so resolved, he turned her over to Mr. Watling, the author of the libretto, to be coached in the acting of her part; and Mr. Watling was fain to confess that the young Venetian's vivacity and quickness of apprehension, the force and fire, the magnetism of her southern nature, made the work of dramatic education a very different thing to the weary labour of grind ing his ideas into the bread and butter misses who were sometimes sent to him as aspirants for dramatic fame. This girl was so quick to learn and to perceive, and struggled so valiantly with the difficulties of a foreign language. And her Venetian accent, with its soft slurring of con- sonants, was so quaint and pretty. Mr. Watling took heart, and began to think that his friend and partner, Mervyn Hawberk, had some justi fication for his faith in this untried star. The result fully justified Hawberk's confidence,"], [214, "206 THE VENETIANS. There were two principal ladies in the opera \u2014 the patrician heroine, written for a light soprano, and the gutter heroine, a mezzo soprano, whose music made a greater call upon the singer than the former character, which had been written espe cially for the Apollo's established prima donna, a lady with a charming birdlike voice, flexible and brilliant, but a little worn with six years' constant service, and a handsome face which was somewhat the worse for those six years in a London theatre. There could have been no greater contrast to Miss Emmeline Danby, with her sharp nose, blonde hair, sylph-like figure and canary-bird voice, than this daughter of St. Mark, whose splendour of colouring and fulness of form seemed in perfect harmony with the power and compass of her voice. The town, without being tired of Miss Danby, was at once caught and charmed by this new singer. Her blue-black hair and flashing eyes, her easy movements, her broken English, her gay girlish laughter, were all new to the audience of the Apollo, who hitherto had been called upon to applaud only the highest training of voice and person. Here was a girl who, like the character she represented,"], [215, "\"HE SAID, 'SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.'\" 207 had evidently sprung from the proletariat, and who came dancing on to the London stage, fresh, fearless, unsophisticated, secure of the friendly feeling of her audience, and giving full scope to her natural gaiety of heart. Signora Vivanti's personality was a new sensa tion, and to a blase London public there is nothing so precious as a new sensation. Signor Zinco proved a true prophet. That touch of vulgarity which he had spoken of deprecatingly to Vansittart had made Lisa's fortune. Had she come straight from the Milan Conservatorio, cultivated to the highest pitch of artistic training, approved by Verdi himself, she would hardly have succeeded as she had done, with all the rough edges of her grand voice unpolished, and all the little caprices and impertinences of a daughter of the people unchastened and unrestrained. Lisa took the town by storm, and \" Fancho nette,\" in her little mob cap and striped petticoat, appeared on half the match-boxes that were sold by the London tobacconists ; and \" Fanchonette,\" with every imaginable turn of head and shoulder, smiled in the windows of the Stereoscopic Com pany, and of all the fashionable stationers."], [216, "208 THE VENETIANS. Among the many who admired the new singer one of the most enthusiastic was Mr. Sefton, who generally spent a week or two of the early winter in his bachelor quarters at Chelsea, for the express purpose of seeing the new productions at the fashionable theatres, and of dining with his chosen friends. Sefton was passionately fond of music, and knew more about it than is known to most country gentlemen. The loftiest classical school was not too high or too serious for him ; and the lightest opera bouffe was not too low. He had a taste sufficiently catholic to range from Wagner to Offenbach. He was a profound believer in Sullivan, and he had a warm affection for Massenet. Fanchonette was by far the cleverest opera which Mr. Hawberk had written ; and Sefton was at the Apollo on the opening night, charmed with the music, and infinitely amused by the new singer. He went a second, a third, a fourth time during his fortnight in town ; and the oftener he heard the music the better he liked it ; and the oftener he saw Signora Vivanti the more vi Uy was he impressed by her undisciplined graces of"], [217, "\"HE SAID, 'SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.\"' 209 person and manner. She had just that spon taneity which had ever exercised the strongest influence over his mind and fancy. He had passed unmoved through the furnace of the best society, had danced and flirted, and had been on the best possible terms with some of the hand somest women in London, and had yet remained heartwhole. He had never been so near falling in love in all seriousness as with Eve Marchant ; and Eve's chief charm had been her frank girlish ness, her unsophisticated delight in life. Well, he was cured of his passion for Eve, cured by that cold douche of indifference which the young lady had poured upon him ; cured by the feeling of angry scorn which had been evoked by her preference for Vansittart ; for a man who, in worldly position, in good looks, and in culture, Wilfred Sefton regarded as his inferior. He could not go on caring for a young woman who had shown herself so utterly deficient in taste as not to prefer the dubious advances of a Sefton to the honest love of a Vansittart. He dismissed Eve from his thoughts for the time being; but not without prophetic musings upon a day when she might be wearied of her commonplace hus- VOL.

He was thus in a measure fancy free as he lolled in his stall at the Apollo, and listened approvingly to Lisa's full and bell-like tones in the quartette, which was already being played on all the barrel-organs in London, a quartette in which the composer had borrowed the dramatic form of the famous quartette in Bigoletto, and adapted it to a serio comic situation. He was free to admire this exuberant Italian beauty, free to pursue a divinity whom he judged an easy conquest. He and the composer were old friends \u2014 Hawberk being a familiar figure at all artistic gatherings in the artistic suburb of Chelsea \u2014 and from Hawberk Mr. Sefton had heard something of the new prima donna's history. He had been told that she was a daughter of the Venetian people, a lace-maker from one of the islands ; that she had come to London with her aunt, to seek her fortune ; and that her musical training had been accomplished within the space of a year, under the direction of Signor Zinco, the fat little Italian who played the 'cello at the Apollo. Such a history did not suggest inacessible"], [219, "211 \"HE SAID, 'SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.'\" beauty, and there was a touch of originality in it which awakened Sefton's interest. The very name of Venice has a touch of enchantment for some minds ; and Sefton, although a man of the world, was not without romantic yearnings. He was always glad to escape from the beaten way of life. He had been troubled and perplexed from the night of Signora Vivanti's debut by the con viction that he had seen that brilliant face before, and by the inability to fix the when or the where. Yes, that vivid countenance was decidedly familiar. It was the individual and not the type which he knew \u2014 but where and when \u2014 where and when ? The brain did its work in the usual unconscious way, and one night, sitting lazily in his stall, dreamily watching the scene, and the actress whose image seemed to fill the stage to the exclusion of all other figures, the memory of a past rencontre flashed suddenly upon the dreamer. The face was the face of the foreign girl he had seen on the Chelsea Embank ment, hanging upon Vansittart's arm. \" By Heaven, there is something fatal in it,\" thought Sefton. \" Are the threads always to"], [220, "212 THE VENETIANS. cross in the web of our lives ? He has worsted me with Eve ; and now \u2014 now am I to fall deep in love with his cast-off mistress ? \" He had been quick to make inferences from that little scene on the Embankment ; the girl hanging on Vansittart's arm, looking up at him pleadingly, passionately. What could such a situation mean but a love affair of the most serious kind ? Had there been any doubt in Sefton's mind as to the nature of the intrigue Vansittart's evident embarrassment would have settled the question. Mr. Sefton was the kind of man who always thinks the worst about everybody, and prejudice had predisposed him to think badly of Eve's admirer. This idea of the singer's probable relations with Vansittart produced a strong revulsion of feeling. Sefton told himself that his affection was too good to be wasted upon any man's cast off mistress, least of all upon the leavings of a man he disliked. An element of scorn was now mixed with his admiration of the lovely Venetian. Until now he had approached her with deference, sending her a bouquet every evening, with his"], [221, "\"HE SAID, 'SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.'\" 213 card, but making no other advance. But the day after his discovery he sent her a diamond bracelet, and asked with easy assurance to be allowed to call upon her. The bracelet was returned to him, with a stately letter signed Zinco ; a letter wherein the 'cello player begged that his pupil might be spared the annoyance of gifts, which she could but consider as insults in disguise. This refusal stimulated Sefton to renewed ardour. He forgot everything except the rebuff, which had taken him by surprise. He put the bracelet in a drawer of his writing-table, and turned the key upon it with a smile. \" She will be wiser by-and-by,\" he said to himself. He went back to the country next day, and tried to forget Signora Vivanti's eyes, and the thrilling sweetness of her voice, tried to banish that seductive image altogether from his mind, while he devoted himself to the conquest of an untried hunter, a fine bay mare, whose pace was better than her manners, and who showed the vulgar strain in her pedigree very much as Signora Vivanti showed her peasant ancestry."], [222, "214 THE VENETIANS. The season was not a good one, and in the face of a hard frost Sefton had nothing to do but brood upon the image that had taken possession of his fancy. It was only when he found himself amidst the tranquil surroundings of his country seat that he knew the strength of his infatuation for the singer. He looked back upon his life as he strolled round the billiard table, cue in hand, trying a shot now and then yawningly, as the snow came softly down outside the Tudor windows, and gradually blotted out the view of garden and park. He looked back upon his life, wondering whether he had done the best for himself, starting from such an advantageous standpoint ; whether, in his own careless phraseology, he had got change for his shilling. He had always had plenty of money ; he had always been his own master; he had always studied his own pleasure ; aud yet there had been burdens. His first love affair had turned out badly ; so badly that there were people in Sussex who still gave him the cold shoulder on account of that old story. He had admired \u2014 nay, adored \u2014 a good many women since he left"], [223, "\"HE SAID, 'SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.' ' 215 Eton ; but he had never seen the woman for whom he cared to sacrifice his liberty, for whose sake he could bind himself for all his life to come. He knew himself well enough to know that all his passions were short-lived, and that, however deeply he might be in love to-day, satiety might come to-morrow. He was ambitious, and he meant to marry a woman who could bring him increase of fortune and social status. \"He was not to be drifted into matrimony by the caprice of the hour. Much as he had admired Eve Marchant he had never thought of marrying her. A penniless girl with a disreputable father and a bevy of half-educated sisters was no mate for him. He had allowed himself full license in admiring her, and in letting her see that he admired her ; and he had wondered that she should receive that open admiration as anything less than an honour. And then a fool had stepped in to spoil sport \u2014 a besotted fool who took this girl for his wife, careless of her surroundings, defiant of Fate, which might overtake him in the shape of a blackguard brother. He felt only contempt for Vansittart when he thought over the story."], [224, "216 THE VENETIANS. \" He might have been content with his Venetian sweetheart,\" he thought. \" She is ever so much handsomer than Eve, and she obviously adored him ; while that kind of menage has the convenience of being easily got rid of when a man tires of it.\" The snow lay deep on all the country round before nightfall, and Sefton went back to his nest in Chelsea on the following afternoon, and was in a stall at the Apollo in the evening. He tried to persuade himself that the music was the chief attraction. \" Your music is like a vice, Hawberk,\" he told the composer, at a tea-party next day. \" It takes possession of a man's will. I go night after night to hear Fanchonette, though I know I am wasting my time.\" \" Thanks for the doubtful compliment. Fan chonette is a very pretty opera, quite the best thing I have done,\" replied Hawberk, easily ; \" and it is very well sung and acted. The singing is good all round, but Lisa Vivanti is a pearl.\" \" You are enthusiastic,\" said Sefton ; and then smiling at the composer's young wife, who went"], [225, "217 \" HE SAID, ' SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.' \" everywhere with her husband, and whose province was to wear smart frocks and look pretty, \" You must keep your eye upon him, Mrs. Hawberk, lest this Venetian siren should sing as fatal a song as the Lurlei.\" \"No fear,\" cried Hawberk. \" Little Lisa is as straight as an arrow and as good as gold. She lives as quietly as a nun, with a comfortable dragon in the shape of an aunt. She would hardly look at a ripping diamond bracelet which some cad sent her the other day. She just tossed bracelet and letter over to her old singing master, and told him to send it back to the giver. She has no greed of gain, no desire for carriages and horses and fine raiment. She comes to the theatre in a shabby little black frock, and she lives like a peasant on a third floor in this neighbourhood.\" \"That will not last,\" said Sefton. \" Your rara avis will soon realize her own value. The management will be called upon to provide her with a stable and a chef, and diamonds will be accepted freely as fitting tribute to her talents.\" \" I don't believe it. I think she is a genuine, nonest, right-minded young woman, and that she"], [226, "218 THE VENETIANS. will gang her own gait in spite of all counter influences. There may have been some love affair in the past that has sobered her. I think there has been ; for there is a little boy who calls her mother, and for whom she takes no trouble to account. I will vouch for my little Lisa, and I have allowed Mrs. Hawberk to go and see her.\" \" She is quite too sweet,\" assented the lady ; \" so naive, so frank, so fresh, so child-like.\" \" Upon my honour,\" said Hawberk, as his wife fluttered away and was absorbed in a group of acquaintances, \" I believe Vivanti is a good woman, in spite of the little peccadillo in a serge frock and sailor collar.\" \" I am very glad to hear it, for I want you to introduce me to the lady.\" \" Oh, but really now that is just what I don't care about doing. She is keeping herself to herself, and is working conscientiously at her musical education. She is a very busy woman, and she has no idea of society, or its ways and manners. What can she want with such an acquaintance as you ? \" \" Nothing ; but I very much want to know her; and I pledge myself to approach her with"], [227, "\"HE SAID, 'SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.\"' 219 all the respect due to the best woman in England.\" \" To approach her, yes ; I can believe that. No doubt Lucifer approached Eve with all possible courtesy; yet the acquaintance ended badly. I don't see that any good could arise from your acquaintance with my charming Venetian.\" \" I understand,\" said Sefton, with an aggrieved air ; \" she is so charming that you would like to keep her all to yourself.\" \" Oh, come now, that's a very weak thing in the way of sneers,\" exclaimed the composer. \"I hope I am secure from any insinuations of that sort. Look here, Sefton, I'm just a bit afraid of you ; but if you promise to act on the square I'll get my ,wife to send you a card for a Sunday evening, at which I believe she is going to get Vivanti to sing for her. That is always the first thing Lavinia thinks of if I venture to introduce her to a singer.\" \" That would be very friendly of you, and I promise to act on the square. I am not a married man, and I am my own master. If I were desperately in love \""], [228, "220 THE VENETIANS. \" You wouldn't marry a Venetian lace-maker, with a damaged reputation. I know you too well to believe you capable of that sort of thing.\" \" Nobody knows of what a man is capable ; least of all the man himself,\" said Sefton, sententiously. Mr. and Mrs. Hawberk lived in a smart little house in that dainty and artistic region of Cheyne Walk, which even yet retains a faint flavour of Don Saltero, of Bolingbroke and Walpole, of Chelsea buns and Chelsea china, Ranelagh routs, and Thames watermen. Mr. Hawberk's house was in a terrace at right angles with the Embankment, but further west than Tite Street. It was a new house, with all the latest improvements, and all the latest fads, tiny panes to Queen Anne windows \u2014 admitting the minimum of light and not overmuch air ; a spacious ingle nook in a miniature dining-room, whereby facetious friends had frequently been heard to ask Mrs. Hawberk which was the ingle nook and which was the dining-room. The house was quaint and pretty, and being entirely furnished with Japaneseries was a very"], [229, "\"HE SAID, 'SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.\"' 221 fascinating toy, if not altogether the most com modious thing in the way of houses. For party giving it was delightful, for less than a hundred people choked every inch of space in rooms and staircase, and suggested a tremendous reception : so that the smallest of Mrs. Hawberk's parties seemed a crush. Sefton arriving at half-past ten, only half an hour after the time on Mrs. Hawberk's card, found the drawing-rooms blocked with people, mostly standing, and could see no more of Signora Vivanti than if she had been on the other side of the river ; but the people in the doorway were talking about her, and their talk informed him that she was somewhere in the innermost angle of the back drawing-room, behind the grand piano, and that she was going to sing. Then there came an authoritative \" Silence, please,\" from Hawberk, followed by a sudden hush as of sentences broken off in the middle, and anon a firm hand played the symphony to Sullivan's Orpheus, and the grand mezzo soprano voice rolled out the grand Shakesperean words set to exquisite music. The choice of the song was a delicate compliment to Hawberk's"], [230, "222 THE VENETIANS. master in art, who was among Mrs. Hawberk's guests. The Venetian accent was still present in Lisa's pronunciation, but her English had improved as much as her vocalization, under Hawberk's train ing. He had taken extraordinary pains with this particular song, and every note rang out clear as crystal, pure as thrice-refined gold. Sir Arthur's \" Brava, bravissima ! \" was heard amidst the applause that followed the song. Sefton elbowed his way through the crowd \u2014 as politely as was consistent with a determination to reach a given point \u2014 and contrived to mingle with the group about the singer. She was standing by the piano in a careless attitude, dressed in a black velvet gown, which set off the yellowish whiteness of her shoulders and full round throat. Clasped round that statuesque throat, she wore a collet necklace of diamonds, splendid in size and colour, a necklace which could not have been bought for less than six or seven hundred pounds. \" So,\" thought Sefton. \" Those diamonds don't quite come into Hawberk's notion of the lady's moral character.\""], [231, "\"HE SAID, 'SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.\"' 223 Mr. Sefton did not know that, after the manner of Venetian women, Lisa looked upon jewellery as the best investment for her capital, and that almost the whole of her professional earnings since her debut were represented by the diamonds she wore round her neck. She and la Zia were able to live on so little, and it was such a pleasure to them to save, first to gloat over the golden sovereigns, and then to change them into precious stones. There was such a delightful feeling in being able to wear one's fortune round one's neck. Mr. Hawberk had accompanied the singer, and he was still sitting at the piano, when Sefton's eager face reminded him of his promise. \" Signora, allow me to introduce another of your English admirers. Mr. Sefton, a connoisseur in the way of music, and a cosmopolitan in the way of speech.\" Lisa turned smilingly to the stranger. \" You speak Italian,\" she said in her own language, and Sefton replying in very good Tuscan, they were soon on easy terms ; and presently he had the delight of taking her down to the supper room, where there was a long narrow table"], [232, "224 THE VENETIANS. loaded with delicacies, and a perpetual flow of champagne. Lisa enjoyed herself here as frankly as she had enjoyed herself at the sign of the Black Hat, in the Piazza di San Marco. She was the same unsophisticated Lisa still, in the matter of quails and lobster mayonnaise, creams and jellies. She stood at the table and eat all the good things that Sefton brought her, and drank three or four glasses of champagne with jovial unconcern, and talked of the people and the gowns they were wearing in her soft southern tongue, secure of not being understood, though Sefton warned her occasionally that there might be other people in the room besides themselves who knew the language of Dante and Boccaccio. Never had he talked to any beautiful woman who was so thoroughly unsophisticated ; and that somewhat plebeian nature had a curious charm for him. He could understand Vansittart's infatuation for such a woman, but could not understand his giving her up for the sake of Eve Marchant, whose charms as compared with Lisa's were \" As moonlight unto sunlight, or as water unto wine.\""], [233, "\"HE SAID, 'SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.'\" 225 He hoped to discover all the history of that intrigue by-and-by, seeing how freely Lisa talked of herself to an acquaintance of an hour. He meant to follow up that acquaintance with all the earnestness of which he was capable. \" There are no finer diamonds in the room than your necklace,\" he said, when she had been praising an ancient dowager's jewels, gems whose beauty was not enhanced by a neck that looked as if its bony structure had been covered with one of the family parchments. \"Do you really like them ? \" asked Lisa, with a flashing smile. \" She doesn't even blush for her spoil,\" thought Sefton. \" I'm so glad you think them good,\" continued Lisa. \" They are all my fortune. The jeweller told me I should never repent buying them.\" \" What, Signora, did you buy them ? I thought they were the offering of some devoted admirer.\" \" Do you suppose I would accept such a gift from any one except \u2014 except somebody I cared for ? \" she exclaimed indignantly. \" A man sent me a diamond bracelet one night at the VOL.

I sent it back next morning \u2014 or at least Zinco sent it back for me.\" \" And I dare say you have even forgotten the man's name ? \" said Sefton. \" Yes. Your English names are very ugly, and very difficult to remember. They are so short ; so insignificant.\" And then she told him the history of her diamonds ; how the manager of the Apollo had first doubled, and then trebled, and then quad rupled her salary ; how she had kept the money in her trunk, all in gold, sovereigns upon sovereigns, and how she and her aunt had counted the gold every week, and how only last Saturday she and la Zia had gone off in a cab to Piccadilly, with a bag full of gold, and had bought the diamonds, which were now shining on Fiordelisa's throat. \" We had less than half the price of the neck lace,\" concluded Lisa, \" but when the jeweller heard who I was, he insisted that I should take it away with me, and pay him by degrees, just as I find convenient, so I shall pay him my salary every Saturday until I am out of debt.\""], [235, "227 \"HE SAID, 'SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.'\" \"It sounds like a fairy tale,\" said Sefton. \" Do you and your aunt live upon rose leaves and dew, Signora ; or how is that you can afford to invest all your earnings in diamonds ? \" \"Oh, we have other money,\" answered Lisa, with a defiant glance at the questioner. \" I need not sing unless I like.\" \" Indeed ! \" exclaimed Sefton, strengthened in his conviction that Signora Vivanti was not alto gether so \" straight \" as Hawberk believed, or affected to believe. Mr. Sefton was not so confiding as the com poser. He was a man prone to think badly of women, and he was inclined to think the worst of this brilliant Venetian, much as he admired her. He followed her like a shadow for the rest of the evening, escorted her up the narrow stair case, and stood near the piano while she sang, and then took her from the stifling atmosphere of the lamp-lit house to the semi-darkness of the garden, which Mrs. Hawberk had converted into a tent, shutting out the wintry sky, and enclosing the miniature lawn and surrounding shrubbery ; a tent dimly lighted with fairy lamps, nestling among the foliage. Here he sat talking with"], [236, "228 THE VENETIANS. Lisa in a shadowy corner, while three or four other couples murmured and whispered in other nooks and corners, and while Hawberk, feeling he had done his duty as host, smoked and drank whisky and soda with a little group of chosen friends \u2014 an actor, a journalist, a playwright, and a brace of musical critics, who had an inex haustible flow of speech, and a delicious uncon sciousness of time. Sefton too was unconscious of time, talking with Lisa in that soft Italian tongue, having to bend his head very near the full red lips in order to catch the Venetian elisions, the gentle, sliding syllables. The hum of voices, the occasional ripples of laughter, the music and song, dwindled and died into silence \u2014 even the lights in the lower windows grew dim, and gradually Sefton awakened to the fact that the party was at an end, and that he and Signora Vivanti, and Haw berk's Bohemian group yonder, were all that remained of Mrs. Hawberk's musical evening. He bent down to look at his watch by one of the fairy lamps. Three o'clock."], [237, "\"HE SAID, 'SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.\"' 229 \" By Jove, we are sitting out everybody else,\" he said, with a pleased laugh, triumphant at the thought that he had been able to amuse and interest his companion. \" Three o'clock. Very late for a musical evening. You did not know it was so late, did you, Signora ? \" \" No,\" answered Lisa, carelessly ; \" but I don't mind. I've been enjoying myself.\" \" So have I ; but it's rather rough on Mrs. Haw berk, who may want to rest from her labours.\" \" I am quite ready to go home as soon as I get my shawl,\" said Lisa, rising from the low wicker chair, straight as a dart, her neck and shoulders and long bare arms looking like marble in the faint glimmer of the toy lamps. Sefton stood and looked at her, drinking in her loveliness as if it had been a draught of wine from an enchanted cup. Oh, the charm of those Italian eyes ; so brilliant, yet so soft ; so darkly deep ! Could there be any magic in fairyland more potent than the spell this Calypso was weaving round him ? \" May I call your carriage ? \" he asked \" I have no carriage. I live close by7.\" \" Let me see you home, then.\" She shrugged her shoulders with a gesture"], [238, "230 THE VENETIANS. which meant that the thing wasn't worth dis puting about, and Sefton followed her across the little bit of grass to the house door. Hawberk stopped her on her way. \" What, my Vivanti not gone yet ! \" he cried. \" I would have had another song out of you if I had known you were there. What have you and Mr. Sefton found to say to each other all this time ? \" \" We have found plenty to say7. He has been talking Italian, which none of you stupid others can talk. It is a treat to hear my own language from some one besides la Zia. Good night, Signor. Shall I find la Signora to wish her good night?\" \" No, child. La Signora Hawberkini retired to rest an hour ago, when all the respectable people had gone. She did not wait to see the last of such night birds as you and Sefton, and these dis reputable journalists here.\" \" I love the night,\" said Lisa, in no wise abashed. \" It is ever so much nicer than day.\" The servants had vanished, but she found her wrap lying on a sofa \u2014 an old red silk shawl, a Bellaggio shawl, whose dinginess went ill with"], [239, "\"HE SAID, 'SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.\"' 231 her velvet gown and diamond necklace ; but she wrapped it about her head and shoulders, nothing caring, and she looked a real Italian peasant as she turned to Sefton in the light of the hall lamps. He admired her even more at this moment than he had admired her before \u2014 he liked to think of her as a peasant ; with no womanly sensitiveness to suffer, no pride to be wounded ; divided from him socially by a great gulf of difference ; and so much the more surely7, and so much the more lightly to be won. They went out into the street together. It was moonlight, a February moon, cold, and sharp, and clear, with a hoar frost whitening the wintry shrubs and iron railings. Lisa caught up her velvet train, and tripped lightly along the pavement in bronze beaded slippers and bright red stockings, Sefton at her side. She would not take his arm , both hands being occupied, one clutching the silk shawl, the other holding up her skirt. The walk was of the shortest, for Saltero's Mansion was only just round the corner; nor could Sefton detain her on the doorstep for any sentimentality about the moonlit river. She had her key in the door in a moment, and as he pushed the big, heavy"], [240, "232 THE VENETIANS. door open for her, she vanished behind it with briefest \" Grazie, e buona notte, caro Signor.\" There had not been time for the gentlest pres sure of her strong, broad hand, or for his tender \" Addio, bellissima mia,\" to be heard. But to know where she lived was something gained, and as he walked homeward humming \" la donna e mobile,\" he meant to follow up that advantage. He had told her that he was her near neighbour. He had gone even further, and had asked her if she would sing for him at a little tea-party, were he to give one in her honour ; on which she had only laughed, and said that she had never heard of a man giving a tea-party. The acquaintance begun so auspiciously gave Wilfred Sefton a new zest for London life. He hailed the hardening frosts of February with absolute pleasure, he for whom that month had hitherto been the cream of the hunting season. He cared nothing that his latest acquisitions, the hunters in whose perfections he still believed, whose vices he had not had time to discover, were eating their heads off in his Sussex stables. He was in his stall at the Apollo every night ; and Lisa's singing and Lisa's beauty, and the \" quips"], [241, "\"HE SAID, 'SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.'\" 233 and cranks and wanton wiles \" which constituted Lisa's idea of acting, were enough for his con tentment. He waited till Wednesday before he ventured to call upon his divinity. He would gladly have presented himself at her door on Monday after noon ; but he did not want to appear too eager. Tuesday seemed a long blank day to his im patience, although there was plenty to do in London for a man of intellect and taste ; pictures, people, politics, all manner of interests and amusements. Lisa had told him about the aunt who lived with her and kept house for her. There could be no shadow of impropriety in his visit. He made up his mind indeed to ask for the elder lady in the first instance ; but all uncertainty was saved him, as it was la Zia who opened the door. Those diamonds of Lisa's could not have been earned so speedily had the Venetians taken upon themselves the maintenance of a servant. What was she there for, argued la Zia, when Hawberk suggested the necessity of a parlour maid, except to sweep and dust, and market and cook ? An English servant, who would want"], [242, "234 THE VENETIANS. butcher's meat every day, and would object to the cuisine a I'huile, would be an altogether ruinous institution. La Zia was not too tidy in her indoor apparel, since her love for finery was stronger than her sense of the fitness of things. She had one gown at a time, a gown of silk or plush or velveteen, which she wore as a best gown till it began to be shabby or dilapidated, when Lisa bought her another fine gown, and the old one was taken for daily use. Lisa's taste had become somewhat chastened since she had lived at Chelsea. A casual word or two from Vansittart, whose lightest speech she remembered, had made her scrupulously plain in her attire \u2014 save on such an occasion as Mrs. Hawberk's party, when her innate love of finery showed itself in scarlet stockings and beaded shoes. This afternoon Sefton found her sitting on the hearthrug in front of the bright little tiled grate, in the black stuff gown she had worn when he first saw her, and with just the same touch of colour at her throat, and in her blue black hair. She and the little boy were sitting on the rug"], [243, "\"HE SAID, 'SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.'\" 235 together, dividing the caprices of a white kitten, the plaything of mother and son, mother and son laughing gaily, with laughter which mingled and harmonized in perfect music. The boy made no change in his sprawling attitude as Sefton entered ; but he looked up at the stranger with large dark eyes, wondering, and slightly resentful. \" His boy,\" thought Sefton, and felt a malignant disposition to kick the sprawling imp, hanging on to the mother's skirts, and preventing her from rising to greet her visitor. \" Let go, Paolo,\" said Lisa, laughing. \" What with you and the kitten, I can't stir.\" She shook herself free, transferred the kitten to the boy's eager arms, rose, and gave Sefton her hand, with a careless grace which was charm ing to contemplate from an artistic point of view, but which showed him how faint an impression all their talk and intimacy of Sunday night had made upon her. A woman who had thought of him in the interval would have blushed and been startled at his coming. Lisa took his visit much too easily. There was neither surprise nor gladness in her greeting. \" I saw you in the stalls,\" she said, \" last night,"], [244, "236 THE VENETIANS. and the night before. Aren't you tired of Fanchonette ? \" \" Not in the least.\" \" You must be monstrously fond of music,\" she said, always in Italian. \" I am \u2014 monstrously ; but I have other reasons for liking Fanchonette. I like to see you act, as well as hear you sing.\" \" So do other people,\" she answered, with frank vanity, tossing up her head. \" They all applaud me when I first come on, before I have sung a note. I have to stand there in front of the lights for ever so long, while they go on applaud ing like mad. And yet people say you English have no enthusiasm, that you care very little for anything.\" \" We care a great deal for that which is really beautiful ; but most of all when it is fresh and 5, new. \" Ah ! that's what Mr. Hawberk says \u2014 I am all the better because I am not highly trained like other singers. My ignorance is my strength.\" \" But she has worked,\" interposed la Zia ; \" ah ! how hard she has worked ! At her piano ; at the English language. She has such a strong will."], [245, "\"HE SAID, 'SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.'\" 237 She has but to make up her mind, and the thing is done.\" \" One can read as much, Signora, in those flashing eyes ; in that square brow and firmly moulded chin,\" said Sefton, putting down his hat and cane, and establishing himself in one of the prettily draped basket-chairs. \"And pray how did it happen that you two ladies made up your minds to seek your fortunes in London ? \" \" It was the impresario who brought us. We were at Milan, and we came to London to sing in the chorus at Covent Garden. It was good fortune which brought us so far from home.\" \" And you hate London, no doubt, after Italy ? \" \" No, indeed, Signor. London is a city to love \u2014 the Avide, wide streets; the big, big houses; the great squares \u2014 ah ! the Piazza is nothing to your squares \u2014 and the shops, the beautiful shops ! Your sky is often gloomy, but there are summer days \u2014 heavenly days \u2014 when the wind blows down to the sea, and sweeps all the darkness out of the heavens, and your sky grows blue, like Italy. Those are days to remember.\" \" True ! They are rare enough to be counted on the fingers of one hand,\" answered Sefton,"], [246, "238 THE VENETIANS. stooping to take hold of the boy, who had been pursuing his kitten on all-fours, and had this moment plunged between Sefton's legs to extract the animated ball of white fluff from under his chair. He felt nothing but aversion for the handsome, dark-eyed brat; but he felt that he must take some notice of the creature, if he wanted to stand well with the mother. \" Che sta facendo, padroncino ? \" The boy was friendly, and explained himself in a torrent of broken speech. The cat was a bad cat, and wouldn't stay with him. Would the Signor make him stay ? Sefton had to stoop and risk a scratching from the tiny claws, in a vain endeavour to get hold of the rebellious beast, which rolled away from him, hissing and spitting, and finally rushed across the room and took refuge behind the piano. Sefton lifted the boy on to his knee, and produced his watch, that unfailing object of interest to infancy, usually denominated, on the principle of all slang nomen clature, \"tick-tick.\" Once interested in the opening and shutting of the \"tick-tick,\" Paolo sat on the visitor's knee, comme un image, and allowed Sefton to talk to Lisa and her aunt."], [247, "\" HE SAID, ' SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.' \" 239 He was careful to make himself agreeable to the elder lady, who was charmed to find an Englishman who understood her native tongue. She had contrived to learn a little English, but had made no such progress as her niece, and it was a labour to her to talk. What a pleasure, therefore, to find this suave, handsome English man, with his courtly manners, quick compre hension, and ready replies. From la Zia he heard a good deal about Lisa's early life ; yet there was a certain wise reticence even on that loquacious lady's part. She breathed no word of Lisa's Englishman, the first Mr. Smith, or of the second. In all her talk of their old life, in Venice, at Milan, there was no hint of any one but themselves. They appeared to have been alone, unprotected, dependent on their own small earnings. After waiting in vain for any allusion to Van sittart, Mr. Sefton came straight to the point, with a direct question. \" I think you know a friend of mine, Signora,\" he said to Lisa. \" Mr. Vansittart ? \" \" Vansittart ? \" Lisa repeated the name slowly, with a look of blank wonder."], [248, "240 THE VENETIANS. \" Have you never heard that name before ? \" \" Never.\" \" So,\" thought Sefton, \" she knew him under an alias. That means a good deal, and confirms my original idea.\" He put the boy off his knee almost roughly, and rose to take his leave. \"Good-bye, Signora. You will let me drop in again some day, I hope ? \" \"If you like. Why did you think I knew your friend, Mr. Van \u2014 sit \u2014 tart ? \" \"Because last spring I saw you in Cheyne Walk talking to a man whom I took for Van sittart. A tall man, with fair hair. You seemed very friendly with him ; your hands were clasped upon his arm ; you were smiling up at him.\" This time Lisa blushed a deep carnation, and her face saddened. \" Oh, that,\" she stammered \u2014 \" that was some one I knew in Italy.\" \" Not Vansittart ? \" \"No.\" \"But the gentleman has a name of some kind,\" persisted Sefton. \"Never mind his name,\" she answered"], [249, "\"HE SAID, 'SHE HAS A LOVELY FACE.'\" 241 abruptly. \" I don't want to talk about him. I may never see him again, perhaps.\" And then, brushing away a tear, and becoming suddenly frivolous, she asked, \" How did you come to remember me \u2014 after so long ? \" \" Because that moment by the river yonder has lived in my memory ever since \u2014 because no man can forget the loveliest face he ever saw in his life.\" With that compliment, and with a lingering clasp of the strong hand, he concluded his first visit to Saltero's Mansion, la Zia accompanying him to the door and curtsying him out. VOL. II. p."], [250, "242 THE VENETIANS. CHAPTER X. peggy's chance. If there were blue skies now and then in a London February, what was February along the Riviera, but the most exquisite spring-time? And perhaps on all that favoured shore, Cannes has the richest firstfruits of the fertile year, for it is then that the mimosas are in their glory, and the hill of Californie is a kind of yellow fairy land, an enchanted region, where all the trees drop golden rain. Eve and her lover husband were at Cannes. Delicious as the place was at this season, and new as the shores of the Mediterranean were to Eve, she and her husband had not come there for their own pleasure. They had come at the advice of the doctors \u2014 to give Peggy a chance. That was what it had come to. Peggy's only"], [251, "PEGGY'S CHANCE 243 chance of living through the winter was\" to be found in the south. One doctor had suggested Capri, another Sorrento ; but for some unex plained reason Vansittart objected to Italy, and then Mentone or Cannes had been talked about ; and finally Cannes was decided upon, for medical reasons, in order that Peggy might have the watchful care of Dr. Bright, which might give her an additional chance in the hand-to hand struggle with her grim adversary. Vansittart had offered, in the first instance, to send Peggy to the south in the care of one of her elder sisters and an experienced travelling maid, to be chosen especially for the invalid's comfort ; but Eve had been so distressed at the idea of parting with the ailing child, so fearful lest she should not be properly nursed, or lest she should droop and die of home-sickness, that of his own accord he had offered to accompany this youngest sister-in-law on the journey, that was to give her a chance \u2014 alas ! only a chance. None of the doctors talked of cure as a certainty. Peggy's family history was bad ; and Peggy's lungs were seriously affected. It was almost inevitable that the youngest"], [252, "244 THE VENETIANS. child \u2014 born after the mother's health had begun to fail \u2014 should inherit the mother's fatal tendency to lung disease; but things were altogether different in the case of Eve, the eldest daughter, born before her mother had begun to develop lung trouble. For Eve there was every chance. This was what a distinguished specialist told Vansittart, when he asked piteously if the hereditary disease shown too clearly by Peggy, were likely to appear by-and-by in Eve's consti tution. He was obliged to take what comfort he could from this assurance. He would not alarm Eve by suggesting that her chest should be sounded by the physician who had just passed sentence upon her sister. Perhaps he did not want to learn too much. He was content to see his young wife fair and blooming, with all the indications of perfect health, and to believe that she must needs be exempt from inherited evil. She was enraptured when he offered to take her to the south with Peggy. \"You are more than good, you are adorable,\" she cried. \" Now I feel justified in having worshipped you. What, you will leave Hamp shire just when the hunting is at its best? You"], [253, "PEGGY'S CHANCE. 245 will forego all your plans for the spring ? And you will put up with a sick child's company ? \" \" I shall have my wife's company, and that is enough. I shall see you happy and at ease, and not wearing yourself to death with anxieties and apprehensions about Peggy.\" \" Yes, I shall be ever so much happier with her, should things come to the worst \" \u2014 her eyes brimmed over with sudden tears at the thought\u2014 \" it will be so much to be with her \u2014 to know that we have made her quite happy.\" They went to Haslemere next morning, and there was a grand scene with Peggy, who screamed with rapture on hearing that Eve and Jack were going to take her to Cannes their very own selves. She, who fancied she had lost Eve for ever, was to live with her, to sleep in the next room to her, to see her every day and all day long. Then came the journey \u2014 the long, long journey, which made Eve and Peggy open wondering eyes at the width of France from sea to sea. They travelled with all those luxuries which modern civilization provides for the traveller who is willing to pay for them. And"], [254, "246 THE VENETIANS. every detail of the journey was a new surprise and a new joy for Peggy, who brought upon her self more than one bad fit of coughing by her absolute ecstasy. The luncheon and dinner on board the rushing Bapide; the comfortable wagon-lit to retire to at Lyons, when darkness had fallen over the eternal monotony of the landscape \u2014 and anon the surprise of awaking at midnight in a large bright room where two small beds were veiled like brides in white net curtains, and where a delightful wood fire blazed on a wide open hearth, such as Peggy only knew of in fairy tales. How comforting was the basin of hot soup which Peggy sipped, squatting beside this cavernous chimney, while Benson, the courier maid, skilled in nursing invalids, who had been engaged chiefly to wait upon Peggy, unpacked the Gladstone bag, and made everything com fortable for the night. Peggy had slept fitfully all the way from Lyons, hearing as in a dream the porters shouting \" Avignon,\" at a place where they stopped in the winter darkness, and faintly remembering having heard of a city where Popes lived and tortured people once upon a time."], [255, "PEGGY'S CHANCE. 247 She woke now and again in her white-curtained bed at Marseilles ; for however happy her days might be her nights were generally restless and troubled. The new maid was very attentive to her, and gave her lemonade when her throat was parched, but the maid was able to sleep soundly between whiles, when Peggy was lying awake gazing through the white net curtains, and half expecting Robin Goodfellow to come creeping out of the wide black chimney, where the last red glow had faded from the heap of pale grey ashes on the hearth. Towards morning Peggy fell into a refreshing slumber, and when she opened her eyes again the room was full of sunshine, and there was a band playing the \" Faust Waltz \" in the public gardens below. \" Why, it's summer ! \" cried Peggy, clapping her hands, and leaping out of the parted white curtains, and rushing to the open window. The maid was dressed, and Peggy's breakfast was ready for her. \" Oh, such delicious coffee ! \" she told Eve afterwards, \" in a sweet little copper pot, and rolls such as were never made in hum drum England.\""], [256, "248 THE VENETIANS. Yes, it was summer, the February summer of that lovely shore. The Vansittarts stayed nearly a week at Marseilles, to rest Peggy after her forty-eight hours' journey ; and to see the Votive Church on the hill, and that famous dungeon on the rock which owes more of its renown to fiction than to fact ; and the parting of the ways where the ships sail east and west, to Orient or Afric, the two wonder-worlds for the untravelled European. Eve and Peggy looked longingly at the great steamers vanishing on the horizon, hardly knowing whether, if the choice were put to them, they would go right or left \u2014 to the country where the Great Moguls, the jewelled temples, the tiger hunts, the palanquins, the tame elephants with castles on their backs are to be found ; or to the country where the Moors live, and where modern civilization camps gipsy fashion among the vestiges of earth's most ancient people. \" Where would you like to go best, India or Africa ? \" asked Eve, as she and Peggy sat side by side in a fairy-like yawl, that went dipping and dancing over those summer waves, and seemed like a toy boat as it sailed"], [257, "PEGGY'S CHANCE. 249 under the lee of an Orient steamer bound for Alexandria. \" Oh, I think I would rather go up a pyramid than anything,\" gasped Peggy, breathless at the mere thought. \" Don't you remember ' Belzoni's Travels,' that tattered little old book which once was mother's, and how they used to grope about, Belzoni and his people, and lose them selves in dark passages, and make discoveries inside the Pyramids ? And then the Nile, and the crocodiles, which one could always run away from, because they can't turn, don't you know ? Oh, I think Egypt must be best of all.\" Peggy and her companions were out driving along the Corniche road or sailing over the blue waters every day, and all day long; and the invalid made a most wonderful recovery during that week. Her nights were ever so much quieter, her appetite had improved. Peggy's chance began to look like a certainty, and hope revived in Eve's breast. Hope had never died there. She could not believe that this bright, happy young creature was to be taken away from her. There was such vitality in Peggy, such vigour in those"], [258, "250 THE VENETIANS. thin arms when they clasped themselves round Eve's neck, such light and life in the full blue eyes when they looked out upon the movement and variety of the Rue Cannabiere, or the bustle of the quays. They went on to Cannes, and alighted first at one of the most comfortable hotels in Europe, the Mont Fleuri, so as to take their time in the selection of a home ; for they meant to stay in Provence till there was an end of cold weather in England, to go back only when an English spring should have done its worst, and the foot steps of summer should be at hand. If Cannes should grow too warm, there was Grasse ; and there were cool retreats perched still higher on the mountain slopes, where they might spend the last month or so of their sojourn. There were reasons why Eve would be glad to escape from the little world in which she was known, reasons why she should prefer the absolute re tirement of a villa in a strange land, where she need receive no more visitors than she chose, where she might let it be known among the little community of British residents that she did not desire to be called upon."], [259, "PEGGY'S CHANCE. 251 They found just the retreat that suited them, high on the fair hill, which at this season was cloaked with the mimosa's golden bloom as with a royal garment. The villa stood on higher ground than the Hotel Californie, and all the gulf of San Juan lay at its feet, and the ships at anchor looked like toy ships in the distance of that steep descent, where palm and pine, cypress and olive, lent their varying form and colour to the rough grey rocks, and where garden below garden spread a carpet of vivid flowers, hedges of roses, beds of pale pink and deep purple ane mones, the scarlet and orange of the ranunculus, amidst the gloom of rocky gorge and pine forest. Beyond the gulf rose the islands, shadowy at eventide, clear and sunlit in those early mornings when Peggy watched the red fires of dawn light ing up far away yonder towards Italy. She shared Eve's vivid imaginings about that neigh bouring country, and thought with wonder of being so near the border of that mystical land. All her ideas of Italy were derived from \" Childe Harold,\" the more famous passages of which she had read and learnt diligently under Eve's in struction, the eldest daughter carrying on the"], [260, "252 THE VENETIANS. education of the youngest in a casual way, after the homely governess had vanished from the scene. The villa was a small house, flung down care lessly, as it seemed, in a spacious garden, a garden which had been neglected of late years, since much smarter villas had risen up, white and ornamental, upon the heights of Californie. But the garden had once been cared for. It was full of roses and ivy-leaved geranium, anemones and narcissi, and, what pleased Peggy most of all, there was a grove of orange trees, where she could lie upon the grass and let the mandarin oranges drop into her lap. Eve and her young sister sat in this orange orchard for hours at a stretch, Eve working at one of those tiny garments which it was her delight to make \u2014 \" dressing dolls,\" Van sittart called it ; Peggy pretending to read, but for the most part gazing at sky or sea, watching the white clouds or the white ships sailing by in the blue. \" Don't you think heaven must be very like this ? \" Peggy asked, one sunshiny noontide, when the sky was of its deepest sapphire, and the balmy air had the warmth and perfume of an English midsummer."], [261, "253 PEGGY'S CHANCE. \" What, Peg, do you suppose there are orange trees in the ' Land of the Leal ' \u2014 orange trees, and smart villas, and afternoon parties ? \" \" No, no\u2014 only the blue sky, and the sea, and the hills jutting out, one beyond another, till they melt into the sky. It looks as if one could never come to the end of it all. It looks just like heaven.\" \"Endless, and without limits, like Eternity,\" said Vansittart, smiling at her, unconscious that Eve's head was bent lower and lower over her work to hide the streaming tears. \" A pretty fancy. But that boundless-seeming sea is only a big round pool after all ; and think how clever it was of Columbus to find his way out of that mill-pond, and across the great ocean, and what triumph for Cortez to discover a second ocean, bigger than the first. And yet this earth of ours is only a round ball, a speck in the infinite.\" \" Don't,\" cried Peggy, with her fingers in her ears. \" You make my head ache. I can't bear to think of the universe ; it's too big. Miitterchen used to tell me about it when I was a small child. She made me dream bad dreams.

That's what the Bible means, doesn't it ? I can't bear to think of anything more than that.\" \" Don't think, darling,\" said Eve, sitting down on the grass beside her, and drawing the fragile form close against her own \u2014 \" don't think. Only be happy. Breathe this delicious air, bask in this delightful sun, be happy, and get well.\" \" Oh, I am getting well as fast as ever I can. Except for my tiresome cough, I am as well as anybody can be. I wonder what they are doing at Fernhurst. Skating on Farmer Green's pond, perhaps, or crouching over the fire. Yrou know how Hetty would always sit with her head hang ing over the coals, in spite of all you could say about spoiling her complexion. And here we spoil our complexions in the sun. Isn't it wonderful ? \" \" Everything in our lives is wonderful, Peggy. Most of all, that I should have such a husband as Jack.\" Eve held out her hand to that model husband,"], [263, "255 PEGGY'S CHANCE. smiling at him, with eyes that were veiled in tears, more grateful for his goodness to this ailing child than for all the love that he had lavished upon herself. What a happy season this would have been in the lovely land beside the tideless sea, if hope had never been dashed with fear. But, alas ! there were moments, even at Peggy's best, when the shadow of earthly doom fell dark across the summer glory of a clime that knows not winter. Sometimes, in the midst of her joyous delight in the things around her, a sudden paroxysm of coughing would surprise the poor child, shaking and rending her as if some invisible demon had seized the wasted form by the narrow shoulders, and were trying to tear it piecemeal. \" My enemy has been very cruel to me to-day,\" Peggy would say afterwards, with a serio-comic smile. \"I thought Dr. Bright would get the better of him.\" At first she used to call that wearing cough her enemy, as she had heard old people talk of their gout or their rheumatism. Later, she talked of her cough as the dragon, and of Dr. Bright as St. George ; but although the medical champion"], [264, "256 THE VENETIANS. might get the better of the dragon now and again, he was a sturdy monster, and harder to kill than the toughest crocodile along the sandy shores of old Nile. Peggy was wonderfully patient, wonder fully hopeful about herself, even when hope began to wax faint and dim in the hearts of her com panions, when the trained attendant could tell of sleepless and sorely-troubled nights, and when Eve, creeping in from her adjoining bedchamber half a dozen times between night and morning, was saddened at finding the fevered head tossing unquietly upon the heaped-up pillows, the blue eyes wide open, and the parched lips uttering speech that told of semi-delirium. However bad Peggie's nights were, her days were generally cheerful. She was never tired of the hillside walks, the luxury of ferns, and palms, and aloes, the glory of the golden-tufted mimosas, the peach blossom, the anemones, the silvery threads of water creeping down the rocky gorges, such narrow streamlets, cleaving Titanic rocks. To Peggy these things brought no satiety; while the more earthly and sensual enjoyment of afternoon tea at Rumpelmeyer's, sitting out of doors, and eating as many cakes"], [265, "257 PEGGY'S CHANCE. and bon-bons as ever she liked, was only a lesser revelation of a world where all was beauty. Eve and her husband saw the crowds at Rumpel meyer's with an amused interest. They looked on at this curiously blended smart world, this olla-podrida of Royal Duchesses and Liverpool merchants, millionaires and impecunious cavaliere servente, Parisian celebrities, the old nobility of France and England \u2014 old as the Angevin kings, when England and France were one monarchy \u2014 and the newly gotten wealth of New York and Chicago. Eve and Vansittart looked on and were amused, and then drove back to the villa. on the hill, and rejoiced in the seclusion of their own garden, which it had been their delight to improve and beautify. Everything grew so quickly \u2014 the rose-trees they planted throve so wellthat it was like gardening in fairyland. They were not intruded upon by that smart world which they saw at the tea-shop on the Croisette. At Cannes two things only count as worthy of regard or reverence \u2014 the first, fashion ; the second, money. Eve and her husband had neither one nor the other. A Hampshire squire, with three thousand a year and a young wife, vol. n. s"], [266, "258 THE VENETIANS. was a person who could interest nobody. Had he been a bachelor and a dancing man, he would have been eligible and even courted ; for dancing men are in a minority, and a ball at the Cercle Nautique is apt to recall Edwin Long's famous picture of the Babylonian Marriage Market, women of all nationalities waiting to be asked to dance. A married man, a Hampshire squire, living quietly with his wife and her sister in one of the cheapest villas in Californie was a person to seek, and not to be sough t. If the Vansittarts wanted to be in society they should have brought letters of introduction, observed a Plutocrat whose garden joined the Vansittarts' modest enclosure. \" We can't be expected to take any interest in people of whom we know absolutely nothing.\" It would have been difficult, if not impossible, for the leaders of Cannes society, the owners of palatial villas, and givers of luncheons and dances, to believe or understand that these pariahs did not desire to enter within the charmed circle where wealth was the chief qualification, and where the triple millionaire, however humble his origin, and however dubious the source of"], [267, "PEGGY'S CHANCE. 259 his gold, was sure of admission and approval. Granted that such millionaires were talked of lightly as \" good fun.\" The smart people who laughed were pleased to eat their luncheons, and dance at their balls, or drive on their coaches, or sail in their yachts. For the smart world of Californie and La Route de Frejus February meant a continual round of luncheons and teas, dinners and dances. Everybody complained of the \" strain,\" of being \" dragged \" from party to party, of having \" so much to do ; \" these butter flies treating the futilities of life as if they were serious labour. To these the tranquil happiness of such a couple as Eve and Vansittart was un thinkable. Of course the poor things would be in society if society would have them. Cannes must be very dreary for such as they. It was really a pity that this kind of people did not stop short at St. Raphael or go on to Alassio.

What less in loveliness than heaven could be a land where one could picnic in February ? For Peggy's sake there were many picnics \u2014 now in a rocky gorge on the road to Vallauris, where one could sit about the dry bed of a cataract, and set out one's luncheon on great rocky boulders, screened by feathery palm trees that suggested the South Sea Islands ; now on the hilltop at Mougins, with the great white hotel, and the pinnacled walls of Grasse looking at them, across the deep valley of flower fields and mulberry orchards, blossoming lilies and budding vines ; and now, with even more delight, in some sheltered inlet on the level shore of St. Honorat, some tiny cove where the water was clear and exquisite in colour ing as ever dreamer imagined that jasper sea of the Apocalypse. Sometimes they landed and took their picnic luncheon under the pine trees, or on the edge of the sea \u2014 Peggy keenly interested in everything she saw, the time-worn fortress monastery that rose tall above the level shore, and the modern building with its low-roofed cells and modest chapel, a building whose monastic"], [269, "PEGGY'S CHANCE. 261 rule forbade the entrance of Peggy and all her sex, and which therefore inspired the liveliest curiosity on her part. Not less delightful was the sister island of St. Marguerite, with its thrilling mystery of the nameless prisoner, whom Peggy would have to be none other than a twin brother of the great Louis, and whose faded red velvet chair she looked at with affection and awe. \" To think of his meekly worshipping in this chapel, with an iron mask upon his face, when he might have been reigning over France and making war all over Europe, like the great King.\" \" But in that case Louis must have been here. You wouldn't have a brace of monarchs, Peggy. One brother must have gone to the wall,\" argued Vansittart. \" They needn't have shut him up in a dungeon, and made him wear a mask,\" said Peggy. \" True, Peggy ; the whole story involves a want of common sense which makes it incredible. I no more believe in a twin brother of Louis Quatorze than in a twin brother of our Prince of Wales, languishing in the Tower of London at this present moment.\""], [270, "262 THE VENETIANS \" But you believe there was a masked prisoner,\" exclaimed Peggy, with keen anxiety. \" Oh, yes, I am willing to believe in the Italian exile. The record of that gentleman's existence seems tolerably reliable, and a very bad time he had of it. They managed things wonderfully well in those days. A political agitator, or the writer of an unpleasant epigram, could be promptly suppressed. They had prison walls for inconvenient people of all kinds.\" Peggy sighed. She did not care about the Italian politician. She had read her Dumas, and had a settled belief in the royal twin. She liked to think that he had lived and suffered in that cold grey fortress. She cared nothing for Marshal Bazaine, and his legendary leap from the parapet, which the soldier guide recited with his tongue in his cheek. She despised Vansittart for being so curious about an event which was utterly without romance \u2014 an elderly general creeping out of captivity under the nose of guardians who were wilfully blind, and going comfortably away in a steamer. Those tranquil days on the islands or on the sea would have been as exquisite for Eve as for"], [271, "PEGGY'S CHANCE. 263 Peggy if the heart of the elder sister had not been heavy with anxiety about the younger. During the first few weeks in that soft climate Peggy's chance had seemed almost a certainty of cure. Even Dr. Bright had been hopeful for those first weeks, surprised into hopefulness by the marked improvement in his patient; but of late he had been grave to despondency, and every consultation strengthened Eve's fears. Indeed, there was little need of medical science to reveal the cruel truth. Every week that went by left something of Peggy's youth and strength behind it. The walks which were easy for her in February were difficult in March, and impos sible in April. The ground that was lost was never regained. Eve looked back, and remem bered how Peggy had walked to the Signal with her a fortnight after their arrival. They had walked very slowly, and they had sat down to rest several times in the course of the journey ; but the ascent had been accomplished without pain, and Peggy had been wild with delight at the prospect which rewarded them at the top. \" We'll come up here often, won't we, Eve ? \" \" As often as you like, darling.\""], [272, "264 THE VENETIANS. The second ascent was made in March, when the peach trees and anemones were all in bloom, and the gold of the mimosas was a glory of the past. This time Peggy found the winding walks long and wearisome, and although, in spite of Eve's entreaties, she persisted in reaching the summit, the journey had evidently been too much for her. She sank exhausted on a bench, and it was nearly an hour before she was rested enough to mount the little platform on which the tele- scope stood, and explore the distance, looking for the French squadron which was rounding the point of the Esterelles, on its way to Toulon. Poor little Peggy ! She was the only person who did not believe in the seriousness of her case. \" You and Dr. Bright make too much fuss about me,\" she said to Eve, seeing tears in the fond sister's eyes. \" I am only growing. See how short my frock is ! I have grown inches since Christmas.\" She stretched out her thin legs \u2014 so thin as to make the feet look abnormally big, and con templated the spectacle with a satisfied air. \"I am going to be very tall,\" she said. \"I have only outgrown my strength. That is all"], [273, "265 PEGGY'S CHANCE. that is the matter with me. Sophy and Jenny always said as much. And as for the cough which seems to frighten you so, it's only a stomach cough. Sophy said so.\" Vansittart had procured every contrivance which could make Peggy's life easier. He bought her a donkey, on whose back she could be carried up to the Signal, and when her own back grew too weak to endure the fatigue of sitting on the donkey he bought her a wheel chair, which a patient Provencal two-legged beast of burden was willing to drag about all day, if Peggy pleased. And at each stage of her weakness \u2014 at each step on the downward road \u2014 he found some contrivance to make locomotion easier, so that Peggy might live out of doors, in the sunshine and on the sea. Alas ! there came a day when Peggy no longer cared to be carried about, when even the ripen ing loveliness of the land, the warmth and splendour of the southern spring, the white-sailed skiff with its quaint old sailors talking their unintelligible Cannois, and chivalrously attentive to Peggy's lightest wish \u2014 the time came when even these things could not tempt her from the"], [274, "266 THE VENETIANS. invalid couch in the garden, where she lay and watched the opening orange blossoms, and won dered who would be there to mark the first change from green to gold in the turn of the year, or thought of Eve's wedding and the orange wreath in her hair, and marvelled to remember how strong her young limbs felt in that gladdest of midsummers, and how slight a thing it had been to walk to the Roman village upon Bexley Hill, or to the pine-crowned crest of Blackdowu. And now Vansittart had to carry her to the sofa in the orange grove, and she lay there supine all through the golden afternoon, while Eve, who was said to be herself in delicate health, sat in a low chair near her, and read aloud from Dumas' historical novels, or some fairy tale. But this increasing weakness of hers was of no consequence, Peggy protested, when she saw Eve looking anxious about her. She had only out grown her strength. When she had done grow ing she would be as strong as ever, and able to climb those Sussex hills just as well as ever. But she would not be here to see the flower change to the fruit. That miracle of Nature's handicraft would be for other eyes \u2014 for the eyes of some"], [275, "267 PEGGY'S CHANCE. other weakling, perhaps, passing, like Peggy, through the ordeal of overgrowth. But there was something far more wonderful than tree or flower, which had been whispered about by Peggy's nurse. There was the hope of a baby nephew or a baby niece in the first month of summer, a baby that was to open its eyes on some cool Alpine valley, to which Mr. and Mrs. Vansittart and their charge would migrate, when the plane trees by the harbour had unfolded their broad leaves, and the sun that looked upon Cannes was too fierce for any but the hardy natives of the old fishing village. In that sweet summer time a baby was to appear among them, and take its place in all their hearts and on all their knees, and was to reign over them by the divine right of the firstborn. Peggy's nurse told her that, were it only for the sake of this new-comer, she ought to take care of herself, and get well quickly. \" You wouldn't like not to see the baby, would you, Miss Margaret ? \" Peggy always felt inclined to laugh when her prim attendant called her Miss Margaret. She had never been addressed by her baptismal name"], [276, "268 THE VENETIANS. by any one else; but Benson was a superior person, who had lived only in the best families, and who did everything in a superior way. \" Like not to see Eve's baby ? Why, of course I shall see it \u2014 see it and nurse it, every day of my life,\" answered Peggy. \" Of course, miss, if you are well enough when June comes.\" \"If \u2014 I \u2014 am \u2014 well \u2014 enough,\" Peggy repeated slowly, turning towards the nurse with an earnest gaze. \"Perhaps you mean that I may not live till June. I heard you say something about me to the housemaid yesterday morning when she was making your bed. I was only half asleep; though I was too drowsy to speak and let you know I could hear all you were saying. You are quite wrong \u2014 both of you. I have only out grown my strength. I shall grow up into a strong young woman, and I shall be very fond of Eve's baby. I shall be the first aunt he will know.\" She stopped to laugh \u2014 a hoarse little laugh, which it pained Benson to hear. \" Isn't that absurd ? \" she asked. \" I am calling the baby ' he.' But I do hope it will be a boy \u2014"], [277, "PEGGY'S CHANCE. 269 I adore little boys \u2014 and I'm afraid I rather hate little girls.\" \"A son and heir,\" said the nurse, placidly. \" That will look nice in the newspapers.\" \" Yes, baby will have to be in the newspapers,\" agreed Peggy. \"His first appearance upon any stage. I should so love to make something for him to wear. Eve is always working for him ; tliough she contrives to keep her work a secret, even from me. ' Mothers'-meeting work,' she said, when I asked her what she was so busy about. As if I didn't know better than that ! One doesn't use the finest lawn and real Valen ciennes for mothers'-meeting work. Let me make something for Eve's baby, Benson, there's a dear. I would take such pains with my stitches.\" \" It would tire you too much, Miss Margaret.\" \" No, no, it won't. My legs are weak \u2014 not my fingers. Let me make something, and surprise Eve with it when it is finished.\" \" I don't think Mrs. Vansittart would like you to know, miss. It is a secret.\" \" Yes, but Eve knows that I know. I told her that I had been dreaming about her, and that I"], [278, "270 THE VENETIANS. dreamt there was a baby. It was after I heard you and Paulette whispering \u2014 I really did dream \u2014 and Eve kissed me, and cried a little, and said perhaps my dream might come true.\" Peggy being very urgent, her nurse brought her some fine flannel, as soft as silk, and cut out a flannel shawl for the unknown, and instructed Peggy as to the manner in which it was to be made, and Peggy was propped up with pillows, and began a floss-silk scallop with neat little stitches, and with an earnest laboriousness which was a touching spectacle ; but, alas ! after ten minutes of strenuous labour, great beads of perspiration began to roll down Peggy's flushed face, and the thin arm and hand trembled with the effort. \" Oh, Miss Margaret, you mustn't work any more,\" cried Benson, shocked at her appear ance. \" I'm afraid I can't, Nurse ; not any more to-day,\" sighed Peggy, sinking back into the pillows, breathless and exhausted. \" But I'll go on with baby's shawl to-morrow. Please fold it up for me and keep it in your basket. Eve"], [279, "PEGGY'S CHANCE. 271 mustn't see it till it's finished. The stitches are not too long, are they ? \" No, the stitches were very small, but crowded one upon another in a manner that indicated resolute effort and failing sight. \" I feel as if I had been making shawls all day, like the poor woman in the poem,\" said Peggy. \" ' Stitch, stitch, stitch, with eyelids heavy and dim ! ' How odd it is that everything seems difficult when one is ilf! I thought it was only my legs that were weak, but I'm afraid it's the whole of me. My finger aches with the weight of my thimble \u2014 the dear little gold thimble my brother-in-law gave me on Christmas Day.\" She put the little thimble to her lips, and kissed it as if it were a sentient thing. Van sittart came into the room while she was so engaged. \"Oh, there you are,\" she said. \"Do you know what I was thinking about ? \" \" Not I, quotha,\" said he, sitting down by Peggy's couch and taking her thin little hand in his. \" Who can presume to thread the laby rinth of a young lady's mind, without the least"], [280, "272 THE VENETIANS. little bit of a clue ? You must give me a clue, Peg, if you want me to guess.\" \" Well, then, I was thinking of you. Is that a clue ? \" \" Not much of a one, my pet.

My gold thimble ; your bringing us here when you would rather have stayed in Hampshire to hunt. And I was thinking how different our lives would have been if you had never come to Fernhurst. Eve would just have gone on slaving to make both ends meet, cutting out all our frocks, and working her Wilcox and Gibbs, and bearing with father's temper, and going without things. I should have outgrown my strength all the same ; but there would have been no one to bring us to Cannes. I should never have seen the Mediterranean, or the Suow Alps, or mother's grave. I should never have"], [281, "273 PEGGY'S CHANCE. seen Eve in pretty tea-gowns, with nothing in the world to do except sit about and look lovely. You have changed our lives.\" \" For better, Peggy ? \" he asked earnestly. \" Yes, yes ; for worlds and worlds better,\" she answered, with her arms round his neck. Benson had crept off to her dinner; Peggy and her brother-in-law were alone. \" God bless you for that assurance, Peggy dear. And \u2014 if \u2014 if I were not by any means a perfect Christian \u2014 if I had done wicked things in my life \u2014 given way to a wicked temper, and done some great wrong, not in treachery but in passion, to a fellow-man \u2014 could you love me all the same, Peggy ? \" \" Of course I could.

If you were ever so wicked I think I should love you all the same.\" That was Vansittart's last serious talk with Peggy. It was indeed Peggy's last serious talk upon this planet, save for the murmured con versation in the dawn of an April day, when the London vicar, who was doing duty at St. George's, came in before an early celebration to sit beside Peggy's pillow and speak words of comfort and promise, words that told of a fairer world, whither Peggy's footsteps were being guided by an im palpable Hand \u2014 a world where it might be she would see the faces of the loved and lost \u2014 -those angel faces, missed here, to be regained there. \" Do you really believe it, sir ? \" Peggy asked eagerly, with her thin hand on the grave Church man's sleeve, her imploring looks perusing the worn, elderly face. \" Shall I really see my mother again \u2014 see her and know her in heaven ? \" \" We know only what He has told us, my dear. ' In My Father's house there are many mansions ' \u2014 and it may be that the homes we have lost \u2014 the firesides we remember dimly \u2014 the faces that"], [283, "PEGGY'S CHANCE. 275 looked upon our cradles \u2014 will be found \u2014 again \u2014 somewhere.\" \"Ah, you are crying,\" said Peggy. \"You would like to believe \u2014 just as I would. That is the only heaven I care for \u2014 to be with mother \u2014 and for Eve and Jack to come to us by-and-by.\" This day, when the vicar came in the early morning, was thought to be Peggy's last on earth, but she lingered, rallied, and slowly sank again, a gradual fading \u2014 painless towards the end ; for the stages of suffering which she had borne so patiently were past, and the last hours were peaceful. She could keep her arms round Eve's neck and listen to the soothing voice of sorrowing love, till even this effort was too much, and the weak arms 'relaxed their hold, and were gently laid upon the bed in that meek attitude which looked like the final 'repose. She could hear Eve still \u2014 speaking or reading to her in the soft, low voice that was like falling waters \u2014 but her mind was wandering in a pleasant dream land, and she thought she was drifting on a streamlet that winds through the valley between"], [284, "276 THE VENETIANS. Bexley Hill and Blackdown ; through summer pastures where the meadow-sweet grew tall and white beside the water, and where the voices of haymakers were calling to each other across the newly cut grass. \" I should like to have lived to see your child,\" were Peggy's last words, faltered brokenly into Eve's ear as she knelt beside the bed. There were long hours of silence ; the mute faint struggles of the departing spirit ; but that wish was the last of Peggy's earthly speech. Eve was broken-hearted. She never knew till the end came how she had clung to some frail thread of hope ; in spite of the Destroyer's pal pable advance ; in spite of the physician's sad certainty ; in spite of her husband's gentle warn ings, striving to prepare her for the end. The blow was terrible. Vansittart trembled for life and reason when he saw the intensity of her grief. Always highly strung, she was in a con dition of health which made hysteria more to be dreaded. The brief delay between death and burial horrified her ; yet to Vansittart that swift departure of the lifeless clay seemed an un-"], [285, "277 PEGGY'S CHANCE. utterable relief. For just a few hours the wasted form lay on the rose-strewn bed ; and then in the early dimness, before the mists had floated up from the valley, before harbour and parish church stood out clear and bright in the face of the morning sun, came the bearers of the coffin, and at nine o'clock Vansittart went alone to see the loved youngest sister laid in the cemetery on the hill, in the secluded corner he himself had chosen \u2014 near the mother's grave \u2014 as a spot where Eve might like to sit by-and-by, when sorrow should be less poignant, a nook from which she could see the shallow bay, and the cloud-capped islands jutting out into the sea, and the tall white lighthouse of Antibes, standing up above the crest of the hill, glorified in the after noon sun, as if it were nearer heaven than earth. In everything that Vansittart did at this time his thought was of Eve and her feelings. His grief for her sorrow was no less keen than the sorrow itself. He had been very fond of poor little Peggy, and had grown fonder of her as her weakness increased, and strengthened her claim upon his compassion. But now he saw with Eve's eyes, thought with Eve's mind, and every"], [286, "278 THE VENETIANS. sigh and every tear of hers wrung his heart afresh. Those earnest words of Peggy's, spoken with the wasted arms about his neck, were very precious to him. It seemed as if they were in some wise his absolution for the wrong which he had done in keeping the secret of Harold Mar chant's death. Peggy had told him that she and her sister owed comfort and happiness to him\u2014 that he had changed the tenor of their lives from struggling penury to luxury and ease. He knew that over and above all these material advantages he had given Harold Marchant's sister a profound and steadfast love \u2014 a love which would last as long as his life, and which was and would be the governing principle of his life \u2014 and he told himself that in keeping that dark secret he had done well. Tranquillized by this assurance he put aside the old fear as something to be forgotten. But there was a nearer fear, a fear which had grown out of Peggy's illness and death, which no casuistry could lessen or thrust aside. The fear of here ditary phthisis came upon him in the dead of night, and flung its dark shadow across his path"], [287, "PEGGY'S CHANCE. 279 by day. He had talked long with Dr. Bright after Peggy's death, and the kind physician had calmly discussed the probabilities of evil ; had held nothing back. Fear there must needs be, in such a case ; but there was also ground for hope. Vansittart told the doctor of Eve's buoyant spirits and energy, her long walks and untiring pleasure in natural scenery. \"That does not look like hereditary disease, does it ? \" he asked, pleading for a hopeful answer. \" Those are good signs, no doubt. Your wife is of an active temperament, highly nervous, but with a very happy disposition. Her sister's fatal illness has tried her severely ; but we must look to the arising of a new interest as the best cure for sorrow.\" \" Poor Peggy ! Yes, we shall brood less upon her loss when we have our little one to think about.\" The thought of Eve's coming happiness as a mother was his chief comfort. She could not fail to be consoled by the infant whose tender life would absorb her every thought, whose sleeping and waking would be a source of interest and anxiety. But before the consoler's coming there"], [288, "280 THE VENETIANS. was a dreary interval of weeks to be bridged over, and this was a cause of fear. There was a journey to be taken, for the climate of Cannes would be too hot for health, or even for endurance, before mother and child could be moved. Thus it was imperative that they should move without delay. Indeed, Van sittart thought they could not too soon leave the house and garden so closely associated with the image of the dead \u2014 where everything recalled Peggy, and the alternating hopes and fears of those gradual, sad stages on her journey to the grave. On this path her feet had tripped so lightly last February, when her illness was talked of as \" only a cough.\" Under this giant eucalyptus her couch had been established in April, when walking had become a painful effort, and she could only lie and absorb the beauty of her surroundings, and talk of the coming days in which she would be strong again, and able to go up to the Signal with Jack. Vansittart fancied that Eve would catch eagerly at the idea of leaving that haunted house ; but her grief increased at the thought of going away."], [289, "PEGGY'S CHANCE. 281 \" I like to be here in the place she loved.
