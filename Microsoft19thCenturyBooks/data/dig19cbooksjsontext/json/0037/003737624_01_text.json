I communicated with my good friend Mr. William Hayley, who is a conftant communicant to my Gentleman s Magazine, both in verfe and profe, that is to fay, in rhyme and criticifm ; \u2014 whom I may rightly term one of the great pillars of my Gentleman s Magazine, which every Gentleman in the kingdom, I hope, reads, \u2014 which, if he doth not read, I hope he will read, as it is not only the greateft favourite with our Moft Gracious Sovereign, who is the greateft Monarch upon earth, \u2014 but alfo with his Nobles, who are men of judgement and learning; alfo with foreign parts, who tranflate it conftantly into their language: \u2014 fo that, if I may be permitted to verfify the praife of my monthly Publication B (for"], [6, "2 (for indeed I muft own I have a great itch for poetry), I will do it in this poetical diftich : My Magazine all magazines excels ; And, what's flill better too for John, it fells. I afked Mr. Hayley, paying him the compliment firft, if he would be the champion to ehcounter this great Mr. Peter Pindar. To this, Mr. Hayley replied, after fome hefitation, and pondering, and blowing his nofe in his handkerchief, that he did not much admire a public exhibition ; that it would wear the afpect of a bruifing match, too much like a fet-to of Johnfion and Big Ben ; but added that / might do it, if I thought proper. 11 But,\" fays my good Friend, \" I will privately attack him, under a fictitious fignature;\" \u2014 which he did indeed, and gave the audacious Fellow many a good thump, in verfe and profe : \u2014 but this was only fmall fhot, with deference to Mr. Hayley ; the grand artillery was referved for me. Kind Reader, wilt thou permit me to fay fomething of myfelf, in fimplicity and candour, before I go to work with this Caliban ? When I firft took the chair of criti- cifm,"], [7, "3 cifm, I own that I trembled ; for I am not afhamed to confefs, that fo great was my ignorance, that when a cor refpondent fent me an account of an ancient coin, I did not know a fy 11 able about it \u2014 neither the meaning of reverfie, exergue, or legend : but now, thank Godj I know every thing appertaining to numifimata, if I may be indulged with a Latin expreflion. Indeed the legends ufed to perplex me much, in as much as I expofed myfelf greatly ; for I am not afhamed to confefs my ignorance. I thought that AUG. upon a Homan Medal, meant the month in which it was ftruck off y and therefore I deemed it Auguft : and G. P. R. which I now know to be Genio Populi Romani, I verily thought to be a coin ftruck by one George Peter Richardfon. The figures of Romulus and Remus lucking a fhe-wolf, I took to be two children milking a cow. D. M. for Diis Manibus, I took to be David Martin, or Daniel Mufgrove. The half-word HEL. fignifying Heliopolis, I imagined to be no other than the Houfe of Satan. JAN. CLU. that is to fay, Janum clufit, I took to be the name of a man. LUD. SiEC. F. I verily thought to be downright filthy, -and blufhed for the Romans : but, lo, I afterwards difcovered it to be Ludos ficeculares fiecit. COS. I thought to be Cos"], [8, "4 Cos Lettuces, which only meaneth Confiul ; M. F. Mr. Ford, which meaneth Marci Filius. N. C. (wouldft thou think it, Reader ?) I tranflated Nincompoop ; when, lo, it meaneth Nobiliffimus Ccefiar. P. P. which figni fieth Pater Patriae, I thought might mean Peter Pounce, or Philip Pumpkin. R. P. I alfo thought might mean Robert Penruddock, or Ralph Pigwiggin, or any other name beginning with thofe initials : but, lo, its true meaning I find to be Refipublica, fignifying, in Englifh, the Republic. \u2014 Thus i-t will appear that I am not afhamed to confefs my error, which this Enemy of mine dareth not. TRIE. POT. which only meaneth Tribunitia Poteftate, I actually imagined meant a Tribe of Potatoes, and that the coin was ftruck on account of a plentiful year of that fruit. S. P. Q^R. which meaneth only Senatus Populus que Rcmanus, unwilely, yet funnily, did I make out to be Sam Paddon, a Queer Rogue ; for as much as I was informed that the Romans ftruck coins on every trifling occafion. SC1P. AS. which fig-nifieth no more than O Scipio Afiricanus, I read literally Skip Afs ; but for why, I could not fay : \u2014 fuch was my ignorance. Many"], [9, "5 Many were the impofitions upon me : \u2014rings for pigs nofes were fent me for nofe -jewels worn by the Roman Ladies ; a piece of oxycroceum, juft made in a druggifl's fhop, for the pitch that furrounded the body of Julius Ca?far ; a large brown Jordan, for a lacrymatory ; a broken old black fugar-bafon, for a druid urn ; a piece of. a watchman's old lantern, for a Roman lamp. The wig of the famous Boerhaave was alfo fent me as a curiofity ; the roguery of which I did not difcover till an engraving of the wig was nearly nnifhed, cofting me upwards of thirty millings : \u2014 for, lo ! Reader, this great Man never wore a wig in his life. \u2014 In my Obituary too I made great miflakes, from impofition ; as I gave the deaths of many that were not dead, and others that never exifted. Some times the wickednefs of correfpondents was fuch, that I have perpetuated the deaths of bull-dogs, greyhounds^ mafliffs, horfes, hogs, &c. in my Obituary, under an idea that they were people of confequenc-e. Indeed I have not fluck to the letter of my affertion at the head of my Obi tuary, that declares it to be a record of confiderable per fons; for as much as I have fometimes put a fcavenger over a Member of Parliament, a pig-driver over a Bifhop, a lamp-lighter over an Alderman, and a chimney-fweeper over a Duke : but as I was defired by the friends of the C deceafed"], [10, "6 deceafed to do it, (for who is not ambitious ?) and as I was paid for it too, (and who can withftand a fee ?) I have in fome little meafure difgraced my Journal, and forfeited my word. \u2014 My prefent antiquarian knowledge, gratitude maketh me confefs that I owe it all to Mr. R. Gough, of Enfield, who fome years ago was alfo an ignorant and illiterate Gentleman, like myfelf, \u2014 but, by hard ftudy, hath attained to his prefent perfection, as may be feen in our Topographia Britajmica, which is not, as that arch-enemy Peter Pindar hath afferted it to be, the idle production of a couple of fellows that want to make a fortune by a hiftory of cobwalls, old chamber-pots, and rufty nails. My friend Mr. Gough's zeal for the pro motion of antiquarian knowledge cannot be better proved than by his running the rifk of being well trounced, for borrowing one of King Edward's fingers, as he lay expofed, a few years fince, in Weflminfter Abbey ; which finger, my friend, after having gently put it in his pocket,, was, by order of the Bifhop of Rochefler, who, unluckily feeing the deed, did, to the difgrace of the fcience, order him to be fearched, and forced him to refund. Had it not been for this impertinent and hawk-eyed attention of the Bifhop, Sir Jofeph Ayloffe, and other Antiquarians prefent at the opening of the Monarch's coffin, \u2014 fuch was the intrepidity"], [11, "7 intrepidity of my antiquarian friend Gough, that he would have attempted the head, inftead of a pitiful finger, as he had on a large watchman's coat for the purpofe. Nor mufl I omit the zeal of my friend Sir Jofeph Banks on the occafion ; who, on hearing what was going on, and fufpeding that King Edward might have been lodged in pick4e, galloped off with a gallon jug, in a hackney-coach, in order to fill it with the precious liquor, as a fauce for his future Attic enter tainments in Soho-fquare : but unfortunately no pickla was found. I confefs that an impudent fellow fent me for my Obituary the following, which was really printed off (but cancelled) before I was informed, by a friend, of the fal lacy \u2014 to wit : \" On Sunday night laft died Mrs. Margery \" Moufier, a widow Lady, beloved in life, and lamented \" in death ;. fhe was the only daughter of Roger Grimalkin, \u00a3 Efquire, of Ratley'r \u2014 Ignorant indeed was I that it was an impofition ; for, gentle Reader, it was a dead cat ! \u2014 \u2022 Many a good cuftomer have I gained by my Obituary, who liked to fee themfelves dead in my Magazine \u2014 I mean their relations liked to fee their deaths difplayed in a work of fo much refpectability as mine. \u2014 But enough of myfelf; and now for Mafter Peter.
