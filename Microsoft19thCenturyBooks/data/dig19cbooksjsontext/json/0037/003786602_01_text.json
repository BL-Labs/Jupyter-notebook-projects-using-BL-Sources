In reverting to your predecessors, I cannot but contrast their cold ness with your enthusiasm ; and it would give me sincere pleasure to know that this effort might yield to you as much as a former one produced to them. At least, the adaptor would have less reason to be dissatisfied, or I am much mistaken in your charac ter. With the sincerest wishes for the continued suc cess of the great national concern under your direc tion, I beg you to accept this tribute to the openness and sincerity of your conduct towards me as a con tributor to your literary novelties, and to believe ;.ie, Dear Sir, \"Very faithfully yours, JOHN HOWARD PAYNE.

On it was written Havre, January 10, and it bore a black seal inscribed Octavus. The parcel contained two productions of M. Victor,--\" Calas\" and \" Therese.\" The uncommon merit of \" Calas,\" with which the British public is already fa miliar, induced me to read the new work of its ingenious author ; and I could not hesitate in deciding upon its fit ness for the London Stage. On Thursday night the adap tation was begun, and finished on the Monday nio-ht fol lowing. Mr. Elliston accepted it for representation on Fri day evening, Jan. 27, and produced it on Friday, Feb. 2. \u2014 At the last rehearsal all were in despair, \u2014 so unexampled was the celerity with which it had been urged forward : but all seemed inspired when the hour of trial came, \u2014 and I never saw a new piece better acted, or more enthusiasti cally applauded. If I am indebted to M. Victor for the compliment which has been paid so mysteriously, I beg to return my thanks for it ; and at the same time to ask his indulgence towards some alterations in the construction of his drama, especially in the third act. Could he witness the effect of one of these variations, through the admirable performance of Miss KeIiLY, he would require no apology for the li berties I have taken : nor will the other ornaments of the"], [8, "6 PREFACE. drama deem any particular notice of my obligations to Miss Kelly, in the slightest degree invidious to them. Indeed, they would rather anticipate me; \u2014 her fellow labourers know her talent better than the public : \u2014 they can observe it better. As she wrote in the pa- vilion the public could not see her brushing the tears which blotted the letters as she was forming them ; and number- less similar instances of refinement, perhaps even more genuine, for being less obtrusive. But in the closing scenes of deep pathos, all could share in the agonising interest she excited : all could seel that her acting was unaffected \u2014 irresistible : \u2014 It was the orphan, deserted, but not de- spairing: \u2014 it was the resigned hopelessness of the pious, broken, spirit, \u2014 too sensitive to look back without tears to what it has lost on earth, yet too religious to falter in its hope from '\u25a0 ' eaven ! \u2014 It was a picture of the most exqui- site, heart-drawn touches, equal in merit to the best con ceptions of the best poets and painters ; and leaving the beholders only to lament that, like kindred emanations of its sister arts, the beautiful image could not be fixed for ihe admiration of distant times and ages, when the gifted tady, whose genius has given it soul and loveliness, shall live only in her fame. In a play which I published three or four years ago, I had occasion to bear testimony to the merits of Mr. Wallace, and I then predicted his professional success. I have bow to thank him on other grounds. In taking the character which he sustains so ably in this drama, he has dispensed with a privilege in his engagement, by which he reserves the right of rejecting any part in a secondary play ; thus handsomely acknowledging the kindnesses which he has so recently received from my beloved native country, by his ardour in upholding the interest of one of the hnmWest of her sons."], [9, "PREFACE. 7 It would be well for the cause of virtue, if all Pastors were equal in eloquence aud impressiveness to Mr. Coc per in Fontaine. Mr. Knight is one of those performers whom Authors ought especially to honor. He enters into their anxieties with enthusiasm, and never lends his talent to their productions without success. To Mr. Knight and Mr. Gat tie my thanks are especially owing, not only for what they did, but for the sincere gratification Avhich they appeared to feel on my account, more than on their own, that their exertions proved so acceptable to our patrons. Mrs. Egerton, Mrs Harlowe, and Mr. Barnard, gave strength to characters perhaps not over affluent in op portunities for effect : and even the Magistrate ceased to be insignificant in the hands of Mr. Bromley. One word to my friends, the Criticks, and I have done. They have honoured me already with more attention than I ever coveted : but I wish them to understand that this, like former publications of mine, is a work planned for stage-effect exclusively, and only printed for managers and actors. It is so necessary in the productions of the modern drama to consult the peculiarities of leading per formers ; \u2014 and not to offend the restive spirit of audiences, requiring strong excitement by means of situations almost pantomimick, and too impatient to pause for poetical beauty ; \u2014 that it seems almost hopeless to look to the stage as, the vehicle for permanent literary distinction. An acted, (or I might say more properly, an actable) play, seems to derive its value from what is done, more than from what is said) ;\u2014 but the great power of a literary work consists in what is said and the manner of saying it : He, therefore, who best knows the stage, can best tell why, in the present"], [10, "PREFACE. 8 temper of audiences, good poets should so often make bad dramatists. Should my better stars ever give me leisure or independence, to devote myself to any literary work which I may hope to render worthy of being recollected, I shall select something in which the imagination may be less fet- tered than it must be by the necessities of the stage. As yet I am not vain enough to set up as a candidate for literary distinction: I know myself better : but, at the same time, I am not, nor ever have been, (notwithstanding all that has been said of a short preface to a former work) so unprin- cipled as to claim what does not belong to me ; \u2014 and I have only to desire, as a point of common courtesy, that if my ex- cellent good friends should ever do me the honor to censure or quote any of the trifling remarks I have ventured to offer upon the present occasion, they will enhance the obli gatiou by first reading them.

All I have now to ask, Sir, is that he should be secured and shut out from all communication \u2014 [taking Delparc aside] I have a ptan in view, which, my conscience tells me, will bring forth the truth. Grant me a word in private. Car. You exceed your authority in detaining any man without just grounds of suspicion. Delp. You are distinctly accused, Sir, and of course my prisoner.

The Magistrate, Fontaine, Bridget and Lavigne retire last of all. The window shutters are closed, aud the stage darkened. Car. Why, this is more and more inexplicable \u2014 I said nothing \u2014 confessed nothing \u2014 yet this strange person brands me on a sudden \u2014 Can I bear traces on my dress ? \u2014 Perhaps her blood ? \u2014No \u2014 I see none ! \u2014 Ha ! the papers ! \u2014 Some may have fallen! \u2014 They regard her innocence \u2014 [searching eagerly, and drawing out the papers] One \u2014 two \u2014 three! \u2014No \u2014 no\u2014 all here\u2014all right\u2014 all right [\u2014-[replacing them in his bosom] Come, manly resolution be my shield !\u2014 I am suspected. \u2014 nothing more ; \u2014 but they caa haA'eno proof, nor certainty.

Twelve soldiers, six on \u25a0-ach side, with drawn swords, march down on the right and left band: .liter them, six male villagers, three on each side, and next, twelve le niile villagers, six on each side. The characters follow. The Count makes a movement of indignation on seeing Carwin. Delparc takes the <rntre; Lavigne is at the right hand, the Count, Picard and Fontaine mt, the Magistrate in th,e centre, and Caiwin in the left-hand coiner : re affects perfect composure, 'th\" middle door is closed, and part of the subordinate characters are standing before it.

(Carwin betrays surprise, but instanllt/ recovers his self-possession.) To escape conviction will be impos sible ; but you may even yet appease the wrath of him whose image you have horribly destroyed, by a confession of your guilt. Car. A moment since (pointing to Fontaine) my accuser Avas the judge ; now the judge is my accuser ! \u2014 'Twere trouble thrown away to protest against the decency or ho nesty of this colluuon, since the whole charge can be re futed in one word:\u2014 I was not here, and I defy ye to the proof!
