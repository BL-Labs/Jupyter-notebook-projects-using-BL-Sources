The several companies at work seem to be pretty well satisfied with the yield of their claims, a proof in itself that they arc being tolerably well remunerated for their labor. The Lucky Doctor and Derwent Companies claims have been particularly rich from this fact, together with the water-worn appearance of the gold, the vast quantity of very much rounded quartz boulders met with in the wash ing stuff, and other circumstances connected therewith. I think it unquestionable that the lead referred to does exist, and that if ma chinery sufficiently powerful were brought to bear upon the deep ground, so as to overcome the difficulties presented in the shape of water, that the ground might be even moderately prospected, some very rich deposits would be discovered. machinery than they have at present, before they resume work. The water broke into the north end of the main drive, indicating that the gutter lies still further north than the posi tion of their late workings, and rose so as to swamp the claim very rapidly. The prospects of the company prior to this mishap were very good, the average yield of the washing stuff being as high as 46 oz. per machine. Durham Company. \u2014 This company has re sumed operations, and is now proceeding with the sinking of the new shaft by contract. The contract for sinking through the rock has been let at \u00a314 per foot, the company finding all necessary machinery and materials. Inkermann Lead. \u2014 The Allied Armies Com pany is engaged in working the reef, the gutter claim being worked out. The Ophir Company has been stopped during the last fortnight ; the dividends previous to suspending operations, were \u00a33 15s. per week per share. The Great Republic Company continues to work steadily ; the average wages per share, after deducting expenses, obtained by this company are \u00a36 per week. The Hand-in- Hand Company has raised during the month 600 o/. of gold ; the working expenses are about \u00a380 per week, and the dividends have been \u00a36 per week per share. The several other companies carrying on mining operations on this lead are situated on private property, and in consequence thereof no reliable in formation can be obtained regarding then workings. Golden Point Lead. \u2014 The Cosmopolitan Company is continuing operations with vigor, and is being tolerably well remunerated. The quantity of gold raised by the company during the month is 540 oz. The weekly dividends during the month have been \u00a35, \u00a37, \u00a316. and \u00a37 10s. The Kohinoor Company is continuing to drive their new level in order to reach the gutter, and at present is in about 425 sect, the stratum being driven through is soft slate. Redan Lead.\u2014 The Golden Gate and Great Extended Companies arc being well remune rated for their labor. The Golden Gate Com pany has raised since January 25th, 1859, the date of striking the gutter up to the present time, 25,560 oz. The Great Extended Com pany, from April 11th, 1860, the date upon which the gutter was struck by this company, up to date has raised 7577 oz. The dividends of these two companies during the month have been:\u2014 Golden Gate Company \u00a322 and \u00a317, Great Extended Company \u00a324 and \u00a322. Frenchman's Lead. \u2014 The Albion Company is still driving in search of the lead, and it is to be hoped that the unremitting labors of this company will soon be crowned with success Sago Hill. \u2014 No new claims have been taken up in this locality during the month, nor has the situation of the lead, supposed to extend from the Lucky Doctor and Derwent Com- Campbell's Gully. \u2014 The several parties en gaged in puddling in this gully are pursuing their work successfully. The surface, though on the whole poor, still, from the great quan tity put through the machines, pays from \u00a33 to \u00a35 per week per man wages. There are occasionally instances of greater remuneration ; this occurs when patches (which is not infre quent) are met with. In the claim of Cum mings and party the wages for the month have been as high as \u00a37 per man per week. From an examination of the geological features of this locality, it would appear that a lead extends from this gully. The traces of gold bearing quartz reefs are to be seen fre quently cropping out, from which specimens have been frequently obtained. The outlet from the gully is south westerly from the diggings ; the bed-rock has a general ten dency to fall in this direction, and at a distance of about a mile from the prospecting claim, the situation of which has been shown upon the plan already furnished of these diggings, trap rock is met with, and extends round north easterly to the township of Ballaarat, and south-easterly towards the Buniuyong race course, forming a sort of tongue, where it joins the schist at the opening of the gully. In places presenting similar appearances \"where the trap has flowed to a great distance up between the schist ranges, it has generally been ascertained that very deep ground or gutters exist ; for instance, the Suburban and Inker mann Leads, and where such gutters exist if the surrounding ranges bear the appearance' of having been auriferous, or if surface hills are discovered close adjoining, it has also been ascertained that these gutters have contained leads of gold. From these premises I think it might be fairly inferred, that a lead extends from this gully south-westerly till it fans beneath the trap, and that it then eradnnllv turns following the. south-easterly direction o\"f the same towards the half-way house on the Smythesdale road, and thence' till it joins the"], [11, "MINING SURVEY0K8 REPORTS \u2014 JANUARY. 3 leads south of Sebastopol, following the direction of the River Leigh. If I am correct in regard to this matter, and I see no reasonable cause of doubt (however the matter is well worthy of strict investiga tion), a new field might be opened for the employment of capital and labor, and another lead might be added to the many rich leads that have rendered Ballaarat famous as a gold field. number of Chinese are engaged in puddling the sludge and debris from the abandoned claims of Europeans, and from their eagerness to get hold of some of those claims, I have no doubt they are making at least a good living; in many cases they purchased the right to work the same from Europeans holding quartz claims on the abandoned alluvial workings. Quartz Mining. \u2014 The opinion expressed by me in my last report of an increased activity in this branch of mining I am happy to say is verified by the fact that several applications have been made, during the past month, for abandoned quartz claims ; and the working shareholders in companies in full operation are eager to invest in, and in many instances are the first to take up those claims, which I attribute to the practical knowledge of reefs gained by them in working and the favorable returns received from what miners call unlikely looking quartz. The operations of the different companies on the Black Hill are as yet chiefly confined to open cuttings or to comparatively shallow levels from shafts, and in no instance has any quartz been raised from below a level of 100 feet, nor are any of the companies likely, for a length of time yet, to extend their workings to deep levels while they get good paying returns from the shallow levels. I forward detail plan and sections of the Lucky 1 loctor and Derwent Companies' claims Sago Hill. No. 2 Division, (P. C. Eitzpatrick, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 \u25a0 The five crushing machines on this hill con tinue to be actively employed, with steady average returns, as mentioned in the tabular form in my last report, and I believe another machine in a good situation would find plenty to do, crushing at a reasonable price for the smaller companies. Little Bendigo \u2014 Band of Hope Reef. \u2014 The average crushing of the Band of Hope Com pany for the past montlT has been 115 tons weekly, yielding fully 10 dwt. to the ton. The One-and-All 80 tons, average 13^ dwt. The Temperance Company commenced crush ing the first week in January, and reduced, in three weeks, 240 tons, yielding 134 oz. They are raising quartz from two levels 60 and 90 ft., but have not noticed any appreciable difference in the yield from the respective levels. The reef (in working north from their shaft in the lower level) varies from 20 to 30 inches and is encased in a soft argillaceous slate, easily worked; and in prosecuting the same level to the south, it diminishes to 6 inches, which they attribute to the ground being very tight, the reef being encased in a hard sandstone, and consequently not at all profitable to work. Running parallel with and about 300 feet from the Band of Hope is the Sisters Reef, on which the Combined United Miners are erect ing a 16 horse-power engine, with twelve stamps, the prospect obtained from a trial crushing was 1 1 dwt. to the ton. About 30 chains north of this claim the British United The machinery is as follows : \u2014 In reporting on the alluvial mining in my division, I have no change of importance to notice. The few companies who are working with machinery are making very little more than current wages after paying expenses ; but there are instances of small parties working horse puddling machines on old ground doing remarkably well. I may mention Baker and party of four men, on Mopoke Gully, realising for one week's work in December, over 90 oz . of gold, and a Chinese party immediately adjoining washing 94 oz. from one machine; there are also a couple of parties in Cockatoo Gully averaging \u00a310 per man per week.

Company have had a trial crushing of 24 tons, the yield from which was 21 oz. 5 dwt., and from this favorable return are about to erect machinery immediately. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The other engines in course of erection are the Livingstone Company, on the Yorkshire Reef, which is remarkable for introducing a new invention on this gold field, which consists in substituting cast iron frame-work for carry ing the cam shaft and supporting the stamp rods, entirely doing away with the ponderous wood framing above the foundation bed A considerable time is saved in erecting this frame work, and the expense about 20 per cent, above the ordinary wood framing. The Victoria Company, on the \"Victoria Reef, are erecting a 15 horse-power engine, to drive twelve stamps, and will be ready for crushing in about three weeks. The Welling ton Company, Dead Horse Gully, a 16 horse power engine, twelve stamps, prospect 6 dwt. to the ton. will be ready for crushing in about one month. A great reaction has taken place in mining affairs in this district. Where a few months since the ground was completely rushed for 'the ostensible purpose of quartz mining, many of the claims are now lying unoccupied or held in reserve. The main cause of this ap- pears to be the tightness of the money market ; many companies having taken up claims under the impression of obtaining advances with ease, whereas they have met with disappoint- ment, and have, consequently, been unable to carry on their works. Many of the claims however, which are now lying idle, will, no doubt, in the course of time, be permanently worked, as great inducements are being held out to them Firstly, by their being able in a short time to obtain a per- manent supply of water from the Government reservoir now being erected, and rapidly approaching to completion ; and, secondly by those companies which have been able to erect machinery having met with a fail- return up to the present date. The following are the only companies having made any advancement worthy of note during the last month. Hiscock's Reef.\u2014 The Imperial Company have crushed 600 tons, at the yield of 230 ounces At the adjoining company, the Standard, the quartz not being in a sufficiently large body to keep the machinery continually at work, the crushing has been small, yet yielded about 6 dwt. to the ton.

The company known as Dinnock and party, on the north side of the Little Bendigo Creek, after working without intermission for twelve months, has at length got an excellent prospect of 9 dwt. to the ton (40 tons crushed), at a depth of 180 feet. This company raised quartz from different levels before reaching this depth, and could not get over 1 J dwt. to the ton.but being in a position to prospect further, have persevered, and been rewarded with the above results.

Alluvial. \u2014 Nothing of any consequence has transpired in the alluvial mining. Those shafts in the Durham and Napoleon Leads not yet through the rock are still persevering in their endeavours to reach the gutter, and those which have struck it are working with the average returns previously reported. I have the honor to forward the following report of the state of this mining district for the month of December, 1860 : \u2014 The aspect of affairs haB undergone very little change since the date of my last report. During the latter part of the month there waa a general quietness in mining operations, and the earlier part has not been remarkable for any noticeable departure from the steady course of business which is becoming the leading characteristic of this division. The discovery of a new lead at the southern base of the Black Hill, by the Homeward- Bound Company, has been formally reported, and the usual official action consequent on such an event has been taken by me. I have no doubt but it will prove to be a valuable lead, but it will not have much immediate influence on the condition of the miners here, as the prospecting claim abuts on private property, and of course occupation under and in virtue of miners' rights cannot be given. The sluicing and puddling company at the Black Hill are in full working order ; their arrangements are very good. If the quality of the ground be such as has been represented they cannot fail of turning it to profitable account, but up to the present time the returns have been by no means encouraging. The Lord Palmerston and Golden Gate Companies are doing first-rate. The last company are averaging 20 oz. to the machine, and obtained 130 oz. for the last week's return. Such produce has considerably enhanced the value of the other claims in the neighborhood. The Reliance Company are getting paying wash-dirt on the reef. This company have had great difficulties to overcome, consequently their progress has been rather slow. The situation of the claim could be hardly better chosen for the union of the Browne's and Smythe's Leads, and there is a strong proba bility of a junction with the Hong Kong Lead also in this claim, after which the united leads will pass through the claim of the Smythesdale and Browne's Junction Company ; thence through the late claim on allotment 4 Scarsdale, and subsequently through the private property of Lewis and Perrot. The Scarsdale and Gemini Company, boring at the south of the private property just adverted to, have also proved the deep ground in their claim, which extends near to the north fence of Browne's pre-emptive right. Several tributaries will fall into the main lead before it arrives at the last-mentioned point ; some of them are already well-attested leads, such as the Monkey Gully and Italian Leads, and_the Black Hill and Oldham Leads The Mines Royal, Red Hill, and Caledonian Companies, have been getting moderate dividends during the month. The Hand-in- Hand, leasehold, has been hitherto the greatest failure I have witnessed on Browne's, almost No. 6 Division. (John Lynch, Mining Surveyor.)

The matter of chief interest in mining at Linton's has been the bottoming of the Atlas shaft. It is about 10 feet too shallow for the computed depth of the Standard Lead, but deep enough for the Royal Standard and Flag staff Leads : the bottom consists of soit green clay slate, over which lay a small seam of black clav and sand such as is usually found on the slopes and margins of deep gutters. There was a little gold of a very nuggety description found on the bottom. The John Bull Company boring near the north fence of Linton station have reached a depth of 90 feet, so that unless a new lead is coming from the eastern ranges through the John Bull ground it is still doubtfid whether the Standard Lead goes through the station or to the westward through the Atlas leasehold. No other new occurrence has transpired at Linton's since my last report, At Lucky Woman's matters are improving. The Ivanhoe Company have got a very encou raging prospect. The Tam o'Shanter Com pany have proved the lead up to the boundary of the Ivanhoe, and in addition to this which of itself would be enough to make their claim valuable, the Ivanhoe Company believe they will have a portion of the main lead from Linton's. The Don Juan, Albion and Lucky Claims, which follow the Ivanhoe in succession, are growing daily into favor owing to the in creasing value of the immediately preceding claims. The North American Company are at last in a fair way of prosecuting operations. From the numerous delays which they have had through the insufficiency of their old steam engine, this company have been greviously affected ; they have lately purchased a larger one. the erection of which is nearly completed. Shares in this company are quoted at \u00a3200. The British, Robin Hood, Grand Junction, and Cleft of the Rock, which succeed the North American on a continuation of the same lead, have their works in various stages of progress. The Try Again Company, who have fruit lessly expended sixteen months in driving a tunnel, have abandoned it, and are now sinking a shaft in the ravine called the Devil's Kitchen. Adjoining this, at the south side, is the Grand Iriink Protection Claim, which is 4000 feet long, and supposed to be on the trunk lead formed of the various leads proceeding from Linton's. Lucky Woman's, and Sprino* D-illah on the one side, and Smvthe's Browne's -ind Italian Gully, on the other. The observance of a simple geological fact has enabled this company to choose a proper situation for their shaft, which otherwise might have cost the immense expenditure of monev and labor m every system of working it to advantage has been from time to time adopted, nevertheless I do not thiok it is defraying current expenses The Grand Junction, leasehold, has been for some time past very unsteady in its yield, it seems the gold is very partially distributed in this claim ; various small quartz veins traverse the claim, and in close connection with these veins the wash-dirt is found to be very good, whilst it is of a very indifferent character where these do not exist. The United Browne's claim is doing very well. The ground is uniformly of a paying nature, and the management can be scarcely surpassed. The Beaumont Company, Smythesdale, are getting generally from \u00a312 to \u00a320 per man, weekly. This claim is decidedly the best that has been on Warren's Lead, and is supposed to owe its superior richness to a tributary from the shallow workings on German Hill, under which the claim is immediately situated. The Surprise, Britannia, Morning Light, Young Pioneer, Old Pioneer, Sir Henry Barkly, Perseverance, and Star of Hope claims, occu pying the Smythesdale Flat, are as usual, some times making wages, but more frequently exceeding it. The large extent of ground which these several companies occupy had been once abandoned as unprofitable, yet the present holders are now working it to advantage, a fact which argues a great improvement in the mode of operations pursued at present over that which prevailed two years ago. Near Monkey Gully the discovery of a new quartz reef has been reported; a great portion of the ground has been applied for, on mining lease, by the discoverer, and a few claims have been taken up by holders of miners' rights Griffith's quartz claim on the Lancashire Reef has been considered the best yet discovered in that locality. It is situated within 400 yards to the westward of the newly-discovered reef just alluded to. The Victoria Reef, Browne's is not turning out so well as was expected, but they attribute some loss to a defective amal gamating apparatus, which they have set about improving. The yields from the other quartz claims in this neighborhood are so fluctuating that it is very difficult to lay down their value with any tolerable degree of accuracy. The Havelock and Prince of Wales Companies Monkey Gully continue to give from \u00a310 to \u00a320 per man weekly. 1 he Italian Gull}' claims present no new feature requiring especial notice. Their characters have been several times described by me in previous reports. The Magna Charta Company are not yet into the gutter, but they have been for some time back working a tributary lead which turns out from 8 oz. to 1 2 oz. to the machine ; they are driving now in the supposed level of the gutter and expect to get into it daily ; the usual indication of the proximity of a gutter"], [15, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS JANUARY. 7 out and large quantities of earth disposed of. The Britannia and Johnson's Reef will be soon both in active operation. The machinery of Mr. Johnson is the best of its kind in the district ; until he commences to crush, the fate of the reef will remain as problematical as it has remained since its discovery two years ago, the other holders of claims there being very dilatory in taking effectual steps to prove it up to the present. [The foregoing report for the month of December arrived too late for publication with the other reports for that month.] The eluiin stands on a very high plateau covered over with trap rock. A very remark- able sameness prevails around for a great dis- tance, except where the course of the creek intersects the claim ; and here the creek has furrowed a channel nearly 200 feet deep, form- ing banks entirely dissimilar in their outline \u2014 one side being precipitous and irregular, with large massive blocks of basalt protruding through it at various depths, to the bed of the creek, whilst the other has a regular and uniform slope from top to bottom, is tufted over with rich and luxuriant grass, exposes no rock ex- cept at the surface, and at one particular spot where a wall or column of basalt rises perpen- dicularly from the creek to the surface, and here only renders the configuration of both banks identical. These remarkable features led the company to suppose that the present water course constitutes the separating line of two distinct formations ; and upon trial this conjecture was readily verified, for they sunk several shafts at different levels along the sloping bank, and struck in each of them the primitive schist a few feet beneath the surface, except at the particular place already alluded to where the basaltic rock juts promiuently forward, exhibiting such striking resemblance to that section of the bank immediately opposite it as leaves no doubt of both being once joined, nor of this wall of basalt filling up the bed of the ancient river, and overflowing the then existing valley until it came in contact with the sides of the schistose hills surrounding. It is this line of contact which the modern river has followed, gradually deepening its channel to the present level, and demonstrating by the result of an extensive erosian the occur- rence of a more powerful aqueous agency in times past than any we witness now. The situation of the shaft is chosen at a few feet above the high water level of the creek. and on the gorge through which the wall of basalt referred to, is wedged between the schis- tose hills which bounded the sides of the an- cient creek, or in mining phraseology \u2014 the gutter, thus avoiding over 150 feet of hard rock, besides the incalculable advantage of being enabled to discover the course of the gutter without boring or any expensive trials. Very near the Grand Trunk claim, and al- most parallel with it is the Scotchman's Reef. Some late trials of crushing from this reef turned out 10 dwt. person. A lease of 900 yards was then applied for by the company and they have contracted for a steam ergine and stamping batteries, which will be on the ground in a few days ; this reef is remarkable for great quantities of iron pyrites. The Snake Valley claims at Carngham have been doing better for the last two months than at any former period, but this improvement I attribute to the claims being approaching that final stage where the ground can be blocked No. 6 Division.

The most material improvement has taken place in the yield of some of the claims on Smythesdale ; for instance, the Great Western claim, now being worked for nearly three years, and with very indifferent results, has startled us at once with the magnitude of its improvement ; during the last week of the month the company washed out 413 oz., and Occupation.

If they do not succeed a more powerful engine must be procured, inis ground is decidedly the most diftcuft ot management I have seen in the district, con sidering that the depth does not exceed 50 feet, and is entirely free from hard rock. The Beaumont and Caledonian Companies, Warren's Lead, are doing well, the dividends of the former always maintaining a high average. I think they may be quoted at \u00a320 per man weekly, whilst those of the latter never fall below \u00a35 per week, and oftentimes reach the high figure of the Beaumont. The Hand in-Hand Company are sinking a new shaft ; the Grand Junction scarcely realizing wages ; the Red Hill Company slightly in advance of wages ; whilst the Mines Royal are obtaining about \u00a315 per week. These several claims are contiguous to each other, yet the disparity in value is very con siderable. The Reliance, situated in advance of the Mines Royal, have not made much pro gress up to the present. They have obtained some wash-dirt, but of a very indifferent quality. They are now proceeding with a main drive in the \"direction of the trunk lead, and are re solved that no further delays shall be permitted in the prosecution of the work until it is reached and thoroughly tested. What has chiefly tended to retard operations hitherto has been the quantity of labor misapplied in carrying on subsidiary prospecting drives wherever black clay or any indications of auriferous ground presented themselves. The depth of this shaft is over 200 feet. The Golden Gate, situated on allotment 2, Scars dale, is an excellent claim It is supposed to stand on the confluence of the Cr\u0153sus and Hong Kong Leads, both of which leads are of a tolerably remunerative character. On allotment 3. Scarsdale, is situated the Smythe's and Browne's Junction Claim, which, as its title implies, is supposed to cover the main trunk lead, formed of those proceeding from Smythe's and Browne's, with their various branches and affiliations. The shaft was bot tomed at 180 feet on the reef. This is about 60 or 70 feet too shallow ; the course of the gutter, as indicated by the dip of the reef, is to the south of the shaft, and apparently very convenient thereto but the probability is, that it is the Hong Kong and Cr\u0153sus Leads that is indicated here, and that the junction with the main lead will take place further towards the east. on the 1st instant 170 oz As usual, specu lation is rife as to the probable cause of such a sudden change, but the most likely is. a wash from the German Hill up to the base of which the operations of the company have now ex tended. The Perseverance Company, also on Smythes dale Flat, have had \u00a316 per man for one week, and have become assured from a recent examination of their ground, that further im provement may be expected, besides a longer duration of work than they have hitherto anticipated. The Surprise have done little since they bottomed their new shaft. The Britannia and Sir Henry Barkly have experienced a slight advance on past returns. The Young Pioneer are nearly worked out, and the Old Pioneer are busily engaged in fixing up machinery to work the southern extremity of their claim bordering on the Morning Light. The latter company have quite unexpectedly driven into excellent ground towards the northern portion of their claim under Clyde street, which will give them employment for months to come ; this lucky incident comes with more than usual acceptability, as they had not very san guine hopes of any paying ground in that direction, and had thought their claim was near worked out. It is my opinion, founded on a variety of facts collated from the work ings of the several compauies in this locality, that the greater portion of the Smythe's Creek Flat will give profitable employment to our mining community for years to come A new lead, proceeding from the range near Whybrow's Gully at the west side of the creek has been discovered by Mr. Kingrose and party. The trend of the lead is towards the Roxburgh Lead, with which it will soon join, unless some unexpected deflection takes place in its course ; the prospect has been very good, as may be inferred from the fact of gold being plentifully visible in the wash-dirt, but as no washing has yet taken place there I am unable to state precisely what the value of a given quantity of it mav be. The height of the wash dirt is about six \"feet, and consists principally of gravel, clay, and cement, and the denuded material of the adjacent range, the lower two feet being largely intermixed with yellow mica ceous sand rock, which gives it a clammy and cohesive texture. The ground is shallow, not exceeding 40 feet in depth, and is attended with the addi tional advantage of being comparatively dry, so that, all circumstances considered, it bids fair to become a paying lead. The United Miners (late Last Push Com pany) at the northern extremity of the dis trict have had a temporary cessation, owing to an overpowering quantity of water, but they have inserted a double lift of pumps, and hope that this arrangement will enable them to keep On allotments 4 and 5 the late company are mining ; their shaft is not yet bottomed, but is in a very forward stage, having passed through the rock and into a thick bed of black clay, which seems to be rather abundant there both this and the last mentioned claim have been conducted in a very orderly and work manlike manner, and exliibit a manifest im provement in the conduct of our mines."], [17, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 JANUARY. 9 Next in succession comes the private pro perty of Messrs. Lewis and Perrot. This land is admirably situated for the trunk lead. They have issued a prospectus for the formation of a company but I am not aware how it has been responded to. South of this land and immediately adjoining it is the Scarsdale and Gemini leaseholds. The ground comprised within this area has been well proved by boring, and a shaft will be commenced forthwith. In addition to the main lead this ground will be further enriched by the Oldham Lead, which issues from the Surfacing Range at the western side of the creek within a short distance of the Black Hill. will be very soon blocking out, when they expect their receipts to reach from \u00a360 to \u00a3100 per week; by the time they will have worked out each shareholder will have cleared \u00a31000. The Rip Van Winkle have struck gold in pay ing quantities. The Glamorgan Company have broken into the Standard gutter, and find it uncommonly rich. The Edinburgh Com pany have experienced a decided improvement, the gutter is becoming narrower and richer as they proceed. The John Bull Company and Redan have the whole of the Black Lead to themselves ; the ground is very poor, but by strict economical application of labor they manage to derive very good wages from it. The upper end of the Standard Lead is nearly worked out, and with it the most magnificent lead that we have had yet in this district. The Duke of Cornwall and John Bull boring party have got deep ground on either side of the Edinburgh lease, a circumstance which has given occasion to much conjecture as to which side the Standard Lead goes; this uncertainty is further aggravated in the claims of the Atlas and Pioneer Companies, the former situated, about seven chains west of Linton fence, and the latter about five chains east of the fence, and within Linton farm. Both parties bottomed too shallow and found the bottom of their respective shafts dipping in opposite directions, thus proving the existence of two distinct leads but leaving unsolved the problem as to which course of the two the leads already established are trending. Both parties are prosecuting their work with vigor, so that a few weeks will decide the question. Between the Atlas claim and Lucky Woman's Diggings no mining operations are going on. the intervening space being land alienated from the Crown, and now used for agricultural purposes, The quartz reefs at the head of Browne's, do not appear to prosper well ; the only claims now in good repute there, are Griffiths, on the Lancashire Reef, which has averaged over an ounce to the ton, and Patterson's Reef, ad joining, which has upon a very limited trial yielded 8\u00a7 dwt. to the ton. On Monkey Gully, the Havelock and Prince of Wales Company are doing well \u2014 weekly dividends ranging there from \u00a310 to \u00a320 per man. The Falcon Company have not done so well as might be expected in so advantageous a position as theirs ; they are now engaged in sinking a new shaft, when a turn in then affairs is to be hoped for. The Star of the North, Italian Gully, have acquired an enlargement of claim, have re modelled their company and are working at present in ground which with an economy of labor pays them about \u00a35 per week. The Kossuth Company are beginning to block out ; they are now in a position to dispose of great quantities of earth, and expect a considerable advance upon past receipts. The Prince of Wales, leasehold, have been for several months working splendid ground; their receipts scarcely ever fall under \u00a3 1 0 per week The Waterloo and Cambrian claims, near Browne's fence, have lately commenced to pay, and give pro mising symptoms of becoming valuable claims. Upon a review of the whole condition of the subdivision of Italian Gully it presents a very hopeful guarantee for mining enterprise. Mr. Kinnear's leasehold and that of the Magna Charta Company occupy the United Italian Leads, and in the direction of Smythe's Creek; descriptions and allusions have been so repeat edly made by me to the latter company that it becomes at present unnecessary to enlarge on them, especially as no new incident in relation to it has transpired within the last month; beyond this no attempt at mining has been yet made on the Smythe's Creek side of the district. Very little progress has been made in quartz mining at Linton's, neither do I anticipate any very successful efforts in that branch until the alluvial leads there become less attractive. Lucky Woman's and Spring Dallah stand at present in my opinion higher than any locality of the district. . The North American Claim, near Weston's Hill, and the Ivanhoe and other claims on Slaughter-yard Hill give the most cheering prospects : when these are enriched by the Linton Leads, which undoubtedly must find an outlet here, and when the great extent of the claims are also considered, and the facility with which wood, water, &c, can be obtained on the ground, together with many other advantages which the place supply, we may safely assign it a future of prosperity, in reaching which the temporary difficulties of sinking, &c , vanish into insignificance. The Albion shaft, next the Ivanhoe, is nearly through the rock. The Don Juan are sinking fast, and would have been in a much At Linton our affairs have been looking much better towards the close of the month, notwithstanding that no new ground has been opened there. The Flying Buck Company"], [18, "10 MIXING SURVEYORS REPORTS \u2014 JANUARY. At Carngham mining matters seem also to partake of the general improvement. The whole of the Snake Valley claims are paying well. The Great Britain and Sherwood are blocking out ground capable of gJ\u2122\u00a7 *U> per man weekly. The Red Lion and Bedford shire claims have been paying very well tor a long time, and a considerable quantity of ground remains still unworked there. In the Magnum Bonum there is a decided improve ment, a sample of very large gold having been found by them within the last fortnight, which suggests the probability of a new run from the direction of the Rock Lead. The United Miners have a good quantity of wash-dirt, but of inferior quality. The Cairngorm, at the base of the Green Hill, have not made much progress since the erec tion of their new steam engine, the pumps no answering well upon their first trial. There is an extraordinary amount of water to be over come in the sinking of the shaft. The con sistency of the rock at the depth at which they have now arrived, about 150 feet, does not much differ from that which they have had throughout \u2014 being nothing but scori\u00e6. The workings on Preston's Hills (private property) upholds its fame as one of the best producing in the district. On the Quartz Reef there will be, in a few days, the best crushing apparatus that has yet reached the district. The proprietors of this splendid piece of machinery are Messrs. John ston, Warne, and Rand, of Ballaarat, who are the holders of a lease of 300 yards of the Carngham Reef. Parallel with this reef, and within a short distance, is the Britannia Reef, on which there are several claims being worked, and some prospecting. In connection with the Prospector's Claim on this reef there is a very efficient battery, whilst the claim itself main tains to the present time a distinguished local superiority, \u2014 the prospects, being, as far as I have learned, 17 dwt. to the ton. more forward state were it not for the uncer tainty of their tenure, which was disputed by another party for a long time. The Lucky and Robin Hood (leaseholds) will be bottomed in a short time. The British (lease) have bottomed too shallow : they find the gutter runs between their shaft and Spring Creek ; from the known steepness of the banks of the gutter here they will not have far to drive. The Grand Junction Block Claim is making rapid headway. Along the whole extent of territory from Lucky Woman's to the Grand Trunk Claim, south of the junction of Smythe's and Spring Creeks, the place presents an ani mated appearance. The whole of the claims are under the supervision of good managers, the labor is let by contract, and the greater number of the companies are formed under Limited Liability Acts. The Cleft of the Rock (lease) have got a splentUd prospect. They have now a powerful steam engine nearly erected, the former one being found incapable of answering their requirements. Shares in this company are quoted at \u00a3300. Between this claim and the Try Again (lease) there is a valuable piece of ground which would well pay to sink on it. Its length is about 600 feet. A considerable quantity of hard rock could be also avoided by sinking the shaft in the ravine which separates the two claims. The Try Again Company are sinking in the Devil's Kitchen, having entirely abandoned their tunnel over which they fruitlessly ex pended sixteen months' labor. I have observed great losses accruing to mining companies (the last named may be quoted as an illustration) through the want of having some determinate data for ascertaining or even approximating to the proper depths of the leads where shafts are sunk far in advance of other workings, often without any guide but vague conjecture, in determining the proper depth at which to open out their drives. They generally pay the penalty by finding them selves either too shallow or too deep, and thus an immense amount of labor is lost in an unavailing search, besides, in some instances, the stability of the works being impaired. This evil could be easily obviated by taking levels along the leads from shaft to shaft, and then finding from the relative depths of any two shafts, at a sufficient distance asunder, what is the fall or inclination of that lead for any given distance, and applying that as the ratio of difference to the unworked part of the lead, or where prospecting shafts may be sunk far in advance. If proper sections of these levels were made accessible to the miners in the various locali ties where they may be required I think they would greatly modify, if not entirely remove, what now proves to be an evil of a very Creswick Division.

The total quantity of cement, tailings, Sec, crashed during the month by these companies is thus shown to be 1 885 tons, yielding 369 oz. 8 dwt. 1 lgr , three-fourths of which gold I am satisfied could not be obtained by any other process at present in operation on the gold fields ; another party has taken up a large claim of the abandoned ground on Portuguese Flat, for the purpose of erecting machinery. and passing the refuse stuff through it. The Frenchman's Quartz Mining Company have crushed, from the 22nd December, to the 31st ultimo. 431 tons of quartz, which has yielded 174 oz. 4 dwt., or an average of 8 dwt. 2 gr. per ton. The Original St. George's Company had 5 tons of quartz crushed from some leaders in their claim, which yielded 3 oz. 11 dwt. There is such a rush of water in the old shaft that the company are sinking a new one to strike the reef at a different place, and at a greater depth. The shafts in the different quartz claims at Opossum gully continue to go down; no further trials have been made, but gold is plainly discernible in some of the quartz. The Gum Tree Quartz Mining Company, who took up a quartz claim at the head of Petticoat Gully in August last, have had a trial made from the several depths of 16, 60, and 100 feet, the average yield from which was over 5 dwt. to the ton ; the reef is 16 feet across, being fully wider towards the bottom than at the top ; the company are preparing to erect machinery. I have also to report favorably of the pro gress made at Clunes by the different com panies, in taking means to extend their mining operations; one new engine is in course of erection, and three more are ordered. During the month, though there have been no rich or extraordinary finds, yet there are several indications of improvement in this division both in alluvial and quartz mining. At Ironstone Hill, Slaty Creek, two more parties have bottomed and got payable gold. Woofe and party's shaft is 34 feet deep, through 28 feet of blue rock and 6 feet of clay ; the wash-dirt, which is thin, averaging so far 1 oz. to the tub. Several new claims have been taken up, and from the position of the claims at this place which are getting gold, there seems a likelihood of a run of gold extending into Bullarook. At Bullock Gully a claim has been recently bottomed, and gold found at the point near where the run of gold some years since was lost, or at least beyond which no gold could be found. Present appearances indicate that the gold has not followed the deepest ground, but is either on the reef or in a shallower gutter than the one formerly tried, Four claims are taken up on its supposed course. The Bald Hills Lead still continues to pay well. Two more claims are through the rock, viz., the Independent and Garibaldi Companies. All the miners at Graham's Hill are busy working. Most of the miners at this place keep their earnings secret; still it is evident that the miners at this place arc doing well. near The Port Phillip Company have crushed during the past four weeks 2567 tons of quartz, Description.

The Clunes Alliance Company have their new main shaft down 172 feet, but intend to sink it 320 feet ; it is 7J by 4 feet in the clear. There is 25 feet of water in the shaft, and the company are getting an engine with 10-inch pipes. The Clunes United Company, from their new shaft, have put a cross drive through the Oldman Reef and Robinson's Reef, at a level of 150 feet ; the former is 14 feet in thickness, and the latter, where cut, 10 feet On working the latter lode to the southward it was found to vary to a width of 5 sect and subsequently to 7 feet, and gradually widening. No sepa rate trials of the two reef's were made, but their average yield has been nearly 7 dwt per ton. which yielded 1932 oz. 1 dwt. This company is erecting an assay office nearly adjoining their works ; the building is of brick, and is of a substantial character. The Clunes Quartz Mining Company are simply extending their works by driving on the different levels ; the Welcome Reef looks well, but the stone from it has not been separately tested ; an engine has been purchased of over 45 horse-power, for winding from the northern shaft, which shaft the company intends to sink much deeper. The Yankee have, as usual, crushed about 120 tons, the average yield of which still con tinues to be If oz per ton.

The manager in tends to use the patent safety cage for protec tion against accident in the event of breakage of the winding gear. The new engine is 45 horse-power, has a cylinder of 22 inches, 4 feet stroke ; boiler, 35 feet long and 7 feet in diameter.

The Victoria Company have sunk their shaft 63 feet deeper, the present depth of their shaft being 338 feet. They have opened out a level at this depth, and expect to cut the Eastern Reef in fourteen days : no other work is at present Carried on by this company. The shaft of the New North Clunes (Esmond's) Company is down 70 feet ; the timbering is of the best character ; the dimen sions of the shaft are 14 feet 5 inches by 5 fret in the clear, and is to be divided into three compartments. The size of the timber for the first 100 feet is 3 by 6 inches ; for the second, 3J by 6 inches ; for the third, 4 by 6 inches ; for the fourth, 4J by 6 inches ; for the fifth, 5 by 6 inches ; for the sixth, 5J by 6 inches, with pump bearers 8 by 12 inches every 18 feet to carry the pipes. The shaft will be furnished with a ladder-way from top to bottom, and the whole of the timber is morticed together in a manner that it can be easily drawn, and yet by the method of shouldering the mortices affords the fidl amount of strength the timber is capable of.

The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The value of the machinery is estimated at \u00a319,100, and the steam-power employed about 100 horse. Quartz Reefs \u2014 At Simmon's Reef the operations during January have not been so active as usual, owing, in some instances, to want of sufficient water to work the machinery, and in others by delays caused by effecting new and deeper winnings in the mines. The Imperial Company have just finished a fresh winning, and some of the quartz pro duced therefrom has been crushed, but I regret to say- that the yield of gold realised has fallen far short of what was expected, being no more than barely 4 oz. to the ton of quartz. The Lerderderg Company, who have the largest works here, have been doing very little during the month, beyond fixing a new wind ing engine to raise the quartz to the surface. Their crushing machinery has not been at work for some time, but, I am told, will soon start again. The Simmon's Reef Quartz Mining Com pany are steadily working in the mine, but their crushing machinery is also at a stand, from their being engaged in fixing a steam engine in addition to their water wheel, the engine being intended to drive a newly patented crushing machine, which is expected to be in operation shortly. The Cornish Company's is also stopping from want of water, but the claim is fully at work. Appleton Brothers are the only parties on this reef who have been constantly at work through the month, and doing well. In fact, there has been less done on this reef during the last than during any one month for some time past. Alluvial. \u2014 One party of miners in All Nations Gully have bottomed at 65 feet, and have struck on wash-dirt three feet deep; they do not know the width of it yet, but they are satisfied it will pay them well to put through a horse puddling machine.

Operations were commenced by the contrac tors on the dam for the reservoir for water supply on Monday last, 28th January. Barry's Reef. \u2014 There is only one company at work on this reef (Anderson and Company) who have a water wheel and a battery of four stampers. They have had some crushing during the month, and a yield of gold from 6^ to 7 dwt. to the ton. Generally this is a paying yield where the machinery is good and the quantity large, but in this particular in stance it is not remunerative. I had nearly omitted to mention Hewson's Reef as worked by Hewson and party. I am induced to think this to be a very important reef. The works upon it at present are trifling. and as yet very imperfect, but there is a field here for a strong company, who I think would realize good returns, the woiks being properly opened and organized. The present company are going to add four more stampers to the four already in operation, and their crushings, although on a small scale, have been satisfac tory they say, considering the imperfect state of the works and the smallness of crushing power. The yield has not exceeded 8 dwt. to the ton. Wilson's and Garibaldi Reefs, on the Ballan road. \u2014 The only claim on the former (the prospecting claim) which may, according to appearances, be likely to produce a satisfactory yield, is at a stand pending the decision of a law suit between the parties interested in the claim, which I understand coines on for hear- ing at Ballaarat on the 2nd of February. Most of the other claims on this reef have been abandoned, the holders being disheartened from the quartz that was crushed out of one claim (10 tons) having produced only 5^ oz. gold. Most of them have taken claims on the more recently discovered reef, called the Gari- baldi, and where some of them have very favorable prospects, but at such a distance from a crashing machine (8 miles) the cartage being 25s. per ton, no profit can be expected, the only chance being the erection of ma- chinery on the spot, but which I am afraid the present operators on the mines are not in a position to effect. Pending this I cannot look forward to much good being done in this quarter. Newman's Reef. \u2014 The prospecting claim on this reef is producing well. They have had another crashing at the Imperial Company's machine, and the yield as before was 2 oz of gold to the ton of quartz. The adjoining claims have not yet struck the reef. Johnson's Reef. \u2014 The operations on this reef are now confined to one company \u2014 the Caledonian Company \u2014 they having purchased the interest of the Golden Point Company in the adjoining claim.

Alluvial Diggings. \u2014 These diggings on the whole are on the increase ; there appears to be a growing tendency amongst the diggers to take registered claims, although applications for holding claims in reserve are more frequent from want of water which is beginning to be felt ; some claim holders continue to do well which the recent rains will enable them to do still better.

At Bowman's Forest the Perseverance Lead has not progressed in length ; some of the claims doing very well while the others are uncertain and patchy. The same may be said of the German Lead, which is not extending in length. A new small lead, called the California, running into the German Lead, has been taken up and is being worked, though none of the wash-dirt has as yet been washed in quantity. Several parties are at present prospecting in the small gullies running down into the forest. Upon Reid's Creek and the Woolshed, in consequence of the water becoming so scarce, the wheels cannot in many instances be kept going to drain the ground, many of the claims are therefore lying almost unworked until the wet season sets in again. At the Eldorado, Kneebone's party have shifted their engine to the upper part of their ground, and will immediately set in to sink their fresh shaft. They will be greatly facili- tated in draining their ground by Hitching's party above them who have got some old workings on the upper part of their claim, which became a reservoir for the creek and water-shed above, and the draining of which prevents the lower claims from being over- burdened with water. McEvoy's (or O'Neill's) are doing remark- ably well, their shaft is 220 feet deep, while that of Kneebone's is but sixty-two feet ; the wash-dirt of the latter being 3 by 6 feet, and that of the former 12 by 15 feet. In the next claim of Kenyon's they have driven at right angles to the run of the creek some 120 yards, having crossed a small but rich lead of eight feet wide ; this is evidently not the main lead. At present they are continuing this lead down. In the next claim below of Wellington's they sank a shaft in the centre or rather to the right of the low flat in which the creek runs and bottomed on granite at 84 feet. They are sinking a fresh shaft 90 yards to the left, they have gone down 130 feet and expect to have to go another 100 feet before they bottom. Below this claim two amalgamated leases of fifty acres each are being applied for by Messrs. Whittington and Martin, and Messrs. Bailey and Attenborough. It is a matter of surprise that more leases are not applied for as they give a much greater security to the land, and employers are not at the mercy and caprice of their men. In a few days I will forward a plan of these diggings. Yackandandah and Nine-mile Divisions. (Thomas G. Kennan, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Nothing of importance in alluvial mining has taken place during the month. Miners in both divisions have in general been fully employed, although some parties begin to complain of a scarcity of water for sluicing operations. This complaint is most prevalent in the Nine-mile Division, and the result is an increase to the number of our puddling mills of one in working order and two more in course of erection. A great saving of water is effected by the use of these mills, but they cannot in point of efficiency, saving of labor, or amount of work done, be compared with the system of sluice washing. No party in these districts having a sufficiency of water, unless in excep- tional cases, would ever think of giving up their sluice to take to puddling. In quartz mining I have to report the dis- covery of two new reefs, or rather one new one and the reopening of another. The one re- opened being named the Southern Cross, the newly discovered one the Star of the East. Four tons from the former have been sent to Chiltern to be crushed, but no returns have as yet been received.

From enquiries I find that the two quartz crushing machines have only had 120 tons this month, which averaged about one ounce per ton. Several other leaders have been found with favorable prospects m the district of VVahgunyah. During the month a reaction has taken place on the old leads here by the ground being retaken up, principally upon the Durham, De vonshire. Lanarkshire, and Old Indigo Leads. Several small spurs or leaders have been found adjoining the Old Indigo Main Lead and Durham. The Chiltern Lead is also looking up. I am sorry to say that the Wahgunyah Leads have not turned out as yet as was first expected from the reports made by the various prospectors on the different leads. They have, on the whole, not averaged more than one ounce per load (of thirty oil or tin cans) with about 15 inches in thickness of wash-dirt, though they are (the leads) very patchy, and do in some cases give about from I to 10 dwt to the tin dish prospects. It has caused the district to be at present very unsettled, and particularly with a new diggings being found in New South Wales, about four miles to the north-east of Wah gunyah township (Mr. Eoord's pre-emptive property) called Corawa. It, from enquiries, is averaging (from two shafts bottomed in two gullies) about from 10 to 30 dwt. to the cart load, though I believe several other gullies are likely soon to get on leads from the appear ance of the country. The greatest difficulty that is felt in this dis trict is want of water, there being no streams, &e., in the immediate district to supply the diggers, no rain having fallen for several months of any consequence. Some plans ofthe Wahgunyah diggings will be forwarded as soon as possible. the ton; the other parcel from shaft No. 4 (vide plan forwarded last month) yielded 4 oz. to the ton. On all our reefs, numbering at present seven, miners seem full of confidence, particularly as they have now a prospect of getting their stone crushed ; an enterprising party in the district having commenced placing an engine and crushing apparatus in the immediate vicitnity of Henderson's Reef, and I have no doubt that after a few crushings we will not want for an ample supply of powerful machinery. A report has reached me of a new discovery of payable gold on theCobunga Creek, situated iu the Omeo Division. The news brought in by the leader of one of the Government pros pecting parties sent from here, wdio is prospect ing within six miles of this locality ; he states that it will pay thirty shillings per day. Not being in my division, and the great distance (over sixty miles) has deterred me from visiting the place. Indigo Division. (Thomas E. Thornely, Mining Surveyor.)

The above new quartz veins are not as yet of any very material importance being for the most part only small veins such as abound in all the ranges in this district. There has also been a prospecting claim registered on a very large reef formerly named the Leviathan, and which is situated between the Pioneer and White Star Reefs. It is now named the Last Chance Reef. The prospectors, who are a party likely to give it a good trial, have succeeded in obtaining gold in the stone which is of a fine looking quality ; the reef is conveniently situated near to abundant water- power, so that as the reef is very large a small yield would pay handsomely. On the Oriental Reef, Messrs. Cotsworth and Company, No. 1 South, are now raising some very fine stone. This claim continues to improve greatly as the workings extend in depth. The other claims from which quartz has been crushed also show an improvement in the yield. Messrs. WaUace and Company, have again commenced prospecting for the reef on claim No. 1 , North. On Mead's Reef, a quantity of surface quartz has been crushed, yielding 1 oz. 5 dwt. per ton, but the prospectors have not yet succeeded in obtaining a payable reef at any great depth. On Gander's Reef sinking has been entirely suspended until an engine for pumping the claims out, and now in course of erection, is completed. In consequence of this delay Gitchell and Company's large machine has been idle all the month. On the Elgin Reef Stephens and Company have again commenced prospecting for the second reef, and so also have Falkner's party in the prospecting claim. On the Reliance the prospectors are raising some of the finest stone that I have seen in the district, and which they expect will exceed in value that previously crushed by them. Two other claims are also prospecting for the reef. On Richardson's the prospectors are con tinuing to raise first-rate quartz from their claim, especially from the southern part of their workings, which have now reached a depth of 112 feet. In No. 1 North but little work has been done ; so little quartz has been raised that the yield of 1 oz. per ton has not paid ; probably, however, as the workings deepen, the reef will widen out, as in Richardson's claim. No. 1 South, for a long time abandoned, has again been taken up by a party who are sinking for the reef. Crushing will commence this week on the Hit or Miss, and the Rose, Thistle, and Sham- Note. \u2014 The above returns are made from personal observation, the registration of claims, and from the last police reports. The aggregate value of the mining plant in the Bucklank division is \u00a326,720. There is no material change in the aspect of mining affairs in this division since my last report. Sluicing claims in the Buckland and Ovens River districts continue to yield fair returns, and I have observed that on Morse's Creek and at Harrietville (Ovens River) several claims are payine- remarkably well. At the latter place a considerable number of Chinese are located, and are making very good wages. On the Nelson Reef. Buckland, Messrs. Tracy and Co. have at last commenced crush- ing, but the yield of their quartz has fallen far below that expected, judging from its appear- ance before going through the mill. I believe that much gold has been lost in consequence of the presence of a large quantity of mundic in the stone, which impairs the action of the quicksilver and amalgamated copper plates. Murray's Reef, lately discovered on the Buck- land, is likely to turn out well. It is at present about four feet wide, with gold risible through- out. There is no other claim but the pro- spector's working, as the reef cannot be traced beyond their boundaries. A quantity of the quartz will be crushed at Morse's Creek, in a few days. The only other reef occupied on the Buck land, is the one on Maguire's Flat, and of this there is no report to make at present. In the Ovens River, and Morse's Creek portions of the division, there have been five prospectors' claims registered on newly dis covered reefs during January, and they are named and situated as follows, viz: \u2014 The Nip-up Reef, near the Hit or Miss, Ovens River ; the Canadian, near Falkner's.

They are looking well and are expected to turn out highly remunerative. The quartz from the Woolshed Reef is not yielding so well as was expected : some of the quartz is rich, but being mixed indiscriminately with other stone, nearly non-auriferous, has caused the yield to be much less than it need necessarily have been. No. 2 is a longitudinal section of Ihe work ings ; A, B, C, and D, are ihe shafts ; the numbers from 1 to 14 show the galleries, all of which are stowed with mullock ; the floors of these galleries are six feet apart, and are formed of slabs laid across the props, as shown by the letters a, a, a. &c. ; E is a level which has been driven nearly to the N W. boundary of the claim, but the quartz in this direction being rather poor is not being worked upon at present ; letter F shows another level which has been driven from No. 4 shaft to the S E. strike of the reef ; the vein at this part of the claim is very narrow, but widens out in the lower levels, below galleries 13 and 14. The best quartz in this claim appears to lie in a direction parallel to the S.E. strike of the reef, commencing from No. 2 shaft ; the shafts are, with the exception of part of No. 4, closely timbered all round, and shaft No. 2 is provided with ladders The prospecting claim on Falkner's Reef (Ovens River), is improving, a parcel of 15 tons, not picked, having yielded 3 oz. 12 dwt. per ton. Several other crushings from small reefs in the district show this month an improvement in the returns The Lisbon Reef has been abandoned as not payable. The following is a tabular statement of the crushings, and yield of the quartz crushed during January : \u2014 The claim is worked in short levels or slopes, partly in the sandstone which, when mined, is stowed in the galleries.

Stafford Reef. \u2014 Heine and Company from this line obtained some very fine stone last week, below water level ; I believe they have a large body of the same sort. Best and Com- pany to the north struck the rich vein again last week, a few tons of which turned out of the retort a very fine cake of gold. Several claims to lhe north and south are persevering, but have not yet struck the lead. Sheep's Bead Reef is looking pretty brisk ; about six claims together are getting stone more or less payable. This is a very steady line, but not so rich as many others have proved to be. New Chum Reef. \u2014This line, with the excep- tion of Gibbs and Lazarus's claim, is quite at a standstill. The New Chum Company are not at work, and thereby the water has risen and flooded all the claims again north and south. Victoria Reef is, perhaps, not so briskly at work as I have seen it. Ballerstedt is raising stone from the back of his house, but not very rich ; to the north of this they are all, more or less, at work upon the same stone. The Her- cules Company are still raising and crushing from their large reef ; their last weekly returns were very fair. Tyson's Reef. \u2014 The company are still crush- ing from the reef, which appears to thicken as it deepens, a sure sign of its lasting. A frivo- lous panic was caused by a vivid report of a large encroachment having been made upon the claim to the north, and from whence all the gold was obtained ; this caused one or two to sell out, which for a time depressed the com- pany's prospects, apparently to the eyes of the public, and prevented the shares from rising even to their real value. Engisch and Myers are upon the same stone, but not so rich as the company have it. Kershaw and Company, Perseverance Reef, have had another good crushing last week from the same small spur from whence now ahout 1000 oz. have been taken within the last three months ; the spur crops out north of the gully, and dips to the south Kershaw and Company have also a large reef below water level they are certain will yield 4 oz. per ton. having tested it so far without the aid of winding gear beyond the common windlass. I should say that seventy out of the hundred of quartz claims in this district are standing idle. Upon the lines where there is pumping machi nery at work some bustle and life is visible, but upon those where there is none, the lines from north to south appear to be quite abandoned, most of the claims having been thoroughly The alluvial miners are industriously perse vering. There are ver}- few of the good mills but what are at work, and the last fall of rain gave them an abundance of water. There has been a rash this month to the Lower Sheep Wash Creek, about six miles from Sandhurst, caused by some parties report ing a gold field and claiming a prospecting claim, but unfortunately it proved a failure; some 900 people (all miners) went to the spot, nearly the whole of whom retdrned next day. A few however remained and are following up the lead, which is only it appears 3 feet wide with only about 6 inches of auriferous drift. The greatest depth of the lead as yet is 6 feet. Quartz mining is still very dull in my sub division; but I am happy to say that I can perceive a gradual change and steady improve ment within the last month, which seems to be general throughout the entire district. Some very heavy finds in the quartz have taken place this last week or two, at greater depths than has hitherto been attained. Glasgow Reef. \u2014 There is another crushing machine going up on this line in the claim of Messrs. Hunt, Kater, and Company, to the north. They have a large body of stone yield ing 10 dwt. per ton. The Glasgow Reef United Company are now working a good payable body of stone, and the two claims to the north are upon the same lode ; it is apparently a connecting link of the two limbs of the reef, commencing very thin and lying close against the west limb, at thirty feet, gradually departing from the reef, and inclining eastward, and thickening as it deepens. At seventy feet it was five feet thick, yielding one and a half oz per ton. The pump shaft is still being deepened; 200 feet is the depth required ; the difficulties in the way are so great that it is barely possible to continue. The stratum, 100 feet of which they have gone already through, is a deep blue and very tough basalt rock, very fine in the Description. No. Horse- power.

I have the honor to submit the accompany ing plans and sections of one of our most important quartz workings, both as regards the amount of work done and the effective way in which the various reefs have been opened up. worked and prospected to the water. I know that if we had about four times the quantity of pumping engines well placed upon the various lines, with a good drainage law to suit the poor miner as well as the rich, we should be able to send down 20,000 oz, weekly, in stead of one-fourth that quantity, as at present.

The principal reef hitherto worked is the Redan. through which the main or engine shaft has been sunk to a depth of 303 feet, which depth is daily increasing, it being the intention of the proprietors (Messrs Cooper and Company) to prosecute another level at about 360 feet This shaft intersects the Redan at 210 feet from the surface, and permanent levels have been driven in various directions the bearings and lengths of which are indicated on the plan. The population is as follows : \u2014 The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Sheet No. 2. \u2014 Gives a transverse section passing through the shaft, but having for the sake of perspicuity the different adits reduced to the same plane.

These sections are in a plane making nearly an angle of 33 degrees with the perpendicular, or the angle of the underlie of the reefs. The first permanent level is at a depth of 90 feet; the reef here is about 3 ft. 6 in. in thick ness. The second permanent level is at a depth of 163 feet. Sheet No. 3 shows where the auriferous lode has been removed. The third level is at a depth of 210 feet; at this level the main shaft intersects the Redan Reef. Between this and the second gallery the quartz has been mostly extracted, the quantity in rough numbers being 52,000 cubic feet. In the alluvial mining, except in the case of puddling mills. I cannot find that any per ceptible alteration has taken place during the last month. The want of water in some of the outlying gullies has caused some of the mills to stop, but I believe, as soon as that want is supplied that they will resume their work. Four new mills have been added to the number since my last report. Between the third and the fourth levels, which last is at a depth of 269 feet, only sufficient of the reef has been taken out to form a gallery, and on both the second and third levels to the east, transverse adits have been prosecuted through the rock (sandstone), cutting the maiden reef at a distance of 169 and 188 feet from the shaft respectively. At both these levels the maiden reef has been partially worked. As between the second and third levels the whole of the lode has been removed, and the space filled up with the debris of the workings ; as the work proceeded upwards evidently the best method for economising In the quartz nothing of importance has occurred, the reefs in general continuing to yield about the usual amount of gold, nor is \"there likely to be much improvement until the reefs are cleared of water, and this cannot be Iccupal tion. luropeans. lese. illuvial miners 3,700 400 [uartz miners 1,100 4,800 400 Description.

These timbers are very strong and rendered quite safe by their con struction (shown on plan No. 2). The timber ing is periodically inspected by competent persons. Hell's Hole. \u2014 These diggings are situate about nine miles, in a straight line, north-easterly from Merton (Big Hill), and comprise work ings on three different creeks, viz., Hell's Hole, Dry and Branket Creeks, all of which rise on the Blue Range, on the boundary of Kellsall's station. Hell's Hole Creek is now worked for about four miles downwards from its source; but, with the exception of one party, who have just set in, it is at present entirely deserted. The diggings here, as well as on the two other creeks, is confined to the creek and its banks. The bed rock here is slate This creek joins the Glen Creek at the Junction Station. The next creek in a westerly direction from the last mentioned one is the Dry Creek, which has been worked from its source to its junction with Hell's Hole Creek, a distance of about two and a half miles. The gold here, which is but very slightly waterworn. is found chiefly in the gravel overlying the rock in the creek, a hard slate, having a north-easterly strike ; the average depth from the black soil on the surface to the rock in the creek is about 10 feet ; in some places clay intervenes between the black loom and the gravel. At the northern end is situated another principal shaft termed the donkey engine shaft ; it has been sunk to a depth of 185 feet. At 123 feet adits have been driven east and west, cutting the black reef at a distance of 59 feet from the shaft; here a gallery (GH) of 80 feet long has been driven, following the course of the reef. In the eastern adit the white reef has been cut at a distance of 46 feet from the shaft; the worked portion (C.D.) is 105 feet in length by about 30 feet in height and 2 feet in thickness. At a distance of about 90 feet from the white reef the Redan has again been cut through, and the adit carried on 9 0 feet further west. The shaft marked No. 3 on sheet No. 1 has been lately sunk for the purpose of prospecting the western reefs. At 50 feet deep the Redan was cut, at which depth a drive of 90 feet has been prosecuted westerly; it has cut two other reefs, supposed to be the east and west Hustlers It is still to be continued to the west. The Dry Creek Sluicing Company, which is the only party working here on anything like a large scale, have brought in their water from the Branket Creek, a distance round the bends of the race of over three miles, an undertaking which has fully occupied six men for eight months. This race has a fall of four inches to the chain, and is brought to the summit of a headland, fully 150 feet above the bed of the Dry Creek, and commanding almost any por tion of it for sluicing purposes. A solid granite rock has in many instances been cut through, besides which there is a considerable length of fluming. Kilmore Division. (F. M.

Glen Creeks has been worked to some small extent ; the strike of the reef is nearly north and south, with a very considerable underlie to the west. No crushing has yet been had from this reef, as the nearest machine is at Muddy Creek (Yea), a distance of more than 40 miles. The reef, as far as it has been fol lowed down, will average at least 2 feet in thickness; at a depth of about 23 feet I broke some stone from the reef, and found fine gold through it, as well as in almost every stone that I found raised on the surface ; I should estimate its probable yield at from i to f oz. per ton, a return which woidd prove remunera tive, could a water-power crushing machine be erected near the reef.

Lamplough, and all the other sections of my division (in consequence of this rush), are now quite denuded of their European alluvial mining population. Section 6 is situate upon the same run of gold, but nearly at a right angle from the former working, being a continuation into shallow ground, approaching near the boundary line between this division and St. Arnaud; the sinking is 25 feet deep, of the same des cription (except the false bottom) as the previous section, yielding 1 oz. to the load, with 9 inches of wash-dirt; these workings from section 3 to section 6 inclusive, although yet a considerable distance apart are expected at no distant period to converge, but as several holes lower down on each working have struck water, at depths varying from 55 to 70 feet, and at the same time have seen gold in the drift, consequently with engine machinery to properly develope its resources, this side of the ranges from its natural facilities will unquestionably become the most extensive and permanent portion of these workings. I beg to forward a plan of all these work ings, connecting each, by actual survey, with McKinnon's pre-emptive section. A portion of these workings, I find, called Hind's Diggings, situate near the home station, are on the St. Arnaud side of the present boundary line, consequently out of my division. Vertical sections of the sinking at each of these workings, (see plan), I beg briefly to enunciate. Commencing at section 1 , situate at the first diggings opened on Mountain Creek ; the sinking is 12 feet deep, principally through brown gravel, the bed rock being mica schist ; from this claim very little fine gold has yet been taken, but several nuggets varying in weight, the largest I saw, weighing 86 oz. 1 4 dwt. ; the gold is of a very ragged des cription on the outside, neither is any of it yet found on this side of the ranges at all waterworn. Sections 7 and 8, called Hind's Diggings, (see plan), being on the St Arnaud side of the boundary line, therefore will only state that the depth of sinking varies from 30 to 60 feet, with 2 feet of wash-dirt, yielding 7 dwt. to the load. Section 2, is a continuation of the same workings, but payable only in patches and situate on the south side of the principal street, when the lead crosses and continues into deeper ground ; the sinking is 32 feet deep, of the former description, with a similar bottom, the wash-dirt yielding half an-ounce to the load, with 2 feet thickness; other workings in close proximity are 10 and 15 feet deeper than this, with more thickness of auriferous drift, yielding on the average about the same quantity of gold per load; the entire length of these workings at present is 115 chains by an average width of 5 chains.

The population of the Korong division has still further decreased during this month, arising principally from the reports brought from Mountain Creek. A great many of the miners who have left this place have registered their claims, to remain unworked for a period of three months, in order that they may return at the end of that period and retake possession. The reason given for registration being in almost every instance, having worked over three months without obtaining payable gold. I hope to be able to take a few more trans verse sections in the course of next month, when I will prepare horizontal sections of the workings at different levels, and a plan of the surface.

Hall's rush has been very much depopulated during the last month, as will be seen by annexed returns ; the gold found here is ex tracted by the crushing machine at Old Kingower, being mostly found in a hard cement. On Daly's Frontage Lead the shareholders have not as yet erected machinery, although from a sample of the gold taken from one of the claims, which bottomed on the reef, these men are very sanguine and are stirring them selves actively in the matter. Korong. \u2014 The quartz reefs here do not wear any more encouraging aspect than they did at the time of my last report.

My remarks on quartz crashing machinery in my report for December. 1860. will also be applicable for this month with this exception, the mills then in course of erection are now completed and at work with the exception of one. The alluvial miners working at the Wool shed Flat have considerably decreased, and now number only between 200 and 300.

The prospect obtained was out of three loads of stuff. 4J oz. of gold ; the gold is found in a layer of cement, on sandstone. There is every probability that this discovery will be the means of recovering the old deep lead which was lost about six weeks ago.

Being the extreme north of the Pyrenees proper, and a fine auriferous alluvial country on each side, the ranges compos, d of quartz and schist, I think it as fine a piece of untried country as the prospector could seek. Near to Sanderson's some Italians have heen steadily at\" work for two years, and I am in formed have lately washed a prospect from new ground of 2 oz. to the load. At St. Arnaud I have scarcely anything new to report except steady and energetic progress, especially among the quartz mining community, although to judge from the sluggish dulness of the crushing machines one would almost imagine both crushers and miners were asleep. It is only on visiting the reefs themselves one can see the prospect looming ahead. Several new reefs have this month been opened and all with a very fair show, although not grand, yet payable. On the older reefs things are still dull, except at Wilson's Hill, Chrysolite Hill, and Sebastopol, where either machinery is being erected or preparations made for the erection thereof. On Wilson's Hill the St. Arnaud United Company are having a large dam erected and reservoir excavated, the cutting and filling in of puddled wall being completed 275 feet in length and 18 inches in the bed rock, and at the deepest point 13 feet in height. Tenders are out for sinking the main shaft, and the timber for same is on the ground, making this portion of the place look like business. Messrs. Grierson and Company are also erecting machinery on the Chrysolite Hill, and have applied for a lease of the same. At the Sebastopol lease Messrs. Cameron and Company are sinking their main shaft about 200 feet to the north of their 1 00 feet shalt. From recent trials of quartz taken as blown out, a fair average may be drawn of 1 2 or 1 3 dwt. per ton. The lode on surface varying from 4 to 6 feet thick, and from its appearance in the other shaft there is every probability of its being 12 or 14 feet thick. At the Erwan's, Bald Hill, &c, a few alluvial miners are still at work, the ground being in general poor and patchy. The inducement to stay is not sufficient, when contrasted with the glowing accounts from the south-west portion of this district. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 Price of crushing from 15s. to \u00a31 10s. per ton. At Messrs. Wright and Company's machine they have adopted an easy contrivance for getting rid of the tailings. It consists of a long vertical pipe in which moves an endless chain with pistons of round sheet iron fixed about 1 8 inches apart; being worked from the engine, it continually raises the tailings and water to a sufficient elevation to allow of its flowing clear of everything. A slight increase in the number of miners has taken place during the last month in this division ; owing to the large rush at McKin non's, Mountain Creek, New Tear's Flat, &c, having brought hundreds of alluvial miners close on the edge of this division, numbers of whom not finding profitable employment at the rushes, have scattered themselves in and about the surrounding gullies at and near Mr. Hines's station, where I think with a little energy they cannot fail to discover some other payable locality. I last week visited the rush at New Year's Flat, Mountain Creek. &c., and also that close to Mr. Hines's paddock, and from the similar appearance of the country, imagined the latter to be equally as auriferous ; the alluvial at Mr. Hines's is not veiy rich, J oz, to the load being the best, but when taken into considera tion that to obtain a load of wash-dirt nearly two loads has to be raised, two-thirds of it con sisting of quartz boulders, it cannot pay very good wages. In one claim I visited the wash dirt was 1 8 inches thick and the gold jet black. On the shallower ground in claims adjoining the gold was quite bright. From what I saw of the alluvial and the time I spent in the ranges I do not think the country between Hines's and Sanderson's would support any number of alluvial miners.

This is the best sign of this population being settled, nearly all the old quartz miners being able to enjoy a quiet and happy Sunday among their fellow laborers, and their crops of fruit or stacks of hay. private companies are obtaining better yields, the most encouraging feature being proofs of rich quartz in depth, that is, depth for this division, where mining has scarcely been at tempted away from daylight, and where very few claims have been proved below low water level but where so worked (about 160 feet), the auriferous character of the quartz bears out experience gained on other gold fields further advanced than ourselves. I believe it to be the intention of some of our quartz miners to send about half a ton of quartz containing silver to Mr. Wilkinson for trial, as he has offered to operate on a small quantity, if sent. New Workings. \u2014 The rush, of which I re ported a commencement last month, on ground known as Taylor's paddock, has increased to rather gigantic proportions ; the whole of this lower portion of Campbell's Creek, or Strath loddon, presenting a very animated appearance. Of the immense number of Chinese there con gregated, many are doing exceedingly well, and as is usual with them, the stores, gambling houses, theatres, &c, are well patronized by them. But not only Taylor's paddock but the private property beyond, towards and along the Loddon, is being mined for gold ; and a quantity of table land lately divided into allotments, and sold by Messrs. Mein and Harker, is being tunnelled on all sides ; prospects of 6 dwt. per load being already obtained, with every indication of improvement, proving the oft expressed opinion that this locality would prove a great gold field, its being alienated, doubtless, having prevented its further development. CASTLEMAINE MINING DISTRICT. Castlemaine District. (Thomas Lawrence Brown, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 Machinery. \u2014 A new process for reducing quartz has been patented by Mr. F. O. Cam ront, of Castlemaine, which, if as efficient as represented, will prove invaluable to the quartz miners, as it is said to combine efficiency with rapidity, at a comparatively small cost of construction. The machinery is as follows .* \u2014 The principle is described by the patentee to consist in the simple action of two conical dises, with corrugations, set face to face at an angle of 85 degrees, but revolving in the same direction, each on its own axis. '1 he dises are drawn from the same shaft by a spur wheel and pinion, at a speed of 300 revolutions per minute, by the aid of a 5 horse-power engine, and these being enclosed by a casing, the quartz, cement, or other mineral passed into the machine, cannot leave it until completely pulverised. The entire machine is fitted to a cast iron foundation plate, occupying the small space of 4 feet square, so that it is capable of being placed in a dray complete, and imme diately conveyed to any locality desired. Amongst the advantages claimed for it are the following : \u2014 Its capability to reduce quartz to the finest powder, the rapidity with which it is reduced, its portable character, its cheap ness. The patentee guarantees that the machine will crush at least 100 tons per day, the calcu lation being based upon the actual perform ance of a working model. The metal is crushed in a dry state entirely, without the use I have the honor to report that mining pros pects have considerably improved with the opening of the new year\u2014 new energy seems to have inspired our miners.

The simplicity of its action would lead to the conclusion that the wear and tear would rot be great, the quartz being literally crushed (not ground) by a steady and irre sistible pressure.

The latter is accounted for through the want of water being partially felt, and in a few instances through the entire working out of claims, and the consequent stoppage of machinery. Taradale Division. (Thomas Turner, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Alluvial Mining. \u2014 I have, \"during the last month surveyed five frontage claims on various hills in the parish of Holcombe, on the right bank of the River Loddon \u2014 the new hills I mentioned in my last report, viz., Heron's, Pyke's, and York Hills, in neither of which, however, have the owners of tunnels driven a sufficient distance to reach the various leads, so that it is impossible to predict the result. On Table Hill mining is as brisk as ever, and several parties of miners are realizing small fortunes. To give you an idea of the value of some of the claims on this hill, I may mention that a fourteenth share in one of the tunnels (Harle and Company,) was transferred for the sum of \u00a3320 sterling, and the amount paid in gold produced from the claim. There are several claims on the hill supposed to be richer than this, but the above trausaction was closed in my presence. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The puddlers, as a whole, are working with their usual steadiness and perseverance, some of whom are in many-times worked ground, and are realizing handsome returns. The majority arc earning good wages. Quartz Mining. \u2014 Quartz mining operations are brisk, but I know of no fresh discovery of importance. Two new reefs have been opened during the month, viz., McFarland's Reef, near the Bald Hill, producing 12 dwt., to the ton, and Hit-or-Miss Reef, near the Hamlet of Vaughan, also producing 12 dwt. to the ton. No further crushing from the Liverpool Reef. Mining Companies. \u2014 The only public com panies now in existence in this district are the Eldorado, Ferron's Beef, and the Vaughan Company. The Eldorado is working, but with what results I am unable to ascertain : the same may be said of the Ferron's Reef. The Vaughan Mining Company is still progressing very favorably, and one of the directors informs me that a dividend wdl be declared during the present week.

Sluicing. \u2014 This mode of mining has been vigorously pursued of late on the Coliban River north of Taradale ; and a new privilege has been taken up this month about two miles north of the township. The Vaughan Crushing Company (private) have commenced operations, and satisfactory results have been obtained. The results, however, have been different ; some parties being dissatisfied with the returns, and unfortunately for all, disastrous floods which occurred on the 31st ultimo, put a stop The Kangaroo Crashing Company (private) will commence in about a week ; favorable results are expected. c Occupation.

Formerly it was very productive, yielding once as high a rate as 40 oz. per ton of picked stone, but lately it has only given about 7 dwt. ; the lode increased in thickness as the workmen descended, and now measures twenty-six feet at a depth of 220. to all the operations, and did much damage to the various dams. An application has been put in for an acre of ground at the mouth of Victoria Gully, part being old worked ground, and other part new surfacing at the side of the gully ; the appli cants purpose putting up a horse puddling machine to wash the soil. A party of twelve miners are making pre parations to empty a waterhole in the bed of the Coliban, some six miles northward of Taradale. Having scooped up some of the bottom to test it, they found good indi cations of richness. The place being private property, they have made arrangements with the proprietors, and obtained permission to work it. Maldon Division. (Robert Nankivell, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 With respect to the other branches of alluvial mining, nothing of interest has trans pired of late. The tub and cradle workers are much scattered over the various old worked grounds. The prospecting parties searching for new gold fields under the patronage of the Pros pecting Association, have not discovered any auriferous deposits of sufficient value to engage the attention of the miners, but the trials have been sufficient to prove the existence of the precious metal over a wide area. I have seen so many instances of places having been tried twice, and even thrice before gold was struck in paying quantities, that I think there is still much room for hope. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Quartz Mining. \u2014 Two new reefs have been struck in that attractive field to quartz miners situate eastward of Taradale. One, named the Bonaria, is half a mile northward of Victoria Reef, the other is half a mile west ward of the Victoria, being half way between it and the township, and is known as Danker's Reef. There are now five distinct auriferous reefs discovered within an area of three-quarters of a mile square, all of them striking in different directions, although the three last discovered have not yet been sufficiently traced out to enable one to ascertain the exact compass bearings, or any further particulars. The number of distinct reefs auriferous is 41. known to be The Prince of Wales Company, who are the proprietors of the mine on Hughes's Reef. situate immediately north of the township of Taradale, and whose works have been idle for the last two months, have applied for a lease of seven acres of the ground upon which their works stand, purposing to resume the opera tions with increased appliances. In reference to the total number of persons of all classes, I beg to state that from the time which has elapsed since I received my instruc tions, it has been impossible for me to ascertain the number, or any approximation thereto, as also the number of square miles of auriferous ground actually worked upon. The above statistics have been obtained from personal observation and reference to documents in my possession Further research in this quarter will be very interesting, as Hughes's Reef is the largest Occupation.

Hepburn Division. (Amb. Johnson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows:\u2014 One great obstacle to the working of deep reefs by individual enterprise is the influx of water, but this is being overcome by the formation of companies. When the said companies are formed for the purpose of systematic working they will doubtless be ultimately successful, but I regret to observe that the system of stock-jobbing as at pre sent practised will very much retard quartz mining in this and other districts, As the mining is confined chiefly to quartz reefing the population is a settled one, and is steadily on the increase. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The South Eaglehawk Company, in opening up the reef near the surface, came upon some very rich stones yesterday ; this company's ground includes some of the richest claims in time past on Tarrangower, a plan and sections of which I will forward with my next report. The Beehive Company's yields have fallen off of late, but within the last week it has again struck upon some rich ground at the depth of 130 feet. Linscot's Reef Company is, at a depth of 250 feet, yielding at the ratio of 4 oz. to the ton ; this company has been but recently formed, and is now erecting a steam engine of twenty-five horse-power for crushing, together with a smaller one for the purpose of pumping, hauling, &c. * Two engines arrived on the ground, for immediate erection. The mining population has not during the past month been visibly affected, the water supply having in a great measure kept the sluices busy, and although several new rushes have taken places, still the extent of ground opened has not been such as to cause an influx of miners from the neighbouring gold fields. The Eaglehawk Union Company finding its plant inefficient has ceased crushing, in order to erect a new battery of stampers. Working is still being continued below, and excellent prospects have this week been obtained. In machinery there has been an increase of two engines, just arrived on the ground, and I am informed that two more have been purchased for the same locality\u2014 the lower Yandoit Plains\u2014 the ground having proved too wet to be worked by ordinary means. The Parkins Reef Association are making preparations for working systematically, their machinery is in course of erection, and a con tract has been let for sinking an engine shaft to a depth of 200 feet. In quartz mining I have no news of im portance to report. The Perseverance Quartz Mining Associa tion have suspended operations for the present. Although excellent prospects have been ob tained from the reef, it is found that the present process of amalgamation is inefficient from the peculiar nature of the quartz. Samples of the tailings have been forwarded to Mel bourne for analysis, but the result is not yet In the southern part of the division, Jim Crow Proper, affairs are steadily progressing, but on several reefs lately prospected, ma chinery on the ground has been proved neces sary to make the working profitable, and a number of claims are therefore temporarily at a standstill pending the necessary arrangements being made. known.

The Dry Diggings Company on Parker's Specimen Reef, are just completing their arrangements and have made application for a mining lease of their ground hitherto held under Miners' Rights. I am gratified to see this company again going ahead after their long lethargy, as the reef has been one of the first worked and richest reefs in the district, and by all that has as yet been seen of it, will amply repay for the outlay in machinery. On Wombat Reef the Cornish party is still crushing with good results, about 174 oz. being lately obtained as the fruit of less than three weeks' labor. On the same reef Messrs. Spence and Company are engaged puddling the surface soil and debris from the old shafts on their claims, and the same is the case on Messrs. Clarke and Company's (late Addis and Company's) claim. On Collier's Reef, Messrs Sampson and Com pany have at a depth of over 100 feet, by the influx of water, been compelled to suspend operations, and some of the party have gone to Ballaarat to procure the aid of machinery. In Yandoit matters have, as far as regards quartz mining, been unusually dull. A large number of persons prospecting for quartz having attained the water level, and either not having the means or not seeing sufficient in ducement to erect machinery, having joined alluvial rashes near the northern boundary of the division, and hence the quartz reefs lately so animated, have during this last month ap peared almost deserted. On Melvin's Reef the yield has lately im proved, about 1 \u00a3 oz. per ton, by a width of from 2 to 5 feet of reef, having been the average during the month. The claimholders on both Emeu and Adam's Reefs, are, I believe, in treaty with parties for the introduction of machinery ; the reefs having, years ago, been worked down to the water level, and the quartz left above being too poor to be advantageously worked, wiien cartage for a distance of seven or eight miles over very difficult roads has first got to be defrayed. On Hoggett's Reef, the only party hitherto having obtained gold, have now nearly worked out the reef above water level, and are con templating amalgamating their claim with Messrs. Johnson and Company's, south, who have also struck water, and intend erecting machinery. On Old German Reef Messrs. Rankin and Company and Messrs. Hutton and Company have amalgamated under the firm of the Rots childt Company, and are also making arrange ments for the erection of machinery; and the Goldsmith's Company on the same reef, having applied for a mining lease of their ground, have nearly got their engine ready for starting. On St. George's Reef the Cornish party has erected a whim, and cart the stone to their own machine on the. Wombat Reef. The quartz is poor but still the superior method of w-orking of this company, enables them to net a tolerably good profit. On Purvis Reef a fresh party has lately set in, intending to prospect the reef at a greater depth than heretofore, and if any prospects at all are obtained, powerful machinery will at once be erected. The last crushing from the prospecting claim on Trogish's Reef produced only 9 J oz, from 17 tons of quartz, and the party intends regis tering for a time at least The rest of claims are already for some time registered, several shafts of 100 feet and upwards not having obtained any prospect. On Mauritzian's Reef, Messrs. Harris and Company are still persevering, merely clearing their expenses as they go on, but still they have a high opinion of ultimate success, and about 700 feet adjoining have lately been taken up by a large company. On Glamorganshire Reef very payable stone is now and again being crushed, but the nature of the reef has hitherto been very patchy, and hence it has shared fate with most of the other reefs in Yandoit ; parties having expended three or four months' labor without arriving at any decisive result, having registered and in the meantime trying their luck elsewhere. On the Welcome Reef, Connell's Gully, both Willard and Company and the Pioneer Com pany have during the last month been at a standstill, the last named company having only crushed 8 tons lest on the top \"from last year's working. On Hamburg Reef the prospecting claim is looking well ; but Messrs. Ritters and Com pany's claim adjoining south has not lately shown as well as formerly, but there can be little doubt that the run of gold will again be found as good as usual. On New Nuggety Reef, also at Connell's Gully, the prospecting claim is still paying very well, but the quartz above water will soon be worked out and bahng machinery necessary. Beehive Reef, Dry Diggings, is as usual turning out well, 2 or 3 oz. per ton having been the average of the last crushings. Oh Pioneer Reef Messrs. Steele and Com pany have at last concluded the sale of their"], [43, "MINING SUEYEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 JANUAEY. 35 claims\u2014 prospect claim and No, 2 south, to gether 363 feet lineal measure, \u00a317,000 as far as I can learn being the figure. But with the exception of three or four claims besides, operations have been suspended on the whole line until the Great Reef Company's engine shall have reduced the water. very good shallow ground have been found near the heads of Brandy Hot and Butterfly Gullies ; but the extent of ground opened has been too limited to cause any marked im provement in the aspect of mining affairs in general. Notwithstanding, some of the parties in these places have done very well, the gold being very coarse and heavy, speci mens of from 6 to 1 6 oz. having been turned up during the month, and a considerable number of gullies in the immediate neighbor hood are now beiDg prospected, I hope with good results. The Great Reef Company have now fairly started pumping their engine shaft on Pioneer Reef, and crushing a quantity of stone left from the first working of the Great Reef I have not yet learned the result of crashing, but the machinery appears to work admirably. On the Wombat Hill a lead was some time ago discovered trending directly towards the police reserve, and parties now working it from tunnels, put in from the foot of the hill, are doing remarkably well. There is every reason to believe that the lead crosses the reserve, and there is a chance that mining in said reserve will shortly be allo wed on certain conditions. On New German Reef the gold was for some time lost, but has lately been restruck better than ever, and the companies at both ends are in excellent spirits. In puddling and sluicing, matters have con tinued the same as usual without almost any interruption by the dry season. Puddling has at least in most instances been continued, and although the proceeds generally speaking can not be called brilliant, still the steadiness of employment and yield is fully appreciated by our miners. Hence the greater majority always prefer even comparatively poor sluicing or puddling ground to the uncertainty of tub and cradle workings : and although during the pre ceding summers capital ground has yearly been opened, just through parties being compelled by want of water to prospect for new ground, still I do not believe that the miners have lost anything on the whole by having had to remain at their winter claims. With the exception of these places just named, there is hardly any tub and cradle workings in the southern part of the division, nearly all the old gullies, if worked at all, being faced out for puddling. In Yandoit very little of interest has occurred. In New Nuggety Gully none of the com panies of working miners have as yet began reaping the benefit of their industry ; but I am happy to be able to report that two of them are in a very fair way of getting to work, and I am fully persuaded that their perseverance and energy will ultimately be rewarded. Messrs. Hutchieson and Company have ap plied for a prospecting claim on the banks of Kangaroo Creek, east of Daylesford I have visited the ground, and think it very likely that good ground will be found in the locality, but the discovery has as yet only proved the auriferous character of the ground. About the rest of the gullies in Yandoit, matters have been very quiet, but companies of working miners are in course of formation for the purpose of working the bottom of Old German Gully and New Nuggety Gully, and I hope by degrees to see a more co operative system of working taking root in the division. Of tunnelling I can only say, that, judging by appearances, matters are very satisfactory. The leads through most of the basaltic hills are still being vigorously worked, and even ground formerly considered worked out, is found to pay very well for puddling the head ings and other refuse stuff. The basaltic chain of hills between Shepherd's Flat and Yandoit, along the Jim Crow Creek, is also having a fair share of attention, but the gutter has not yet been attained by any of the tunnels. I hope, however, shortly to be able to report that such has been the case, and the long missed continuation of the elevated plains lead been resound as rich as ever, and my prediction of it still continuing its course been verified. The Grand Junction Company have for some time stopped their workings, but have now, I believe, made fresh contracts for sinking their shaft, and the public appears to have great faith in the undertaking. Messrs. Harrison and Company's claim of ten acres, in the Lower Yandoit Plains, has also suspended operations through influx of drift water, but a splendid prospect has been obtained without bottoming their prospecting shaft, and the company is now taking steps to secure machinery. In alluvial sinking no very important disco veries have taken place. Several patches of"], [44, "36 MINING SUEVEYOES EEPOETS JANUAEY. St. Andrew's Division. considerable. The former owners of part of this ground were about to abandon it on the very eve of their finding the rich cjuartz alluded to, which yielded about \u00a38000 worth of gold from a few very small patches. (James Murphy, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 On Victoria Reef a claim has been taken up and is being worked with a good prospect of success, on ground that has been abandoned for more than a year. I am glad to be able to state that the tunnel belonging to the Yow-yow Mining Company is completed, and that the mine can now be regularly worked at a depth of fifteen fathoms below the summit level of the hill. At the junction of the tunnel with the old workings on Gillman's Reef the lode is about fifteen inches thick, and will, I believe, yield from two to three ounces of gold to the ton This is the first tunnel that has been completed in this division. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The tunnel on Smythe's Creek workings at Yow-yow is still progressing, but with some difficulties from the hardness of the rock and from foul air. They have now driven to a distance of 620 feet, but they have not as yet struck a reef, which is rather surprising, seeing that they have intersected the base line of Reed's Reef with about 264 feet of drive, and will intersect the base line of Gillman's Reef at 660 feet (see plan accompanying this re port) ; but the little that is known of the reefs in this hill goes to show, that they are so heaved and broken that it is impossible to cal culate their positions underground. This is owing probably to the upheaval of the granite in close proximity to these lodes. Great activity prevails on Barker's Reef also where the Smythe's Creek Company are carrying on tolerably extensive work ings. This vein averages about ten inches in thickness, and will be intersected by the tunnel. I have the honor to inform you that during the month of January but little deserving very particular notice in mining matters has occurred in this division. It will be seen, on referring to the foregoing table, that there is a slight decrease in the number of European miners, and an increase in the number of Chinese, since the month of December. At Oram's Reef a depth of 110 feet has been attained by Oram and party ; they have sunk on to the back of the lode in order to work upwards from galleries, stowing all their head ings, and thus economizing labor. Their last crushing yielded 14 oz. 14 dwt. of gold per ton The quartz that yielded this amount of gold per ton is a thin vein, not exceeding two inches in thickness, lying upon the back or west side of the main lode, which they are leaving behind, although it is about a foot in thickness, and will yield an ounce of gold to the ton. At Swedish Reef, on One Tree Hill, a depth of 1 50 feet has been attained in No 1 and in No. 2 North with no very great results as to yield at that depth. The same will in some measure apply to No. 2 South, although some twelve months ago the richest quartz ever raised was taken from some of these claims. However, it is what is called a bunchy or patchy vein, and therefore there is reason to hope that it will yet pay for all the outlay incurred, which has been very At Anderson's Creek quartz mining has re ceived a considerable impetus from the starting of Mr. Capper's machine, and the reduced rato of crashing, the price there now being \u00a31 per Occupation.

There are hundreds of gullies in this part of St Andrew's Division that would yield a high rate of remuneration if they were worked in the manner described above. Mr, Wilkinson's calcining and crushing ma chinery is standing, and so far as I can see there is no great likelihood of its getting work to do unless considerable improvement is made. Apart from efficiency, I have no doubt that Mr. Capper's machine will get a pre ference, as much is due to that gentleman by the miners, in consequence of his being the first to introduce in this division crushing at \u00a31 per ton. I herewith forward sheet 19 of plans illus trative of my division, being a plan of Yow yow and German Gullies. ARARAT MINING DISTRICT. Raglan, Ararat, and Pleasant Creek Divisions. (John Usher, jun., Mining Surveyor.) Thepopulation is as follows : \u2014 In alluvial mining, at Anderson's Creek, the Yarra Yarra Mining Company have ten men employed on their river workings, with what success I am unable to state. They have two steam engines at work, one pumping and the other for the purpose of driving the washing machinery and pumping also. River workings are being carried on by Messrs. Dixon, Jobbins, and party in the Yarra. immediately below and adjoining the leasehold of the Yarra Yarra Mining Company. Other river workings are being carried on about three miles above the township of War randyte (Anderson's Creek), by Messrs. Hast ings and party; but from the wetness of the season and the consequent floods, all these river workings are made twice as laborious and troublesome as they would be in the ordinary summer seasons. In Fern-tree Gully, on the Caledonia Gold Field, many parties have been very fortunate indeed. Three individuals are about to return to England, with what they consider sufficient to make them comfortable for life, obtained in that gully, for about four months' work. I was shown two very fine nuggets which were found there on the 26th of last month. One of them weighed 2 lb., and the other weighed 8 oz. The same party took out 8 oz. on the 28th, and a 10 oz. nugget was taken out by another party on the same day. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 In the Old Caledonia Creek Messrs. Howlett and party (occupiers of a puddler's claim) are doing exceedingly well with their horse pud dling machines, by simply washing the whole of the stuff in the bed of the creek. This is the first puddler's claim that has been made to pay for working in this division, and it is because they adopt the method of turning over the whole of the stuff and wash ing it. The other claimholders have been, and arc, in the habit of sinking holes and picking out the washing stuff as if for tub washing, and therefore they cannot make machine Total nur engag* iber of Persi d in mining.

Pleasant Creek Division. \u2014 The population at Four-posts rush is about 800, with every pros pect of a large increase ; several parties have obtained very large quantities of gold ; the ground is patchy and appears to be a con tinuation of the Deep Lead. Arrangements are pending for the erection of an engine of 40 or 50 horse-power, with pumps, pipes, &c, all complete, to be erected on the Cross Reef. Messrs.

Raglan Division. \u2014 I have not observed greater activity in any part of this district than within and adjoining the township of Beaufort ; several shafts are being sunk, and whims and other machinery are in course of erection, with a view to open up the deep ground and developing the Wet Leads. Some claims on these leads have been abandoned for a considerable time, owing to the large quantity of water there was to contend with. Some have already bottomed on the reef and are driving to the deep ground, others are confident of success. Several small rushes have taken place, but nothing of importance has been discovered.

The Koh-i-noor Company have driven to a distance of 540 feet in their new level, and, from the soft nature of the bed-rock, they expect to reach the gutter in about three months.

The Great Extended Company have recently purchased and erected a 25 horse power engine, in addition to their 35 horse power engine ; the latter is to be exclusively used in pumping and puddling. The dividends obtained by this company during the past month have been unusually large. * Four engines in course of erection, three of which are winding engines.

This company holds a claim measuring feet by feet, and have a battery of twelve stamps, and an engine of 25 horse-power, but have only very recently commenced work; indeed they cannot be said yet to have made a fair start but from trial crushings the yield of the quartz is estimated at from 8 to 10 dwt. to the ton. The company have only been at work for one week, and have not cleared up, but they will do so at the expiration of another week, when a more accurate estimate of the yield of gold will be obtainable.

Campbell's Gully.\u2014 The puddling companies in this gully are nearly all at a standstill from the want of water, Cummings and party being the only company at work. The Township Quartz Company have some time since discontinued operations ; the result of their crushings has not been such as would induce the company, as at present constituted, to make a further outlay in testing the reef. The manager calculates that with the twelve stamps the company will be able to crush from 180 to 200 tons of quartz per week, and they intend to employ hired men so soon as the machinery is in full operation, the number of shareholders (16) not being sufficient to Occupation.

At the present time the gold is being saved by three shaking tables and copper ripples coated with quick silver, but the manager proposes to adopt plain ripples, as no great gain is obtained by those now in use. twelve stamps, pumps, &c. The shaft has been sunk to a depth of 170 feet, and quartz has been struck, varying from 8 to 1 2 feet in width. A lode has also been struck on the western side of the claim, not far from the ground held by the Old Post-office Hill Company, which lode is supposed to be a continuation of that now being worked by the Old Canadian Quartz Mining Company, and has been found to be about 10 feet in thickness. The average yield of the gold has been found to be about 6 dwt. to the ton, and the quantity of quartz crushed is about 150 tons per week. The working expenses are estimated at \u00a350 per week The manager estimates that he will find 80 per cent, of the gold in the stamping boxes, a fact which would show that the gold is very coarse, whilst the remainder will be saved by means of the ripples and shaking tables. By reference to section No. 1. it will be seen, that the shaft has been sunk through 30 feet of alluvial, gravelly formation, 20 feet of red clay, and 18 feet in the clay slate, making a total depth of 68 feet. By reference to sheet No. II. it will be seen, that the shaft has been sunk to the depth named, principally through hard blue schist, and that a drive has been opened towards the east. After prospecting to a distance of 131 feet from the shaft they struck several small leaders, dipping eastward, which eventually led to a main vein or lode, which was struck at the northern side of the drive. This vein was cut through, and the drive continued to a further distance of 58 feet in the same direc tion where three other leaders were struck, which I consider are indications of the ex istence of another large body of quartz at no great distance. At this depth the company opened out the first level on the south side of the shaft (marked No. 1 on section) and struck the lode, which was found to vary from 20 to 30 feet in width. The lode is not one homogeneous mass, but is composed of a number of veins of broken clay slate, and dips rapidly to the west. The lode dips at an angle of 45\u00b0 to the west. The whole of the veins, clay-slate, &c, are passed through the stamping battery, and owing to the soft nature of much of the stuff taken, crushing is performed very rapidly. The eastern side of the lower level is a mass of solid quartz, about 25 feet in width, and in the face of the western drive the quartz veins are much thinner, and a solid mass of schist has been struck. From this level the shaft has been continued to a depth of 107 feet, and a chamber opened on the southern side, in the face of which the quartz has been found dip ping at the same angle as in the upper drive. They returned to the spot at which the main vein was struck, and opened out main levels to the north and south (marked A A on plan). Chambers have been opened in the eastern side of these drives, from whence the quartz is conveyed in trucks to the shaft. The lode appears to be dipping to the west at an angle of 45\u00b0. A section taken at C D shows the width of the quartz at the upper portion of the drive, which is composed of nearly horizontal leaders, and which run into one solid vein on the eastern side. A small prospecting drive has been opened towards the last, which is now in a distance of 25 feet, and the face of which is found to be a solid block of oxydized quartz A well has been suuk to a depth of six feet, in which quartz has also been struck. The longitudinal section is taken on the north side of the main drive. A large quantity of water is found in the levels, which appears to flow more from the leaders than from the solid veins. This is pumped to the surface ; one part is conveyed into a dam and used for crashing purposes the other part being made to flow down the pump shaft by means of a box, and thereby causing a current of air for the ventilation of the mine. A prospecting drive has also been opened to the westward, in which a lode 8 feet 1 0 inches has been struck. It is evident from the ap pearance of the numerous leaders and veins that at a greater depth they will be found to merge into one solid lode. A lode has also been struck on the surface by the company when forming their dam, which is shown upon the reduced plan hereto attached. In alluvial mining I have nothing to re port since my last communication to your Honorable Board The Speedwell Company have a claim mea suring feet by feet, and are generally considered to be on the Last Chance Lode. The company is composed of twenty share holders, and seven hired men are employed They commenced operations about eight months ago, and have been obtaining gold during the last three months The engine is of 25 horse-power, which works a battery of Two new quartz crushing companies have started their machinery during the last month, namely, the Welcome Nugget and the Wel lington Gigantea but as they have commenced crushing so recently I am unable to forward returns of the yield of gold.

No. 3 Division. (Thomas Cowan, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The thickness of the layer of cement is from two to eight feet, and is a ferruginous dark brown mass, being a mixture of quartz boulders held together by the cement. The whole has the appearance of being highly oxydized. The cement lies upon a schist reef, which is also found to be oxydized to a considerable depth. The machinery used by the company con sists of a battery of twelve stamps, worked by an engine of the power of 1 6 horses, and the company is composed of twelve men. They are able to raise and crush 1 20 tons per week with eight stamps, four being leased to another company at the rental of \u00a3\\6 per week. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The company crush a large quantity of the debris found upon the surface, which though it does not yield so large a return per ton as the solid mass, is found advantageous to work, in consequence of the facility with which it is obtained. A very large quantity of this debris is found, in some places to the depth of nearly 14 feet. In some of the shafts nearer the gutter a similar formation is found to exist, with the difference that in the deep ground a layer of wash-dirt, three to six feet in depth, was found between the cement and the schist reef. As these shafts have been abandoned for a long period, I was unable to obtain sections of the strata in them. Two engines in course of erection. The average yield of gold obtained from the cement is 5 dwt. per ton, but there is no doubt that a larger yield could be obtained, as the machinery now employed has been proved to be very defective. The total cost of the plant now used was \u00a31450. I beg to forward plans and sections of the workings of the Eureka Cement, and Penny weight Cement Companies, whose claims are situate on the Old Eureka Lead. These companies are engaged in crushing the cement which is found lying above the level of the gutter, and which in former times was not considered worth the trouble of working. The Pennyweight Cement Company hold a claim equal to an area of 6 acres 1 rood 13 perches, and number nine men. These companies are another among the many proofs of the increased field for mining operations given by the improvements made in the methods of working a field, which will be enlarged in proportion to the cheapness of labor and the reduction in the cost of obtaining suitable machinery. The ground worked by this company is con tiguous to that of the former company, and the cement being crushed is precisely the same as that crushed by the Eureka Company. The average yield is 4 dwt per ton, and with the four stamps leased from the Eureka Com pany, about 70 tons per week are crashed. The Eureka Company hold an area of ground equal to 6 acres 2 roods 2 1 perches near the junction of Esmond's Lead with the Eureka Gutter. The depth of alluvial sinking, as shown at point Z on plan, is 170 feet. The strata, as will be seen by the section, are the same as in the former company. Both companies have had great difficulties to over come, arising from the large quantity of water met with in working the ground, which is supposed to come from the drift. The strata are the same as those shown on the sections of the shafts on Pennyweight. In quartz mining I have nothing new to report.

In this cutting a lode is found 12 feet in width, dipping to the westward. The subjoined particulars of companies now at work, will show the nature and magnitude of the work being carried on. The company have also sunk a shaft to a depth of 180 feet, in which a lode 12 feet in width was struck, but it is not at present being worked, in consequence of the large quantity of water met with, i he trial crushings gave 7 dwt of gold to the ton, but subsequent operations did not prove so remunerative, though there is no doubt the operations will ultimately prove paying. The Danish Company hold an area of ground equal to 3 acres 3 roods 27 perches on Bakery Hill, and on the same lode as that worked by the Cornish United Company, on the Gum tree Flat. They have two engines, one equal to the power of eighteen horses, which is used for working the stamps; and the other, equal to the power of ten horses, which is employed for winding, pumping, &c. The work will in future be carried on under the contract system. The Wellingtonia Gigantea Company hold a claim of 1171 feet on the Black Hill Flat, and they have two engines, one of the power of thirty horses, the other equal to ten horses. They have a battery of twelve stamps, with square heads and iron shanks, and the gold is saved by means of shaking tables ; the latter being used in consequence of the large quantity of iron pyrites which is found in the quartz. They have a battery of sixteen stamps, which are on the revolving principle, and the gold is saved by means of shaking tables and ripples. A considerable loss of gold occurs, in conse quence of the defective construction of the tables and the shallowness of the ripples, but these defects will probably soon be remedied. The number of shareholders in the company is thirteen, who are employed in driving and raising the quartz ; nine hired men being employed on the surface to feed the hopper. attend the engines and empty the sand-pits. The shaft is now 118 feet in depth, and a level has been put in at a depth ot 100 feet. 1 he shaft is situate between two lodes ; the one at present being worked having been found to be 12 feet in width, dipping to the westward at an angle of 45\u00b0. The depth of the shaft is 235 feet, and there is a well 1 5 feet in depth. The company have put in two levels ; one at a depth of 200 feet, north and south on the course of the reef, which rises in one direction to the level of the gutter, and is connected with some old workings, thus proving the lode and ventilating the mine. The second level, which is at the greatest depth named, has only re \u25a0 cently been commenced ; but it is intended to work upwards to the higher level. The average yield of the quartz has hitherto been found to be about 10 dwt. to the ton. There are forty-eight shareholders in the company, who have spent .\u00a34000 in machinery and the works necessary for opening out the mine. Drives have been put in in various directions, for the purpose of working thin veins which are found rising to the surface of the bed-rock, and near what is supposed to be the Gravel Pits gutter, which crossed near this point. The Welcome Nugget Company have a claim measuring 3391 leet along the supposed course of the reef, situated to the north of the claim of the Danish Company They have an engine of the power of forty-five horses and a batteiy of twelve stamps . The lode varies from six to eight feet in width in some places, and from two to three feet in others. In some places the lode is found to be loose, aud intermixed with clay slate ; in others very hard and solid. 1 he have sunk six shafts ; five of which are of the following depths, namely, 40 feet 96 feet, 150 feet, 225 feet, and 250 feet, ihey have found several lodes, but up to the present time nothing remunerative has been struck. The yield of gold obtained from trial crush ings, made with quartz taken from the' 200 feet level, was found to be 10 dwt. to the ton; but subsequent crushings have given a smaller return. The result however has been remunerative. A sixth shaft is now being sunk, in search of the Fire-brigade Lode, and is now I SO feet in depth. 'Ihe company have shown great energy and perseverance. In alluvial mining I have no change to report. The old ground is principally worked by Chinese ; but I have been uuable to ascertain the result of their labors.

At the present time some claims are being held in reserve, in consequence of the want of water, and the number, both in alluvial and quartz mining, is likely to be increased. near the intersection of the road from Ballaa rat to Italian Gully, with the road from Bun inyong to Brown's, and about 5 miles from the latter place. The locality referred to had been prospected for some time by two Government prospecting parties, namely, Greaves and Com pany, and I believe Webb and Company ; the former (8 men) succeeded in discovering paying ground (yield 3 dwt. per tub) on 1 7th of January last, at a depth of 90 feet, and in accordance with the local bye-laws obtained a prospecting claim 800 feet by 300 feet. They in the first in stance opened out their drive or level I believe 8 or 10 feet too shallow, and in consequence have been put to considerable extra expense, inconvenience, and labor ; however I under stand the mistake, if not already, will be soon remedied, and then the company confidently expect to get even better prospects than the one mentioned. 1 he other Government party after sinking a shaft and putting in a level 40 or 50 feet in length found they were also too shallow, and decided a few days since to commence a new shaft which is being proceeded with vigor ously. Indeed, generally, all the shafts were originally sunk too much to the north, and in most instances they had to be abandoned and new ones commenced; the second set are being sunk as fast as the nature of the ground will permit, but as yet I understand none are bottomed, so that as yet the general paying nature of the ground is not throughly estab lished, the opinion however of the miners is favorable. The sinking as reported by the prospectors is rather difficult, being chiefly through various strata of cement, gravel, drift, and clay ; water was struck at a depth of 35 feet, but the main body estimated at 300 gallons per hour, proceeds from a drift 70 feet deep. The ground is presently worked under the block system, as the prospectors were not in a position to prove the existence of a lead or gutter, at the time of the discovery, nor are they even yet able to do so though morally certain a lead does exist ; a contingency which I apprehend will be found productive of much loss and disappointment to the miners as the workings proceed, and as the depth and diffi culties of sinking increase, except Bye-law No. XII. of the Miuing Board recently gazetted shall in the mean time be repealed. This bye-law (inter alia) enacts that all alluvial ground where the depth of sinking is less than 150 feet, shall be worked under the block system, and as in all probability the lead in question will not have attained the requisite depth (150 feet) for upwards of a mile below the last claim already occupied (there being a considerable fall in the surface) the result will be, in the event of the lead being tolerably payable, that several block claims will be taken up abreast of each other, or on the ground which under the frontage system would lie within the parrallels of one company, and as The loss that will be sustained by companies having to stop work, should they have to do so for a long period, will be very serious, and many men will be thrown out of employment. From this may be judged the great good that would accrue to this gold-field by the bringing in of an adequate supply of water, as the com panies could then pursue their operations con tinually, besides avoiding the immense expense incurred for the building of dams for the storage of storm-waters.

Deep Leads \u2014 Frenchman's and Whitehorse. The Cumberland, Durham, and Cornish Com pany on this lead have worked out their claim, and although the ground was very rich, as much as 7000 oz. having been obtained from about 390 feet of the gutter, still from the small size of the claims taken up under the bye-laws of 1856, and the enormous amount of machinery, calls, &c., (\u00a315,000) coupled with the heavy law expenses, (upwards of \u00a31100) attendant on the suit with the Red Jacket Company, owners of an adjoining claim, I believe the gross amount of dividends received per man has not exceeded \u00a3 1 60, which would not give much over \u00a332 per man, per year, since the company was formed. None of the three remaining companies have yet reached the gutter ; the Nelson Company next adjoining are down about 343 feet, and in the fourth rock which contains very little water, but is exceedingly hard and difficult to blast; they, as well as the Working Miners Company outside them, are expecting to get through the fourth rock shortly, and be in a position to give some information regarding the probable future course of the lead, which is now a matter of much speculation and uncer- tainty. The general opinion however is, that its course will be southward, or in the direction of Cobbler's though presently it appears to be trending in an opposite direction, and until the two companies above mentioned get bottomed and into the gutter no further light is likely to be thrown on this very interesting subject. And here I am reminded of a matter already adverted to by me, and to which I would again beg to call attention, namely, the desirable ness of having a survey made of all the leads from Inkermann, No. 1 division, to Durham, No. 5 division, showing the position of each of the shafts on the several leads, the surface levels, and depth of shafts, to be also shown on an accompanying section ; if this were done I am certain it would give great satisfac tion to the district generally, and moreover it would give an impetus to mining enterprises, inasmuch as it would go far to point out or indicate the future course of the Ballaarat united or grand trunk lead, and thereby cause considerable extent of ground to be prospected that under present circumstances will not be touched; the whole thing in my opinion could be done for about \u00a350 or \u00a360. Cobbler's Lead. \u2014 There are at present only two companies at work on this lead, one, the Camp Company, only got into the gutter a few weeks since, and as far as I can understand are quite likely to get compensated for four years' preliminary or dead labor; they have washed from some machines of stuff as high as 60 oz , and I am informed expect a dividend of from \u00a380 to \u00a3100 per man for the current fortnight ; they have not more than an ordinary amount of gutter water, though the Prince of Wales Company, next ahead of them, are presently swamped out, and have as much as 160 feet of water in their shaft. This com pany got into some sort of auriferous ground twelve months ago, and have been up to the present working therein with but very indiffer ent success ; the stuff has been so poor that the gross dividends for eight or nine months have only amounted to about \u00a340 per man ; the company however are in hopes of getting better ground at a lower level, as they have been unable to test the deepest portion of the ground in consequence of having opened out too shallow. Moreover they are strongly under the impression that they have not as yet got into the Cobbler's gutter at all, as the quality and general appearance of the stuff hitherto obtained by them are quite different from what is being got by their neighbors the Camp Company. Indeed the prevailing opinion seems to be that there is a junction of the Frenchman's Lead with Cobbler's somewhere close to and above their workings, and that as soon as they get to work the deep ground within their claim, they will experience a marked improvement in their dividends ; how ever this may be, they have recently pnrcha;ed"], [56, "46 MINING SUEVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 FEBRUARY. from a Geelong firm for \u00a31300, a 50 horse engine, with two boilers, each 35 feet long, by 7 feet in diameter, which I understand are expected on the ground in a day or two ; their present depth is 343 feet, while the depth of the Cumberland, Durham, and Cornish Com pany's shaft opposite or abreast of them, on Frenchman's, is 345 feet, the intervening dis tance being about 4300, and the difference in surface levels 50 feet, Cobbler's of course being the lower. Further north the Oriental Company have been unsuccessful in their first crushing, which is reported to have yielded only 8 oz to 100 tons ; a very general impression however pre- vails among the most experienced miners on the reef, that there is a screw loose some- where with the Orientals, as this rate of yield, they assert, would be obtained from the cast-away rubbish scattered plentifully all over the hill. The New Homeward Bound Com- pany on the south side gave up their leasehold a couple of months since to the person from whom they (conditionally) purchased it, al- leging that the ground did not pay, but there appears to be some misunderstanding between the parties regarding the conditions of sale, which must be settled in the Court of Mines, and in the meantime the ground will remain unworked ; ultimately I feel satisfied this claim will, if properly managed, be found to yield handsome returns, though as yet neither the Old nor the New Homeward Bound Com pany could make it do so. The Alston and Weardale Company, Craw fish Lead, and Scottish and Cornish Company, Black Lead, are driving in search of their re spective gutters. The former have not as yet got into the gutter, though they thought twelve months since they were too deep for it, and imagined they got indications by boring up wards in favor of this belief, whilst in reality they were 90 feet too shallow ; this dis tance has been since sunk through a drive opened out at the lower level, but the gutter not yet reached. The Scottish and Cornish Company worked out some five or six hundred feet of the eastern portion of their claim, and by some accident or mistake lost the \" run\" of the deep ground three or four months since, and have not yet succeeded in refmding it ; they are however in daily expectation of doing so, and should the quality of the stuff warrant an additional heavy outlay for ma chinery, &c, I believe the company intend working the claim in the most approved manner ; the claim embraces some 3500 feet along the course of the gutter, and if the wash dirt, of which there is a very fair quantity, should realise expectations as to quality, the company have several years' profitable work before them. The Mentor Company has been of late ob taining at the rate of 12 dwt per ton from stone found at a depth of 170 feet, and claim No. 9, now belonging to the company, is re ported to be yielding still better. No. 10 Com pany have recently obtained 51^ oz. from 54 tons ; and No. 14 Company obtained at the rate of 8 dwt. per ton from their stone, both crushings being made at the Mentor Com pany's mill, Penrose Reef, Moonlight Flat. \u2014 The pro- spectors on this reef recently realized 113J oz. from 238 tons taken from a depth of about 40 feet, which if added to the amount (150 oz.) previously washed from time to time during the last 1 7 months from the same stone, would give a gross yield of 263 oz. to 238 tons. The Great Eastern Company, adjoining, have lately been getting better stone as the depth increases ; from a late crashing they have obtained 5 dwt. per ton from 25 tons taken from a depth of 100 feet, and only 2| dwt. per ton from 95 tons taken from a depth of 60 feet in another shaft ; they are now getting the 100 feet shaft sunk by contract 30 feet deeper, with high hopes as to results. The next claim (No. 2) is abandoned as a rank duffer for the present. There is little or nothing doing of late on the old ground about Paddy's Gully ; and indeed the same may be generally reported of all the old ground workings in the division, with the exception perhaps of Kangaroo Gully, where one or two small parties continue to do very well ; and of Yorkey's Hill, Lower Pineh gut, where two or three parties also have been obtaining about \u00a35 or \u00a36 per man per week during the last five or six months. Whim Holes and Little Hard Hills.\u2014 There is very little doing in this locality at present, owing partly to want of water, but especially to the fact of all the known auriferous hills and gullies being pretty well exhausted The claim of the Progressive Company, abandoned some six months since, is not yet reoccupied, but I believe it soon will as some of the old shareholders are dissatisfied with the manner in which the ground was prospected, and evince a disposition to make up a new company, and give the place a further trial, which if carried out in an efficient manner will, I trust, be the means of opening up a long reach of paying ground \u2014 a consummation under present cir cumstances very much to be desired. Staffordshire Reef \u2014 The Comet Company have obtained during the last month 62 oz from 198 tons, and have recently struck a reef in the northern portion of their leasehold at a depth of 90 feet, four feet thick, from which, judging by the promising appearance of the stone, they expect to realize at least 15 dwt.

The population is as follows : \u2014 On the Napoleon Lead but little progress has been made towards developing the gutter during the month. The Franklin Company has not been at work at the face for some weeks past, being swamped out by a breakage in the machinery. On the Union Jack Lead the Pactolus Com pany, which up to the present time has failed to pay even wages, has let their claim oh tribute. The Devonshire and Green Hill Leads are at present unoccupied. Quartz Mining. \u2014 The Imperial Company, Hiscock's Reef, has crushed during the month 600 tons of quartz, which has yielded about 220 oz. The Standard Company has struck the reef in their second shaft at a depth of 80 feet, and it is hoped that they will now be enabled to keep their battery continually at work, the same having been hitherto but occasionally engaged through an insufficient supply of quartz ; their yield has been about 5 dwt. per ton. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The All Nations Company, on the All Nations Reef, has crushed about 400 tons during the month, with an average yield of 9 dwt. to the ton. The Britannia Company, on the W hite Horse, have been steadily at work, and have realized about 5 dwt. per ton. The Jenny Lind Company, on the Scan dinavian Reef, has started their battery of six teen heads, the result of which I have not yet ascertained. The Hard Hill has again been taken up, and a battery of sixteen heads is now being put up for the purpose of crushing the cement and tail ings from the puddling machines. On the Deep Leads so little change has Creswick Division. taken place during the month that my report thereon will of necessity be very short. (James Stevenson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows ; \u2014 The Pioneer Company, on the Durham Lead, having struck the gutter some time since, are progressing but slowly, through want of air. They are now engaged in erecting air ma chines. The average yield of the dirt already washed has been about 5 dwt. to the load. The Convention Company, on the Durham Lead, are not yet through the rock, and from the depth attained there is every probability of their bottoming in or near the gutter. The Leviathan and John Bull Companies are at present yielding good wages. The Polar Star and Great Britain Com panies have as yet failed to meet with any re muneiative wash-dirt. Occupation.

The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The Hard Hill Cement Crashing Company have added four head of stamps to their battery, which is now composed of twelve heads ; this company have crushed for various parties 65 tons of cement, which yielded 37 oz. 14 dwt. 20 gr. ; and for themselves, 410 tons of head ings, tailings, &c, which yielded 88 oz., or an average of 4 dwt. 7 i? gr. per ton. The Enterprise Company have crushed for Dunn and party 118 tons of cement which yielded 58 oz. , or an average of nearly 9 dwt. 20 gr. ; owing to the absence of the secretary I have been unable to obtain the return of the quantity crushed for themselves by this company. The Little Wonder Company crushed 200 tons of tailings, &c, which yielded 35 oz., or an average of 3J dwt. per ton. The Friendship Crushing Company have crashed 740 tons of tailings, &c , which yielded 105 oz., or an average of 2 dwt. 20 per ton ; this company also crushed from a quartz claim they hold on St George's Reef, 1 1 tons, which yielded 6 dwt. per ton. The Frenchman's Quartz Mining Company are sinking a main shaft, 6 feet by 5 feet ; they are down 110 feet, but intend going a further depth of 90 feet. This company have crushed from the 1st to the 16th February, 160 tons, yielding 52 oz. 18 dwt. 18 gr ; and from the 16th ult to the 2nd inst., 160 tons, yielding 37 oz. 8 dwt. 12 gr. ; the total quantity being 320 tons, and yield 90 oz. 7 dwt. 6 gr., or an average of 5 dwt. 18 gr. per ton. At Ironstone Hill, Slaty Creek, only two parties continue to get payable ground ; twelve claims have been taken up during the month, but only two of these have bottomed, and although both have got gold, it is not suffi ciently rich to pay for working ; both parties continue driving, hoping for a better result. The Bald Hills Lead continues to pay equally as well as formerly ; during the month the Garibaldi Company bottomed at 139 feet, and obtained a prospect of 1-J dwt. to the tub; they have since struck the gutter, from which they obtained a prospect of 5^ dwt. to the tub. The Independent, and the Rise and Shine Companies have also bottomed, but on the reef, the former at a depth of 1 00 feet, and the latter at 90 feet, the ktter how ever purpose sinking a new shaft. The prospects of Clunes mining, as stated in my last report as of an encouraging character, is being consummated, by the erection of the several additional engines ; more miners are being employed, and although the results show no extraordinary increase of yields, still this part of my district is promising to rapidly advance. The energy displayed by the companies, both on north and south side of the creek, shows the character of the miners and capitalists. I am pleased to commend their energy. The parties are at work in Bullock Gully, but nothing definite has been done in ascer taining the course, or in fact proving the existence of the lost vein of gold in this gully. The Port Phillip Company have completed the building of their assay office, attached to their works, and have during the month crushed 2445 tons of quartz, which yielded 1588 oz. 15 dwt. The assaying department is in full working order. At Bullarook another party of Italians have found the continuation of the lead struck in November last; the snking is 57 feet deep, of which 50 feet is honeycomb rock; the prospect obtained is 1 dwt. to the tub.

The workings on Robinson's Reef, from the south whim shaft, are discontinued, the stone being raised from the south engine shaft. This reef is still nearly 30 feet wide. The workings on the Eastern Reef are being carried out more fully ; no change is apparent in its usual bearings. They are removing their mining fence, to obtain more room for the storage of timber, &c. under the co-operative system), owing to then deficiency of capital, and have therefore not paid the dividends the yields of gold should have warranted them. New North Clunes Company are down with their new shaft 180 feet. They are building a dam 1 00 feet square, for the supply of water for their new engine. Tenders are out for the erection of the poppet heads; also, cutting a flat at 200 feet deep, making cistern, and pre paring timber for the next 1 00 feet. The Criterion Company, from the 9th February to the 16th, crushed 207 tons, which yielded 96 oz. 2 dwt. ; for the fortnight ending 2nd March, they reduced 372 tons, which yielded 139 oz. 8 dwt. 17 gr. Victoria Company have completed the sink ing of their shaft to 350 feet, and opened a drive at 335 feet, due east ; they are in about 125 feet. They expect to strike the reef daily ; the pumping gear answers well ; the plunger lift works 240 feet; the drawing lifts 110 feet lower down. The water is still very heavy in this mine ; but it is expected to be more so when they cut the reef. From the present bearings of the Welcome Reef, it is supposed to be about 60 feet from the Eastern Reef. The works are at this time stopped for the erection of a new cam shaft ; their high-level tramway is completed ; the landing platform, for the delivery of quartz to their two kilns, or the small stone directly to the hoppers, is of a very complete and solid character The tracks travel upon iron 2\\ inches wide by \\\\ inch, placed on its edge. Yankee Company crush about 135 tons per week, at an average yield of If oz. per ton. Their large boiler is being placed ; its length is 35 feet by 7 feet in diameter. They are stoping the backs of No. 6 drive of Robinson's Reef, which is 25 feet wide, as far as worked; but here they have not seen the western wall, as it is not thought desirable to risk the damaging of their machinery ; they have cross-cut this lode, in then- bottom drive, at a depth of 1 60 feet ; this is 60 feet below the No. 6 drive, so that the company have a fine piece of ground opened out. The stone of No. 6 level is being raised at a cost of 7s. per ton ; at present it has to be lifted twice, but shortly this will be avoided. The timber for poppet heads for the new shaft is on the ground. This shaft is now down 140 feet ; it is intended to be 300 feet. The old shaft is intended to be sunk so as to correspond in their workings. At 200 feet deep there appears to be a junction of lodes ; the width is not yet known. All the contracts are let for the timbering work, and the engine is being erected. The late heavy expenses incurred by this company, amounting to \u00a31800 for improve ments, have prevented a dividend being paid. They are now in excellent working order. Alliance Company have erected their poppet heads over the new shaft, and nearly com pleted the building of their boilers and engine. They are about to open a flat at the present water level, and as soon as their pumping gear is ready they will sink deeper.

Alluvial \u2014 There is nothing new in this branch of mining ; the few miners who are working in All Nations and the west side gullies are making moderate wages ; the parties who are puddling surfacing are par tially stopped from want of water. A quartz reef has been opened about half-a-mile N.E. from Corduroy, but there has not been sufficient work done on it yet to enable me to form an opinion of its size or character ; several fine specimens have been shown as taken from it, but I have not seen any gold in the stone. The Victoria Company, Outward Bound Reef, have given up work ; they tried the reef at various depths from the surlace, to a depth of 94 feet, but found it would not pay for working. Homeward Bound Company drove in from their main shaft at a depth of 35 feet, and found the reef broken up, with several large leaders converging towards ; they could not find any gold in the quartz ; they are now sinking to a depth of 130 feet before trying the reef again. They have also erected a horse puddling machine for the purpose of washing auriferous surfacing which lies over the line of reef; they have had no results from it yet but from trials of the stuff by tub and dish they expect a good return by washing on a large scaie.

I have nothing of importance to report for the past month ; mining matters are very dull, and unsatisfactory as to their present or pro bable progress, as far as present appearances indicate, although as I last reported, if con ducted properly, and according to the conditions mentioned in applications for leases, as to number of men to be employed, power of machinery, and capital to be expended, cannot fail to produce good and payable results.

The Wellington Reef Company are at pre sent having a crushing at the Blackwood machine ; by my next report the result will be known. I have not been on Morrison's, Tea tree, and Dolly's Creeks for the past month, and judging from the non-requirement of my services there, I am induced to think mining matters are comparatively in the same state as when I last reported. I go there to-morrow. [The foregoing report for January arrived too late for publication with those for that month.] Steiglitz Division. (Thomas Woolgrove, Mining Surveyor.)

If such should prove to be the case I will for ward you sections of the countiy, which are remarkable for their geological peculiarities. I believe the Sailors' Reef Company have completed their arrangements for erecting ma chinery of a large and powerful character on their claim, and sink a large winding and pumping shaft to the eastward of their present works ; from the quality of quartz lately raised, and the large quantity probably obtain able, the company is induced to invest as above. I have not the slightest doubt they will be amply remunerated. The Union Company is at present idle, but a new vein has been struck to the eastward of their ground, and taken up by a party calling themselves the Junction Company ; the sue-"], [62, "52 MINING SUEVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 FEBRUARY. cess of this latter company may induce the Union Company still to persevere. The Perseverance Company still continue their operations, but up to this time with no success, nor do I see any probability of it. The Cosmopolite Company have as yet taken no steps, as far as I can judge, as to placing machinery on their claim ; there is some delay .occasioned in operations, pending a decision whether or not they should have their lease cancelled. The Far North Company are still working the ground formerly known as Chronometer Reef: their quartz is being stacked for the same reason as that from the Wellington Reef. The Ballaarat prospect party have for warded to Ballaarat two tons of quartz as a trial ; the result has not yet been received on this field, but judging from the average stone I saw, will prove remunerative. A race has been surveyed and levelled from the Moorabool Falls, about two and a half miles above the Lal-lal Falls, to Dolly's Creek, and branching into Mount Doran and Little Mount Doran. It is proposed to carry (he water over the Lal-lal Falls by a flume, and continue it at a fall of eight feet in a mile., and for about eighteen miles in length to the said Dolly's Creek. This will be a great ac quisition to the district, and prove payable to the parties engaged in the enterprise. I may mention that the country I travelled over between the said points gave every indication of being auriferous, and this race will be the means to develop the auriferous qualities of the Green Hill Ranges, which have hitherto been unable to be worked from scarcity of water. The Steiglitz Company have issued fresh tenders for sinking an additional 50 feet in their main shaft ; had they in the first instance continued sinking instead of fossiking about ground comparatively worked out, some good results must have been arrived at ere this ; however, it is a step in the right direction, and must eventually succeed. The Gibraltar Company's ground is still unworked ; some arrangements are being made for placing larger machinery on theirmain shaft. The Redan Company, New Chum Reef, have not yet commenced operations. The New Chum Reef Company have, nearly completed the erection of their crushing ma chinery, and completion of their dams and re servoirs; a large number of men have been constantly employed on these works. I ex pect in a week or two works will be com menced in their ground and mine. The Morning Star Company is progressing energetically and satisfactorily. They have up to the present time had no crushing, being engaged in erecting their machinery, baling the water from the old workings, and making the ground in good and workable order ; then is no doubt of their ultimate success. Blackwood Division. (Thomas Hay, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Albion Company have issued tenders for sinking their main shaft to the depth of 500 feet, so there will be no results in the shape of crushing for some time to come. The Norfolk Company have not yet com menced operations, but, I think, intend shortly. Private Companies. \u2014 The Birmingham Reef Prospect Claim has been protected for one month, pending the proving the quality and quantity of quartz in the Junction Reef. The Malakhoff Company still continue then works in their usual steady and uniform manner, and with their average returns. I heard that some very rich quartz was found in their claim, about the middle of this week. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Scotchman's Reef Company had lately a crushing, which averaged 2 oz. per ton ; they still continue their operations. The Wellington Reef Company are stacking the quartz raised for a long time, awaiting the completion of Messrs. Pyke and Trench's machinery ; they expect from 2 oz. to 3 oz. per ton. The New Year's Reef vein still looks as well and promising as ever ; no crushings have been made lately from this reef.

In my last report I mentioned that the Imperial Company had just completed a fresh winning, which I am glad to say has turned out successfully ; they have struck into a vein of quartz 1 5 feet thick, yielding, as far as it has been tried, upwards of 1J oz. of gold to the ton of quartz, and their present prospects are still more encouraging, as the quartz ap pears to be speckled all throngh with gold. and the yield likely to be increased. The Simmons' Reef Quartz Mining Com pany have not yet got up their steam, engine and patent quartz crushing machine; but they are working steadily in the mine, and landing a quantity of quartz in stock. '1 he Cornish Company have crushed a little in the early part of the month, but have been obliged to stop through want of water. The mine is regularly at work. Appleton Brothers are the only parties who have done anything approaching to regular work on this reef for the last two months, and they are still proceeding in a steady business like manner. have just applied for an extended area by way of lease. Johnson's Reef \u2014 Nothing has been done on this reef during the month beyond getting quartz; no crushing has been effected; the quartz looks promising. Alluvial Diggings. \u2014 The want of water is much felt in this department of digging, and a few parties have lately left for some distant new rushes. The rush in Pyrette Gully to the northward of Bacchus Marsh has been visited during the month by many itinerant diggers, 'but few remained beyond three or four days. The claims already taken are doing very fur on the average, and the whole appears now to assume something like the nucleus of a dig gings that may grow to importance. The adjacent country (ihe Bullencrook Ranges) being decidedly auriferous, will no doubt lead to prospecting and further discoveries. The present operations are confined to a narrow dry gully.

The population is as follows: \u2014 Trewhella's Reef. \u2014 The United Company have just got their new engine finished, and drained the mine of water ; the works have been at a stand for some months, but I am told that it is their intention now to proceed with vigor ; some quartz has already been brought to the surface, but as yet no crushing has taken place. Sherwood, Taylor, and Company are still going on very prosperously, the crushing pro ducing on the average more than 2 oz. to the ton. The Pioneer Company have not realized during this month their usual yield of gold, their crushings having averaged no more than about 10 dwt to the ton. This falling off in the yield is accounted for from their having crushed a great quantity of what is techinally called mullock mixed up with the quartz. Wilson's and Garibaldi Reefs \u2014 Some of the claims on the Garibaldi are about to get some quartz crushed, but they labor under great disadvantage from not having a machine on or near the spot. Newman's Reef \u2014 The only shaft that has struck this reef is that on the prospecting claim. There is good quartz being landed here, but no crushing has been made lately. There are two other claims here, neither of which have as yet found the reef, although both shafts are upwards of 100 feet down.

Alluvial Mining \u2014 This has been an ex cellent month for those who have had a good supply of water, and I think the majority of the puddlers in my division have been pretty well off in that respect ; the weather has been remarkably dry and fine and all those deep parts of the flats and gullies that are only accessible to, for water, &c, during the very dry weather, have been got at with undoubted results, frequently these places yield upwards of 1 0 oz. per puddling mill full. The stone that Moon's party are working is very black, and appears to have been coated over by the fumes of some gaseous body, but when broken presents the appearance of gas cinder, and in some instances equally light ; this stone lies close upon the west side of the reef, and from two to six feet thick, it also dips to the south, independent of the reef upon which it is imbedded. The rush to the Sheep Wash has cooled down a little ; there are about 60 miners in all in and around the spot, most of whom are 1 believe making good wages. Alluvial mining has not deteriorated much lately in its real value; its yields are nearly the same as three years ago, and there seems to be nearly the same life and bustle as there was then ; the excitement becomes greater as the gullies become worked out, and consequently more demand for what little there is left. Glasgow Reef is beginning to look more business like, and to show quite a new feature to the general tone of the last three years preceeding. Eight claims are getting gold in two different places ; five claims to the south of the pumping engine averaging 1 oz., and three one mile farther north, averaging about I oz. per ton ; other claims are preparing, so that by the time they cut the reef in the engine shaft, a good proportion of the line will be at work. Quartz Mining \u2014 This, the most import ant branch, or I might say main source of future mining operations, is reviving into some reanimation and certainly looks considerably brighter than it did three months ago. Several prospecting claims have been ap plied for this month in and around the district, some of whom have struck gold, but it gene rally takes twelve months before anything is again heard of them. Perse verence Reef \u2014 This line is a con tinuation northwards of the Windmill Hill and Johnston's Reef; the stone is found similarly imbedded, aud of about equal thickness and richness in quality with two or three claims on that line. In walking across the heads of Sparrow Hawk, Derwent, and New Zealand Gullies, a few days ago, I was very much struck with the fine appearance the country there presented for the prosecution of quartz mining, wondering why so little had been done in that locality, as every little rise or lull pre sented its out-cropping of quartz, or some other further demonstrative indication of the presence of a reef, and the gullies above men tioned were found all over equally and very rich. Kershaw's Claim yielded last crushing about 20 oz per ton, and out of 18 tons, a cake was produced weighing 350 oz. A share (one-sixth) in this claim could have been purchased six months ago for \u00a330, and so it has been with the most of our rich claims ; and many of those claims that are at present constantly being given and taken at a nominal sum, would be equally valuable if properly wrought, or assistance given to the owners for that purpose ; this rich quartz crops out in the claim to the north of Kershaw's, and dips rapidly to the south, so that not above three claims would catch the same stone above water level. From this point two miles north-west, the quartzose ranges continue, after which the country opens out into a partially well timbered flat plain, the creeks, &c, from which flow into the same direction, and joining Bullock and Myer's Creeks, empty themselves into the Tandra Plains. Sheep's Head Reef. \u2014 This line at present is taking the lead in the quantity of work being done upon it ; the majority of the old claims have resumed work and most are doing well.

In quartz mining this state of apathy in the miners may be attributed to the superabundance of water, as on those reefs that have pumping engines the work goes on with spirit, and the claims yield their average amount of gold ; whereas, those which do not possess those ad vantages are comparatively idle, and are likely to remain so for the present The miners are willing enough to go to work, if they could profitably, for they are all persuaded that their claims will yield payable gold, as many have struck gold and water almost simultaneously. A good example of the benefits to be derived from a pumping engine on a wet reef is evident in the working of the Specimen Hill Company. This company holds a large area of ground on lease, has erected a powerful pumping and winding engine, and has succeeded so well as In my printed report of last month I notice a mistake made in reference to the wash-dirt of Kneebone's and McEvoy's claims on the Eldorado I stated that the depth of the former was from 3 to 6 feet, and of the latter 12 to 15 feet, not 12 by 15 or 3 by 6 feet, as stated, as the breadth in the former is upwards of 40 yards.

Owing to the extreme dry weather during the past month, our supply of water has been greatly reduced, a number of parties in both divisions having to work short hours Not withstanding this, mining matters continue in a very prosperous condition. Two new puddling mills mentioned in my last report as in course of erection, have commenced work. Tanning through land belonging to Mr. John Wallace, in whose land it was first discovered by a party of men who were unaware that it was private property ; this lead runs into the ranges reserved for the municipal water scheme. The other is situated in Paddy's Gully, Bow man's Forest. The upper part of this gully, some 1 20 chains off, has shallow diggings from one to twelve feet deep, and which increases as it descends the gully, and is 145 feet at the pro specting claim ; its depth of wash-dirt 3 feet ; breadth not exactly known ; four loads gave 1 oz. 6 gr. In both the above-named divisions alluvial mining matters do not suffer such continual changes as is general in other parts everything here goes on in one continual round of steady uniform work ; the only change being a greater or less supply of water, occasioning a greater or less number of claims being worked, a greater or less demand for hands, or a greater or less number of working hours. I have nothing further of importance to communicate. Water is of course a scarce commodity at this time of the year, and the miners are obliged to accommodate themselves accordingly. In many cases claims can only be worked during the winter months, the owners being obliged to register them dry during the summer, and either remain idle until the ensuing winter. or seek for work elsewhere, until a supply of water enables them to return and work then old claim. Enclosed I send a plan (containing 172 chains) of the remaining portion of the Wool shed with the Napoleon, which connects my plan of last month with that of the 14th March, 1860.

In quartz mining I have to report the dis covery of two new reefs, one in the Nine Mile Division, named the Prince of Wales, but since abandoned, the other the Mona Reef, situated about a quarter of a mile to the eastward of Henderson's Reef, and seeming to run nearly parallel thereto ; the stone from this reef looks very well.

I am sorry to say that an ac cident happened, a few davs ago, at the Town ship Claim, Chiltern Lead, by the bursting of the boiler, which will cause some detention before again commencing work. The Great Eastern engine-house, in the Stockyard Gully, took fire on the 23rd February, and was com pletely burnt down. This will be the means of further retarding the development of this lead.

The remaining leads arc not, as yet, considered payable, though several patches have prospected very well. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The reefs in this locality have not yet been tested by crushing, beyond a small quantity which was forwarded to Messrs Chalmers and Gitchell's mill, at Chiltern, and which averaged over an ounce to the ton The general im pression is, that all the surface caps will average over an ounce to the ton. Messrs Smith and Son are removing their machinery from the Black Dog Creek to the River Murray, upon John Foord's pre-emptive, Wahgunyah, and a new machine is being erected by the same parties, so that the Wahgunyah Reefs may shortty be tested, without submitting to the expense of sending the quartz to Chiltern. Of the quartz reefs, I beg to forward you the particulars for the last month's crushing from the various reel's or leaders in this district, by Messrs. Chalmers and Gitchell's machine ; the other one, originally on the Black Dog Creek, is now being removed and re erected on the Murray River, for the Wahgun yah Reefs : \u2014 During the month our population has been very unsettled, in consequence of the many rushes in this Colony aud New South Wales. The Carorva Diggings situated on the New South Wales side of the Murray, about four miles from Wahgunyah, attracted the attention of a great many miners, but the ground proved to be so patchy, that it is now all but deserted. Many have also left for the Lambing Flat and Mountain Creek Diggings. On the whole, our diggings are at present in a very depressed condition, owing to the great want of water I would urge the desir ability of making plenty of dams to catch ihe surface drainage.

Buckland Division. (R. H. Stone, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 On the Elgin Reef Messrs Stephens and Co. have struck the vein 2 feet wide, but no gold can be seen in the stone ; at present it is only a broken reef, but as the walls continue smooth and solid there continues every probability of this party's ultimate success. Richardson's Reef continues to yield as well as usual, and this company are driving a tunnel into the reef, which they will strike at a depth of about 1 45 feet. From this tunnel levels will be driven along the reef, and the quartz raised at much less expense than at present. The Woolshed Reef has entirely run out at a depth of 90 feet, without a trace of quartz or any continuation of the walls or casing. The prospectors are now driving for a back reef which partly crops out about 30 feet west of the one worked. They are of the opinion that this will prove to be the main reef; no gold has been seen on the surface, it has therefore not been tried before. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 On the Hibernian Reef the Prospectors' and No. 1 North Claims yield occasionally a few tons of good quartz, but no solid reef has been struck. In No. 1 North the reef was first struck at a depth of 90 feet, and was then solid and about 8 feet wide ; at a depth of about 96 feet it again formed into a broken reef, in which there is little or no gold. The Prospectors' Claim is only sunk to a depth of about 70 feet, and the vein has been a succession of patches of solid and broken quartz, the solid stone only being of any value. In both instances the walls are very smooth and firm. I therefore believe that a good reef will ultimately be struck. There is no change to report of the alluvial workings in this division except a small decrease in the amount of gold raised during February, in consequence of a scarcity of water. 'S The party in occupation of No. 1 North, on the West Briton, have crushed about 15 tons, which only yielded 7 dwt. per ton. No stone has yet been crushed from the Prospectors' Claim. On the Nelson Reef, Messrs. Tracy have only crushed a very small quantity of stone, as they have not had sufficient water to drive their machine. All the quartz from this reef is expected to be very poor, although it was opened with splendid prospects from the casing stones. Murray's Reef (Lower Buckland). \u2014 The prospecting party have not yet crushed any of their quartz, and the reef has run out at a depth of 70 feet. They are still sinking for the main vein. The Duke of Northumberland and Hampton Reefs continue to look well. The Lisbon Keef is again being prospected, but I have no report of it at present. There has been considerable improvement in the Oriental Reef this month. The quartz from the prospectors' claim continues to yield well, and from Nos. 1 and 2 South some very rich quartz has been raised; that from the latter. however, has not yet been crushed, but it is expected to yield about 6 oz. per ton. On several of the smaller reefs crushings of payable quartz continue to be obtained. In must instances, the quartz crushed is raised principally from shafts sinking for the purpose of prospecting for larger veins. The yields are, in many instances, insufficient to induce the claimholders to open out on the quartz. On Gander's Reef, the water being now clear, Occupation. Europeans, Chinese.

The machinery is as follows : \u2014 I have the honor to report, that notwith standing the rush to Mountain Creek no visible change has taken place in the number of the population of this division, which may be considered as settled. On the Scandinavian Lead work is carried on with the same energy and perseverance as it was formerly, and in general the miners are well remunerated for tleir labors. As the work progresses the amount of water to be contended with gradually decreases, which enables the miners to work the ground to more advantage On Rocky Flat Lead there are at present twenty-seven frontage claims in full work, giving employment to over 200 miners. The number of shafts bottomed are in general highly remunerative. In most claims the depth of wash -dirt is from 18 inches to 2 feet. The following is the number of tons crushed by the machines for the month of February (principally cement) : \u2014 The general opinion of the miners is, that the lead takes a turn from Nos. 12 and 13 West towards Gibraltar. In conse quence of this supposition the ground iu this direction is being taken up in three -acre blocks, by parties of eighteen men to each block; this area is allowed on conditions that the ground will be worked efficiently with steam machinery. Kangaroo Flat. \u2014 This flat at present supports a mining population of over 40U, most of whom seem determined to make this locality their home for a length of time. The greatest difficulty the miners have to contend with here is, the present scarcity of water ; with a copious supply of this necessary element, there is no doubt but this flat would support for many years double the population at present located thereon. A lease of five acres of alluvial ground has been applied for this month convenient to Mount Greenock, and adjoining the north end of the lease mentioned in my report for the month of December last. Quartz Mining \u2014 In this branch of mining considerable activity at present prevails. Iu numerous places throughout the division pros pecting is carried on to a great extent. In consequence of a few very promising reefs having been opened within the last few months to the east of Mount Greenock Creek, this portion of the division is receiving the largest share of attention in the way of prospecting, and no doubt the perseverance of the miners Description.

Avoca Division. (R. English, Mining Surveyor.) From the prospecting claim. New Years Reef, six tons have been crushed, for trial, which yielded If oz. per ton ; 20 tons of stone from this claim are raised to the surface and ready for crushing, which looks much better than the six tons crushed ; the owners are confident it will yield from 2^ to 3 oz. per ton, thickness of reef from 18 inches to 2 feet, depth 20 feet; in addition to the prospectors eight claims are in full work. The population is as follows : \u2014 From No. 3 North, on the Carnabian Reef 12 tons of stone have been crushed which yielded 1\u00a3 oz per ton; the thickness of reef is 2 feet, and depth 65 feet; six claims are at work. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 From the Sydenham Reef no crushings have taken place this month; the prospectors and No. 1 South are raising stone which is ex pected to yield 1J oz. per ton ; thickness of reef from 2 to 2J feet. A few days ago a party of prospectors discovered a very rich leader on the surface, situated about one mile south-east of New Years Reef. I saw some of the specimens which looked remarkably well. The leader at present is only a few inches thick, but the prospectors entertain high hopes of shortly striking the main reef. Several claims are occupied north and south of the prospectors. Approximate value of all mining plant, From Cockatoo Reef, Cockatoo, 30 tons of stone have been crushed at Mr. Bartlemore's machine, which yielded 1 oz. 11 dwt. per ton ; four claims are at work, thickness of reef 18 inches. \u00a36300. Price of crushing (per ton), quartz, 20s. to 25s. ; cement, 20s. Depth of rain-fall (per meter) at Avoca for the month ending 28th February, 0'07 of an inch. From a claim situated between the lease of five acres applied for by Mr. Charles Vogler, and that of ten acres gran, ed to Messrs. William Russell and Company on the All Nations Reef, 16 tons of stone have recently been crushed which yielded 19 dwt per ton ; the reef is from 5 to 6 feet in thickness, and is at present worked at a depth of 80 feet ; four men can take out 6 tons of stone daily. The population in alluvial mining since my last month's report has slightly decreased, in consequence of several rushes near to Hind's Station having occurred, which I find are on the St. Arnaud side of the boundary line, therefore cannot include the numbers in my report for the month. In a day or so, I will forward a plan and sections of Nuggety Gully, connected with the end of Ballaarat Hill, as shown on plan No. 1 of the month of October last. The population at these diggings is yet daily on the increase, the great attraction being the new rushes some few miles north of the present workings. The gully when first opened was very rich, numerous nuggets were found varying from 1 oz. up to 30 lbs. weight. At present it supports a population of about 200 (principaly puddlers). At Mountain Creek the deep lead does not progress so rapidly as might be anticipated, the impediment being that at a depth of sixty five feet in a strata of drift, overlying the schist formation, water has been struck.

Several prospecting claims in the immediate vicinity have recently been applied for one of which, from appearances, promises to be the precursor of anotht-r important rush, situate further up the creek and a mile distant from and running parallel with the present workings. This lead commences at the base of a gap in the ranges, the character of the ground being similar to the other workings : water for washing purposes is now being fast exhausted. Whilst treating upon the subject of water supply, it may not be out of place to remaik that this portion of my division, from its natural configuration, is admirably adapted to store an almost incalculable amount of storm water- the immense available drainage area, together with its elevation, render it a work easily accomplished at a trifling cost. Several prospecting claims in quartz have been applied for in the vicinity of Ked Bank, and the surface indications are in favor of many being found auriferous. Red Bank Diggings, South, commonly called Grumblers' Gully, is yet the scene of active mining operations ; the workings since my last report have increased considerably in width, but in consequence of water having been struck has not extended proportionately in length ; large heaps of wash-dirt are lying awaiting the wet season. The charge at present for carting to the place of washing is 10s. per load, with not an over-abundant supply of water there. Portions of this working are paying well, averaging 3 oz to the load through the whole of some ciaims, with a foot thickness of wash-dirt ; a confluence of this lead with that of Red Bank Diggings, North, commonly known as New Year's Flat, must eventually take place. The Pyrenees Reef (as shown in my plan last month) I have visited lately, and from the rich specimens obtained, I am of opinion that a highly auriferous lode has been discovered. The underlay of the vein, so far, is at an angle of 45\u00b0 VV. ; and as other gold-bearing leaders on the surface, running parallel, indicate a convergence at no great depth, the probabilities are, that a sufficiently thick reef will reward their labor. The vein containing gold is from 8 to 12 inches in thickness. The only crushing yet was 13 cwt. of stone, which realised 2 dwt or 12 dwt. of gold. There are ten claims working upon the course of this reef: one on each side of the prospector's have already, at a depth of 20 feet, struck what they con sider payable stone. At Red Bank Diggings, North, a large number of miners are also at work, and from what I can ascertain are all making fair wages ; the gold obtained is of a coarse water-worn description, differing much in appearance from that on the Mountain Creek side of the ranges. Three others, quartz reefs, in the same locality, have applied for prospecting claims ; but in the absence of any stone from thence having been crushed, I shall be able to give more detailed information respecting them in my next month's report. Payable ground has been found to continue in nearly a straight line with the upper part of the lead, and at a depth of 55 feet water has been struck. Several parties, after raising that element, are securing it by means of small re servoirs, made within their claims respectively, at the same time charging 2s. per cart-load of auriferous drift, for being washed. Others are constructing larger dams in adjacent gullies, with the same object only, conveying the water, after pumping, by gravitation, in an open ditch made by them, to sites conveniently selected for that purpose. Dunolly Division. (R. J. McMillan, Mining Surveyor ) The population is as follows : \u2014 Great inconvenience is felt at present by those parties ; and their works, which at this particularly dry part of the year are so necessary and important, have had to be suspended for some weeks, in consequence of the Maryborough Mining Board refusing to recommend to the Government a com- Occupation.

The table has a longer stroke than any I have seeu. The proprietor says that with two pairs of rollers his 12-horse engine can crush 20 tons in twenty-four hours. Kohong Division. (John S. Robertson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The European population of the division in both branches of mining has considerably de creased during the month, in consequence of the rush to Mackinnon's, combined with the scarcity of water in the division. The Chinese population remains the same as last month. They are chiefly located at Burnt Creek, and are paddocking out a large area of shallow wet ground there, on which they have been at work for several months. Total number of persons of all classes resi ding within the Korong division, 14,490. In quartz mining I have nothing of import- ance to report except the interesting tact that on Poverty Keef, Sandy Creek, the lode is being worked at a depth of 313 feet, apparently in- creasing in richness as it deepens. In claim No. 4 North it is over 4 feet thick, and is calculated to yield 6 oz. per ton all through. I forward sections of the abovenamcd reef in continuation of those sent last month, and re- ferring to the longitudinal section, as indicated by the numbers of the claims shown thereon, consequently they require no explanation. I beg to describe a modification of the Chilian mill now in use in this division which gives great satisfaction in its results. The bottom of the basin is formed of radiating bars placed close together, and is a grating; on the grating is a circular bar or plate of iron about 3| inches wide, on which the crushing is done; the rollers are of wood, tired with iron, of a width cor- responding to that of the circular plate on the grating, consequently the crushing surface is narrow.; a pair of scrapers are attached to each roller, which heap the quartz on to the circular plate as the rollers revolve, and two small pipes lead and distribute sufficient water into the basin to wash the crushed material through the grating. It is received in a sheet iron trough, which leads it into an iron box about 3 feet The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The number of quartz reefs proved to be auriferous ... ... 129 The number of square miles of aurif- erous ground actually worked on alluvial and quartz ... ... 25^ Aggregate value of mining plant in this division, \u00a322,500 The number of notices I have received since my last report, of parties having taken up Description.

A great and serious drawback to the de velopment of this portion of the district is. the great scarcity of water during these summer months, although with a slight outlay of ca pital more than enough could easily be stored for the year. (Charles H. Raven, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 From the station north three miles and a half a party of Germans have opened a new lead on the Union Flat; from seven tubs they washed 12J dwt. of coarse gold; the for mation being a gutter about thirteen feet wide, the high reef on the east being steep and hard, the auriferous drift composed of red gravel and hard sandstone boulders, with a little quartz, the most and largest boulders lying in immediate contact with the low reef. On the northern side of the ranges, and about four miles from Messrs. Sanderson's, a number of prospecting parties are busily at work, in some instances gold being found, but not as yet in payable quantities. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 About two miles north-west of Mr Hind's another party has secured a prospecting claim ; depth of sinking 18 feet; prospect, 10^ dwt. per load \u2014 gold coarse. About one mile south-west of Hind's a reef has been opened, but with what result I cannot report, but hope to do so more fully in my next, as also of the leads at and near Hind's, as by that time they will be more fully de veloped, and I shall also have had better opportunities of inspecting some of the claims. At St. Arnaud the reefing community are quite settled, not more than h ilf adozen having left for the new rushes. Several new reefs have lately been opened, with very good prospects. Messrs Youngson, Munch, and Company crushed three tons from the Musical Reef, which gave 6\u00a3 oz. per ton ; it consists of several leaders united by sandstone, about 1 8 inches thick ; course, nearly east and west. Price of crushing from 15s. to \u00a31 10s. per ton. Since I had the honor to forward my last report a great improvement has taken place in the southern portion of th*s division, more especially near Mr. Hind's station, in the neigh- borhood of which there is a population be- tween 8000 and 9000 working miners ; and yet this number could not be taken as belonging distinctly to this division, as numbers live at New Year's Flat, and walk here one and a half mile daily, consequently these would pro- bably be enumerated as belonging to the Avoca division. When I visited this place previous to my last report, I felt sure it would be the scene of an extensive rash \u2014 it has now proved payable likewise, reaching from Mr. Hind's north about four miles. As the lead progresses towards the foot of the ranges, the quality of gold seems improving and loses its blackness ; the average yield cannot be estimated at more than half an ounce to the load, with the boulders formerly mentioned being taken out, but the quantity of wash-dirt in many places increases, some taking two or three feet. On the eastern side of the old alluvial gully. New Bendigo, Messrs. Miller, McMahon, and Company have struck at the depth of 70 feet the cap of a reef they have called the Bristol ; as they have not yet broken through it the thickness cannot be ascertained ; gold, middling coarse ; prospect of yield, about 2 oz. ; course of reef, nearly north. At the Sebastopol lease (C. T, Cameron) the work is going on in the same sleepy style as hitherto. At the St Arnaud United (C. F. Harvey) the main shaft is being rapidly sunk, and when finished, if completed in the same style, will be a credit to the contractors. At the northern end of this lease another of four acres has been applied for , by the shaft contracting parties in the former lease. Messrs.

CASTLEMAINE MINING DISTRICT. Castlemaine Division. In Quartz Mining a considerable improve ment in yield has taken place during the month, some of our reefs again affording a most decided encouragement to the persevering miner in the form of heavy finds, while many other reefs yield sufficient to clear all labor and expenses. , (Thomas Lawrence Brown, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Nuggety Reef, at Campbell's Creek, which for above four years has produced an immense amount of 'gold continues in richness as the claimholders descend in depth, and fqr a long length of reef gold is now being obtained, the pumping machinery of the Nug gety Keef Amalgamating Company enabling the party to go below what was formerly con sidered water level. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The Cumberland Reef Company who had lost the ran of payable gold, and almcst their confidence in the reef, have by persevering and scientific mining again discovered the lode which was thrown back from its original position forming technically a slide , it is now yielding about I oz. per ton, full working operations being resumed. The Old Quartz Hill Company continue to employ above thirty men, and to keep their splendid machinery in motion, crushing about 200 tons per week; but as they are engaged in opening the mine by tunnels, shafts, and levels, everything goes to the 'mill, and the yield jp not so great as it otherwise would be in proportion to working expenses. They are now sinking two shafts, purposing to go 300 feet, which will afford a good idea' of the con tinuance of Castlemaine reefs in depth, a problem not yet solved. I have the honor to report that mining Phillips and Company, who have rented the late Bolivia Reef Company's plant, have been busily employed in opening the mine, substi tuting square for revolving stamps, and effect ing many other important improvements in the machinery. T his company consists of twenty experienced working shareholders, and there is every probability of their being suc cessful in this formerly mismanaged reef and machinery. They expect to commence crush ing operations this week. operations are at present much depressed from want of water, as per tables ; a large number of puddling machines are entirely stopped. and most of the qpartz crushing machines are wholly idle or only partially worked for want of a supply of that all important element. Instances of individual success continue to occur, the small blocks of solid ground occa sionally found reminding one of the former richness of this district. The Capper's Reef Company are not at present working, the only persons engaged being the manager and engineer. The Specimen Gully Company are also temporarily suspended, waiting the contem plated loan. A good quantity of firewood. new castings. &c, on the ground, indicate a return of activity. A party of Chinese at Golden Point found in their puddling machine a splendid quartz specimen, which yielded 1 4 oz. of pure gold. Near the Eureka Reef some good runs of gold have been followed, and within the ground now being excavated to form the Dinah Flat Reservoir, heavy gold has been obtained, but like other finds on these old diggings is the result of luck, (colonially speaking) as many miners who have been working the site for The Fortuna Company's machinery is erected, but cannot be started until a supply Europeans.

The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Eureka Company's extensive claim and powerful machinery continues ih statu quo. The shareholders having expended their money in opening the mine and erecting such superior plant, it appears exceedingly strange that they should suspend operations just as they were getting into good working order, and when to all appearance they have only to excavate the stone and run it through the mill to realize their anticipated profits. The manager gives no reason for suspension of works. The Wattle Gully Company have not yet completed the erection of Vivian's patent puddling machine, and which, if completed, could not be regularly worked until a supply of water is obtained. The Golden Point Company have com pleted the erection of their machinery, and will commence crushing next week, when further returns are expected from the Burns and Welcome Reefs. The continued dry weather has begun to affect very materially the puddling and sluicing interests. It is to be hoped, however, that this will be about the last year in which the want of the limpid element will be very considerably felt. A much greater quantity of rain falls, that may be easily collected, than can be possibly required for the use of a much larger extent of mining than is carried out at present, so that it is very evident that storage of water will be one of the great means of keeping a prosperous population en the older alluvial gold mines for many years to come. There has been no new discovery, in my division, during the month, either in alluvial or quartz mining. The various tunnels which are being driven into the Basaltic Hills. of Holcombe, are pro gressing fast, so that soon, I hope to report some discoveries in that locality. The mania which existed in this neighbor hood some months since, for quartz mining and prospecting, has subsided to a very great extent, still there is\" no decrease in thenumber of quartz miners. Very few of the claims are yielding anything over wages. The majority of the quartz lodes, in this district, are irregular in their formation, and consequently require considerably more pros pecting than better defined reefs. The tunnelling interest throughout the whole district is in a very prosperous state, and large quantities of gold are being extracted. Our mining companies are about in the same state as during the last month, except the Windlass Hill Company, which has recom menced operations, and are making a profit. The Jerron's Reef is again at a standstill, this time from want of water. The Sebastopol Reef continues to yield its weekly return from the old claims, and during the month additional claims have proved payably auriferous on both north and south continuations. This reef has long been one of the richest and most regular in yield in the division. The Wattle Gully Reef maintains its regular and payable character, and. like the Sebas topol, is looked upon as a bank from which the claimholders can draw at pleasure.

No material change can be said to have taken place in our mining population, for, al though most of the races have been dry durin g the last month, and sluicing consequently at a standstill, still occasional showers may now be expected, and in the meantime the several patches of ground these last months opened in the vicinity of Boots have been sufficient to induce most parties, by want of water out of their regular employment, to remain in the division. The Kangaroo Crushing Company has com menced work with twelve heads of stampers, and is doing well. This company has reduced the price of crushing to 12 s. person, and make a profit on that price. The Eldorado Company's prospects are de cidedly improving ; they are making a small profit on a produce of 3 dwt. to the ton. Surely if this can be done, many thousands of our miners may be profitably employed by capi talists. The additional steam engines mentioned above are all in a forward state of erection, and in most\u201e instances the ground held by the respective companies is sufficiently known to merit the sanguine expectations of the shareholders. Associated mining in Victoria, like every new thing in any community, requires time to settle itself into a regular business. The Alliance Company's plant has been purchased by Messrs. McTavish and Co., of Castlemaine, who have applied for a lease of 4 acres of quartz on the Mopoke Reef. Applications for leases have also been made by Mr. Thorburn, for 6 acres on Kangaroo Hill ; and Mr. Cook, for 2J acres, in the same locality. Quartz mining has not, during the last month, showed any decided improvement, at least I have had no information worthy of special remark. The old reefs in Jim Crow still produce gold in payable quantities, but no decided results have yet been arrived at in a number of claims in my last report mentioned as prospecting. About Boots a number of reefs cropping out on the surface have this last month began to attract the notice of the alluvial miners in the surrounding gullies, and companies are com mencing to be formed for the purpose of pros pecting the reefs in the vicinity. On the Wombat Eeef, Wombat Hill, the Cornish party is still doing very well, but the two parties adjoining both north and south are engaged puddling the surface of their claims, and are also, I am informed, doing tolerably well. About 300 feet on the same reef at the northern point of the hill has lately been taken up by another Cornish party, who I hope will be attended with better success than their pre decessors.

On Emeu and Adams Reefs work has not yet been resumed, nor is such in my opinion likely to take place before efficient machinery has been erected on the ground, and to gain this end the different companies intend en larging their number of shareholders.

On Mauritzian's Reef Messrs. Harris and Company are, I believe, the only persons working, and I have heard of no crushing from this reef during the month worth men tioning. On the Welcome Reef, Connell's Gully, both Villard and Company and the Pioneer Com pany have shown no signs of activity during the last month ; but on Nuggety Reef, also at Connell's Gully, the prospecting claim in par ticular is as usual being briskly worked, and as usual paying very well. On the Beehive Reef, Dry Diggings, where, for some short time, the yield had been de creasing, I, some two or three weeks ago, saw stone being brought to grass that bade sau* to rival anything yet produced On Parker's Specimen Reef everything is at a complete standstill, but the original Dry Diggings Company have lately applied for a mining lease of the ground where thousands and thousands of pounds have been produced, and where gold has been traced even below the water level, and I trust ere long to see at least that portion of the reef as lively as ever. In Yandoit matters as far as prospecting for quartz reefs is concerned, have been as tame as during January. I have no doubt that shortly a reaction will take place, but in the meantime a kind of un certainty hangs over the place that cannot help showing its depressing influence on business in general, and it is a strange sight to see a lo cality, lately so animated and where claims were so eagerly sought for, now almost deso late and deserted. On Old German Reef, German Gully, the Rotchildt Company, I believe, are in a forward state of formation ; and the Goldsmith Com pany, on the same reef, are only waiting for a shower to fill their reservoir to commence crashing On Trogish's Reef, the only claim being worked, the prospecting claim, has lately changed hands, and although the last crushing only yielded about 12 dwt. per ton, still the present holders believe that even at that rate they shall be able to reap a profit. On Glamorganshire Reef a patch of good stone struck now and again serves to keep a few claims going, but the majority of claims are reserved under the privilege of registration, for want of means or excess of water. On Hamburg Reef the prospecting claim is still maintaining its name for productiveness, and the adjoining claim south, although not turning out as well as before, is still paying handsomely, but the rest of the claims are registered, and will not in my opinion be pro fitably worked unless by a large company with the aid of powerful machinery. On the Pioneer Reef matters have not, with the exception of the prospecting claim and four or five more, been so lively as usual ; but the Great Reef Company's pumps are now in full play, and I hope their influence will soon be manifest on the whole line. The Great Keef Company's machinery seems to work admirably, but I have not been able to learn the results of the crushings of their own quartz ; in fact, I believe they have hitherto only crushed several heaps of refuse stone left on top by the former claimholders. On New German Keef. \u2014 The reef has been prospected to a depth of 140 feet in the prospecting claim with more than ordinary good prospects, at different levels, and I understand that the claim is about changing hands, for a sum of \u00a31000. The parlies at both ends are down to water without any prospect, but are still in excellent spirits, and intend erecting whims to enable them to carry on their prospect farther. In puddling and sluicing no noticeable change has occurred. The water supply hus almost uninterrupted been sufficient for pud dling, and even sluicing of low ground, but the principal races have during the month been dry. This circumstance has not, however, seriously affected the prosperity of our mining population, as in most cases a sufficient supply for a puddling mill has been procurable, and and although in ordinary cases these mills, iu point of efficiency, saving of labor, and amount of work, cannot compare with sluicing, still the miners in this division being generally speaking more settled than anywhere else I have seen prefer the staying at one place, even for a comparatively small remuneration, to the un certainty of fossicking about, the more so as we now are advanced so far into the dry season that, until the winter regularly sets in, occasional showers may reasonably be ex pected. The reservoir in Wombat creek is now rapidly advancing towards completion, and I trust that when other portions of the division have been equally well provided for we shall then know no abatement in the different branches of mining industry during the dry season. I have not, during the past month, heard of any extraordinary yield obtained by puddling or sluicing, but believe I may safely say that good steady wages may be considered the average. In tunnelling I have no news of importance to communicate, no new ground having been opened ; but even as matters stand, I have every reason to believe that parties engaged are doing very well. I cannot name any particular locality as being the most favored, for all the principal basaltic hills are pretty well occupied, and those few claims taken up afresh during the last month have been all over the division. On Italian Hill, Wombat Creek, Messrs. Francesco, Ceresa, and Company have applied"], [82, "72 MINING SUEVEYOES' EEPOETS\u2014 FEBEUAEY. east of Jim Crow Creek, at the foot of Scotch man's Gully, will shortly, I expect, be ready for active operations, the engine of the com pany being nearly completed, and judging from the prospects obtained splendid returns may be expected. Messrs. Carmichael and Company and McKay. Leith, and Company are also busily engaged erecting their machinery, and alto gether that portion of Yandoit looks extraor dinarily busy The Grand Junction Company have ex perienced some difficulty in sinking their prospecting shaft, and have been obliged tem porarily to suspend operations. The company it is generally thought stands a first-rate chance, and it is to be hoped that work will soon be resumed. for a fresh lease of 8 acres hitherto held by the company in virtue of Miner's Rights. Between Shepherd's Flat and Yandoit a number of tunnels are going in, but the gutter has not yet been broken into, and it is as yet doubtful whether the tunnels will not be too shallow to drain the gutter completely, when ultimately attained. In the Green Hills or Bald Hills, Yandoit, a tunnel, put in years ago at a distance of rather more than 900 feet, discovered deep ground, but being about 50 feet too shallow, and the ground very wet, the ground was again abandoned. A company, principa'ly consisting of Ballaarat shareholders, have now sunk a shaft in the reef about 80 feet lower than the said tunnel, and are just beginning driving towards the gutter, intending, if any prospect at all is obtained. immediately to procure an engine and erect machinery, and there is good reason to believe that a good lead exists through the whole chain of these hills, and I therefore expect I shall shortly have to report a considerable rush in that locality. Alluvial sisking has, during the past month, been rather brisk than otherwise, although no singular piece of individual good luck has come to my knowledge. In Jim Crow this branch of mining is almost exclusively confined to the vicinity of Butterfly Gully and Blanket Flat, where these last two or three months several very good pieces of ground, although of small extent, have been opened.\" The depth of sink ing has uniformly been from 5 to 1 0 feet, and pieces of the precious metal to upwards of 32 oz. have been obtained, but here, as everywhere in that locality, has been very patchy. About Blanket I lat a number of parties are prospecting, several shafts being down 70 or 80 feet. The ground is very wet, but there is every indication of the ground being highly auriferous, and I hope that now, when a number of people are congregated in the vicinity, no slight difficulty will deter them from testing the ground thoroughly. In Yandoit matters have not materially changed since my last report. In New Nuggety Gully the lately established co-operative companies are slowly but surely progressing towards reaping a reward for their perseverance and industry, and extended claims on the same principle are now being taken up in several of the old gu'lies in the vicinity. In the old Forty-foot Lead a few parties are at work, but their chances of getting more than a living is rather limited. A rush to a fiat west of Pickpocket Hill, called Tescino Flat, and subsequently Ham burg Flat, has proved a failure A prospect was obtained in the prospectors' shaft, but the sinking was very hard and no payable prospect obtained in any of a considerable number of shafts bottomed.

The last crushings of stone from them turned out as follows, viz. : \u2014 From Steed's w-orkings, 6J tons gave 101 oz. of gold; 6j tons from Phillip, George, and Company's produced 13\u00a3 oz ; and 20 tons from Holywell and Company's yielded 27^ oz. The alluvial workings in the gullies have much declined ; there are but few tub and cradle workers to be seen. Although the Barfold district is nearly de serted there has been good proof exhibited to establish its auriferous character ; no less than eight reefs have been opened up, all producing good indications, but they have turned out to be only surface offshoots, all running out at a smalldepth.no shaft being 100 feet deep; it therefore appears that no main reef has been struck, and want of means has stopped further research. To capitalists it might prove a good field for speculation. The reefs give more encouraging marks of prosperity.

The Vic toria holds about the same thickness through out, being ten or twelve inches, and is the richer of the two in gold, but the Ashtonia is much stouter and is increasing in thickness below. There are many gullies both here and amongst the ranges nearer Taradale which have scarcely been tried, but are no doubt highly auriferous. Taradale, southward. \u2014 Sluicing on the Back Creek. The Liberty Flat Company have got up their steam engine and are making great preparations by erecting convenient buildings to suit all requirements ; also their excavations show a systematic method pursued ; it is an economy consistent with expense which em braces the greatest chance of a successful issue. The late crushings of quartz from these reefs are as follows : \u2014 From the Victoria during January, 36J tons of stone gave 18| oz. of gold. From the Ashtonia, 13^ tons gave 5J oz., 1 ton gave 1\u00a3 oz, and 110 tons gave 53J oz. of gold. The company of Italians who have been working the adjoining ground for the last five months are still persevering. Their method is the opening up a wide channel, but only washing the bottom drift for gold. They do not express much satisfaction at the reward their exertions have met with, but miners too generally dislike to make known their success for fear of encouraging competition. The tail race which these Italians have made, at con siderable cost of labor, is 600 yards long, and in the deepest part eight feet deep ; for about 200 yards of its length it is lined with slabs of wood, and further sustained by transverse pieces. During February the Victoria yielded from 3 tons, 3 oz of gold; from 1 ton, 4\u00a3 oz. ; and from 41 J tons, 80 J oz. From the Ashtonia 1 ton produced If oz , and 1 ton, 8 dwt. A crushing of one ton from a new reef named the Musquito yielded 1 oz. 6 dwt. Trial crushings from various other reefs in prospective, although not ranging high, gave good encouragement to perseverance. There have been three applications sub mitted this month lor prospectors' privileges of extended claims on new reefs in this vicinity ; one is situate a quarter of a mile eastward of the Victoria ; a second, a quarter of a mile northward of the same ; and a third, half a mile westward of it ; making in all eight dis tinct auriferous veins, discovered within an area of three-quarters of a mile square. Another party of Italians who have been prospecting a quartz reef in this locality, having found gold, applied the other day for the prospectors' privilege of a double claim. This reef is situate a mile and a quarter south from the township of Taradale. and half a mile westward of the boundary line of the sold lands on the Back Creek, and is about a mile and a quarter north-north-east from the 1 1 umboldt Reef. It is a very stout vein crop ping out on top of a sandstone ridge, and it slightly inclines to the westward; its strike bears north 1 6\u00b0 west.

The population is as follows : \u2014 Scorpion Hill. \u2014 A new tunnel has been commenced under this hill, the object being to rework the old ground. The old tunnel which was commenced some four months back, and runs under private property, is now 350 feet into the hill, but has not yet bit upon the lead of gold ; the bottom or sandstone sub-stratum is dipping into the hill ; the super- stratum is trap-rock. The party has found traces of gold in drift, but nothing in paying quantities. There can be but little doubt of a rich run of gold lying under this hill, which is a point of trappean formation, extending into the silvo rian ranges. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 At another point of similar trappean for mation (which juts into the schistose ranges half a mile further north of that last men tioned), a party of miners have sunk a shaft 70 feet deep, and found some auriferous drift. They purpose washing the earth with a horse puddling machine which they have constructed in Milkman's Gully. A site for a horse puddling machine has been taken up in Charcoal-burners' Gully, together with an acre of ground which has partly been worked before by the ordinary process of tub and cradle, but the greater por tion of the acre is new surfacing. This is close to the place where some miners obtained and crashed two tons of quartz, (some four months ago,) which yielded 2 oz. 5 dwt. of gold : and although the search for a reef has been continued ever since, (with some little intermission,) no reef has yet been found. Approximate value of all the mining plant in my division, \u00a385,000. With respect to the ordinary mode of simply sinking a shaft, and washing the bottom drift with the aid of tub and cradle ; this branch of mining was never perhaps more devoid of interest ; a few miners only may be seen in most places wherever the ground has been worked forjjold. No change has taken place in the population since my last. Of the machinery, two crush ing engines have been completed, and three are in course of erection The South Eaglehawk Company is at pre sent bearing a very promising aspect ; the yield for the month is, from 850 tons, 520 oz. of pure gold. A large portion of the stuff is old banks that has been lying on the surface for the last two years. Within the last week rich stone has been obtained from the reef at three different levels, viz. : \u2014 40, 60, and 100 This circumstance gives a dull appearance to mining matters generally, because this class of miners are usually the most numerous ; a return to old ground might seem to imply a scarcity of new fields sufficiently attractive ; but the miners' enterprise is too often checked Occupation.

The population is as follows : \u2014 The well-known Nuggety Reef is still giving considerable returns; one claim has recently crushed 235 tons, which produced over 820 oz. of gold. W. T. Millar and party have erected a battery of stampers on their claim, and are crushing the whole of the reef, which is from 5 to 7 feet wide, and giving a good average yield. The Parkins Reef Association is proceeding rapidly with the machinery. The new engine shaft is down about 90 feet. A new company has also started on this reef, under the title of the Independent Quartz Mining Association. A lease of the ground has been applied for, and preparations are being made for the erec tion of machinery. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 About half-a-mile west of Parkins Reef, a reef, named Cookman's, has been taken up by another company; their stamping machinery is on the ground ready for erection. The reef in this company's ground is 8 feet wide, at a depth of 190 feet, and averages 1 oz. of gold per ton. Some good stone has been raised in the Grand Junction Company's ground (Manton's Gully), at the back of Mount Tarrangower. Operations have been commenced, but crushing is interrupted from the scarcity of water. The Concord Company, at Sandy Creek, is progressing rapidly with the machinery; prospects from this reef are also very encour aging. A new reef has been discovered within the last week, and a prospecting claim taken up; it is situate at Pegleg Gully, about a mile north-east of the township of Maldon. An alluvial rush has also taken place in the same locality (shallow sinking), yielding from 1 to 2 dwt. per tub.

Rumors are afloat, every day, of pounds weight having been found in Fern tree Gully, but for the truth of all of which I cannot vouch ; however. I have seen a lot of very fine nuggets, amongst which was one of 10 oz ; and besides, I know many persons who were in absolute distress before they went to work in this gully, who are now very much improved in circumstances. There are 150 men at work now in this gully, so that every foot of ground is occupied. Next month I hope to be able to report more favorably of quartz mining ; both as regards companies and individual miners.

The population is as follows : \u2014 The alluvial miners of this division are very soon. 1 hope, likely to realize a higher rate of remuneration than that I have mentioned, as several prospecting parties have been out, in the direction indicated by me, in my report for November last, and the result of this pro specting is, that two auriferous creeks have been discovered ; one of them is, as far as I can judge from description, a tributary .. of Watt's River ; and the other joins Watson's Creek, at Wilson's Station, (Linton's) after running nearly south, for about four miles. I have been shown a very nice sample of gold, probably about 5 oz., that was brought in by one of the parties (Moore's) ; and I intend visiting these localities within a few days, for the purpose of reporting more fully, aud furnishing the sketch required by your depart ment. The workings in the River Yarra, which are being carried on by the Yarra Yarra Mining Company, and by Messrs. Dickson, Jobbins, and Company, at Anderson's Creek, are in nearly the same state as when I made my last report, nor have I been able to ascertain what the returns have been from these workings. I am reliably informed that the greater poi tion of the mining population of the Bri tannia gold field have moved to Starvation Creek and its tributaries, leaving but about thirty miners behind, who are scattered about between the Little Yarra and Yankee Jim's Creek. In quartz mining, comparatively little has been done during the past month The You-you Hill Company are, however, working as vigorously as the space at the level of their adit will permit.

A little gold was obtained from the bottom of the shaft, and the claim is supposed to contain the junction of the Main Lead and the Ding Dong. The next claim is the Allandale, and con sists of 1 6 acres, of which Calvert and Com pany are the proposed lessees. The shaft is bottomed on the reef at a depth of 114 feet, is worked by an 18 horse-power engine, and a party of 16 men. This claim is supposed to contain the junction of the Main or Raglan anil Garibaldi Leads. It is situated close to the Police Paddock, in which the shaft would have been sunk had it not been a Government reserve, and immediately adjoins the township of Beaufort. The Argyle Lead is being re-worked by Chinese, and has yielded them several nuggets, besides a payable quantity of fine gold. Mr. Cook's Lead which was opened about twelve months ago, is paying the prospectors remarkably well, their shaft is about 60 feet deep, is worked with a whim, and yielding them a dividend of about \u00a312 per man, per week ; there are three other claims in work on this lead, one worked with a windlass, one with a whim, and the third with a four horse power engine, and yielding from 10s. to \u00a31 a day to each shareholder. The junction of this lead with the Main or Raglan, will be either in the Marco Polo, or Fiery Creek Company's claims, between this lead and the Ding Dong, a few claims are still working on the Old Red Streak, yielding but poor returns. The Ding Dong or Cornish Lead commences in about 70 feet sinking, and the four whim claims above the prospectors, are yielding as nearly as I can ascertain about 1 J oz. a week to each shareholder. The pros pecting claim has been a very good one, and has given an average yield of about \u00a39 per week to each shareholder.

Raglan Division. \u2014 But little change has taken place since the date of my last report, that little being caused by the disturbing in fluences of the rush to Mackinnon's, which has taken away many of the shallow sinkers on the one hand, and the attraction of the deep leads at this place\u2014 which have brought fresh accessions of population from the adjoining district of Ballaarat\u2014 on the other. The Leads. \u2014 The old Main Lead is being advantageously reworked by some 300 Chinese. Lower down, the Raglan Company have bot tomed on the reef at 73 feet. They are work ing with a 14 horse-power engine, and have already obtained payable gold. Immediately below them is the prospectors' claim: it is being worked with a whim by a party of 9 men, and a dividend of \u00a35 to \u00a36 per man per week is the reward they are reaping for the re-dis covery of this long lost lead. The next claim belongs to the Marco Polo Company : they bottomed about six weeks ago, and obtained a prospect of about 1 dwt. of gold to the tub with 3 feet of wash-dirt. There are 12 men in this party, holding 80 feet a man frontage to the lead, and they have just erected a 12 horse-power engine. The next claim is the Fiery Creek Com pany's. The party consists of 24 men: they have sunk two shafts to a depth of about 100 feet, but have not yet got the gutter. The next claim, the Golden Age, is bot tomed on the reef at 110 feet. It is being worked by a 10 horse-power engine, and a The West of England claim, between the prospectors and the township of Beaufort, has not paid wages, and the ten horse-power engine by which it has been worked, is about to be removed to Garibaldi Lead. The prospectors of the Garibaldi Lead bottomed a shaft some time ago at 114 feet, and obtained sufficient gold to allow them a prospect claim ; they work with 1 8 men, and a 1 2-horse-power engine, and have just dis covered a rich gutter at a depth or 124 feet. From the fact of Jock's Lead above this having been lost for the want of machinery, the Garibaldi is supposed to be a continuation of Jock's, and is likely to become the favorite lead of the district, although for want of machinery and population, only two claims are taken up at present ; this lead adjoins the town ship of Beaufort on the south side.

Several small rushes have taken place at Sulky Flat, Unity, and Charcoal Gullies during the month, but without any important result.

This lead is like the majority of small leads in this locality, very short and patchy. A large area of ground which could be worked to advantage during the rainy season, is now standing, owing to the almost total want of water. After mature consideration, I am fully convinced that a large number of small reservoirs, carefully distributed through out the district, would tend materially to in crease the yield of gold. The miners are so poor, although they are allowed to take up large areas of ground, they have not the funds to erect dams of suit able capacity.

Very large yields of goldcon tinue to be taken from the cement, one parcel of 20 tons, yielded nearly about 30 lbs of gold. This auriferous ground, which is very patchy, is being traced in the direction of Glenorchy. The ground applied for on lease, by Glenny and party, is within one mile of the pros pecting claim.

Campbell's Gully.- \u2014 The workings in this gully are now almost entirely abandoned owing principally to the want of water. A great deal of surfacing ground exists in this locality and when the rainy season sets in I have no doubt the puddling operations will be resumed with profit. Quartz mining in this division has not been pursued so spiritedly as the importance of such an occupation would warrant, and this may be attributed to the ill- success of several of the large quartz companies in other parts of Ballaarat. From the apathy exhibited in the opening of reefs in this division and the un systematic manner adopted in the prospecting of the greater portion of those opened, little is yet known as to their paying nature, and in consequence thereof, very few capitalists aie willing to embark in this branch of mining. The European population engaged in alluvial mining has not in any degree been increased since my last report, nor do I an ticipate any diminution in the few who are actually engaged in that branch of mining in my division The want of water has materially reduced their average weekly returns, as you will perceive in the above returns of horse puddling machines idle, but the alluvial miners generally revert to the old system of tub and cradle, for which they always find a sufficiency of very thick water which enables them to keep possession of their claims, anti cipating an early fall of rain.

No. 3 Division. (Thomas Cowan, Mining Surveyor.] The population is as follows : \u2014 Quartz Mining \u2014 The returns of the several companies mentioned in my last month's re port are still very encouraging, and in fact. have established those companies as first rate speculations ; shares are held firmly, very few being disposed to sell and two or three in stances have come under my observation, of parties leaving for a temporary trip to Europe, being offered as much as five hundred per cent. on the original outlay for their shares, and would not dispose of them, preferring to appoint a receiver for their dividends until their return. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The engines mentioned in my last . (in course of erection) have got to work, but not having stopped to clear up as yet, I could not ascertain any results. The British United Miners have purchased a 25 horse-power engine, which they expected delivered on the ground very soon. The Monte Christo Company has been yielding very much better during the past two weeks than at any former period this year, their returns being, for the week ending Saturday 2nd March. 40 ounces, and \u00a322 10s. sterling for crushing for other parties. The only crushing company idle for want of water is that of Sim and Company, now called the Majestic, and from the very ele vated position of their machinery '.nearly on the top of the Black Hill) I am not at all surprised; in fact, none of the remaining com panies have a really efficient supply. I beg to forward you herewith plans and sections of the Red Streak and Old Gravel Pits Leads Since my last report some excitement has occurred in my district by the alleged dis covery of a new method of amalgamation, by which a very much larger quantity of gold can be obtained than by the methods now in Within the past week considerable attention has been directed to Mr. Porter's invention, or application of a former invention, to the ex traction of gold from the tailings of crushing machines. Several of the companies on this gold field have since experimented with most astonishing results. The first trial of the Black Hill Company gave a yield equal to 60 oz. to the ton, but from several experiments since they attribute this large yield to the process extracting gold from the pores of the retort, which had been some time in use. use. The new process is that known as Porter's patent, the details of which must be already familiar to you, as it has been the subject of comment and explanation in almost every journal in the colony. Briefly, the process consists in passing vaporised mercury through dried tailings or sand in a close retort, and the inventor claims by this means to extract the whole, or nearly the whole, of the gold which has been lost by the amalgamating processes ordinarily employed. Great difference of opinion however still exists as to the value of the discovery, as the numerous experiments both here aud else where show a wide difference in the results obtained. The yield of the Wellingtonia Company (not in my division) by the same process was equal to 4 oz. 18 dwt. to the ton. The Majestic (late Sim and Company) 1 1 oz. 4 dwt to the ton. Experiments are still being proceeded with by several companies, of which I shall inform you next month.

If it be true, as I have reason to believe, that the vaporised mercury will take up the gold whether as a vapor or in cooling, the direction in which future researches should he carried on has been indicated, and even though Mr. Porter's present plan should not be a success, it is very probable that another based on the same principle will be found to give better results. tailings or sand is obtained, it still remains to be shown that the process can be carried out with sufficient economy of time and labor to render it profitable. At the present time I may state, that nothing has yet been fully proved. Not a single ex periment has been made, \u2014 -the whole of those reported in the public journals, or which may have come under my own observation, having been on too small a scale, or proper care not having been exercised to ensure that no gold was present in the quicksilver or the retorts employed. As I have already remarked, the evidence at present is very conflicting, as I have no means of ascertaining the circumstances under which the various experiments were made, but I con sider the process to be deserving of attention, and worthy of a much better trial than it has yet received. Mr. Porter is however now- engaged in making a series of trials, the results of which will doubtless go far to settle the value of his discovery, but until those results are obtained, I consider that the invention may still be con sidered in a state of uncertainty . In alluvial mining I have nothing new to report, the various companies in my district still continuing to obtain about their average dividends. Having taken some pains to collect authentic accounts of the various trials made, I find it somewhat difficult to decide upon the con flicting evidence. Experiments made with small quantities of tailings (lOlbs) made by the Wellingtonia Gigantea and Old Canadian Companies within my district, gave very favor able returns, and they used a new retort and fresh quicksilver. Similar results have been obtained by other companies, but all agree that the process is one that requires a great deal of time and labor, whilst the loss of quicksilver is said to be very large. The fact of a great deal of gold being lost by the amalgamating processes now in use by our various quartz mining companies, has lately been made rather promineut. The Eureka Cement Company recently had an assay made of their taiUngs, by which a return was obtained of seventeen grains of gold to 130 lbs. of crushed quartz. This result has led the company to seek for some means of saving a portion at least of the gold that now is carried away with the water, and they are making a trial of Manuel's amalgamator. The result of the experiment is not yet known. Experiments made by the Port Phillip Com pany at Clunes, the Black Hill Company, and several others, have not residted so favorably, notwithstanding that an equal amount of care appears to have been exercised. In quartz mining operations I have nothing new to report ; the works are being carried on with unabated energy, but the results obtained show no variation from those already re ported. In some claims a depth of 200 feet has been reached, but the quartz appears to preserve almost about the same average rich ness as at a less depth. It is self-evident that the loss of quicksilver might be readily avoided, and it would there fore be unfair to set down as a fault of the process, what is the result of bad manipu lation, defective apparatus, or sheer care lessness. It remains however to be shown, \u2014 1st. That vaporised mercury will take up all, or a large quantity, of the gold ; and No. 4 Division. (Michael O'Malley, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 2nd, Whether the process can be practically used at a cost sufficiently low to make it profitable. The first part I consider to be proved, be cause Mr. Porter himself has obtained results almost conclusive on this point, and also be cause several companies in my own district have obtained gold under circumstances which precluded any being present in the apparatus or quicksilver. With respect to the second point, I am of opinion that nothing has yet been proved as to the cost of work. The experiments have all been on a small Occupation. Europeans. Chinese.

Deep Leads, Frenchman's. \u2014 The Cumber land, Durham, and Cornish Company have worked out their claim, or at least the gutter portion thereof ; and a new company composed, I believe, of the working shareholders of the old company, have purchased the machinery and plant, with a view of trying or prospecting the reefs, which in many instances are found to pay fully as well as the gutter. And also of working an adjoining block claim taken up by the working shareholders some time since, and through which it is expected another lead runs, which is likely to junction with Frenchman's, on the ground of the Nelson or Working Miners' Company ahead.

Approximate value of all mining plant in the division \u00a341,750. Cost per ton for crushing, \u00a31. It will be seen by the above tables which I have the honor to forward in connection with my report for the last month, that there has been latterly a decrease in the number of alluvial, and a small increase in the number of quartz miners, as compared with the number given for the first two months of the year. The decrease I consider attributable partly to a want of water in many portions of the old shallow diggings, and partly to the fact of some of the claims occupied at Sinclair's Diggings, Log Hut, during the month of January, having been recently abandoned And the increase has been, no doubt, caused by the great ex- citement and mania for quartz reefs and tail- ings, which have been recently evoked by the extraordinary results obtained under Porter's system by several companies, from small parcels of tailings. So great has been the run on quartz tailings all over the district that several enterprising and adventurous miners on Ballaarat finding all the abandoned or available heaps in the immediate neighborhood had been already taken up, betook themselves some '20 or 30 miles into the outlying portions of the district in search of the precious piles. And tiuly, if anything like, or even a tenth of the returns generally obtained on a small scale from the tailings already tested, could be cal- culated on from the same description of tailings Porterized in large quantities the piles referred to would be precious acquisitions indeed. But as yet it remains to be proved whether or not the treatment of quartz tailings on a large scale in the manner proposed by Mr. Porter. can be practically turned to account ; however, the result of the experiment which he is The Nelson and Working Miners' Com panies are still steadfastly persevering, en deavoring to work their way through the fourth rock which is so very hard that drills sharpened and tempered in the most approved manner, become blunted before a sensible impression is made on the stone ; the manager informs me that on one occasion lately he used uo 16 drills in sinking a four inch bore. And what is still worse, when the bore is eventually sunk to the required depth (generally from 20 to 24 inches) and duly charged, &c , the quantity of rock cut in some instances is not much more than the quantity of powder used ; cannons, or in effectual blasts being quite frequent. These companies however, with all their difficulties will soon reach the gutter, as each is now down about 350 feet and the probable gutter depth not more than 360. What appears most strange in reference to them is, that though down to the same level in both shafts, which are only about 1100 feet apart, the Working Miners' Company, most to the dip. are pumping at the rate of 440 gallons per minute, while the Nelson Company are getting only about 70 gallons per minute.

West, which was abandoned by most of the shareholders and subsequently found to present such pros pects to those remaining as made the others anxious to return and claim back their shares, about which, however, there will be some difficulty, as, prior to the return of the original holders the shares had been applied for by other persons in accordance with the provisions of the local bye-laws. The Alston and Weardale Company, Craw fish Lead are engaged opening out a level to drive for the gutter, which is expected to be about 500 feet from their shaft. So that in all probability it will be four or live months before they reach it. The Scottish and Cornish Company, Black Lead, after having lost the run of the gutter in their claim about five months since, owing to its taking an abrupt turn southward, instead of, as was expected, continuing its course west ward, have recently succeeded in getting into it again, but will not be able to test its quality for a few weeks at least, as I understand they are, as usual, troubled with a large body of water which they fancied they had succeeded in darning back, but which it appears has found some other outlet or passage through the rock immediately overlying the wash-dirt, and now threatens to be as troublesome as ever ; in fact it is apprehended by some of the share holders that they will be obliged to procure larger machinery, an expenditure which, under present circumstances, would press heavily on the majority of the company. The Prospectors are engaged in the erection of an engine, having found the water too heavy for windlass operations, and are pretty confi dent, judging from the prospects obtained, of having a long reach of paying ground within their claim. The width of the gutter where crossed by them is 50 feet, and the auriferous drift is 4 feet high. Nos. 1 , 2, and 3 East are still persevering but have not yet reached the gutter. Still farther eastward, about midway between the Log Hut and Bunninyong race course, a surfacing claim has been lately taken up with a view of experimenting thereon according to Porter's system. It had been previously tried by the ordinary sluicing and puddling pro cesses, but owing to the extreme fineness of the gold, and scarcity of good clear water, it was not found remunerative under either, though it is generally believed paying gold exists, but how to save it is the difficulty. Wliim Hob s, Little Hard Hills, &c\u2014 This district of late has been remarkably dull \u2014 most of the miners have betaken themselves to other places presenting greater attractions ; but as usual, very likely many of them will return at the commencement of the rainy season to their old winter quarters. The late Progres sive Company's claim has been taken up anew by a second company, who are about giving the ground a thorough searching ; but as yet they have not commenced underground opera tions. Quartz Reefs. \u2014 Staffordshire Reef. \u2014 Except ing the Mentor Company's ground, this reef has been rather poor in point of yield during the past month. The Oriental Company has had only 24 oz. from 220 tons but latterly the appearance of the stone has been such as to justify the expectation of a much better yield ; the best is found at a depth of 80 feet, and, in the opinion of experienced miners, should yield an ounce per ton, provided nothing was wrong with the machinery. At the Little Hard Hill, two or three small companies have been this time back getting excellent returns from the cement, which is met with pretty generally in patches here and there all over the hill at a depth of from 10 to 15 feet from the surface and immediately over head the pipeclay bottom. As much as 2 oz. per ton has been obtained by burning and hand-pounding or crushing ; so that if proper mechanical appliances were available and the ground worked in a systematic manner, there is no dnubt very satisfactory dividends would be the result, even though the stuff should not yield one half the amount quoted. I bebeve it is the intention of one company to erect a small battery of four stampers as an improvement on the present primitive mode of hand-crushing. The Comet Company, for some considerable time past, has been in receipt of excellent dividends, generally about \u00a3 15 per man weekly; but, during the last month, they have only obtained 32 oz. from 150 tons taken from two shafts, one 70 and the other 90 feet deep: they are, however, presently erecting a whim on the southern portion of their leasehold, in order to work a very promising lode 4 feet thick (and ldcely to get thicker) lately struck at a depth of 170 feet, from which very good prospects Paddy's Gully, Bull Dog Hill, Moonlight, Break-o-day, &c, are presently abandoned to"], [97, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 MARCH. 85 and specimens have been got, and from which a yield of at least 15 dwt. per ton is expected. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Mentor Company (Porter and Company) have been doing unusually well during the month ; 1 5 dwt per ton being the average yield obtained from a vein 8 feet thick, struck at a depth of 170 feet in the northern portion of their ground, abutting on the leasehold of the Comet Company, The ground of the late New Homeward Bound Company has been recently purchased by the Mentor Company ; but as yet the necessary legal forms have not been effected, aud therefore the claims remain unworked. From claim No. 10 South excellent prospects have lately been obtained ; the reef is 7 feet thick ata depth of 1 00 feet, and is expected to yield about 1 oz. per ton. No. 14 South also looks very well ; specimens being numerous and good. Moreover, a new company has just taken up the adjoining ground, No. 15 South, in anticipation of the success of Porter's system, from which great results are generally expected, but especially in this neighborhood On the deep leads in this district no change of importance has taken place during the month ; those companies that have reached the respective gutters having been steadily at work, with similar results to those reported in my last. Another new claim has also been occupied during the month on Moonlight Reef, adjoining the claim of the Great Eastern Company, from whose tailings a yield of nearly 18 oz. per ton was obtained by Mr. Porter in one of his first experiments ; but it is fair to add, the quantity experimented on was only 3\u00a3 lb., which yielded 1 1 gr. ; and, I believe, in some experiments made by the company themselves, on small parcels of tailings, as high as 1 5 gr. was got in one instance from one pound and a half, and 9 gr. in another instance from the same quantity. In quartz mining some little excitement has taken place through Mr. Porter's experiments on the tailings, and most of the companies who have reducing plant in this district have been making trials with various results ; but from the small quantities tested (although a large per centage of gold has been found in most cases) it remains yet to be proved whether the process can be carried out in such an extensive way as to be remunerative. The Imperial Company, Hiscock's has re alized a somewhat better return during the past month, having obtained about 240 oz. from the usual monthly crushing of 600 tons. No. 5, OK BUNINTONG DIVISION. The Standard Company, Hiscock's, has crushed but little, in consequence of the con tractors for raising the quartz having stopped work. (James W. R. Pringle, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 From the One and All Company. Hiscock's, I have been unable to obtain any information for the month. The All Nations Company has been idle for some time past, through an insufficiency of quartz, from some portion of the mine having fallen in.

The workings in the vicinity, namely, those on the Italian Gully and Monkey Gully Leads, are doing exceedingly well ; no other part of ths district returns more gold at present. The Perseverance Company, White Horse, are engaged in erecting their new engine of 25 horse-power on their claim, and hope to be at work iu about six weeks. No particular event besides the discovery alluded to has occurred in this locality within the month ; and I may observe that no interval of equal duration has passed for the last two years so barren of noticeable incidents in con nection with mining as the past month has been all over the district. There are two batteries of stamps being erected in the district, one on the Hard Hill, and the other on the River Leigh, about one half mile west of the Hard Hill, for crushing cement and the refuse from the different pud dling machines in the neighborhood. At Browne's the population is nearly nume rically divided between alluvial and quartz mining ; the former has considerably declined, and the latter has always proved so fluctuating in its results as to discourage all large invest ments. The large reservoir for a water supply for 60me portion of this district is now nearly finished, on which I shall report more fully when completed. At Smythe's matters present no new feature, except the Great Western Claim, which was paying so magnificently high at the date of my last report, having considerably fallen, though it may be still accounted a good paying claim. No. 6 Division. (John Lynch, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 At Lucky Woman's, the North American Company have been swamped out for a few days, but by incessant baling the water has become greatly lessened. They got up a little wash-dirt, which looks exceedingly well, gold being thickly visible in it. The Centaur Company, adjoining the North American, broke into first-rate ground, which seems to be falling into the North American Claim. The Albion Company have bottomed much too shallow on the southern reef, which shows that the Ivanhoe gutter runs northerly, and probably into the Don Juan Claim. These are the only changes that have transpired within the month at Lucky Woman's. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 At Linton's the claim of the Little Wonder Company was the only new ground opened within the month. It is situated near the junction of the Black Ball and Standard Leads. The company divided \u00a323 per man for the first week after having fairly set their ma chinery in order. Further on is the Edinburgh, Duke of Corn wall, and Atlas Companies. The former has been washing for several months back, but with very poor results, a circumstance which I attribute to the wash-dirt being spread over a wide expanse after the junction of the Black Ball and Standard Leads. New auriferous ground has been discovered near the east fence of Clarke's pre-emptive right, and south-west of the Black Ball Lead. The ground is shallow and dry, and dipping in a northerly directiou. From the limited ex tent already explored, I cannot precisely say whether it bo a patch of wide spread distribu tion, or a regular lead. The Duke of Cornwall and Atlas Com panies, as well as the Pioneer Company, work ing within Linton Fence, have beeu lor a long time back driving for the gutter, but as yet without success.

(John Lynch, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Beaumont Company, which adjoins the last named, generally average about \u00a310 per week per man. This has been from its com mencement one of the most steady paying claims on Smythesdale. The Caledonian Company, next in succes sion, are realizing very good dividends ; the wash-dirt in this claim has never been particu larly rich throughout any great extent, but there has been a very good height and width of it, which compensated for the sparseuess of the precious metal. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 On the township of Smythesdale, the Britannia, Morning Light, Perseverance, .and Surprise claims still continue their usual re turns, without any marked deviation : their works are now so far extended as leaves no doubt of the greater portion of the flat on which these claims stand being remunerative. Scarsdale. \u2014 The Washington Company have reported the discovery of a tributary lead running into their original claim. They made affidavit of the discovery, and obtained an ex tension of ground under the mining regula tions. They make about \u00a310 per man a week. The Cr\u0153sus, near the latter, have been for some time back doing very well, but the gutter where they worked latterly has attained too low a depth for the drainage of the mine being effected with advantage, so in order to facilitate that, they commenced a new drive from the shaft at the required level, and are engaged in it at present. The wash-dirt of this claim gives about 8 oz. to the machine. The close of the month left the general mining interest in this division in as prosperous a condition as any it has attained at any former period of its existence. This status is the more satisfactory on account of being exclusively maintained by those claims long in esse, with out any material augmentations from fresh sources. The general expectation has long turned towards several claims in various parts of the division, which have been for months back in the ultimate stages of progress, that they would have arrived at fraction ere now, but from various unforeseen causes they have contributed nothing yet towards improving our escort returns. The Lord John Rnssell and Lord Palmer ston claims are yielding about the same. The Sugar Company, Billing and Company, and the Rip Van Winkle Company, at the north of the Black Hill, are all sinking for a new lead, and the depths at which they have at present arrived in blue rock, leaves no doubt of the existence of a lead. These claims to which I have alluded, and which I hope to be enabled soon to include in the auspicious category of paying claims, are the Magna Charta, Monkey Gully; Cleft of the Rock, Spring Dallah; North American, Happy Valley; Atlas and Duke of Cornwall, Linton, &c, and as these comprise large areas upon well known rich leads, the contribution of their quota to our present receipts will prove, I trust, an imposing accession. The Black Hill Puddling and Sluicing Com pany have suspended operations, the trial they have bad afforded no encouragement for per severance, so they stopped, and advertised the claim and plant for sale. This has been the second failure in connection with this claim, and demonstrates that extensive puddling and sluicing operations in this part of the district is a doubtful venture. The Homeward-Bound Company, which re ported a few weeks ago the discovery of a, paying new lead from the eastern base of the I have taken an abstract from the books of the Great Western Company, on Warren's Lead, Smythesdale, and I find that from the Occupation.

The claim is now abandoned. hold ; this has been the poorest end of their ground ; they get from \u00a33 to \u00a34 a man per week. The Havelock is permanently good ; \u00a3 1 0 to \u00a3 1 5 per week has been so regular an average for better than 1 2 months back, and the state of the ground and the conditions of their ope rations are so uniform, that they confidently look forward for the same returns for eight or nine months to come. The Golden Gate, which gave very flatter ing hopes some time ago. has lately dwindled down to \u00a33 to \u00a34 per man weekly, but they are now driving in a direction opposite to that in which they found the good ground at first. The Smythesdale and Browne's Junction have struck a little wash-dirt, but are not yet into the depth of it. The Prince of Wales, which abuts on the southern boundary of the latter, is stdl better ; they got \u00a330 per man some weeks. The Bute Company have not yet bottomed, but are very near it. The Cambrian is the next claim, and ap proaches the Havelock in the aggregate of its yield more than the Prince of Wales ; \u00a310 a week may be quoted as their reward The Reliance Claim has begun to pay, se veral washings gave about 10 oz. to the machine; the average depth of wash-dirt is 4 feet It is largely intermixed with black sand and wood remains. The Mines Royal Company have suffered a reduction in then dividends for a few weeks back ; their receipts are now about \u00a33 per week. The Red Hill Company are nearly in the same position. Italian Gully \u2014The Star of the North and Emeu are getting moderate dividends. Ihe Kossuth and All Nations generally make about \u00a35 each weekly. The Prince of Wales is decidedly better than either ; their returns seldom fall below \u00a310 a week. The Waterloo, which has been long worked without success, has shown some evidences lately of becoming remunerative, although its proceeds can only be estimated as comparatively improving on past trials. Finn's Quartz Reef is about seven feet wide, aud yields about 4 dwt to the ton Between this and Clarke's fence another reef has been struck which promises well ; there is a great quantity of cement which pays well for crashing. Spring Dallah and Lucky Woman's.\u2014 The Grand Trunk Shaft is 120 feet deep. The Hand-in-Hand are sinking a new shaft by contract; they have passed through 60 feet of rock, and expect to get clay at the depth of 76 feet: they have fitted up a new engine, and are engaged in the erection of two puddling machines in connection with it. Browne's. \u2014 The United Browne's Company are working on the Contest Lead. I believe it is very poor, but they manage to dispose of very large quantities of it every day. They have a large extent of the North Briton Lead still unworked towards the north-west extremity of their ground, which is expected to be very rich. The Try Again Shaft is 80 feet. The Cleft of the Rock have their whole mining apparatus in order, and will be able to commence washing and puddling very soon. The Grand Junction is making fast headway with then shaft. The Grand Junction Company are sinking a new shaft, and carrying on work in the old one ; they manage to make good wages, but no more The Recompense, at Budgeon's, has improved lately ; for a long time pre viously it was not paying the current rate of hired labor. The Robin Hood is uot bottomed yet; shares have risen in value here lately. The old leads and shallow ground, and sur facing ranges, are entirely in the occupation of the Chinese. The British have bottomed too shallow, but are now near the proper depth. The Centum have got a first-rate prospect, and arc fitting up machinery. The Success and British Workman's quartz claims on Mullocky Point arc turning out 10 dwt to the ton. The Victoria, on the con tinuation of the same reef looks very dubious. On the Britannia Reef the claim of McCauly and Varty has realized over 2 oz. to the ton by the last crushing. No definite estimate can be at present formed of the value of the other claims above and below it, works not being sufficiently extended. The North American are still unable to reduce the water sufficiently. After several days baling they succeeded in getting up a machine full of wash-dirt, which returned 19 oz, nor can this yield, though highly en couraging, be taken as a criterion of the quality of the wash-dirt, as the greater portion of it was reef, and what is designated in mining parlance mullock. Monkey Gully. \u2014 'Ihe Falcon Company are now working the northern end of their lease- After that trial a fresh influx of water put an"], [101, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 MARCH. 89 end to their operations, and it seems they have no alternative now but to take out the present pumps and replace them by others of larger bore This will entail much loss of time, which is a severe infliction on a company who have repeatedly suffered through mishaps caused by insufficient machinery. The Pioneer Company, in Linton's Paddock, is driving away towards the east, in quest of the lead which the two last named companies believe to have found in quite an opposite direction. To the south of the Atlas a lease of 50 acres has been applied for, under the belief that the lead takes a westerly direction. The Criterion and Tam O'Shanter Companies are blocking out and getting well paid. On the old gullies and shallow patches pud dling machines and horse whims are employed, and the owners of them are in general doing better than the majority of those who have ad ventured in more deep and expensive mining. The Ivanhoe have suspended operations for some days past, through want of water for puddling ; this cessation has caused a stagna tion of the works in the neighborhood. The Albion have opened out a drive ; the gutter lies between their shaft and that of the Don Juan Company, adjoining. The latter company are 103 feet through the rock. Carngham \u2014 The several claims on the Snake Valley Lead are doing well. The pay ing ground extends to a greater width than was at first supposed, so that for a long time to come they will continue to give good returns. The Lucky Leasehold, situated east of the two last-named claims, stands well for the Linton and Lucky Woman's Leads ; then shaft is down 1 40 feet in the rock. , The Magnum Bonum, United Miners, and General Picton Companies, on the Rock Lead, are doing very poorly. Several smaller companies occupy the shal low gullies around spring, Dallah, and the Happy Valley Ranges : \u2014 The Cairngorm are down about 180 feet in the rock. There is still an immense quantity of water in this shaft. Linton. \u2014 A company lately took up the old ground of the North Star, on the Standard Lead, and are now making regularly \u00a310 a week of it, with a prospect of a long duration. Only two companies continue to work the quartz reefs. The Carngham Reef has shown a great im provement by the last crushing ; 8 dwt. to the ton was the return. The Flying Buck is nearly worked out ; they will have cleared over \u00a3 1000 per man. The Glamorgan have got into first-rale ground on the Standard Lead. The Britannia Reef turned out, for the week ending 16th March, 122J- oz., which gave 6 oz. 8J dwt. per man to each of the shareholders for that week. This is the claim in which that melancholy disaster occurred, whereby four men lost their lives through the collapsing of the shaft and drives. The Redan are sinking a new shaft on the Black Lead, at the western end of their claim. This lead \u2014 the first deep lead worked on Lin ton's \u2014 has been all throughout very poor. Several companies, after trial, abandoned it ; only two persevered, namely : the John Bull and Redan ; and although it never averaged more than 3 oz. to the machine, they were able, by good management, to make that pay- Preston's Hill maintains undiminished the high character which its productiveness long since earned for it. The Little Wonder are dividing \u00a320 per week. The Edinburgh, adjoining, have not yet declared a dividend, though washing up for many months past. I attribute this to the wide expanse over which the wash-dirt was spread at the junction of the Black Lead and Standard Lead, which takes place at this precise place ; that is, between the shafts of the Little Wonder and Edinburgh Company's. Creswick Division. (James Stevenson, Mining Surveyor.) The poptdation is as follows :\u2014 The Duke of Cornwall have found out that they were driving under the wash-dirt. They penetrated upwards a distance of 20 feet and struck what they believe to be the main lead ; they also found a hopeful prospect. The Atlas Company have just began to puddle, but as they are not properly into the main gutter yet the produce of their washing is likely to be small. Occupation. Europeans. Chinese.

The machinery is as follows: \u2014 In Bullock Gully the prospectors and ad joining party are doing well. Coulson and party have bottomed their shaft, but from the quantity of water in the ground were obliged to temporarily suspend operations until they erect machinery. On the Red Streak three parties are working ground which is, in some places, paying well ; another company is sinking a shaft, and an other is in course of formation to work the ground ahead on the course of the lead. At Bullarook, the Werribee Fly Company have struck the continuation of the Rocky Lead ; the depth of the shaft is 80 feet ; the prospect obtained is at the rate of 1 dwt. to the bucket. The Hard Hill Crushing Company have crushed for themselves 470 tons of tailings, Sec, which yielded 75 oz 12 dwt. 12 gr., being an average of 3 dwt. 5 \\S, gr. per ton They have also crashed 83J tons of cement for other parties, which yielded 64 oz. 5 dwt. 2 1 gr. The Enterprise Company have crashed, of tailings, &c, from the 26th January to the 22nd of March, 490 tons, yield 88 oz., or an average of 3 dwt. 14 Jfj gr. per ton ; they also crushed, in the same period, 1 68 tons of ce ment for Dunn and party, yield 78 oz., being an average of 9 dwt 6 f gr. per ton. The Little Wonder Company have crushed 125 tons of tailings, yield 35 oz. 2 dwt. 12 gr., average, 5 dwt. 14 i gr. per ton. This com pany is enlarged and is about to erect a larger engine and battery. The Bald Hills Lead continues to pay as well as formerly ; owing, however, to a scarcity of water at the beginning of the month, some parties have not washed their usual quantity of stuff. The Friends of Freedom Company lost their shaft through insecure timbering, and have since abandoned their claim, portions of which have been taken up by the Garibaldi Company ; this latter company are erecting machinery for the more efficient working of their claim. The Friendship Crushing Company have crushed 680 tons tailings ; yield 40 oz., or an average of 1 dwt. 4 ,47 gr. This yield is con siderably below the averages generally ob tained at Creswick, and will not pay The company intend removing their machinery, unless the yield shortly increases. are The Frenchman's Quartz Company were idle at the commenement of the month caused by a short supply of water. They have crushed from the 20th to the 30th March, 120 tons of quartz ; yield, 59 oz. 1 1 dwt. 9 gr., giving an average of 9 dwt 22 J gr. per ton. At Graham's Hill, Longpoint, Holschier and party's claim is one of the best on this hill, and is in shallower ground than any near it ; it seems to be on a platform, and at either end of it the ground dips about four feet. Their wash-dirt averages 1 0 oz. per machine ; otjier parties are averaging 6 oz. per machine. On Quilliam has made a trial with his model of his Patent Amalgamator. The trial was on a small scale, but was so far very satisfactory ; it was made on quartz taken indiscriminately from George's Reef, which yielded, under the ordinary process of stamping, &c , only 4 dw-t. per ton ; but when crashed and passed through Quilliam's Patent Amalgamator, yielded at the rate of 5 oz 12 dwt. per ton It has a great advantage over Porter's process in being very simple aud capable of getting through a much greater quantity of tailings at a small cost. the eastern side of Creswick's Creek, opposite Graham's Hill, three parties are getting pay able gold. At Ironstone Hill, Slaty Creek, those par- ties that were getting gold continue to keep up an average yield as formerly. During the month three other parties have struck payable gold ; this will stimulate others who have been hanging back, to go earnestly to work, and I have little doubt but that a run of gold will be traced from this place towards the head of the dividing range in Bullarook, \u2014 a distance of at least two miles.

As regards alluvial mining I have little to record ; the great cost of prospecting in this neighborhood, to sink through the trap rock, has deterred the miners from a succession of attempts to speculate on opening new ground ; yet there is every probability of as rich leads existing as have been heretofore worked.

Porter's patent for the extraction of gold from quartz tailings, has been tried by this company, with no favorable result. I am in formed that gold was just perceptible in the retort after the tests, but not sufficient to defray the cost of the loss of quicksilver con sequent on the operation. They have dis charged the patent as impracticable and not needed, their present amalgamating apparatus being fully sufficient for seeming all but finite particles. The quantity of stone crushed dur ing the past week was 705 tons, the largest quantity ever reduced in the colony within the same time and power. The No. 4 battery crushed 192 tons in 102 hours. Victoria Company have cut the lode before worked by them, supposed to be the Eastern Reef, from a level opened at 335 feet, by a drive east of 175 feet from the upper level. This lode has an underlay of 1 in 1 , although where last cut it shows a tendency to assume a more perpendicular course. It is unusually hard, and the water is heavy. The contract for cross-cutting this reef has been let at \u00a335 per fathom, 7 feet high 6X6 feet, which, however, is not likely to pay the miners, on account of the volume of water which impedes their present efforts. The level at 275 feet is now dry, and the raising of metal will be re commenced next week, also crushing opera tions. Clunes Quartz Mining Company. \u2014 The works on the Welcome Reef are at present dis continued ; they have driven upon the lode northwards 255 feet from where it was cut, at which point a break was met with. The course of the lode has been due north and south, but its continuation has not been attempted to be discovered, as the company have had other necessary work to perform in the meantime On this reef the company have a reserve of 60 feet in height of stone opened out for stoping down. The width of the reef has averaged from 10 to 12 feet; in places it has proved to be 18 feet wide. The stone has throughout promised good yields, but it has not been separately tested. On Robinson's Reef, which still looks well, they are driving from the south engine shaft to open into the work ings of the south whim shaft, to drain the water off, which had prevented paying opera tions by a too abundant quantity of water. The Eastern Reef still supplies the greatest quantity of stone ; no deviation or, peculiarity is noticeable in this lode. The foundation of New North Clunes Company have put down their shaft 200 feet in a satisfactory manner. The cistern plat is nearly completed ; they will be able to sink other 50 feet with the whim. The dam for the supply of water to the winding engine is 100 square feet by four feet deep ; it has been formed with the earth raised from the shaft, but will require to be lined with clay puddle \u2014 the material for the purpose is close at hand. The poppet heads are ready for erection, and the general arrangements of the company are complete. The mining engine is being made on Ballaarat : it will have a 20 inch cylinder, the boiler will be 8 feet diameter and have 114 multitubular tubes, with fire-hole 3 feet in diameter ; the plunger lift will have a 12-feet slroke, pipes 12| inches diameter. This engine will bottom the company's shaft to 600 feet, and drain the mine."], [104, "92 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 MARCH. out east and west. I can scarcely doubt but at this depth that the known lodes will be cut, and possibly fresh veins of auriferous stone met with The size of the shaft is 7 feet 6 inches by 4 feet ; this is considered too small for the work to be carried on, but the centre braces have been removed 7 inches to give more room for the pumping gear. The late tests of the lodes in the claim showed 7 and 8 dwt. of gold per ton ; which yield, considering the width of the reefs, from 8 to 1 0 feet is a guarantee of success to the proprietary with good management. Criterion Company have crushed during the past four weeks 856 tons of quartz which yielded 284 oz. 4 dwt. 1 7 gr. of gold. I have before alluded to the simple plan adopted by this company for guides to their iron lifters at the crushing mill, the wooden blocks only require to be screwed up-once a week ; they have lasted eighteen months, and years may elapse before they may be required to be replaced. The insignificant first cost over the first outlay for the brass \"v\" guides is not the only re commendation, as the wooden guides are found to have less friction and cause no perceptible wear on the lifters ; on the other hand, com panies using the more costly appliance, have found it necessary to have their iron lifters laid with steel. I may note that the Yankee Company have adopted this plan and also commend it. Alluvial mining is at present a secondary interest in this place, the companies working on the southern hill are earning from \u00a33 to \u00a35 per man weekly. Quartz mining on this part of the reefs, has not as yet been successfully carried out ; yet from the auriferous character of the alluvial dirt, evidently washed from the contiguous reefs, which is of a depth of 14 to 16 feet, I draw an inference that the southern reefs may hereafter prove as valuable as the northern continuations from the Clunes Com pany's paddock. Robinson's Reef, with the Criterion Com pany, on the 160 feet level, is only 9 feet wide ; at about 30 feet above, it was nearly 30 feet wide ; it at present shows indications of widen ing out. It here deviates from its usual east ward underlay as much as 4 feet in 6 f. et west ward, with no present sign of any alteration. This reef has frequently been intersected with bands of \" barren quartz,\" which run perpen dicularly ; this company appear to be now crossing an impoverished band by their lessened yields. Gohdon Division. (J. B. Cusack, Mining Surveyor.) Clunes United Company. \u2014 At a level of 150 feet they have struck the eastern reef by a drive of 51 feet from the shaft, they are not through the lode yet ; the appearance of the stone is of a satisfactory character, and they have therefore returned to widen the drive to allow of two lines of tramways being laid down for conveyance of quartz to the engine shaft. The stone they have recently crushed has been raised from Robinson's Reef, the yield has averaged oz. per ton ; during the past month dividends have been paid of \u00a33 5s. and \u00a310 per share. With a continuance of good management this mine should prove as good an investment as any in the district.

They have not been working at the lees during the month. In All Nations Gully, one party who have a surface claim on the side of the gully are erecting an 8 horse-power engine for puddling purposes; there are no other parties working in the gully at present, except a few fossickers scattered about. The Kangaroo Company have six men working on the Kangaroo and Hick's Reefs; from the former reef they are taking out a few tons from various depths, between 20 feet and 150 feet, for trial ; if the results are satisfac tory, they intend taking the water out of their deep shaft (190 feet) and sinking deeper; on Kick's Reef they are taking out quartz from two levels, 50 feet and 200 feet respectively ; at 50 feet deep the reef is 15 inches thick ; at 200 feet it is 2 feet thick ; they have not crushed any quartz from the reefs lately, in the meantime they keep their engine engaged recrashing the old quartz tailings (by the old Chilian mill process) which yield 2 dwt. per ton ; this result defrays the expenses of the company while they are developing the reefs. Blackwood Division (Thomas Hay, Mining Surveyor ) The population is as follows : \u2014 All other mining operations are suspended on Gordon. Mount Egerton, Rose Company (Little Hill Reef) are raising quartz from levels 80 feet, 100 feet, 130 feet, and 145 feet respectively. The reef does not appear to alter its width downward; but from the main shaft, where it is 15 feet thick, it narrows considerably south ward. They have crushed some of the lately raised quartz, which yielded 8 dwt. per ton. Their machine is principally engaged crushing old refuse quartz and mullock (clay and sandy slate). They have also one battery of six stamps let to crush tailings at 7s. 6d. per ton. Their machine will crash 150 tons of quartz per week, or 300 tons of tailings. They are working 16 stamps at present, and have a space for another battery of 6 stamps which they intend to erect soon. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Big Hill Reef. \u2014 This reef, with the excep tion of one claim, is now in the possession of Messrs. Reid, Burrell and Company who have their machine situated in a gully about 7 00 yards from the reef. They have a main shaft sunk to a depth of 185 feet, and instead of going deeper at present, the}' are driving at 86 feet deep ; the reef at this depth is 50 feet thick. They crushed 42 tous from the east side, taking 15 feet thick of the tees; this yielded 16 dwt. per ton. At 35 feet deep, and south from the main shaft they are taking out the whole body of reef (15 to 20 feet thick) which yields 8 dwt. per ton There having been some addition made to the steam power lately by two companies, the approximate value of all the machineiy would now be \u00b119,700, and the steam power about 1 1 0 hor^e. Quartz Reefs.\u2014 The operations in this de partment of mining during the month generally have not been very active, particularly where water-wheels are employed, and this ari-es fiom an insufficient supply of water, and in other respects fiom making extended openings in the mines and preparing more powerful machinery. In some instances, however, good results have been obtained. From No. 3 claim (not belonging to Reid and Company) the party have had 36 tons crushed taken from a depth of 150 feet, which yielded 25 dwt. per ton.

They have since my last re port opened a mass of quartz, not only yield ing a profitable amount of gold, but of an extraordinary thickness, no less than 33 feet, and apparently all crushable to profit. This is found in a small dingle called Back Creek, but the strata here is evidently irregular. Newman's Reef \u2014 The prospecting claim has had another crushing, but the yield was small, barely J oz. to the ton. This is not a paying produce with from 4 to 5 miles cartage.

The Simmons Reef Quartz Mining Company is now composed of some fresh shareholders, and they are beginning with a capital of \u00a35600, in thares of \u00a3100 each, all taken up. From the well known character of this mine, and the practical experience of the manager in mining matters, where skill combined with judgment and judicious management are likely to be guiding elements in the conduct of the adventure, coupled with the fact of their being now engaged in erecting powerful and effective crushing machinery, I look forward to this concern becoming the leading one in this locality. Hewson's Reef. \u2014 The parties on this reef are engaged in erecting additional stampers, and driving a tunnel to drain the mine. Alluvial Diggings. \u2014 Very little has been done in this during the month, water being very short. Those of the claimholders that are at work are storing wash-stuff until water comes I cannot omit naming a rather lucky cir cumstance which befell a poor digger, who on a Sunday earlv in the month went into Long Gully to look for some sluice boxes which had been carried away by a recent and sudden flood. On walking through the bottom of the gully he saw something blight, and on stoop ing to pick it up. he found that it was stuck fast in clay, and he could not disengage it with his hand ; he however soon found means to do this, and to his surprise found it was a nugget of gold 18 oz. in weight, and upon searching about found another of 7 oz. I cannot vouch for the exact weight of the nuggets, but that nuggets were found ap proaching to this weight I have been credibly informed. The Cornish Company, for want of water, have done but little during the month. Appleton Brothers have been at work steadily through the month, and are realizing profitable returns. Trewhella's Reef \u2014 Although I am not pre pared to state the exact yield on this reef from the unwillingness of the companies to commu nicate details, I am enabled to say that the yield generally has not been satisfactory. The Pioneer Company's has been under i oz. to the ton ; a good deal of their time, how ever, has been taken up in sinking \u2014 they are in hopes of retrieving their lost time.

Wallan and Rossiter's crushing machine is erected. In Bowman's Forest, the German Lead, with the exception of two or three claims, is being deserted. The rush also to the new lead in Paddy's Gully has subsided, the prospecting claims abandoned, aud it is only the upper part of the lead, which runs from 10 feet to 30 feet deep, lhat is now being worked ; it has the same drawback that is complained of in the other leads of the forest, in being so very patchy The miners from these leads are pro ceeding to Lambing Flat, while others are returning from that place and settling down again in their old districts, such as the Wool shed and Reid's Creek, finding a much more steady and certain produce in these diggings than to the rushes that periodically take place. In the other parts of my district they are doing steadily and well, the great want at this time of the year being of course water. When the rains set in, an increase of the miners will take Water becoming every day scarcer during the month, a number of claims in both di visions have been obliged to stop work also a few wh *els are idle for want of motive power. Parties are looking anxiously forward to the completion of the reservoirs now in course of erection in the Yackandandah division, as a source ot supply for their wants. An immense body of w-ater could be advantageously em ployed in both these divisions for years to come, more particularly during the summer months. The Pioneer Company have only three (3) heads available at the present time, but ex pect a large increase on the advent of wet weather.

The population is as follows: \u2014 Several of the alluvial claims on Morse's Creek are also paying well, and others are being bought up by the Chinese for sums, the amount of which leaves little doubt that they are payable. Water, for sluicing purposes, is plentiful throughout the division. Quartz mining continues prosperous, and there have been seven new reefs registered during the month, named and situate as fol lows : \u2014 Ranklin's Reef, situated half a mile north of the Oriental ; the Home Reef, situate a quarter of a mile north of the Pennyweight, \u2014 on this line three claims are occupied. The Canadian. \u2014 This reef is situate on the western side of Morse's Creek, opposite its junction with Growler's Creek. This is a large reef, but as the prospectors have scarcely bro ken any quartz, I am unable to report on its prospects. They are driving a tunnel to strike the reef at some depth from the surface, The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Enterprise, which is situate on the eastern boundary of Messrs. Richardson's prospecting claim, has been taken up by that party. They have not struck any payable stone at present, but are sinking on the vein. The Black Ball is a small vein which has been discovered about a quarter of a mile S. W. of the Elgin. 'Ihe surface quartz has a promising appearance. The Scandinavian is situated between the Oriental and Mead's Reefs. At present there is no defined reef, but a large body of surface quartz which appears of very good quality. Brenkmann's Reef\u2014 This reef, which is the most promising struck for some time, was accidentally discovered by a party of Germans who were visiting the abandoned Lisbon Reef, and who, finding a specimen, commenced prospecting the adjacent ground. They ulti mately struck a body of quartz about 40 yards east of the Lisbon, and on sinking a few feet, came on a well-defined reef between two and three feet in thickness, with gold abundantly visible throughout most of the quartz. A portion of the population at the present time must be reported as unsettled, several parties having left for the rush at Gaffney's Creek ; in consequence of this the above re turns are only approximately correct. During the month of March alluvial mining has improved considerably in this division.

Messrs. Wood and Company are driving a tunnel into their claim, with a view to cut the reef at a depth of about 200 feet. In the present workings of this claim the reef has latterly shown symptoms of running out on the north boundary. In three stopes (or short levels) extending south about 24 feet, the reef has become so nearly extinct as not to be worth working. Richardson's. \u2014 The quartz raised from the prospecting claim has been much poorer this month, but the company state that the contrac tors (who are now raising their stone) have allowed a considerable quantity of useless mullock to be mixed with the quartz, and that this has lowered the yield The reef continues as strong as ever at the depth now reached, viz., about 130 feet. In the tunnel several small leaders have been struck and it is expected that should the first reef run out. the second will be struck at the depth at which the tunnel will cut the course of the reef. No 1 South continues to yield as well as usual, and from the large body of stone raised, may be considered, at the pre sent time, the most valuable quartz claim in this division. A small parcel of quartz has been crashed from the Buckeye Beef, and has averaged 1 oz. 19 dwt. per ton. On the White Star a very good reef has been struck in the prospecting claim at a depth of about ninety-five feet ; a parcel of 24 tons has been crashed, and has averaged 6 oz. per ton '1 he reef is about eighteen inches in thickness. A tunnel is being driven to work this claim at a low level A tunnel is also being driven in to No. 1 South, and should it strike the reef, will meet it at a depth of about 250 feet below the prospectors' shaft. In No. 2 South the quartz crashed has turned out, on the average, very poor, thegood stone lately struck proving to be only a small patch This claim has been registered for further prospecting, not being payable. In No. 3 South the reef continues very wide, but this company have not yet succeeded in ob taining any quantity of payable quartz. From No. 1 North 55 tons of remaining surface stone have been crushed, but no continuation of the reef has been discovered. Falkner's (Ovens River). \u2014 About 300 tons of good quartz has been raised, and will be crushed during April. Falkner's Reef (Growler's Creek).\u2014 The prospectors on this reef have succeeded in striking the continuation of the first reef, to the northward, and are obtaining quartz, the yield of which is likely to equal any before crushed from this claim. They have not yet struck the second reef, neither have Messrs. Stephens and Company in the Elgin claim adjoining. The latter party are still sinking. Hibernia Reef. \u2014 In the prospecting claim some more very good stone has been struck in the drive south of the old shaft, and is expected to turn out 5 oz. or 6 oz. per ton. A reef about three feet thick has been struck in the new shaft lately sunk, but at present very little gold is visible. However judging from the formation of the walls which are very regular and solid, and from the general ap pearance of the ground, I believe that a good reef will be struck in this claim. From No 1 North 44 tons of good payable quartz have been crushed. Gander's Reef \u2014 Gitchell and Company have this month struck a fine reef below the water level in No. 1 South Claim. The reef is over four feet in thickness, and from the appearance of the quartz which has been raised, is likely to yield better than any before crushed from this reef. The quartz which has been raised from the prospecting claim has not yielded so well as usual, but is still highly remunerative.

It will be observed that there have been crushings from some reefs which I have not re ported the prospects of; but at present there are only very small veins, on which so little work has been done that no opinion can yet be formed of their value. From the Hit or Miss, No. 1 South, there has also been a good trial crushing. The price of crashing is now generally reduced to \u00a31 10s. per ton.

Over this width the depths vary sud denly, one hole being perhaps 100 feet deep, and \"the adjoining one not more than 60, so that the bottom could it be laid bare, would present a very irregular appearance. It seems, however, that the miners are confident of the lead continuing to run northward, as several new mills are about to be put up in anticipa tion of the workings bearing towards the Ben digo Creek. In every other locality the alluvial mining is very dull. Fifteen new reefs, separate and distinct, have been discovered, but have not yet been suffi ciently prospected to warrant details. In the ground of the forfeited lease \u2014 Bristol Reef \u2014 immediately adjoining the town of Mary borough, another rich reef is discovered, which is an additional proof of the unfairness of hav ing so many other blocks equally as favorable. and equally neglected by the lessees, still locked up from the miners.

The pumping engine has done its work well, and the claim holders of Mariner's Reef are now in a position to prosecute their work efficiently, who have agreed to pay the association as a con sideration certain dividends, clear of all ex penses, out of the returns of their respective claims, varying from one-eighth to three sixty-eighths. (D. O'Leary, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows :\u2014 However, it appears these dividends have been recently considered too small by the as sociation, which has resulted in a three months' notice being served on the owners of those claims to the following effect : '\u25a0 That the pumping engine shall be stopped unless a better consideration be given for the pumping.\" The machinery is as follows : \u2014 It is to be hoped this threat will not be put into execution, and that no attempts will be made to rectify blunders committed elsewhere, and in quite a different branch, by such extor tion from those hardworking men ; and even should matters be carried to such extremes, it is very questionable whether the association would derive any benefit from the change.

No other claims have yet struck the reef- In consequence of this difference of opinion the ground in each locality is closely shep herded, and, from the expensive and laborious nature of the sinking, it will take a few weeks to decide the question. From the prospectors' claim, New Year's Reef, 35 tons have been crushed, which yielded 1 oz. 8 dwt. per ton. The reef varies consider ably in thickness, being at present only a few inches, but the prospectors believe by sinking lower they will again obtain it of a reasonable thickness. In no other claim has the reef been found up to the present. About 100 miners are engaged in raising cement on the outskirts of the old portion of this lead. They find, with the present rates for crushing, that \u00b1 an oz. to the ton will pay, and they are certain of occasionally finding patches that will yield from 1 oz. to 2 oz. per ton. The cement is from 8 to 12 inches in thickness, and some thousands of tons could be obtained that would yield from 5 to 8 dwt. per ton ; but this is considered too poor to leave a profit, after deducting the expense of raising, carting, and crushing, and, therefore, remains unworked. The sinking is from 40 to 50 feet, and dry. The Carnubian Reef appears to be a series of biocks very much detached, at times one of these will be found in thickness from 2 to 3 feet, and to pay well, and again to dwindle down to a few inches; none but the prospectors are in possession of the reef a reasonable thick ness, which is 2 feet, and will yield from 1 to \\\\ oz. per ton. The party I mentioned in my last report as discovering a rich leader on the surface, situated to the south-east of New Year's Keef, have not as yet teen fortunate enough to strike the main reef. There is nothing worthy of note from the various other reefs. A company of twelve men (called the White Star) are erecting a steam engine of 12 horse power on their extended claim of 4 acres tak en up on the previously worked portion of the lead. '1 he sinking is from 80 to 90 feet, and a large amount of water to contend with. The plan No. 1 which I forward, is con nected with the top of the Mysterious Lead, and shows the position of the Big Hdl and liakery Keefs, Pieman's and Bakery Gullies ; likewise of a small rush on Lack Creek Flat. As regards the reefs, they were found rather poor t>i pay at the present rates for crushing, aud a few claims on each are registered. Rocky Flat Lead. \u2014 The Great Extended Company of 18 shareholders, are about to erect a steam engine of 12 horse-power on their exti nded claim of 3 acres, taken up on the supposed course of this lead. It is ex pected that shortly a large extent of ground will be taken up under the same system. 'Ihe shareholders in I\\os 14 and 15. who have a steam engine of 12 horse-power erected, have after great difficulty mastered the water, and expect shortly to reach the bed rock, where they are in great hopes of obtaining a good prospect. With reference to the small rush, the pro spectors and a few other parties are obtaining from I an oz. to 1 oz. to the load, with 1 foot of wash-dirt, but the majority of the claims are unremunerative. Union Lead. \u2014 From the great depth of basalt rock, (90 feet,) and the large amount of water to overcome, the miners have come to the con clusion that this lead cannot be worked with out the aid of steam machinery. One steam engine of 8 horse-hower has been erected during the month, and several extended claims are registered, for the purpose of giving their owners time to procure steam machinery.

At Red Bank the upper portion of the workings upon both leads are still occupied, and the shallow ground is steadily extending in width, whilst the deep sinking (wet) pro gresses very slowly. Since the late rain numbers have been employed washing up, and although no very rich ground is reported, yet, upon the whole, has produced fair average wages results The population at Red Bank nearly doubles that of Mountain Creek, and the alluvial diggings undoubtedly are of a more extensive character. The Pyrennees Reef, situate in close prox imity to these diggings presents a very pro mising appearance ; the stone now being raised by the prospectors is of a rich description, but not yet improving in thickness, and in the absence of machinery no crushings have litely been made. Upon the surface, at these work ings may be observed several outcropping quartz veins containing gold, running parallel within a few feet of each other ; the pre sumption therefore is. that at no very con siderable depth these veins or leaders will converge, forming a main and payable reef. Twelve claims only are at work, whilst several more are shepherding ; many shafts are sink ing to depths varying from 100 to 150 feet, their object being, if possible, to strike the main reef. The late rainfall has tended much to improve this gold field, but the physical topography of this portion of the district, (although admirably adapted for s 'curing that element by embankment i. is at present not calculated to retain the same for more than a sow days' use.

Depth of rain-fall at Avoca (per meter) for the month ending 31st March, was 3-10 inches. The population has slightly decreased since last month in this division, in consequence of several new rushes having occurred outside the boundary, some of which are in the St. Arnaud Division, whilst others are situate near the main line of road leading from Mountain Creek to the township of Navarre, conse quently are in the Ararat district. The old diggings at Mountain Creek during the last few weeks have been taken up and worked again with renewed energy; the cause of this reaction is that a payable drift overly ing the orginal workings has been found, which in many places is remunerative to the surface, at depths from 3 to 6 ft et. In conse quence of this new discovery, (which only exists in the shallow part of the lead, ) these workings are calculated to give employment to a large number of miners for some time to come, the yield per load being from a few dwt to 3 oz. Four Mile Flat has a population of four hundred miners, all of whom, from the im mense thickness of wash-dirt in many places, are doing we 1, washing the auriferous drift by means of puddling machinery. At the Amphitheatre a new rush lately set in ; the ground rushed was a continuation of the old workings ; in sixty feet sinking the prospect yielded an ounce of gold to the load, with a foot thickness of wash-dirt. The num ber of miners at work is about two hundred. Since my last report, a payable quartz lode near the township has als> been found; this reef is called the Slaughteryard Keef, the first crushing from which ( VVinspear's claim) yielded a little over 4 oz to the ton, at a depth of 1 5 feet having 2 feet thickness of stone.

Aggregate value of mining plant, \u00a327,000. The number of notices I have received dur ing the month of parties taking up ground for the purpose of prospecting for quartz reefs, is 29. 1 have this month registered three prospect claims for alluvial workings, two in the neighborhood of Korong, and one at Old Kingower. Two daj s' rain last week enabled the alluvial miners in Old Kingower to set to work, and although only for a short time, several nuggets have been discovered, varying from 1 to 17 oz., and mostly in shallow ground from 3 to 10 feet sinking The first situate in Farmer's Gully, Korong, the declared prospect of which was 1 2 dwt of gold from 35 American buckets of dirt. The Woolshed alluvial diggings at Korong are much in the same state as on my last re port. I cannot perceive any addition to the number of miners. The second was situate in Mosquito Gully, Korong : the prospect declared was 1 dwt. of gold per tub. The third situate in Scrubby Gully Old Kingower : the prospect declared was nugget 4 oz I li dwt and fine gold. Although we have not had during this month any of the extraordinary yields from the quartz reefs that I reported some months ago. I consider that the mines are in a much healthier and prosperous state than they ap peared to be last month ; the great exodus to Mountain Creek conveyed an impression that the quartz mines were failing. The mining population of this division has increased sintte my last report ; the increase is owing mainly to the return of those who had left this division for the Mountain Creek rush, and who are now returning to the claims which had been registered by them. The last month has however proved their stability, inasmuch as many of the claims which bad worked the whole of what is termed a floating reef, and which led to the impression that the stone had run out, have at depths varying from 10 to 50 feet below struck other reefs more permanent as they increase in depth. The al'uvial diggings which, in the Old Inglewood Lead, I mentioned in my last, now assumes the appearance of deep sinking has also attracted a good many of those who are now returning. The depth of sinking on this lead is now over 120 feet, and the yield obtained from several of the shafts which have bottomed is reported to me to be remunerative. The yields from the lower bodies of stone have in almost every case proved very re munerative, and has given a great impetus to quartz mining, and I have no doubt will be the means of having many claims now registered thoroughly tested. The cement out of this lead which has been crushed has yielded 2 oz. to the load on an average, a return sufficient to have induced a great many miners marking off claims, and who are now sinking. In Jericho the prospects in quartz mining has improved so much as to induce two parties to erect steam crushing machines on their claims. This lead is- situate about four miles west from Inulewood, on the road to Korong. and the sinking perfectly dry and tolerably easy. There are at present more than 400 miners at work in this locality. Several claims in this place are however at a stand still until they shall have completed the erection of machinery for the purpose of water baling, the old style of the windlass being found utterly useless. During the month the owners of puddling machines have almost ceased working, in con sequence of the want of water, and I think there will be very little change in this class of mining until rain sots in. At Kingower the reefs have not made much progress since my last report, and the ma chines there are principally engaged in crush ing cement, &c, obtained in Glenalbyn. Daly's Frontage Lead has had even more 'water to contend with than was anticipated, and the shareholders of the claims ahead of those who have erected machinery have regis- tered their claims, for the purpose of obtaining steam machinery to aid in overcoming the water. From Mclntyre Diggings I have received several notifications of ground having been taken up that was abandoned more than twelve months previous, and which is supposed to"], [118, "106 MINING SUEYEYOES' EEPOETS MAECH. where the wash-dirt from which they are taken does not exceed in yield 10 dwt. per load and rarely average this. The general yield per load being much poorer, a number of alluvial miners are turning their attention to quartz mining, so much so, that there is scarcely a piece of quartz on any of the ranges for miles around this neighborhood, that dues not bear evidences of the prospector ; the result of which is the discovery in many instances of reefs apparently payable, but from which as yet no quartz has been crushed. have been very superficially worked in the first instance. I have nothing new to report of the reefs in Korong. The intimation I received of a rich reef having been struck four miles north of the township of Wedderburne, and which I men tioned in my last report, has not as yet been confirmed, nor have I heard the result of their crushing. Upon the whole I would report, that the district is in a prosperous condition, and the yield of gold extracted fiom the quartz as remunerative, aud although depressions may be felt occasionally, I have no doubt of the stability of Inglewood as a gold field. The quartz from the Liverpool, Somerset and Cambiian Reefs, as far as I have seen, do not appear to me very good, the best I should think would yield about 1^ oz per ton. On the Somerset Reef, situated close to and north of Hind's Station, about 20 claims are at work, the reef on the surface in the Pro specting claim is about 10 sect thick \u2014 prospect very poor. St. Arnaud Division. (Charles II. Raven, i, Mining Surveyor.) On the Cambrian Reef they are greatly hindereel from prospecting, by the quantity of w-ater obtained at the depth of 40 feet ; most of the claimholders on this reef have grants for dams on their claims, to retain the water baled, for washing purposes. The population is as follows:\u2014 In the alluvial at Hine's Proper, but few obtain payable claims ; in some instances, and those claims few and far between, 1 and 2 oz. to the load have been obtained, but the average of the best claims cannot be estimated at over 10 dwt., and the majority do not yield more than 5 dwt to the load; when this is considered and the price of cartage, and use of toms for washing, it cannot be wondered at their seeking better results from quartz. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 \u25a0 From the quality of the alluvial gold ob tained in this vicinity, its general rough appearance and the number of specimens ob tained, I think the discovery of a rich reef or reefs in the immediate neighborhood highly probable, although not amidst the tremendous high ranges where they have hitherto been sought, but rather on the low points of the range, as they dip into the lower ground.

The population is as follows: \u2014 The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The operations and prospects of the Cum berland Reef Company have been considerably impeded by a tough sandstone horse, which required much labor to get through, and even now the reef is not so compact nor auriferous as before the slide took place. They have topped the lode at a depth us 160 feet in their engine-shaft, which not only gives them a better supply of water for crushing purposes, but will enable them to break out a larger quantity of mineral. The Wattle Cully Company commenced operations with their new machinery, which is stated to have answered admirably The di rectory have, however, suspended day labor, and are advertising for contracts for raising the wash-dirt. Very little has transpired during the past month of sufficient general interest to be worth reporting. In alluvial mining, operations have continued very dull ; the puddlers, who are the only successful alluvial miners, being partially or altogether idle for want of water ; the same cause is assigned for so many of our steam crushing machines being idle ; those working are employed on stone from the richer claims, many of which continue to yield a good quan tity of the precious metal.

The population is as follows : \u2014 Within the area are 29 puddling claims, and 29 horse puddling machines; also 1 steam puddling machine, 'these employ 135 men and 52 horses.

All of these employ a considerable munber of men ; and it is a remarkable fact that all the alluvial deposits around this line of quartz reefs have been extremely rich.

The mining population has gradually de creased during the last six months, and so scattered are the few remaining alluvial miners that it is very difficult to estimate their number. The most interesting sphere of alluvial min- ing which obtains in this division is sluicing There are four parties sluicing successfully in different places a'ong the Coliban River, immediately north of Taradale, and another party is on the Back Creek ; two more have taken up positions in a new field situate at Piper's Creek, two miles eastward of Mr. Mitchell's station on the Campaspe River. With respect to the gold discovery made on the Campaspe, north of Mitchell's, in July last, very little is doing, but a few miners are working at two places in that quarter.

The following yields have been obtained during the past month :\u2014 The North Linscot's Association has purchased an engine and is making preparations to work the mine on a large scale. Several tons have been crushed on trial, at the Atlas Company's mills, and found to average nearly an ounce to the ton On visiting the Pickpocket Diggings this week, I found that the greater portion of them were within the south-eastern boundary of the Maldon Division, which accounts for the in creased number of alluvial miners appearing in the table. I have forwarded with this, plan and sections of the remaining portion of the Eaglehawk Quartz Mining Association's ground left from last month. The operations of the South Linscot's Com pany have been retarded from scarcity of water. No returns have been made this month. The Eaglehawk Union Company has com menced crushing with the new battery of stampers which are found to work admirably. The result of eight days' crushing, from 250 tons of quartz, pioduced 67 oz. of fine gold. The yields of the South Eaglehawk Com pany are still excellent. Some fine specimens have been obtained this week; the returns made for this month have been, from 659 tons crushed, 399 oz. 11 dwt of fine gold extracted, averaging 12 dwt. to the ton. The mine is being extended north and south at various levels, and the prospects from the different workings are very promising. The Beehive Company has completed the new stack, which answers well and will, doubt less be the means of great saving in fuel. The prospects in the underground workings are improving. No returns have been made since the 1 1th inst., in consequence of the machinery undergoing a thorough repair.

Mining is still being carried on below with fair prospects. The Grand Junction Company has com menced crushing 154 tons chiefly of bank stuff, the yield from which has been 49 oz. of fine gold. The Perseverance is still idle. Returns nil. Hepeurn Division. (Ambrose Johnson, Mining Surveyor.) '1 he population is as follows: \u2014 The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Most of the claims on Nuggety Reef are still looking well; 102 tons crushed at the Atlas Company's mill last week, from the claim of Messrs Walker and Company produced 357 oz. of fine gold. Several other parties are crushing, but the yields are not yet known. Fourteen private claims on various reefs have this month been registered through want of means, the expenses attendant upon deep sinking being very heavy for individual en terprise. Very little is being done at present in this locality, from want of water, in alluvial mining. No decided improvement can be said to have taken place in the state of mining affairs iu general ; and in consequence, the mining popu lation has not during the last month been visibly affected. In crushing machinery one addition has been made, a boiler and portion of the gear having arrived on the ground to work the prospecting claim on New German Reef, lately purchased by Messrs.

Sampson and Company have concluded ar rangements lor the erection of machinery on the ground, and lately resumed operations. In quartz mining, I have the satisfaction to report that several reefs, lately opened in the vicinity of Boots Gully, are showing decidedly good. On Welcome Reef the Pioneer Company, I believe, are about winding up their affairs, aud Mr. Willard, holding the adjoining ground north, is still persevering and has lately started a fresh shaft. The Adelaide Reef, opened about 2 months has Icen prospected to a depth of about 80 feet, and the average yield throughout that depth has been about 2 oz per ton, by a width of quartz varying from 1 to 2 feet. The reef seems to be very regular in its formation, but owing to its strike southward, it is as yet only being worked in the 2 northern claims; a number of shafts, however, are going down one of iheni expected to strike the reef in about a fortnight. On New Nuggety Reef, the prospecting claim is as usually paying handsomely, but the other claims are at a standstill. On Beehive Reef, the quartz being raised is expected to average over 30 oz. per ton, but only one claim is being worked. On the other claims several shafts were sunk to various depths, but without prospects, and the ground has now for some time been abandoned. Gibson's Reef was discovered last week in an alluvial shaft, sunk in old ground in Scotch man's or Brandy Hot Gully, and a capital prospect was obtained; 12 claims have been taken up, but I have not yet been informed whether the reef has been struck in any be sides the prospectors. On Parker's Specimen Reef, about 8 acres have been applied for under mining lease by the original claimholders, aud the ground is held in reserve pending the grant of the lease and the reorganization of the company. The rest of the claims are either registered or abandoned. On Adams' New Reef, near Old Tom Gully, discovered within the hist month, a share in claim No. 2 South has been sold for \u00a3100, and the first crushing of 3 tons yielded about 63 oz. From the prospecting claim a kiln wilPshortly be crushed, and it is expected that the yield will be as good as the neighboring claim. None of the shafts have yet been sunk to any depth, but by what has hitherto been seen of the reef, or rather leader, it appears to be as well defined and properly formed as any in the division. On Sportsman's. Reef, also at the head of Dry Diggings Gully, operations have just been icsumed in the prospecting claim, where the reef when first opened yielded first-rate, but latterly only indifferent stone has been ob tained. The proprietors, however, still enter tain a high opinion of the claim, and it is to be hoped that their perseverance may meet with success. The rest of the claims are all deserted. In Yaudoit. quartz mining is gradually im proving, and slowly recovering from the leth argy caused by the many disappointments during the late rush, in most instances reck lessly began and as recklessly terminated. tin the old discovered reefs in Jim Crow proper, matters have remained much the same as usual, no extraordinary yield has come to my knowledge but on most of them a steady remuneration is being obtained. On Hoggett's Reef, Blind Creek, and Old German Reef, German Gully, no important change has taken pake during the month of March. On Melvin's Reef, head cf Blind Creek, Msssrs. Hosking and Company have got a large body of quartz, yielding on an average 4 and 5 dwt. per ton. but good patches are occasion ally met with ; and even with the small return just mentioned, having crushing machinery on the ground, a small profit is obtained. From the prospecting claim on TrogishReef the last crushing, taking the whole thickness of the reef 4 to 5 feet, only averaged about 7 dwt per ton; but even that return would paj; well if machinery was on the ground. On Todd's Reef, Tucker Gully, matters are only -slowly progressing, the distance from efficient machinery and bad roads being the principal drawback. The Wombat Reef, Wombat Hill, is as usual paying the Cornish party exceedingly well. The company's machinery having part of the time been under repair, no large amount of quartz has been crushed, but what was crushed was uniformly as good as hei etofore. On King Billy's Keef, a company has lately taken up 1600 feet of the reef, and intend erecting machinery at once. On Glamorganshire Reef, Claim No. 2 North has lately crushed some splendid quartz, the exact amount I have not been able to learn, but I have seen in the shaft small nugg 'ts of 8 or 10 dwt. sticking in the solid stone, and on the whole the gold is more coarse and solid than any I have hitherto seen in the quartz on Jim Crow. In this claim gold has been got, more or less, from the very surface; but the pio specting claim adjoining south has, after spending fivs or six months' labor unprofitable Another strong company has taken up a portion of ground north of the Cornish party's ground, and have began sinking. On Collier's Reef, I understand that Messrs."], [124, "112 MINING SUEVEYOES EEPOETS\u2014 MAECH. in the southern part of their claim, on the crown of the hill, come to the northern portion to sink a shaft, and struck the same run of gold at a depth of about 73 feet. made to procure and erect an engine on the ground. On New German Eeef the prospecting claim has been sold to Messrs. Cuthbert. Nixon, and Company, of Ballaarat, for \u00a31000, and the pur chasers have already b: ought boiler, stampers, and part of the other gear on the ground, in tending to carry on operations on a large scale. The adjoining claim south have, at a depth of 120 feet, struck quartz with a very fair prospect, but the water, immediately on touching the reef, became too heavy for hand-baling, and the party is now erecting a whim. The Glamorganshire Reef is a southern continuation of the celebrated Hamburg Reef ; and although some little time ago the Hamburg Reef was reported to have run out, still facts as the above will go far to prove to the miners that in most instances perseverance coupled with skill and discrimination, will ulti mately be rewarded, and that the success in quartz working is not depending solely on mere chance. From Hamburg Reef I have heard of no crushing especially worthy of remark Claim No 3 South has resumed operations ; they have enlarged their company and taken up more ground, and appear prepared to encounter and master all difficulties. On Old Nuggety Beef, Chance Reef, Christ mas Keef, and a number of others, parties are busy prospecting, some being down a con siderable depth, but I have heard of no im portant discovery in the last month. Puddling and Sluicing.\u2014 The season has been unusually favorable for these branches of mining Creek sluicing, almost exclusively carried on by the Chinese, has hardly suffered any interruption ; at least, the water supply generally has been such that by damming up the light water, a sufficient quantity for six or eight hours' slui ing has been ensured. Pud dling throughout the southern part of the divi sion, where the gold has been originally more generally distributed through the whole heighth of alluvium, is in a very healthy state, and the yield, judging' by appearances, wholly satis factory. As one instance, I may mention that last week two men puddling in Long Gully, Wombat, obtained 10 oz., and I am confident that such instances in several localities are not of very rare occurrence, although seldom coming to my knowledge. Parlies are now beginning to prepare for winter work, and a number of claims prospected during the summer are now being secured under the bye-laws. Welshman's Reef is again at full work, and on Homeward Bound Reef an extended claim is applied for On both reefs gold has been obtained, but hitherto not in payable quantities. On Steel's Keef, or Pioneer Reef, where until now payable gold bad been obtained in the prospecting claim and the adjoining claim north only, it is a satisfaction to learn that the Great Reef Company's engine has reduced the water so far as to enable the neighboring claims to go on sinking; and in Claim No 5 South, he d by Messrs. Nay lor and Company, the reef is lately struck at 90 feet, and with first-class prospects. The purchasers of Steel and Company's claims are intending to apply for a mining lease of their ground ; and on the whole line of reef, where hitherto most of the claims have been at a standstill under registration for excess of water, matters are beginning to assume a more lively aspect. The prospects of the Great Reef Company have materially been improved by the Meel's Reef being stiuck in Naylor and Company's claim, the company holding 120 feet north aud 360 feet south of Nay lor's The engine is busy engaged baling and winding in the engine shaft on Claim No 4, and the batteries are kept pretty constantly crushing for hire. Tunnelling is as usually favorably pro gressing, but no important discoveries, such as opening of new ground, has taken place. The principal event during last month has been the Police Reserve on Wombat Hill being thrown open for occupation under miners' rights under the bye-laws, and the whole of the ground was immediately taken up by a company of 40 men ; the formation of the hill, however, is such that in all probability about 100 or 120 feet of rock would have to be sunk through, and the water consequent upon going through the basalt would also prove no mean obstacle To work the ground by means of a tunnel would, in my opinion, be the most advantageous, but a place sufficiently low to admit of a tunnel being brought in low enough for the supposed lead will hardly be found within 1300 or 1400 feet, and you will thus perceive that the enterprise is one where more than ordinary foresight will b; required; but On Malcolm's Reef, in private property, I hear that it is intended to form a company and work the ground in connection with the Cader Idris Lease, immediately adjoining the western boundary of Dr. Malcolm's paddock, and into whose ground the reef is expected. by its western underlie, to pass at a depth of 1 50 feet, or thereabouts. The Garibaldi Company, on Malco'm's Reef, north of the private property, is reported to have crushed 12 dwt. per ton, but the ground is found too wet to be effectually worked, and I understand that arrangements are being"], [125, "113 MINING SUEVEYOES EEPOETS \u2014 MAECH. th*; party appears determined, one way or the other, to explore the long-coveted ground A lead has been found extending through Daylesford township from the head of Doctor's Gully, and several shafts bottomed in private prop *rty in the northern portion of the town ship are reported to be doing remarkably well. Seveial tunnels have 1 een started for the same lead in the southern pai t of Daylesford, and nil parties interested are in high spirits. The principal leads through basaltic hills in other parts of Jim Crow are pretty well occu pied and although no singular instance of success his come to my knowledge, t-till the general yield seems to be every way satis factory. 1 he tunnels in the lower part of Shepherd's Flat, along Jim Crow Creek, are taking more time than was originally anti cipated, but there is every reason lo believe that the miners engaged will be amply re warded In alluvial sinking I have no rashes to report. 1 >eep ground has been found in Blanket Flat, near Deep Creek ; the deepest shaft is down 130 feet, and has a considerable amount of water to contend with, but as yet no sign of bottom. From the fact, however, lhat gold has be *n found in the shallow part of the flat, and in shallow ground leading into the flat, expectations are ripe, and a considerable number of claims are marked off. although not worked with the spirit the circumstances would seem to call for. In the other gullies in that vicinity, opened during the last summer, matters are but slowly progressing, but when winter sets in, it is very likely that most of the old workings will be taken up for puddling. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 With respect to mining operations in this division during the month of March. I have the honor to state for your information that in quartz mining, with but few exceptional cases, there is at present a great want of activity everywhere. Alluvial mining and prospecting for new alluvial ground (for which there is ample scope) seems to be the favorite employment now. This state of things was initiated some four months ago, in consequence of the finding of some nuggets in Fern-tree Gully ; since which time several parties have proceeded to prospect the division iu different directions, the result In the old gullies about Yandoit a number of people are earning a living, but no heavy finds have come to my knowlege. About Pickpocket Hill a number of miners have been engaged, but the ground being mostly shallow, it is gradually being worked out. and a number are now prospecting new ground in the neigh borhood, both quartz and alluvial. of which has been the discovery of an au riferous creek by a Mr. Moore and party. between the spurs of the great dividing range and on the Varra watershed, and of two other auriferous gullies by other pai ties, one in the parish of Nillumbik, called Draper's Gully, and the other near One-tree Hill, called tha Five-mile Creek. St. Andrew's Division. With reference to Moore's Creek I have the honor to state, that from thede-cri|'tion given by Mr. Moore when he first reported his dis covery to me, I was led to believe that it was beyond the dividing range, and on the Goul burn watershed, but on visiting the locality I ascertained that it is within about nine miles of Queenstown, and from its situation and the direction of its course it can be no other than the source of Steele's Creek and therefore in the Mining Division of St, Andrew's.

As regards the auriferous character of Moore's Creek; although it is shallow ground, the depth of sinking being only from 2 to 4 feet of loose drift, resting upon a bed of pipe clay, still it is not at all suitable for sluice washing, inasmuch as the payable gold lies principally in the pipeclay, which will roll away through the sluice boxes in the form of tough clay balls, carrying with them not only the gold which they contain, but also anj' particle of gold they come in contact with as they roll along. Neither will ground sluicing pay in this place, as there is not sufficient fall (1 in 10) in the creek; but I believe that puddling machines would pay exceedingly well. However, these remarks may not be ap plicable to parts of this creek farther down. At present it is unexplored by the prospectors, the banks being covered with all but impene trable scrub, aud the creek filled with logs of huge dimensions, in every stage of decay. With reference to river workings, the only operations of the kind that are being cairied on in this division are those of the Yan-a Yarra Mining Company, Messrs. Dickson, Jobbins, and Company, and Messrs. Bleakly and party, all in the Yarra at A nderson's creek. The Yarra Yarra Mining Company have 1 5 men employed, with two steam engines of an aggregate power of 1 2 horse, for the purpose of pumping the water from their workings and washing their stuff. I am not aware what the yield of gold from these workings is, but I saw about two pennyweights of gold washed from one dish of stuff which I also saw stripped and raised in part of their workings in the bank of the Yarra. Messrs. Dickson, Jobbins, and party have 1 4 men employed, and a water wheel of about four horse power, for the purpose of pumping the water from their claim. I have reason to believe that the yield of gold to this company has not been at all satisfactory, not because there is no gold in their claim, but because of the very great difficulty of thoroughly un watering their workings owing to the flow of water through the seams and fissures of the rock in the bottom. The rock fragments found in the drift are entirely argillaceous, with a good deal of very white poor looking quartz. With reference to Draper's Gully, where there are now about 100 miners employed, I have the pleasure to state that it promises to give remunerative employment to many of the alluvial miners here for a considerable tune to come. There is this drawback, however, that a great portion of the auriferous ground lies in alienated land ; the miners will therefore be obliged to make terms with the owners of the property through which this gully runs. In the usual tub 'and cradle operations on the older workings, there is nothing to report, except that it has been rumoured about for the last few days that a nugget, weighing 32 lbs. has been found in Fcm-tree Gully. This has not been verified, but it is highly probable, from the quantity of heavy nuggets that have been found there. The sinking in this gully is through about 4 feet of black soil, and about 7 feet of sandy loam, to the washing stuff which varies in depth from 4 to 9 inches, and resting upon haid gray sandstone. The average yield of gold is about 2 dwt. to the tub ; but the ground is so very wet, that there is great diffi culty in working it iu the usual waj', that is by sinking holes The safest, and at the same time the most efficient way of work ng this ground would be to turn it over in large paddocks, extending from side to side across the gully. In quartz mining, the most important work ings here now are those of the Smythe's Creek Mining Company, at One-tree Hill. They are putting down two shafts on Swedish Reef, which I am informed are to be continued to a depth of from two to three hundred feet. One of these shafts is down to a depth of 150 feet, and the other is to a depth of 140 feet A whim is placed about midway between these shafts, for the purpose of raising the mullock and refuse to the surface. Five-mile Creek, which I have alluded to, is a tributary of Watson's Creek, and has .its junction near Wilson's Station ; (Linton's on count}' map, see sketch.) The tunnelling operations of this company are suspended for the present, both at One tree Hill and the You-you.

The lead is pointing to one of the many untried portions of this division which remain iu their pristine state, and doubtless contain large deposits of the precious metal. Several hundred holes have been marked out, and are going down with earnestness. The gold obtained from holes already bottomed is of a shotty descrip tion ; many nuggets have been obtained vary ing from i oz. to 2 oz. each.

The principal occurrences of interest in mining matters that have taken place in this division, during the month, are the discoveries of new runs of rich ground in the claims of the Royal Saxon Company, Inkermann Lead ; and that of the United Cosmopolitan and Red Jacket Company, on the Frenchman's Lead. In the Royal Saxon, the run had been traced in the direction of the north-east corner of their paddock towards the junction of Mair and Pleasant streets, where an opening between two reefs was noticed, and from the way in which the wash-dirt lying between these reefs seemed to be pitching into the Inkermann Gutter, it induced the company to continue their operations in this direction ; and after some considerable amount of work being done, for which the company have been tolerably well remunerated by their success, the con clusion arrived at, from the appearance of the ground worked, is that a tributary to the Inkermann Lead has been discovered. The company, although working on private properly, have taken the necessary steps in complying with the provisions of the mining bye laws, and have taken up a block claim ill connexion with their private property paddock. In the event of this discovery proving to be a tributary lead to the Inkermann, its source in all probability is the Cemetery Quartz Reef, and its course will be along the eastern end of Wendooiee Swamp. From the many places in which the ground has been bottomed be tween the reef and place of discovery, a Uttle to the eastward of the course pointed out, I cannot see any other possible direction by which it can meet the Inkermann Lead.

The United Cosmopolitan and Red Jacket Company have been in anticipation of striking a new lead for several months. From the nature of the ground worked in this claim, it would seem that a lead is coming in from a northerly direction ; and the company at last considering the evidences of such a fact suffi ciently conclusive, reported the existence of a new and distinct lead in their claim ; availing themselves at the same time of the advantages afforded by the mining regulations regarding new discoveries. I think it is doubtful whether this discovery can be regarded as an original discovery of a lead, although so far as the discoverers are concerned it will be the same in effect to them. My own opinion is that it is simply the junction of the Old Woolshed and Frenchman's (Sebastopol) Leads. and if sufficient funds be at the disposal of the company, some further information may shortly be expected as to the course of the Golden Point Lead.

By referring to the general plan of the mines furnished by me, you will perceive the situation of the Woolshed Lead, and judging from its general direction, coupled with the fact that the country falls pretty rapidly towards the claim of the United Cosmopolitan and Red Jacket Company, I think therefore that the opinion ventured is not without con siderable support.

The Crocodile and Majestic Companies are paying good dividends, after paying working expenses. Ricketts and Company, also on the Black Hill, have entered into arangements for the erection of machinery immediately. This company of four men occupy a claim of 52' 9\" along the course of the reef ; about GOO tons of stone are raised, and from its appearance and the ex cellent yield of the adjoining claim (the Black Hill Company) I have no reason to doubt of their enterprise being amply rewarded A puddling machine is erected on some favorable spot on the claim sufficiently ele vated to allow the sludge to run freely from the machine, and a paddock is commenced alongside in the direction of the gully or work ings, and immediately outside this road, on which the horse travels ; this is continued down to the bed-rock at an angle of 30\u00b0 to 4 5\u00b0 ; a tramway consisting of a single line of rails on substantial sleepers is next laid down. and as the work progresses along the bottom is continued with a turn-table at some con venient spot to lay by the empty truck, while the full truck is removing from the face of the cutting to the bottom of the incline; a rope is next attached to an inverted hook on the bottom frame of the truck, passing round a small drum 12 inches in diameter on the spindle of the machine, or it might more pro perly be called a miniature whim revolving on an iron pin passing through it and into the spindle, aud connected with the portion of the spindle which carries the arms on which the harrows are mounted, and joined or removed at pleasure by a simple pole or lever about the frame-work of the machine, thus putting the whim or lifting portion in or out of gear at pleasure. On the Band of Hope Reef, the One and All Company have opened a level at a depth of 126 feet, and have beeu obliged to suspend operations from the quantity of water ; they are now erecting a 13 horse-power engine, exclusively for pumping and winding, and will be about five weeks before the under ground works are resumed. I was shown a magnificent specimen of gold and quartz from a level of seventy feet, the weight being 12 oz. 7 dwt., and estimated to contain 8 oz. of gold. The Victoria Company, on the Victoria Reef, crushed about 110 tons weekly; average yield 5 dwt., which gives a fair dividend to eleven shareholders. The Wellington Company, on the Dead Horse, commenced crushing last week, and reduced 200 tons in seven days ; average yield 7 dwt. The All Nations Company are erecting a 25 horse-power engine to work twelve stamps with only two boxes ; six stamps to be worked in each box. From the above description of this simple contrivance it will be seen, that when the rope is attached to the truck at the bottom of the incline, and the drum thrown into gear, as it were, forming a solid spindle at each revo lution of the horse around the machine, the truck slowly ascends about three feet until it arrives at the level ground on which the ma chine is situate, when the rope detaches itself, and the truck is emptied by the man attending the machine. The stuff is generally washed from bottom to top, it being considered as cheap a way of disposing of the top or clayey stuff as having to remove it by barrows from the claim. A party of four men with one horse can wash about five machines weekly, each consisting of about fifteen loads of earth, at an average of | oz. to the machine, thereby giving fair wages after paying expenses. The Livingstone Company, on the York shire Reef, have been making improvements in their gold-saving apparatus, having found by experience that a large per centage of the gold was lost by an inefficient amalgamating apparatus.

In reference to the question of amalgamation great attention has been given to the best way of managing the various sulphurets found in combination with the quartz, and popularly known as \" mundic.\" These sulphurets, it is well known, are found to be a great impediment to the thorough carrying out of any system of amalgamation, and accordingly numerous experiments have been tried to get rid of them. The usual pro cess is to burn the mundic for some con siderable time in a furnace, after which it is put through the usual amalgamating process. The Fire Brigade Company have recently been making some trials of the mundic found in their ripples, and from the increased yield of gold obtained, they have reason to believe that a considerable quantity had formerly been lost. The process at present adopted by them is to bum the mundic in a furnace for about sixteen hours ; it is then taken out and passed over a blanket into a shaking table well loaded with quicksilver. The amalgum is then retorted in the usual manner. I have been unable to ascertain the exact yield of the mundic, as the experiments made have been vrith stuff taken out of the ripples, which contained some quartz as well as mundic. The result has been sufficiently satisfactory to induce the company to pursue their ope rations still further in this direction. The various quartz companies in my district are carrying on their operations as usual, and with average success. I have nothing to report of special interest, but the following details will afford information as to the nature of the work carried on. The Fire Brigade Company are working on the Last Chance Lode, and have two engines, one with 1 6 inch cylinder, and the other with a cylinder of 1 0 J inch. Their battery consists of 12 stamps. They have opened two levels, one at a depth of 200 feet, and the other at a depth of 167 feet. The thickness of the lode is 3 feet in the lower level, and from 1 to 2 feet in the upper. The Danish Company have struck a fresh lode at a depth of 220 feet. The lode is ahout 6 feet in width, and the yield has been about 1 oz. to the ton. This company recently ob tained 41 oz. of gold as the result of som- days' crashing, the quantity of quartz crashed being 100 tons. The Last Chance Company have sunk a new shaft to the depth of 150 feet. They are at present working in a level at a depth of 70 feet from the surface, as there is a very heavy body of water at a greater depth. The yield is about 7 dwt. per ton, and the lode is 14 feet in breadth. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 I beg herewith to forward you sections of the Bakery Hill and Mopoke Leads, showing the gradual fall of the ground from the shallow workings in which the leads were first struck to their junction. The sections themselves will sufficiently show the nature of the various strata. At the present time much attention is being given to the processes of amalgamation by the different quartz crushing companies within my district, but hitherto no general system has been adopted. The trials that have been made of some new methods which have been brought before the public have not resulted in any definite opinion as to their merits, and some satisfactory system is still a great de sideratum. The experiments made by Mr. Porter must still be considered as experiments only, as they have been made on too small a scale to afford sufficient data to judge of the process as applicable to large operations. In respect to this method I have nothing to add to my last report, but I may repeat, that I consider the process one that well deserves a thorough investigation. Other amalgamators have been brought under public notice during the past month, amongst which is the dry amalgamator of Quillam. The experiments made with this machine, labor, like those of Mr. Porter, under the defect of being on too small a scale. The model exhibited seems to act very well, but the quantities of tailings tried have been so small that in this case also no opinion can be safely pronounced as to the use of the machine for practical work. It is certainly desirable, that thorough trials should be made of the many inventions now before the public, but the various companies shrink from incurring the expense and loss of time which would be caused by their under taking a series of experiments.

Whim Holes. \u2014 This place is nearly aban doned at present; but if anew company, about commencing to crush the cement found in the claim of the late Heart and Hand Company, should be successful in obtaining paying re turns, the likelihood is the ground will be soon occupied again, as it appears the cement can be found abundantly down along the gully, but up to the present it has not been tried ; judging however by the excellent yields (from 3 to 5 oz. per ton) being presently obtained by two or three small companies on the Little Hard Hills, it is not unlikely that it will be found at least payable down here. On Kangaroo Gully and Mount Misery work goes on steadily, but of late the want of water has been severely felt. Long Gully is almost exclusively in the possession of Chinese ; but owing to their inability or disinclination, or both, to give in formation, nothing reliable can be elicited from these people; however one party of two men unearthed a nugget during the month, which realized \u00a378, and several other parties are reported to be doing well. Pinehgut, Break-o'-day, Paddy's Gully, &c \u2014 Two or three small companies at Pinehgut have been realizing about \u00a35 per week per man during she last five or six months, and one company of four men, at Break-o'-day, have realized upwards of \u00a3400 each within the last four months, and are likely to have many more month's profitable work ere their claim is finished. I am informed the wash-dirt is 4 or 5 feet in depth, and of considerable width; the sinking is quite dry, and only about 15 or 20 feet deep, but it is apprehended the run or lead will soon pass into the private property of Mr. Elder ; however some two or thre\u00a3 weeks more will decide the matter. Between Paddy's Gully and Mr. Cullen's fence, to the south ward, some two or three companies have been also doing pretty well in old shallow ground during the month, and expect to do still better as soon as a plentiful supply of water can be procured'; but this district is generally patchy. Quartz Reefs. \u2014 Staffordshire Reef. \u2014 The Comet Company have obtained an average yield of 15 dwt. per ton from 200 tons crashed during the month ; the stone was raised from two shafts on the northern portion of their leasehold, the respective depths being 50 and 1 r0 feet; the width of reef at the 50 feet level would average 3J feet, and at the other about 2 feet ; but as the stone from both shafts was mixed before being crushed, I cannot give the separate yields. The company have lately erected a whim on the southern portion of their ground, and have struck some excellent quartz at a depth of 145 feet; but intend sinking to a depth of 150 feet before opening out. Log Hut, or Sinclair's Diggings. \u2014 The pros pectors have nearly completed the erection of their engine, and expect to be getting up wash dirt within the current month. No. 1 East bottomed a few days since, and got a prospect of 1J dwt. per tub, with 3J feet of wash-dirt; their depth is 101 feet, and though they are not troubled with much water, still they are resolved to procure steam power to work their claim. No. 2 East also bottomed still later, at a depth of 96 feet, and obtained a prospect similar to that of No. 1 ; though the color and general appearance of the stuff in both claims are quite different, from which circumstance it The Oriental Company have obtained at the rate of s\\ oz. per ton from 350 tons crashed during the month; the stone was raised from a vein varying from 4 to 9 feet in width, at a depth of 75 feet ; the same vein has been struck in another level 12 feet deeper, and apparently improves as it deepens. The company have been of late raising their quartz with a whim. which they find in all respects much preferable to the windlass; the present price of shares is \u00a3100, though only a few weeks since they could be got for half the sum."], [137, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS APRIL. 123 The Mentor Company (Porter and Company) have crushed 450 tons during the month, and obtained an average yield of 7 dwt 9 gr per ton. The experiment alluded to in my last report, which was then being made by Mr. Porter on a half ton of dried tailings, was so far successful that he is convinced he can, wrhoui any material loss of quicksilver, extract at least double the quantity of gold from his tailings by the vaporizing system than had been originally obtained, provided a retort can be so constructed as to stand the heating and CO' ling processes without bursting or cracking. The first retort used was of quadrangular shape, which is considered the cause of its bottom having cracked ; he has however now procured one of circular shape and is just about commencing another experiment.

I have the honor to forward my report for the month of April, accompanied by the usual monthly tables. On the Durham Lend during the month the Pioneer Company has succeeded in striking the opposite rets, proving the gutter to be about 70 feet wide at the point of discovery ; the yield has been about 4 dwt. to the load. The Convention Company has opened out at a depth of about 265 sect, aud hope shortly to reach the gutter. The Telegraph and John Bull Companies are at work in driving out the gutter, with about the usual returns NO. 14 South Company have just completed the erection of a whim, with a view to the more efficient working of a promising vein, 7 feet wide struck at a depth of 120 feet ; they have already about 50 tons raised, and are negotiating with Mr. Porter for the crushing of it. On Moonlight Reef matters have been rather quiet this time back; the prospectors are the only company actually at work. The eijgine of the (ireat East in Company is presently idle pending repairs; and the claim taken up during ihe month of March, adjoining the Great Eastern Company's claim, is still held in reset ve, in order (as alleged) to afford the company time to make s me preparatory arrangements before commencing work The Great Britain and Polar Star Companies are as yet very unsuccessful in their claims, having met with but indifferent dirt. On the Napoleon Lead the Sons of Freedom Company has at length succeeded in beating the water, and work has again been resumed at the face, after having been swamped out for nearly two years T he I eviathan Company have driven nor therly from their shaft over 600 feet without striking the gutter ; latterly this company have been boring in the back f aring they might possibly be too de. p, but are again driving.

The Standard Company (Hiscock's) have not been crashing during the month, being engaged in driving and sinking to prove the reef at a greater depth. The Imperial Company has realized about 240 oz. of gold from 600 tons of quartz for the month. I have the honor to forward you the fol lowing brief report of the state of mining in division No. 6, Ballaarat, for the month of April, 1861. At Smythesdale mining affairs are in nearly the same state as at the date of my last report. The most noticeable change that I can observe is in the claim of the Great Western Company, which has dwindled down to very poor returns from the magnificent yields which every day's work produced from it about a month ago. The One and All Company has crashed about 600 tons, with an average yield of about 4 dwt. to the ton. The All Nations Company's battery has been idle a great portion of the month, not having crushed more than about 100 tons of quartz, averaging about 5 dwt to the ton. This company is engaged in sinking a new shaft, some portion of the claim having fallen in. At Scarsdale, the Smythes and Browne's Junction Company have broken into the gutter where they got over 30 oz to three machines' lull. The Bute Company has also bottomed on paying gold. These claims have revived a fresh spirit of enterprise in this quarter. The Jenny Lind Company, Scandinavian Reef, has crushed about 800 tons, at about 3 dwt. to the ton. There is nothing further to be reported respecting Scarsdale. The Golden Gate, Re liance, Cr\u0153sus, Lord John Russell, and Lord Palmerston Companies are carrying on in their usual waj-, without much deviation from their ordinary luck. The Britannia Company, White Horse, has crushed about 600 tons, with an average yield of about 3 1 dwt to the ton. I estimate the total amount of quartz crushed in this district during the month to be about 2750 tons. Alluvial workings at Brown's are in a rather depressed state. IS'othing new in that branch of mining has taken place there within the month. The quartz reefs there are improving. No. 6 Division. The British Workman's Company on Mul locky Point Reef are getting 8 dwt. to the ton ; the reef is eight feet wide, and they share about \u00a310 per man weekly. A share was lately sold for \u00a3305. (John Lynch, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Success Company have got from the last crushing 80 oz. for one fortnight's work ; this is a good reward for 12 men, the number of which the company consist. They have been obliged to knock oft' working for want of water. The Energetic Company, on Budgeon's Reef, crushed 136 tons, 70 of which gave 12 dwt., and the remainder 1^ oz per ton. Griffiths and party have struck the same reef, but of the result I am not informed. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Monkey Gully Lead has proved one of the most steady pa ing in the district.

The Albion Company have got gold on the reef, but it is believed the gutter will pass through the next claim \u2014 the Don Juan This last named company are progressing very well with their shaft; it is not far off the proper depth for the lead. Various other companies are at work in this locality, namely, the Lucky, British, North American, and several others, but nothing particular remains to be stated respecting them in addition to my previous reports of them. At Linton's, the Duke of Cornwall Com pany have at leng th got into first rate ground ; the only machine full which they have yet washed turned out 13 oz., besides a nugget of 4 oz ; there is great doubt as to whether this gutter can be the standard, as the depth at which the gutter was struck has been considered too shallow for the standard gutter. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The Atlas Company, next to the Duke of Cornwall, are also in a fair way of getting remunerated for their great outlay The wash-dirt in which they are now working will give 6 oz to the machine. It is believed that the junction of t he Royal Standard and Flag staff' and Standard Leads takes place here, and the wide expanse over which the wash-dirt is spread favors this hypothesis. The Pioneer Company, in Linton Paddock, were reported to have got a good prospect last week, but I have not heard it confirmed The Flying Buck, Glamorgan, and several old ground claims on the Standard Lead con tinue to yield splendid returns.

The Clark's Flat Crushing Company have had their machinery started several times during the month; but owing to the mal arrangement of a portion of the machinery, the company have had to make alterations, and have not been able to crush any quantity. almost the same as in my fonner reports, yet that the number of the European population is considerably decreased and that of the Chinese population increased. 1 have, as far as possible, compiled the present tables from the returns of the census enumerators, which are not how ever yet complete. Another company have commenced to erect a 12 horse-pi.wer engine aud battery of 10 stamps on Sehicer Hill The heavy fall of rain in this month has enabled some of the sluicing companies to get to work, and if moderately continued, will give the longest season for sluicing that I have experienced. Frenchman's Quartz Mining Company have sunk their main shaft to a depth of 1 8 J feet, and are obliged through the excess of water to put up a whim ; the reef was struck at a depth of 167 feet, and is 2 feet in thickness at that place ; the company are putting a level in to test it; the company also intend to sink the main shaft over iOO feet, and then put a cross cut at that depth; some good specimens have been taken out at the 167 feet level; 255 tons have been crushed from 31st March to 27th April, which yielded 82 oz. 5 dwt., or an average of nearly 6 dwt 1 0 \u00a3 gr. per ton. At the Bald Hills Lead the several parties who are getting gold continue to do as well as heretofore ; some of the companies do not give accurate information respecting their dividends The Sons of Justice average about 4 oz. per man weekly ; the Garii aldi Company from their last machine h ive washed out ;6 oz ; during the mouth three new claims have been taken up on this lead. Graham's Hill also continues equally well as formerly, nearly all the claims paying goo:1. wages. The machinery of the Prince of Wales Company has been removed, and the claim I believe is entirely abandoned. At Bullarook the several parties are still driving their tunnels, but have not yet reached the auriferous ground; some surface ground in this neighborhood is paying good wages. A new reef has been discovered on Cobbler's Gully Ranges this month, by Brown and part}- ; the present shaft is 50 feet in depth, a cross cut put in 10 feet met the reef, wdiich is at the present time not proved, the cross cut being 15 feet in the quartz reef and not through. At Ironstone Hill, Slaty Creek, those parties who were the first to get gold have been erecting dams, puddliug machines, &c, for the more effectual working of their claims, so that the quantity of gold obtained from this lead during the month has been but small ; the three parties who arc mentioned in my last report as having struck gold, find it all through the wash dirt, but very poor ; still they believe it will pay wages if passed through puddling machiues. Two new claims have been taken up on the supposed course of the lead. Referring to the Climes portion of my dis- trict, I have for the past month or two had the pleasure to mention the progressive character of the legitimate mining works, and unproved character of the machinery in course of erec- tion by the different companies for the better furtherance of their operations The needful period of time required to consolidate these important improvemeuts has not as yet arrived, as the details of my report will show. The class of machinery demanded here is of a superior kind, aud the miners have learnt by experience that their engine appliances must be fixed in the most substantial manner to enable them to work their mines at any great depth The first cost us these improved works is met by the profits derived from present operations \u2014 hence a prudential course, re- quiring time ; whilst at the same time the progressive mines are as gradually advancing to mature their engine power At no distant period I may have to record that there are engines here in constant work, numbering in total 506 horse -power at least. The consum mation of this will probably give employment to an increased number of miners. The Hard Hill Crushing Company have crashed for themselves 55o tons of tailings, headings, &c , which yielded 81 oz. 7 dwt., or an average of nearly 2 dwt 23 gr. ; they have also crushed 161| tons of cement and tailings fur other parties, which yielded 35 oz. 14 dwt. 21 gr The Enterprise Company have crushed of cement tailings and headings 5.38 Ions, which yielded 81 oz , or an average of 3 dwt. yj gr. per ton. The Little Wonder ( Company have purchased the engine and crushing plant of the Friend ship Company for \u00a3 1 1 50, and changed their name to the Clark's Hill Cement Crushing Company ; owing to the time required for making the transfer, &c, and a few necessary repairs, the company have only crushed sot three weeks ; the total quantity crushed by both batteries was 460 tons, which yii Ided 84 oz, or an average of 3 dwt. 13jjgr. per ton.

Their new poppet-heads are raised ; the timber used is of a good quality. The Victoria Company have got through the reef, called by them the Eastern Reef; it is about 12 feet thick, and is exceedingly hard. I he water on the lowest level, 335 feet, is very heavy, and much impedes the workings. From the upper level they are now raising stone ; the last trial crushing of 104 tons showed 1 7 dwt per ton. '1 he company's battery is now employed at crushing by contract, at It s. per ton, the quartz boulders and tailings collected from the clearing of the dunes Company's paddock (the abandoned alluvial ground); the yield has given 3 dwt. per ton. On the Welcome Reef they are sinking a winze near their boundary, at the point where a break took place, and intend to open out a cross cut at the water level to test the ground, with a view to the discovery of its continuation. The foundation for the new engine to work the mine at an increased depth is progressing most favorably ; it will be a veiy solid structure of hewn masonry ; some of the stones lately placed in position weigh more than two tons, and it is of a superior quality\u2014 procured on the spot almost. The New North Climes Company are making much progress with their preliminary works ; the poppet-heads are fixed, it is the most substantial work of the kind in this place. The sinking of the shaft is being carried on; the workshnps are of a substantial character, and well arranged. she company's engine has arrived on the ground ; it appears to be well finished, and a substantial piece of machinery; it was manufactured on Ballaarat The Port Phillip Company have crushed for the latter company, during the past month, 2609 tons, which yielded in bar gold 21 17 oz. 10 dwt. 10 gr. at per ton, on the average, nearly 1 6 dwt. 6 gr.

Alliance Quartz Mining Company. \u2014 The new poppet-heads are fixed, and the pipes and other pumping gear will be started to be applied next week. The engine is not completely fitted yet. I have before referred to the details of its erection ; the whole work is of a substantial kind. I am informed that this company's outlay is not less than \u00a320,0 0, and as yet they have but just tested a prospect of 8 and 9 dwt. per ton. The improved mining appliances which they are using will, doubt less, make their efforts of a payable nature. The Criterion Company have crushed 855 tons, which yielded 574 oz. 1 1 dwt. 12 gr., average per ton 13 dwt. 10 gr Robinson's Reef has not varied since my last; it is about 25 feet wide. They are getting out the quartz from the 160 feet level by stopes of six feet high, and are filling up the ground as they rise, prior to opening up a fresh stope ; this is effected with debris lowered through a pass from the surface. They have 54 feet in height to take down of this lode before they sink deeper. The last two weeks the company have paid dividends of \u00a325 and \u00a340 respectively per share. Alluvial Mining is now solely confined to the Southern Hill. The Young Sons of Freedom Company have put down a new shaft, depth 13\" feet; they were compelled to abandon the shaft formerly worked by the Constitution Company, which, after clearing up and repairing the drives, was rendered untenable by the ground coming bodily down fro.n the rock, causing the shaft to close together. The wash-dirt they are at present taising is poor; but they are driving in the direction of known better ground, which they had formerly touched and proved ; this drive is in over 100 feet. A whim is employed to raise the dirt. The battery, intended to crush and amalgamate the quartz boulders and wash-dirt, has not been erected The Clunes United Company have crushed about 750 tons, for an average of \u00a3 an oz. per ton. The company's works are in good order; they are raising quertz from the Eastern and Robinson's Reefs, which looks well. T he Yankee Company are obtaining nearly 1| oz. per ton. Their new winding and pumping engine is in position, and nearly finished to h\" fittrd up. The chimney shaft is 64 feet high; the base is 12 feet square , it is tapered off to 4 feet at top, and is well built of stone and brickwork. They have put down the new engine shaft 300 feet, lowered the old shaft to the same level, and are now- driving a cross cut to form a connexion. At the depth mentioned they have now no water The John Bull Company's shaft has come together at the sides, owing to the falling of the ground from the rock: they are filling it up, and drawing the timber as they proceed. I have before observed that this ground is very heavy and dangerous to work ; that the greatest"], [142, "128 MINING SURVEYORS' BEPORTS \u2014 APRIL. caution is needed. The drives are always strongly timbered, yet they are crushed to gether by (he pressure of the rotten rock giving way overhead. At the warning of cracking timbers the miners rush to the shaft, and several instances have happened of narrow escapes by them. The Sailor's Reef Company have purchased, and will shortly place on their ground an engine of 30 horse-power, with crushing ma chinery, &c. attached They have applied for an extension of their lease, from 300 yards in length to 600 yards The quartz already raised will realize 2 oz per ton. The Union Company will shortly continue their operations ; the ground south of them, known as and held by the Hi mingham Reef Prospect Company, have found the lost lode, and in my opinion there will be little difficulty in tracing it into their ground. The Perseverance Company are still idle, and at present I see no prospect of their com mencing operations afresh. The Cosmopolite Company are still idle, and for the reasons I have previously referred to. The Steiglitz Company have not yet completed the contract for the additional depth of sinking in their main shaft ; they have cut several small leaders in their present sinking, and all carrying gold ; these veins will be driven on when the sinking is completed The Gibraltar Company have theii new ma chinery on their ground \u2014 a 25 horse-power engine, with pumps, &c. ; they are com mencing their works forthwith. The Redan Company, New Chum Reef, have not yet commenced operations. The ground held by Messrs. Pyke and Trench, known as the New Chum Reef Com pany, is being worked, the old workings cleared out previous to a survey being made to find out the direction of the veins hitherto not found in this ground but leading from the Redan claim south. The crushing machinery of this company has been in full operation upon quartz tailings and quartz raised from different reefs here. The Southern Lights Company are obtaining \u00a34 per man weekly, with nothing of a special feature to mention. The many puddlers and sluicers of headings and tailings heretofore engaged have, at this time, discontinued their labors. Steiglitz Division. (T.

The race from the Moorabool Falls to Dolly's Creek is completed for seven to eight miles, and the work is being vigorously pushed forward. A further addition has just been made to the steam-power by the erection of an engine of 16 horse-power by the Simmons Keef Quartz Mining Company, to propel a newly patented quartz crushing machine, which will start. I am told, in a few days. A description of this machine I intend to give in my next report when its power will have been fully tested. The approximate value of all machinery will now be about \u00a3il,700, and the steam power about 126 horse. Quartz Reefs. \u2014 The operations in quartz mining still continue comparatively inactive arising from various causes, the principal of which is a deficiency of capital. The Tea-tree Creek diggings are progressing steadily, and with the average results. Morrison's diggings are very quiet, with the exception of a small rush about half a mile further north, on the opposite side of the river leading to \\\\ allace's station Dolly's Creek diggings are much duller than ever I saw before ; part of the old ground, known as Brown's Hill, has been taken up by a party of Chinamen, who are making a living, otherwise the other parts of the field are scarcely yielding payable wages to Europeans engaged on them. Simmons Keef. \u2014 The Imperial Company have been doing well during the month, the reef still continues of great thickness, and yields on the .a-erage about 15 dwt of gold to the ton of quartz They are now sinking their shaft deeper, which has reached the depth of 108 feet, and they are erecting a new whim with the view of extending their works. The Lerderderg Company are also sinking for a new winning, the object being to work on a larger scale than they have hitherto done, which they will be well able to do having most effective machinery and in first-rate order ; tueir battery consists of 25 stampers, propelled by a water wheel and a steam engine of thirty five horse-power. Blackwood Division. (Thomas Hay, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Simmons Reef Quartz Mining Com pany have been occupied during the month in erecting their new patent machinery, and making preparations for a vigorous start. The works will be in operation in a few days, and I look forward to good results. The Cornish Company, from having had a good supply of water, have been at work mostly through the month, but their yield is small. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Appleton Brothers have been engaged in opening a tunnel to admit drays into the mine; this they have nearly completed and will shortly be at work again Trewhella's Reef. \u2014 Trewhella Brothers have been as usual going on steadily and profitably, but the exact result does not transpire.

Garibaldi Reef\u2014 The yield of the crush ing, by some claimholdi-rs on this reef, as noticed in my last r port (nearly 6 oz to the ton), having become publicly known, has in duced some parties at t'reswick to take a claim on this reef for twenty men. I understand that most of them have some capital, and that it is their intention to employ hired labor, and, if successful, to erect machinery on the spot. This is a move in the right direction, and, if carried out, must eventuate in great benefit to the place, and particularly those poor elaimholders whose means are already exhausted.

There is another p rty who have taken a lease on this reef, to the south, who have already driven a tunnel with a view to intersect the reef, but have not yet reached it. I have nothing to report particularly on alluvial diggings, further than that with the increased supply of water this department of digging shows increased activity. BEECHWORTH MINING DISTRICT.

The machinery is as follows : \u2014 In alluvial diggings the small rush at Wooragee Flat is exciting some attention ; un fortunately the chief lead, named the Tyne mouth, runs mostly through Mr. Wallan's private land ; the charge he makes to the diggers is one-fifth of the gross proceeds ; this they grumble at, and consider it too much. James Clinton and party have taken up a prospecting claim in a lead two miles to the east of the Tynemouth Lead ; depth of sinking 28 feet; prospects, from 2 to 6 gr. the dish, 1J feet wash-dirt ; they seem to expect that their ground (200 yards by 33 yards) will turn out well. There has been but very little change in mining matters during the month, the little rain we have had not being sufficient to allow of any increase in the number of hands ; it has however enabled parties to work longer hours, and also had the effect of soaking the ground so that the next rains will be of great use. Slight as the rain was No. 2 reservoir in Yackandandah Division was filled to a depth of 5 feet, giving a good idea of what we may expect when the winter rains set in, aud the ground has become thoroughly soaked. In alluvial mining the only items for the month are the fact of a small rush to some sluicing ground on Kirby's Flat, and the taking up of two claims, one of 500 yards, another of 300 yards on Staghorn Flat. This flat is situated immediately below Allan's Flat, which up to the present time has been the lowest workings on Yackandandah Creek. Staghorn Flat was superficially prospected some years back, but wages were so high at the time, and the ground being very wet, it was declared not payable. The above mentioned two parties however are determined to try it thoroughly, and I cannot see why on the same creek and immediately below Allan's Flat which has been proved to be remarkably rich) the ground should not pay. There is no doubt machinery will be required to work it, but I think that in general if more machinery were used and less manual labor better returns would be had. With a few dams that are being put up, there will not be much scarcity of water on this flat during the coming winter, there being a good guttering ground in the ranges to the south. At Bowman's Forest mining is dull, with the exception of a few good claims ; the others, from the patchiness of the ground are rather poor. In the course of two or three days I will send down a detailed plan of the Per severance Lead, which will fully illustrate the nature of these diggings. On Reid's Creek several parties are taking up abandoned ground, with the intention of working it through the winter. At the Woolshed the miners are working steadily ; the engine lately placed on Wemar's claim has sunk, and will require to be re placed before the working of the claim can be continued. Yackandandah and Nine-mile Divisions. In quartz mining nothing new has transpired. On the Caledonia Reef, Clear Creek, Nos. 2, 3, and 4 North have got the reef and are busy sinking. The Polar Star prospectors have got up a small hand or one horse-power machine, but I have not as yet been able to ascertain its efficiency. On Henderson's, Adams', and other reefs in their vicinity miners are busy raising quartz. The owners of the machine in course of erection expect to commence crushing in about a month. (Thomas G.

The population is as follows : \u2014 The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Mining in both its branches is being briskly prosecuted throughout my division this month, although nothing materially important has occurred since my last report. The Sheepwash Rush is being extended daily, and the direction the lead is at present taking is about east-north-east, deepening as it extends; the present depth is 20 feet; some fine lots of gold were brought in this month. The miners seem sanguine as to the probable result, providing the lead continues and breaks out in the more open country towards the junction of the creeks (Sheepwash, Emu, and Axe Creeks). The charge for crushing per ton is from 16s. to \u00a31. A small though lively rush has taken place on Gibraltar Hdl, situate north-east of Hill's public-house, and promising to connect the old workings at Gibraltar with McCullum's old lead. The sinking at this little rush is irom 65 to 70 feet, 20 feet of which is trap rock ; the remainder composed of clay and gravel is comparatively easy to sink through. The depth of wash-dirt 2 feet, and the yield averages 11 dwt. to the load. The depth of the bed-rock at McCullum's There have been a few new reefs struck and opened this month in various parts of the district, with varied results, and in one or two instances reefs have been caught again, upon leads where it was thought it had been worked out; as one instance, I wdl mention a lead close to and parallel with the Opossum Reef, Kangaroo Gully; in this the stone was opened on the surface and followed down 20 to 30 feet, leaving no trace of its existence, excepting the strata of lava which is invariably found in Occupation.

The body of quartz shown on plan commencing at No. 2, and running north, was discovered by driving from shaft No. 1, first in a north easterly, and secondly in a south-easterly di rection about 60 feet from the shaft, where it is discovered to average 10 feet 6 inches in thickness. The following table shows all procurable information from 1 to 7 inclusive : \u2014 Finches Reef, represented on same plan, is not at present being worked, although the greater portion of it is leased. On this reef there is a water shaft sunk to the depth of 200 feet. On the supposed continuation of this reef is the Hit or Miss, on which two claims are being worked ; the shaft of one is already 210 feet deep, the water level in which is 120 feet from the surface ; stone crushed from a depth of 150 feet yielded 6\u00a7 oz per ton. The reef at 200 feet from surface is from six inches to two feet in thickness, but no crushing has lately taken place. A considerable rash is likely to take place in the neighborhood of the Amherst Government Reservoir, portions of which will be in this and the Amherst Division. The cause of the rush is the fact that gold was found while excavating to the bed-rock for the purpose of constructing the reservoir, the embankment of which is situate about 10 chains south-east of the dividing line between these divisions. At present a considerable number of miners are on the ground awaiting the reply to a petition forwarded to the Government for permission to sink within the water area of the reservoir. If permission be granted work will immediately be commenced, when doubtless a long though narrow lead will be traced in a northerly direc tion through a lengthy and extensive flat which forms the lowest part of the water-shed from which the reservoir will be supplied. The accompanying plan represents the rela tive positions of shafts Nos. 1 and 2 on the Mariner's Reef, together with the buildings erected for the purpose of working these claims. North-west of shaft No. 1 is an engine of four horse-power used for raising quartz and debris from shafts Nos. 1 and 2. South-west is a forty horse-power engine used for raising water from the depth of nearly 460 feet. South a capstern for raising and lowering the water piping represented in the section of No. 1 shaft which, for the purposes of ventilation &c, is a \" donble \" one {i.e.) divided into two by a line of wooden slabs in the centre. This shaft has been sunk for several years, and as it is slabbed from top to bottom the different strata cannot be ascertained by observation. Throughout the seven claims it will be per ceived that the reef is one continued, well defined body of quartz ; out of Nos. 5, 6, and 7, sixteen men (thirteen below and three on top) can raise weekly 75 tons of quartz. Quartz mining generally is progressing favorably. Thirteen new reefs have been dis covered in various parts of the division, on which prospecting claims have been secured, while many of those previously discovered have given satisfaction, several of which de serve special mention. Amongst these is the Leviathan Reef, situate immediately on the east side of Chinaman's Flat Old Lead. There are twelve claims being worked which vary in depth from 60 to 150 feet. In claims Nos. 5, 6, and 7, at a depth of from 60 to 115 feet, the reef is from 3 to 8 feet thick ; average yield 25 dwt. per ton. From claim No. 6 five men can raise six tons per day.

Dundee Reef also deserves some notice, from the fact of its being forfeited leased ground This reef, situate at the south end of Adelaide Lead, and recently leased by a Mr. Linds.iy and Company, had been pronounced not payable; but as soon as it was open to the miners, a party of four had not been long discovering a payable reef, which at a depth of 25 feet is 2 feet thick; average yield 1J oz. per ton. The party is now increased to twelve, who have secured an extended claim of 600 feet. The following is the number of tons crushed by the machines for the month of April, (principally cement) : \u2014 Havelock Flat. \u2014 The prospectors on Fron tage Lead here, referred to in my last report, have bottomed their shaft (90 feet deep) Wash-dirt 2J feet thick, which averages, as yet, 10 dwt. per load, a result which it appears has given some satisfaction, particularly as it has been discovered that the water (hitherto considered a great impediment) will not prove so troublesome as it had been anticipated, the whole of which can be made avadable for washing purposes.

I have the honor to report that the popu lation of this division has been greatly aug mented since my last report, in consequence of a very extensive rush having set in near the head of Amherst Flat, about 1J miles distant from Amherst township, and which owes its existence to the reservoir now being constructed there. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 From the commencement of the construction of the reservoir it was generally understood that if payable gold existed it would be dis covered, as an excavation to the bed rock was to be carried across the flat from range to range.

It oozed out. however, that some gold was discovered, and one party considered it sufficient inducement for them to prospect the flat convenient to the reservoir; they accordingly commenced, and at a depth of 2 1 feet reached the bed-rock, and from two small buckets of the auriferous earth taken off the bottom of their shaft, obtained over 4 oz. of the precious metal. The rush immediately set in at the dead hour of night, claims were marked out in all directions in cluding the whole of the reservoir. In quartz mining nothing of any importance has taken place this month ; the new rush has drawn the attention of those who were per severing in prospecting for new reefs, and until the rush ceases the number employed in this way will be limited I forward a plan and sections of a portion of the diggings on Kangaroo Flat, connected with survey of last month. The diggings are prin cipally being worked with puddling machines, and a few Chinese. Dunollt Division. (R. J. McMillan, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follow-s : \u2014 At the time I write there cannot be less than three thousand miners on the ground, who in general have great confidence in the permanaucy of the diggings. The rush at present is extending down the flat towards the old lead which was lost some years ago, a little above the township of Amherst. In some places the lead is only a few yards in width, and in others two or three claims ; those who have been fortunate enough to strike the lead are getting well remunerated; in several instances from J oz. to 1 oz. to the tub has been obtained. No doubt exists but the lead extends up the flat above the reser voir, but the miners will not be allowed to mine on the reserve of the reservoir till the sanction of Government is obtained. The sinking is from 12 to 25 feet, and dry. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 Scandinavian Lead.\u2014 On this lead several parties are doing extremely well, but the extent of ground to be worked is limited, as it junctions with the Rocky Flat Lead. Rocky Flat Lead. \u2014 It is now decided in which direction this lead has taken, which is in the direction of Gibraltar. About a fort night ago I laid out a new line in the above mentioned direction, and registered parties for claims up to the private property which inter venes between Gibraltar and this lead. The claims that were taken up in three-acre blocks were abandoned and taken up under the front age system. Nos. 12 and 13, Rocky Flat West, have struck the deep ground, and from a shovel full of the auriferous earth obtained 4 dwt. of gold. Nos. 1 4 and 1 5, engine claim, adjoining Nos. 12 and 13, bottomed their shaft the other day. and obtained a very encouraging prospect, in fact this lead looks better at pre sent than what it has done for a length of time. Mia Mia Flat.\u2014 A small rush has been going On here for the last three weeks on a spur of deep ground running from the main lead. Several parties are obtaining from i oz. to 1 oz. to the load, and occasionally better than this. The sinking is from 30 to 40 feet and wet ; about 1 50 men are remuneratively employed.

On the 27th a prospecting claim two miles south of the first diggings got a prospect of J oz. per load : and one a short distance east of them, a prospect of 1 oz. per load, indicating that gold is generally distributed over the flat; and when it is remembered that it is sur rounded by what had once been rich diggings, viz., Dunolly, Jones's Creek, Sandy Creek, Moliagul, and Mclntyre's, there is a great pro bability of it ultimately becoming of some consequence. Total number of persons of all classes residing within the Korong division 16,300. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 At Cochrane's an impetus has been given to alluvial mining, in consequence of a small rush, and the erection of a steam crushing machine, which has been removed from Sandy Creek by a party of enegetic Welsh miners, who intend crushing cement, which is to be had in large quantities. These diggings con sist of a number of made hills, in all of which a layer of cement, varying from 6 inches to 2^ feet in thickness, overlies the wash-dirt; it contains more or less gold, but not in suf ficient quantity to pay for carting a great dis tance and crushing ; the nearest crushing machine hitherto being about eight miles, and crashing 25s. to 35s. per ton. At Burnt Creek, the Chinese, about 800 in number, continue steadily at work, and are disposed to take up extended claims with a view to work the ground more efficiently. I have no doubt they are doing well. Throughout the rest of the division there is nothing of importance to report but an increase in the number of puddling machines, to the extent of fourteen during the month. In quartz mining there is no change ; the various paying reefs are being worked in their usual steady manner, and many that would pay, if energetically worked, and with ma chinery on the spot, are locked up by being registered. One new reef, named the Albion, near Dunolly, has been discovered during the month ; a few tons have been crushed, which gave about 1 oz. to the ton. The. number of quartz reefs proved to be auriferous, 130. The number of square miles of auriferous ground actually worked on 26. Aggregate value of mining plant in this division \u00a329,000. I have during the month registered the following prospect claims : \u2014 One alluvial, situate in Dalmatia Gully, about quarter of a mile west of Wedderburne township; shallow sinking, prospect produced 12 dwt to fifteen American buckets. One alluvial, situate Gulf Road Gully, Korong, about four miles west of Wedderburne township ; prospect 8 dwt. to three tubs. One quartz reef, situate St. John's Reef, Jordan's diggings, near Jericho ; prospect produced 52 oz. 18 dwt. from 19 tons 13 cwt. 2 qr. of quartz. The mining population has still further increased since my last report, the principal attraction being the Deep Lead, Old Inglewood, mentioned in my last, and which appears to have fully realized the hopes entertained of its proving a good rash. The population at this place, which last month did not exceed 500 persons, now numbers considerably over 2000, and is daily increasing. Korong Division. (John S. Robertson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The sinking in this lead is now over 130 feet, but as yet quite dry. The prospects obtained from the last holes bottomed show an evident improvement on the previous ones. The average yield of several claims bottomed within the last week would be from 4 to 6 oz. to the load. I have forwarded a sample of the stratum on which the gold is deposited. The wash- Description.

The lead, which at first starting was only payable one claim wide, has now considerably opened out. to hoist with. One claim on the Columbian Reef which, from a depth of between 80 and 90 feet, obtained over 100 tons of quartz, calculated the cost of raising to be 23s. per ton. Several parties are sinking prospecting shafts on the supposed course of the lead, considerably in advance of the last bottomed shafts, in order to obtain the increased area allowed to prospectors. The Old Inglewood prospectors have, since my last report, erected a powerful engine and a battery of stampers on their claim ; their claim having all the appearance of lasting for years. I have marked out sites for places of business, &c, nearly all of which have been readily occupied. Between the old deep lead and the new lead a claim has been bottomed and a very good prospect obtained, and from this circumstance I am lead to believe that the supposition that the new lead was a continuation of the old one to be perfectly correct. The deep lead at New Inglewood or Daly's frontage lead, as it is called, has not been able to overcome the water, although they have steam-power to assist them ; I have, there fore, nothing new to report on since my last returns. The alluvial sinking at Old Kingower and Glenalbyn have, this month, obtained several more nuggets, although not so large as re ported previously ; many of the miners have taken up claims on Old Inglewood rush. A small rush took place in Scrubby Gully at the commencement of the month, in con sequence of some good heavy gold having been found in a prospecting claim, but since that time many of the parties have left dis appointed. At Korong, the quartz reefs have been very inactive, and have made no further progress than reported by me last month. In Old Kingower, the Hope Reef, it is ru moured, has struck gold, very rich indeed ; but no authentic information has, as yet, reached me. At Korong, a good deal more activity has been displayed in shallow sinking, on account of several claims in various gullies giving very satisfactory returns ; the coming season will enable these gullies to be thoroughly worked, as the great detriment to alluvial mining at Korong is the extreme scarcity of water for washing purposes. At Mclntyre's, some of the quartz reefs which had been previously abandoned, and which are now held as extended claims, give very fair promise of proving remunerative, although they have not, as yet, had time to have the stone properly tested. The puddling machines in this district are now getting ready for work in earnest, as most of the dams are full, owing to the copious supply of rain we have had lately. In Jericho, the quartz reefs are now yielding steady profitable returns ; during the last month the average yield of gold on the several reefs has been from 2 to 3 oz. per ton, and the thickness of the reefs themselves average 9 to 10 feet. In Inglewood, the quartz reefs have this month proved very satisfactory. The under mentioned reefs having struck fresh lodes of stone in their claims, and from a computation of the crushings obtained from the various reefs, I estimate the average yield of gold to be from 4 J- to 5 J oz. to the ton of quartz. Raising the quartz, however, is at present a much more expensive operation than it should be, on account of every claim (with very few exceptions) employing men and the windlass Johnston and party, who have applied tor a lease of part of an abandoned reef are about putting up an effective crushing machine and machinery for raising quartz. In Jordan's, a very good yield has been ob tained from an abandoned reef. Name of Eeef. Depth from Surface. Thickness of Eeef. Maxwell's Eeef . . 25ft. 6 to 18ft.

On the Bristol Reef, New Bendigo, the claims are nearly all being steadily worked. For some little time they were all but aban doned, but the discovery of gold in No 4 North and No 3 South, has given an impetus in the right direction to those who were doubt ful. St. Aknatid Division. (Charles H. Raven, Mining Surveyor.) she population is as follows :\u2014 At the Chrysolite Hill, on the so called Musical Reef, Mo. 1 East has succeeded in striking what they presume to be payable quartz ; none yet having been crushed no reliable information could be given. From the Prospect Claim a kiln of quartz supposed to yield 7 or 8 oz. per ton was lately crushed ; from the first 5 tons they obtained a yield of between 5 and 6 oz. per ton; the re maining 1 r tons when crushed did not yield \u00a3 an oz. per ton, an apparent mystery that has not yet been solved : the quartz when landed from the shaft being thrown carelessly on the kiln to be burned, from thence carted to the ma chine and deposited outside, to be wheeled in barrows and weighed as required, so that it would seem almost impossible for them not to be well mixed, and from which a trial of 5 or 6 tons should be a fair sample ; whether from a fault or defect in the mill, or an unexampled peculiarity in the quartz, is as yet unknown, no such result has ever yet been found by using the same mill Messrs Gurison, Edgar, and Company have nearly completed the erection of tlieir engine, &c.. for pumping and crushing from their deep shaft, situate on lease south of St. Arnaud United Company. The progress of this com pany is watched with great interest by many. A good thickness of payable stone is known to be in their ground, but from the treacherous nature of the country, and the difficulty ex perienced from the water hitherto, it has not until now had a fair opportunity of being tried The shaft at present is over 200 feet in depth. The piping on the ground is Col. Anderson's patent paper pipe, the use and result of which is watched with more than she machinery is as follows : \u2014 Price of crushing by stamps, from 15s. to \u00a31 ; by mill, \u00a31 10s. The population in this division has slightly decreased during the last month, owing to several minor rnshes having occurred in its immediate neighborhood. At Hines' and in the surrounding neighbor hood several prospecting claims have been applied for, some with very good prospects. At Sing Song Gully, l\u00a3 imles west of the Ten-raile-hut, Hunter and party obtained a prospect of 2 dwt. to the bucket, also two small pieces weighing respectively 2 and 3 dwt. from the bottom of their shaft, sinking four feet : on the following morning a rush took place when 60 or 70 holes were bottomed, but with the exception of one claim, in no other has gold been found. On the same day a prospecting claim was applied for in the deep ground at Hines, prospect 1 dwt. to the bucket ; gold coarse, depth 60 feet, require slabbing, 10 feet water in the shaft when inspected. Scarcely anything worth recording was doing at Hines proper, the ground still continuing patchy, the general yield of good claims not being more than 10 dwt. per load. The reefs in this portion of my division are yet being worked, but in the absence of all crushing machinery (the nearest being 20 miles) it is usual interest. A section of this claim was forwarded on plan in October last, as also the section of one or two other claims on this reef, but to this is attached more interest on account of its being able, when worked, to solve the theory of these reefs being the continuation of, or leaders to, the main lode, now leased by the St. Arnaud United. At the St. Arnaud United the works are still progressing vigorously, nearly all the machinery is on the ground (and contracted for i to be perfectly ready in eight weeks, during which time the company intend carrying a drive through the point or saddle of Wilson's Hill, over 420 feet in length, so as to convey their water from the reservoir to their engine Occupation.

The population is as follows : \u2014 > Chinese. \u2014 The Chinese population remains nearly the same in the division although many are said to be returning to their native countiy. The extensive rush towards Guildford. pre viously reported is very much diminished the Chinese returning to their old claims in Forest and Barker's (.'reeks, every hill, gully, and flat receiving its quota. Some time since a number of reserves were proclaimed as sites for Chinese encampments, \u2014 they were so occupied for a time, but now the Chinese are camping at pleasure and the proclaimed reserves are generally unoccupied. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 I have the honor to forward plans of portions of my division in accordance with tracings and instructions received. These complete the southern portion of the Castlemaine division to the western boundary line of the Municipality of Chewton. the water fall being tak n as the dividing line between Castlemaine and Fryers divisions. The plans include Whitehorse and Dinah Flats, V\\ hitehorse. Milkman's, 'three Speck, Rocky, Wattle, Deadman's, Steel's, and But cher's Gully's and adjacent ranges. I have repeated Wattle Gully for the purpose of showing the newly constructed Government road and the two quartz mining leases ; all the newer surveys are shown with the bearings and measurements marked thereon. In alluvial mining, the late heavy rains have produced a change; the puddlers and others wanting water now having a superabundance whilst many who were working before are now flooded out \u2014 the change is more of locality of operation than of number. In quartz mining, a considerable impetus has been given by the accidental discovery of a rich quartz reef under the alluvium in the basin of the 1 linah Flat reservior A miner casually picked up a specimen, and sinking 12 feet on the larger portion of the reservior be fore unworked, came upon a wide reef ; a rush was the result, there are now 20 claims work- The plan includes four gold mining leases, at least seventeen parallel quartz reefs, than which, probably, none ever yielded more gold: instance the Sheffield from which quartz was extracted yielding at the rate of 2000 oz per ton; the Wattle dully which has yielded 953 oz. from 4 tons, and lately 39 oz from one bucket j the Eldorado from which gold has D Occupation.

At Pickpocket the various companies are busily engaged either in the erection of machinery for the drainage of their claims, or putting down larger paddocks and uncovering large areas of washing stuff. The Dinah Flat reservoir is also shown with water line after the late flood. The reservoir being filled, the nine-inch pipe remaining open, in about four hours the puddling and pumping machine houses, tents and gardens being al most completely under water, and of course all the claims swamped. From the recent exca vations within and above the dam a great quantity of sediment was left after the water had subsided. The Perseverance Company have completed the erection of a six horse-power steam engine, which is engaged in pumping only. This company have had a good prospect from the bottom of a small paddock, but what the claim will yield when they are in full work it is impossible to say. McLeod's party have erected a strong horse pump and are busily at work, but without any success up to this time in the drainage of tho water. The manager informs me that they intend erecting a pump to be worked by steam power. Fryer's Ckeek Division. (R. L. M. Kitto, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows The Black Hawk Company have purchased au engine of considerable power, which they intend fixing as soon as possible. McKay, Leith, and Company (half of whose claim of 20 acres is in the Fryer's Creek divi sion and the remainder in the Tarrangower) are not yet at work, although they have a very powerful engine in position ; they expect to be in full operation in a few days. Carmichael's engine (14 horse-power) has been at work for about three weeks, but with what results I am unable to ascertain. The machinery is as follows ; \u2014 Although the whole of the above companies are either briskly at work or making prepara tions to that end, no one can form an idea as to the results; from what I have seen, however, of the individual miners who are working por tions of the ground with tubs and cradles, something good may be expected. Two tubs of stuff were washed in my presence which produced 1 oz. of gold. I have heard that as much as 3 oz. to the tub has been got. The Windlass Hill Company (Fryerstown) are doing remarkably well ; they are at work every day and appear to be in a thriving state. The tunnel in Heron's Hill has not up to this time reached the drift, although from the great quantity of water issuing from the rock, the miners cannot be far distant . In Pyke's Hill, Hartley and Company have reached the edge of the drift, from which they have extracted a little gold, but not in paying quantities, nor do they expect payable gold lor another 200 feet.

The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The El Dorado Company are busily at work, employing 33 men ; their returns are very moderate, barely clearing working expenses. The Turon's Reef Company are at a stand still. The Emu has again started to work under the direction of the purchaser of the plant, who is engaged in prospecting the ground. I am informed that in the event of his not finding payable stone, he intends winding up the con cern. The Alliance Company's affairs are still in the hands of the Court of Mines. The (Vaughan) Perseverance Company are busily engaged in crushing for the public ; they are making good wages. The Kangaroo Company are at work and making good dividends. They are crushing with 12 heads of stampers, and intend putting 4 more in position, to be worked by the same engine. Approximate value of mining plant in this division \u00a37000. With respect to the ordinary mode of wash ing with tub and cradle very little is doing in any part of this division. This class of miners is extremely scattered. Another party have applied for a site for machinery at Kangaroo. The Vaughan Gold Mining Company are still progressing satisfactorily. The manager informs me that they expect better yields than ever from their claim. The leads are running into the ground lately applied for on lease by H. C. Thorburn. Taradale to the Eastward. \u2014 Quartz Work ings. \u2014 Two claims on the Victoria and two on the Ashtonia are yielding good results. The New Years Reef promises well, and parties are working energetically on the Prince of Wales's. A new reef is being opened up in this locality farther north of all the other workings. The other quartz mines situate hereabouts are relinquished, though two of them only temporally, being protected by registration. I send a vertical section of J. McKetchnie's claim, situated on Commissioners Flat, in which was discovered a reef known as the Town Reef, 'fcis reef was not visible on the surface, in consequence of the alluvial deposits lodged thereon. The prospectors have had 8 tons crashed from the entire body, which has yielded 1 2 dwt. per ton. I forward a tracing showing the exact position of the above section. A reef, called the Bonaria, was abandoned the other day, although a ton of stone yielded 5 dwt. of gold, and that was obtained at a depth not exceeding 8 feet. It was not suffici ently rich to pay the expenses involved in raising, carting, and crashing. Want of capi tal is the great drawback to the development of our reefs ; many of them known to be au riferous are left, because the proprietors have not means to prosecute the search further. Taradale Division. (Thomas Turner, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Barfold Reefs. \u2014 Operations are somewhat reviving in this quarter : working has been resumed on Gibbons's Reef; and a second cl aim resumed on Steed's Reef. The prospec tors' claim on Steed's Reef has always held good, yielding an average of 4 oz. to the ton.

Maldon Division, (Robert Nankivell, Mining Surveyor.) Since the rainy weather has set in three new puddling machines have been set to work. \u2014 one at Yankee point, a second at Charcoal burner's Gully, and a third at Victoria Gully. The population is as follows :- The Liberty Flat Company (holding a lease of ten acres immediately south of the town ship) are now in full working order. There are twenty-six men employed in the works, who are either shareholders or their substi tutes. The mode of working pursued is wheel ing out the whole of the earth, which averages ten feet in depth, and puddling through a re volving cylinder the bottom gravelly drift, which varies in thickness from a few inches up to two feet. The yield of gold from two months' work, i.e., since the 1st of March, has been 43 oz., which is a good yield considering the small area yet stripped. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Italians, who are sluicing ground just above that occupied by the above-named com pany, are working vigorously, and seem well satisfied with the results. They hold a privi lege of three acres. Two other sluicing privileges are being suc cessfully worked on the Coliban River to the north of Taradale. Campaspe River. \u2014 A few miners are scat tered up and dowTi the Campaspe, between Mr. Mitchell's station and its junction with the Coliban They must be regarded rather as prospecting parties, no settled workings having yet been established. Owing to the rains during the present month mining has received a fresh impetus, two allu vial companies, viz., the Maldon and Porcupine Gold WTashing Associations, have recommen ced working with good prospects.*and the horse puddling machines are averaging fair retu-ns. The greater portion of this district pre senting to view the recent volcanic deposits, termed by geologists t appean formations, ob scures its auriferous character ; but wherever the silurian formations appear, which they do in isolated patches and especially along the bed of the river, its character as a gold field is sufficiently indicated. Two small rushes have taken place since my last ; one about a mile from Newstead on the Castlemaine-road, where there are about 30 diggers at work; and the other on the Govern ment-road passing through Cayhill's farm on the Loddon, where a few holes have been bottomed but nothing found. The miners at Pickpocket are leaving for Inglewood and other places, as the water in many places is too difficult to overcome without the aid of ma chinery A good number of diggers are em ployed along the Jim Crow Creek, between the Pickpocket and Strangways, on private property, and some are getting good wages. I have forwarded with this report plan and sections of Fenteman's Reef, which is situated about 2J miles from the township of Maldon : this reef is remarkable for its regularity, it being nearly of the same breadth throughout as far as opened up ; the claimholders purpose forming a company to work the reef by the aid of machinery, in consequence of the usual Malmsbury Diggings. \u2014 The old Coliban Reef, which has been so long abandoned, has been again taken up.

In one of the claims ( Bohringher's) at water level a leader has been struck which I am of opinion is lead and silver ore ; this leader forms a portion of the lode from whence gold bearing quartz is taken it is about six inches in width, but owing to the water it has not been opened to any great extent ; the width of the ieef at this place is about three feet, a few tons of quartz crushed from this spot yielded 1 J oz of gold to the ton. The Eaglehawk Quartz Mining Association's mine is still yielding well ; two dividends of ten per cent, each have been declared within the last five months; during this period it has cleared upwards of \u00a34000. The quartz crushed during the ni\"nth by this company was 755 tons, producing 347 oz of gold. The latest returns from the Eaglehawk Union Company on the same reef, give 1 1 5 oz of gold from 222 tons of quartz ; the quartz now being raised looks very well, and the new battery of stampers at present works admirably The Linscot's Keef Association washed off Nuggety Reef still continues to pay well ; most of the claims on this belong to private parties. Gold was struck last week in a claim known as .Marshall's. This reef has been hitherto one of the richest reefs on Tarran gower. But little can be said of the private quartz claims of this district, as most of them have been amalgamated into companies I.eighton and Company whose claim is in the centre of of the Union Company's ground, has just completed a crashing of 39J tons, of which 4^ tons yielded at the rate of 13^ oz to the ton, and the remainder 2 oz to the ton. This claim is one of those fortunate ones which has be n profitable from its commencement. The Prince Llewelh n Company, at York shire Hill Sandy Creek, has during the last fortnight crushed 60 tons from their claim, which yielded 30 oz. of gold. At Omega Reef, South Muekleford, Ramsden and party crushed a trial lot of four tons, from a heap of about 70 tons, at the Atlas Company's crushing nrlls. which yielded 22J dwt. to the ton : this trial was made at the Atlas, in consequence of their being dissatisfied with the yields obtained at their own engine, which only yielded 8 dwt per ton. The process of amal gamation adopted was that of shaking tables, while that at the Atlas is the Chilian basin last week: the yie'd for one week from eight heads of stampers, was 193 oz. of gold, and the next two days crushing produced 96 oz of amalgam, so that the returns may be con sidered as first-rate. The North Linscot's Company is proceeding rapidly with its machinery, and sanguine ex pectations are being held respecting the quartz now raised. The yields from the Beehive Company's ground is very low at present but the gold is getting coarser as the miners proceed, which is considered a good indication on this reef The machinery of the Parkins's Reef Asso ciation is expected to be ready by the 8th instant: the quartz now being raised looks very promising. Two large dams have been ex cavated, so that a constant supply of water, independent of that in the reef may be ex pected The engine shaft is down 188 feet, at which depth water has been struck. The Independent Company, on the same reef, is erecting its machinery for pumping. crushing. &c Two dams have been con structed, and a contract has been let for sink ing an engine shaft to the depth of 150 feet There are two private claims on this reef but they are both regi-tered pending the erection of machinery by the two companies. The engine and stampers of the Cookman's Reef Association are completed, and crushing operations are expected to commence next week. Since the machinery has been erecting, operations have been carried on in the mine below, and about 160 tons of quartz is now lying on the surface ready for crushing. The Concord Asssociation at Sandy Creek made a trial start of their new battery of stampers this week, and will soon be ready for crashing operations ; about 200 tons of quartz is now ready for crushing. Porter's process has been tried here with he fdlowing results, viz. from tolbs. of tailings, 6 gr. of gold were extracted, but the general feeling seems to be against it. I think that if the quartz, instead of being burnt prior to crusliing were first crushed and then calcined, it would possess the great ad vantage of exposing all the baser metals to the action of the fire, after which the gold could be easily separated by washing, thereby doing away with quicksilver, which is a very ex pensive process ; for this purpose furnaces might be constructed similar to those used for cabining tin or s in Enghmd. With this I have transmitted a specimen of the lead ore spoken of as above. Hepburn Division. (Ambrose Johnson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Occupation. Europeans. Chinese.

The machinery is as follows : \u2014 yielded 8 oz per ton, and from the adjoining claim south as much as 23 oz. per ton were obtained; and last week No. 3 South struck the reef, looking quite as well as in No. 2. The Adelaide Reef, in Nos. 1 and 2 claims, crushes on an average 2 or 3 oz. per ton, by a width of 2 or 3 feet; and No. 3 is expected to strike the same run of gold one of these first weeks. Gibson's Reef, in Scotchman's Gully, is showing a first-rate prospect in the prospecting claim, but the reef is only so lately opened that as yet the other claims have obtained no results On Welcome Reef, Council's Gully, Messrs. Villard and Company have for a long time been sinking a new shaft, and no crashing has therefore taken place during the month; and the Pioneer Company have by sale disposed of their lease and machinery to the Cornish party, who have not as yet commenced operations. New Nuggety Reef, also in Connell's Gully, is as usually paying remarkably well, and the party, I believe, are beginning to prepare for the erection of steam machinery on the ground, as the water is getting too heavy for baling by ordinary means. Beehive Reef has during the last month maintained its usual name for richness, the quartz now being landed looking as rich as ever. The mining population has not during the month been visibly affected, and mining mat ters as a whole are looking rather brisk than otherwise. In machinery no addition has taken place. The crushing machines are generally kept steadily employed, and those to be employed in alluvial mining, described as erecting, are nearly ready to commence operations. Quartz mining in Jim Crow has during the last month, as usually, been favorably pro gressing, the old reefs still on an average pay ing well, and those lately opened in the western part of the gold workings are bidding fair to rival some of the best hitherto discovered. Sportsman's and Parker's, Specimen Reef, near the head of Dry Diggings are both inactive. In Yandoit some first-rate stone has been crushed during the last month, and most of the reefs are again getting into working order ; I trust to be worked with more caution and with better success than during the late feckless rash. On W'ombat Reef matters look very satis factory. The original Cornish party, a= usual, clearing a good dividend, and the adjoining claims\u2014 Messrs. Clark and Company and Messrs. Grenfield and Company \u2014 are both busy sinking. The whole of Colliers' Reef is dormant: the only party occupying a claim, Sampson and Company, not as yet having succeeded in obtaining the aid of steam machinery. On Melvin's Reef matters remain unchanged: the quartz generally is only poor, but good patches are occasionally come across, and on the whole, having a thick reef and machinery on the ground, the party manage to get paid for their labor. From the prospecting claim on Trogish's Reef the last crushing averaged about 2 oi. per ton, and all the adjoining claims are going down in high spirits. From Glanmorganshire Reef the last crash ing of 35 tons from claim No. 2 North, aver aged about 36 oz. per ton. In the prospecting claim, at a depth of about 90 feet, the quartz looks splendid, and we may shortly expect another monster crushing. The rest of the claims are briskly sinking, but I expect they will have to go very deep to strike the same run of gold as the two last-named claims are now working. On Hamburg Reef the prospecting claim and No. 2 South, lately so celebrated for their extraordinary richness, are now down to water, and the yield has lately decreased in a most alatming degree. Preparations are, I believe, being made to enlarge the companies and procure the aid of steam machinery. Several of the claims are down about 1 50 feet, but as yet with no prospect. On Adams' aud Emeu Reefs work has for some time been suspended, but I understand that engines for both reefs have just been purchased, and it is therefore to be expected that operations will soon be resumed, and from what is known of the reefs, the high opinion entertained of both is in my opinion well founded.

From claim No. 3 South, held by Mor rison and Company, one crushing yielded 1 5 dwt. per ton ; and from No 5 South, where the reef is only just struck, the yield was only 2 dwt to the ton, but there is every reason to believe that the yield will improve as they go deeper A number of claims on the same reef are going down, but as yet with no definite results. are pretty well occupied, and in many instances claims considered worked out have been found to pay very well for puddling all the refuse stuff, as now, in most cases. by damming up an abandoned tunnel water can be made available for puddling throughout the whole year. In alluvial sinking there has been no rushes in the division. In Blanket Flat, between Daylesford and Deep Creek, deep ground has been found, apparently traceable to Black Jack's Gully, and trending in a north-westerly direction towards Mr. Egan's station. Judging from appearances I should say that the flat at present offers as good a show as I for a long time have seen in alluvial mining, and I have no doubt that shortly an extensive rush will take place in that locality. Of three shafts going down, one bottomed on the reef at a depth of 135 feet, but the water is so heavy that it is not expected the party will be able to prose- cute their search for the deep ground from this shaft. In the meantime a number of claims have been marked, and great anxiety is manifest as to the ultimate results of the shafts sinking. In the gullies in the vicinity several parties are at work with the old fashioned tub and cradle, and although I have heard of no heavy nuggets having come to light, still on the whole the parties seem to be making a com- fortable living. The new discovered, or rather the newly resound lead, from the head of Doctor's Gully through Daylesford, is turning out splendid, the yield varying from J to 1J oz. per load, and the thickness of wash-dirt being from 2 to 6 feet. In the northern portion of the township all private properties through which the lead passes are in full work, and tunnelling and sinking are briskly going on for the con- tinuation through the southern portion of the township. Messrs. Sheppard and Company, who have taken up the police reserve, have, I under- stand, made arrangements for working the ground from a tunnel going in from Johnson's Gully towards Queensberry street, in my opinion the most advisable step they could take. From the Great Reef Company I have heard no news of importance, but I believe their batteries are being kept steady employed, crushing for hire. On IScew German Reef the new proprietors of the prospecting claim, Messrs. Cuthbe.rt and Company, are busy erecting their crushing apparatus near the Yandoit Creek, intending to transport their quartz thither by means of a 'tramway upwards of 1000 feet in length. The adjoining claim, No. 2 South, is reported to have struck the reef, but have been compelled by the sudden influx of water to erect a whim, and hence their reef has not as yet had any proper trial. Besides these, a great number of claims on the different reefs are being taken up, some of them in full work, but nothing worthy of remark has during the last month transpired on any. Puddling and Sluicing. \u2014 Puddling has during the last month received quite an impe- tus. From Bendigo and Forest Creek, where generally puddlers are considered more expert than elsewhere parties are weekly coming in, and most of them after a while take up claims and domesticate themselves in Jim Crow, a circumstance that augers well for the pros- perity of the coming winter. Puddling has during the last month been very brisk, and as far as I can learu, very satisfactory, most parties having an ample supply of water. Parties interested in sluicing operations are beginning to prepare for the winter season, most of them having during the last month been busy cleaning out the winter's collection of sludge off their races in anticipation of rain. The creek beds are all in full occupation by Chinese, but the ground having been turned over so often, it is almost a matter of surprise that still a living can be made, the more so when it is taken into consideration that the Chinese on festival occasions, seem by no means destitute of the good things of life. Tunnelling. \u2014 In this branch of mining no decided improvements have taken place, but in general where the gutters have been attained the produce is amply sufficient to remunerate parties for their previous labor and expenses. The principal leads through the basaltic hills Alluvial sinking in Yandoit has not during the last month produced anything worthy of remark, in fact the number of parties following this vocation is now very limited. The associated mining companies for work ing of alluvial ground, have all now overcome most of their difficulties, and will soon, I trust, greatly add to the weekly produce of the pre cious metal. Messrs. Harrison and Company's claim is now fairly at work, and the pro prietors have leased Mr. Johnson's race for twelve months. A large quantity of pro mising stuff is landed, and the holders are about getting their sluices ready for washing. ."], [160, "146 MINING SUEYEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 APEIL.

The Grand Junction Company has at length, I believe purchased an engine, and the rest of Yandoit plains are just being taken up by a strong party. to be highly auriferous, and has caused a considerable rush to this place both from the Caledonia gold field and f>om Melbourne. The head of this gully is at the Kangaroo Ground, and is separated from one of the branches of Draper's Gully (mentioned in my last report) by a low ridge running out from the main range of the Kangaroo Ground, the quartz reefs in which are, I have no doubt, the sources of the gold found in both these gullies The sinking in the newly discovered gully known as Swiper's Gully is through about 1 foot of soil, 13 feet of the usual yellow gravelly clay to the washing stuff, which is about 3 feet deep, resting upon hard grey sandstone, making altogether a depth of about 17 feet St. Andrew's Division. (James Murphy, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Occupation. Europeans. Chinese. The gold does not form a regular lead, but lies in patches, therefore the success of the miners is very varied ; some are getting only the color while others are getting as much as 2 oz. to the tub. The average, however, is between 2 and 3 dwt to the tub of four buckets. There is no supply of water for either gold washing or domestic purposes, and all the stuff has to be carted a distance of about a mile to the Diamond Creek. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The want of water is generally very much felt at the first opening of auriferous gullies in this division, but as soon as a number of holes become abandoned, and one or two falls of rain occur the supply of water becomes suf ficient, in every case, for tub washing and domestic use ; and as the abandoned holes increase in number and become filled with rain water from time to time, the supply of water when once established in this way seldom or never fails afterwards. Prospecting is being carried on very exten sively in the numerous gullies between Eltham and the Yarra. and from my knowledge of that part of the country I have no doubt that many of those gullies will be found to be highly auriferous, and capable of affoiding employ ment to a great number of alluvial miners for some years to come. This part of the country is within about IS miles of Melbourne, and if the unemployed of that city will actually work here is an ample field for their exertions, where they can at least obtain a livelihood, and by being holders of miner's rights enjoy the privilege of living rent free, on Crown land, with an ample supply of timber for all the purposes of residence, Sec. In quartz mining very little has been done during the past month. This is owing to the above-mentioned rush, and to the temporary stoppage of the Smythe's (reek Company's crushing machine, while undergoing repairs and alterations. There is now but one crashing machine working for the public in this division, but the miners, with very good reason, have no confidence in its efficiency, as it was originally constructed for grinding brick clay, and not By referring to the foregoing table it will be seen that there has been a very great increase in the mining population of this division during the past month, and at the same time a very great decrease in the number of quartz miners. This fact is owing to a rage for piospecting alluvial ground that has been gradually in- creasing for some time, and to which I alluded in my last report Judging too from results, it has been, up to the present time, more productive than quartz mining as carried on in this division by indi- vidual miners, seeing that in general the amount of work done per day at quartz mining cannot possibly produce payable results. During the past month a very extensive gully, within about two miles of Eltham, and sixteen miles from Melbourne has been found Jluvial miners [uartz miners 111 46 191 823 191 Description.

Many of the miners, therefore, prefer registering their claims until the other machine is in a condition for work ing, and in the meantime turning their atten tion to alluvial mining. The price for crushing at the machine now working is 34s. per ton. Inconsequence of the One-tree Hill Mining Company and the Smythe's Creek Company being amalgamated, it is expected that very extensive mining operations will be commenced within the present month at One-tree Hill. At present there are but seven men employed by this newly foi med company. At Anderson's Creek the quartz miners are suffering not merely inconvenience but loss from want of some means of extracting gold from quartz; and although there are several good reefs in that locality, still the miners are from this cause obliged to refrain from work ing them. There was a hope when Mr. Capper put up a machine there, that the miners would have an opportunity of having their quartz crushed; but Mr. Capper's machine when erected would hardly crash the quartz, and would save but little of the gold, owing to some very defective arrangements. The whole amount of crushing done in this division, during the month of April, was 20 tons of sandstone and quartz from the Yow Yow Hill Mining Company's c'aim. The yield was I oz. to lhe ton, although fully two-thirds of the lot was sandstone.

There is a large area of the Old Yam-hole Diggings which could be sluiced with water from this reservoir. Several parties have made application for leases of alluvial ground, the majority _ of the miners employed in deep-sinking preferring to pay a rent for the ground to holding it under the tenure of a miner's right. The yield of gold in this division 'for the month is estimated at nearly 4000 oz., large quantities of which is not forwarded by escort, but taken by private hands and sold as Ballaa rat gold, for which a higher price is realized. Ae soon as the winter rains commence in earnest, I anticipate a reflux of population from McKinnon's and elsewhere to the shallow diggings, which have been deserted more par ticularly on account of the great scarcity of water during the last summer. The large amount of machinery now in course of erection will greatly assist in shortly developing the supposed hidden treasures of the deep ground in the vicinity of Beaufort Ararat Division. \u2014 Mining prospects in this division are improving. Mitchell's Reef, Ce ment Hill, and Picnic Gully are all yielding their quota of gold, and many of the miners who have remained stationary in these locali ties, as well as several who have returned from McKinnon's and other places, are now reali zing a satisfactory reward for their labor and enterprise. Many miners have returned to Cathcart. Armstrong's and Opossum Gully. \u2014 The prospect of an abundant supply of water at the latter place is attracting the Chinese, many of whom had to leave that locality during the summer months, and have been anxiously waiting for the completion of tb.3 reservoir. The Tunnel Companies on the Canton and other leads are paying satisfactory dividends. The Emu Company have completed a drive of 1 000 feet and have a prospect of from two to three years' profitable work. The Campbell's Keef Quartz Mining Com pany's operations have been retarded, owing to the faulty fixing of the pumps, &c. The poppet heads, &c, recently erected do not reflect much credit on the engineering skill of the district. The Three Crowns and Southern this lead, gave but the poor return of 30s. per man, per week. On the Ding Dong or Cornish Lead there are six claims, the depth of sinking is from 80 to 100 feet, the weekly dividends varying from \u00a33 to \u00a312 per man. Above No. 4 South, and below No. 1 North, this lead is lost. The Garibaldi or Jock's New Lead has not been fairly traced beyond the prospectors' claim. There are five claims at work to the south, two steam engines are erected, and pre parations making to erect others ; the shafts have been bottomed, with one exception, at depths of from 72 to 105 feet, aud obtained prospects varying from 6 to 18 grains to the tub, but none of them have yet reached the gutter. The Garibaldi or Prospect Company bot tomed at a depth of 120 feet, with an average of 2 feet of wash-dirt yielding from 1 oz. to 4 oz. per load; the gutter is 40 feet wide. There are three claims between the pros pectors and the township of Beaufort. The Royal Standard, No 1 North, have bottomed two shafts, at 70 and 80 feet respectively, without success ; they are now engaged in sink ing a third shaft and expect to reach the gutter at about 1 1 5 feet. The Smythesdale Company, No. 2 North, have bottomed near the gutter. and obtained a small prospect. The shaft of No. 3 North is sunk on purchased ground, not bottomed. I understand the owners of small building allotments in the township, which were pur chased for a trifling sum, are exacting most exorbitant sums from miners anxious to sink on their property in order to test this lead. By the dip of the reef this lead appears to be heading for the Allendale Company's claim on the Main Lead. On the New Lead, at the junction of Shep herd's and Cumberland Gullies, known as the Southern Cross, several shafts have been sunk without any payable result The prospectors have only obtained about \u00b1200 worth of gold. The parties in the three adjoining claims are making wages, and those in No. 7, South, have just obtained -J oz of gold from two tubs of wash-dirt. The Anglo Saxon Company, who were al lowed to sink in the police-paddock reserve, north of the Ballaarat road, have bottomed on a reef ; they are erecting a steam engine in order to prove the ground. The three sluicing companies continue to receive regular and fair returns for the capital invested. Cross Claims, on Campbell's Beef, are yielding satisfactory returns. Several claims on this reef are standing still for want of pumping apparatus. The claimholders have made most liberal offers to capitalists to fur nish the necessary machinery, but hitherto they have been unsuccessful. The cement from Londonderry rush, which is carted to and crashed at Campbell's, from four to five miles, yields an average of 2 oz. per load. There are favorable indications in Various minor rushes to Unity Gully and other parts of the division give remunerative employment to those who are termed dry sinkers.

A prospecting party has been formed in Ararat, under the title of, the Ararat Quartz Mining and Prospecting Association. I am not aware of the exact course they propose to pursue, but I believe the development of quartz reefs is their main object. Messrs. William Dickson and party have applied for a lease of four acres of alluvial ground on the Upper Wet Lead, near the township of Ararat. Pleasant Creek Division \u2014 The rash at Four posts continues to attract many, and although the prospecting parties, who are sinking be tween the Fourposts and Glenorchy, have not been so successful as was anticipated. I have no doubt they will ultimately be rewarded for their laborious and persevering efforts. The machinery in the neighborhood of the Deep Lead is fully employed in crushing c ment from the Fourposts. The Cross, Flat, Perthshire, Scotchman's, and other reefs continue to give satisfactory returns. Messrs. Grant, Lamont, and Company have commenced with the erection of powerful pumping machinery, which wUl drain several hundred feet of the Cross Reef. The same party have made application for a lease of six acres of ground for machinery purposes, be tween the New Chum and Cross Reefs ; they intend erecting powerful crushing machinery as speedily as practicable. The New Chum Company, who have secured 1 400 feet of the New Chum Reef, are expected to commence operations shortly. They will require very powerful pumping and crushing machinery. The new rush to Navarre, near the north eastern boundary of the Ararat mining dis trict, has attracted from 3000 to 4000 people. Numerous gullies have been opened with pretty good success The prospectors in Strathloddon Gully obtained a few days ago 6 oz. from ten buckets of wash-dirt; the sinking, which is soft, averages from 10 to 12 feet.

I have the honor to report that during the past month mining operations in this division have been prosecuted with more than ordinary energy, owing. I believe, to the large dividends obtained by the shareholders of the Royal Saxon Company, Inkermann Lead ; Cosmo politan Company, Golden Point Lead; and Great Redan Extended Company, Redan Lead; the average of which has been \u00a325 per week. The tributary lead, stated to have been struck by the Royal Saxon Company in my repSrt of last month, is proving to be very rich ; but from the course it seems to be taking, viz., through private property, the operations ne cessary to the working of it will, in consequence thereof, be very much retarded, and also the information which from time to time, might be obtained as to its real course, &c, will only be obtained with difficulty, if at all. My object in referring to this is for the purpose of show ing the great necessity for some law to legalize mining on private property. There is scarce a lead in Ballaarat which does not more or less pass through private property, indeed some of them are principally situated on such, and in the absence of a law to apply to the disputes that are frequently arising, and also to regu late the' mode of occupation and manner of working, very great inconvenience is experi enced both by the miners and the public gene rally.

The Southern Cross Company, Inkermann Lead have not yet clearly defined the gutter ; but from recent indications it would appear that the lead is on the north side of their shaft. Another party, however, believing that the lead runs southwards, between the Leviathan and Tannery Companies' shafts, towards the Golden Point Lead, have taken up the Tannery shaft, and have commenced to extend the drives made by the Tannery Company to a great distance, for the purpose of thoroughly pros pecting the ground. The Koh-i-noor Company, Golden Point Lead, are engaged with their main drive, for the purpose of reaching the gutter. 1 he length of the drive at present is about 1000 feet. The Albion Company, Frenchman's Lead, have indications of reaching the gutter within a very short period. This company have been actively at work for a space of four years, and have expended a very large amount of capital in boring, sinking, and driving. Now that they are about reaching the lead, and as the company are in possession of very superior plant, so that they can carry out their works on an extensive scale, they no doubt will soon begin to receive some remuneration for their outlay and years of toil. The indications above referred to are as fol lows : at the end of a prospecting drive put in from the main drive, at a depth of 385 feet from the surface, basaltic rock has been struck in the face ; and as it has been found that a table of such rock is immediately over the auriferous deposits in the United Cosmopolitan and Red Jacket Company on the same lead, it may be very reasonably presumed that the gutter will be found under this rock which has been met with.

Their method of raising stone is less ex pensive than that of any other company in my division : commencing on the western side of the hill they have made a cutting of about 35 feet deep almost to the other side of the hill, this cutting, which is almost 300 feet from east to west by 1 17 feet from north to south, binds the entire extent of their claim, and of course saving the expense of lifting. The Combined United Miners' Company are engaged in repairing their machinery, the boiler of which collapsed during the month for want of water. They have amalgamated with the Surprise Company, on Surface Gully, and appear to be now working under better auspices. The Temperance Company are partly en gaged in sinking a new shaft to the intended depth of 160 feet, and partly in crushing ; the new shaft has attained a depth of 120 feet. The shareholders of the Black Hill Com pany are still realizing good dividends. Al though there are only six (6) shareholders in the company, they employ daily seventy-five men and eight horses Their quartz yields about 7 dwt per ton, and still, after paying expenses, leaves them a handsome profit. The Band of Hope Company are still pur suing the even tenor of their way. Their average weekly dividend is from 38 to 50 oz., from about 100 tons. They have at present attained a depth of 120 feet in a new shaft which they intend to sink to 180 feet in depth. Mewley and Company are now engaged in erecting crashing machinery. They had 120 tons crushed last month at the Klack Hill Company's works, which yielded about 135 oz., their former crashing at the same works yielded 2 oz. 13 dwt. per ton, and in one of their levels the reef extends 60 feet in width. The One and All Company have completed the erection of their winding and pumping en gine, and have sunk a new shaft to the depth of 129 feet. They have opened a level at the depth of 126 feet, in which they struck the reef at a distance of 17 feet west from the shaft. The quartz appears to be of the same quality as that in the 60 feet level in the old shaft, which gave an average of 1 oz. per ton. Rickitts and party (now the. Surprise Com pany) are also engaged in erecting crushing machinery of 10^ horse-power, six stamps They had 44 tons crushed last month, which yielded at the rate of 3 oz. 2 gr. per ton They have at present about 600 tons of quartz raised, and they expect to commence crushing operations in about a fortnight. The British United Company are still busy in erecting their machinery, which they expect will be completed in about three weeks. The engine is one of 25 horse-power, with a boiler of 30 feet by 6 feet 6 inches in diameter. The Majestic Company's operations are also satisfactory. They employ thirty-five men. two steam engines \u2014 one of 20 horse-power for quartz crushing, and one of 12 horse power for puddling, and six horses. They are at present engaged in puddling the debris from the Black Hill, which is composed of about one half quartz and the other half schist, and from which they obtain from 4 J to 5 dwt. per ton. What remains in the puddling machine after the sand and earth has been washed away is crushed. The Sisters' Company, on the Band of Hope Reef, are about erecting crushing machinery. They have the framing and foundation timber already on the ground, and have made arrange ments for an engine and stamps, part of which was to have been delivered on 3rd June. The Monte Christo Company have been crushing for the last three weeks at the rate of about 200 tons weekly They are employing now about 30 men daily. The Horn of Plenty, Golden Eagle, and Dimack's Companies, have had frequent trials, all of which have given rather satisfactory returns. The Crocodile Company are also doing well, their last weekly dividend amounting to nearly .\u00a316 per man. The Cumpany employs 13 men and is composed of 1 1 shareholders.

'I he machinery is as follows : \u2014 Springs. \u2014 This locality is in a dormant state at present, both with regard to quartz and alluvial mining ; but, as the reefs on Little Beudigo and Dead Horse are proved, I hope to see its awakening. Alluvial Mining. \u2014 Of alluvial mining in general much cannot be said, save in two or three instances ; sooner than prospect for new ground, they steadily adhere to the old work ings, where some contrive to make men's wages, and the majority to live from hand to mouth The only companies of any importance in this bianch of mining in my district aie the Stock yard Company, on the Eureka Lead, Murray and Company, on Musical Gully, and the Cale donian, on 1 lead Horse. The Stockyard Com pany, of fourteen shareholders, employs an engine of 20 horse-power to work two puddling machines ; average returns, 10 oz. per week Murray mid Company are making good wages working shallow ground close to the source of the Eureka Lead, and when the weather per mits them to work during the six days of the week, they can divide \u00a315 to \u00a320 per man. The Caledonian Company's claim, situated at the junction of Dead Horse and Californian Gullies, continues to pay at the rate of current wages, and not much more; there is an engine woiking two puddling machines on the claim. The state of mining affairs in my district presents very little change, and indeed the nature of the operations carried on affords but little opportunity for anything of a novel description. The progress of quartz mining still con tinues to be satisfactory, though it has of course its failures as well as its successes. To a pe: son who has been absent any length of time from Ballaarat, the changes in this branch of industry would appear very re markable. In the place of the haphazard and rough methods of work employed years ago, we now have the strictest order, combined with a systematic plan of operations. Experiments have been frequently tried, and all that ex perience has taught has been brought, into practical action. Indeed the moderate yield from the quartz in this district has forced our miners into a greater degree of economy than is usually observed in many others, for it is by rigid economy, both of labor and time, that they are able to get remunerative results. The increased faith which is now felt in the permanently remunerative duration of quartz mining is, in this district at least, not the Iu conclusion. I have to inform you that I have spent the greater part of the lust five (5) days acquiring information for this report, and this time has caused a delay in furnishing the plan of the remaining mining portion of the district, the survey of which (working every day) will take at least 12 or 14 days to complete, owing to the scrubby nature of the country to be surveyed.

Notwithstanding, however, all that has been accomplished up to the present time, it may safely be said, that quartz mining has by no means reached its greatest development. When the machines now in use shall have been worn out, and the mines now being worked shall have been opened to a much greater depth, it will then be seen that the best paying operations are those which are of the greatest magnitude, for with powerful ma chinery the natural obstacles will be most effectually overcome. In saying this, I am not overlooking the im portance of a thoroughly efficient amalgamator, but am only desirous of pointing out what can be done by being careful of the means actually at the command of every mining company ; \u2014 there is a tendency to seek _ in novelty what must be found in care. By increasing the area of work we can in crease the yield of gold, but we may wait for sntisfactory inventions for years, and then not find our hopes realized. The experience which we have now gained shows that quartz lodes may be worked to a very great depth without the yield of gold falling off. I have been led to make these remarks by the discarding of one amalgamator, and the introduction of another. So far we speak from experience rela tive to the comparatively great depth at which quartz lodes are now being worked, but a theoretical belief is held here by many ex perienced miners, that the qu irtz of Ballaarat will be found to increase in rii hness as a greater depth is attained. The Eureka Cement Company have decided to no longer employ Manuel's amalgamator, whilst a Mr. James 1 'ixon has taken out a patent for a new one. The reasons that led to the abandonment of Manuel's amalgam dor, I cannot precisely state, but the company have decided that they gain nothing by it. On this latter point I am, of course, unable to give an opinion. I mention the belief as one that is worthy of notice, because it has not been hastily taken up, and because it is in some measure the result of experience. The invention of Mr. Dixon consists of a cylinder revolving over a fire, round the outside of which two pipes are placed so bent as to act as a feed and discharge pipe. The tailings are thus conveyed to the interior of the cylinder, where they come in contact with heated mer cury and are carried away through the discharge pipe. WTiether it be true or not, it has a tendency to give a degree of permanence to quartz mining operations, and to engender faith in the works now being carried on. I am of course unable to give an opinion on the merits of this invention, which has not I believe been practically tested. In connection with quartz mining the ques tion of a better method of amalgamation is one that deserves great attention, though it may be remarked that it has already perhaps absorbed an undue share. The real advance that will be made in quartz mining must be primarily \u2014 the increasing the area of work ; and in a second degree, only by increasing the efficiency of the methods employed. In alluvial mining 1 have no change to report beyond the fact that a large number of claims are being taken up by the Chinese, and a somewhat smaller number of Europeans, working larger areas, and consequently not requiring new claims so often. If the amalgamators of which we have heard so much were all that they have been described, they still would give but a small impetus to mining industry, unless the area of work was increased. No. 4 Division. (Michael O'Malley, Mining Surveyor.) The quantity of tailings available would soon be exhausted, and attention would have to be given to the opening up of new lodes, or the more systematic working of old ones. The population is as follows : \u2014 Moreover, it may be pointed out, that a careful application of known appliances will be found to serve the purpose of ext acting all or nearly all the gold from the crushed quartz.

At Little Hard Hills two or three companies still find remunerative employment at working the cement found in their claims, but from the slow process here in vogue (hand-crushing) they are not able to realize, on an average, much more than the ordinary amount of wages.

The Don Juan stands well for the Ivanhoe gutter. The Menai Straits have got as high as 30 oz. to the machine from their new shaft. A great number of the claims on the private property (Preston's Hill) are paying first-rate. At Linton's the same uncertainty prevails still in regard to the course of the Standard Lead. The workings of the Atlas Company have not yet furnished much data towards the solution of the problem ; neither has this company got much yet to reimburse them for the vast outlay which they have had. Cheswick Division. (James Stevenson, Mining Surveyor.) The popidation is as follows : \u2014 The Pioneer Company, in Linton's paddock, have not got anything yet; nor have the John Bull Company bottomed. There is great doubt whether the Standard goes through the pad dock or the Atlas claim. The Duke of Cornwall is doing well, and the Edinburgh beginning to pay splendidly \u2014 30 oz. to the machine is not an unusual thing. Nearly the same may be said of the Glamor gan and Little Wonder claims. There are some claims up towards the high end of the Standard Lead that give as high as \u00a350 per man weekly. This lead has been without comparison the most prolific iu this district. The Redan and Johu Bull claims, on the Black Lead, have shown no change from their usual state, which is something from \u00a33 to \u00a35 per week. -In quartz mining nothing has been yet done about Linton's, to warrant an opinion on its quartz bearing capabilities.

The Bald Hills Lead continues to pay very well, it has now been proved that the rich ground worked by the Homeward Bound Company is a distinct gutter from the one worked by the prospectors ; four claims have been taken up on this branch gutter, from one of which, the party have obtained from half a bucket of wash-dirt upwards of eleven ounces ; four new claims have also been taken up on the supposed course of the old lead. During the month the Homeward Bound Company (9 men) have washed out 226 oz ; the Sons of Justice (10 men) 115 oz.; the Garibaldi Company (8 men) for half the month 58J oz ; the prospectors who have for sometime been engaged in sinking a new shaft and driving, have also again struck the lead and got 7_| oz. last week. The Enterprise Company have crushed from the 22nd April to 25th May, 410 tons tailings, yielding 48 oz. 18 dwt, or an average of 2 dwt 9j gr. person ; also 63 tons of cement, yielding 36 oz. 3 dwt., or an average of 1 1 dwt. 11^ gr. per ton ; this company also crushed 14 tons of quartz from a new reef at Cobbler's Gully, which only yielded 22 dwt. of gold. The Clark's Flat Crushing Company have crushed 600 tons of cement tailings, which yielded 93 oz. 18 dwt. 17 gr., or an average of 3 dwt. 1 1 gr nearly ; this company are about to dispose of their small battery and use that engine for raising cement. The Clark's Hill Company have got their battery in good working order ; the result of their first crushing is 240 tons of tailings, yield 18 oz. 18 gr., or an average of 1 dwt 12| gr. per ton. The Frenchman's Quartz Mining Company have got their si. aft now down to 182 feet; this company crushed in 190 tons of quartz, yielding 59 oz 1 dwt 18 gr., or an average of 6 dwt. 6 gr per ton. The result of the gold workings at Chines is at present very satisfactory, the dividends from those companies who are established are con stantly increasing. The Clunes Company have published during the month their half yearly report, which under the direction of their manager, Mr. C. J.

At Ironstone Hill. Slaty Creek, some more claims have been bottomed, but no prospect sufficient to pay has been obtained, conse quently most of them have been abandoned, four claims have however been proved good and are paying well, and will I have no doubt be the means of tracing the gold at some future time. At Bullarook the Werribee Fly Company, on the Rocky Lead, have bottomed a new shaft 89 feet in depth ; first through 12 feet of chocolate soil, then through 7 feet of yellow clay, then through 1 8 feet of honeycomb rock, then through 12 feet of black clay (this clay had pieces of gum similar to the gum found on the native timber intermixed with it), then through 16 feet of clay intermixed with shells, thence through two feet of lava to the bottom or reef, through which they have sunk 22 feet, having opened a drive at this depth, they struck the gutter 45 feet from the shaft, the average yield from which is 2 J dwt. per tub. Four ad ditional claims have been surveyed, all of which combined extend above a mile in length. Two men, working in the old ground at Bullarook, have erected a water wheel for driving a puddling machine, which works admirably ; they obtain about 6 oz. weekly. A party have also taken up a surface claim here to work with a steam puddling machine. The Hard Hill Crushing Company have crashed 700 tons of tailings, &c, which yielded 108 oz., or an average of 3 dwt. 5$ gr. per ton.

Application has been made to the warden for a lea-.e of the same ground by some well known enterprising men on this field who are well acquainted with its capa bilities, or rather certain productiveness, and have an engine ready to place on the ground on the lease being granted to them. This block. 100 by 80 yards, lies between the claims of the Perseverance and Steiglitz Company's ground, and owing to the constant pumping of the latter many rich blocks of quartz can now be worked without the former difficulties of water. The Steiglitz Company are still continuing sinking their main shaft, and have struck a very rich vein at their lowest depth, 300 feet. The vein, up to that time had been broken or split up in small straggling spurs and present ing no very encouraging prospects, but on sinking through a very large and exceedingly hard mass of mica schist the vein was found as above, being evidently displaced by the vertical and horizontal slides referred to in a diagram sent your Board some time since (of Boxing Reef). Had the Perseverance Company fol lowed my advice given before they commenced operations they would now, I am positive, be obtaining good and payable quartz, as they have persisted in following all their time a poor and barren vein, having no connection with, and having different, component parts from that now obtained by the Steigl tz Company. I am happy to state that the Gibraltar Com pany have again commenced operations with the greatest energy ; their engine 30 horse power, is now on the ground, and works in connection, in course of erection They intend fixing pumps and other apparatus, &c., to work the ground thoroughly and efficiently, which. owing to previous difficulties of limited means, small machinery, and difficulties of water, they were before unab'e to do. Their vein at their lowest depth was a good, payable, and large one. and their claim adjoins the Malakhoff at whose lowest depth, 350 feet, their richest quartz has been obtained. The Redan Company, New Chum Reef, are at present busily engaged in crushing up all the clay slate and mica schist taken from near and adjoining the auriferous quartz veins, and raised to the surface by the old proprietors of the claim ; it yields a good dividend after paying all expenses of carting, labor, &c. and it is calculated that in addition to the heaps now lying en the old claims and hitherto con sidered as mullock, that there are some thou sands of tons below, where the old workings have been filled in. The crushing mill of Messrs. Pyke and Trench are getting through about 400 tons per week of this mullock. The New Chum Company, leased by Messrs. Pyke and Trench, have completed their ma chinery, which has hitherto proved satisfactory in every respect as to saving gold and power of Since my last report mining matters in this division are gradually improving both in quartz and alluvial mining, and judging from the energetic steps being taken by some of the largest companies on this field there is every probability that, in a few months, Steiglitz will be in a very prosperous condition from the fact that very rich quartz is now being obtained from the greatest depths sunk. The Sailors' Reef Company are raising and stacking very large masses of quartz. This company have purchased a large engine of 30 horse- power and intend erecting a battery of 12 stampers ; the contracts are taken and the work will be completed by the 1st August next They have applied for an extension of their leased ground from 300 yards to 600 yards in length. By the time their machinery is erected many hundred of tons of quartz will be awaiting crushing from their reef as it is a very large one and many hands are now em ployed on it. The Union Company still idle, owing to the difficulty of tracing the vein from the Birming ham Reef prospect to their ground owing to a slide in the strata, they have suspended their operations as they deem it hazardous to con tinue prospecting until the vein is traced fur ther north into their ground They have already sunk two shafts but with no success. The Perseverance Company have suspended operations for some time, their capital is ex pended and with no returns.

The Morning Star Company, Victoria Reef. are still steadily and energetically pursuing their operations ; they have many tons of quartz raised and awaiting crushing, but owing to an accident to their shear legs, over main shaft, they have been detained for a little time. awaiting a crushing ; judging from the quartz in the kilns they will pay well. A new vein called the Eureka Vein has been found about a hundred yards east of the Wellington Reef; the specimens I have seen are very good, and the ground well settled; there is every promise of its permanency. The Daylight Reef Company are raising quartz which will yield at least 4 to 5 oz per ton ; this reef has been abandoned for some long time ; they have also some tons of quartz awaiting crashing. '1 he Devonshire Reef Company is at present registered ; this lies south of Wellington Reef, across the gully, and owing to the promising appearance of the Eureka Reef, east, they are prospecting their ground for the latter. The Far North Company registered for three months owing to difficulties of water. The Homeward Bound Prospect Claim at present engaged in crashing at the Blackwood machine, they have only a small quantity, 10 tons or thereabouts, which they believe will average from 7 to 8 oz. The New Year's Reef Prospect Claim have about 30 tons of quartz now at the Blackwood machine to be crushed ; the last average was 10 to 11 oz. per ton, and these look equally well. The Albion Company are raising very good quartz ; they have erected their own crushing machinery and are now busily engaged in crushing. Owing to the unwillingness of the proprietors of the ground to give information as to proceeds, I cannot state with certainty the yield, but judging from the stone it must be good. The Norfolk Reef Company still idle. Private and Co-operative Companies. \u2014 Gar- lick's Reef Prospect Claim have lately crushed 50 tons of quartz, which averaged 10 oz. pet- ton. This will pay well when the Sailors' Reef Company's machinery is erected, as the price of cartage and the distance from any crushing machine takes away a large margin of profit ; the reef is south of and adjoining Sailors' Reef, and two miles from Steiglitz. The Ironbark Reef has been again taken up, aud a crushing of some many tons ob- tained, the yield was 1 J oz per ton ; this is very encouraging to the present proprietors, as the reef was an abandoned one, but still is large and close to a crushing machine. The Birmingham Reef Prospect Claim, as I informed you in my last report, had found their lost vein ; they are following it north, but have not stripped it down yet, however, it promises very favorably. The Malakhoff Company are obtaining very rich quartz at their lowest depth Their operations are still continued in their usual steady and persevering manner, against many- difficulties, which will be overcome when the Gibraltar commences operations. The Wellington Reef Company are at pre- sent awaiting the crushing of their quartz at the Blackwood machine; they have over 50 tons, and expect from 5 to 6 oz. per ton, judging from the last yields I may mention here that many tons of quartz have not been crushed for some time, owing to alterations and additions to the said machine, which has up to this time proved itself very effective, and has been considered the best on this field for saving fine gold. No. 1 South on same reef are obtaining very rich quartz but are much troubled with water. The Scotchman's Reef is still being worked but with what results I am unable to tell. In alluvial mining the flat west of the town ship is at present engaging a small number of men who get I believe wages. The gully west of Sailors' Reef has been comparatively abandoned, owing to the great difficulty in tracing the lead or gutter. I am happy to state that the alluvial mining on Morrison's, the Tea-tree Creek, Kastern Moorabool, Dolly's Creek and the Table land, are in a very flourishing condition during the past month. On Morrison's, the tunnels made the greatest distance, 400 to 500 feet into the hill are get ting richer stuff than ever known before ; in some claims \u00a310 to \u00a312 per man is being obtained A fresh ran of gold has been found on the Eastern Moorabool, leading from Morrison's, but on the opposite side of the river leading to Wallace's ; the country is of the same charac ter, and the wash-dirt similar to that found at Morrison's ; in the event of this ran being found to exist up the Eastern Moorabool for some length, it is impossible to state what an enormous extent of auriferous ground will be opened and developed On Tea-tree Creek, at the end of the longest tunnel, 423 feet, the claim has been paying the proprietors, Felse, Marsh and Company, \u00a37 to \u00a38 per week, and all the other claims are giving good wages where properly worked. The Ballaarat Reef Prospect Claim are now"], [181, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS MAY. 165 On the basin a shaft has been sunk to the depth of 300 feet through one mass of washed quartz and conglomerate and have not yet bottomed ; this is one of the most extraordinary geological phenomena I ever knew in alluvial gold mining. As this 300 feet is below the bottom worked on the Tea-tree tunnels, and where the gold is found, it seems to me to be the crater of some extinct volcano filled in by the quartz debris, &c, from the adjoining hills. The party engaged in sinking this shaft have been compelled to stay operations until they have completed their arrangements for pro curing machinery to contend with the water. On Dolly's Creek a new rush has taken place on the table land leading to the Tea-tree Creek ; many of the shafts have bottomed at 10 to 15 feet deep, and the average yield is 1 oz. per load, this pays well as water is near at hand and cartage reasonable ; finding gold here, and in precisely similar wash-dirt, con firms me in my opinion, long held, that at some future day, the whole of the table land encircled hy the Moorabool. Dolly's Creek aud Tea-tree Creek, will be found to be a continued auriferous deposit. Another addition has been made during the month to the machinery by the erection of a water wheel and crushing machine The ap proximate value of all machinery is now, therefore, increased to \u00a322.000. Quartz Reefs \u2014 There has been a good deal of increased activity manifested generally in this department for the last month. In some instances, where water wheels are employed, this has been caused by an abundant sup ply of water ; and in others where prepara tions were being made for extended workings having been completed. In some cases, how ever, unfortunately, there still remains a great degree of inaction from want of capital. The resources iu quartz reefs are abundant in Blackwood, and amply remunerative were capital invested and judiciously applied in their development Simmons Reef. \u2014 The Imperial Company have been doing a good deal of work during the month; their average crushing about 140 tons of quartz per week, and the average yield 1 3 -J dwt of gold to the ton. Their prospects con tinue good, and they are preparing for more ex tensive workings by sinking their shaft deeper. The Lerdeiberg Company's operations are still confined to sinking their shaft, to intersect the reef at a deeper level. There being no quartz to crush, the machinery is at a stand. The Cornish Company have been pretty regularly at. work through the month, having had an abundant supply of water for their wheel. Their average crushing is about 80 tons of quartz per week, and the yield of gold about 4 dwt to the ton. Their yield has seldom, for a long time exceeded this ; and yet even this produces them a fair margin of profit, although their machine, being propelled by water power, is idle full four months in the year. This fact, I th'nk. pretty clearly exem plifies what may be done in the Blackwood quartz reefs by mining skill and capital well applied. Appleton Brothers, having finished their tunnel, have been at work through the greatest part of the month. These parties, although on a small scale, are about the most steady in their operations of any in the district Their average yield during the mouth has been 1 5 dwt. of gold to the ton ; they crush about 60 tons weekly of stone. Trewhella's Reef. \u2014 Trewhella Brothers have not crushed during the month, having been engaged in raising quartz of which they have now a good stock. Sherwood and Company, now called the \" Robin Hood Company,\" for the last month have exceeded all others in point of yi-ld, it being 1 oz. of gold to the ton of stone on the average; they have a batteiy of 12 stamps, driven by a powerful water wheel, capable of crashing 140 tons weekly. Their prospects in the mine are still improving. The Chinamen are busily engaged in washing up the old workings, tailings, headings, &c, left for some long time on Brown's Hill ; they have applied for a large block claim which has been measured off and registered to them. From all reports they are doing well. Blackwood Division. (Thomas Hay, Mining Surveyor.)

The Pioneer Company. \u2014 The crashings of this company have not come up quite to the yield of previous months ; but it is still good, and, from appearances, likely to continue. The average for the month is about 10 dwt. to the ton. Martin's Crashing Machine. \u2014 The patentee claims his patent from the mode of attaching the engine to the machine, which is done by fixing both on the same large iron bed, and by this, giving firmness and stability to the whole fabric. This machine is composed of twelve stampers, of 700 lbs weight each, placed in a cast-iron circular case or tub, so to call it, which is 32 in. high and 4J feet in diameter, fastened to the bed. In the sides of this tub are six square holes, grated, to discharge the tadings. To the foundation bed are fixed six cast-iron round pillars, about 9 feet high ; to these pillars, about a foot above the top of the tub, is a flat iron ring, and bored with twelve round holes, and at the top of the pillars afore mentioned is another ring similar. These holes in the rings receive the stamp rods and act as guides to them, and through which the rods are made to slide up and down in the act of crushing. On each of the stamp rods is a check fixed to receive the cam to lift the stamp. This constitutes the framework of the machine, presenting to the view something of the appearance of a shower bath without the curtain, and thus is the force and action of 12 ponderous stamps concentrated in the small space of a circle only 4^ feet in diameter. In the centre, between the stamp rods is placed a circular cast-iron drum, or as it is denominated, the cam disk, 3 feet 3 inches diameter, and 20 inches high, revolving on a vertical iron shaft. The upper rim of this drum has three deep notches, which occupy its entire circumference. These notches are formed somewhat like the teeth of ahandsaw, thus N tx, so that, as the disk is made to revolve, the diagonal of the notch catches the check of the stamp rod and slides it to the apex, from which it drops per pendicularly and thus is the crushing action complete. The disk, in so lifting the stamper by the check on its rod, causes it to revolve half a turn each stroke, thus giving to the machine a grinding as well as a crushing effect. The machine is propelled by a 16 horse-power en gine with an oscillating cylinder, the piston-rod of which being attached to a crank, gives motion to a horizontal iron shaft reaching across the machine between the pillars and stamp rods On this shaft is fixed a pinion wheel, gearing to a cog wheel at the bottom of the cam disk, from which the disk receives its rotary motion and by which the whole machine is put into action. There is nothing peculiarly different in the arrangement of this machine from the ordinary rule, except the stamps which, instead of being cast into one solid lump of iron, are shod,\u2014 that is, there is a piece of iron fixed to the bottom of each stamp to receive the wear in the operation of crushing, and when this is worn out it is removed and replaced by a new shoe. This is a matter of no trifling consi- The United Company have had some crash ings during the month, the average yield of which was about 12 dwt. of gold to the ton of stone. Hewson's Reef. \u2014 This company, Hewson and Company, are going on under favorable prospects, having finished their tunnel to un water the mine, they have struck into a good reef which seems to improve as they advance. They have had some crashing during the month, and the average, although under great disadvantages, has been full 8 dwt to the ton of stone. The position of this mine is unques tionably advantageous. Garihaldi Reef. \u2014 The parties who took a large claim on this reef have not as yet struck it, but are at work sinking a shaft. The other claims are quite at a stand, the holders having exhausted their means, as well as those on Wilson's Reef, which lies on a parallel with this at a distance of about 4 chains, and thus are two rich reefs lying completely dormant for the want of capital to erect machinery. Johnson's Reef. \u2014 The Caledonian Company are still moving with spirit, and the average yield from their erushings amounts to about 1 7 dwt. to the ton of epiartz. In alluvial diggings, sluicing is displaying a very active aspect, and generally doing very well. In the Pyrette Gully, on the Gisborne road from Bacchus Marsh, some diggers are doing extremely well, while others, from the gold being patchy, are obliged to put up with duffers, and these form the majority. There has been a good deal of prospecting in this locality, but not with a favorable result as yet. In my report for March, I had to mention the find of two nuggets in Long Gully, of the respective weights of 7 oz. and 18 oz. I have now to record two other lucky finds in Nuggety Gully, being the next to Long Gully, by two nearly adjoining claimholders. One of these dug out a nugget weighing 23 oz., but as it had quartz attached to it, only weighed 19 oz. of pure gold when the quartz was removed. The other nugget was free from quartz and weighed 1 5 oz. pure gold. In addition to this, a quantity of small gold was also found and is still being found.

These runs have, in consequence of the increased supply, been led on to the Red Hill, top of Pennyweight Flat, and are being used two or three times over in sluicing ground that formerly had been worked by sinking and driving. Also, on the Red Hill, at the Two-mile, and on Napoleon Flat, Woolshed Creek, sluicing claims have increased in number and activity. At Paddy's Gully, in Bowman's Forest, they have been enabled to wash up the dirt they had been saving for some time back. The Perseverance and German Leads are still languishing. BEECHWORTH MINING DISTRICT. At the El Dorado, Hutchins' party are doing well, having a 16 and a 10 horse-power engine, the one for draining aud the other for hauling; notwithstanding they took a whole year to sink 42 feet, in consequence of water troubling them so much, they can now keep it under with ease. Spring Creek, Three-mile, and Woolshed Divisions. (Henry Grimes, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The adjoining and lower claim of Kneebone's has now this difficulty to contend with \u2014 they are unable to work as yet the upper end of their claim at a depth of 52 feet ; they have been trying wash-dirt at a depth of 30 feet, but which is too poor to work at a profit. McEvoy's claim at a depth of 212 feet is troubled with too much wash-dirt ; a lead of 300 feet by 15 feet deep, with the gold sparsely diffused through the mass, makes the returns much less than was anticipated. Kenyon's claim has been driven upwards of 400 feet from the one shaft in endeavoring to cross the lead, but have not as yet succeeded. To supply air to the workmen at the end of the drive, the simple but efficient process of attaching a pipe to the funnel of the high pressure engine, and leading it to the end of the drive (the hot air and upward force of the steam causing a vacuum), make a draft more than sufficient. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Wellington's party have sunk 130 feet in their second shaft, and have been driving, but have not come upon the lead as yet. On Snake's Lead, or (as the miners are calling it) Serpentine Creek, which joins the Wooragee Creek, at the crossing of the Indigo road, several sluicing claims have been taken up ; the prospect is about a pound of black sand to the dish, and only 2 oz. of gold to the ton of black sand, consequently the latter will be the chief object of the workings. At Wooragee Flat the parties out prospect ing have not as yet been very successful ; only one party has come in and declared to me they have found payable ground. From the late rains a sufficient supply of water has been obtained, and those parties whose runs have been dry or nearly so during Messrs.

A great inducement to parties prospecting is the large extent of ground allowed by the bye-laws to prospectors, making them sure, if the ground turn out payable, of at least from three to five years' steady work. Another party are prospecting in a place known as Rats Castle, on a creek called House Creek, running into the Murray near Wodonga. They have bottomed on the side of the reef, very wet, but yet with a fair prospect, a grain and a half to the dish, and intend sinking for the glitter.

The population in this division is at present on the decrease, a considerable number of miners who were for the most part engaged in sluicing operations having left for the gold fields on the Upper Goulburn and other places. On the Buckland River many of the allu vial miners have been principally engaged in cleaning out and repairing the races. The supply of water is now plentiful, as there has been a very heavy rainfall during the greater part of the month. Most of the claims on the Buckland continue to pay good wages, and more especially so on the Lower Flat, where some parties have been making from \u00a38 to \u00a320 per man per week On the Nelson Reef, Messrs. Tracy and Company are continuing to raise quartz, but they have not yet commenced crushing. From the appearance of the stone lately raised, I fear that this company will be but poorly re munerated for their outlay. On Murray's Reef the prospectors are still sinking, they state that to a depth of 50 feet they have good quartz, and should they suc ceed in striking a good reef at a greater depth they will erect water-power machinery for crashing. The quartz reef on Maguire's Flat has been abandoned, the water being too heavy to drain without steam-power, which there does not appear to be sufficient inducement to erect. There have been seven new prospecting claims registered on newly discovered, and two on abandoned reefs, during the month of May, which have been named, and are situated as follows, viz. : \u2014 The Magpie Reef, situate near the West Briton, Ovens River; the Bon Accord, near the Hit-or-Miss, Ovens River ; the Lone Star, near Richardson's ; the Glou cester, near the Oriental ; the Alice, near the Pioneer. The above are only small views at present, and are not yet sufficiently defined for any opinion to be formed of their value. The Garibaldi. \u2014 This reef was formerly known by the name of the Poor Man's Reef, and it has been again taken up with good prospects ; a number of very rich specimens of surface quartz were found nearly two years ago on this reef by Mr. Gander, of Gander's Reef Company, and that gentleman caused a shaft to be sunk for the reef, and although a large body of quartz was struck, it proved nearly non-auriferous and was abandoned. Since that time several other parties have un successfully prospected it. Now, however, it appears that the gold bearing view was not struck by them. The present prospectors found on the surface some more rich speci mens, and have now struck a leader which appears likely to form into a Etrong reef, and gold is visible throughout it. The Growler's Creek Reef is a large body of quartz, situated about half a mile below Gander's ; as yet no gold has been seen in the stone. At present no other claims besides the prospectors have been taken up on any of the above mentioned reefs. Butchart's Reef is situate about 100 yards east of the Pioneer : on this two claims are taken up, and the reef is about 3 feet in thick ness and shows a little gold in the surface stones ; it is also remarkably well situated for economical working, being in a low range and near to abundant water-power. The Bellville Reef is situate on the east side of Morse's Creek, and about three-quarters of a mile west of Gander's. On this reef these claims are occupied in addition to the pros pector's. There is a large body of surface quartz cropping ont, but the gold is found at present in a leader running parallel to it. This leader is very rich, and has been struck in two claims. I think it likely, judging from the appearance of the surface quartz, that a very good reef will be struck, but no very accurate opinion can be formed yet, as the dis covery only took place during the last week. Quartz mining generally, in this division, continues very prosperous, and more machinery is being erected by Messrs. Wood and Company of the Oriental. This company are erecting a water wheel of 20 horse-power, which will drive four batteries of wet stampers of four heads each. '1 hey are now raising more quartz from their claim than can be crushed by their present machinery, as the latter is also crushing the quartz from No. 2 South on the Oriental; iu which claim a very good reef has at last been struck. I am informed that Messrs. Wallace and Company also intend to put up a powerful machine to be worked by water power. I beg to submit the following general information respecting the reefs in my division, which are now yielding payable returns. The Oriental. \u2014 Messrs. Wood and Company have struck a reef three feet in thickness in their tunnel, but it is apparently non-auriferous, as yet, however, the tunnel is not in far enough to strike the main reef, should it continue its present easterly dip ; it is therefore probable that the reef which has been struck is the continuation of the front reef of the Oriental, which on the surface runs parallel to it at a distance of about 30 feet to the westward. Messrs. Wood and Company continue to raise large quantities of payable quartz from their surface workings. From No. 1 North, Wallace and Company have struck a good patch of surface quartz which has averaged 2 oz. 10 dwt per ton. and that now being raised continues to look well, Messrs. Cotsworth and Company. No. 1 South, are still raising good quartz, which considering the size of the reef from 8 to 1 7 feet wide may be considered rich. There is now a very good reef in No. 2 South, 4 feet in width, and payable throughout. No. 3 South is registered on account of"], [187, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 MAY. 171 excessive drainage, but should a payable reef be struck in the tunnel being driven in to the prospecting claim, another tunnel will at once be driven in No. 3 sufficiently low to drain a considerable portion of the reef in this claim. No. 4 South Company are still driving for the reef. No. 1 South on the Home Reef are continuing to raise very good quartz ; the vein is not yet very large but is solid and with well defined walls; the quartz now being raised is taken from a depth of about 60 feet and is expected to yield fully 6 oz. per ton. The prospectors have not yet struck any defined view but have several small leaders all gold bearing and apparently inclining to each other. Two other claims No. 2 South and No. 1 North are being prospected. On Richardson's Reef (prospecting claim) the deeper workings are just at present too poor to work with much profit, therefore this com pany have been engaged in removing the re mainder of the surface quartz which has yielded well. The reef continues to hold well, although it is poor, Messrs. Richardson will therefore continue to sink and probably the yield will again improve. The prospecting claim on the Albion Reef is continuing to improve ; the reef is now from 2 to 3 feet wide and payable throughout ; the last yie'd was 2 oz. per ton. No. 1 North have also the reef, but at present it is not sufficiently payable, this reef being situated 2^ miles from the nearest machine. The prospectors on the William Tell have struck a good surface view about 2 feet wide, a trial crashing from which averaged 3 oz. No. 1. North is now occupied on this line. Brenkman's Reef. \u2014 The prospectors are still raising good quartz and the reef is from 3 to 4 feet in width. No other claim has yet struck the reef. McNulty's. \u2014 The prospectors are continuing to raise payable stone, and the reef is from 18 inches to 3 feet in thickness. This party have now raised a large quantity of quartz which will shortly be crushed. No. 1 North on this reef, which had been abandoned is now re occupied, and a reef showing a little gold, 6 feet in width, has been struck. The Duke of Northumberland prospecting claim continues to yield good quartz, a parcel of which is now being crushed. The reef is more solid than it formerly was, and is widening out as the workings become deeper. The prospecting claim on the Hampton Reef also continues to yield rich quartz, but although the shaft is down 120 feet there is no appear ance of any increase of bulk in the vein, consequently a small quantity only is raised. The Pioneer \u2014 The prospectors of this reef are at last rewarded for nearly two years' labor aud expense by the discovery of a very good reef in their claim. The vein is about 2 feet in thickness and a crushing of 60 tons has averaged nearly 7 oz. Claim No. 1 South is in consequence re-occupied. The White Star. \u2014 During this month a great improvement has taken place in this reef, a large body of quartz has been struck which is expected to turn out as well as the best of the late crushings, and the reef has every appear ance of permanence. No. 1 South are still driving for the reef. Gander's Reef. \u2014 The stone raised this month from the prospecting claim has turned out better than the last, while that from No. 1 South is not quite so good. The reef is from 4 to 6 feet wide and payable throughout. No. 2 South are still sinking. Scandinavian.\u2014 A trial crushing of 25 tons from the prospecting claim has averaged 2 oz per ton and the reef is 3 feet wide, and that yield was obtained from the entire bulk Two other claims are prospecting for the reef. Falkner's Reef Growler's Creek.\u2014 There has been a small crushing of good stone from the surface reef, but both the prospectors and Stephens and Company arc still unsuccessful in striking any second reef. The Pennyweight Reef (prospecting claim) is now a large body of quartz fully 6 feet in thickness ; a large quantity of surface quartz has lately been raised, which is expected to yield 10 dwt. per ton, which will pay well if crashed by water power. The prospectors in form me that the quartz is also looking very much better in the south end of the claim, which they are now working deeper. The Victoria Prospecting Claim is still yielding good quartz, but the reef is at present much broken and the walls badly defined ; a small quantity only is being raised as the prospectors are sinking to prove the extent of the present view preparatory to driving a tunnel. Falkner's, Ovens River. \u2014 The prospectors' claim is now in full working order and the reef about 2 feet wide, the stone lately crushed yielded well and a considerable improvemeut has taken place in the prospects of this reef. At one time lately a large portion of it ran out but has since come in again and levels are open through nearly half of the claim (160 yards). No. 1 North are sinking with every prospect of shortly striking the reef. No. 1 South which had been abandoned is now re occupied. The Hibernian Reef. \u2014 The prospectors' claim is still being sunk upon; but the large reef lately struck has again run out, leaving, however, a well defined back wall. The greater part of the surface quartz that is at all payable is removed. No. 1 North is abandoned for the present. No reef has yet been struck on the Woolshed claim since my last report; and on the West Briton but very little quartz is being raised."], [188, "172 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS MAY. Messrs. Stephens and Company's machine has consequently been standing idle all the month, The Rose. Thistle, and Shamrock Reef and the Hit or Miss, continue highly payable ; 200 tons from the Rose, Thistle, and shamrock yielded 188 oz. of gold, or nearly 2 oz. per ton Owing to the absence of the manager I have not yet received any return from the Hit or Miss, but I am indirectly informed that the yield continues good. Heap's Reef has run out, and all the payable surface stone has been removed, consequently it has been abandoned. The following table shows the quantity of quartz crushed, and the average yield for the month of May :\u2014 The machinery is as follows : \u2014 In my division of this gold field mining is steadily and prosperously progressing in all its branches. In the alluvial, the puddlers, with all the appliances brought to bear now, make but passable poor ground, and even that which has been more than once turned over, remunerate them. Every inch of available ground is being worked, also those blocks of ground which have been thrown open by the dissolution of the many steam puddling com panies, are found to pay individually very well, by which method I find employment is given to a greater number of men than ever the com panies could conveniently or lucratively have employed. Many rich leads have lately been discovered by trying the ground to the right and left of the old workings; imagining that they were upon the main and only lead, the miners formerly never troubled themselves to further prospect the ground. I am of opinion that in one-half the claims at present held the main reef, or at least the most lucrative one, has not yet been struck ; it is this uncertainty which maintains the interest of the gold fields.

When this quality of stone was first struck it was only a few inches upon the west face of the reef, yielding ten ounces per ton, gradually merging diagonally into the mass, and eventually yielding all over about 3 oz. per ton. Moon and Company have 1000 oz. amalgam for ten days' crushing ; they intend crushing another week before retorting off, expecting at least 800 oz of gold.

Tyson's Reef. \u2014 There are three claims to gether upon this line doing well, the most southern of which is the Tyson's Reef Company ; they are draining the line very effectually at a very great expense, and unfortunately only one claim of 20 yards pays assessment. Bird's Reef. \u2014 This is a short line of reef so far as has at present been worked, but more favored I may say than any other line on Sandhurst (Victoria excepted) in having two pumping engines ' within the distance of 300 yards of each other, one is the Bird's Reef Company, the other Le Capelain Company : and should there exist (as I have not the slightest doubt there does), a good payable reef at a reasonable depth below water level, it is but reasonable to suppose that with such appliances, if any, and the perseverance and determination of all concerned, that the deside ratum will be obtained; it is rather alarming but too true, as proved here, that one pumping engine is quite inadequate to the drainage of a long line of reef, and on some I feel positive that six will not be unreasonable. There are very few pumping engines now at work on Bendigo, if anyr. from which very material benefit has been derived above 300 yards along the line, but certainly no great depth has yet been attained. Eaglehawk and Huntlt Division. (G. W. Hart, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Le Capelain and Company last week struck two fine spurs leading off from the main reef and underlying west, from which 40 tons were crushed yielding 1 56 oz. being about 4 oz. per ton ; this appears to continue along, and also to carry its depth ; it was struck just a few feet below the surface. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Many of the outside reefs are now at work with more or less remunerative results, and many that have been long abandoned as unre munerative are daily re-occupied and found payable in the present day. Glasgow Reef. \u2014 This line is progressing ; several claims north and south are paying very well above water level, but the majority of them are idle, waiting the results of the pumping shafts. The line is being gradually drained, but as no stune has been struck in the shaft 200 feet deep, the intention is to drive east until stone shall be cut so as to effect a drainage and consequently an assessment.

The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The extended claim system, whereby each company of alluvial miners is entitled to hold 1 00 yards square of ground, in deep sinking, or where any very great outlay is required, I think will work well, and will, most probably, give a great impetus to the alluvial mining at Huntly, where such ground is mostly found. For several months there have not been more favorable indications, relative to mining gene rally, particularly in the north and south portions of the division. The Amherst rush (the commencement of which took place im mediately adjoining the southern boundary) has extended northerly into this division, and though nothing of moment can be yet reported nevertheless from the steady progress which the miners have been making in this direction, it is evident several fresh valuable discoveries No new leads have been discovered, although the miners at the head of the lead are expending large sums in prospecting. In the other portions of the division little or nothing is being done. Some persons are still anxious to put up pud dling mills in such places where gold is likely to be found, but most of these are on ground still closed by former applications for lease not yet withdrawn. If these were thrown open they would, I believe, be soon turned to ac count. will follow, not only in the numerous flats but also in the low ranges, in many of which a number of promising reefs have already beea discovered. In quartz mining nothing of great importance is now going on. The reefs continue to yield the average amount of gold, which certainly does not diminish in quantity as the depth in creases. The greater portion, however, of the reefs, that is those yielding at present only sufficient of the precious metal to clear expenses, are still prevented from being worked exten sively, by water, and such will be the case until some effectual drainage law compels the co operation of every claim holder who is or may be benefited by an adjacent pumping engine. Gibraltar \u2014 Is again rushed and presents a very lively appearance. The sinking is shallow, as yet, varying from five to fourteen feet, but getting deeper as it approaches the supposed run between the old workings of Gibraltar Hill and McCullum's Creek old lead \u2014 a blank now very likely to be filled up. The average yield is not less than 10 dwt- to the load. Three tubs of wash-dirt taken from the bottom of one little shaft on Saturday last turned out 5 ozs. of coarse gold, and the wash-dirt out of eight others bottomed the same day paid from 3 to 5 dwts. per tub. Havelock Flat. \u2014 This portion of the division is at present the scene of a rush which promises to become important. Its position is about a quarter of a mile N E of the Carisbrook aud llunolly road, and near its junction with the Maryborough road, as represented on plan of the workings in this section of the division, which will be forwarded by the next mail. The sinking on the new lead promises to be less than 1 00 feet, as shown by vertical section of prospector's shift, near the supposed junc- tion of the Maryborough and Havelock old leads, a combination of which seems to have formed the new one. The prospects already obtained (in some instances 6 ozs. to the bucket), are sufficient to justify the belief of a MARYBOROUGH MINING DISTRICT. Maryborough Division. (D. OLeary, Mining Surveyor.)

Of the three crushing engines represented and recently erected, the first and smallest, Hosking's, has only four stampers and Chilian mill, 8 horse-power. The second, Watkin's, works eight stampers, 10 horse-power ; and the third belonging to Perseverance Company, of 20 horse-power, drives eight stampers, which will ultimately be increased to twelve. Amherst Division. (Charles Cole, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Approximate value of all mining plant, \u00a319,300. I have the honor to report that, from the copious supply of water throughout the divi sion (which is generally the case at this season of the year), mining matters wear a very favorable aspect. Some fresh discoveries in alluvial and quartz mining have taken place during the month. Gold, in payable quantities, has been dis covered in two gullies leading into the Amherst Flat, and connecting with the lead which has been recently discovered thereon, and known as the Reservoir Rush. The excitement created by this rush is fast declining, and with it a decrease in the population takes place. At one time there were over 3000 miners on the ground, but as the lead proved to be very narrow it was quite evident there was not sufficient auriferous ground for such a number, and a large proportion of those who rushed hastily to the ground have since left. The population at present is about 1500, who arc sanguine of finding lucrative employment for some time, more especially as the gullies in the neighbor hood are proving auriferous.

(William Byrne, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 On Rocky Flat Frontage Lead the majority of the claims are yielding good dividends. Nos. 14 and 15 bottomed their shaft recently and obtained therefrom over 1 oz. of gold ; at present they are engaged in opening out their main drives, which require to be well timbered, as the strata near the bed rock is of a very loose sandy nature. Nos 12 and 13 are pro gressing rather slowly ; they are working with a horse whim which is found inadequate to their requirements, as they have a large body of water to contend with ; they state they will be obliged to erect steam machinery. On the new line of frontage claims, men tioned in last report, several shafts have reached the water and find it so heavy that no progress tan be made without steam machinery, and to allow them time to obtain such a few of the claims are registered. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The ground in the vicinity of Mount Gree.nock is attracting the attention of the miners. The company in possession of the five acre lease lately obtained a good prospect and are now engaged in sinking a new shaft which they expect to go considerably deeper than their first one. From the appearance of the sinking in their present shaft, which has attained the depth of 75 feet, there is every indication of a good lead existing; they have an 18 horse-power engine on the ground ready for erection. Twenty-four miners have applied to have the groimd declared under the frontage system; a larger number than this is not necessary under the bye-laws. Quartz Mining \u2014 A new reef has been discovered close to the surface about one mile In accordance with the instructions enclosed with your communication of the 15th May instant, informing me of my appointment to the office of mining surveyor of this division of the Maryborough Mining District, I have the honor to append a correct statement of the number of miners engaged and the amount of machinery employed. There are at present at work 10 quartz reefs, the prospecting claims on which have been registered and in which payable gold has been struck. to the south-west of the Amherst rush, the thickness of which is from 8 to 10 feet ; a trial crushing yielded 6 dwt. per ton A little to the south of Blacksmith's Gully a new reef has been found, 2 tons crushed yielded 1 1 oz. 12 dwt. ; at present the lode is 18 inches in thickness A prospecting claim has been granted on a new reef discovered near the surface convenient to Mount Glasgow, a trial crushing of 1 ton yielded 1 oz. 1 6 dwt., thick ness 20 inches. From the Staffordshire, Mia Mia, Sydenham, Carnubian, and New Year Reefs, there is nothing worthy of note to report. Herewith is forwarded a plan of the Am herst rush, with the necessary connection. The number of claims taken up and entered under the head of prospecting claims, but which have not as yet obtained payable gold, is 34. The want of crushing machinery in the Red Bank and Mountain Creek portions of the dis trict has heretofore been much felt, owing to there being no proper means available of pro perly testing the value of the stone raised ; I may state, however, that the machines now being erected by Messrs. Nettleton and Com pany at Mountain Creek, and Messrs. Simp son and Company at Red Bank, are expected to be in full working order in the course of three weeks at furthest. Iccupal tiun.

Five pro specting claims have been granted in alluvial ground, viz. : one at Murphy's Flat, one at Inkermann, two at Sandy Creek, and one at Burnt Creek, all in shallow ground ; and a population of from 60 to 100 miners are at each of these places. The stone raised from the Pyrenees Reef has hitherto proved to be of a very rich charac ter, the party working the spare ground claim between the prospect claim and No. 1 South, having obtained 124 oz. 17 dwt. 12grs. of gold from 75 lbs. weight of quartz, no returns of the yield from the other reefs have as yet been furnished. In alluvial mining there is nothing of any consequence to report since my appointment. A considerable number of men have returned to the old ground in the neighborhood of Dunolly, Burnt Creek, Wattle Flat, Inkermann, and Cochrane's, and many are erecting puddl ing machines ; sites for thirteen of these have been granted during the month. A small rush in the direction of New Year's Flat, and about 12 miles east of Navarre, has taken place, but has not turned out so well as anticipated, the depth of sinking averaging about 25 feet and the yield reported to pay fair wages, but no heavy finds have been discovered. At Cochrane's a steam engine has been erected and has commenced work in crushing cement with which the made hills, in that locality abound. I may mention that since the rushes to Murphy's Flat, Navarre and Amherst, the popu \u25a0 lation here appears to have become much more settled, and owing to the richness of the quartz reefs already opened up, I can see little reason to doubt but that the diggings will be of a per manent character. The Chinese are chiefly located at Burnt Creek, they have much increased in number during the month, and I consider that increase an indication of their success in mining ; the ground in which they are working is very wet, but their great number enables them to over come that obstacle. Dunolly Division. In quartz mining there is little change to report ; the various auriferous reefs in the division are being worked in their usual manner, Poverty Reef keeping the lead, its prospects brightening as it deepens. Three mining leases have been surveyed duriug this month, viz.: one of 5 acres of alluvial ground at Burnt Creek; one of 5 acres on Queen's Reef, Moliagul, and one of 4 acres on Specimen Hill, Sandy Creek.

Korong Division. (John S. Robertson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 \u25a0 The Deep Lead, Old Inglewood, has still a great number of men at work, a great many holes have bottomed on gold (between sixty and seventy); although the average yield is not so good as reported last month, the majority of the claims are yielding from lj to 2 oz. to the load. The claims ahead show signs of very soon striking water, one claim indeed has already struck it at 142 feet. Over 1,200 men are shepherding on this rash. Although the lead is widening considerably it is by no means increasing either in richness or depth of wash-dirt. Total number of persons of all classes re siding within the Korong Division, 16,300. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Frontage Lead, New Inglewood. \u2014 The Engine claims have bottomed their shaft at 130 feet, on soft pipeclay, having gone through a layer of cement ; about four feet from the bottom they opened out a drive 25 feet, when they crossed a gutter 15 feet wide with a very great quantity of water. The prospect they obtained from this gutter was only J oz. to the load, an amount not at all remunerative, and in consequence many of the claims on this lead have suspended operations. The owners of the Engine claim, however, are now driving on in the hopes of getting a different run of gold. The alluvial diggings at Old Kingower and Glenalbyn have not been so prosperous as they were last month, although several nuggets have been obtained ; this is owing I presume to the thinness of the population, as most of the miners from these places are now working at the Deep Lead, Old Inglewood. The discovery of good gold in a claim at Scrubby Gully, mentioned in my last, has been confined to the claim, as no traces of a lead outside the prospectors' boundaries has yet heen found. At Korong the alluvial mining has improved, as several payable claims have been bottomed. At the Pick and Shovel Flat several nuggets have been obtained, the largest being nearly seven pounds weight. The number of quartz reefs proved to be auriferous, 130. The area of ground actually worked on, in cluding alluvial and quartz, 27 square miles. Aggregate value of mining plant in this division, \u00a332,000 Number of notices I have received for pros pecting quartz reefs, 26 ; ditto for alluvial sinking, 7.

The mining popidation remains about the same as it did last month, the slight increase in the number of alluvial miners is, in a great measure, owing to some of the quartz miners A discovery and application for a prospecting claim was made to me, in a gully situate about 14 miles north of Wedderburne Township, which was expected to turn out very well; but the expectations of the prospectors have not been realized, and there are at present only about 30 miners at work, very few of whom are making wages. A great many of our puddling machines have been enabled to work this month on ac count of the seasonable supply of water, and in most instances doing pretty well. The quartz reefs, Inglewood, still retain the satisfactory position they assumed last month. Occupation. Europeans. Chinese. Jluvial miners 4,000 80 [uartz miners 3,000 7,000 80 Description.

In one instance. on Buchanan's Reef, a very good lode of stone was struck a considerable depth below the water level, viz., 240 feet: this is supposed to be the main reef, which, if upon development it proves to be, will be a most important feature in quartz mining in this division. The machinery is as follows : The celebrated Columbian Reef, in No 1 North, have struck another lode more to the eastward of the last, and which, if lasting, gives promise of exceeding in richness their former extraordinary productions The average yield of the quartz crushed during the month has proved highly satisfac tory ; although in some cases (but very few) the yield has hardly been remunerative. Value included in the above, In Old Kingower, quartz mining is progress ing but slowly, and the report last month of the Hope Reef having struck stone of extraor dinary richness has, upon investigation, proved to be a fallacy. Price of crushing, by stamps, from 15s. to \u00a3\\; by mill, \u00a31 10s. The population in this division has greatly decreased in consequence of several rushes to Dunolly, Navarre, &c , having lately occurred. At Mclntyre's the claimholders I spoke of in my last on Marshall's Reef are still persevering in their attempt to discern the lost run of the gold, which, some time ago, was found on the surface in such extraordinary quantities, but abandoned in consequence of the original finders being unable, after considerable labor, to trace its course. In the immediate neighborhood of St. Arnaud the population has slightly increased, as it always does towards the winter \u2014 many miners knowing the alluvial ground in this vicinity returning from other fields, there being ground near and around St Arnaud which would pay better for working than almost that of the best of the late rashes, provided the supply of water were sufficient. The quartz reefs in Jericho are still proving remunerative, and have rather advanced since my last report. The great width of the reefs in this place enables the shareholders to work comparatively poor quartz to advantage. The different reefs yielding an average of 1 and 2 oz., and sometimes as much as 2J oz. per ton. Generally in this division but little in the alluvial is doing except at Hines. and there it is only the number of miners which make it appear so, as the average of the dirt washed from lj dwts. to 7 dwts , after deducting only the actual expenditure, ieaves scarcely a sub sistence to those working. In quartz mining the state of things has im proved, many new and promising reefs being opened, whi'st many others are being diligently prospected or eagerly sought. This class of mining has for a considerable time been the only support of this district, scarcely any but puddlers turning their attention to the alluvial. In the immediate neighborhood of St. Arnaud only three alluvial gullies have been worked, and in each instance proved highly auriferous. From St. Arnaud there is a radius of seven miles of splendid looking country, and almost wholly untried, scarcely any of the (apparently) fine auriferous looking gullies being tried at all ; some of these sweep for miles the bases of quartz and schist ranges, and in which any practical miner or geologist would reasonably suppose an auriferous deposit existed ; but The reefs at Jordan's remain in the same state as mentioned in my last, viz., little or nothing doing on them.

On the Chrysolite Hill, Messrs. Edgar and party have completed all their works, and the engine is I believe to be set in motion to day, so that this reef (the Ballaarat) providing the company are not deceived in the capability of their engine, &c, will at last have a fair trial. The reefs at Hines are looking very much better than they have yet done, and I have not the slightest doubt that with the continuation of the same perseverance on the part of the shareholders in those already found they will yet be sou d to improve. CASTLEMATNE MINING DISTRICT. Castlemaine Division. (Thomas Lawrence Brown, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Most of those now prospecting for reefs have either advisedly or by conviction adopted my advice as contained in a former report, that I thought their attention should be turned to the low and gently sloping points of the ranges, as they dip into the flats, rather than to the summits of the tremendous high ranges, where they bad sought hitherto. I have visited several just commenced to be prospected, some bearing every indication of being auriferous and payable ; those commenced some time back such as the Cambrian and Liverpool have greatly improved in appearance. On the Cambrian the great drawback is the heavy body of water, but the prospects obtained are sufficiently good to guarantee the erection of machinery on the reef. From the stone I saw I think the inducement is sufficient. The machinery is as follows*: \u2014 On the Liverpool Beef where they have long continued prospecting with but a poor prospect, I am glad to report they have at last struck quartz apparently highly remunerative aud about 3 feet thick. Directly behind or to the north of Hines' station and within his paddock, a reef about 12 feet thick is being tried, as yet but little gold has been seen ; but from the quality of the stone and its general appearance, I think it will eventually prove payable. At St. Arnaud, the Bristol Reef or supposed continuation thereof has lately produced some splendid stone, supposed by those who have the claim to yield 8 or 10 oz. per ton. I have not yet been down the shaft but I am credibly informed, that at the depth of 70 feet they have driven 3 feet into the reef and have not yet obtained any signs of being through it.

Among others, I may record \u2014 withstanding which, however, Coffee and Hall (2) have obtained 115 oz. 4| dwt. during the month. , Campbell and Company (4) have obtained, during the month, 309 oz, 14 dwt. Mussett and Company, (4) from 139 tons, including 40 tons of refuse, 135J oz. None other of the workers on the reef have as yet struck the main lead of gold. The Cumberland Reef Company have de cided to wind up their affairs. Like many other companies, they commenced with too small a capital, basing their calculations upon the erection of faultless machinery, certain, uninterrupted, successful mining operations, and immediate returns ; but their ruin has been their machinery ; the works have been suspended during the month, and will t emain so until disposed of The Argus Hill Reef (formerly applied for on lease by Mr. J. B. Were, of Melbourne). The southern portion, worked by tunnel by Faiibiirne and others, produces splendid gold, the whole body us quartz being excavated for crushing. In the adj ining claim, worked from the crown of hill, a vein is being worked which yields 1 oz. 13J dwt. per ton, and speci mens above half an ounce each. On the Mou a Reef, where formerly much labor was fruitlessly expended sinking on the eastern side of an immensely thick capping and reef, and which has been repeatedly aban doned as non-productive, Stewart and Company have been occupied lately in quarrying quartz for the railway, and have discovered an aurifer ous vein to the east of original workings, which is yielding 2 oz. 4} dwt. per ton. leaving us to suppose that considerable gold has been carted away as ballast for the railway line. It is to be hoped the purchasers will be more fortunate in their operations as the reef is throughout proved payably auriferous ; the adjoining claimholders. Hutton and Company, having worked their claim profitably for years, and are still realizing a constant supply of payable stone. The Fortuna Gold Mining Company's ma chinery, of a light useful character, started on the 25th April ; up to the 14th May, 100 tons of mullock crushed yielded about 29 oz. of gold, since then they have been improving, as on the following week they realized 29 oz. and last week 42 oz. of gold ; their wages amount ing only to \u00a330 per week, leaves a wide mar gin for profits. On the Meredith Reef the persevering pros pectors. Bowden and Company, were en couraged by their last crushing returning them 1 oz. 13 dwt. per ton. A new reef has been opened to the east of the Nuggety and is named the Switzerland beef, \u2014 a prospect yielding 4 J dwt. per ton., with every indication of improvement. The Ph\u0153nix Quartz Mining Company (late Eureka) have been cleaning up their machinery and are sinking their pumping and working shafts preparatory to extensive, and doubtless, if properly managed, successful operations ; their very superior plant and an immense body of moderately payable quartz should produce favorable results to the present proprietors. A prospect ton obtained from a continuation of the Nuggety gave 1 oz. 4 dwt., and another new reef called the Chapel Hill Reef, yielded 7| dwt. from two tons. The Bolivia Reef Tribute Working Company have, at length, discovered payable stone. The week before last a crushing of 20 tons yielded 46 oz. 18 dwt, and last week they informed me their stone was improving, with every pro bability of continuing so, as the lode, so far as yet proved, is payable throughout ; their depth is 155 feet Other claims on the Bolivia are also paying well. Two shares in No. 7 have been sold for \u00a3120 ; the depth of work ing in this claim is 185 feet, and the yield a little over one ounce per ton. A late trial of stone from No. 6 claim obtained from a depth of 200 feet, gave 15 dwt. per ton. The private claimholders on the Eureka are still progressing. Harris and Company, since erecting their engine on the reef, have enabled adjoining claims to extract payable stone from below the water level. The Wattle Gully Company, in order to avert the forfeiture of their lease, have let portions of the ground on tribute, and at the present time sixteen tributers and two wages men are engaged upon the leasehold, these will be increased if the miners find the terms ad vantageous, although it can only prolong the gradual demise of the company. The Specimen Gully Gold Mining Company was the first formed in this district and con sequently had to pioneer its way. Their powerful machinery was erected about two years ago, yet only 3,795\u00a3 tons have been The Whitehorse or Reservoir Reef maintains its position as the best at present working in this district.

Cost of production not ascertained. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 A good prospect has been obtained from their deepest workings ; 20 tons realizing 38\u00a3 oz. and a second of 25 tons, of 16 oz. 11 dwt. but from imperfect arrangement and difficulty of working, a miner can only raise 1 \u00a3 ton per week. Above the water level there is an immense quantity of quartz, but generally it does not pay for excavation. Great difficulties have always existed with their machinery, the cumbersome stamping and pumping apparatus which is of the old Cornish heavy timbered description, has ever been under repair. To the \u00a310,000 spent originally, \u00a35.000 proceeds of gold must be added, and unless money can be raised and a very different system of supervision and management in troduced, this once lauded company will be come defunct. The Nuggety Company, of which I have previously had to report favorably, is still improving ; as they descend below the water level, their stone increases in value, and in addition to the rich lode formerly reported, other veins are being cut in which the precious metal glistens very conspicuously. Two engines have removed to other districts, The peculiar sameness of this division leaves little room for any lengthened report that would be of interest to the public ; however the miners generally, and especially those engaged in alluvial mining, are in as prosperous a state as in any part of the country. The plans I have the honor to forward this month comprise 3^ square miles, including Kampf's, Humbug. Scott's, Tucker, Victoria, Dead Horse, New Chum, Specimen, Little Specimen, White. Little Poverty. Crow's, W il son's, Groat's, Bolivia, Cumberland and Poverty Gullies (the latter of which is above two miles in length) also. Little Bendigo, the White and Red liills, White Hill and Campbell's Flats, and also includes the Cumberland and Bolivia leases, the reefs, water-rights, machinery and all granted claims, which are shown with the connections, bearings and distances. The puddling interest is in a very thriving condition, especially in the older gullies. On Windlass Flat a party of puddlers have netted \u00a325 per man per week, during the past n.onth. In Spring Gully, Angwin and party have been making \u00a39 per week each man. These are. instances that have come under my notice. In all directions however the puddlers seem to be working very contentedly. Tunnelling generally, is in a prosperous state. On Table Hill, Harle and Company, Beatty and Company, and Biekham and Com pany are making splendid returns ; and others are doing well. Day and Company who are driving a new tunnel into the hill, have struck the drift, and it produces lj oz. to the load. There are eight shareholders in the party, and \u00a3100 per share has been already offered, but not accepted. Fryer's Creek Division. (R. L. M. Kitto, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 In connexion with the claim of Day and Company, there is rather a curious case pending, with respect to the title to the claim. Bye-law 36 of the Castlemaine Mining Hoard, provides for working ground on the frontage system, and is worded thus : \u2014 \" Hills, where the sinking shall exceed forty feet in depth, and principally through rock or cement, shall be considered Description.

Discovery of Iron Ore \u2014 I have much plea sure in reporting the discovery of iron ore in the vicinity of Pickpocket. In the case of Day and Company, as in many others, who work their ground by tunnels, the ground gets shallow towards the brow and sides of the hills into which their tunnels are driven. As however the bye-law distinctly states that, \"all parties shall run their tunnels within their own parallels,\" it is impossible to embrace the position occupied by the tunnel, except by extending the parallels to the river frontage, and over the shallow ground. Hitherto all the attention of the country has been directed to gold mining, and very little interest taken in the mining of the baser metals. Undoubtedly, however, the day is not far distant when other branches of mining will receive a fair share of attention to the benefit of the colony. This shallow ground is in many cases aurif erous, and the question has arisen in the case of Day and Company, as to whether they can hold the shallow ground within their parallels ; they not having struck payable gold in the deep ground sufficiently long to test it, in accordance with the mining bye-laws, vjhich allow a month's trial of the ground, the average of which is to be taken to decide the payable capabilities of their claim or otherwise. Taradale Division. (Thomas Turner, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The case is one of some considerable im portance here, and has excited not a little in terest amongst the tunnelling community. Alluvial mining in the vicinity of Pickpocket is in rather a languid state. The Perseverance Company are busily at work, and are making fair returns; their wash dirt averages 7 dwt. to the load, which is con sidered remunerative. Their engine, only a 8 horse-power, is sufficiently large for the purposes of draining and winding. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 McLeod's party are making fair returns. Carmichael and Company, although they have a 16 horse-power steam engine in po sition, with one of Hart's washing appara tus, all complete, are doing but little, in con sequence, it is stated, of the company not having funds to properly open up the ground. Baker's Company (late Windlass Hill Com pany) are doing well. Mr. Baker showed me 10 oz. of gold, the result of one day's work. In quartz mining things are very dull, in fact the whole quartz mining interest is in a state of langour Scarcely any of the private claimholders are doing anything worthy of notice. The El Dorado Company promise fair to become remunerative at last ; they are vigor ously at work, and their yields gradually im proving. The Ferron's Reef Company are still idle, as also is the Emeu Company. Approximate value of mining plant in this division, \u00a37,000. The Vaughan Company is still in a pros perous state, and declare regular dividends.

River two claims have been taken up on that once abandoned reef, known as the Coliban Reef; there has been no crashing of stone as yet, but both parties seem sanguine of great success, and by reason that quartz can be crashed now-a-days at a much less cost than when this reef was worked before, and in fact every expense is now at a lower rate. on private properties. Although the sinking is on high ground, the auriferous drift is found not deeper than 20 feet, and is often much nearer the surface, but is upwards of 100 feet higher in level than the bed of the Back Creek, which is in close proximity. A few miners are also engaged on the old worked grounds within the precincts of the township ; and for a mile southward of it, along the valley of the Back Creek. The working on Jefferson's Keef has been stopped by reason that it did not pay ex penses. Alluvial workings are prosecuted, but to a very small extent in any part of this Taradale subdivision. The Star Company.\u2014 A designation lately given to Messrs. Gateskell and Company's as sociation, who hold 10 acres of alluvial ground on lease. They lost the run of auriferous drift about six weeks ago. but have since excavated the tunnel 55 feet further under the hill in a NN.E. direction, and are still persevering on wards, besides having cut branch drives both to the right and left of the tunnel. The entire length of their tunnel is 485 feet Although the earth is dry yet a great part of the tunnel has to be supported by slabs and props on account of large flakes of earth slipping off in many places ; the bottom or substratum (which is sandstone with seams of shale all lying on edge) has an inclination dipping under the hill at an angle of about five degrees. The Liberty Flat Gold Mining Company have now 30 men employed, and have stripped nearly half an acre of the bottom, from which they have taken, since the 1st of March. 66 oz. 4 dwt. of gold. This yield is no adequate return for their expenses yet having 10 acres of ground leased to them, there is great probability that some of it will prove richer than that which they have hitherto wrought. The tunnelling party at the Sccrpion Hill, about three weeks ago hit upon the lost lead which was worked there some four years ago. They have washed out, on an average, 1 oz. from the load, through a horse puddling machine. Another party who are working the old ground adjoining, are also doing satis factorily, they also having a horse puddling machine. Another party of two miners are sinking a shaft higher up the hill than where the Star Company's tunnel has yet reached, and at a much higher level find a deal of water. The Thistle Company (which is an asso ciation of sixteen miners who have taken the Cobban Company's works, situate on private property two miles south of Taradale) are working energetically, but without any great results ; they are getting a little gold, and are prospecting further with the expectation of hitting the lost lead of the Ironstone Hill. Victoria Gold Field. \u2014 Very little is doing here in alluvial ground. A horse machine is puddling some surfacing at the mouth of Vic toria Gully, the returns from which have been very poor. With respect to the reefs they produce many changes. Several claims have lately been re gistered for protection whilst temporally re linquished for want of funds, whilst others have been entirely abandoned. Only one claim is being worked on the Victoria Reef, that is the prospector's claim, and but one on the Ashtonia. one on l\\ew Year's Reef, and one on the Prince of Wales's \u2014 which sums up only four claims now being worked on ground where, three months ago, twenty claims were held. The puddlers in Charcoal Burners' Gully have not met with any adequate returns for their labor and money expended. Neither have the party been successful who have been, and are i-till searching for Mudd's Reef, which is suppo-ed to exist at this place, and where, in September last, Mr. Mudd obtained 2 oz. 7 dwt. of gold from two tons of quartz found on the surface. Humboldt Reef.\u2014 There are but two claims being worked on this reef, and the prospectors are the only party getting gold. They have not had any crushings of late, but have 50 tons of good looking stone about to be carted to the crushing mill. The lode in their claim has increased in thickness as they descended, and is now 2 feet thick at a depth of 90 feet ; it was only 10 inches on the surface, it has a slight inclination to the westward in its descent. I am fully impressed with the conviction that want of capital alone retards the de velopment of these auriferous lodes ; their auriferous character is very apparent, but not being sufficiently rich where struck, to pay immediately the expenses incurred, they are soon abandoned. Two shafts are being sunk on that new reef called the Argyle, which discovery I mentioned in my last report, and which is situate further north than any of those mentioned above, but no crushings have yet taken place. Malmsbury Gold Field. \u2014 At the Coliban"], [201, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS MAY. 185 There has been some new discovery made in quartz ground in this field nearer the town ship, but the position of the reef not having been fully explored the application for the privilege usually awarded to discoverers in such cases has not yet been put in at the warden's office. improvement has taken place during the last month in alluvial digging, about 200 men are employed at present at the new rush on Nuggety Flat, the greater part earning fair average wages. A rush has also occurred about three-quarters of a mile nearly west of the township of Bradford, the depth of sinking is from 7 to 1 5 feet to a bottom of decomposed granite, the wash-dirt being of from 2 to 18 inches in thickness and averaging 2 dwt. to the tub. A general opinion is entertained that this rush will prove lasting, as the features of the country present excellent gold-bearing indications ; it appears to be the outlet to the westward of the Porcupine and Nuggety Flats. 202 1 tons of quartz which were crushed lately at Mr. Holy well's yielded 144 oz. 9 dwt. of gold. The quartz came from No. 1 claim on Ashtonia Reef. Barfold Ranges. \u2014 There has been quite a revival of mining affairs in this quarter, about twenty miners being now at that gold field and eight or more claims are being worked. A crushing machine is in course of erection on private ground in Snodgrass Gully, at a spot about half a mile westward from Steed's mine, which is the nearest worked ground. On the west bank of the Loddon, ground is being eagerly app ied for to be taken up in large blocks or associated mining claims. Several attempts have been made to bottom this ground but without success owing to the water ; it will now be worked by machinery. Maldon Division, (Robert Nankivell, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 From four to five hundred miners are engaged higher up the river in mining on private property, some of whom are doing very well. At Pickpocket matters are very quiet just now, two companies have started with steam machinery, one on private property, and hopes are entertained that it will prove remunerative when the ground is opened up. The borse puddling machines on Porcupine Flat are doing very well, but the yields from the company's steam puddling machine has been very indifferent. The Maldon Gold Washing Company in Long Gully are employ ing 30 men; of these companies the wages have not averaged \u00a32 per week each man. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Quartz mining has also improved during the past month ; the machines of three companies, viz. : Parkins's. Cookman's and Concord, are ready for work as soon as water is available, the quartz now being raised from Parkins's and Cookman's Reefs gives every indication of good yields. The Perseverance Company at Wattle Gully will start again shortly ; the Company has been registered under Pyke's Act and the share holders have agreed to make a farther pay ment of five shil ings per share for the purpose of again testing the mine. The South Linscot's Association promises well, but the monthly returns cannot be ascer tained before this report reaches you. The North Linscot's Company, on the same reef, will be ready for crushing operations in about another month, quartz in the mean time is being taken from the mine in readiness for crushing.

The returns from the Union Company on Eaglehawk Reef, are nil, consequent upon their machinery undergoing an alteration. The process of amalgamation as adopted by them, viz. : ripples with copper plates being found not to answer, they had some quartz crushed at the mills of the \u00a3outh Lincot's Company, the yield from which more than doubled that of their own. this trial has decided them upon adopting the same process as that of the above company, viz. : Chilian wheels and revolving basins. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Eaglehawk Company has, since my last, crashed 888 tons of quartz, the yield from which was 233 oz. of fine gold, averaging a little over 5 dwt per ton, the ground is being vigorously opened up for the purpose of work ing the mine more extensively. The yields of the Beehive Company have greatly improved, during the past month 533 tons have been crashed, producing 486 oz. of fine gold The ground of this company is of a very patchy nature, the lode at the bottom of the mine looks well at present. In quartz mining no material change has occurred during the last month, most of the old established claims yie'ding satisfactory returns, and no new discoveries have come to my knowledge. Lately more than usual atten tion has been bestowed on the quartz reefs cropping out on the surface on most main ridges in the western portion of Jim Crow, and the prospects in general in that locality are very promising, although, as yet, no definite results have been arrived at. Irish Billy's Reef, Sandy Creek, has been taken up again, and the stuff crushed has yielded about 13 dwt. per ton. One party on this reef has about 60 tons ready for crushing, which is expected to yield about an ounce to the ton. Payable gold has also been struck on Victor Emanuel's Reef, Green Gully, and also on an abandoned reef, newly named Salop Reef. between Muckleford and the township of Maldon. On Melvin's Reef, head of Blind Creek, the yield, generally just barely remunerative, has during the last month so alarmingly decreased that the holders are thinking of suspending operations for a time at least. Although the auriferous character of the reef has now been known for nearly two years, and a crushing machine has for upwards of six or seven months been on the ground in full operation, still the reef has only been worked to a depth of some 14 or 16 feet, and there is not therefore, in my opinion, any reason to despair of the reef ultimately proving a very valuable one. Nuggety Reef still keeps its old reputation, out of six claims working on this reef, four are doing well ; the average yield from said claims is fromj.3 to 4 oz of gold per ton, taking the whole of reef which is from four to six feet wide, at a depth of 240 feet. Hepburn Division. On the Wombat Reef, Wombat Hill, matters are as usually satisfactorily progressing, the Cornish party netting a handsome dividend, and the other parties, Clarke and Company, and Granfield and Company, busy prospecting for a continuation of the lode. (Ambrose Johnson, Mining Surveyor.) 1 he population is as follows: Collier's Reef, on the same hill, is again getting into favor. Several claims lately have been taken up, with a view of erecting ma chinery if any at all encouraging prospects are met with On the same line of reef a couple of hundred yards more northerly than the oripinal workings.

This claim has been remarkably steady in yield, the quartz now being raised being expected to average over 30 oz. per ton. The claim on St. George's Reef, held by the Cornish party, has been temporarily registered by the company while making arrangements for procuring efficient machinery. In Yandoit no marked improvement in quartz mining has taken place, most of the claims registered for some time are again gra dually being taken up and operalions resumed, but I have heard of no new discoveries of im portance. A rumor lately got abroad and was commonly believed, that an extraordinary rich reef had been discovered, the exact locality of which, however, remained a secret, and the report has not as yet been authenticated. Several parties, however, assert having seen the specimen, and the report may therefore perhaps be not altogether unfounded. On Hoggett's Reef, head of Blind Creek, all the claims have now got water so heavy as to make steam machinery necessaiy, and oper ations have therefore been suspended, all the claimholdcrs appearing inclined to amalgamate their claims and enlarge the company. On Old German Reef, the Goldsmith Com pany is busy opening up their ground and raising quartz, and crashing will be commenced as soon as the company's dam has received a sufficient supply of water. The company has purchased Messrs. Hutton and Company's claim, from which crushings have yielded from 5 to 9 oz per ton. and it may therefore be anticipated that when the company gets fairly to work the result will be above an average. On Trogish's Reef the prospecting claim still shows very well, a couple of ounces to the ton being the average, but nothing of any de finite character has as yet been struck in the other claims, although some of the shafts are down a considerable depth. From Glamorganshire Reef I have heard of no crushing since 35 ton- from claim No. 2 yielded 905 oz ; but stone is now being raised that, if rumour speaks truth will outshine any thing yet produced in Yandoit. I have not myself visited the claim, but by report, although such is probably exaggerated, upwards of 1,000 oz. per ton is expected. The prospecting claim is also showing splendid, but the gold dips very sudden, south, and I anticipate that the southern claims will have to go very deep, almost too deep for individual enterpiise, al though the prospect is such as to warrant almost any expectation, On Gibson's Reef, Scotchman's Gully, no prospects have as yet been attained but in the discoverers' claim, and this being situate in the alluvial workings, portions of the reef crossing a dam, the water begins proving a serious obstacle to the opening out under ground of the workings. Only a small portion of quartz has as yet been raised, but the show is very good, and I have a very high opinion of the reef in question. The company holding Boot's Reef, at Boot's Gully, has lately been re-organized for the pur pose of procuring the aid of machinery on the ground, cartage from the reef amounting to 25s. and upwards per ton, and even at that rate difficulties are met with in procuring carts when wet weather has made the roads heavier than usual. Gold seems, however, to be pretty generally distributed through the whole width of the reef some 5 or 6 feet, and I therefore believe that with good machinery on the ground Boot's Reef will prove no bad speculation. From Adams's New Reef, near Old Tom Gully. I have heard of no crushing during the last month, but in the prospecting claim and claim No 2 South the stone is looking as good as usual; and in No. 3 South I learn that quartz has been struck promising to surpass both others in richness. On Adams's and Emeu Reef matters remain at a stand still pending the arrival of ma chinery, negotiations for which I understand have for some time been concluded. On New Nuggety Reef, Connell's Gully. the affairs of the proprietors of the prospecting claim are as usually in a very prosperous condition, but the other claims have not as yet proved so successful, or are altogether abandoned. On the Welcome Reef. Messrs. Villard and Company are sinking a new shaft on their lease, and the lease block of Messrs. Doney and Company has been disposed of to a new com pany, who have not as yet began active opera tions on the reef, being engaged refitting and improving the machinery. The Perseverance Company, in the bed of Sailor's Creek, has by the setting in of the wet season been compelled to suspend operations and are now engaged crushing the quartz raised during the last summer. On the Beehive Reef, Dry Diggings, Messrs. Thomas and Company's claim is still turning On the Hamburgh Reef, the prospecting claim and No. 2 South, the only claims where gold has been got. and both of which have been unusually rich (fourth shares having fetched \u00a31.000 to \u00a31.400), are both well nigh worked out above water, and have therefore temporarily suspended operations, pending the procuring and erecting of machinery. Both"], [204, "188 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS MAY. north and south of these claims shafts have been sunk to a depth of upwards of 150 feet without striking the reef, but the prospecting is still being vigorously prosecuted. complaints, still, on the other hand, no marked improvement has made itself felt as yet; in fact puddling has almost uninterrupted been pur sued through almost the whole dry season. A considerable number of puddlers from Bendigo and Forest Creek have lately settled in Jim Crow, and seem to be very well satisfied with the general aspect of affairs in this locality. Puddling machines are gradually being erected in the outlying western gullies, Shicers, Sulky, and Champagne and surrounding gul lies, and from the prospects in most instances obtained, I anticipate that these gullies will be extensively worked this winter. The more ex tensive races have only just began to be sup plied, so I have nothing of importance to report in this branch of mining, most parties having hardly completed their preparatory arrange ments, but I believe I may safely say the prospects look as promising as ever. On Pioneer Reef, the Pioneer Company's boiler his arrived and machineiy will at once be erected, pending which most of the adjoining claims held by individual miners have been registered The erection of the machinery will undoubtedly confer a great benefit upon most of the claimholders on the reef, as most of the claims are down 100 feet and upwards. having a great volume of water to contend with, and in claims No. 3 and 5 South, where the reef has been struck, the quartz has not averaged above \u00a3 oz. per ton barely payable where extra difficulties are to overcome. The Great Reef Companv's machine is kept busy employed, partly crashing for hire, but I have not learned the result of last month's crushing. Tunnelling. \u2014 In this branch of mining the usual activity prevails, and the results are as usual every way satisfactory and encouraging. The greater portion of the old ground in Italian Hill, Wombat Creek, is occupied and in full work, and. as far as I can learn, on an average paying good wages. The same may be said of the elevated plains and other basaltic hills on the Spr ng and Sailors' Creeks, and from thence downwards along Jim Crow Creek through Franklinford towards Yandoit fresh tunnels are going in at short intervals. On Canadian Reef a number of claims have again been taken up, but so recently that the parties have not yet completed the preparatory works. On Malcolm's Reef, in private property, I und rstand that the principal proprietors have made an arrangement with the lessees of the Cader Idris lease, outside the property, and into which the reef by reason of its underlie is ex pected to enter, at a depth of about 1 60 feet pur porting to work the reef conjointly, water having been struck in Malcolm's paddock, and the remaining portion of the reef not being con sidered of sufficient extent to erect an engine for. The lead appears to cross the Jim Crow Creek at the southern end of Mr. Morrison's property, making for the Yandoit plains, and from one end to another, both in Crown and alienated lands, throughout the whole distance, shafts and tunnels are briskly progressing. On New German Reef, Mes=rs. Cuthberth and Company have completed their crushing machinery and commenced crushing, but the company can hardly be said to have come fairly to work, and the result of their crushing can therefore not be taken as a fair test of the value of the claim The adjoining claim south. No. 2. has struck the reef, but owing to some difficulties among the shareholders work has not lately been carried on with that spirit that else would have been the case. In the Green Hills, on Yandoit Creek, several claims have lately been taken up, the Man chester Company being daily expected to break into the gutter. It was some years ago ascertained by a tunnel into the Yandoit Hill that deep ground exists through the Green Hills, but the tunnel was about 50 feet too shallow, and although a monkey shaft in the end of the tunnel bottomed in the gutter and obtained a prospect, still the Yandoit Creek did not admit of a tun nel being put in at a sufficient low level to drain the gutter and work to advantage, and hence the ground was deserted. The Man chester Company has now sunk a shaft in the back reef and are driving towards the gutter, intending if necessary to erect an engine on the ground, and guided by the tunnel just mentioned, they may be expected shortly to break through. Two extended claims have been taken up by strong companies, and the reef is now in a fair way of being thoroughly tested. Besides these, a number of claims are being prospected all over Yandoit, gold having been got in most, but in insufficient quantities to pay, at least I have heard of nothing calling for especial remark during the last month. Puddling and Sluicing \u2014 The late rains have enabled puddlers and sluicers in most instances to resume active operations ; but very little new ground has been taken up this season, and al though generally speaking, no reason exists for In alluvial sinking the principal feature is the progress of the township's lead in Dayles ford, the lead having, as far as hitherto traced, proved itself of more than usual richness, \u00a310 per week per man being a minimum yield ia"], [205, "MINING SURVEYORS REPORTS MAY. 189 several of the claims for the last couple of months. The leads appear to be making for the police reserve now occupied by McGill and Company, and several shafts have this last week been started in private property in that direction. St. Andrew's Division. (James Murphy, Mining Surveyor. The population is as follows : \u2014 The prospecting party in Blanket Flat have not as yet been successful ; their shaft has now attained a depth of upwards of 1 70 feet without bottoming, but the drift water has this last week been so heavy that eighteen men in three shifts have been continually baling without the influx in the slightest degree abating, and the party do not expect to be able to bottom with out the assistance of an engine. The most part of the flat in the vicinity has een marked off and taken up; but, as usual in such circum stances, the ground is merely shepherded until the prospectors shall have proved the exist ence, direction, and all other particulars of a lead. Payable gold has been got in shallow ground leading into the flat, and the existence of deep ground being thus demonstrated, and judging by appearances, the existence of a per manent lead can, in my opinion, hardly be doubted. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 In the rest of the old gullies tub and cradle are gradually giving way for puddling ma chines, and those few parties working on the old system, although nuggets and good patches are now and again turned up, do not, in my opinion, make much more than a living. I have heard of one nugget being found in old ground in Don't-make-'em gully, but have not received any reliable information as to the size In King William's Gully, Yandoit, the Young Extended Company have shifted their engine, and seem to be getting well paid for their labor. Since the last month sever.il claims from two to twenty acres have been taken up, both above and below the Young Extended, all of them intended to be worked by machinery. Approximate value of machinery and mining plant, \u00a38,200. This division, with its numerous quartz reefs and unworked creeks and gul'ies, so long over looked by the miners of Victoria, seems at last to attract their attention ; as is clearly indicated by the increased number of miners shown in the foregoing table : in fact, it is the largest number of miners I have had to report since my appointment as mining surveyor, and I anticipate a still further increase during the month of June. The Grand Junction Company has at length began showing signs of activity ; an engine has arrived, and is being put up with all possible speed, and the shaft will probably soon be pro ceeded with. In the Alpha Company the difficulty between the monied and the working shareholders has been amicably settled, a new company having been formed and purchased twenty-eight fortieth shares at \u00a350 each, and the claim now is in full work. The cause of this improvement, during the month of May, is to a great extent owing to the more extensive working of the gold field discovered through the very creditable exer tions of Mr. Moore and party in February last, and reported by me at that time. An other portion of this gold field has been opened during the past month, and I have no hesitation in saying, that in no alluvial work ings in Victoria can gold be had upon terms so easy as here. The Victoria Company have got a fine face of 5 or 6 feet of wash-dirt in their cutting, but they do not expect anything of c msequence for some 25 or 30 feet yet. The Pickpocket Company is also favorably progressing, having stripped a large paddock of wash-dirt, and all the companies in that locality will shortly, I trust, add considerably to the weekly gold produce.

One dish full of stuff, which included both surface soil and drift, and t.iken at random, yielded about 10 grains of gold; and the owners >>f this claim washed out 8 oz. of gold, with their tin dishes, in one day. The average yield of their sluicing is one pound weight of gold per day between four men. The unworked aurife ous flats along the banks of the Back Creek, of which there are many between Queenstown and Haley's Sta tion, are being prospected and in one case with success, as I have seen about 3 dwt of gold washed out of two tubs of stuff taken off the bottom of a prospecting shaft The sink ing is through about 1 5 feet of sandy loam to the washing stuff, which is 3 feet deep making in all 18 feet from the surface to the rock. This ground is admirably snited for sluicing, as there is an ample supply of water all the year, and the washing stuff is of a loose sandy nature, and of such a depth (3 feet) as will enable those employed to obtain a good return for their labor, even at a much smaller yield per tub. than that obtained in prospecting this ground In quartz mining very little has been done during the past month in this division, as many of the quartz miners left their claims unworked while they went to try the Eltham rash and the Mountain Diggings. This was to some extent owing to the temporary stop page of the quartz mill at Salter's rush ; and because a report bad gone abroad that it would not be worked any more. This mill is, I am happy to say, now at work, after having un dergone very considerable repairs, and very great improvements; and the yield of gold from quartz treated there now is in most cases more than double what it was heretofore, al though the quartz in every case seemed inferior in point of richness to any crushed from the same claims before those improvements were made. The result of this is that some of the miners have resumed the working of their claims, and hence the slight increase in the number of quartz miners during the month of May, and which I have no doubt will be still further increased during the present month. Further down in this creek, the d pth in creases to about 3 feet, with about the same amount of gold, distributed through the soil and drift, as there is in the shallow ground ; which, of course, involves a little more labor for the same amount of gold Nevertheless, men with a very small amount of skill as miners say they can earn good wages, and are well satisfied with what they get in return for their labor. From the large amount of quartz in the drift of the creeks and gullies of this locality, it is highly probable that ere long some very large quartz veins will be discovered, which will greatly add to its importance as a gold field This gold field, formerly known as \" Moore's Rush,\" is now called the \" Mountain Diggings ;\" it is distant from Melbourne about 37 miles, and the route is through Eltham and the Kan garoo Ground to Queenstown, to which latter place there is a conveyance three times a week Beyond Queenstown there is no conveyance, in consequence of the difficult nature \"of the country \u2014 so difficult, indeed, that all the re quired stores and provisions have to be carried on pack horses ; and I doubt if a convenient dray track can be found or established in this direction, unless at a very great expense. Another toute may be had by turning off by the One-tree Hill road, within a mile and a half of Queenstown ; thence through Smythe's \u2022 iully or \"Kingstown,\" and over Mount Misery An excellent cart road can be es tabished by this route for a sum of about \u00a3150 expended in cutting sidelings in two very steep peaks, which are the only serious obstructions on the whole line. I blazed this track on Monday hist, and it has since been cleared sufficiently to allow a dray to pass, but for the obstructions I mention. The amount of quartz crushed during the month of May was 195 tons; the average yield of gold was about 2J oz per ton. 'she price of crushing is \u00a3 1 at Salter's rush, and at Queenstowu the very extravagant price of \u00a31 14s per ton is still charged. At Anderson's Creek nothing of any im portance in mining matters has occurred during the past month The operatons of the Yarra Yarra Mining Company have been stopped, whether finally or not I am not pre pared to state. The gold field recently opened near Eltham, and mentioned in my last report, promises to be both of importance aud utility, from the auriferous character of the surrounding country, and from the energy with which extensive prospecting is being carried on in the creeks and gubies in the vicinity of the aboriginal reserve, and a'ong the Yarra Yarra I have been informed of some new discoveries within the last few days, and shall visit them as soon AU the machineiy at Anderson's Creek is now idle, except one horse puddling machine and a crushing machine worked by horse power.

Unfortunately, in all quartz crash ing transactions, whether loss of gold occurs from inefficient machinery, ignorance of ma nipulators, charlatanism, or any other cause likely to occur at quartz mills, the miner, and the miner alone, must bear it without the slightest chance of redress ; and hence so many abandoned quartz reefs.

Nos. 7, 8, and 9 Claims North (amalga mated), have been worked with a whim to a depth of 143 feet, the water being too heavy the works are suspended, and the ground under registration. Nos. 10, 11, 12, and 13 Claims North (amal gamated), have sunk a shaft to a depth of 130 feet, at which point the reef with a large quan tity of water was struck, the works are sus pended and the ground registered. There is another reef being prospected on the ranges near Campbell's The party is nnw burning a trial kiln. They have seen some good gold in the stone, and of a kind similar to the Campbell's Reef. The Southern Cross Company, Nos. 1 4, 1 5, 16, and 17 North (amalgamated;, have sunk a shaft with the aid of a windlass to a depth of 120 feet, and struck a good reef 2 feet thick, which yields 2 oz per ton, but the water proving too heavy they are erecting a whim to work out the stone above water level, after which it will require steam-power to be of any service. The yield of gold from the Londonderry cement continues to be as good as at the date of my last report. Parties continue to obtain prospecting claims for the discovery of lost leads. The claimholders of No. 18 and No. 19 North. are taking out top-stone, until it is proved whether the Campbell's Reef Quartz Mining Company's engine will drain the ground. The various tunnel companies continue to pay reasonable returns. I have been shown some very good speci mens of quartz obtained from a shaft near the reservoir in Opposum Gully; the party is san guine of success. The Campbell's Reef Pioneer Quartz Mining Company's engine of 25 horse-power (nominal) with winding and pumping gear, is at full work. The engine shaft is already sunk 125 feet, and a conti act made for sinking 25 feet further, to be completed in four weeks from this date; this shaft being situated on flat gi\\,und will be 110 feet below the water level.

The claims on the north end of the cross reef are almost at a stand still, water being the great hindrance ; this will be remedied to a certain extent on the completion of Messrs. Grant. Lamont and Company's pumping machinery, which is now in course of erection. The claims at the south end of the reef are looking well, and the returns very handsome. \u00bb In No. 27, stone was got out at 50 feet from the surface, which yielded 4 oz per ton. This ground would undoubtedly pay well, with the assistance of steam machinery.

The Allandale party have not yet reached the gutter, but expect to do so shortly. as they have found the dip of the reef on the north side of their shaft, the contrary direction to which they had previously been driving I may mention that the Royal Oak and Chinese whim claims are still yielding very handsome dividends; the latter, which is on the junction of the Raglan and Argyle Lcad~, is supposed to be the richest claim in the district, whilst the Raglan and Marco Polo Company's claims are barely remunerative at present. McCooke's Lead is tenanted solely by the prospectors; their shaft is 60 feet deep,' their The European population engaged in allu vial mining has not in anywise increased during the month, nor have there been any finds of a character to cause much excitement since my last report. A piece of gold, weighing 12 oz., has, however, been unearthed near the Waterloo Hill, and the finding a still larger piece (of \u00a370 value) near Jonathan's Gully, has caused the deep ground in that neighbor hood to be nearly all taken up in claims.

The next party, the Champion of the Seas Company, are erecting a steam engine. The Reservior Company, whose shaft is situate within the high-water level of the reservior, have sunk to a depth of about 80 feet from the surface, and will probably bottom on or near the gutter. The Cockatoo Company have obtained a prospect at a depth of 87 feet, and will probably be the first party (south of the prospectors') to reach the lead. The Shamrock and 'I histle have just erected a steam engine, as they found they could not bottom their shaft by manual labor.

The new bye-law for the division gives a much more liberal area than that heretofore allowed in wet sinking, and will, no doubt, tend to increase the number of alluvial miners in the division. Within the last few days, a small rush has occurred near the Old Charlton Lead. The prospectors obtained 6 oz. of gold from two loads of wash-dirt.

I forward plans and sections of the Town ship Company's quartz crushing machinery. This machinery, which is fitted on the self feeding principle, has been found to act very well. There has been as much as 230 tons of quartz crushed by it in a week. No. 3 Division.

Nothing further has been proved with respect to the lead discovered by the United Cosmopolitan and Red Jacket Com pany. Owing to the few changes which have taken place within my district during the present month I have nothing of any interest to report. The steady character of the operations car ried on renders it uninteresting, though, at the same time, they are, on that account, very favorable to the men engaged in w-ork.

(Michael O'Malley, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 On this subject, however, I have nothing new to report, beyond the fact that several in ventions have lately been brought before the public, none of which, as far as I am aware, have received a thorough trial. The interest in the question, though less than formerly, cannot be said to have died out, but it must be confessed that the faith in new inventions is remarkably small. It is only fair to add that very few new amalgamators have had a fair trial. Experiments have been made on a small scale with imperfect machines, but the inventors have seldom had the means of making a series of trials. This seems to be the case both with Porter's and Quillam's methods; for though some small experiments were made at first. the inventors have not been able to show any of sufficient magnitude to enable the public to pronounce an opinion on the merits of their inventions. Not one half of the inventions (the plans of which are to be found in the patent office) can be said to have been tried at all, and certamly, as far as I have seen, the miners themselves are not disposed to risk the loss of much time or money in making trials. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 This latter fact leads to another which is very often overlooked, namely, that by the careful working of known methods nearly all the gold may be saved. It is true that some companies lose much gold, and some even, perhaps, more than they save ; but it does not follow that, by the u<e of proper care and skill, very nearly all the gold cannot be saved. The trials made by one or two companies have shown that very little gold is lost, and I doubt not that greater experience will enable the miners to employ the appliances now in use even more effectually. Since my last report nothing of particular interest has occurred in the division, nor has there been any new ground opened, yet, upon the whole, I believe the general state of mining affairs is about as healthy and prosperous as usual. In seeking for new inventions there has been a tendency to neglect proper precautions, and it cannot be too strongly pointed out, that the utmost care is required in order to render the known methods thoroughly effective. Deep Leads. \u2014 Frenchman's and White Horse. \u2014 The Defiance Company (late Cumberland, Durham, and Cornish) mentioned in my last as driving in search of a new lead, expected to run into the old Frenchman's from S. E. direc tion a little ahead of their old parallels, have recently discovered the object of their search by boring upwards, and so far, I am informed, obtained encouraging prospects, having brought down a few specks of gold through the bore. They have not however, as yet, broken into the gutter but expect to do so in the course of a few more days. The Red Jacket Company are still prospect ing for what they expect will turn out a distinct lead from Frenchman's, as they have some reason, even still, to believe that the ground I have thought it right to mention this, as I have seen m ire than one compaay fail for the want of some few ordinary precautions. It may be admitted that the present methods are not perfect, but they are capable of being made more effective tban at present if proper attention is given to the details of the opera tions carried out. In conclusion, I have only to report that during the last month mining operations in my district have remained unchanged. Occupation. Europeans. Chinese.

A few more weeks however will set the matter at rest and, so far at all events terminate the suit presently pend ing in the Court of Mines between themselves and the Nelson Company in reference to the ground in question. Both companies are \" tenants in common\" for that portion of the Frenchman's Lead where the supposed new lead is expected to join or run into it. but as the discovery (if discovery it be) has been made exclusively by the Red Jacket Company, they claim an exclusive right thereto, and only admit the right of the Nelson Company to share the old Frenchman's gutter with them. Besides this dispute another has lately sprung up between these companies which I fear is likely to be of a very expensive and protracted nature, and which has also found its way into the Court of Mines Apart however, from these matters the claim of the Nelson Company is likely to be very rich and to remunerate the company for some five years of hard dead labor spent in sinking, as well as for some \u00a39000 or \u00a310,000 actually expended in the purchase of plant, machinery, and other mining materials. The company are presently preparing pud dling gear, and puddling up their shaft after bottoming a few days since at a d.-pth of about 374 feet from the surface, and expect to be getting up wash-dirt in a week or two ; but as they have not yet thoroughly tested the stuff on which they bottomed I cannot give any very reliable account of its yield more than to say that from the small quantity washed, the company appear highly pleased with the result. Company have not yet completed the erection of their new engine but expect to have done so within the month. Shares are also looking up in this company, the present price is up wards of \u00a3400. Prospect or Crawfish Lead \u2014 The Alston and Weardale Company are busily engaged in putting in their main level \u2014 at a depth of 345 feet \u2014 for the gutter which they expect to reach about three months hence. The two other claims taken up on this lead in April last are still held in reserve pending a dispute which is about coming before the Court of Mines in a day or two in regard to part of the ground which is claimed by the Scottish and Cornish Company (Black Lead) as being within their parallels. This latter company after ineffectually batt- ling with their watery foe for some two years have at length decided upon getting more powerful machinery which I understand is on its way from town and will be put in position with all dispatch. They are to have a double column of 12 inch pumps which it is expected will be amply sufficient to bale any water that may be encountered. The large frontage claim (6151) recently taken up by Messrs. Fussell, Crowther and Co (87 shareholders) to the south of the Scottish and Cornish Com- pany's claim and extending as far as the parallels of the Leviathan Company, Napoleon Lead has been just started, and a shaft com- menced on the southern portion of it, where in all probability the depth of sinking will be about 450 feet, and where an immense quantity of water may be expected, which the company, as I am informed, are preparing to effectually contend with by sending to England for an 80 horse-power engine with all requisite plant and gear to correspond. Whim Holes, Little Hard Hills, &c\u2014 Mat- ters about this locality are at present very dull, as all the known auriferous ground has been repeatedly turned over, and the miners do not appear to have either the ability or inclination to venture upon prospecting. Two or three companies, however, continue to realize very good wages at the Little Hard Hills by crush- ing cement ; and a few other parties are doing pretty well by puddling some of the old ground ; but generally, I am sorry to say, the district presents a veiy cheerless aspect. On the Staffordshire Eeef mining matters continue much the same as at the date of my last report. The Mentor Company crushed during the month 177 tons of quartz from a vein averaging 7 feet in width, taken from 150 and 170 feet levels, which yielded 8 dwt 11 gr. per ton. No. 14 South had also crushed at this company's mill during the month 1 65 tons of stone from a 120 feet level, which gave an average of 6 dwt. 5 gr. per ton. This latter company purpose getting up machinery of then own at an early date, so well pleased are The Working Miners Company are not yet through the rock, but expect to get through in a fortnight. Their present depth is 370 feet and though within two or three feet of the bottom the rock continues as hard as ever, so that powder has very little effect on it. This company are also about to erect puddling gear, which is to consist of two large puddling ma chines well lined (bottom aud sides) with sheet iron; and though not yet into gold a share has been lately sold at \u00a3785, the largest price I believe ever given for a share in any claim before gold was struck therein, but such is the opinion held of this claim that sellers would now almost get any price they might choose to ask, though twelve months since shares were freely offered at \u00a3240.

No 10 South is at a stand still in consequence of the non-arrival of their machinery, the boiler only having as yet arrived. . The Comet Company during the month crushed 205 tons of stone, taken principally from a 110 feet level, which yielded 65 oz. 17 dwt., or about 6 dwt. 10 gr. per ton. The Oriental Company crushed 360 tons during the month, which yielded 53 oz., or about 3 dwt. per ton. This result, though poor, does not seem to dispirit the shareholders, as the prospecting of the reef in various parts is being energetically pursued. A quartz claim for six men has been taken up during the month on Splitter's Hill, north of the Oriental Company's leasehold, in expectation of strik ing the Staffordshire Reef, on the northern side of the gully. The company have just commenced operations, and are rather san guine as to success. On Penrose's Reef, Moonlight, the Great Eastern Company have had some poor crush ings since their last starting, the average per ton for about 170 tons being only 3 dwt. This company have had shaking tables (Porter's patent) recently substituted for the old blankets and ripple boxes, and consider a great saving in the way of fine gold is thereby effected. They have commenced to crush for the pros pectors (Penrose and Company), who have some 300 tons of stone paddocked. The claim taken up some three months since, south of the Great Eastern Company's ground, is still held in reserve, as it appears the company do not feel justified in com mencing operations with such unpromising prospects as those obtained from the late crushing of the Great Eastern Company. Within the last few days there has been a slight rush to Montrose Hill, Bulldog. The workings are quite shallow, only 4 feet deep, and some few are doing well. At Break o'Day Hill some very good finds have been obtained of late, one party (Hall and Company) having got a 6 lb. nugget, a 1 lb. nugget, together with 1 lb. of fine gold, from a load of stuff. There are other instances of good returns, but none equal to the fore going. About fourteen companies are getting gold here. At Kangaroo and Mount Misery matters go on much as usual. The majority are making fair wages by puddling the oft-worked old ground, but none are obtaining anything worthy of special notice. At Pinehgut there is nothing new astir ; the majority of the claims, however, are paying very fair wages, and in one or two instances as high as \u00a35 per man per week is usually obtained. affairs, as, after repeated trials, and considerable expenditure (\u00a33200) they were unable to ob tain remunerative returns. The prospecting party (All England) at Sinclair's Diggings, have got into the gutter, but are prevented from working by reason of not yet being able to procure some pipes and other necessary castings from Balhiarat. The Rory U'Moore Company (Nos. 1 and 2 East) have recently got up a whim and pud dling machine, and are also into the gutter, and in expectation of doing well; but up to the present they have not had a machine washed.

The Telegraph Company have had some good dividends lately, and the gutter I am informed still looks well, the shareholders are very sanguine through this, at the prospect of what may be in store for them. The John Bull Company, Great Britain Company, and Polar Star Company are per severingly at work with but indifferent success. Napoleon Lead. \u2014 The Sons of Freedom Company after having been swamped out for two years, during which period they have had two engines almost constantly at work, have abandoned the present shaft and commenced sinking a new one. The object of this is to avoid the rock through which the water has percolated to such an extent, that all the efforts to drain the ground have hitherto been ren dered ineffectual. to create new shares, in order to raise capital for the purpose of more extensively prospecting their claim. The Jenny Lind, on the Scandinavian Reef, are sinking and working at the deeper levels, with the hope of improving their returns, which have not been remunerative hitherto. On Hiscock's Reef \u2014 The One and All Company are crushing monthly about 800 tons of quartz, from which the shareholders realize from \u00a34 to \u00a36 per week per man. The Imperial Company have been doing somewh.it better during the past month; their last return for eleven days crushing was 110 oz., most of the quartz in this crushing being raised from the 106 feet and 60 feet levels, where the reef is respectively 1 2 feet and 1 0 feet wide. The Standard Company's plant has been purchased by a Ballaarat company, who have resumed work, and it is to be hoped that their claim will now be thoroughly tested ; from its position there is every reason to anticipate that it will ultimately become payable. The Who'd-have-thought-it Quartz Mining Company, on Kitty's Lead, have suspended work for some weeks past. The Hard Hill Cement Company have adver tised their engine and plant for sale. Franklin Company. \u2014 This company have also been sorely troubled with water, not having been able to reach the face through this cause, for the last three months ; and it is feared that some considerable time will elapse ere they will be able to resume work in the drives. Black Lead.\u2014 The Old Black Lead Company have removed their engine and plant to the lower portion of their claim, where they hope to bottom the new shaft in a day or two. The upper part of this ground has been thoroughly wrought out, and has yielded good wages. On the upper portion of the Black Lead, near the Buninyong Cemetery, several parties of Chinese have been at work for some months past. I am informed they have been doing exceedingly well on the Southern Reef ; and in one or two instances have obtained over \u00a320 per week per man. No. 6 Division. (John Lynch, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The South Durham Lead has been taken up again. Four Companies are at present working.

The Washington Company have been more fortunate ; they generally get from \u00a35 to \u00a310 per week. The Lord John Russell and Lord Palmerston are very poor. The Lugar Com pany have not yet bottomed, and the Rip Van Winkle, and Boilings and party, have not got gold yet. These three last named claims are on the Undaunted Lead, which skirts the northern base of the Black Hill. The ground has been sufficiently proved to justify a fresh trial, and from the nature of the present organization I have no doubt but that this experiment will be crowned with complete success I have not learned what progress the Bute Company have made lately, but am inclined to believe that the claim stands in good repute, as shares are quoted higher than before. On the old ground abandoned by the Drilton Castle Company the Chinese have been suc cessfully operating for several months back. The industry and perseverance of these miners are highly meritorious, for the instances are many in which they have succeeded under difficulties of no ordinary kind in turning to useful account ground which Europeans could not manage, even with the aid of machinery, to derive subsistence from. The Smythe's and Browne's Junction Com pany have got very good wash-dirt, but some uncertainty in regard to the proper direction of the gutter has lately retarded their proceedings. The Reliance, Mines Royal, and Red Hill Companies are improving, the former con siderably ; they average during the last month 12 oz. to the machine. On Warren's Flat the Sir H. Barkly have worked out their claim. The Young Pioneer and Hibernia Companies have sold their ma chinery. The ground on which these three last claims stood is not likely to be reworked as the greater portion of it is selected for a market reserve and other purposes by the Municipal Council. There are blocks still left that hereafter might be eagerly sought after. The Old Pioneer Claim has commenced to pay. Until they are fairly into the old gutter they do not expect much ; about \u00a33 per man is the amount they are obtaining at present. The Morning Light and Britannia Companies have worked out the best portions of their claims ; their average weekly returns may be henceforth set down at \u00a33 each man. The Surprise Company have been getting of late from \u00a34 to \u00a35 a week. The Perseverance Company are getting about the same as those last mentioned. Indications ofa new lead into this claim have revealed themselves lately ; it is believed that it is the lost Montrose lead. The Hand-in-Hand and Grand Junction Companies have got nothing yet from their new shafts. The United Browne's Company are now engaged working the remaining portion of the North Briton Lead, and well it sustains its former reputation. On Budgeon's and Browne's Flat there are still many companies at work, some of whom are doing tolerably well. The Success Quartz Company have issued a prospectus for the for mation of a new company, 'ihe British Work man are making about \u00a38 per man. The Hector Company have given up, not being able to find the reef. The Energetic Company, on the Lancashire Reef, are the only party getting paid. On Patterson's Reef matters are still worse ; in deed, up to the present, quartz mining has been in this part of the district anything but a safe speculation. Monkey Gully Lead still prospers. The Falcon Company had, towards the close of the month, \u00a310 per man for one week ; this is a great advance upon the usual receipts for the last eighteen months. The best paying claim in this neighborhood, and probably in the district, is the Red, White, and Blue Prospecting Claim. The secretary is making out an abstract of its yield from the \"beginning up to the present time. I believe it will be found not to fall far short of \u00a32000 per man ; even now, in its decline, it is giving from \u00a38 to \u00a310 per man per week, and has done so for some months back. The Great Western has greatly fallen off of late. The Beaumont gives steadily about \u00a310 per m^in The Cale- donia ground has improved lately ; there is a great quantity of this ground still unworked towards the south end. The Golden Gate is paying well ; they have had 110 oz. for the last fortnight. The Cr\u0153sus have been for some months back putting in a main drive, which they have at length accomplished; they are now beginning to obtain tolerable returns.

The probability is that the right gutter has never been struck in this claim. The Glamorgan have worked out the standard gutter ; they have commenced to test the Black Lead, but if it does not prove remu nerative after a short trial the company will wind up. At Italian's some claims are improving. The Emeu produced 55J oz. for the last week, which gives over \u00a310 per man to each of twenty men. The Redan Company, working nearly two years on the Black Lead, dispute the proba bility of the Black Lead entring the Gla morgan claim at all ; they say it runs east ward of the township on surface Hill and enters Linton Paddock ; and actuated by this belief they have made application to the Go vernment for a mining lease of fifty acres in that direction.

Captain Finn is preparing machinery for his quartz reef Other claims have been taken up there within the month. The Edinburgh Company are doing very well ; they had over 1 60 oz. last week for a few days. The Scotsman Reef Prospecting Company have fitted up a fine crushing battery, but I do not think they have crushed much yet, at least nothing to afford a test of the character of the reef. The Duke of Cornwall have been engaged in erecting cages, tramways, and other arrange ments about their claim ; thev have at length completed everything, and it is expected that they will have a first-rate claim. The Grand Trunk Company have got a steam engine, 35 horse-power, on the ground ; they are beginning to fit it up. The Atlas have got into excellent ground; they have got 19 oz. to the machine several times, and 6 oz. is the lowest ; there is a great height and width of wash-dirt, and in every respect the claim holds out cheering hopes of a speedy reimbursement of the large capital (about \u00a37000) that has been expended on it to the present date. There can be little doubt now but that the Standard Lead traverses this claim The John Bull shaft is not yet bot tomed. A frontage claim for fifty men was taken up ahead of the Grand Trunk last week. The Try Again have also got machinery on the ground. The Cleft of Ihe Rock is now paying, but rather moderately yet. The Grand Junction and Robin Hood are progressing favorably. The British have got nothing yet. The North American is making full amends for twelve months' mishaps. It is at present the best paying claim in the district. 60 oz. to the machine is not an unusual occurrence. The Pioneer, in Linton Paddock, have not as yet found anything of a paying quality. Nothing particular has occurred on the shallow gullies about Linton's during the month At Carngham the United Miners and Gene ral Picton Company have given up. The Menai Straits and Ivanhoe are getting very good stuff; the latter company are placed at a disadvantage for want of water, not having enough for puddling The Cairngorm have passed through the rock ; they are about 220 feet deep, and now into a black sandy drift ; they have sunk nothing during the past week, through some disarrangement < f their pumps. They have applied for another lease of 50 acres adjoining the Cairngorm, and stretching towards the north. The Albion.

(James Stevenson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 All the parties at Graham's Hill continue steadily at work and are averaging good wages ; on the opposite hill, which is a con tinuation of the table land, at the Red Streak, a second party have put in a tunnel, and are averaging from \u00a33 to \u00a35 per man weekly. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 At Bullarook on the Rocky Lead the party next the prospectors have bottomed and ob tained a payable prospect therefrom; on the Tunnel Hill the party adjoining the prospectors afier having put in a tunnel 750 feet, have struck gold, from which they could obtain \u00a3i per man weekly ; with this th.; party are dis satisfied and anticipating better returns, are driving further into the hill. All the sluicing companies are at full work, but as most of these companies only wash up at long intervals, I have no returns to report at present. The Hard Hill Crushing Company have during the month crushed 650 tons of cement and tailings yielding 120 oz 16 dwt. or an average of 3 dwt. 17 jgr per ton, the company estimate the cost of crushing &c. at 9s. 3d. per ton. The Enterprise Company have crushed 1 30 tons tailings yielding 18 oz, and 300 tons of cement yielding 60 oz., being a total of 430 tons yielding 78 oz. or an average of 3 dwt. 15 gr. per ton; this company estimate the cost of raising, crushing., &c. at 7s. 6d. per ton.

It will have about half the crushing power of one of their batteries. Their present crushing power is 82 horses per engine 56 heads. I am sorry to report that the Clark's Point Company have given up work as they could find no surface stuff in their vicinity that would pay for crushing. The Frenchman's Quartz Mining Company have crushed 250 tons of quartz yielding 67 oz. 18 dwt. being an average of 5 dwt. 1 0 gr. per ton ; this company average the cost of crushing alone at 7s. per ton. Clunes Company. \u2014 No deviation in the reefs or the mode of working has taken place. They are stoping down the quartz heretofore opened up. During the past month they have discovered that a fresh encroachment has been made upon their private property, to the extent of 60 feet along Robinson's Reef, by 20 feet high. Although the fact is patent, yet, owing to the present state of the law in such cases, the offence cannot be brought home to the parties who have so acted, as, when the Clunes Company broke through into this drive, no intruder was seen to be there engaged. The new winding engine, 60-horse power, is fixed in its position, and also the boilers. Certain castings are being waited for, when the masonry work (which is of a very superior kind) can be completed in a few days. The winding gear is in course of delivery, and in a few weeks the whole will be finished, except the pit work in the main shaft. At present they employ one 35 horse power winding engine, and one of 16 horse-power. The greatest depth of the mine is 250 feet (For the yield of quartz see the returns of the Fort Phillip Company). On the Opossum Reef the Creswick United Company have sunk a shaft 130 feet deep and opened out a level in driving, which they have cut through a quartz reef 3 feet wide ; the company iutend driving further in order to test fully the ground at this depth, before driving on the lode already cut Clunes Mining. \u2014 In this division of my dis trict I have no special event to record. To refer generally to the position of the mines, I might state that those companies who have well opened their mines are successftdly advancing their works and obtaining paying dividends, whilst those who have opened out their levels too shallow have found it necessary to sink deeper for remunerative quartz. The companies engaged in erecting increased engine power for winding and drainage purposes, are energetically bringing about the completion of same. The Port Phillip Company from the 1st to the 29th June have crushed 2946 tons of quartz, which yielded 1677 oz. 2 dwt. 13 gr.. at an average of 1 1 dwt. 9 gr. per ton. The company are testing the use of steel heads to their stampers and steel bed plates, by placing two heads to one bed plate in three separate batteries, with a view to prove their economy or otherwise over cast iron. A month or two must elapse before the result can be depended upon. They have added some ripple boxes at the foot of the strikes of one of the batteries. to endeavor to retain all the sulphurets as the metal passes from the battery A new and improved shaking table has also been fitted up with the same view. Various other methods to save this metal, which contains a portion of gold, have also been experimented upon ; but the results, though satisfactory in the main, have simply stimulated the company to further diligence to introduce a system to save labor. As soon as the results are conclusive the com pany will make them public. A new self acting turning and screw-cutting lathe, 25 feet long, having 13-inch centres, is fitted up in a new and spacious turning room ; also a new drilling machine. The old lathe is still re tained. These machines can be worked at the same time by a small engine fixed in the apart ment. The steam is supplied from the large boilers. The Yankee Company during the present month (referred to) have crushed 410 tons of quartz ; the total yield of gold has been 51 1 oz., average per ton 1 oz. 5 dwt. The new 40 horse-power mining engine is fitted with dis connecting winding gear, so as to raise quartz from the two shafts sunk upon Robinson's Reef and the Eastern lode. The truck is lowered at present by a break. To work the latter lode the new shaft was sunk 300 feet deep, and a cross cut made to the shaft on Robinson's Reef, which has been lowered to a corresponding depth. Over this shaft new poppet heads will be erected, and the engine be employed to raise the stone from both shafts direct. The engine works well. No special alteration in the Reefs is noticeable. They are driving eastward for the Welcome Reef, which they expect to cut in about a week. Their tramways for the con veyance of quartz to the kiln and battery are much improved. Criterion Company. \u2014 The quantity of quartz crushed during the period already mentioned has been 751 tons, which have given 531 oz. 17 dwt. of gold, showing an aver.ige of 14 dwt. and nearly 4 gr. per ton. They are en gaged in stoping down the quartz opened up on the Robinson's lode, and filling up the wrought out ground by cutting a level into the side of the hill (which, ultimately, will be available as storage room for timber), and con veying the earth removed by a tramway to an The artisans of the company are engaged in making a battery of stamps, intended to be"], [225, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS JUNE. 207 auxiliary shaft to secure the mine, the greatest depth of which is 165 feet. They employ two engines, together 45 horse-power, and 12 heads of stampers. The cost of crushing per ton is 24s. Clunes Alliance Quartz Mining Company are thoroughly repairing the stamping engine (-'5 horse-power) Their new winding engine (40 horse-power) is in fine order, but unem ployed, as they have not had delivered some castings required to complete the pitwork. The pipes are 10 inches in diameter, 15 tons are on the ground, and the remainder is daily looked for. The expenses for the month have been \u00a3362 11s. Id. Clunes United Company have crushed 366 tons of quartz which yielded 184 oz 12 dwt of gold, at per ton 10 dwt 2 gr. The cost of crushing per ton cannot be given at this time ; the depth of the mine is 150 feet. They have been engaged in securing the backs on the Eastern and Robinson's lodes, and arc about to commence sinking deeper immediately. Alluvial Mining on the Southern Hill. \u2014 The Young Sons of Freedom have put in a drive 200 feet towards a block of payable ground discovered in their old shaft. The wash-dirt they are raising is not paying wages They still persevere. Victoria Company have . crushed, from June 8th to 29th, 39 1 tons 1 7 cwt. of quartz : the total yield of gold cannot be stated as a great portion of the amalgam is not retorted ; the yield obtained has been 129 oz. 13 dwt., which has proved to be about half an oz. to the ton. The average cost of crushing is 8s per ton. and the present depth of the mine is 350 feet '1 hey have a 20 horse-power engine at crushing; their winding and pumping en gine is of 40 horse-power. In the No. I level, towards the Yankee Company, they are stoping down some very good stone. On the No. 2 level they have sunk a winze to the water level 40 feet deep and are now stoping from that depth. The reef is here 8 feet wide Another winze is put down from this level at the northern face of the lode, which is here 4 feet thick ; the stone looks to be highly auriferous at this point ; it has not however been separately tested. The reef on the No. 3 level proved to be solid about 7 feet in, when an intersection of slate reef, 18 inches thick. was met with, lying between this said band of quartz and another to the eastward, which proved to be 9 ft. 6 in. in thickness. The latter division of the lode appears to be the richer, and likely to be the main reef; never theless it has not been proved yet, the com pany preferring to work the lode from the western wall. From this point, continuing the cross-cut eastward about 10 feet, they struck another block of quartz \u2014 thickness of which is not proved; this is not supposed to be the Welcome Reef, but simply a spur from it; some time will be required to trace it On this reef, the Eastern, the cost of raising the stone is \u00a345 per fathom, width and height of drive 7 by 7 feet. It is excessively hard. The company employ 53 men, and the expenses for the month have been \u00a3825.

In No 2 Claim they are raising quartz from 140 feet; the reef is 9 feet thick. Alluvial. \u2014 In the West Gully at the upper end (East) a party struck on a narrow ruu of gold bearing towards the Big Hill Reef ; they have washed as much as 2 dwt. to a tin dish : the run is about 4 feet wide and from 4 inches to 12 inches deep, the sinking is from 4 feet to 8 feet deep, the gold is of the same character as that found in the reef. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 About a quarter of a mile down this gully (West) a party have bottomed a shaft at 60 feet and found gold, but not enough as yet to pay. All Nations Gully. \u2014 Potter and party have completed the erection of machinery to puddle the surfacing from the south side of the gully; the engine is 8 horse-power, it is to drive two puddling machines and a cradle ; these are built on piles about 8 feet from the ground ; this elevated position will give them a great advantage in getting clear of the sludge and tailings. One party working in the gully at a depth of 60 feet continue to make about \u00a32 10s per man weekly; the gold lies scattered and patchy occupying above 60 feet in width of the gully. The party who were prospecting in advance of them have abandoned their claim, not being successful in finding gold in their first shaft they bottomed at 75 feet. At this part the gully opens out into a broad flat, and it is pro bable that many shafts will have to be sunk across the course before the continuation of the run of gold be found ; I am of opinion that at this part of the gully the gold will have col lected itself into a more defined run or gutter and consequently narrower.

The Union Company still idle, and for the reasons referred to in my last month's report. The Perseverance Company's operations arc suspended I fear for some time ; they have not been working in their ground, and pending a decision of a general meeting, to be held in Geelong on the 16th July instant (whether the company shall be wound up or otherwise), no operations are being carried on. The winding up of this company will not in the slightest degree affect the faith and belief of those who are interested in deep sinking or mining in a proper and scientific manner, as this fate was predicted some time since by persons well conversant with mining matters. The Iron Bark have had no crushing since my last report ; the vein is a large one. Last crushing yielded 1\u00a3 oz per ton, and judging from the present appearance of the vein will yield equally good The Birmingham Reef Prospect Claim are still working along their lode north ; it seems scarcely settled yet, but the owners ore determined to prospect it for some time yet, as they have perfect confidence in their ultimate success, and from the previous good crushings from 4 to 9 oz. per ton, believe that equally good quartz exists deeper. The Steiglitz Company have not been doing much during this month, owing to certain arrangements to be made with their Melbourne directory. The manager informs me it is the full intention of the company to continue operations vigorously as they have now first rate inducements for going deeper and working on the rich vein they have found (referred to in my last report). The Malakhoff Company are at present idle, owing to litigation at the Ballaarat Court of Mines ; they have divided \u00a33000 from a crush ing the result of four months' labor: they com mence again next week. The quartz from the Wellington Reef is being crushed at the Blackwood machine and is not yet finished. The Gibraltar Company are fast progressing with the erection of their machinery, engine house, laying the pipes for pumping, &c , and their is no doubt that when these works are completed and the water removed from the shaft and drives, that good results will be arrived at, as at their lowest depth, where compelled to adanrion from water, a large and payable vein existed. The Eureka vein still looks well and pro mising, although at its present depth, about 30 feet, it is very small. The Daylight Reef Company have as yet had no crushing, pending the crushing of the Wel lington Reef Company's quartz. The New Year's Reef Prospect Claim have had a first-rate crushing, giving them per man about \u00a320 per week since their last crushing, and it is satisfactory to state that the quartz at the lowest depth in their ground, looks richer than any hitherto obtained. The Redan Claim, New Chum Reef, still crushing the mullock, clay slate, and mica schist, as stated in my last report. There seems at present so be quite a mania for said crushing ; all the mills are fully engaged in it, and in all cases with payable results. From No. 1 South, on the same reef, I saw, a few davs since, some remarkably rich speci mens, and these were found in the deepest ground. The New Chum Company, leased by Messrs. Pyke and Trench, at present idle ; they are fully engaged in crushing the mullock or debris above referred to, and the results are satis factory tp all employing their machinery to crush it. In alluvial mining, the various small gullies lying east and west from any known auriferous reef, are being worked and I believe with pay able results. The diggings on Morrison's Tea-tree Creek, East Mootabool, and Dolly's Creek and Table Laud, are paying well. The deeper the tunnels are made into the Table Land from the river face the richer the wash-dirt. The Morning Star Company have raised a large quantity of quartz fiom their claim, but are now busily engaged in erecting crushing machinery on their ground ; it will be completed and ready for service in about a fortnight. The flit or Miss Company have invited teaders for placing on their ground an engine of 8 or 1 0 horse-power to raise the water to the mouth of their tunnel; and are very sanguine as to their prospects. The Albion Company have been busily engaged in crushing the quartz raised from"], [228, "MINING SURVEYORS' DEPORTS \u2014 JUNE. 210 spirits of the several lease and claim holders. However, as they are looking forward to more prosperous results, they do not relax in their persevering efforts to make up the deficiency of this mouth at a future period, and in many instances the prospects now presenting th. m selves fully justify their anticipations in this respect. It is unfortunate that these de pressing results have been brought about principally by a want of capital, and in some instances skill and experience to open the mines in accordance with a method and scale to enable them to raise the quartz at the cheapest rate and also to have powerful and effective crushing machinery. Wrere this ge nerally the case, Blackwood would present a very different and improved aspect. There are instances here where the mines are pro perly opened and worked, that quartz is raised so cheap that a produce of 3 dwt. to the ton leaves a fair margin of profit although on a small scale. It is moreover contemplated by several engi neers who have lately been on the ground inspecting the workings, &c, to erect machinery to supply the whole of this country with water in sluices, &c. Three races are being constructed from the Moorabool Falls, or thereabouts, to these dig gings, so there must be some material gua rantee in the diggings themselves to induce capitalists to invest money on them as described. A very large claim has been taken up on Morrison's by a party of thirteen men, who intend erecting an engine, &c. ; and a few days since application was made for registration and survey of another large and extended block by a party who already have an engine on their ground. In my opinion the operations of this month in this part of my division, are very promising and satisfactory. In other instances where the needful con comitants of successful mining (capital and skill) are wanting, even a yield of 10 to 12 dwt. of gold to the ton of quartz will scarcely pay expenses, and these unfortunately pre dominate. Blackwood Division. (Thomas Hay, Mining Surveyor.) Simmons Reef. \u2014 The Imperial Company are still engaged in sinking. Their crushings in point of quantity have not come up quite to the previous month's, and the yield somewhat reduced, the average for the last two months being about 12^ dwt of gold to the ton of quartz crushed. Their shaft is now down to the depth of 136 feet. The population is as follows The Lerderderg Company arc still sinking their shaft, but they have lately struck into very promising quartz, which they are now landing and making preparations to crush, and a fair yield, judging from appearances, is anticipated. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Cornish Company from having a copious supply of water have been steadily at work through the month, with about the same resolt as to yield and quantity crushed as the last month, about 80 tons per week, producing about 4 dwt of gold to the ton of quartz. Appleton Brothers have been crushing with some intervals of rest The yield is a little reduced as compared with former months, but still good. The Simmons Reef Quartz Mining Com pany have had a partial stop, but are at work again. The yield of gold for the nvnth has been low. but they say that this has in a great measure been caused by their having crushed a great quantity of rubbish mixed up with the quartz, which they were obliged to land to clear the mine. They seem confident for a better result for the next month. There has been no change in the machinery during the month ; the approximate value therefore is the same as last reported, \u00a322,000.

Hewson's Reef. \u2014 Hewson and Company, since they finished their tunnel, have struck into a fine reef, about 4 feet thick, which looks very promising. The yield from their crushings during the month averages about 8J dwt. of gold to the ton of quartz. Their battery now consists of 8 stampers, and as they are about to make a tramroad from the mine to the mill, their working expenses will be materially re duced, and the profits, of course, increased in like proportion. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Johnson's Reef. \u2014 The Caledonian Company have not been successful in yield this month, not exceeding 2 dwt of gold to the ton of stone. They say that better prospects are in view. It may be a matter of public interest and perhaps benefit, that 1 should mention the fact of a trial made with some iron pyrites, which is found in the quartz of Simmons Reef, in the proportion of about one per cent. One cwt. of this pyrites was tried under the ordinary method of crushing and amalgamation, and the result was \u00a3 oz. of gold from 1 cwt. of pyrites, or an average of 10 oz. to the ton. This result was produced by the ordinary prac tical method, and not by a chemical experi ment, by assay, or otherwise, is the more satis factory, and serves to show what may be gained in carefully saving this mineral, which hitherto has been allowed to escape with the tailings, and carrying with it a great amount of the precious metal, to say nothing of quicksilver. We have had for this month a large fall of rain, in consequence of which sluicing opera tions are being carried on with great vigor all over the district.

In expectation of the erection of the engine at the Two-mile Reef (a 15 horse power one, with sixteen stampers) several parties are out prospecting. At the head of Madman's Gully, on the Weinberg Reef, the prospecting party have sunk 30 feet, and struck the reef, 2 feet thick, and which looks well. Another party have taken up an old reef, pros pected six years ago. The prospecting party on the Two-mile Reef have sunk 70 feet, struck water at 65 feet, and have run a level in at 40 feet 70 feet in length. They find the reef from 2 feet to 8 feet thick.

The Nova Scotia Reef, at Badaginni, four miles from Benalla, also shows well ; a trial crushing of 2J tons gave 3 oz. per ton. A lot of this quartz has previously been used to metal the main Sydney Road. The heavy fall of rain during the month has given a great impetus to all alluvial workings in both divisions. A few parties working in the bed of the creek have been flooded out, but solely owing to their not having taken proper precautions in building substantial dams, and not having sufficient flood races. Most race owners have now an ample supply, and are enabled to work full hours, so that we may look forward to more than average escorts for the remainder of the season. In the Nine-mile Division we have an in crease of two puddling mills, with two more in course of erection. No new ground has been discovered, but the old seems fully to employ all the water that can be got to bear on it. One party, whose water is at a low level, are driving a tunnel upwards of 500 yards long, through a portion of Hurdle Flat, so as to bring their water to bear on the One-mile, a portion of the Beechworth Division. The Ovens Water Company are progressing very favorably, and expect to supply this division in a short time with a large amount of water. At Myrtleford some of the reefs are looking well. Adam's Reef, situated half a mile east of the Racecourse Reef, and lately taken up by Cook and Company, has yielded 18 oz. to nearly 2 tons of quartz. Johnstone's old reef has been taken up lately, and part of which is paying well. In the Yackandandah Division, as regards alluvial mining, a great number of claims have been taken up in entirely new ground \u2014 nine claims on Twist's Creek (vide plan forwarded with June report of 1860), and two extended claims with lengthy tail races on Kinchington's Creek. By this new or rather more used method of long tail races, together with the reduced price of labor, an immense extent of auriferous ground in this division will be found payable, which formerly could not be looked at.

The Berdan's on Polar Star is completely laid aside, at least for the present. The leaseholders on the Comasino Reef are busy erecting their machine, which will be driven by water power obtained from Clear Creek.

The population is as follows : \u2014 The population is very unsettled on account of the Lambing Flat and other new reports of diggings in New South Wales turning out well. It has taken away already several hundreds.

The yield of the quartz reefs in this district, although not so good this month as usual, is still sufficient to give very handsome dividends to the claimholders in most instances; and additional discoveries continue to take place. There have been four prospecting claims registered during June on newly discovered quartz veins ; two of these, the Misery and the Shannon Reefs, are situated at Harrietville, and although at present only small veins show gold well in the surface quartz. The Mount Steward Reef is, on the surface, a large body of quartz, the gold being at present confined to a small vein in front of the reef. It has been discovered on the west side of Morse's Creek, half a mile above the junction with Growler's Creek. Jones's Reef, the fourth new discovery, is situated on the east side of Growler's Creek, a short distance below Richardson's. At the present time this is only a small vein showing, however, sufficient gold in the surface to induce the prospectors to try it. Alluvial mining throughout the division has been much retarded during the past month in consequence of the excessive rainfall which has prevailed since the beginning of June ; consequently most of the sluicing claims in the Buckland River and wet flats have been flooded out, and considerable damage has been done to some claims. Butchart's Reef which I last month reported the discovery of, near the Pioneer Reef, is likely to turn out one of the best in the district; as yet there has been no crushing of any of the best quartz, but a crushing of 16 tons of surface stone, in which but very little gold was visible, yielded 1 0 dwt per ton. At a depth of 30 feet, a very good reef has been struck in the prospector's shaft, 2 feet in width, with gold visible through the whole bulk. This reef runs through the Pioneer Company's Claim, and they are now driving a tunnel at a lower level to work it. The sluicing claims on the higher ground where the hydraulic hoses are used continue to pay very good wages. At Harrietville and on the eastern branch of the Ovens River most of the claims continue payable, but in this locality also the state of the weather has greatly impeded mining operations. The greater part of the alluvial ground on Morse's Creek is now in the hands of the Chinese, with the exception of a short lead, which has been discovered on Growler's Creek near Gander's Reef, and on which six claims are occupied by Europeans. The sinking is on the average 50 feet, and very wet, the yield also being very poor, and not exceeding from 3 to 4 dwt. per load The sinking is through about 8 feet of red loam and the remainder heavy drift formation and sandstone boulders. The Pioneer Reef continues to yield good quartz, but none has been crushed, as the roads are in such a bad state that it has been impos sible to cart it to the milk The Oriental Reef has not yielded so well as usual. Messrs. WTood and Company's claim has not yielded more than 1 oz. 5 dwt. per ton, Messrs. Cotsworth and Company's 2 oz , and Messrs. Thies and Company's (No. 2 south) only 5 dwt. per ton The last mentioned company are now at a depth of nearly 100 feet with their shaft, and have not been able to strike a payable reef. In their claim several promising patches have been struck at different times, and great hopes have been entertained that a payable reef would be found in this claim. At the depth now reached another vein, about 2 feet in thick ness, has divided from the main body of quartz, and dips further to the east ; the best quartz being raised is from this back vein, and the opinion now prevailing is, that this company have not hitherto been working on the right reef. Although at the present time alluvial mining is so dull in this portion of the district, I believe that rich deposits would \"be brought to light, were it not for the great difficulty of working the ground and the greater attractions of quartz mining. The greater part of Morse's Creek has only been worked on what is termed the false bottom, and in one or two instances in which this formation has been penetrated gold '-us been discovered ; the great flow of water, Description.

The prospectors have not yet succeeded in striking the second reef. Faulkner's Reef (Ovens River) continues to yield payable quartz. Although the crushing this month has not yielded so well as before, the return of 1 oz. 19 dwt. per ton is highly remunerative. The Duke of Northumberland Reef is now registered on account of excessive drainage, the surface water caused by the drainage of the adjacent hills being very heavy. Some good payable stone has been crushed during the month. Brenkmann's Reef continues to yield very good quartz, and a portion of the surface quartz now being removed is likely to surpass any thing yet discovered in the district. Considerable quantities of stone are awaiting a more favorable state of the roads to be carted The Hampton Reef is improving. The vein is now 2 feet in thickness in the prospecting claim, and the company in occupation are driving a tunnel to strike the reef at a con siderable depth. from many of the other reefs, At present, I forbear to give any report of these reefs from which none has been crushed, as it frequently happens that quartz in which an abundance of gold is visible only turns out poor, and other stone in which the gold is very fine turns out better than could be expected. The White Star Prospecting Claim continues to yield good quartz, though only a limited quantity, as the reef is not now more than 12 inches in thickness, and the ground very hard to work. The following is a summary of the crushings of quartz for the month of June : \u2014 On Gander's Reef the prospectors are sink ing a shaft on the reef for the purpose of testing it at a greater depth, the quartz being now much poorer. This reef is now very wet, and a small quantity only has been crushed during the month. The Home Reef is now the most promising on Growler's Creek. In claim No. 1 South, very good quartz is being raised; the reef continues to hold well in depth, with good front and back walls, and is about 2 feet in thickness. The Prospectors and No. 2 South have also a most promising vein, but not so large or well defined as No. 1. Messrs. Rich ardson and Company are raising quartz which I am informed is likely to turn out much better than the last. They have, however, not had any crushed during June, and Messrs Gitchell and Company's mill at this reef his been standing idle all the month. The Reliance Prospecting Claim is now again yielding some more rich stone, but none has yet been crushed. It is being taken from the continuations of the horizontal surface leaders I have before mentioned. In conse quence of this, Nos. 1 North and South are again being actively prospected. The Ebenezer Reef is now abandoned as not payable. On the Hit or Miss Reef a quantity of good payable stone has been crushed, and although it is far from rich, yet from the size of the reef (averaging 4 feet) I believe that it may be considered one of the most important in the district. On the Woolshed Reef, No. 1 North has yielded 57 tons of the best quartz yet raised, Name of Reef and No. of Claim. ;no. of Tons. Yield per Ton. Remarks. Oriental : Prospecting Claim . .

As soon as the weather moderates I will use all possible dilligence to make up for the delay ; and wdl forward plans in continuation of the last, in accordance with the instructions received. There is very little change in my division since my last report; several prospecting claims have been taken up in the out districts in some of which gold has been struck. The alluvial miners have a better chance of doing well for themselves under the new bye laws ; each miner owning puddling mills can mark off one acre for each, pegging out in a day what will employ him for twelve months. The quartz miner is benefited also by the new bye-laws again legalising the old system of paying in under the name of \" temporary amalgamation ;\" it was found to work well before, and gives the poor miner a decided benefit in allowing him to leave his claim unworked for a period by paying his stipulated quota to the next working claim, and after wards registering the same.

The population is as follows : \u2014 Quartz Mining. \u2014 Sheepshead Reef. \u2014 Moon and Company, of the Red, White, and Blue. The result of the final crushing of this company was beyond my expectation, there was a fine cake weighing 882 oz. produced, and exhibited in Mr. Bannerman's window on the 22nd June, 1861; they are still crushing from the same body of stone and if anything it is looking better as it deepens. The Union Company are silently crushing and retorting from the same stone ; their re turns are seldom made public ; it is believed they are excelling in yield Moon and Com pany. Several other claims are crushing, but none have struck upon the same reef so far. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 Bird's Reef. \u2014 West Bendigo Company. This line is very much improving. This company expect at least 200 oz. from their retort as the result of this last week's crushing. Bird's Reef Company are getting the stone a little richer ; it appears to be improving with them in depth; their last crushing was nearly 1 oz. to the ton and a large body of stone. Glasgow Reef. \u2014 Johnston and Company are now raising stone from a reef they have lately laid bare, which is yielding \"6 oz. to the ton. This reef lies very flat. I am of opinion it will not continue deep ; this is on the South Glas gow Reef. Stafford Reef. \u2014 The Advertiser Company have struck upon a good looking spur of por tion of the reef, showing gold very much dis tributed in the stone ; this is near the surface and underlying west. * Some of these are abandoned.

I have the honor to forward for the month of June, a list of all the steam machinery in my division, showing how they are employed, their value, the number of tons of quartz crushed by each machine for the month, and the average yield per ton, with the power of each engine. Best and party are getting very fair stone on the surface, the top part of the reef that turned out so well for them. Other claims have struck the reef but have not found payable gold.

On the All Nations Reef Vogler and Company are raising stone at a depth of 40 feet, estimated to yield 1 oz. per ton, with a thickness of reef from 3 to 4 feet. A prospecting claim on the south end of the Star Reef has been granted, and the pros pectors estimate the stone which they are raising, at a depth of 30 feet, to yield 1J oz. per ton ; reef 1 8 inches thick A rush took place in the early part of the month to the Elizabeth Reef, in consequence of the prospectors crushing a few tons of stone which yielded 4 oz per ton, but it has proved to be only a patch, as the stone raised lately by the prospectors does not look so promising. I am progressing as fast as possible with the survey necessary to conduct the water from the reservoir by means of lines of piping, for the use of mining and domestic purposes. The plans, &c, will be forwarded as early as possible. The water brought in to Rack Creek from McCallum's Creek, by means of a race, has commenced running, and sluicing operations are once more renewed. Five companies are at work sluicing on Ballaarat Hill, and the adjacent shallow workings. It is probable that ere long this number will be considerably increased, as the proprietors of the water in tend to extend their race much further. In expectation of this six companies have taken up claims on the Hard Hills, and are only awaiting a supply of water to commence work. At the Reservoir Rush mining matters are assuming a rather dull appearance. Many of the miners have left for the older workings, where they can make more certain of a liveli hood. Those working on the reserved ground have mostly received back the \u00a32 which they deposited, after complying with the conditions, which require them to properly fill in the stuff and drives before abandoning the claim. The population at present is about 800. Nothing worthy of notice has been done on the Scandinavian Lead this month beyond a few crushings of cement, which averaged 1 oz. per load. On the Rocky Flat Lead the majority of the miners who have shafts bottomed, and in working, may be said to be doing well. Great difficulties are at first to be contended with on this lead in the shape of water, but this once overcome there is almost a certainty of success. The shareholders of three amalgamated claims on the eastern portion of this lead have been persevering by themselves in sinking a shaft for the last two months, and I am happy to say they are now in a fair way of reaping the fruits of their labor. They bottomed their shaft the other day at a depth of 90 feet, and obtained a prospect of over 1 oz. to the load, with 2 feet of wash-dirt. This has created a reaction in favor of this ground, which was abandoned for a length of time, but which is now all reoccupied. and no doubt will receive a thorough trial before being again deserted I stated in my last report that the miners had applied to have the ground in the vicinity of Mount Greenock proclaimed under the Frontage System. This was accordingly done, and claims were laid off on the 8th instant. The reason which induced the miners to take this course was, from the fact of Messrs. Campbell and Company, who possess a lease of five acres there, obtaining a prospect of 2 oz to the load at a depth of 75 feet. A few claims are being sunk day and night, and should pay able gold be struck in any of them an extensive rash is expected to immediately set in. From Avoca Division.

The machinery is as follows: \u2014 During the month a great number of alluvial prospecting claims have been applied for. One on the Amphitheatre Flat, about half a mile below Belfast Point ; the depth of sinking 20 feet, and the prospect stated to be 1 5 dwt. to the tub. One has also been taken up in the same locality about 2J miles from Bird's public house ; the prospect is about 2 oz. to the load. There is but one other that I think it ne cessary to mention, from the fact of its being situate at a considerable distance from any ground that has been recently bottomed ; this claim is between Lamplough and Lexton, and close to the Doctor's Creek. The prospectors entertain a very good opinion of the ground. The depth of sinking is 12 feet, and the gold large and shotty. The population of the division has increased during the month of June, and is distributed as follows . \u2014 With respect to quartz reefs I have nothing new to report since my last, except the dis covery of a very rich leader or vein close to the southern side of the road leading from Avoca to Maryborough, and distant about three miles from Avoca. I have not as yet heard the result of the last crushing, but it was expected that it would yield a very large return. The prospectors on the Pyrenees Reef, Red Bank, have again struck the reef \u2014 very rich \u2014 but owing to the crushing machinery not being yet erected there, it is impossible to form an accurate estimate of the value of this and the other reefs in the neighborhood of Red Bank, Hinds, and Mountain Creek, until such time as the batteries now being erected and finished, are in full working order, as claimholders object to send the stone at least 12 or 14 miles to be crushed, the nearest mill being about that distance from the reefs.

There is no difference in the mining popula tion for this division from last month, although several localities have been considerably thinned the increase in other parts of the division leads me to believe that very few have entirely left the Korong division. The Deep Lead, Old Inglewood, which about two months ago gave promise of turning out a rich alluvial diggings is very much on the wane in the estimation of the miners. The wash-dirt which does not now exceed 6 to 8 inches in depth very seldom reaching a yield of 1 oz. to the load. A great many miners have left this locality during the month, and the lead does not at all look encouraging. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Frontage Lead, New Inglewood.\u2014 The shareholders in the engine claim after having driven as they intended doing in my last report, have met with no success, and in consequence all the claims on the lead have suspended operations, and I believe will eventually aban don their claims. Gold has been found in several of the claims, and I have no doubt the whole of the ground will again be taken up by parties who will put on powerful machinery, the great drawback being the quantity of water.

There are very few miners at Sinnot's, but a prospect was obtained this month which has induced several additional parties to mark out claims. The Quartz Reefs in Inglewood are still looking very encouraging ; the result of the crushings have proved satisfactory, so much so, that thirty-nine parties have applied for protection for ground for the purpose of pros pecting for new reefs. The puddling machines throughout the dis trict are now nearly all in full work, and most of them that are working their own claims are being paid. Buchanan's Reef, which I mentioned in my last as having struck stone at 240 feet, have, after reaching the depth of 255 feet, been obliged to register their claim for the purpose of obtaining machinery to assist them in over coming the water which they have met with in considerable quantities. In Korong the alluvial mining has decidedly improved, a great many nuggets have been got which has materially improved the yield of gold for the last month. Fanner's Gully now numbers over 100 miners, and the other gullies have also in creased their numbers. One party on the Dartmouth Reef have, at a depth of 170 feet, struck upon a lode of very good stone, which fact, coupled with other instances of payable quartz having been found at depths considerably over 100 feet, induces me to believe we are at present only beginning to develope the quartz reefs of this district. Sailor's Flat, about five miles north of Wed derburne, which was expected to have fur nished work for a large number of miners is now almost deserted, there being not more than from twenty to thirty miners working at present. The Woolshed Flat has also proved a failure, the number of miners being reduced from over 300 to between 50 and 60. Kenway's Reef, running apparently through the New Inglewood Reservoir, and about which some little excitement created, has quietly subsided. The Chinese on Korong have done very well last month, having sold a considerable quantity of gold to the storekeepers. Amongst the crushings last month, No. 4 North, on the Columbian Reef, crushed 50 tons which yielded 5 oz. 12 dwt. per ton. No. 3 North, Morning Star Reef, 135 tons yielded gross 302 oz. Kingower has last month maintained its cha racter for producing nuggets, four of which I have seen weigh respectively 90, 56, 54. and 60 oz , besides a great many more that have been reported to me of a lesser weight. At Korong the quartz reefs are looking ex ceedingly quiet, in many instances not more than one claim being at work on each, and in none more than two, the remainder being re gistered. In Evans's Gully a hole was bottomed at 80 feet, from which a prospect was obtained of 1 oz. to the load, which has induced several parties to commence sinking in this locality, which last month was very nearly abandoned. In Kingower the aspect of the reefs was not encouraging, until towards the end of the month, when the Union Reef Company struck some very rich stone at a depth of 220 feet. This company, having an immense deal of water to contend with, purpose erecting more powerful machinery. In Jordan's two or three parties are sur facing and puddling, and doing very well. In Jericho and Mclntyre's the alluvial dig gings is entirely abandoned. The Garibaldi Alluvial Diggings, situate near Fenton's Station, which were abandoned for some time, are being again worked by some parties who have taken up extended claims, and the result of their operations has been highly satisfactory. Very little pros pecting has been done in this neighborhood, the whole country about this place being al together untried. At Mclntyre's the only quartz miners at work are those endeavoring to recover the lost Marshall's Reef. The reefs at Jericho are still giving a steady remunerative yield. On the line of reefs known as the German Reef, the Adelaide Reef, the lilack Reef, and the Frenchman's Reef (all of which are only a continuation of one and the same reef), se veral parties have taken up claims ; also on Philip's Reef, lying between that and Jordan ; and on Jordan the shareholders of quartz claims are in better spirits, some quartz having been struck in Patterson's Reef which is expected will turn out remunerative. The sinking is from 3 to 8 feet deep, with wash-dirt from 1 foot to 18 inches, and has given the puddlers a yield of 6 dwt to the load, besides occasionally picking out small nnggets."], [242, "224 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 JUNE.

The population has gradually decreased in this division during the past month, principally among the alluvial miners, and owing to rushes having occurred elsewhere. Among the quartz mining population but little alteration has taken place. This class of the mining community seem very desirous of settling for a time. The above tables show an increase in puddling operations, 16 new machines having been erected during the month ; many of the Chinese who formerly held machines in the division, but had abandoned them, having returned to this system of working. The tables on the other hand show a decrease of steam quartz crashing machinery ; two steam engines, one from the Wattle Gully Company, and one from the Eureka Reef, having been removed from the division. Cases of individual success in puddling and ordinary alluvial working continue to reward the persevering miner, very rich deposits being abstracted from ground hitherto reserved as roads and building sites, and often from the sides of old workings, formerly discarded as non-auriferous ; from some, such workings I know of 9 to 10 oz. to the machine to have been obtained. About seven miles from St. Arnaud, on the Korong road, some parties are working on one of the several made hills which abound in this district. Thus far their prospect is sufficiently cheering, and I have no doubt before many days have expired many more will be located there On the Bristol Reef the only occurrence worth recording is the application by a party of Cornishmen for a lease of four acres. At the St. Arnaud United Company the works are nearly completed, and it is expected crushing will be commenced next week. In the several claims and reefs in the dif ferent portions of this division there is nothing new worth recording, especially so far as the yield thereof is concerned.

The population is as follows : \u2014 The Nimrod Reef, Golden Point, which for the past two years has been very dull, has again given proof of its continued richness. This reef has yielded an immense amount of gold from its surface workings, but these being exhausted the reef was partially abandoned ; one party however (Williams and Company) determined to prove the quartz in depth, and having sunk their shaft 150 feet were last week well rewarded for their perseverence, the first ten tons giving 43 oz. of gold, and this week a single ton has yielded the splendid quantity of 167 oz. of gold ; affording another excellent proof of the auriferous character of our reefs in depth, and a great inducement to others to go and do likewise. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The Nuggety Reef is not only continuing successful, but again yielding up its treasures as of yore. North and Company's claim, from which between \u00a33000 and \u00a34000 was obtained in about two months, has returned 139 oz. of gold from four tons ; a second lot of three tons gave 78 oz.; this gold is obtained from a flat leader, say 3 inches thick. The Nuggety Company crushed 300 tons, realizing 1 35\u00a3 oz. of gold, the quantity reduced containing a large proportion of refuse. Roberts and Company on the same reef received nearly 12 oz. from four tons, and Neate and Company 30 oz. from four tons.

I have the honor to report that during the month of June mining generally has shown signs of improvement. All the private companies are doing well, although the price of crushing has been re duced within the last year from \u00a3 1 per ton to 10s. A rush of about 250 miners has taken place at the Hard Hills, near Pickpocket. The prospectors (Ross and mates) have obtained 2 dwt. of gold to the tin dish of stuff; no other party have as yet reached the bottom, but, judging from the number of disputes occurring with respect to the ownership of certain claims. I am led to believe the miners think it a likely looking place. The depth of sinking is about 90 feet, through gravel, ce ment, and a false bottom of pipeclay. I send you a plan showing the relative posi tions of German and Mopoke Gullies. As the workings in both these localities are unimport ant I send you this on a scale of eight chains to one inch The tributaries of Mopoke and Davis Gully, Smith's Gully, Milkman's Gully, Little Mopoke Gully, and Lees Gully. In the vicinity are the Mopoke Reef and Frenchman's Reef. The tributaries of German Gully are Hec tor's Gully, Humble's Gully. Winn's Gully, Marshall's Gully, Irish Gully, Chinese Gully, and Rogi-rs's Gully ; and the Old Pennyweight Hill in the vicinity. The German Reef and Pennyweight Reef are in the vicinity. The latter is evidently a continuation of Mopoke Reef. The number of miners employed are as fol lows: \u2014 At Pickpocket mining is in a very dull state, owing to the great quantity of water to be contended with. Neither of the large com panies have made retains worth mentioning. I believe Carmichael and Company have at last reached payable ground. Guildford is at present the scene of most active operations. The Chinese have purchased the right of mining certain private property on the banks of the River Loddon, and are located there about 1000 in number. They have erected several wooden buildings, which fact augurs well for their good opinion of the ground. I was informed by an intelligent Chinaman that one party of 10 are making \u00a3400 per week. In the older parts of the division the allu vial miners are engaged in puddling and sluicing. In connexion with them there is nothing new to report. Considering the number of quartz reefs in this division, it seems strange that such a small number of quartz miners are engaged. Never, perhaps, since quartz mining was com menced in the district has that branch of mining been so dull as at present. Strong looking quartz reefs abound on every hand, and scores remain untouched. I believe a good rush here would be the means of opening reefs to such an extent as to employ several hundred miners. The machinery is as follows \u2014 Our various public mining companies are nearly all at a stand still. The El Dorado is idle awaiting some repairs to the stamping machinery. The Vaughan Company have been making considerable alterations in their machinery during the past month, and have also erected a new stack (chimney). The whole of the altera tions cost only \u00a360 over the proceeds of the partial working of the mine during the period occupied in the alterations. This is considered very satisfactory. The Windlass Hill Company (now Henry Baker) are working steadily. The proprietor informs me that ninepence worth of gold to the load will leave a considerable profit over In both Mopoke and Gennan Gullies there is room for hundreds of miners with puddling machines; but owing to both those gullies continuing into the Strathloddon estate, there is no outlet for sludge.

(Ambrose Johnson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 With reference to the old discovered reefs I beg to report as follows : \u2014 Melvin's Reef, at the head of Blind Creek, with crushing machinery on the ground, ample supply of fuel and water, and above all with an almost unlimited quantity of quartz easily obtainable, and yielding an average of 6 dwt. per ton, has only been worked to a depth of about 14 feet, and is now for some inexplicable cause at a stand still. Some of the original shareholders however have formed a fresh company, and intend resuming operations ; and indeed the prospects are, in my opinion at least, more than ordinarily promising. On Wombat Reef, Wombat Hill, in Dayles ford township, the Cornish party are still at work, with their usual success ; and in the two next claims north, the sinking of shafts in search of the lode, are busily being proceeded with. In both these claims leaders or spurs containing gold, I believe, have been inter sected, but the quantity of stone is hardly sufficient to mtke the working remunerative. On Collier's Reef Messrs. Sampson and Company are sinking a new shaft, and have, I understand, made the necessary arrangements to secure the aid of machinery if the amount of water should prove too heavy to be overcome by ordinary appliances. On the same line of reef, farther south, a tunnel from Smith's Creek, for a long lime abandoned, has again been taken up, caused by specimens being found among the refuse stuff deposited at the mouth of the tunnel, and the party appears determined to give the ground a fair trial. Adam's and Emeu Reefs are still lying dor mant; the companies have undergone a reor ganization, and will, I believe, soon commence operations. St. George's Reef is at present at a stand for want of baling machinery, but the enter prising party to whom it belongs is not likely to leave it unworked longer than necessary. On Mauritzians Reef*, Messrs. Harris and Company have for a long time been doing pretty well, working a surface leader, but they have been unable to trace the gold to any depth, and are therefore about abandoning the ground. The Perseverance Reef, in the bed of Sailor's Creek, near Tipperary Point, has by overflow of water been rendered unworkable for the season, and the proprietors are now engaged crushing the stone raised during the summer, averaging about 2 oz. per ton. Further down Sailor's Creek, immediately below Bryce's Flat, Messrs. Reynolds and Com pany in sluicing of the surface, uncovered a reef that bids fair to become of some import ance. The quartz hitherto crushed has aver aged about 2 oz. per ton, by a width of 3 feet of quartz, but the distance from crushing ma chinery and the almost impracticable roads, are a serious drawback, and the company, therefore, The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Quartz mining in the Jim Crow portion of the division has not, as regards the old dis covered reefs, undergone any perceptible change ; but about Blanket Flat, Champagne, Black Jack's, and vicinity, the numerous out crops of apparently well-formed reefs, sur rounded by highly auriferous gullies, are beginning to receive their share of the miners' attention, and the general geological formation of the country in every respect indicates the existence of first-rate gold -bearing quartz reefs in that locality. The discovery of a gold bearing reef on the 19th June, at Champagne Gully, where three feet from the surface a capital prospect was obtained, directed the attention of prospectors to the ranges in the immediate neighborhood ; and since then no less than five prospecting claims, on different new reefs, haye been applied for, and I am informed that in all cases more or less favor able prospects have been obtained ; but as I have not yet personally visited these reefs, and the discoveries are of so recent a date, I shall defer expressing an opinion until my next report.

On Parker's Specimen Reef, head of Dry Diggings, the block applied for on lease is still idle, but the adjoining claim north has changed hands ; and a new shaft, expected to go down to a considerable depth, has been started. The new proprietors state that some years ago a distinct reef, containing gold, was struck in a western drive from the old workings, and they are, therefore, sanguine of success. On Heehive Reef, in the same locality, the party has, during the late wet weather, been engaged erecting a whim, and in other prepa ratory works ; but the reef, I am informed, is still continuing remarkably good. On Gibson's Reef, (\"cotchman's Gully, where a leader, showing well, was struck in the pros pecting claim, the water has become so 'heavy that operations have temporarily been sus pended ; but as soon as dry weather sets in the ground will have a fair trial. On Adam's New Reef, head of Old Tom Gully, claim No. 3 South, the last where gold has been struck, is showing as well, if not better than No. 2, from which the last crashing averaged 23 oz per ton. A number of claims are taken up south, and shafts are going down with a right good will. The New Reef opened near Champagne Gully is called Margeraux Reef, and is, as I have already stated, showing very well j but I hope in my next report to be able to state something more definite about the reefs gen erally in that quarter In Yandoit matters remain the same as when I last reported ; those claims where gold has been struck are doing exceedingly well, but their number are limited, and a very great number on which six or eight months' labor has been expended, as yet unsuccessful, are reserved for want of funds, excess of water, or other reasons ; a very frequent one of which is the contributing shareholders neglecting to pay up their calls, thus compelling the working shareholders to look to the surrounding alluvial workings for their existence. On Hoggett's Reef, Blind Creek, the whole of the claims, most of which are situate in low ground, have been compelled by excess of water to suspend operations ; but it is intended to amalgamate all the claims and procure ma chinery. On Old German Reef, the Goldsmith's Com pany. I believe, have got their reservoir sup plied, and have commenced operations, but I have not learnt with what result. of the other claims, however, have as yet ar rived at any favorable result, although some are down a considerable depth. On Glamorganshire Reef the Prospecting Claim and No. 2 North, continue very rhh now and again coming across splendid patches, and the rest of the claims are all busy sinking. On Hamburg Reef the claims between No. 2 South and Glamorganshire Reef are going down, but in the Prospecting Claim and No. 2 South, the reef has been worked down to the water-level, and are, therefore, temporarily at a stand still. Pioneer Reef is nearly in the same predica ment. The Pioneer Company have got their machinery on the ground, and are busy en gaged in its erection ; but with this exception, nearly the whole reef is dormant. A few shafts are still prospecting, but the amount of water greatly retards operations. I have not learned the result of any late crushings from the Great Reef Company's ground, but their batteries are kept, partly for hire, continually employed. On New German Reef the Prospecting Claim, lately purchased for \u00a31000, is not shaping so well as was expected, but the whole of the ground has not yet been opened up, and it is, therefore, impossible to have any decided opinion. Nothing definite has as yet been arrived at in any of the other claims, but the reef is expected shortly to be struck in No. 3 South. On Old Nuggety Reef the prospectors are following down a seam of decomposed slate, of which, during the early part of the discovery, very heavy gold, in one instance a nugget of 13 oz, was obtained. The shaft is now 100 feet deep, and the party have started a drive in a westerly direction to intersect the reef. Besides these, a number of reefs are pros pecting about Yandoit, but, as yet, without any result. Puddling and Sluicing. \u2014 Both these branches of mining are now fairly at work all over the division, but nothing especially worthy of re mark has occurred during the last month. Sluicing appears to be on the decline, but in a great many instances where the surface and more gravelly stuff has been sluiced, the clay, too tough and unfit for sluicing, and therefore left, is found to pay very well for pucdling, and a considerable number of new puddl ng machines have started these last months. Hired labor is not employed to any extent, as com pared with the preceding seasons ; but in most instances the parties are handsomely remu nerated. Average wages are \u00a32 to \u00a32 10s, and race owners generally easily dispose of any water they can spare, at \u00a33 a week per sluice head (day water). Tunnelling has undergone no perceptible change, but appears to be in as much favor v\u00bbith the miners as usual. In Italian or Hard On Trogish's Reef the last crushing from the prospecting claim averaged 5 oz. per ton, but the quartz was obtained from a thin leader, de tached from the main body, the average of which varies from \\ to 2 oz. per ton. None"], [247, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 JUNE. 229 Hill, Wombat Creek, a number of men are at work, mostly in old ground, and the same may be said of Stony Creek Ridge. In the lower or northern part of Elevated Plains the gutter has been worked out in some of the tunnels and some of them have started to go through the back reef for a supposed second gutter. A very good lead is being worked in Mr Meggett's paddock and there is therefore, good reason to believe, as no junction has been dis covered outside, that such lead is a distinct one from the one hitherto worked north of the property. From the tunneL below Shepherd's Flat I have not learnt that the lead has been struck, but in my opinion, these tunnels stand a first-rate chance for the northern continuation of the Elevated Plains Lead, lost chiefly through the broken nature of the country. In Yandoit the whole of Frenchman's Hill has been taken up for tunnelling ; a race has been cut from the Yandoit Creek and most parties are doing pretty well The Grand Junction Company have com pleted the erection of their machinery, and have resumed active operations. The Alpha Company have, after two weeks' trial of a small portion of their ground, during w hich period nothing payable was struck, broke up, and the ground is now again in the original proprietors' possession. The Victoria Company have been swamped out of their workings by the Jim Crow Creek during one of the late floods, breaking into their cutting, and their engine is haid at work pumping. The Pickpocket Company are in full work, and although some of their ground hardly pays current expenses, still the company has a most encouraging piospect, in fact the company is just at present opening up in payable ground. Taradale Division. (Thomas Turner, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Manchester Company have sunk a shaft on Yandoit Hill, and have at a distance of 170 feet from the shaft, broke into a gutter, and obtained a prospect, but they appear to be too shallow to drain the deep part of the gutter. Alluvial sinking does not offer any new features of interest. The lately discovered deep giound at Blanket Flat, created some stir, but the only two shafts gone down have, at a depth of about 170 feet, been compelled to cease working by an amount of water not to be over come by hand-baling ; and one of them having obtained a grant of five acres, is now offering terms to speculators willing to furnish steam machinery. Most of the other claims are there fore merely shepherded until some definite result has been arrived at, although the flat generally stands in high favor. In the surrounding gullies. Sulky, Break-of- Day, Keep it Dark, and Don't Wake'm ' ,ullies, a number of people are working but no heavy finds have come to my knowledge, and without the occasional find of a nugget, a subsistence is generally as much as can be calculated upon. The Township Lead in Daylesford, has not been traced any farther during the last month, but a shaft in Mr. Kirwan's property, is now down over 60 feet, and is therefore generally expee'ed to bottom on the gutter, in which case the Police Reserve will stand a first rate chance for the gutter. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 In Yandoit, the Extended Claim in King William's Gully, have removed their engine and sunk a new shaft, from which a 30-feet wide gutter with 4 to 6 feet of wash-dii t aver aging \u00a3 oz per load, has been discovered, and the company is now fairly getting to work. A number of claims have been taken up, both noith and south of the Extended, and it is contemplated to erect steam machinery on two of them. E 2 Occupation. Europeans.

This makes the second steam engine now in course of erection at the Barfold. Nothing further of marked interest has come under my notice during the month. In a general view of the Taradale gold fields mining operations are extremely dull. There are 32 men employed, who all are shareholders. The company still offer shares for sale, which at present are valued at \u00a33 each. Maldon Division, (Robert Nankivell, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The party who are tunnelling in private property at Scorpion Hill, have obtained up to the present time, 73^ oz. of gold. They have excavated the tunnel 1000 feet into the hill. Several parties of miners are working in different parts of the old ground, along the valley of the Back Creek, between the Coliban River and the Ironstone Hill, but nothing of marked interest has transpired during the month. Malmsbury Gold Field \u2014 A new discovery has been made of some auriferous deposit at a place on Kangaroo Creek, about nine miles southward of Malmsbury, where a prospector's privilege of 10,000 square feet has been taken up. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The success of McClure and party in raising some good quartz from the old Coliban Reef has excited the enterprise of others. There are now seven shafts being sunk in the line of the reef, in hopes of striking it, and eight other claims have been marked off, and are being shepherded. A new puddling machine has lately been constructed on the Coliban River, in Jeffer son's paddock. The party having found a small auriferous gully, stretching from Jeffer son's Reef to the river, determined upon washing the soil through a horse machine. The Star Company, or Gateskell's tunnel ling party, have again hit upon gold. They have excavated a branch adit to the southward of the main tunnel, and have traced a small deposit of auriferous drift for a distance of 45 feet ; but they have not yet washed up any part of it. Three engines have been removed to other districts, which accounts for the decrease in the monthly table. Since the recent rains here the alluvial diggers have been very busy ; a number of extended claims have been taken up, and things present an active appearance. The number of diggers at Nuggety and Bradford continue about the same, and the majority are earning fair average wages. Another engine for alluvial mining has been erected on the Government road to Pickpocket. A shaft on their ground has been bottomed with fair prospects, and washing will be com menced next week. The two other companies at this place have not yet discovered payable ground. Taradale Eastward, or Victoria Field. \u2014 There has been a prospector's privilege of 10,000 feet taken up on the Coliban River, about a mile northwards of Taradale ; but it is merely a further extension of an abandoned patch formerly wrought ; and a new puddling machine is being put up at the mouth of Specimen Gully, to wash the old worked ground.

On the west of the Jim Crow Creek several parties are doing well Those persons who had taken up associated claims on the Loddon have tried hard to bottom the ground, but without success One party has applied for protection pending the erection of machinery. The small rush near Newstead, on the Castlemaine road, mentioned in my April report, still continues, and is steadily im proving. Two 6 oz. nuggets have been found, and two or three of the claims are now paying 2 oz. to the load. The two steam puddling companies in Maldon are not earning wages : the Porcupine Company only washed during the last fort night 12 oz. 6 dwt. of gold tiom 1018 truck loads of dirt. The yields of the Eagle Hawk Company are also smaller than usual this month, which may be accounted for by the stoppage occasioned in changing the stamper boxes, the old ones being replaced by Evans's patent splash-boxes. I have seen these, and find it is the introduc tion of an old system, which has been in vogue in the mines of Devon and Cornwall for stamp ing tiu for many years, and I feel fully assured, from what I know of them, that they will succeed. The principle of this box is to dis charge over the top, instead of through gratings, as in the old ones. The South Linscot Company's returns are very good. From 300 tons of quartz crushed by this company. 838 oz. 11 dwt of amalgam have been obtained, but not yet retorted. The Union Company are still engaged in erecting Chilian wheels for amalgamating, instead of ripples. Returns, nil. The plant of the Maldon Washing Company has been undergoing repairs, consequently their returns have also been very small this month. All the puddlers' dams in the district are now full ; horse puddling is being vigorously pursued. An abandoned reef between the Township and Nuggety has lately been re-rushed. The prospectors took from an old shaft near the surface two tons of quartz, which produced 1 5 oz. of gold ; since which, 7 tons have been crushed from the same reef, .which yielded 16 oz. 11 dwt. This reef had been idle up wards of three years, but since this discovery several claims have been taken up. With this I forward a tracing of the splash box mentioned above. St. Andrew's Division. (James Murphy, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 From Walker's claim, on Nuggety Reef, 145 tons have been crushed, producing 423 oz. 7 dwt. of fine gold. Another party, from the same reef have crushed 46 tons, realizing 1 7 1 oz. 1 1 dwt. The celebrated claim of Messrs. Miller and Company has not been quite so productive this month, the reef opening out to a wider extent, viz., 18 feet, was taken out indiscriminately, which only averaged half an ounce to the ton. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The Atlas Company has been chiefly engaged in crushing for the public during the last month. Some trial stuff has been sent to this mill from Gipps Land, the owners of the quartz sent preferring the method of amalga mation adopted by this company. They have also been crushing some trial stuff from the Concord, viz., 8 tons, from which 1 oz. 4\u00a3 dwt. was extracted. Most companies here try the Atlas mills, as a test for their own machinery. The Grand Junction Company has, like the Union and Concord Companies, found the ripple boxes inefficient, and the works are now stopt for the purpose of making alterations. The yields of the Beehive Company have again fallen off this month ; 232 oz. have been extracted from 587 tons, but better returns are expected during the ensuing month. Occupation. Europeans.

I have great pleasure in being able to state that my expectations as to increase of popula tion, stated in my last report, have been to a great extent realized, by an addition of 167 to the number of miners reported for the month of May. If all who arrived on these gold fields during the past month had remained, the mining population in this division would now number some thousands; but fully one- half of those who go to the Mountain rush or Moore's diggings, do no more than encamp there for one night, and return the next day without making even an attempt at gold digging. the washing stuff, which varies in thickness from 4 to 9 inches, resting upon gray, rubbly shale. The yield of gold is from 2 to 3 dwt. to the tub. There are about 140 miners at work there at present. Welcome Gully commences at what is called Ferny Hill, about two miles from Eltham, and falls into the Yarra at. a point about a mile and a half from that township The depth of sink ing varies from four to ten feet and is in every other respect similar to Sawpit Gully except that the washing stuff rests upon brown sand stone. The average yield is from one to two pennyweights of gold to the tub. One great drawback, however, is, that a great part of this gully is in private property ; to the boundary of which payable gold has been traced. The height of a point on Moore's Creek, about half a mile from its source, is 930 feet above the level of Queenstown (barometric measurement); the cold consequent on which, and the dampness of the place, from its being covered with dense scrub, certainly makes it uninviting in its aspect, and disagreeable to live in; and along with these discomforts the diggers there are obliged to stand in water all the time they are at work, there being nothing as yet gone into but creek working. These, so far as this new gold field is concerned, are the prin cipal causes of so many people returning, as I am satisfied that every man at work there now is making, at least, a good living ; many are doing a good deal more. At Swiper's Gully most of the miners are making a living, as claims can be had there now more easily than when I last reported, as many have left for Sawpit and Welcome Gullies. Prospecting has been going on during the past month at Ferny Hill [see sketch), but I am sorry to say, the prospects obtained are not such as would pay for tub washing This hill, on the summit of which there is a deposit of quartzose sand and small waterworn quartz boulders, about 20 feet deep, is one of a series of hills of similar formation, standing at inter vals round the Kangaroo Ground the soil on which is remarkable for its close resemblance to that of the swamp between North Melbourne and the junction of the Saltwater River with the Yarra. This gold field, since its first discovery by Moore, in February last, is found to extend a distance of about five miles in a north-easterly direction, across four other branches of Moore's Creek, all of which are found to be highly auriferous ; and I have no doubt that when the summer weather sets in, numerous other creeks and gullies will be discovered in this hitherto unexplored part of the country. And here I would state that there are serious doubts as to whether this new gold field is in the Castle maine or in the Sandhurst mining district, the locality being totally unsurveyed, and in every sense a terra incognita, from the dense scrub with which it is covered; and this important question cannot be determined unless by actual survey, involving much labor and expense. Of the other creeks and gullies in this di vision there is nothing to report beyond the everyday occurrences of shallow sinking and tab washing in old ground; however, from the great ingress of strangers occurring just now, many of whom have had a great deal of ex perience upon other and more crowded gold fields. I have no doubt that ere long much of this old ground will be taken up by machine puddlers ; who it is to be hoped will introduce the efficient methods of working applied else where instead of those generally used here at present, aud adhered to with such tenacity. Prospecting in the country lying between the Kangaroo Ground and the Yarra, has, I am happy to state, been to some extent successful during the past month, inasmuch as two auriferous gullies have been discovered, one of which is called Sawpit Gully, and the other Welcome Gully (see sketch) Sawpit Gully commences near the S.E. corner of block 1, section 4, in the parish of Nillumbik, and falls into the Yarra about a mile below the junction of Watson's Creek with that river. In quartz mining nothing worth noting has occurred since my last report ; in fact this branch of mining is rather dull at present; the at tention of the miners being principally directed to the very remunerative alluvial workings on the Mountain or Moore's diggings, where many ot the old and trained quartz miners may now be found engaged in sluice washing and in prospecting the' country around. The amount of quartz crushed during the month of June is 130 tons ; the average yield of gold 3 oz. per ton. This gully is rather more than a mile in length, notwithstanding which it has been marked out in claims from end to end during the past week. The sinking varies from 8 to 1 2 feet, first through about a foot of soil, and then through the usual yellow gravelly clay to There are but two leasehold companies in this division now : the Yarra Yarra Mining"], [251, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 JUNE. 233 Company, and the One-tree Hill Company. both of which have suspended their operations for some time.

The following is a Detailed Statement of the Machinery, Depth cf Shafts, Number of Men Employed, &c, &c, by the Companies employing Steam Engines. There has been a slight improvement in mining matters during the month, resulting partly from the abundant supply of water furnished by the late rains to the puddlers and sluicing companies, and partly from the fact that several of the large companies which had been for many months engaged in sinking, erecting machinery, and driving, have at last obtained encouraging prospects. The erection of whims and steam engines on the deep leads goes steadily on, and the miners engaged in these operations speak with hope and confidence of the probable result of then next month's labor. The only unoccupied site in the neighbor hood of Beaufort that could possibly be available for mining purposes, the northern portion of the police paddock, hitherto a Government reserve, is about to be operated on by two engine parties, whilst those com panies who could not succeed in obtaining areas in the same vicinity have taken up claims on the lower end of the various gullies on the northern side of the dividing range, in the immediate neighborhood of Waterloo Flat. The division continues to attract parties of alluvial miners who have previously been em ployed in the deep sinking at Camgham, Linton's, Brown's, and Smythesdale. Unity and the neighboring gullies on the margin of this gold field towards Camgham continue to give a fair return to the mining population engaged there, both Chinese and European. On the Southern Cross or Cumberland Lead the prospectors have erected a 10 horse-power engine and are sinking a new shaft, the old one being too small ; theh- neighbors to the northward, the Royal Saxon Company, have obtained a payable prospect. To the south ward of the prospectors claims. Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 are already yielding good dividends weekly, amounting in one instance to \u00a38 per man. Nos. 7 and 8 are also proving remune rative, and R. Humphries and party, the pro prietors of No 9. have just washed 25 dwt. from the bottom of their shaft. I have no hesitation in reporting the South ern Cross lo be, according to its area, one of the most promising leads in the division. The Old Yam Hill continues to give employ ment to a number of tub and cradle men, in addition to a sluicing company and two or three puddling machines.

The shaft of the Reservoir Company, from the bottom of which a little gold was recently obtained at a depth of 82 feet, has since been opened out at too great a depth ; the men are therefore putting in a new drive at a higher level, and are sanguine of being able to reach the lead in a few days, should the water not prove too heavy to enable them to do so without an engine. The Golden Age Company have obtained a little gold at a depth of 115 feet ; it is sup posed that the gutter they are crossing is the Ding-dong, and not the Main Lead ; at all events their claim cannot be said to be proved until they reach the Northern Reef. The Fiery Creek Company have driven 1 00 feet, and obtained a very good prospect at a depth of 102 feet from the surface, but have not yet reached the gutter. The Champion of the Seas Company have just completed the erection of a 14 horse-power engine, and will shortly have the lifts at work and the claim unwatered. Between this claim and the West of England a piece of spare ground has been awarded to the jumpers, who have just commenced sinking a shaft. The Marco Polo Company have been work ing the reef between the Main and the Argyle Leads, with but poor, although somewhat improving, results, the water being as yet too heavy to allow them to reach the deep ground and discover the junction. The West of England Company, whose claim appears to have been driven for a long time in the wrong direction and at too low a level, have lately obtained a fair prospect at a depth of 100 feet, but their wash-dirt appears to be very thin, as the result shown from washing by puddling machine is far inferior to indications shown on the trial washing by tub and cradle. The Raglan Company's claim is yielding a good return, and has recently produced 6 oz. gold from one load of wash-dirt. On the Argyle Lead the Royal Oak Com pany have realized exceedingly well from the lower end of their claim, adjoining that of the Marco Polo Company, which they have worked out, and are engaged in sinking a fresh shaft. The Garibaldi Company who had the mis fortune to lose their shaft during the last month have exhibited great activity in sinking a new one, and removing their engine to its new site at the north end of their claim ; they will probably see the bottom of the new shaft in the course of a week The Better-late-than-never Company have also obtained some rich dirt lately, exclusive of nuggets. The parties of Chinese on this lead are also doing remarkably well ; and the Flying Buck Company, whose claim is situate between that of the Chinese and that of the Raglan Com pany, have just obtained a prospect of 1 oz. to the tub. The Royal Standard Company, whose opera tions have been somewhat retarded by the non arrival of their engine, consequent on the badness of the roads, have at length got it on the claim, and are rapidly proceeding with its erection. At the end of New Charcoal Gully a whim claim is at work near its supposed junction with the Main Lead ; the party seem confident of success. The machinery on the claims of the Olive Branch and Great Republic Companies nearly approaches completion, and the engines will be at work very shortly. To the westward of this claim, known as Farley's, there is a very considerable number of Chinese, several parties of whom are busily tracing a spur of the Old or Main Lead, and a very small proportion of Europeans employed ; the latter consisting chiefly of the owners of puddling machines, and the men employed by the Red Hill, Raglan, and Wimmera Sluicing Companies, whose operations are carried on with great vigor. On the Ding-dong, or Cornish Lead, the only claims at work are the Prospect, or Union Jack, and No. 3 South, both of which are yielding handsome returns. No. 1 North, some time known as the West of England (Jompany's claim, has been a second time abandoned as non-remunerative. On McCookc's Lead the population em ployed is limited to the prospect party, who have sunk a new shaft, and who still continue to obtain rich wash-dirt. Visiting Charlton I find that the population there has dwindled to less than 100 men, in cluding Chinese, who are mostly making good wages, either with tub and cradle, torn or puddling machine. On the Main Lead the miners are all san guine of success. A shaft is being sunk by F"], [254, "236 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 JUNE. Onward towards Waterloo Flat the Slaugh teryard Hill, Cosmopolitan, Black Swamp, and Bagster's Leads, are nearly deserted at present ; indeed the majority of the mining population both in this section of the division and on the old workings generally, consist of Chinese. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 On the Waterloo side of the dividing range a small number of Europeans are working in Perseverance Gully, with every prospect of tracing a shallow lead towards the flat. At Paddy's Gully about forty men have taken up claims below the point where the lead had previously been abandoned for want of machinery ; and a number of Chinese are doing well in the old ground immediately above them. At Waterloo Hill, the Waterloo Sluicing Company, the Puddling Company, and the Chinese tub and cradle men, are making fair average wages. At Jonathan's Gully the depth of sinking is from 60 to 75 feet, and the miners are en deavoring to trace a lead from the prospectors' claim, which although not as rich as they expected, is yet a payable one. Aggregate value of mining plant in the division \u00a36500. There is but little to report, except the arrival of twenty-four men from the Ballaarat district, who have taken up an extended claim on the Upper Wet Lead. They have purchased a steam engine of 12 horse-power, and intend to commence operations at once. At Commissioner's Hill the Rising Sun Company have been furnished with a steam engine, and are about to recommence opera tions on their old claim. At the time this claim was swamped out it had been yielding about J oz. to the load; the lead being 35 feet wide, with 5 feet of wash-dirt. The great want of this division is an accession of men, capital, and machinery, such as has lately taken place in the Raglan division. The Wet Lead near Mr. Ewbank's station, the Upper Wet Lead in the viciniiy of the Old Canton Lead, and the Rock Lead on the banks of the Hopkins River, offer a wide field for specula tion, and one which would, if judiciously operated upon, both prove remunerative and materially increase the yield of gold in this division At Wingfield's Gully the Chinese Whim Claim continues to pay ; the Great Extended and Golden Gate Companies are still engaged in searching for a continuation of this lead, but up to the present time without success. At Surface Point, Jury and Company's sluicing party are getting fair returns, and at Poverty Point a few tub and cradle men are getting paid for their labor. Parties continue to prospect for quartz reefs with tolerably good indications of success. Owing to the want of a system of registration, considerable difficulty is experienced in obtain ing correct information as to the yield of gold in the Raglan Division. Ararat Division, The population is as follows : \u2014 At the Mullock Bank the extended claim is yielding over 1 oz. to the load, with a good depth of wash-dirt. The Picnic Gully, Mitchell's Gully, and Cement Hill are still yielding a good portion of gold. There are several prospecting parties sink ing in various places in untried ground. The greater part of the tunnells are still yielding gold in payable quantities. Quartz Mining. \u2014 At Campbell's Reef, 306 tons of quartz crushed during the month have yielded an average of 7| oz of gold per ton. 234 tons of \" casing\" yielded \u00a3 oz. of gold per ton.

The population is as follows : \u2014 In addition to the claims mentioned, nearly twenty others have been taken up within the last fortnight on the supposed course of the reef. On the Cross Reef, although there are no very rich crushings to record during the past month, the old claims, with the exception of two that are registered, continue in full work, and a large quantity of quartz is still being raised. At the southern end, in the Ireland's Eye Claim (Messrs. Scallan and Company's), a new and rich reef has been struck at a depth of 180 feet, the stone from which looks very promising. At the northern end, the proprietors of claims Nos. 3, 4, and 5, North, are proceeding with the erection of their engine, which is intended for draining their claims, and will, when completed, enable them to raise quartz from below the water level. Total population in the division, 9500. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 On the Scotchman's Reef the prospecting claim and four others are raising stone, some of which have lately yielded well ; a kiln lately crushed for McKellar and Company, of over 100 tons, yielded 3 oz. to the ton, and the next kiln it is confidently expected will yield considerably more. Payable stone is also being raised from claim No. 2, North, (Messrs. Crothers, Wakeham, and Company) ; the last kiln yielded 13 dwt. to the ton, and the stone now being raised promises to be equally re munerative The following is an approximate statement of the number of engines employed in crushing quartz in the division, with the average yields : \u2014 Aggregate value of all mining plant in the division \u00a341,000.

Quartz Mining. \u2014 In connection with the progress of quartz mining in this division, I have to report that the prospecting party, who have been for nearly two years engaged on the Birmingham Reef, have lately struck pay able stone at a depth of about 90 feet ; this party some weeks since amalgamated their claim with claim No. 2, South, for the purpose of further testing the reef, and the result has been the discovery referred to; the place where they are at present breaking through the reef is situated about the boundary of the two claims, and from present appearances it may fairly be expected that good returns will shortly be realized; as the whole of the reef has not vet been gone through, it is impossible to say at present what thickness of stone is auriferous. .... _ i u In the prospecting claim the reef has been gone through at difterent depths, and gold in small quantities obtained ; a trial kiln some * Chiefly cement. t In course of erection. t Not at work. \u00a7 For winding only.

A directory has been appointed and no tices have been given of intention to apply for two leases, one including the ground to be worked, the other for machinery purposes A large portion of the company's ground has already been proved to be auriferous, and pay able quartz has been obtained both above and below the water level. The Wild Cat, Caledonian, Nuggety, Mari ner's, and Moonlight Reefs show but little progress. Alluvial and cement mining. \u2014 On the allu vial workings there is not much of importance to record. The greater part of the population is still engaged at the Four Posts Rush, and a considerable number are still remuneratively employed there. The lead since last report has not been traced much further, but as the wash-dirt at present being raised does not con tain such a large proportion of cement as for merly, the cost of crushing is, in some cases, saved to the claimholders. On the Hampshire Reef a number of claims are at present registered. The owners of claims of Nos. 1 , 2, and 3, North, have amalgamated them in order to test the reef at a greater depth. The result of this trial is looked forward to with great interest, as, in the event of any fur ther discovery being made, there is little doubt but that the whole of the claims on that line will soon resume work. At the Forty-foot and Seventy-foot Hills, in the neighborhood of No. 3 Reservoir, several parties have taken up claims on the abandoned leads, and in one case a tunnel is being driven to enable the miners to work the ground with greater economy and efficiency; consequently some time must elapse before the success of these latter operations can be proved. Mia Mia Flat, and Sebastopol and Silver Shilling Hills afford employment to about 200 men. These workings generally are not very rich, but occasionally yield a handsome return. Cement wash-dirt throughout this division yields from 15 dwt. to 18 oz. to the ton. On the Perthshire Reef Messrs. Jennings and Companv lately crushed a kiln of about 100 tons, the yield from which was 15 dwt. to the ton. A reef of great thickness is found in this claim, the whole of which it is expected would pay for taking out if the necessary machinery for crushing were erected on the ground. Mr Ashton is busily engaged in preparing complete apparatus for trying Porter's process on an improved principle, and on a large scale.

In alluvial mining in my division for the past month I find an increase of 8 Europeans and 54 Chinese, and all are steadily employed, the heavy fall of rain being favorable to their operations, and from the Europeans I have ascertained that they are making above the average current wages of the district. Several Chinese parties have purchased the alluvial ground on claims in the possession of quartz miniog companies, which they wash from top to bottom ; and, from their co-operative and economical system of working, I am satisfied they get fair returns. In quartz mining, my report for the month is condensed in the tabular form of information from the different companies ; no new ground has been applied for, nor any matter of interest having come to my knowledge in the present workings of these companies. A number of claims taken up some months since have been recently abandoned as unsuccessful specula tions, and several are held under protection registration for periods of one to three months, at the expiration of which they intend to resume operations. The causes assigned, as required by the Mining Board bye-law, are various : some from insufficient funds to carry on the work, some to get time to re-organize the company, and get out defaulting share holders, and others to make trial crushings of quartz already raised. The only company I am aware of at present who is contemplating erecting machinery is that known as Dimock and Company, on Dimock's Reef, Little Bendigo. This company has spent a large amount of money in prospecting this reef, with various success. From a level at 60 feet the prospect from a trial crushing of 40 tons, yielded 9 dwt. to the ton ; but, after sinking to a depth of 140 feet, the prospect was only 3 dwt. per ton. However, a number of the shareholders have confidence in the ultimate success of the claim. The Swiss and French Company on this reef, and immediately south of Dimock's, have sunk a shaft to a depth of 105 feet (and, being on low ground, equal to about 1 90 at Dimock's shaft), found the reef 20 feet west from the shaft, 7 feet thick. They raised and had about 9 tons crushed, which yielded 2 oz. of gold. They intend to sink a further depth of 60 feet, and prospect again before erecting machinery. The Sisters Company, on the Band of Hope Reef, have their machinery nearly completed, and will be crushing in a few days. No. 3 Division. (Thomas Cowan, Mining Surveyor.)

The following information has been obtained relative to the quantity of Quartz crashed during the month, and the Gold obtained therefrom : \u2014 I beg to forward a return showing the number of mining companies at work within my district, together with the quantity of quartz crushed and the average yield per ton. I may state that I have found some difficulty in obtaining reliable returns, as some of the companies whose claims do not pay well are unwilling to give information, as the publication of the yields obtained might tend to prevent the sale of shares and injure the credit of the company. From one company I have not been able to obtain any return, but those forwarded I believe will be found correct. \u25a0 The plan forwarded shows a very curious fault in a quartz lode, which was discovered in the claim of the Llanberris Company, Gum tree Flat, at a depth of 180 feet from the surface. In this instance the lode seems to have been quite displaced by a mass of schist rock and the continuation of the quartz was found con siderably to the south of the former line of the lode. This instance will serve as a warning to persons working quartz lodes not to abandon their claim because the lode may have been lost for a time, as these faults havffbeen found in many places, though I have seen few of so extensive a nature. It will be seen that the lode seems to have taken quite another parallel line, but further work may show that the original line is returned at a greater depth. It will be seen that the number of alluvial companies in my district is the same as already stated in previous returns, but there is a con siderable increase in the number of quartz companies which have actually erected crushing machinery. In alluvial mining there is nothing which calls for special mention, the yields continuing to keep up their usual average. In quartz mining, however, there is a great deal of activity, but the yields obtained have scarcely realized the expectations of the projectors of the various companies.

The spirit of enterprise shown in this branch of mining industry is worthy of great praise, as the miners frequently work for long periods despite discouraging appearances and small yields ; as an instance, I may mention the Speedwell Company, on Poverty Point, are about to sink their shaft to the depth of 200 or 300 feet below the water level. The quartz at the present depth, 1 60 feet, is not found to be so profitable as the company expected, and they are about undertaking the work mentioned in order to test the value of the quartz lodes on Ballaarat and at greater depths than they have yet been worked. It is obvious that the results obtained from the work will go far to determine the much disputed question as to the value of quartz lodes at great depths; for if this lode is found to pay at the depth to which the company purpose sinking they may be considered as inexhaustible, at all events for many years. The company, I believe, are about to ask for subscriptions in aid of the work, as it is felt to be one of much importance to the district, and they themselves have not been so fortunate as to have much spare capital at command. The work will, undoubtedly, be useful. accessories necessary for carrying on quartz crushing operations. They have an engine of the horse-power of 35 horses for crushing, and one of the power of 10 horses for winding and pumping purposes. There are twenty-nine shareholders in the company, all of whom are Chinese, with the exception of the manager, who is a European. They have sunk a shaft to the depth of 130 feet, and have driven 40 feet, cut- ting a lode of some 20 feet in breadth. From the trial crushings made, it is expected that the yield will be about 5 dwt to the ton. The working of the lodes for a lengthened period has led to some modifications being made in the methods of work. At first the quartz was taken out without much regard to system or to the future security of the ground ; the consequence is that some of the claims have fallen in, and in one instance, namely, Peake and party, Old Post Office Hill, the work has been stopped. In this claim the ground has sunk in without breaking the timber, and although the props are still standing, apparently uninjured, the drives have become so dangerous that the men can no longer work. This has resulted from the earth slipping down between the timbers, and shows the necessity of some other precautions being taken in order to render the claim secure. I may mention that no per- manent injury has been done to the workings in this claim, for so soon as the ground shall have settled down the men will be able to resume their labors. In order, however, to avoid delay, companies will do well to take ample precautions, and several companies have already adopted measures which are likely to be effectual. If the lode proves paying, capitalists will feel increased confidence in erecting costly machinery, and generally in quartz mining enterprises. In my district there is a company worthy of special mention, as it is, perhaps, the only quartz mining company in the colony which is composed of Chinese. The company, which is known under the name of Hon Sen and Company, have a claim on the Canadian Range, on which they have erected a battery of 12 stamps, with all the The plan followed is, to sink an extra shaft on the old or worked out drives, down which the tailings taken from the sand pits are thrown, thus filling up the drives and rendering the claim secure. This method entails very little extra trouble, and secures the ground effectually ; for experience has proved that timber cannot be rebed on as a permanent support for the superincumbent mass.

Frenchman's Lead \u2014 The Nelson Company on this lead have recently got into what they consider the gutter, and have obtained very encouraging prospects, though owing to their being a little too shallow for the deep ground, they have not as yet done much in the way of getting up wash-dirt ; but judging from the small quantities tested, the claim is likely to be very rich, and. in consequence, shares are quoted at high figures, and held firmly The Working Miners' Company are also B lluvial lining.

Black Lead. \u2014 The Scottish and Cornish Company are engaged in getting up new machinery, the old being insufficient for the great body of water met with in the working of the claim. The Pluribus-in-Unum Company, to the south of the Scottish and Cornish, have also issued a prospectus lately offering shares on what appears to be very fair terms. Should they succeed in organizing a good company with sufficient capital, I have no doubt they will be well rewarded upon reaching the gutter, as there is every probability of the Main or Grand Trunk Lead passing through the com pany's claim in its southern course after its junction with the Black Lead, which is expected to take place in the claim of the Scottish and Cornish Company. Shares in this company command exceed ingly high prices. One was sold a few weeks since at \u00a3900; and, I am informed, as high as \u00a3950 could now be got. There seems to be a general opinion that the Main Lead is likely to pass through this company's ground, and that its junction with Frenchman's is not far from their shaft. If this be so, there is reason to expect that the claim will be the richest in the colony, and therefore, the present extraordi nary high prices of shares. Cobbler's Lead. \u2014 The Prince of Wales Com pany have just completed the erection of their new plant, which is, perhaps, the largest and most substantial in the district. They expect to clear out the water in readiness, and to resume underground operations during the month. The Staffordshire Reef still continues to give good returns. The Mentor Company crushed during the month 294 tons of stone (vide annexed form) from a 150 feet level, which averaged 6J dwts. per ton. The vein from which the above returns were obtained is from 6 to 12 feet wide, and is now opened up in the best possible manner for about 300 feet, so that in a very short time sufficient stone can be raised to supply a battery of 24 head of stamps. This company also crushed during the month 117 tons for the Rose, Thistle, and Shamrock Company (14 South) from a 120 feet level, which yielded 6 dwts per ton. This company (the Rose, Thistle, and Shamrock) have not yet succeeded in negotiating for machinery, but are about doing so. The Britannia Com pany (10 South) have the machinery nearly erected, it consists of 6 head of stamps, and as a whole is a creditable plant. The Comet Company crushed during the month 202 tons of quartz from a 120 feet level, and from a vein 11 feet wide Ca continuation of the Mentor Company's) which gave 6f dwts. per ton. The Oriental Company's claim I regret to say does not improve in point of yield, their last month's crushing of 400 tons realizing only 3 dwts. per ton. They have been obliged to dispense with almost all their hired labor, and now purpose testing the ground themselves for economy's sake. Though this company have not hitherto been successful in obtaining remunerative re turns, they are still confident of being ultimately remunerated, as they believe they also will have the Main Lead within their claim, and expect its junction with Cobbler's to be in the vicinity of their shaft ; and upon the strength of this belief shares have got up about 100 per cent, during the last four months. The present price is between \u00a3500 and \u00a3600, and difficult to be had ; though some four or five months since they were freely offered at \u00a3275. The Camp Company are, as usual, doing well; their average returns being about \u00a311 per man weekly. Prospect Lead. \u2014 The Alston and Weardale Company are still vigorously engaged in driving for the gutter, but owing to the hardness of the reef they are making but slow progress ; how ever they are firmly bent on persevering, and in high hopes of being amply rewarded sooner or later for all their labor and expenditure, as they believe, they too, will have the Main Lead within their claim, and not more than 600 feet from their shaft. Penrose's Reef, Moonlight. \u2014 The Great Eastern Company crushed during the month for Penrose and Company, the prospectors, 320 tons of stone from a depth of 30 feet, which averaged 6j dwts. per ton. This company also had during the month a trial crushing of 20 tons of quartz from the Caledonian Company (2 South) from a depth of 12 feet, which realized 3-J dwts per ton. The promoters of the Great Gulf Company, to the south of the Alston and Weardale, have recently issued a prospectus, with a view of forming a company under Pyke's Act ; and from the liberal terms offered, they expect to have the shares speedily taken up. I believe the claim stands well for the Main Lead, and provided adequate machinery be in the first in stance provided, I am of opinion, with the experience in rock sinking which the miners of the district presently possesses, that the gutter The rush to Montrose Hill, Bulldog, has almost entirely fallen away.

The Great Britain Company, Durham, are at present prospecting on the reef, but have not yet met with any great success. The Standard Company, on Hiscock's Reef, have crushed but little during the month, being engaged in sinking, in order to test the reef at a deeper level. The Polar Star Company have decided on sinking their shaft 16 feet deeper, and will commence operations immediately. The One-and-All Company, Hiscock's, are at work with the usual result, having crushed about 800 tons of quartz, yielding about 3 dwt. per ton. The Franklyn Company, on the Franklyn Lead, is still endeavoring to reduce the water, which has for some time past precluded them from getting at the face, but I am informed that there is every probability of work being resumed in a few days.

I have the honor to forward you the fol lowing report of the state of this mining dis trict for the month of July, 1861 : \u2014 On the Old Flat, opposite the Nugget Hotel, there are two steam engines erected \u2014 one for the purpose of assisting in working the large flat of unworked ground that stretches from the Chinaman's Hill southwards towards the township, the other for puddling the old 'uropeans. tese. for Ivision. \u25a0mar! .lluvial miners [uartz miners . . . 4,280 220 9,550 850 100 5,130 220 ither population 9,650 Totals 14,050 950 15,000 .lluvial lining.

Brownsvale Paddock. The Brownsvale Com pany are making arrangements for puddling. The Waterloo Company are sinking a new shaft. The Prince of Wales, Kossuth, Star of the North, and Emeu are paying very well of late. The other claims on Italians are indifferent. Near Whybrow's Gully, about three-quar ters of a mile westward of the creek, a quartz reef has been struck, which yielded 6 oz. to 10 tons. A rush of course ensued the announcement. The trial is too limited to warrant an opinion of its real qualities ; but no doubt, in the course of a month or two, we shall be better able to judge. The Scotchman's Reef Prospecting Com pany have not been able to crush any yet, owing to some disorder in the erection of the machinery. I believe it has been now placed in competent hands, and will be soon ready for work. The several claims on the Smythesdale Flat are going steadily on, without any significant change for better or worse. The Perseverance Company, on Warren's Lead, have had a stop page, in consequence of a boiler explosion. They have suffered no other injuries than the suspension of their works. The Grand Trunk and Try Again Compa nies have their engines nearly fitted up. The Cleft of the Rock have been obtaining better wash-dirt lately ; they, however, are not doing so well as was anticipated, nor as the situation of the ground would induce one to expect. The Band of Hope had \u00a36 last week. The ground in this claim is greatly improving, and gives promising indications of becoming per manently good. The Grand Junction and Robin Hood are busily erecting steam engines of very large size. The shaft of the latter company is very deep, its situation is highly favorable. The British have got nothing yet ; they have been driving for a long time. The North American is giving magnificent returns. A heavy case of litigation between themselves and their neighbors, the Centaur, seems imminent, because of an encroachment by the former on the ground applied for on lease by the latter, but which lease has not been issued yet. The Great Western divided \u00a316 per man last week. The Beaumont is a splendid claim. They got a nugget weighing 12 lbs. about three weeks ago. The Caledonia is getting on favorably. The Mines Royal, Red Hill, and Reliance are very poor. The Smythe's and Browne's Junction, and the Golden Gate, are very good. The Cr\u0153sus pays fair wages. The Washington doing very well. They have discovered a new lead whilst working in their claim, and availed themselves of its benefit by taking up an additional claim on it. There are very good patches still occa sionally met -with on Weston's Hill and Dreamer's HilL On Happy Valley, the Menai Straits, Cham pion of the Seas, and Ivanhoe claims are giving very good returns. The Don Juan, Golden Gate, and Lucky shafts are nearly bottomed. The Lord Nelson and Duke of Wellington claims have not got gold yet j their prospects seem to be very good. The Lord Palmerston have given up. The Lord John Russell are making good wages. The Undaunted, Lugar, and Rip Van Winkle have not struck anything as yet. The Bute is very highly spoken of. The Scarsdale and Gemini shaft is very deep. It is clear that it is on the deep ground, or very near it. From the number of claims that will be in profitable working operation, both in Lucky Woman's and Spring Dallah, within the ensuing twelve months, there is every reason to believe that the prosperity of these localities will not be exceeded by that of any other gold bearing district in the colony. There has been nothing yet got out of the new shafts of the Grand Junction and Hand in-Hand, Browne's. The United Browne's is getting excellent wash-dirt on the North Briton Lead. The old lead is being re-worked for the third or fourth time by the Chinese. In quartz reefing there has been nothing done lately, with the exception of the British Workman Company, who are making from \u00a36 to \u00a38 per week. The Success Company have issued a prospectus, with a view to re-organize the company. They have not crushed any lately. I do not think the Hand-in-Hand and Grand Junction Companies have got out any wash-dirt from their new shafts. The Falcon .and Working Miners are doing very well. The Havelock and Prince of Wales excellent. The Cambrian are sinking a new shaft near The Atlas Claim at Linton's have been doing very well within the last week ; they have got several small nuggets out of it. The Duke of Cornwall is not doing much yet. The John Bull have bottomed. Neither this company nor the Pioneer, in Linton Paddock, have got anything yet. The Little Wonder and Edin burgh still continue to yield as usual. The Flying Buck and other companies up the Standard Lead are doing well. A new run, proceeding from the Sailors'"], [271, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 JULY. 251 Gully and falling into No. 4, on the Standard, had been discovered a few weeks ago, and, since then, a shaft sunk on a part of it, and the ground proved to be very rich. The Redan and John Bull, on the Black Lead, are doing about the same as usual, making good wages. a very good claim from its commencement : they had \u00a315 per man last week ; the Great Britain \u00a36 ; the Bedfordshire, \u00a34. On the Rock Lead the Gnome and Magnum Bonum are the only claims that are yielding anything worth working for. On the Quartz Reef the Britannia Company have opened the main drive in their new shaft. They have got a new battery, and intend to commence crushing at once. Puddling, sluicing, and paddocking are carried on on the shallow ground towards the north of Linton's, the heavy rains facilitating operations of this kind. Johnson's Reef remains idle still. The Chester Castle Company are sinking slowly. At Camgham mining matters are rather dull, although a good number of claims are paying well. On Preston's Hill (private property) matters are as good as ever. The Sherwood, at Snake Valley, has been Creswick Division. (James Stevenson, Mining Surveyor.)

On Tunnel Hill the Italian parties of miners are still with wonderful perseverance continuing to drive in, as yet however without any real suc cess ; some of the tunnels are now in over 800 feet. During the month all the diggings in the different portions of this division have been progressing in a satisfactory manner. A small influx of Italian miners into Bullarook has taken place since my last report. At Bald Hills, the Rise and Shine Company have struck payable gold at a depth of 140 feet, the prospect obtained was 14 dwts. from a tin dishfull of wash-dirt, of a coarse and nug gety kind, the company have since purchased an engine and are now preparing to erect it.

The stone from Robinson's reef has yielded better than former averages. Num ber of men employed in the mine and top work is 140. Clunes Alliance Company have finished and attached the winding and pumping gear to the main shaft, and resumed the sinking of same. The engine to work the mine has a 20-inch cylinder, the feed-pipe is worked by direct action from the cylinder, reducing friction and all strain. The fly-wheel is 15 feet 6 inches diameter, and weighs 5J tons. The driving shaft is of wrought iron, 8 inches diameter. The plummer blocks weigh more than 1 ton. The sweep rod measures 32 feet, to which is adjusted a balance box weighted with half a ton of metal ; is worked with travelling chain and pulley ; no perceptible vibration of the sweep rod can be discerned. The bob is of (fitting) massive dimensions ; the whole of the pump work is fitted to a nicety. The winding gear is very complete and strong. The truck is lowered by a break to within 20 feet from the bottom of shaft, when a signal is waited for, and it is then more slowly let down ; a protective adjustment is applied to the lever of the clutch to attach or disconnect the winding gear, avoiding the use of stay pins and liability of accident; with the like view, all parts of the engine and pump bob are fenced around with pine boards. The whole has a most permanent and clean appearance, and the engine works beautifully. They have more water in the shaft than was anticipated, and the pump has to be constantly at work The depth of the shaft is 172 feet; they intend to sink 150 feet deeper. In sinking they cut two reefs, one at 50 feet, the other at 78 feet ; they expect to cut others as they go down ; if not, cross cuts will be made, and the mine properly prospected. Their crushing engine and battery will in meantime be thoroughly put in order. They at present employ 30 men, and have expended during the past month \u00a3383 4s. 4d. I have the honor to report, that since my last, referring to mining in the Clunes portion of my district, the fitting up of the winding engines for the Clunes Alliance Company and the New North Clunes Company. A considerable ad vancement has been made in the erection of the new mining engine for the Clunes Com pany, and satisfactory improvements may be noticed in the different companies' works. The Port Phillip Company have crushed, from 29th June to 27th July, 2,815 tons of quartz, which yielded 2,008 oz. 16 dwt. 20 grs. in bar gold, average per ton 14 dwt. 65 grs. The different experiments of the company to secure the other metals, as well as gold, are not yet considered conclusive by them, namely, that they are using the most satisfactory method. The long cradle, to save the iron pyrites from the amalgamated tailings, is worked from the engine power by a very sim ple but ingeniously contrived crank, the metal has been afterwards passed through the Chilian mill in the raw state, but latterly has been first calcined, the result is not known. The whole of these works are in the most efficient state. The three large boilers work the four engines, which consist of the stamping engine of an actual working power of 60 to 70 horses, one pumping engine 6 horse-power, another 6 horse-power engine for using the Chilian mill, and a small shop engine for turning purposes of 2 horse-power, the latter is considered suffi cient for present wants. For lighting of the building kerosene oil is now used, as it has been found cheaper, and in other respects to supersede any other material. Thirty-eight men are employed on the works irrespective of wood carters and others. The Victoria Company return that they have crushed, from June 27th to July 20th, 404 tons, which yielded 162 oz. 3 dwt. 12 gr. of gold, at an average per ton of 8 dwt. and \u00a3 gr. They employ 55 men, and have ex pended \u00a3550 during the period. The cost of raising quartz per ton is 11s.; the cost of crushing, 8s. per ton. They have driven east of the block of quartz which I have stated laid eastward of the Eastern Lode, without present examination of it ; aud, at 50 feet more easterly, have just struck the wall of a lode or branch of one. It is likely to prove the Welcome Keef; but little stone has been raised from it to judge by, but its appearance is favorable. Clunes Quartz Mining Company. \u2014 The ge neral character of the mine presents no new feature. They have just cut through the Wel come Lode from the No. 2 level, northern shaft, depth, 236 feet, length of drive, 180 feet, the reef, now proved, is here nearly 14 feet thick, and the stone raised from it looks to be of a paying character. At a future period they will prospect at a greater depth for other pro bably existing reefs east and west of their pre sent mine. The masonry for the bed of the new mining engine is completed, it is the most solid struc ture in this place, the foundation for the chim ney shaft is laid, it will be 68 feet in height, I may refer to previous remarks, that they have been paying as much as \u00a345, and at \u00abJ"], [274, "254 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 JULY. one time \u00a375 per fathom, for driving on the Eastern Reef, width and height 7 feet : the accumulation of water and hardness of the store prevented the miners at that time of earning, even at those rates, more than 50s. per week The price for driving the present cross cut has been \u00a37 per fathom. Clunes United Company have crushed 339 tons, which yielded 1 50 oz. of gold. Average per ton, nearly 9 dwt. The lessened quantity was caused by an accident, and the decrease of average yield by trial crushings from the Eastern and Old Man Reefs. Criterion Company have crushed in the four weeks ending '27th July, 746 tons, which yielded 527 oz. 5 dwt. 11 gr., showing an average per ton of 14 dwt. 3 gr. They are stoping down the quartz from Robinson's Keef, north and south of the shaft. The lode varies from 1 2 to 25 feet in width. The work of securing the wrought out ground is still continued. They employ 34 men. The New North Clunes Company have started their mining engine, and will shortly complete its fittings to resume the sinking of the shaft. Various expensive contracts have been issued to forward the works. The Yankee Company have also struck the Welcome Lode, by a drive from their eastern most shaft ; the quartz has a very promising appearance, and they are but little troubled with water. The poppet heads required to work their western reefs by engine power are in position ; to connect this with the winding engine, it has been found necessary to erect a series of strong timbers braced together with rollers, upon which the rope travels. This arrangement will be discontinued so soon as they are required to sink deeper, when a cross drive will be made to allow of drainage to the pumping shaft, and the quartz from the several reefs will then be raised from one shaft only, and the stone will be conveyed by a lower tramway to the lift. The stone from the Robinson's and Eastern Lodes has scarcely equalled former yields. A lesser quantity has been raised owing to the fitting up of the shaft gear over Robinson's Lode. Expense of raising and crushing is nearly 20s. per ton. Alluvial Mining. \u2014 The Voung Sons of Freedom Company have greatly persevered ; and after driving nearly 300 feet, sinking with some difficulty they have come upon paying ground. John Bull Company earn from \u00a33 to \u00a34 per man weekly. Southern Lights Company (prospecting party, Southern Hill,) are swamped out by the influx of water from the abandoned shaft put down by the Haphazard Company. They are baling it out, and after three weeks labor at it are still uncertain of beating it. Quantity of quartz crushed, 309 tons ; total yield, 355 oz. 7 dwt. ; average per ton, 1 oz. 3 dwt. ; average cost of raising and crashing, 20s. per ton. Number of men employed, 50.

The Kangaroo Company are working Hick's Reef at a depth of 232 feet ; at this depth they struck a little water in the reef. In driving north and south from the main shaft, the reef gradually reduces in thickness, until it finally disappears. It does not present the appearance of a break, but a wearing out.

The Union Company have withdrawn their lease, owing to their having expended their capital (as per application) and the difficulty in finding the Birmingham Reef vein. The Perseverance Company, at an ad journed meeting from that mentioned in last report, have resolved to continue their sinking to an additional 100 feet, and I trust that success may attend them under proper direc tion and management, as the fate of deep sinking on Boxing Reef depends much on it. The Steiglitz Company have sunk their main shaft an additional 25 feet. The vein in their ground has been very fluctuating, both in size and quality. It has, at their lowest depth, again pinched off and formed itself into a small vein of mica schist and iron pyrites, a specimen During the past month mining operations on this field have been progressing steadily, and give indications and guarantee of good ultimate results.

It has been found that where this occurs the vein will be good in its proximity ; in fact I have seen it in many cases on this field. I hope they will be induced to continue sinking deeper. the discharge plates, and here a considerable quantity of gold is retained. From this the tailings are conveyed on to a wooden shoot, 6 feet long, lined with zinc and having but just sufficient fall to carry off the tailings: about an inch deep of tailings remains in this shoot, and here the fine gold is mostly retained, After leaving the shoot, the tailings, &c, are, by means of a stop at the end of the shoot, thrown on to and passed through about 1 cwt of mer cury, contained in a pan of 2 feet diameter, 6 inches in depth and having rakes or agitators that keep the tailings from settling, and having a tendency to deposit the heaviest particles in the centre. After this, as a save-all. the tail ings pass into a second and similar pan, con nected to the first pan by a cast iron shoot, 18 inches in length and having a fall of about 1\u00a3 inch to the foot. At the conclusion of the crushing, the whole of the tailings, gold, &c, contained in the shoots, box, &c., is collected and carefully amalgamated in one of Berdan's machines In the above process the greatest care is taken in the regulation of the water, and as little is used as possible. A good deal de pends, of course, upon the quality of the quaitz operated upon. It is, in my opinion, the most perfect, least expensive and simplest plan of crushing and amalgamating I have ever seen. I am induced to make these lengthy remarks, having seen so many failures in other pro cesses and reading weekly the numerous appli cations for patents for ' ' improvements\" (sic) in gold crushing and amalgamating \u2014 in the outset complications on complications and in the end failures \u2014 great theoretical ideas and no prac tical knowledge \u2014 copies or piracies of machines used in other countries and for other purposes; in fact I am induced to the belief that the first miners who used a pick and shovel in Victoria should have taken out a patent for the same. I consider this process of such importance, es pecially to claimholders crushing their own quartz, that I will next month furnish you with drawings of it. I am happy to state the Gibraltar Company have completed the erection of their machinery, &c, and are now busily engaged in fixing their pumps, pipes, &c. The Redan Company are not yet working their ground, but are engaged in having the mullock, &c., from the old workings crushed ; it pays well, I believe. The New Chum Company, adjoining the above, are also not working their ground, but are employed in crushing the mullock from the Redan claim and their own ground. The Morning Star Company have completed the erection of their crushing machinery, which seems to be satisfactory; they will shortly com mence crushing the large quantities of quartz raised from their ground and the mullock raised by the original holders, the Allies Company. The. Albion Company are constantly en gaged in crushing quartz raised from their claim. I am unable to state definitely the quantity crushed and the yield therefrom, but I am credibly informed that the last crushing yielded 1 5 oz. per ton. The Norfolk Company's lease has been for warded to the warden's office for signature and execution, but as yet there are no apparent indications of intention to commence operations. The Cosmopolite will commence as soon as lease is executed. Private and Co-operative Companies. \u2014 The Ironbark Reef Company are busily at work, but as yet have not sufficient quartz raised for a crushing. The Birmingham Reef Prospect Claim are working with their usual energy and persever ance ; they have raised about 15 tons of quartz and intend sinking their shaft deeper, as the vein seems to improve in its depth. They ex pect from four to five ounces per ton from the lot raised. The Eureka Reef Company have registered their claim for a month. The late crushing did not realize what was expected, as a large quantity of slate adjoining the vein was crashed as well. The vein is thin and the ground very hard, still they have faith in it at a greater depth. The Malakhoff Company have had no crash ing since my last report, but are working their ground steadily. The quartz from the Wellington Reef is being crushed at the Blackwood machine, and not yet completed. About 70 tons are being operated on and they expect at least 2 oz, per ton. The New Year's Reef Prospect Claim at the last crushing yielded 5 oz. per ton. No. 1 Eolith are at present sinking their main shaft where the quartz still looks well. In alluvial mining, matters are compara tively quiet on Steiglitz, but those engaged in it can obtain from 1 to 2 dwts. per tub. The gullies where these deposits are found are gene rally short, and can only employ a limited number of men.

In consequence of the heavy rains and high floods which have prevailed here through the month, there has been comparatively but little work done either in quartz or alluvial mining. Most of the quartz mines have been stopped through excess of water percolating from the surface in such quantities as completely to master the power of the machinery employed to drain it, and great loss of time and capital has been the result, but happily better prospects appear to be now in view from the improved state of the weather, and the miners with but one or two exceptions are again at work. power, and there appears to be nothing want ing to do this but effective machinery. Appleton Brothers' Mine, being on a high level, has not suffered much from water, hut they have crashed only a small quantity during this month, having been engaged in sinking deeper, and effecting some repairs. The Cornish Company have also escaped from any serious injury from water, being likewise on a high level. This mine has been regularly at work during the month, and their water-w-heel having been well supplied with water, their crushing has been almost regularly at work. The Lerderderg Company's shaft is close to the side of the River Lerderderg, during the flood a great quantity of water permeated through the rock, and filled the shaft to the level of the river or nearly so. The unavoid able consequence was a suspension of opera tions for a time, but they are now at work again. U illiams and Company, whose lease joins that of the Lerderderg on the north, and on the right bank of the river, have suffered no thing from excess of water. They have only just commenced crashing for the first time. The Simmons' Reef Quartz Mining Com pany have been delayed through making some additions to the machinery, but their mine, from being on a high level, has escaped from injury by water. The Caledonian Company on Johnson's Reef, have not like some others been delayed by water but are sinking their shaft. They have had no crushings during this month. Hewson and Company have avoided the ill effects of the late heavy rains, by having wisely provided themselves with a tunnel to Great losses have been sustained by alluvial sluicers along the course of the River Ler derderg, for a distance of some 14 or 15 miles, by the floods having carried away their tools, sluice-boxes, &c, and also by inundating their claims, which cannot be re-established without much expense of time and money. These un fortunate occurrences, but too frequent in hilly districts like this, must necessarily for a time sensibly affect the yield of gold by diminish ing the quantity. Simmons' Reef \u2014 The Imperial Company's works being on rather a low level, and close to the side of a stream called the Back Creek, which was much swollen during the rain, have suffered much from surface water, the more so from the want of steam power and pumping gear to unwater the mine. Their only means at present being tubs drawn up the shaft by a horse whim. The mine is productive, and may be made very profitable if worked with proper Name of Company.

Their machinery is good and well constructed, but deficient in power. Trewhella Brothers \u2014 This claim is situated between two others, namely : the Pioneer Company's lease, and the United Company's lease, both of which being sunk to a deeper level than Trewhella Brothers' mine naturally drain it, so that the operations on the latter depend in a great measure upon the operations of the two mines lying respectively to the north and south of it.

The mine however is deserving the attention of capital ists, and may be made productive. Alluvial diggings are reviving after the effect of the recent floods, but a great deal remains to be done before this class of digging resumes its lost position. The ample supply without the excess of water, will, I think, restore matters in this respect to their former level, and at least, if not to some extent exceed it.

After the wet month of June and the first part of July we have had a fine spell of splen did weather for working combined with an abundant supply of water. The sluicing ope rations have consequently been carried on most briskly and generally satisfactorily. The opening up of expensive tail races and the extending, lengthening, and deepening of those already made is being carried on with great vigor. At Napoleon Flat sluicing claims are paying well. At the El Dorado, Kneebone's party are still driving preparatory to their blocking out, and consequently are just making wages, say \u00a34 per week. On the Two-mile some Chinese have fol lowed the example of the Europeans in opening up a long deep tail race in ground opened up and slovenly wrought some three years back. upon which they are doing well. On Penny weight Flat there is great activity amongst the Chinese and Europeans, also on the Two and Three-rmle. McEvoy's claim is barely payable although it is quite possible and probable that it may turn out yet a rich claim. Kenyon's claim has suspended work at present. Wellington's party have driven 30 feet into the bank from their last shaft and have struck boulders, upon which they were swamped out but are at length beginning to get the water under, these boulders are supposed to be the edge of the old bed of the creek and in which a good lead may yet be struck. At Bowman's Forest, Paddy's Gully, the German and California Leads are comparatively deserted ; on the Perseverance Lead they are getting on the average good wages. At Reid's Creek the miners are working steadily; the great Excelsior race (tail) is being still extended by blasting through tough granite 15 feet deep. The engine of the German and Durham quartz crashing company at the Two-mile has arrived and is being put up. this company will enable the miners to thoroughly prospect the numerous reefs that are running through the surrounding ranges.

The following information has been obtained relative to the quantity of Quartz crushed during the month, and the Gold obtained therefrom : \u2014 There has been a considerable influx of Chinese population since my last report, most of whom are located on the Buckland and Upper Ovens. One prospector's claim on a new view called the Moonlight has been registered, which is situated near the Duke of Northumberland Reef, but at present very little gold has been seen in it. Murray's Reef, on the Buckland is now likely to become of some importance. The prospector's claim, the only one occupied, shows gold well throughout most of the quartz and as soon as possible a sample will be crushed at Morse's Creek. There is no change to report in alluvial mining in this portion of the division. The rains have continued without any intermission until within the last week or ten days, conse quently all the wet flat and creek claims are entirely flooded out ; claims on the higher ground have in most instances continued to pay wages. On the old reefs on the Buckland nothing is doing at present, but Messrs. Tracy and Com pany are still prospecting on the Nelson Reef. It will be observed that the tabular return of quartz crushed shows a great decrease in quan tity for the past month. This is in consequence of the state of the roads, which iu many places have been completely inundated so that it has been impossible to cart quartz to the mills. The weather being now dry and frosty, large quantities of stone which have been raised during the last two months will be crushed, should the improvement in the weather continue. There have been trial crushings during the last month from the Misery and Harrietvale Reefs, but I have not yet been able to obtain any return of the quantity or yield. The Home Reef continues to yield well and there are now four good claims on this reef and two others being prospected with every probability of success.

In this shaft they have, within the last few days, struck a second reef in which gold is visible, but as yet no quantity of stone has been raised from it. which were driven to strike the reef ; as it was at first supposed by Messrs Gamble and Com pany that the reef would form in a N.W. SE. direction, the main tunnel was driven in the course which appears on the plan. In the tunnel they have struck several quartz veins but none of them appear to be auriferous \u2014 I am of opinion that they have still some sixty feet to drive. The old workings, with the exception of the shaft, do not extend on the western end to a greater depth than 30 feet, as the reef strikes perpendicularly from G. Messrs. Cotsworth and Wood have lately purchased Gilchell and Company's tramway, leading from the Oriental Reef, which they are going to extend to their mill, so that the expense and delay of having to cart the quartz nearly a quarter of^a mile will be avoided. The original company worked from the underlay shaft a small view underlaying the main body of quartz which is left standing on timber, as shown in plans 2 and 3. The outcrop and general bearings of the first or surface reef is 60\u00b0 from point B, which bearing is similar to that at the bottom of the old underlay shaft ; thus the reef forms a horseshoe bend on the surface of the old work ings, and at the greater depth preserves the same bearing as the outcrop. Messrs. Brown and Cotsworth, No. 1 South, are continuing to raise large quantities of good payable quartz, and this claim continues its character of keeping up the steadiest yield of any in the district. The first payable quartz was struck at the head of the cross cut and in No. 1 shaft, which is an underlay shaft on the course of the reef ; the reef only requires props and cap pieces in timbering, the rock formation being very sound. From No. 1 North, Messrs. Wallace and Company, continue to raise small quantities of payable quartz from a continuation of the surface workings. As soon as the reef is defined in the deep workings of Messrs. Cotsworth and Wood's claim, I will forward sections in completion of the plans of the Oriental Reef. Shaft No. 2 is a vertical shaft sunk into the reef to wind up quartz, and for ventilation. McNulty's Reef. \u2014 The prospecting party have had another payable crushing, and the reef in their claim continues to look well. Shaft No. 3 is an air shaft sunk on to the old workings, as shown in section H H, shows the outcrop and position in the tunnel of a reef running N.W.S.E. which is probably a continuation of Butchart's Reef (adjacent); no gold has been seen in the quartz where it has been intersected by the tunnel, but gold has been obtained as much as 1 dwt. to the dish in the casing. Messrs. Gamble and Company are now driving a tunnel at a lower level than shown on these plans in order to test this reef. The Pioneer Reef Company continue to raise good quartz from their reef, which is between four and five feet in thickness, and which they expect to prove payable throughout. Messrs. Wallace and Company are about to erect a water-power machine at this reef, and as motive power of this description is attended with little expense, there can be no doubt that they will be well remunerated for the under taking. Plan No. 2 is a longitudinal section of a portion of the claim, showing the old and new workings, with the timbering of the ground. As I have been unable to forward the gene ral survey of the division this month, I beg leave to send detail plans of the workings on the Pioneer Reef, showing the old workings and those in which a payable reef has been struck. Plan No. 3 shows two cross sections : No. 1 of the old workings, and No. 2 of that portion of the claim now worked. Referring to the latter, A B shows the dip or inclination of the old or surface reef, which runs out to a wedge at F ; the payable vein, which is now being worked, forms under the other at C; D and E are a front and back vein, all of which unite with the main body at the point where the first reef runs out. Plan No. 1 shows the relative position of the old and new workings ; the line A B shows the course of the reef now working and also the position of the claim which is marked off in this course, the line A B forming the centre ; line C D shows the course of the main tunnel and E and F cross cuts or short branch tunnels"], [286, "266 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 JULY. I trust, that on the ensuing month, I shall be able to give a much more detailed report of the state of quartz mining in my division, and I will make every endeavor to forward the general survey of the division. The best quartz yet raised came from the level where all the veins meet ; the whole of the quartz is auriferous, but at present only the centre body of quartz is sufficiently pay able.

Benalla. \u2014 There are alluvial workings within three miles of Benalla, at a depth of 120 feet, but the prospect is not very good. Several claims have been abandoned, and the only one now working is the prospecting claim. There are several quartz reefs, which promise well ; they are situated about three miles west of Benalla. on Gaffney's Creek. A considerable quantity of gold is procured here, and there is every indication of an extremely rich field being in this neighborhood. At present, the extreme severity of the weather (the country in many places being covered with snow) and the great difficulty of access, keep back numbers until finer weather, when a large rash may be ex pected. All the head waters of the Goulburn in this district appear to be auriferous. The country is unsurveyed, and its rugged and difficult nature will render it a work of time and expense to have it done properly.

They are about erecting a crashing machine for themselves, having a body of stone ten feet thick\u2014 the eastern por tion of the present reef \u2014 and passing along the whole length of the claim. The Union Company, to the south, are taking out and crushing, from the same stone as Moon and Company, 150 tons per week : their gold is never exhibited, nor their yield published ; but I am inclined to believe it is doing the best of any claim on Sandhurst. Wills, to the south of this, is not deep enough ; the water cuts him off at present, the stone dipping sharply to the south, which in his claim would be at least 1 00 feet under the water. He is about to erect a pumping engine, so that shortly, he, as well as many others, may expect the same stone, which will make this line rank as a leading reef. Bird's Reef, Kangaroo Gully. \u2014 This line is about to realize my anticipations ; there are four claims now upon it, raising first-class stone. The West Bendigo Company (Le Cape lain) are raising stone, from 1 to 3 oz. to the ton, to the south of their engine, opposite to which it crops out on surface, dipping sharply to the south, and being a flat spur of a good thickness, and in places, I am told, 30 feet wide ; it is wrought on tribute by two parties, and is realizing handsomely for all. The Bird's Reef Company have, after per severing under difficulties, just struck the reef which has been so remunerative to Moore, Elliot and Company, to the north. Some tons were crushed, which realized upwards of 8 oz. per ton. The stone has not been much opened ont yet, so that its character is not yet known this line is rapidly retrieving its former good character.

The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 15s. to \u00a33 16s. 6d. per oz. The late floods, as may be expected, broke down a few of the puddling dams on Kangaroo and Bendigo Flats, thereby creating to those concerned unavoidable delay and expense in reconstruction. Alluvial mining is still being vigorously carried on in my division, and there are seemingly as many miners employed thereon^ps ever there w%fe from the first. With many of the gullies and flats in this division, I am sorry to say, this must necessarily be the last time of going over them, as the puddlers (taking advantage of the times) are carrying the whole of the alluvial before them, from the surface to the bed rock, and passing the whole through their mills, by which method it is found just payable. Quartz reefing is much as it was last month, excepting that there is more bona fide work being done ; by the relief which has been afforded the miners, through the temporary amalgamation clause in No. 4 bye-laws, each individual claim is not now, as before, obliged to go to work under pain of forfeiture, whether there is a prospect or not, and creating thereby, in many instances, a permanent debt.

In the alluvial portions of the division, I am happy to say that I can fully confirm my report of last month, that the increased areas of claims and the facilities afforded to miners have infused great vigor into every branch of alluvial mining. It is now I think quite pos sible, since so many whims for baling have been and are being erected on the wet leads, to keep them free from water, especially if the miners can be brought to work in concert, and it is very likely that the whole of the aban- Chinese.

This ground had been prospected by the now fortunate owners, as they supposed, in every direction ; they had worked at it for about three years and found nothing. Two other reefs have lately been opened in the Whipstick Scrub, but they are scarcely payable. It is unfortunate for the Whipstick portion of the division that water is so very scarce, and from what I know of the locality I am appre hensive that little can be done to improve it ; the nature of the ground is undulating so that no extent of ground that I have seen has a decided watershed in the area of which much water might be collected; nevertheless, as the Whipstick is very extensive, such a place may as yet have escaped my notice, though I have visited a large portion of it. I shall, however, not desist in the search, as I am very anxious to promote mining in that locality, and I am certain that in it both alluvial and quartz gold is yet abundant. Kilmore Division. (H.

Some uncertainty ex isted as to which district these workings were in, the extremely ragged nature of the country rendering it difficult to ascertain on which side of the Dividing Range these creeks were on. They have now been traced into the Muddy Creek.

No rock is visible, but the probability is that it is clay slate, and from the quanity of quartz found, there is every likeli hood of reefs being discovered.

In Grim shaw's prospecting claim on No. 2 Creek, four men washed, on an average, 7 oz. of gold per day, and all the other claims hold out a good premium. The extreme severity of the weather combined with the difficulty of access, prevent many from staying there at present.

I have been unable as yet to obtain a com plete account of the quartz crushed or the yields obtained from the reefs in the neigh borhood of Whroo, but I hope to be able to do so for my next report. able in Melbourne. The cost of raising is 7s. 6d. per ton, and the prospectors turn out weekly from their claim from 70 to 80 tons. I am not aware whether any analysis has been made to determine the exact proportion of the different metals, but the high specific gravity of the ore sufficiently indicates 'its value. The number of quartz prospecting claims taken up during the last three months in the two divisions is [?] One half the reefs that have been abandoned would pay well could the quartz be raised for 10s. per ton. Five tons crushed from a new reef, 2 feet in thickness, struck at Long Gully, near Redcastle, yielded 3 dwt. to the ton \u2014 abandoned. Bryant and Co.'s new reef, Staf fordshire Flat, opened a fortnight back, 1 ton crushed yielded 5 dwt. to the ton; would keep a powerful engine going ; could be bought for \u00a320. The reef is 3 feet thick. About a mile and a half to the south of Coster and Field's prospecting claim, reefs have been found cropping out so wide apart as to indicate the existence of extensive mines of antimony; indeed, two, if not three distinct lodes have been already struck in this locality, and, in all, gold in remunerative quantities has been obtained. That portion of the ore with which quartz is mixed, is separated from the solid antimony and carted to Redcastle, a distance of seven miles, to be crushed. The cost of cartage is 18s. and crushing 16s. per ton, which, together with the expence of raising, makes an aggre gate cost of \u00a32 Is. 6d. per ton. An improved system of mining, and the employment of machinery, would add considerably to the revenue of the shareholders. Within the last few months mining opera tions have received a fresh impulse from the discovery of many auriferous quartz reefs. In Heathcote and its immediate vicinity, two have been struck ; one between the Argyle and Caledonian Gullies, about two miles from the township, and the other at Slaughter yard Hill, Wattle Flat, within the municipal boundary. There are 150 persons engaged in mining there. The locality has been named Coster field, in honor of the discoverers. I trust to be able in connexion with my next report to furnish you with a plan of that portion of this division, showing the physical features of the country, its geological structure, and the nature and working of the mine. No stone from either has yet been crashed, so as to give an idea of the probable yield, but from the specimens shown me by Messrs. N orris and Parkin, the discoverers, it would appear that good returns may be anticipated. Parkin's Reef, at Slaughter-yard Hill, is 4 feet thick, and its course is nearly east and west. A good many claims have been taken up on it. The Caledonian Mclvor Company are now engaged in deepening their shaft. The present depth is 225 feet, but it is intended to sink to 250 feet, when a drive will be put in and the reef it is supposed, cut in about 80 feet. The thickness of the reef is from 3 to 4 feet, and the last 800 tons crushed yielded an average of i\\ oz. to the ton. About nine miles from Heathcote, and about seven miles from Redcastle, an antimony lode has been discovered, and from the results obtained by the prospectors, Messrs. Coster aud Field, a considerable rash has taken place, and claims have been marked off for an extent of three and a half miles. The company have completed the erection of their new machinery, which is in splendid con dition and in thorough working order. The value of the plant alone is \u00a3 15,000. It is their intention eventually to sink the shaft to a depth of 600 feet. The antimony hitherto discovered has been found in nearly horizontal strata, having an inclination to the meridian of about 7\u00b0. In some places it crops out on the surface in the form of a grey stone which, when broken, ex hibits a metallic appearance, (j enerally , how ever, the antimony is covered with a capping of quartz, varying in thickness from nine inches to two feet six iuches, and in width from three feet to seven feet. On Nortis's Reef, Caledonian Gully, the claims have been averaging 4 oz. to the ton. In consequence of the attention at present paid to quartz reefing, but few parties now attempt to prospect for new alluvial workings. I have, therefore, little to report relative to this branch of mining adventure, further than that a new lead was struck some four weeks ago, by Moody and party, at Hard Hill near Speed's road, about four and a half miles from Heath cote. The sinking was between 7 and 8 feet, through very hard ground. The wash-dirt was The yield from this capping averages 2\u00a3 oz. to the ton ; but lately the prospectors have obtained as high as 6J oz. to the ton.

Mr. Lewis is about to erect additional ma chinery on his claim on the Albert Keef, Balac lava Hill. This claim is still in full work, and as productive as ever. It has already yielded \u00a3 1 30,000 to its fortunate possessors, and shows every prospect of continuing equally productive for many years. The Redcastle Reefs still maintain their ancient renown, while new discoveries almost daily prove the highly auriferous character of this portion of the division. The claims of Sullivan and party, Cope and party, Nicholas and party, on the Victoria Reef, Curly Dog Gully ; Clarke and party, Franotovich and party, on the Sclavonian Keef; and the Native Cat Claim, Bellevue Reef, Staffordshire Flat ; have produced for the last month an average of 4^ oz. 13\u00a3 dwts. to the ton ; whilst the monthly returns of ten claims in the vicinity of Redcastle, have averaged 1 oz. 13J dwts. to the ton. In conclusion, I beg to offer some remarks on the auriferous nature of the Heathcote and Waranga divisions, and the manner in which mining operations are conducted. A glance at the country lying between Heath cote and the Goulburn shows an extent of un tried ground, perfectly netted with auriferous quartz reefs, cropping out in every direction, and gullies abounding in indications of rich alluvial deposit. Of the newly opened reefs it is impossible to speak with any degree of certainty, but even with the rude appliances here in vogue, there is every reason to think they will prove remu nerative. The results obtained from those already opened, leave no doubt of the remunerative character of those yet unworked. Population and machinery alone are needed, to raise the Heathcote and Waranga divisions into promi nence and importance. Thirty tons of stone taken from a new reef called the Emeu Reef, about a mile and a half from Redcastle, yielded 3 oz. to the ton. A trial crushing from several lately opened reefs showed an average of 1 7 5 dwt. to the ton ; but this can hardly be considered a fair sample, as the quartz crushed was taken from the surface, and could not, therefore, be considened a fair criterion of what, by exploration, the several reefs might turn out, That section of the mining population, who at Ballaarat, and the other large gold fields, eke out but a precarious subsistence, would here, by industry and the application of that mining experience acquired by many years of hard toil on such workings as the deep rock leads of Ballaarat, soon be enabled to acquire a comfortable competency. At Rushworth, antimony has been dis covered, but as it has not been sufficiently worked, no estimate can be formed of its value. The quartz reefs there are retaining their char acter for richness, and new ones are being con stantly discovered. With the introduction of machinery, and an improved method of mining, a rich future may be anticipated for this portion of the division. Nothing can be more rude and primitive than the system of mining pursued in these divisions. The old wooden handled windlass supported by four crossed sticks, is in general use. These windlasses are placed in a row, over shafts sunk about 30 feet apart, the shafts almost in variably following the underlie of the reef ; the whole of the quartz being progressively re moved, and the ground being secured by tim bering of the rudest description. The removal of the quartz is effected by means of oil-drums, sliding on skids consisting of saplings, barked and trimmed, the space left by the removal of the reef being all that is available for the miner to work in. The Goulburn Diggings offer considerable allurements to the alluvial miner. The sinking is easy, and no capital is required. A con siderable number of persons are here located, the place maintaining its name as the poor man's diggings. At Whroo, quartz mining progresses favor ably. 130 tons of quartz from Messrs. Jones and Company's claim, Albert Reef, have been crushed, and yielded 8 oz. to the ton. Band and Company's claim has been registered on account of water The last 14 tons crushed returned 7 cz. The machinery of Stanton and Moore's late claim is expected shortly to be on the ground. No idea seems to be entertained that one vertical shaft, with galleries and tramways, would afford increased facility for working, and effect a greater saving of time and labor than is possible under the present system. Generally speaking, no reefs, unless pro ducing from 1 oz. to 1J oz. per ton, are con sidered payable. The cause of this is to be found, not only in the defective system of mining employed, but also in the strength of the mines being frittered away in detailed Some 30 tons of quartz from Carr's Reef yielded 68 oz. 15 dwt of gold. From the Frenchman's Reef, on Balaclava, 11 tons of stone yielded 12J oz.

Ths charge per ton for crushing cement is from 9s. to 1 2s. I have the honor to inform you that in alluvial mining two important discoveries have been made during the month. The principal one or at least the one which up to the present has attracted the largest population has been made in an extensive flat which junctions with the Mia Mia Flat and known as the Liverpool Rush. The prospectors bottomed at a depth of 12 feet and obtained 4 dwt to the tub, since then other parties have been realizing as high as 1 oz to the tub the average however of the claims obtaining payable gold may be taken as 1 oz. per load. The lead is from 10 to 80 feet in width, and in some places gold is found diffused over a wider area, but not in such re munerative quantities as where it is more con fined. The depth of wash-dirt varies from 6 to 18 inches. Over two miles of auriferous ground has already been opened up The population at present numbers about 2,800. Nos. 1 and 2 amalgamated, on the F'rontage Lead, which has been recently proclaimed here, have attained a depth of 125 feet and no appearance of bottom. They had 90 feet of rock, but the principal of it was a soft honey comb and was gone through with the pick, at 1 1 0 feet they struck water, and 8 men con stantly at work find it difficult to make much progress in sinking. On the Scandinavian and Rocky Flat Leads no particular change has taken place in mi.ing matters during the month. The Reservoir Rush is daily becoming more depopulated, a large proportion of the miners has removed to the Liverpool and Mount Greenock Hushes where the chances of success are more favorable. Those remaining, num bering about 400. are engaged in working the ground that was abandoned. The other discovery, which I think will be of a more permanent nature than the first men tioned, has been made in the vicinity of Mount Greenock. In quartz mining an unprecedented dullness prevails, but few crushings have taken place this month and generally the yield has been poor. The drawback to the development of the lodes is in a great measure owing to the distance the stone has to be carted There are many reefs in the district which would yield 8 dwt. aud 10 dwt to the ton, but not being in the vicinity of crushing machinery are abandoned.

In one case several large kilns of quartz, about 2,000 tons, is expected, from several trials, to yield from J oz. to 14 dwts. to the ton. The mining population remains about the same as it was last month, although a good many quartz miners have been attracted to Long Gully.

The sinking is hard throughout, width of payable ground not yet ascertained, but from shafts bottomed on the prospecting claim the probable width in that claim will be over 100 feet. into the bed rock, forming a bar or dyke on one side of which the reef extends and on the other a distance of from one to two chains, the alluvial deposit is found. The origin of this isolated ironstone forma tion is a query yet to be solved. In the general sketch, as also in the enlarged horizontal section. I have shown the position of the Bristol Keef now being worked, with that of the main lode of the Bakery Hi 1. The Bristol Keef first struck at the depth of 60 feet in McMahon's claim. I have shown more distinctly in plan 2 as also its continuation both north and south in the claims of Jewitt and Company, and O'Neill and Company ; in no other claim has this reef been yet discovered, although in several quartz has been met with, which I imagine to be leaders, from the Bakery Hill Reef or main lode. About six miles on the road from Rostron's to Peter's stations, payable gold has also been found: depth of sinking 10 feet, prospect 1 dwt. to the tub, with 1 foot wash-dirt. Gold coarse. Close to the above another prospecting claim has been applied for, shallow sinking, prospect 1 dwt. to the tub, wash-dirt 18 inches thick. At Peter's old diggings, and about quarter of a mile south of McLean's store, the old lead has been discovered at a depth of 28 feet : the same hard sinking which characterises all this line of hills ; washdirt 4 inches thick, gold mixed, being both coarse and fine and of good quality ; prospect 5 dwts from 6 buckets. Several applications have been made for prospect claims on several reefs, but with the exception of that of the Lancashire Reef, no payable prosp et has been obtained. This reef, situate about 2^ miles east of Sanderson's Station, has been opened but two days, so that as yet no reliable information can be given, although from the appearance of the stone I should say it would eventually prove paj-able. '1 he St. Arnaud United Company are about to commence work. I am informed a pre liminary trial of machinery has been made, and the first start was beautifully easy. Of the Sebastopol Company I have nothing to report. In McMahon's claim, No. 1, plan 2, at the depth of 65 feet, their drive crosses a small vein of gold-bearing quartz, and immediately after cuts through a crevice in the rock, filled with disintegrated quartz of an entirely different quality to that composing the reef, small pieces of water-worn ironstone, soft soapy clay, and broken slate. The same fissure or crevice was cut through in the shaft, at the depth of 30 feet, taking a more inclined direction than the underlay of the reef. In the alluvial gully, in strata 2 and 3, is the same kind of tack as that found in the fissure in drive. In Jewitt's claim this reef also struck at the depth of 60 feet, is more compact and defined, being between 5 and 6 feet thick, and contain ing more gold The fact of this reef being struck at the same depth in Jewitt's claim as in McMahon's-, shows that its dip northerly must be very gradual indeed. The distance between the two claims, as shown on plan 1, being considerable. In McMahon's claim the eastern side of the reef has not yet been attained, which will account for that portion of the reef not being so remu nerative as that of Jewitt's, for i as will be seen on reference to plan 2, No. 2 enlarged section, marked bb) the only places in the reef from which payable gold is obtained, are two streaks of fine grained quartz, one running through the centre of the reef and the other composing its eastern face, varying from 8 to 1 4 inches thick, and if crashed separately, I do not hesitate in saying, would yield 14 or 15 oz p r ton. At present they are crushing the whole of the reef, which I am informed, yields from 2 to 3 oz. per ton. Messrs. Edgar, Grierson and Company have thus far progressed favorably, their bitumized paper piping answering admirably, so much so that the St. Arnaud United have adopted it where prafcticable ; they have at last cleared all the old workings of water, and will soon break into the reef, when some further infor mation, it is hoped, may be obtained. By the mail I have forw.irded plans and sections of that portion of the St. Arnaud division, near and containing the Bakery Hill, and Bristol Reefs, as also that of Cook's and Shewring's Reefs, and a portion of the old alluvial workings of New Bendigo the connec tion of which and the Bristol Keef with St Arnaud will be fouud on tracing forwarded last month. On reference to plan No. 1 in general sketch on the eastern side of small hill on which Cook's Reef is situate will be seen marked, auriferous deposit ; and on the southern por tion of the eastern slope, of the same hill, and close to the auriferous deposit, is marked, ironstone. To the south of McMahon's claim and in that of O'Neill and Company, this reef rises to the surface, and has been worked, as will be seen on res rence to plan 2, No 3. In this claim the reef is not so thick or so well defined, as in that of either ot the others, a number of thiek leaders, marked bb, ton- This ironstone formation extends along the south-eastern portion of this hill, from the surface to a depth varying from 5 to 30 feet"], [302, "282 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 JULY. stantly coming in from the east and displacing it. The amalgamating process is by blankets, after sundry falls and catches. It is intended to change the blankets every hour, when they will be thoroughly cleaned of all tailings, gold, &c, in a tub, the contents of which will be then emptied into a revolving barrel (containing mercury), affixed by shaft to engine, after many thousand revolutions of which, instead of allow ing the refuse tailings to flow away, they will then pass over a shaking table of two compart ments from thence to a plunge of two feet deep into mercury, rising of themselves over a catch four inches high, and immediately fall again into another mercurial trough, at the depth of two feet from the four inch rise ; rising agaiu they will be allowed to flow away. The stamps will be constantly fed with warn water, for which purpose a steam ch.st with feeding pipes is provided. The stamps feed themselves, the quartz being brought directly from the mouth of the shaft to the hopper. From the stamp bed of machine to shaft mouth is a natural elevation of twenty three feet, so that the tram to top of hopper is worked with great facility. Attached to the engine is a pump with nearly 500 feet of piping, for the supply of water to machine from dam. The machine is situated on E. point of Wilson's Hill, and the dam in gully adjoining. From the latter a drive has been taken through the point of the hill to engine shaft, and paper pipes laid therein a distance of 450 feet, with flood gate or throttle valve at the dam end of piping and drive, so that at any time the both may be thoroughly pumped dry and inspected. The proprietors of this machine have now every opportunity of success, with splendid ma chinery, payable quartz, and plenty of it for years to come, a good dam, and in fact every thing that could be desired or needed\u2014 not ex cepting energetic and clever managers, so that from this company at least, something superior may be reasonably hoped for. A remarkable jump or fault has also occurred here, as will be seen on reference to sections, horizontal and transverse, No. 3. I hope to be able in my next to report result of trials between Chilian mill, blankets and shaking tables, now being carried on by Messrs. Mecredie, quartz crushers, who are sparing no pains to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion, being quite willing to adopt anything for the benefit of the miners in general. In my next I will also send description, with plans and section of Little Hill, containing ironstone dyke, and reef. The crushing plant of the St. Arnaud United Company, as a whole, is, I consider, one of the best in the colony. 1 he engine is a horizontal of 60 horse-power, and is, with several improvements not contem plated by the maker, put together in the best style ; one of which improvements is the con tinuing of the piston rod through the piston and the bottom of the cylinder, to prevent the wear aud tear on side of latter, to which every horizontal engine is liable, a new bottom pro vided with stuffing box, &c , having been put in for that purpose. The boilers, of which there are two, 30 feet long by 6 feet in diameter, are those known as Cornish flues, for the supply of which, in cases of emergency, a separate engine is provided, a counterpart of the other, in minature, being of 1 horse-power. The crushing plant at present consists of battery of 1 2 stamps, shafting, gearing. &c , being complete for the working of three twelves; they are erected on nearly the same plan as those at the Port Phillip Company's Works at the Clunes, being provided with self-feeding hoppers, loose stamp-heads and beds, &c The whole of the framework, &c., is composed of cast iron, making all more compact, solid, and lasting.

The Fortnna and the Old Quartz Hill are in a more encouraging condition, each employing a good number of men and keeping their machinery constantly at work, and ea<h now realizing a balance over working expenses with every probability of improvement, in favor of each it may be stated they consist of few shareholders, and possess very efficient ma chinery. In puddling operations this division is im proving and receiving an accession to this class of miners from neighboring divisions ; the frequent good finds, and the generally payable character of our old workings, when worked on the wholesale system, giving much encouragement to the industrious miuer. The returns from claims formerly held by public companies are very materially improv iug : the Ajax, formerly the Bolivia Company, having realized 532 oz. 4 dwts from 260 tons, and the Undaunted formerly the Cumberland, 122 oz. 3 dwt. from 243 tons \u2014 both during the past month.

The gold however is of a coarse nuggety character and well washed, a fact likely to give encourage ment to the persevering miner, as it may De naturally inferred that where the gold is coarse and well washed, more is lodged in the vicinity.

There is nothing new to report in tunnelling operations, so steadily, and with so few fluctu ations is this branch of mining carried on that there is absolutely nothing new in connection with the subject. The tunnellers are so situated that neither wet or dry weather affects their working. Some times in the summer season they are obliged to stack their washing-stuff from the want of water, but never obliged to cease working their tunnels. heavy washed boulders, &e, and in some places small specks of gold may be picked up. Although I believe this part of the country will never be very rich, there is still undoubt edly room for hundreds of miners to earn a livelihood for some considerable time. At Pyke's Hill, the few parties who are working are making good wages. The ground is not rich, but there is a good thickness of washing stuff, and in this case quantity makes up for quality. The prospecting tunnel in Heron's Hill, struck the auriferous drift last week, and although they have not sufficient gold to remu nerate them for their labor, they are contented with their prospects. Another party has applied for a frontage claim on the same parallels. In the prospecting claim the wash-dirt is dipping very considerably towards the hill, a fact plainly proving the existence of deep ground, and probably very rich. Should gold in paying quantities be found, there is room on the hill for a hundred frontage claims. This hill has lately been surveyed for sale, but the land has not been advertise!. Many of the puddlers throughout the division have been flooded and have in consequence registered their claims. Quartz mining in the Fryer's Creek division is still at a discount. I have not a single dis covery to report. If the Ferron's Keef and El Dorado Companies resume operations, quartz mining will be a little brisker. The yields from the various reefs are very small, but as the parties consist of working men they manage to make a good living. The rush at Hard Hill, near Pickpocket (of which I spoke in my last), has not increased to any great extent, several of the holes are turning out fair wages. Mining at Pickpocket is at a perfect stand still, in consequence of the heavy floods having swamped the whole of the claims. Some few of these claims are been drained, while the owners of others have applied to the warden for protection for two months, in order to gain a little breathing time, and that the worst of the winter may be over previous to their recom mencing operations At Guildford, the Chinese have been flooded out two or three times within the month, they persevere however notwithstanding the impedi ments thrown in their way. The Chinese evi dently are, as a class, a most persevering set of men ; there appears to be no obstacle too great for them to surmount. It matters not how many times they may be flooded, they engage Mr. Scotson, who is working the ground lately occupied by the Alliance Company, in forms me that three pennyweights to the ton will pay him for mining quartz in shallow places. I have noticed during my residence in the Fryer's Creek district, that to the southward, the quartz reefs are either split into branches too small for mining, or lost altogether to view. I believe the fact to be that they dip deeper into the ground as they go in that direction ; in fact such must be the case, as no experienced miner believes that they die out or cease to exist. Certainly the experience of other countries favor the idea, that although they do not crop out on the surface, they exist at various depths, and will be worked only when mining in Victoria is reduced to a science.

Quartz mining has during the last month produced very little of general interest. In Jim Crow proper no actual new discoveries have taken place, but the favorable opinion generally entertained of that portion of the division between the heads of Sailors' Creek and Deep Creek has not been diminished, and a good few parties are prospecting about the ranges. excess of water and various other reasons, one of the most prominent perhaps is difficulty during the wet season, of access to crushing machinery. In some few cases perhaps, a cer tain want of energy might be complained of, but this is in a great measure attributable to the sudden southern strike of the reefs requiring a more than usual amount of capital and labor to develop the character of the reefs in question, and in a sluicing and puddling district like Jim Crow the miner soon becomes cautious how he invests his time and money in uncertain specu lations, as long as he, in alluvial mining, with less outlay of either, can reap even a moderate profit.

Beehive Reef, at Dry Diggings, is as usual looking first rate, and another claim has been taken up south of the original claim. Sportsman's Reef, in the same locality, is also looking up, the prospectors having lately come upon some quartz that looks very pro mising. On Parker's, Specimen Reef, the Dry Dig gings Company have now made arrangements with a party from Sandy Creek to furnish ma chinery, the removal and erection of which will at once be proceeded with. A great portion of the company's ground has settled down during the late rains, and it will take some time before the mine is in work able order. that the engine is about being removed. The reef has only been worked to depth of some 1 4 or 1 6 feet, and the average, as near as I can learn been about 6 dwt. per ton, by a width of reef of 12 feet and upwards. On Wombat Reef the Cornish party has been engaged removing the engine, lately pur chased from the Welcome Company, from Connell's Gully to Wombat Hill, and have not, yet completed the re-erection. The company is working at a depth of about 90 feet but have had no crushings during the month. From Messrs. Pitt and Company's claim, adjoining north, 4 tons have b-en crushed yielding 3J oz. The next claim, Messrs Grantfell and Com pany are still prospecting, gold has been got in several places, but it is not yet ascertained whether the reef on the whole is payable. On Collier's Reef, Messrs. Woodworth and Company, and Sampson and Company, are prospecting, os yet with no definite results, and Messrs. Brown and Company have tem porarily suspended operations to procure the aid of machinery. The Fearnought Company (Messrs. Addis and Company), mining under Camp-street, are eclipsing most of the quartz mining companies about Jim Crow. 250 tons of quartz having yielded at the rate of 2 J oz. per ton, and another lot is at present at the machine. On Gray's Reef, lately taken up by original discoverers, most of the month has been spent in clearing and timbering the shaft and drives and otherwise making the claim secure. The last quartz taken out before, averaged 17 dwt. per ton, and I expect the party will have a lot ready for crushing before my next report. The prospectors on Adelaide Reef have pur chased and refitted a mill worked by a water wheel on Sailor's Creek, but I am not aware whether they have commenced crushing. On this reef, situate near the head of Don't-wake'm In Yandoit, quartz mining has been unusu ally dull of late, some of the principal reefs having during the last month being entirely at a stand, but the terms of registrations in most instances expires within this month, and operations will then be resumed. On Old German Reef, the Goldsmiths' Quartz Mining Company has been engaged the best part of the month crushing, but I have not been able to learn the results. The company however has now got fairly to work, and from whit is known of part of the ground, may fairly be expected to add not inconsiderably to the weekly produce of this gold field. The Alpha Company, next south, is not yet in a position to resume operations, and have renewed their reservation of claim. On King Billy's Reef, a very promising lode is reported to have been struck at a consider able depth, about 30 feet west of the shaft, but so recently that nothing definite is known as yet. On Trogish Reef, the prospectors are getting a kiln ready for crushing, expected to average about 1 \\ oz. per ton, but the rest of the claims are registered. On Glamorganshire Reef seven oreight claims are at work, but only No. 1 and 2 North have got payable gold, and in both the character of the reef has hitherto proved very patchy, in fact so much so that no reliance can be placed on the generally exaggerated reports that now and again get abroad, although certainly I have seen the most splendid samples of stone on this reef Gully, three claims have now got the reef pay able, the average yield being about 3 oz. per ton by a thickness of quartz varying from \\ to 2 \\ feet. The next two claims are down to water, but have suspended work until the rest of the claims attain the same level. From Adams' new reef, near the head of Old Tom Gully, I have learned nothing of import ance. Claims No. 1, 2, and 3 South, have got the reef as good as ever, but are reserving then quartz for the engine intended to be removed thither from Melvin's Reef, and five or six claims further south are busy sinking. On New Nuggety Reef, Connell's Gully, matters remain every way satisfactory in the prospecting claim, and a new shaft has been started on the adjoining claim south. The Welcome Company's ground on Con nell's Reef, lately occupied by the Cornish Company of Wombat Hill, has been abandoned by that party, and the whole of that line is at The whole of Hamburg Reef is dormant, hut operations will be resumed on the whole line next week. Most of the claims, if not all, being down to water, it has been proposed to amalgamate and form all into one company the better to effect an efficient drainage, but the different claimholders have not yet come to a determination, each party naturally valuing their claims higher than their neighbours. This would, however, in my opinion be by far the most economical and at the same tune most effectual mode of testing the reef at a depth, and will probably become absolutely necessary present at a stand. in the ond."], [309, "MINING SUEVEYOES' REPOETS JULY. 289 \u25a0i The Great Reef Company's mine and plant has during the month been at a stand pending some re-organization of the company ; and on Pioneer Reef, the Pioneer Company have commenced sinking an engine shaft and erecting their machinery, pending the completion of which the quartz raised from the original workings are being stacked. With this exception nearly the whole of the reef is idle. in this branch of mining still remain to be made. In Italian or Hard Hill, Stony Creek Ridge, and Elevated Plains, a considerable number of miners are engaged, mostly in old ground, and judging from appearances I believe that most of them are doing extremely well. In Shep herd's Flat most ground available has been taken up, but I have not learnt that any of them have broken through, although some of them started eight or ten months ago. I am, however, persuaded that the Elevated Plains Lead passes through that ground, and that the parties will ultimately be amply rewarded for their labor. On New German Reef the prospecting claim was lately sold for \u00a31000. The purchasers, a Ballaarat firm, procured and erected convenient to the reef on Yandoit Creek a steam crushing machine, but the reef was found not payable, and consequently not only the prospecting claim but the whole of the reef was abandoned all in the space of about one month Alluvial sinking has not during the last month presented any new feature of interest. In the shallow old gullies about Jim Crow a few parties are still, either from inclination or necessity, or perhaps both combined, following the nomadic system of tub and cradle, princi pally allured by the occasional find of a more than ordinary sized nugget; but these instances are getting to be of rare occurrence, and under ordinary circumstances this kind of mining does hardly ensure a bare subsistence. The deep ground in Blanket Flat is still held in reserve, pending negociations for machinery being completed. The Township's Lead has not been traced any farther since my last report. The shaft in Mr. Kirwan's paddock is now being sunk on con tract, and has every appearance of being on deep ground, but the water greatly retards operations. The yield on the whole of the shafts bottomed, as far as I can ascertain, are brilliant as usual ; in one instance come to my knowledge, six men shared 35 oz. for the week's work, 'the Wombat Hill Company have let the sinking of a shaft on tender at \u00a33 10s. per foot, and are just commencing operations. Messrs. Spence and Company's tunnel, as well as Salmon and Company's, from Stan bridge-street towards Queensberry-street. are both fast progressing, the first named being soon expected to break through. The Shepherd's Flat Gold Mining Company have considered it advisable to sink a new shaft higher up the flat, and are engaged removing their engine in consequence. In Yandoit no perceptible change has taken place in alluvial mining as yet, but it is likely that some very good ground will be found in Shicer's Gully, east of Old Yandoit Hill. One shaft is reported to have bottomed at thirty odd feet, and obtained about 5 dwts. per tub, and several claims have been taken up in con sequence; but whether this will lead to any important discovery remains to be seen. The ground is very wet. and is supposed to have received the gold deposits from the abovemen tioned Old Yandoit Hill, and the appearance is very much in favor of such supposition. The Grand Junction Company is reported Besides the abovementioned reefs several others are being prospected, but no discovery worthy of remark has occurred during the month Puddling and Sluicing. \u2014 The heavy falls of rain during the last month have somewhat retarded mining operations, although with the present ample supply of water the loss of time will soon be made up for The detraction of the Hepburn Reservoir on the 14th July. through drifting timber accumulating in the bye-wash, caused a number of claims in the creek-bed and along the banks to be flooded, and also caused a very serious damage in the destruction of races, flumes, sluicing boxes, and burying tools, &c., but no lives were lost, such as at first was reported. However most of the consequences of the flood are got over, and the usual sameness in this branch of mining is predominant The only notable event in sluicing has been the cutting of a new race from the head of Sailors' Creek towards the heads of Old Tom Gully, German Gully, and vicinity, and some six or seven sluicing claims have been taken up in these gullies ill consequence I have heard of no instances of more than the ordinary average, which I as far as I can learn estimate at between \u00a32 and \u00a33 a man per week Tunnelling is as much in favor as ever, and deservedly so, both for the geneial regularity of yield and the length of time a claim of this description generally affords profitable employ ment. By for the greater portion of ground now occupied has for years been the busy scene of mining operations, and will probably remain so for years to come. That no new ground for a long time has been opened is a sure proof that no scarcity of ground is felt by the miners following this vocation, for a careful ex amination of the many basaltic hills and plains in this division will prove almost beyond a doubt that only a small portion of our mineral resources have been developed, and that perhaps some of the most important discoveries"], [310, "290 MINING SUEYEYOES' EEPOETS JULY. to have broken through the basaltic rock, and are at present sinking in a stratum of drift gravel. The Alpha Company's engine has been sold by auction, and is removing to another gold field, and the claim is also open for sale. The Ph\u0153nix Company, at the head of Forty Foot, have got their shaft down about 230 feet, and are at present sinking through a layer of shingles, but are very much troubled with water. This is the same shaft from which the fossils forwarded in February were obtained. In the beginning of July several nuggets, amongst which was one of 14 oz , were found in new ground, Stockyard Gully, Glengower, and a number of holes were bottomed in the neighborhood; but nothing of consequence was found, and the rush therefore suddenly subsided. Only about thirty or forty people are now living in the locality, and apparently making a comfortable living. Some patches of very good ground have, time after time, been worked, and a large tract of land shows every indica tion of being auriferous; but with the limited number of miners living in Glengower, isolated almost from the rest of Jim Crow and all other gold fields, prospecting, at least alluvial, is not carried to any great extent. Three or four quartz reefs are being prospected, as yet with no result, and as I purpose visiting Glengower during the present month I shall be able to report more at length in my next report.

Steeds, and Gibbins ; but there are twenty or more which have produced gold. Western Gold Field. \u2014 There has been some little excitement caused by further discovery of gold in the Government Survey Paddock ; about thirty men are busily engaged on the eastern slope of the bald hill, north of the Back Creek. It has long been suspected that there was gold under the trap-rock of which this hill is com posed, but the hard nature of the sinking has hitherto deterred miners, whose means were small, from hazarding the chances of remune ration. coarse and rough in appearance, showing indi cations of not having been much washed by removal from its original matrix, and the angular character of the stones in the drift would lead to the same inference. The Belltopper Reef. \u2014 Operations are likely to be carried on here with greater effort than hitherto. Mr. A. V. Dodge, who finally pur chased the steam engine and claim lately held by the Italians, is putting the works in more efficient order. Three claims are now being worked on this reef. The deepest shaft is 165 feet, and is on claim No. 2 south. At this depth the lode is only 8 inches thick, and inclines to the westward in the line of descent 12\u00b0 from the perpendicular. On the Humboldt Reef three claims are being worked ; but the prospector's are the only party getting gold. Malmsbury Gold Field. \u2014 At the French man's Reef, M. Guichard is excavating a new tunnel to reach the four acre plot which has lately been leased to him. The tunnel is being cut at the lowest level practicable, so as to avoid floods from the Kangaroo Creek, which runs between the mouth of the tunnel and the steam crushing machine. There is required 600 feet of tunnelling before they can reach the reef. Mr. Guichard says that the last crushing which he had, of 250 tons of quartz taken from the cap of the reef, only produced 2 dwt. of gold per ton, and that the yield has never been higher than 7 dwt. per ton. The reef is about 25 feet in thickness and inclines slightly to the westward in the line of descent. Gold is found At Yankee Point there are three parties tunnelling under the trap-rock formations ; two on the west side of the creek have rented two acres each from the proprietor of the land at an annual rental of \u00a310 per acre, and the third party (eight in number) have taken the whole area of the paddock which is on the east side of the creek, and comprises 43 acres, at a rental of \u00a360 per annum. The Liberty Flat Company, on their lease of 10 acres, have been greatly retarded in their operations by reason of the excessively wet weather. They have only obtained during the month 22 ozs 11 dwt. of gold. I beg leave to correct an error which I made in my last report, by misapprehension, with respect to the value of shares in this company. The shares were originally valued at \u00a320 each, last month one changed hands at \u00a375. At Scorpion Hill the two tunnelling parties are doing satisfactorily. Messrs. Conlin and Company have cut their tunnel 1,100 feet into the hill, and are on a regular lead of auriferous drift, which dips to the eastward. The gold is only on the western face. Coliban Reef \u2014 The party holding claim No 1 has lately crushed some good stone, 9 tons produced 36 oz. 3 dwt. of gold ; a second crush ing of 14 tons gave 11 oz. 7 dwt.

On the other quartz reefs only five claims are occupied, they being, one on the Victoria, two on the Ashtonia, one on the New Year's, aud one on the Argyle. Several of the other reefs, al though bearing gold, have not proved remune rative. The miners of this locality being but small capitalists, cannot afford to prospect to any great extent, without some present return for their expenditure. Barfold Ranges \u2014 There are about thirty miners in this locality, all the old reefs have been again occupied by them and a new dis covery has been made of an auriferous vein at a place in Green Gully, where formerly stood Mr. Steed's store. There are ten claims being worked at with earnestness, in three the reef has been struck aud gold seen. Two veins have been discovered converging from the surface downwards and meeting at the depth of thirty-five feet; the western vein is one which was wrought some four or five years ago. but the eastern one is that from which the aforementioned quartz was taken. I mentioned in my last report a discovery of some auriferous ground situate nine miles south of Malmsbury. The spot is in a small gully leading into the valley of the Kangaroo creek I hear the prospectors are doing well in the claim awarded them for the discovery, but no further extension of the auriferous deposit has been found.

A mile to the north-west of the old workings at the Four Post Kush, a payable claim has also been bottomed, but the rush occurred at such a recent date, that the value and perma- nency of the discovery have not yet been ascertained. In the neighborhood of the reef a small rush has taken place, the prospectors obtained nearly two ounces off the bottom of the shaft. A number of other shafts have been sunk around, and gold in small quantities obtained, but the prospects on the whole are not very encouraging. Raglan Division. (John Usher, Jun., Mining Surveyor.)

The slow progress made by the miners engaged in deep sinking is owing in most instances to the lightness of the machinery and the small number of men employed, in proportion to the amount of labor requisite for the speedy development of the leads referred to. The example of the Cockatoo Company, who abandoned their claim on this lead some weeks ago, is about to be followed by the Reservoir Company, who after driving some 50 feet under the Beaufort Reservoir, only succeeded in finding a lead yielding 6 dwt. to the load, with a depth of only eighteen inches of aurit'ei ous gravel. On Sailors' Gully, and its tributaries, Arden's, and the Hard Hill Leads, a considerable num ber of Chinese, and a few Europeans, find rcnumerative employment in reworking the old ground. The Champion of the Seas Company who are engaged in the completion of a puddling machine, and water tank, will shortly proceed to test their wash-dirt on a large scale, as they have already driven across what they believe to be the course of the lead. '1 he engine employed by this company is a very efficient one, and will serve to unwater a large area. At Unity Gully the shallow ground near its source has yielded about 50 oz of gold per claim, and seems to be nearly worked out, as the population is decreasing. Shepherd's Lead and its auxiliaries Cockney and Mosquito Gullies still support a small European population, The West of England Company's Claim has not yet realized the expectations of the share holders. The yield of gold from this claim has seldom exceeded 5 oz. a week, the best prospect yet obtained from it. has been half an ounce of gold washed from the gravel procured in putting in a set of timbers, say, about half a load. On the Southern Cross Lead, the only two claims which have hitherto proved unremuner ative Nos. 5 and 6 South, have recently obtained gold in poyable quantities ; but the adjoining claims which have previously yielded very handsome returns, are now making weekly dividends that amount to little more than the wages ordinarily paid to hired miners, in con sequence of the sinuous course of the lead and the difficulty experienced in tracing it. The proprietors of the prospect claim have been employed in centering their shaft, and in the erection of a puddling machine and housing for their engine, and have only just resumed underground operations. The ( 1 aribaldi or Prospectors' Company have recently bottomed a new shaft at a depth of 107 feet, the result is highly satisfactory; from about 20 tubs of auriferous gravel and pipe clay, 8 buckets washed as a trial yielded 2 dwt , and everything connected with this claim, from the masonry in which the engine is set. to the arrangements for puddling and sluicing opera tions, plainly demonstrate the confidence of the shareholders in future dividends. The value of the claim of the Royal Saxon Company has not yet been fairly tested in consequence of the superabundance of water. Below this claim, the Prince of Wales, and Beaufort Companies have just commenced '. sinking in the Police Paddock, for the supposed junction of the Southern Cross and Shepherd's, with the Main Lead. The Royal Standard Company's Works and plant are in a forward state, and the engine will be at work in a few days. The Olive Branch Company's engine and appurtenances are of a superior class, and in best working order, and as the men have com menced driving, another week or two will probably enable them to realize a favorable result. The Old Sand Hills continue to yield about the \\isual returns, although some of the pud dlers recently employed there, have had to suspend operations, as the roads had become impassable from the recent rains. The Great Republic Company have had the steam up, for some time past, but from the great weight of water and the small power of their engine, they arc working at great disad vantage. On Jock's Gully and its tributaries, there is but a small populatiou, Europeans or Chinese, very few of whom, except the owners of pud dling machines, find remunerative employment in this locality. On the Ding-dong Lead the two claims still being worked are yielding a dividend of about \u00a35 a man weekly, with a large area still in reserve. On the Garibaldi Lead in spite of the large amount of capital and labor expended there, but poor returns have been recently obtained. On McCooke's Lead the yield of gold from the prospect claim, is somewhat inferior to that of previous months. The Shamrock and Thistle Company, who got a handsomp prospect, some time back, from"], [319, "MINING SUEYEYOES' EEPOETS JULY. 299 At the German Hill, the Cockatoo Company are making extensive preparations, by the construction of tunnel, race, and store dam. for the commencement of sluicing operations in that locality. At the foot of Close's Gully, a tributary or spur of the Main Lead, is yielding favorable returns to the miners engaged there, who are principally Chinese. The contiguous gullies, from New Charcoal to Old Jonathan's, all prove remunerative for reworking as far as they have been tested by the Red Hill Sluicing Company or the pro prietors of puddling machines. On the Main Lead, the Britannia Company's shaft is through the drift but not yet bottomed The ground intervening between this claim and the Allendale Company's leased block, I have already mentioned as being occupied by two new companies, for the supposed junction of the Southern Cross and Main Leads. Near Ballaarat Gully, Messrs. Allen and Co 's Sluicing Company are profitably em ploying a number of men, and they readily sell any water they may have to spare. The Allendale Company have recently had to suspend underground operations in conse quence of the breakage of the clack piece connected with their pumping apparatus, as the pipes had to bo drAwn in order to effect the necessary repairs. At Harrison's Gully, the Wimmera Com pany are steadily occupied in reworking the old ground. At Charlton. too. the old ground is proving very remunerative to the small number of men engaged on it. most of whom are reworking the shallow diggings, or tracing the spurs of old leads in that vicinity with the aid of toms and puddling machines. It is highly probable that a party will shortly be formed to test the deep ground at the lower end of Charlton Flat with the aid of machinery, as the present workings will probably have to be abandoned in summer for want of water. The Golden Age Company are steadily at work, but from the small power of the engine and the numerical weakness of the party, has not yet given the ground a fair trial. The Fiery Creek Company is very effic:ent, both in men and machinery. Their main drive is already 260 feet in length. They have ob tained gold by boring up in several places, at depths varying from 97 feet to 104 feet from the surface. They have sunk a new shaft to a depth of 97 feet (for greater convenience in winding up their wash-dirt) which they expect to bottom in a few days. The few gullies between Charlton and the Black Swamp, at Waterloo Flat, support but a small population. The Marco Polo C ompany have recently washed over 12 oz. of gold to the machine, but from the disproportion between the horse power of their engine, and the weight of water on the Main Lead, and the comparative shal lowness of the ground they are working, this gold is supposed to have been obtained from the Argyle Lead. The Surface Hill, at the N.W. edge of the Swamp, is being worked by a new sluicing company. At Waterloo Hill and Bill's Hill, two sluic ing companies are turning the water brought there by Messrs. Watkins and Company's race (from the Swamp), to good account for mining purposes. The Flying Buck Company are waiting the arrival of an engine to enable them to resume operations. At Surface Point (South) the West of England Sluicing ( 'ompany, who are supplied partly by water derived from a continuation of Watkin's Race, and partly by water from store dams at the foot of Jonathan's and Eagle hawk gullies, still find remunerative employ ment at this extremity of the Raglan gold fields. The Raglan Company's claim is giving a weekly average of about 12 oz. of gold from the stuff got in the main drives. The Chinese whim claims are yielding very well, and the areas occupied by the proprietors of puddling machines and sluices are yielding the best returns in the division I may men tion that these claims are situate in the shallow ground usually known as the head of the lead. At New Musical Gully a prospecting party has set in at the foot of the old workings, and obtained 12 oz. to the machine. At Paddy's Gully (about half way between Musical Gully and Waterloo Mill), the pros pectors have lost their first shaft in the drift, but are getting well down with a new one. On the Argyle Lead the Royal Oak Com pany have recently bottomed a new shaft at a depth of 61 feet. They picked out several pieces of gold from the gravel obtained on the bottom, and are now engaged in erecting a whim and puddling machine. The proprietors of other claims on this lead, both Chinese and Europeans, arc all doing well. At the junction of Charcoal. Wingfield's, and Carpenter's Gullies, the Great Extended Company, who recently washed 2 dwt. of gold from a bucketfull of stuff, obtained at a depth of 1 1 6 feet from the surface, and got flooded"], [320, "300 MINING BUEYEYOBS' EEPOETS \u2014 JULY. out, have just received a 1 4 horse-power engine, and are actively preparing for its erection. At Jonathan's Gully there is nothing left of the rush that took place in May last but the prospector's party ; they work their claim by horse-power, and are getting a great deal of water and very little gold. The Golden Gate Company, who occupy the next claim, have bottomed a shaft at 107 feet. The claim is heavily watered, and will shortly require an engine. Englehawk Gully has become reoccupied by small parties of miners since the late rains. The Band of Hope Company recently took possession of the adjoining claim. They have already bottomed two shafts on the reef, and commenced sinking a third shaft. The deep ground trends suddenly towards Poverty Point Lead, which it will probably intersect near the Yam Holes Creek. Many of the miners engaged in deep sinking have made an expensive mistake. They have put in their drives at too low a level, and having had to bore up from four to fourteen feet, have found out that the heaviest deposits of gold are not in the gutter, but on the slopes of the reef. Poverty Point is unoccupied at present, but is not likely long to remain so.

The Durham Company are still carrying on their sinking operations ; the work is being pursued with a good deal of skill and ingenuity, and, indeed, from the very great quantity of water to be contended with in the basaltic rock, through which they are at present blasting their way, it requires all the experience of Ballaarat miners, in this particular class of mining, to carry on the operations, with safety to life and security to the works.

It would be well perhaps to draw attention to the fact that nearly all the gold this company is obtaining is got upon the reef a considerable distance from the gutter, and at a height of fully thirty feet above it ; I have known many other instances of rich ground being discovered under similar circumstances, and have remarked that these discoveries have been made in claims where gutter workings have been unproductive, and where the company have had energy and perseverance sufficient to thoroughly prospect the reefs. It would appear, therefore, that if the gutter or deep ground workings in a claim be unre- munerative, if companies would adopt the practice of extending their operations to reef workings, they might do so with considerable advantage to themselves. The British Company are continuing to work steadily and are obtaining moderate wages, viz., about \u00a34 per week per man The Great Eastern Company have reduced the number of their shareholders to forty-seven men, and have made a fresh start to work ; they have obtained, within the last fortnight, about 130 oz. of very rough nuggety gold.

The plan which I have forwarded will show the general course of all the leads so far as my district is concerned. The progress of quartz mining continues still to be very satisfactory, and there is a disposition to take up new claims, and engage in crushing operations. This aspect of this branch of mining may be considered highly satisfactory, as the persons who now engage in quartz working are guided by the experience which has been obtained by many years of wofk of others, and are therefore able to form a just estimate of the chances of remuneration. The course, it will be seen, of the various leads varies considerably, but after they pass out of my district they seem to take a more determinate direction. Whether the levels I have suggested would satisfactorily settle the dispute as to the direction of the main lead I am unable to say, but at least they would do something towards getting it settled. Though there have been some failures amongst the companies within my district, on the whole great confidence is felt in the remu nerative character of quartz mining operations, where carried on under good management and with proper appliances. Another new system of amalgamation has been introduced since my last report, by a manager of one of the quartz companies within my district, named Booth. The invention con sists of a species of an overshot wheel, which is made to revolve by the water and tailings from the tables falling into it. The wheel re volves in a box, on the bottom of which is placed mercury, which it is proposed to heat by a fire placed underneath. The buckets thus have to pass through the mercury, and thus are supposed to bring every particle of sand in contact with it. In alluvial mining there has been no change whatever. I have forwarded a plan of my district, showing the surface levels and the depths from the surface of the various gold workings. The importance of this work being con tinued throughout the whole of the district of Ballaarat Proper is considered very great, as at the present time a very large number of per sons are interested in knowing the course of the supposed main lead of Ballaarat. By a comparison of the surface levels with those of the gutters, some opinions may be formed as to the general dip of the ground, and there fore the payable course of the main leads into which all the subsidiary ones are supposed to fall. The chief merit of the invention seems to be that a large quantity of stuff can be passed through, and that the mercury is kept in a constant state of agitation by the buckets pass ing through it. Whether the invention will answer the expectations formed of it I am un able to say, but it at least seems worthy of a trial. Beyond my district a large number of junc tions have taken place, the levels of which I believe have not yet been ascertained ; and we consequently have at the present time an im mense amount of speculation on the supposed course of the main lead, based upon very un reliable data. No. 4 Division. (Michael O'Malley, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Supposing the whole of the district of Bal laarat Proper to have been properly levelled and the depths of the gutters from the surface to have been ascertained, the general fall of the country might be seen and some conclusions drawn. Thus it is by many supposed that the leads in the neighborhood of Buninyong are trend ing towards Ballaarat, whilst others as strongly maintain that the whole of the Ballaarat leads are taking a course nearly due south.

The portion of the gutter recently worked has not been over rich, but some stuff is presently being raised which promises weD. The gross yield of gold obtained by both companies, from the joint tenancy, since May, 1860, until the date of their dissolution some four months since, was about \u00a340,000, of which upwards of \u00a31200 was expended in litigation, &c, before the tenancy could be established, and by all appearance this sum is likely to be considerably supplemented by the legal expenses of another suit which is presently pending in the Court of Mines, be tween the Bed Jacket and Nelson Companies, in regard to a further joint tenancy claimed by the former to that portion of the (trunk) lead within the claim of the latter, which lies beyond the original boundary of the Bed Jacket Com pany.

The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 18s. 3d. to \u00a33 19s. per oz. With the exception of a small rush to Break o'Day Hill, near Bokewood, mining matters in this division have undergone little or no change during the month, or, in fact, I may say during the last six months. However, the rush re ferred to is likely to cause some new ground to be opened up in that district, and, so far as can be judged from present appearances, is likely to afford remunerative employment to some 40 or 50 men for a few months to come. About ten companies, comprising in the aggregate 40 men, are already obtaining good wages, and, in two or three instances, as much as \u00a38 or \u00a310 per man weekly is being obtained: but it is considered the lead or run of gold will soon pass from Crown lands into the private property of Mr. Elder, and if so, the diggers apprehend they will experience some considerable difficulty in arranging with that gentleman for permission to mine thereon. The present depth of sinking is about 70 feet, principally through hard clay, cement, and gravel; and What appears strangest about the matter is the position or course of the run or gutter across the summit of a pretty high hill, where, a year or two since, persons would never think of prospecting for gold ; but of late several of the hills in this district have been proved to contain narrow dry runs or leads of gold, which in most instances have afforded good wages as long as they lasted, but generally they have been found to run out or die away suddenly. The Working Miners' Company have been this time back very much baffled by a fine quick sand drift, struck underneath the fourth rock at a depth of 372 feet from the surface. This drift was with considerable difficulty sunk through, by means of piles, to a depth of 6 feet, when a stratum of something between cement and sandstone was struck, which was at first con sidered to be the bottom; but upon passing through 7 or 8 inches of this stuff a brownish sort of stiff sandy stratum, with a slight ad mixture of what appears to be decomposed vegetable matter or moory soil is found under lying it, to a depth (as ascertained by boring) of 5 feet, and this latter is expected to overlie the auriferous drift, but owing to the great difficulties experienced in getting through the upper drift and at the same time baling the water, which came in in large volume from the bottom of the superincumbent rock, the company have not as yet been able to get to the bottom of the lower stratum ; however, they expect to do so during the month, and are very sanguine as to ultimate success, so much so that a share, even under the present adverse circumstances, could not be purchased at \u00a31000. (There are 57 shares in the company.) The Defiance Company (late Cumberland, Durham, and Cornish Company ) have lately got into a gutter, at a distance of about 450 feet in a south-westerly direction from their shaft.

The I'rince of Wales Company have recently resumed underground operations and are driving in a N.E. direction for the Cobbler's gutter, which they expect to strike about 500 or 600 feet from their shaft. Shares in this company are eagerly looked for, and command high prices : \u00a3750 is quoted as the present price, with an upward tendency. The company's new engine works admirably ; it is perhaps the most substantial plant and best housed in the Ballaarat district. It is estimated only as a 50 horse-power, but the company's engineer reckons it as a 55.

The yield obtained by the Comet Company during the last fortnight, however, has been about 8 dwt. per ton, and from the appearance of the stone which is presently being raised, it is expected this rate of yield will continue for the current month. This company are about taking up, under lease, an additional area of 200 by 3U0 yards immediately adjoining their old lease hold on the west side, and have been induced to do so in consequence of having discovered a nice looking reef out-cropping about the mid dle of the ground referred to.

I believe the Heart and Hand Company are satisfied with the prospects obtained from their first trial crushing, but as yet I have not been able to ascertain the exact yield. The company have erected a nice battery of six stampers, with which they can crush 24 tons of cement per day ; and as their working expenses will be very small, they think they will be able to make the place pay, provided the cement should continue anything like what they have hitherto met with.

The Cleft of t e Rock is not turning out so encouraging as was at first supposed it would do ; the general opinion is that they have not got the 1-lappy Valley gutter at all, but only the Old Spring Dallah gutter. On the last named lead the Lord IS'elson and Duke of Wellington claims have been bottomed, but the prospects are very indifferent. Number of distinct quartz reefs which have been actually proved to be auriferous to the present time, 6. The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 18s. to \u00a33 18s. 3d. per oz. Nothing in quartz crushing has been done during the past month. I beg to forward you the following report of the state of this mining division during the month of August, 1861. No further test of the newly discovered quartz reef at Smythesdale, reported in my last, has been made beyond the first trial crushing. The prospecting party have at present 60 tons raised which will be soon submitted to the stamping batteries ; until then operations will be only conducted with a view to the security and possession of the claims. The Grand Junction Company have their engine nearly erected. The two engine companies on the Nugget Flat have not done much during the month. The Morning Light claim on Smythesdale Flat is worked out. The Bobin Hood are pretty far advanced with the sinking of their shaft; this claim stands in very high repute. The Britannia, Surprise, and Pioneer claims are getting on as usual, making moderate wages. The British have struck into the gutter and got swamped out ; prospects good. The Perseverance have commenced work again aud are doing but little. The North American continues to pay well, \u00a3 1 6 per man was the dividend last week. The Centaur will be a very good claim. The Ivanhoe is paying from \u00a3 1 0 to \u00a3 1 2 per man weekly. The Don Juan and Lucky claims stand well for the Linton and Slaughteryurd Hill Leads. The Albion is too shallow for the gutter, but they have got gold on the reef. At Linton no fresh ground has been opened during the month. The Emu Hill claim has been tried and proved to be too shallow for the Linton Leads, the course of which is pretty well ascertained to pass from the Atlas claim into the Linton paddock. The Atlas Company are doing very well at present. The Band of Hope are blocking Out and receiving very fair returns. The Great Western have done first-rate for the month; they had \u00a317 per man for the week ending 17th August. The Beaumont continues still very good The Caledonia as usual. The Hed Hill very poor ; they are nnder the belief that they have struck a new lead in the claim, but the drive is not sufficiently advanced yet to confirm it. The Beliance and Mines Boyal poor. The Bute, and Browne's Junction, and Golden Gate are doing very well. The Cr\u0153sus, Lord John Eusstll, and Wash ington Companies, paying moderately ; nothing new has occurred on the Undaunted Lead, Black Hill. The Hand-in-Hand new shaft not yet bottomed. The Grand Junction have bottomed their new shaft much too shallow ; they are driving for the gutter. The United Brownes are getting very good ground ; there are a few claims on Browne's Flat, but none of them are doing much. None of the quartz mining companies in the locality of Browne's are paying except the British Workman. All the aUuvial claims on Monkey Gully are doing well ; their receipts are about the same as they have been for a long time back. The Pioneer in the paddock are getting nothing. John Bull not yet bottomed. Duke of Cornwall beginning to pay tolerably well Edinburgh, Glenmorgan, and Little Wonder paying first rate ; farther up the Standard Lead there are some claims paying as well as ever, the old ground well rewarding the second workers. The Black Lead is paying moderately. At Camgham matters are rather dull, the rhajority of the claims there not making more than 30s to 40s. per week, such as the Gnome, Magnum Bonum, Telegraph, Bed Lion, and Bedford. The same may be said of the alluvial work ings at Italian Uully ; nothing particular or requiring special notice having transpired there during the month. The Spring Dallah Quartz"], [333, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS AUGUST. 311 The Sherwood is giving very good dividends, generally from \u00a36 to \u00a310 per man weekly. In the quartz mining nothing has been done for several weeks back The Cairngorm Com pany are driving, but have found nothing yet. Preston's Hill, private property, continues as good as ever. The shallow diggings all over the district present nothing new to require particular mention. The machinery is as follows Creswick Division. (James Stevenson, Mining Surveyor.)

I have the honor to report that mining in the < lunes portion of my district continues steadily to advance. The Port Phillip Company have crushed from July 28th to August 24th (the period of their usual fortnightly returns) 2384 tons of quartz, which yielded 1441 oz 17 dwt 3 gr. in bar gold , the average yield per ton being 1 2 dwt. 2 gr. The manager has resolved upon the discontinuation of burning the large blocks of stone supplied to them by th ; Clunes Company, and have ordered a hydraulic machine, which is being manufactured in Melbourne, for the purpose of reducing the large blocks of stone to a fit size for delivery to the batteries. The machine will be similar to Appleton's patent for breaking Milestone metal, but works with water instead of the lever principle. Another pump is being fitted up to increase the supply of water for the batteries, this will be worked from the donkey engine. A hydraulic machine is being constructed on the company's works, after the design of Mr. Bees Davies, the com pany's engineer, for the purpose of facilitating the driving home of stamp heads to the lifters, and for raising any heavy weights required by the company. The machine will be of a port able character and generally applicable. I shall take an opportunity of describing its details on completion. A working model battery is in course of construction at the works, to be forwarded to the Great Exhibition in London, 1862; the contract has been given to some of our most skilful artisans, and it will doubtless be a fine piece of work; sheds have been specially erected for the convenience of the contractors. At the Bald Hills all the claims which have been getting gold still continue to pay remark ably well; more attention than formerly has been given to the lead, and shares in the different claims have advanced enormously; shares have sold for \u00a31000, and shareholders in the Homeward Bound and Sons of Justice Companies are now asking considerably more ; the only claim bottomed since my last report is that of the Better Late Than Never Company, who have struck gold at a depth of 135 feet. The Bise and Shine Company have their engine erected and will commence mining work immediately ; the Sons of Justice are still sinking their new shaft and erecting their engine; two new claims on this lead have been taken up during the month. On Graham's Hill six of the claims continue to average from 4 to 10 oz. weekly or from 1 to 2^ oz. per man ; the wash-dirt in the other claims is much poorer, but as the ground is patchy, the miners persevere and sometimes make good wages therefrom. At Ironstone Hill, Slaty Creek, only four claims are now workiDg; at this place the vein of gold apparently terminated on its reaching the creek, as several attempts to trace it along its bed proved unsuccessful. As I have already stated, during this month gold has been struck on the opposite range but lower down the creek; the yield is not great, but is sufficient to pay very good wages, being about 3 dwt to the tub, especially as the ground is worked by tunnelling into the side of the hill instead of sinking shafts; three claims in succession have got gold, and I believe it is the continua tion of Ironstone Lead. Clunes Quartz Mining Company. \u2014 They are generally continuing their workings, details of which have been stated, and are working the newly struck Welcome Beef which where cut, proved to be 13 feet wide by making a drive northwards on the lode to their boundary, the quartz looks to be of a very paying character. On the western reef they have some very fine stone. Bobinson's and the Eastern Beefs are also being operated upon, but there is nothing new in the appearance of these lodes. The machinery to work the mine from the new main shaft is in a forward state of completion. I have before noted the excellence of the arrangements. The chimney shaft is nearly raised to its destined elevation of 68 feet. The company give employment to about 148 men. Present depth of mine 25o feet. On the Bocky Lead, Bullarook, the three parties who have struck gold are engaged in making preparations and erecting machinery for properly working their claims ; all the other claims are still engaged in sinking. None of the parties on Tunnel Hill have yet struck gold; one of the tunnels is in now about 1500 feet, and the party are still driving through hard reef and have expressed their determina tion to go 500 feet before they give up. I have never met with greater perseverance in gold mining than is shown by the different parties working on this hill, who are all Italians. Criterion Company are working Eobinson's Reef; and simply extending their workings, which have been noted. They will shortly put down their shaft other 150 feet and open out cross-cuts to iWelone their resources at a At the Old Bullarook diggings, Craig and party have erected for puddling an eight horse power portable engine, the party ate only wash-"], [335, "313 MINING SURVEYORS REPORTS \u2014 AUGUST. greater depth, this however, is not a compulsory operation as they have opened out a sufficient supply of quartz for a long period of time. They have crushed from July 28th to 31st August, 853 tons 12 cwt. of quartz, which yielded 588 oz. 10 dwt. 10 gr. of gold, aver aging per ton, 13 dwts. 19 gr. The cost of raising and crushing per ton has not varied from last statement, namely 24s. The depth of the mine is 165 feet; men employed 50. employed is a 40 horse-power horizontal high pressure engine, with multitubular boiler, 96 tubes, 3-inch diameter, 8 feet long. The erec tion of the machinery, &c, appears to be all that could be desired. The pit work is con tracted for. The pipes will be 14 inches in diameter, 600 feet length, to be worked with two plungers and one drawing lift, 12 feet stroke. Clunes Alliance Quartz Mining Company are at present sinking their main shaft ; the present depth is 225 feet ; it will be put down to 322 feet before they will open out cross-cuts. They are at present sinking through quartz in which gold has been seen. The width of this lode is 6 feet, and it gives forth a large volume of water, necessitating constant pumping. The quartz is exceedingly hard, and is in layers, which makes it very bad for blasting; the work is therefore progressing slowly. They employ 30 men. and have expended for the past month \u00a3507. Their battery has not been yet put into effective working order : it is therefore the intention of the management to have tested by the Port Phillip Company about 20 tons of quartz from the new reef which they have struck in sinking. C'unes United Quartz Mining Company \u2014 Yield from July 26th to August 23rd, being four weeks' crashing, tons reduced, 437 ; gold obtained, 207 oz. 12 dwt. ; average per ton. 9 dwt 1 2 gr. The whole of the quartz crushed was from Bobinson's Beef, which is about 14 feet wide. The company are erecting gear for dropping the lifts, aud intend to commence sinking immediately. The company consists of 32 shareholders ; they have hitherto been crushing with only twelve stampers, but it is their intention to shortly erect twelve additional stamp heads I have no doubt from the steady yields and large lodes of this extensive claim but that, with more efficient machinery, this will be a very paying mine. Yankee Quartz Mining Company. \u2014 Their works appear to be in first-class order ; at present they are working from each of the paying reefs in their claim, namely, the Western, Bobinson's, and Eastern, as well as the newly found Welcome Lode, with the following result : \u2014 quantities crushed. 450 tons ; yield. 490 oz. 6 dwt. ; average per ton 1 oz. 2 dwt. This return is from July 28th to the 3'st August. The cost of raising the stone and crushing is about 20s per ton Depth of mine, 300 feet ; men employed, 40 to 50 in number The average earnings of alluvial miners in this place have from time to time been stated; the returns handed to me show no deviation; the several parties are simply earning wages. I have however to mention that the Young Sons of Freedom Company have commenced to erect a battery of six stampers, to reduce the cement met with in their claim. I have seen gold in the quartz boulders and cement raised by this company. They intend to pass all their alluvial dirt through the battery, having by experiments proved that they have lost by the use of the puddling machine a great portion of the fine gold. The preparation for erecting the engine and battery, and consequent attendant works, are nearly complete. A considerable amount in labor has been laid out to fix up passes and lay down a new tramroad. The Victoria Quartz Mining Company. \u2014 The workings upon numbers 1, 2, and 3 levels on the eastern reef, are being pursued with. The block of quartz mentioned in my last as having: been cut. by an eastern drive, has proved to be the Welcome Lode ; it is with this com pany, after taking an average, about 5 feet wide. From a trial made, the stone will yield 15 or 16 dwt per ton. The company have a fine sample of quartz raised at this time, from which they look for very considerably improved yields. The stone being obtained from the eastern reef also looks much better. Tons crushed, 493 ; yield, 156 oz 4 dwt.; per ton, 6 dwt. 8$!; ; men employed, 49 ; expenditure for the month, \u00a3550 10s. Pioneer Quartz Mining Company.\u2014 -I have recently been called upon to survey a mining claim for twenty proprietors under this head. The situation is 1 J mile from the boundary of the Alliance Company. On this claim a reef crops out upon the surface, and there is little doubt of its being a continuation of one of the quartz lodes now being worked at Clunes Proper I have heretofore stated an opinion, which I believe is generally consented to, that the fact of gold bearing quartz lodes or veins having been struck by accident, warrants the presumption that bands of unknown quartz lodes traverse the substrata, and that therefore in prospecting for the continuations of known reefs, with the chance of striking others of equal or greater value, renders such efforts New North Clunes Mining Company. \u2014 The fitting up of the engine and boiler has been completed ; these arrangements are very com pact and suitable.

A few of the miners on this field have left for the New Zealand diggings. On Dolly's Creek, Morrison's, and Tea-tree Creek, the diggings are still steadily pro gressing, and with the usual average results. I am happy to state that the Lai Lai Water Company have, this day (3rd August) brought their race, 52 sluice heads, into Dolly's Creek: they have taken up several large block claims for their own working, and will let the water to miners working adjoining claims: it will be the means of developing ground hitherto unworked through deficiency of water, and unpayable from price of carting and uncertainty of water. The Hit or Miss Company have erected a 4 horse-power engine on their claim, and are now engaged in sluicing. The results from information are, 1 believe, payable on the whole. I can state that this district is in an average healthy and prosperous condition.

Blackwood Division. (Thomas Hay, Mining Surveyor ) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Morning Star Company have finished the erection of their stamping battery, appa ratus, &c., but unfortunately their process for saving and collecting gold has proved a com plete failure ; I believe it is their intention to adopt the principle of the Blackwood machine (plans of which I have sent). The Albion Company have been constantly engaged in raising and crashing quartz ; but I am not able to state the quantity or results, owing as I before mentioned to the unwilling ness of those engaged to give any authentic information ; I am of opinion their results must be good as the vein has been always a rich and highly remunerative one. Private Companies.\u2014 The Birmingham Beef Prospect Claim are at present engaged in crush ing their quartz at the Blackwood machine, and will not complete the same for a few days.

The following information has been obtained relative to the quantity of Quartz crushed during the month, and the Gold obtained therefrom : \u2014 The mines in this division have scarcely yet recovered from the effects of the late heavy floods, which caused so much damage both to quartz and alluvial diggings. The water is kept up in many instances in the quartz mines, through, at intervals, heavy falls of rain, which although much less than during the month of July, yet produces a great quantity of surface water, whichjiercolates to the mines and is a eaise of great inconvenience and expense. This, however, would be obviated if the machinery employed to unwater the mines were more powerful and perfect in their nature and for draining purposes more generally applied. The alluvial diggings have not yet been reinstated ; many claims have been abandoned. so completely have the late floods destroyed them. Some young men have left these diggings for New Zealand, as far as I can learn about 30 in number, but this as yet has had no effect in reducing the amount of population, as the deficiency thus caused has been supplied by an influx of diggers from Ballaarat and other places, and large quartz claims have been taken by some of them on Simmons' Reef north. Simmons' Reef.\u2014 The Imperial Company have not yet recovered their works from the effects of the late floods They have during the present month been employed principally with unwatering the mine and effecting repairs of damages made by an influx of water. The Lerderderg Company have been at a stand during the month ; the cause I believe to be wint of funds. The Simmons' Reef Quartz Mining Company, discouraged by the small yield of gold last obtained, have stopped their works and during this interval to call a meeting of the share holders, as I am told, to decide upon future proceedings. Appleton Brothers have not done much during this month, but in point of yield (2J oz. to the ton) they far exceed any of the others, and I find their prospects are good. The Cornish Company have been moving steadily through the month, and their yield of gold to the ton of quartz is singularly regular, from 4 to 4-J dwt. Williams and Company, to the north of, and adjoining the Lerderderg Company's works, have been moving on a small scale.

Spring Creek, Three-Mile, and Wool- shed Divisions. Trewhella Brothers, as usual, prosperous. Robin Hood Company. \u2014 Although the yield is somewhat diminished from the former month, their prospects are good and they are going on with spirit and success. (Henry Grimes, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows The Concordia Company (late United Com pany) are going on. but a little disheartened by the small yield of gold on their last crush ings \u2014 only 5 dwt. to the ton. Hewson and Company, on Hewson's Reef, are still making preparations to extend their works, and to render them more complete. The system adopted by these parties in setting out the works is judicious and miner-like ; but the reef, as far as it has yet been laid open, is not of a first-rate order. The Caledonian Company, Johnsons Reef, have been occupied in sinking and storing quartz. Operations have been resumed on Wilson's Beef, which has been at a stand for some time. A good deal of quartz has been brought to land, but none yet crushed. I am disposed to think, from what I have seen, that the yield will be good, as the gold is thickly visible in the quartz. Alluvial diggings generally have not yet recovered from the effects of the late inunda tion ; but some sluicers are doing well, and several new claims have been taken up near the plains, on the Pyrette diggings, on the west side of the Gisborne road from Bacchus Marsh. The sinking is from 80 to 100 feet, and the prospects so far very fair. Remarks. \u2014 Population steady ; a few going off to New Zealand. The machinery is as follows In taking a present and retrospective view of quartz mining in Blackwood, I am impelled to remark that, in my opinion, it falls far short of that state of prosperity which, under dif ferent auspices than those unfortunately pre vailing here, it would enjoy. This want of success does not arise from any deficiency in the spirit of enterprise on the part of the adventurers ; of this there is ample proof that they possess no small share, nor does it emanate from want of a wide field for successful mining speculation, as the number of proved highly auriferous quartz reefs within this division will show ; and although I am bound to say, that in some instances there prevails an evident want of mining skill, yet all the deficiencies would be obviated by a proper amount of capital judiciously applied.

There is no want of mining resources in the shape of productive quartz reefs, as I have said before, nor in the physical formation of the country for mining operations ; each of these Blackwood is favored with, but the great desiderata is capital, coupled with milling skill.

It is octohedron, and much purer than the previous ten or so that have been found. A couple of diamonds have also been found by some Frenchmen in a claim near Sebastopol, found in hard cement mixed with quartz gravel. I send down a plan of Snake's Head Creek, or the Serpentine, as the miners c ill it. which is almost entirely worked for the stream tin found in its bed, and which pays men from \u00a33 to \u00a35 per week. The engine belonging to Mr. Shcard, of 6 horse-power, has been standing for this month, as, from the late rains, he found it difficult and expensive to remove the quartz from his reef, about 40 tons of which has been brought to grass. Yackandandah and Nine-mile Divisions. (Thos. G. Kennan, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Alfred Lead, at the head of Mopoke Gully, mentioned in my last report, has (with the exception of the prospecting claim) been deserted, in consequence of its poverty. The several other frontage leads (over 40 feet deep) are, with the exception of the Perseverance, in little better condition. The machinery is as follows The miners generally on the sluicing claims arc assiduously and steadily at work. At the El Dorado Hutchins' party are finding their ground very patchy ; Kneebone's party have not commenced blocking out yet, but are still drr#ng. McEvoy's, after driving some 1 00 yards into the bank, have come on the lead and original bed of the creek ; their claim is therefore looking up ; they are going to sink a fresh shaft in the bank instead of the bed of the creek, as at present. Wellington's long drive having been swamped twice by an underground rush of water, has fallen in ; they have commenced driving beneath their old one in the soft granite rock, and, with McEvoy's discovery, with increased hopes.

The population is as follows Mining matters in both divisions have pro gressed very favorably during the past two months, the large supply of water having ma terially facilitated the general workings. Yet, even in the face of such an unusually large supply, many parties complain of not having enough, tending to show that water to an almost inconceivable amount could be profit ably employed, as also that no lack of payable auriferous ground exists. In the Yackandan dah division, almost the whole of Staghorn Flat has been taken up by miners under the extended area for machinery bye-law ; and two engines, one of eight horse-power and another of four are about to be erected for pumping purposes. On Sandy Creek a num ber of surface c'aims have been taken up, and some parties are erecting whims to work the bed of the creek. In the Nine-mile division no new ground has been taken up. Remarks. \u2014 Population very unsettled with the reports from New Zealand. The machinery is as follows In quartz mining I have to report the disco very of two new reefs, one called the Eagle Reef, and the other the Homeward Bound. The Eagle Beef is situated near Clear Creek, on the same side of the range as the Coinasino. The Homeward Bound is the first reef disco vered in the Nine-mile division, and is situated near Rocky Point (the lower end of the ISine mile), on the same line of ranges as Hender son's Reef. From neither of these reefs has any stone been crushed, but gold seems to be pretty well distributed throughout the quartz. A number of parties on Henderson's Reef have had their stone crushed, but I believe it did not turn out well ; the amount of the quan tity crashed or the yield, I could not ascertain. The Coiniisino Reef leaseholders are progress ing favorably with their machine ; the wheel, 30 feet diameter, is completed and in working order, as also the framework for the stampers ; and the owners expect to commence crushing in about three weeks.

Buckland Division. (R. H. Stone, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Many parties still continue re- working aban doned ground on the Indigo leads and are realizing good wages. Very little change has taken place on the Wahgunyah leads, the results verifying the correctness of last month's report. A new lead called the Homeward Bound, situate about 2| miles north-west of Christmas Town (plan 8), is sunk to a depth of 245 feet, with much water and wash-dirt about 4 feet thick, with a return of 1J dwt. to five small American buckets. The Mona Lead is paying well with wash-dirt of about 18 inches thick, yielding 13^ oz. to about 19 loads. The original prospectors on Robert Burns Lead have sunk a new shaft on the south side of old shaft ; wash-dirt about 1 foot thick, which will average about 1 oz. to the load, good; supposed to be a new run or lead. Of quartz workings I have but little to report. If water were available and machinery for crushing at hand, the only machine being 4j_j miles distant over a very bad road, it would give a great impetus to that branch of mining, if I may judge from the small quantities crushed during the month from the various leaders which have proved payable.

The quartz from No. 1 South has been the poorest yet crushed from this claim, but I am informed that this stone was some of the refuse, and the decreased yield does not therefore indicate any present sidling oft' in the prospects of this claim. I am now continuing the survey of the division and will forward a plan, in continu ation of No. 1, of the Ovens River, during the present week. Buckland Division. (Western Portion.) (H. C. Campbell, Mining Surveyor ) The population is as follows : \u2014 No. 2 South, on this reef, has yielded a better return during the month ; but the quartz was taken from near the cap of the reef, and I do not expect that a much greater quantity will be obtained from this part of the claim As soon as all the payable surface quartz is removed, this company will continue sinking. On Richardson's Beef the prospecting party are continuing to raise very good quartz from the surface workings at the south end of their claim ; at present they are not working the deeper levels. The Beliance Beef is continuing to yield very rich stone, but only one parcel of two tons has yet been crushed ; this was picked quartz, and very rich, having yielded 138 oz. per ton. About 200 tons is ready to be removed to the machine. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Home Reef continues to yield well, and is likely to remain one of the best in the dis trict. The Bellville Beef also looks promising, but very little work has yet been done. The other reefs in this division remain as reported last month, and as veiy little quartz has been crashed from any one of them, I am unable to give any additional information. There is so small an amount of capital amongst the quartz miners in this district that the development of the reefs takes place but very slowly in most instances; the claimholders are, consequently, holding and working their ground with as few men as possible. Number of distinct quartz reefs which have been actually proved to be auriferous to the present time. 5. The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 15s to \u00a33 18s. per oz. The following information has been obtained relative to the quantity of Quartz crushed during the month, and the Gold obtained therefrom. The Benalla quartz reefs have not yet been properly tried as there is no means of crushing the stone. One ton was sent to Chiltern to have it tested ; the yield was as stated above. In this division considerable activity prevails. and much attention is given to the gold field recently discovered at Benalla, as well as to the Jamieson field, both of which there is every reason to expect will prove extensive and rich. Benalla. \u2014 The mines are situated about three miles west of Benalla. At present six reefs have been discovered ; the general direction is about N. 22\u00b0 W. The quartz appears to be highly auriferous, specks of gold being visible throughout. The want of crushing machinery in the neighborhood has prevented the stone being tested properly ; but one ton from one of the reefs was crushed and yielded 3 oz. 15 dwt. 20 gr. ; the stone selected was a fair sample of ' that found in the reef.

There are thirteen shafts now sinking on quartz reefs, and the miners are sanguine as to success. Alluvial Sinking. \u2014 Three parties have sunk to a depth of from 130 to 140 feet where they have got a good prospect. There will be a scarcity of water here in summer as the only permanent water is the Broken River, a distance of nearly three miles off. The nature of the country is not favorable for making reservoirs being too flat. No water has yet been found in sinking, with the exception of a little in one shaft at a depth of 140 feet. Hellshole. \u2014 This place has been deserted the miners having gone to the Jamieson. Only one claim is worked, it is a bank claim and the owners of it are doing very well. as to the number of persons, but from all the information I could get there must be about 3000 ; numbers are daily arriving. There is great difficulty in getting stores, even as far as the Jamieson, carriage being about \u00a322 per ton from Melbourne ; from the Jamieson to Drammond's Point, \u00a325 per ton ; from Jamieson to Cherry's, \u00a350 per ton. The tracks which have been made are in many places dangerous, being so narrow that horses could not pass each other, should they meet. A sum of \u00a3300 per mile would make a safe track ; this estimate is formed from the cost of cutting races, of which there are several. Some of the miners gave me an estimate much below this. SANDHUBST MINING DISTRICT. Kangakoo Flat Division. (Edward T. Harper, Mining Suiveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Jamieson Gold Field. \u2014 This field is one of great importance and includes a large tract of country along the northern side of the Dividing Range, drained by numerous creeks, which ultimately find their way into the Goulburn. On the River Jamieson itself, there are at present no workings ; but as what is known as the Jamieson Flat, at its junction with the Goulburn, the farthest point drays can take stores to supply the various workings, a little township has sprung up here and given its name to the gold field. The principal workings at present are Gaff ney's Creek, about 25 miles south of Jamieson Flat, and the Upper Goulburn about the same distance south east. On Gaffney's Creek, at a place called I irummond's Point, there is a col lection of huts with a few stores. On the Upper Goulburn a similar collection of huts has taken place at Cheny's Point. Numerous small creeks and gullies are worked amongst the ranges ; the working is generally in the creeks and their banks, and these have hitherto proved so rich that but little attention has been given to quartz reefs, though these are known to exist, and where tried are exceedingly rich. One is worked at Drammond's Point by Demp scy and party ; the yield from about 7 cwt. of quartz was 153 oz. of gold \u2014 eight tons yielded 370 oz., and the average yield of one hundred tons was 15 oz. per ton. A water-wheel has been put up here that works eight stampers; at present the depth of the shaft is only 23 feet On the Upper Goul burn a reef is worked; its exact yield I was not able to ascertain, but I was informed it was at least equal to Dempsey's. The greatest number of miners collected in one place on this field is on the Upper Goul burn.

Lindsy, the second claim south of this, are breaking down from their boundary stone which was left, almost equal to Karly's. The Victoria Reef is springing again into life; a new reef was struck lately in the Advance Company's claim within 17 feet of the surface : this reef was cut in the deep shaft when sinking for the main reef, and was never afterwards thought of; the reef will average 3 feet thick ; 5 tons were crushed yesterday which yielded 80 ozs. ; they are likely to hold this reef to a good depth. The Prince Alfred Company it is supposed have struck the same stone ; should this reef continue north and south along the hill, it will enhance the value of some of those claims from which no gold has been obtained being on the eastern side of the hill. Many of the abovementioned engines crush for the public and receive stone from twenty different places, so that it is difficult to give a minute table of the localities, quantities, yields and depths, as above specified.

Kilmore Division. (H. C. Campbell, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 I attribute this falling off to two different causes, firstly, the New Zealand rash, and secondly, the great objection and perhaps in ability of the puddlers to pay the tax imposed upon them by the sludge byelaw, which amounts to \u20ac2 per quarter for each mill : even those who are in possession of payable ground strongly demur to the payment of this assess ment in localities where the sludge drain can be of no benefit to them, such as the neighbor hood of Sydney Flat and Back Creek at Huntly. The Huntly and Epsom miners, however, seem to porsevere, and I cannot discover that any diminution has taken place in the population of that portion of the division. Some new shafts have been sunk on the alluvial leads, and several new whims are being erected. The miners, nevertheless, find it very difficult to keep the water down by horse-power, par ticularly as it is almost impossible to make them work together. The powerful pumping engine, however, about to be put up on the Huntly lead by Messrs. Brown and Company, will no doubt be effective, and supersede the use of whims altogether. That company, known as the Ballaarat Company, are sink'ng their shaft day and night, and going vigorously to work. The machinery is as follows Total value of all mining plant in the division, \u00a318,000. The extension of alluvial surfacing and shallow sinking in the Whipstick scrub still progresses ; it cannot be said that any of the large patches of auriferous ground are very rich, but they afford a living to a great many men, and the greater number appear to be doing tolerably well. Number of distinct quartz reefs which have been actually proved to be auriferous to the present time, 6 1 . In this division there is little to add to the report of last month. On Reedy Creek quartz mining is resumed and the yield is good. Nothing of any importance has been done on the quartz reefs, the yield being of the usual average. A great many claims are under the protection of the new bye-law, and will remain so until an efficient Drainage Act be brought into force.

The shaft is sunk to the east of the reef, which underlies to that direction, with the intention of cutting the reef at a depth of 600 feet. The nature of the ground sunk through is a blue schist rock, intersected with numerous quartz veins. The sinking is very hard, and every foot has to be blasted. The enormous quan tity of water which is found in the reef compels the use of powerful machinery. An engine of 55 horse-power is employed in pumping and crushing. The stroke is 8 feet, and the diameter of the pipes 12 inches. The stone is raised by means of a 16 horse-power engine. From the highly auriferous nature of the quartz, and the hitherto very large yields obtained, a prosperous future may be antici pated for this company. Heathcote and Wakanga Divisions. (Blayney W. Walshe, Mining Surveyor ) The population is as follows : \u2014 Parkin's Reef (the discovery of which I mentioned in my last month's report), Wattle Flat, is being worked by several companies. The prospecting claim is worked by a company of twenty shareholders, who look upon their claim as very valuable property. Tbe reef, as before stated, runs east and west, directly breaking across the strata, and is 4 feet thick, the stone being a curious admixture of quartz and sandstone, in nearly all of which gold is perceptible. About 60 tons has been raised, but none as yet has been crushed. The com pany are sinking a 60-feet shaft. 6x4 feet in size, intending to drive to the back of the reef, and working it only through the one shaft Several claims have been taken up along the line of the reef, both to the eastward and westward of the prospect claim In No. I West, Buck and party, the reef shows well. apparently getting better as it gets deeper. ffo stone has yet been crashed to enable the average yield being ascertained.

The Long Gully Company (leaseholders), in Long Gully, have also come upon some fine looking stone.

Norris's Company, on Norris's Beef, Argyle Gully, have crushed 100 tons, which yielded 102 oz. of gold.

Spring Creek is twelve miles from Bedcastle, seventeen from Bushworth, and twenty-five from Heathcote. About 50 miners are work ing there, both in the alluvial and quartz. and Company's prospectiug claim the quartz has averaged 2\u00a3 oz. to the ton. The proprietors are getting out large quantities of antimony to send to England. They have applied for a lease of 10 acres of ground for the purpose of erecting machineiy and building dams, and not only will their revenues be benefited but a great boon will be conferred on the miners there, as at present all quartz, Sec, has to be sent to Bedcastle to be crushed at a cost of 18s. per ton cartage. The alluvial workers, although not making large profits, are obtaining very good wages, and appear satisfied. Some two or three new quartz reefs have been lately struck, which have proved auri ferous. The reef in the Prospect Claim from a thick ness of 6 feet ran out to a mere thread, but has again gradually swelled to 8 feet. No doubt as the workings are carried to a greater depth the antimony will disappear and be replaced by a quartz reef of great richness. An engine, to drive 8 heads of stampers, is daily expected to arrive, and, when erected, no doubt many claims now abandoned will be again taken up, and worked with profit. The place is small, and generally very little is known of the proceedings of the people there located. At Morris and Stewart's claim, near No. 2 Prospect Claim South, a very rich vein of quartz about 3 inches thick, has been struck. The stone is thickly studded with gold, and will no doubt wheu crushed, give a handsome return. Bedcastle. \u2014 The statistical returns from this part of the division show the reefs generally to be highly auriferous. Two new reefs, about a mile and a mile and a half from the township, have been lately struck. From the Mariner's but little stone has been tested, but that little appears to have yielded satisfactoty returns, for several claims have been taken up on it From the Emeu Beef 10 tons have been crushed, which gave a yield of 2 J oz. to the ton. A prospect claim has been taken up at the Old Antimony. The reef was found on the surface, and has been worked to a depth of 8 feet. On the surface it was 12 inches thick, diminishing at 8 feet to 6 inches. Gold has been seen in the metal, but no crushing has yet taken place to determine the yield. On the Curly Dog Gully Beef the claims are paying handsomely, some turning out as much as 3 oz to the ton. Considerable difficulty is said to exist in separating the gold from the antimony when crushed and great quantities of gold are sup posed to be lost in consequence Some method of preventing this by the entire and easy separation of the gold from the antimony would prove of considerable service, and many mines of quartz and antimony now abandoned would be beneficially worked. The Beautiful Venice Beef, between Bed castle and Staffordshire Flat, is highly remu nerative, also yielding 3 oz. to the ton. Clarke and Company's claim on the Wel come Beef yielded 5 oz. to the ton at a depth of 60 feet, and generally the whole of the reefs in this district may \"be said to be paying handsome dividends. Waranga Division, Bushworth. \u2014 Quartz reefing in this portion of the division is pro gressing very favorably. The average yields are good and give promise of a degree of permanency that, with increased population, improved and a more general use of machinery and a better system of mining, would raise it into prominence and importance. Many of the abandoned reefs in and around Bedcastle, if taken up by companies in large claims, and worked with good machinery, under proper management, would pay well The present cost of raising, carting, and crush ing, renders no stone, but that of a highly auriferous quality, remunerative. Sloane and party's claim on the South Nuggety Beef, from a late crushing of 53 tons, gave 1| oz. to the ton at a depth of 140 feet. It appears that a portion only of the gold produced at Bedcastle and its neighborhood finds its way to Melbourne by the Heathcote escort. The miners take it to Sandhurst, where a better price is obtained, and thus a large quantitv of gold fortnightly is added to the Sandhurst returns, at the expense of this district. Most of the claims on this line of reef have struck the water level at this depth and have ceased working. Messrs. Lazarus.

The machinery belonging to this company situated at the foot of Growler's Hill, is now being repaired and remodeled. About a fort night back the padlocks were forced off the ripple boxes, and the copper plates together with a large quantity of amalgam stolen. These amalgamators consist of two basins, the one stationary, the other revolving within it, driven by an engine of eight horse-power. They are said to work well. At Mr. Lewis's new claim on the Victoria Reef. 14 tons of stone yielded 2 oz. to the ton. The vein is from 2 to 3 set thick. Until within the last ten days an old shaft, sunk some time ago. was used, but it having been found unsafe the operations through that have been suspended, and a new shaft is being sunk nearer to where the vein has been again struck. Great quantities of rabble sandstone and refuse quartz which in the original workings of many of the claims, were thrown aside as of no value, have lately been crushed and given very handsome returns. Large fields of auriferous cement also lay unworked in the neighborhood of Rushworth and from the results obtained from such small quantities as have been already crushed, any enterprising person taking up a large area and working it with machinery fixed on the claim, would reap a rich reward for their investment of capital. On Chinaman's, sireen and Company are obtaining very good stone ; the vein is bnt 5 inches thick, and they are at present only some 30 feet deep, but the yield averages 8 oz. to the ton. Messrs. Lazarus, Fisher, and Tompany, Farquharson and Masterton, and Rooke and Touzean, have lately turned their attention to this branch of mining with some success. An abandoned claim on the Happy-go-lucky Reef, again taken up, is yielding very excel lent quartz.

The stamping machine of Messrs. Law and Company is not yet finished, but it is expected that the additional stampers will be completed in a very short time. The Albert Reef, on the Balaclava, although having already produced enormous quantities of gold, still continues at a depth of 340 feet, to remunerate its possessors. Mr. J. T. Lewis is about to erect a seven horse-power engine for lifting purposes, as at its present depth (340 feet) the labour of raising the stone to the surface is found to be too heavy for the employment of horses. The gold taken out of the Balaclava Hill is obtained from numerous small veins or leaders running east and west, at right angles to the ordinary strata, and varying in thickness from one-eight (J) of an inch to four and six inches. They are generally very rich, and evidently indicate the existence at a great depth of a main trunk reef of no ordinary size and richness.

Quartz reefing is the principal oc cupation of the miners, and but little trouble is taken with regard to the alluvial workings, no parties caring to prospect for new workings just now.

The miners never think of amal gamating their claims and working out of one shaft a large extent of ground, having effec tive machinery placed on it, and economising labor in every way by the application of steam power. On the contrary, the claims are all worked separately (generally two men to each claim) ; no system is adopted ; shafts are multiplied and sunk close together for the purpose of working the reef as it dips; and thus with labor badly applied, expensive crush ing and cartage, reefs which, in other places would be highly remunerative to the share holders, are abandoned as not being payable.

Maryborough Division. (1). O'Lcary, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Since last report, very little charge can be observed either in the amount or distribution of the population, and the usual steadiness both in quartz and alluvial mining has prevailed. The only noticeable features in the division are recorded below, the leads which are not named presenting nothing out of the usual course. Old Emeu Lead. \u2014 Three prospecting claims have recently been taken up in the vicinity of the old workings ; the first having, from the bottom of the shaft, 16 feet deep, yielded a 14 oz. nugget, together with some fine gold ; the second, at 12 feet deep, gave oz. to the load, with a prospect of improvement; and the third a prospect which would give an average of 3 oz 10 dwt. to the load. It is not im probable that this lead may again be discovered and worked towards the east and north. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 Adelaide Lead. \u2014 A small gully named by the prospectors Perseverance Gully has, after considerable labor on the prospectors' part, been found to be auriferous, giving them a return of 1 oz. to the load. The sinking is only 6 feet, and the gully is of inconsiderable extent. In the old workings in this section miners are employed with varied success. Chinaman's Flat\u2014 The Hit or Miss Com pany, whose claim (7 acres) is situate near the point on the lead, where there was too great a quantity of water to permit the ground being worked with the usual appliances, have suc ceeded in overcoming this impediment, and have reached the run of gold at a depth of 130 feet. The yield from the wash-dirt, which is 5 feet in thickness, is about 1 J oz. to the load ; this encouraging prospect has encouraged another engine party to take up a claim imme diately on the north side, and as the flat in the direction of the run extends about two miles, doubtless many other extended areas will be applied for, either under the mining leasing re gulations, or, under the local bye-law affecting wet alluvial sinking where steam machinery is required.

The following is the number of tons of cement crashed during the month : \u2014 Campbell and Company who possess the lease adjoining the Mount, have a 16 horsepower engine erected, with all the necessary winding gear, &c., attached; they are at present sinking their second shaft which is down 85 feet. Rouse and party in the lease adjoining have a horse whim erected, and are at present sink ing a new shaft on the supposed course of the lead; they are making up their party to the number required by their covenants, and are selling shares at \u00a3100 each; so soon as the party is made up they intend to erect steam machinery, From the Scandinavian and Rocky Flat Leads there is but little to report ; on the former lead the White Star Company have struck deeper ground than they were working before, and obtained a good prospect, but from the wet nature of the ground, are obliged to sink their shaft lower to enable them to put in a level that will reach the deep ground.

I have the honor to lay before you my report of the progress which the division has made in mining matters for the month of August. The Liverpool Rush near Mia Mia Flat, is on the wane; from the shallow aud easy nature of the sinking the claims were soon worked out. Several parties have left for the New Zealand goldfields, and daily numbers are migrating to other fields ; the population at present is about 1300. The prospects of the Mount Greenock Lead are still of a very satisfactory nature, although the population very slowly increases, which is in consequence of the expensive nature of the workings. Quartz Mining \u2014 In this branch of mining I have to report the discovery of a new reef named the Berlin, situated on one of the eastern ranges near the bottom of Nuggety Gully, Kan garoo Flat. The prospectors went into an old hole about 6 feet deep, and after driving 18 inches struck the lode, which proved to be 5 feet thick; in two days they raised 10 tons of stone taken indiscriminately, and bad it crushed, the yield was 11 oz. 10 dwt. 18 gr. During the month three block claims bottomed at an average depth of 85 feet, on what is considered the outskirts of the lead, and obtained in each case a prospect of I oz. to the load, with about 1 foot of wash-dirt. Nos. 1 and 2 amalgamated frontage claims attained a depth of 120 feet, and after doing all in their power, with a whim and three horses attached, found it quite impossible to bottom in consequence of the large body of water to contend with ; before relinquishing work, however, they raised to the surface some auriferous earth, composed principally of cement, much of the same nature as that found on the Scandinavian Lead, in which many specks of coarse gold were seen ; great hopes are entertained of this claim, but nothing definite will be known respecting it for some time, as the company which is known as the Black Ball, intend erecting a steam engine of 16 horse-power, with crushing machinery at tached. Nos. 3 and 4 amalgamated claim is down about 20 feet, and is situated at an elevation of at least 70 feet above Nos 1 and 2 ; the party expect to sink at least 200 feet A new reef has been discovered, termed the North Western, situated about four miles west of the reservoir, near the Ret-bet Creek; three tons of stone were crushed, at Mr. Bartlemore's machine, which yielded 2 ozs 9dwt. ; the depth at which the quartz was obtained, was 25 feet, and the thickness of the reef is from 2J to 3 feet. From the Star Reef, Amherst, 12 tons have been crashed which yielded 16 dwt. to the ton; present depth 30 feet; thickness of lode 2 feet.

The gold is rough and very little water-worn, from which circumstance the majority of the miners are of opinion that a quartz reef may be discovered in the immediate vicinity. (John S. Robertson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 With reference to alluvial mining in this immediate locality I may mention that appli cation has been made to have that portion of the lead in Grumblers' Gully, which (owing to the excess of water) has hitherto retarded the efforts of the miners, laid out under the front age system, the result of working under which regulation is looked forward to with much anxiety, and, if successful, I fully anticipate that this once rich and flourishing lead will be traced into ground deeper than has yet been worked in the district; and it is extremely probable that a junction may occur between it and the workings of New Year's Flat. The machinery is as follows With the exception of the Pyrenees Reef I may state that the result of the others has been obtained from the crushing of very small quantities, and no large amount of stone has as yet been raised from them. I append a few of these results. Bennett's Reef, 17 tons, yielded 24 oz. Cambrian Reef. 30 tons, yielded 30 oz. Richmond Reef, 27 tons, yielded 20 oz. 2 dwt.

The mining population has slightly de creased this month in consequence of the New Zealand fever, but only slightly, as the majority of the miners here are not inclined to leave their claims for such vague news as we have at present. When at Lamplough. some days since, I ascertained that the mining population at that place had literally dwindled down to five indi viduals. The quartz reefs in this division are still steadily progressing, and the yields from the principal reefs have maintained the average of last month. No applications for leases have been made during the past month.

Maxwell's Reef, No. 11 and 12 North, have had a crushing from quartz obtained at 90 feet, and the result has been a yield of 7J oz to the ton. This line of reef has been struck in various shafts, extending over a distance of 1500 feet, and varying in depth from 10 feet to 120 feet; and from the appearance of the quartz, and the uniform rate of the yield of gold, there is no doubt that for that distance the lode continues in one uninterrupted mass This reef in some places is between 30 and 35 feet wide, narrowing in places to 10 feet, which is the minimum thickness I have seen.

The German Reef, which has lately been crushing a network of reefs and leaders about 40 feet wide, together with all the intervening slate and rubble, have obtained very nearly 1 oz. to the ton from the whole mass, a result highly satisfactory, taking into consideration the facility with which it is obtained, and the quantity that can be put through a crushing mill. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Alluvial sinking in Inglewood has not been very prosperous this month. At Old Inglewood, however, the Deep Lead has considerably improved, several parties having bottomed ahead of those claims men tioned in my last, at between 140 feet and 150 feet, and obtained fully an ounce to the load, although the wash-dirt in this lead has not in creased in depth (being only five inches), the prospects of the lead look much brighter. The sinking is now getting very wet. Kingower, facetiously termed the \" Potatoe\" Digging, has again been supplying us with nuggets very freely. More than 300 lbs. weight of gold, in nuggets varying from 1 oz. to 25 lbs weight have been got this month, and at depths from 3 inches to 2 feet.

When I visited them they were working on the south end of hill, and at the depth of six feet had commenced to work a reef about nine feet thick, I succeeded in breaking off a few pieces of stone, in every one of which I discovered gold, both fine and coarse quence of a rush having taken place near Rostron's station, (Tottington). Some payable ground has been worked in the alluvial\", but the same run. or rather its continuation, seems problematical ; the depth has varied from surfacing to 10 and 12 feet sinking, with yields from 4 dwt to 1 oz. 3 dwt per load ; the gold in all instances being of good quality and nuggety. When I last visited this rush, distance 16 miles from St. Arnaud, I found the majority of the miners re-working the old ground, their mornings being occupied shepherding new ground, while their necessities compelled them in the afternoon to work the old. So general is this necessity that scarcely an inch of the solid shallow ground is left ; this leads one to suppose this rush will be of no great extent, as I am confident the new ground would be vigorously worked did it yield but 3 or 4 dwt. to the load. At Campbell's Creek, distance four miles S.E. from St. Arnaud, a small rush has taken place to one of the made hills which abound in this direction, the yield being 10 dwt. to the load ; depth of sinking, 20 feet ; wash-dirt, 6 inches ; depth of cement, 9 feet. Stuart's Hill.\u2014 So well known from its being the scene of the great mining dispute between Hoskins and Walker, is likely to earn still greater notoriety through its silver lode. A gentleman lately visiting St. Arnaud has tried several experiments with the ore, and has predicted a yield (if properly operated on) of from 40 to 60 per cent. ; he is about making arrangements with the present claimholders, and, if satisfactory, they will more fully develop the lode, and he will commence operations for the thorough extraction of the silver. Samples of the ore and metallic silver were forwarded by me some time since The St. Arnaud United Company. \u2014This company has had its first crushing, and from authentic information and from having seen the gold, I am enabled to report its average yield at a little over J oz per ton, which has given great satisfaction to the country share holders. From my knowledge of the ground I am sure much better stone could have been obtained ; their intention is to take any and every portion of quartz as it comes, instead of any one reef; even by this mode, I feel sure their yield will not fall below 10 dwt. per ton. Sebastopol\u2014 At last this splendid property is again going to be worked. Mr. Cameron has assured me the whole of the machinery will be delivered and on the ground in two months ; and particulars of same delivered to me, I think will be most efficient. Engine will be 40 horse-power Mining Association.\u2014 This company has applied for a lease of five acres, in the Mallee Scrub, situate N.E. 1\u00a3 miles from St. Arnaud ; their claim is situate on a steep hill, literally Chrysolite Hill. \u2014 Messrs. Eagar and Com pany have not yet crushed any stone ; the water in their shaft still continues a drawback. At the present time the reefs already dis covered in the immediate neighborhood of St. Arnaud, and which for some considerable time have been abandoned, are now nearly all occu pied, and from the energy displayed by some of the small companies formed on a few of them are likely to be well tried. For some time it has surprised me, why the reefs known to contain gold are here lying idle, when if they were in any other district in the colony they would be eagerly sought for and well tried. I have hitherto endeavored to draw attention to this, and from the number of strangers who have taken some of them up I feel I have partially succeeded, and without forfeiting my opinion when result was known, some have assured me they had no idea the presence of such reefs could be known and yet lay neglected. One of a party from Bendigo visited this place last week and immediately requested an area of three acres on which he says a crushing machine will be erected, and the party will work and crush the cement from the made hills at Peter's ; they intend erecting the machine and engine, &c , at the Middle Creek, distance six miles.

On the same hill, reef No. 1, Opie and Company, have nearly completed the erection of their machinery, the pump being now at work, so that very soon both these reefs will be workable below the water level. Another party of working miners, under the style of the Cornish United Mining Company, have applied for a lease on the Poverty Flat Reef, situate between the Cumberland and Nuggety Reefs, but a continuation of the latter.

Deichman's Reef, which years ago yielded 6 oz. per ton, is now re-occupied, as is also Englishman's, Barnes, and Victoria Reefs. I have the honor to report that mining operations generally continue to improve, the steady and very successful development of our quartz reefs inspiring greater, confidence and leading to more extensive and systematic op erations ; and notwithstanding the above tables show a considerable decrease in steam-power, and crushing machinery, caused by the removal of some of the unused machinery to districts more in need of such auxiliaries, we are really advancing, by better employing the power in use ; fixing the engines upon the reefs, and adding thereto pumps, for draining the mines. and at the same time furnishing a supply of that important element, water, to the boiler and crashing machinery. The Ajax Company continue to improve in their yield, and in their hands the Bolivia Reef is redeeming its auriferous character. This company of twenty tributers have followed the reef, which is 3 to 5 feet thick, 150 feet north and south of the shaft ; the whole of the material, quartz, slate, and sandstone, has yielded from 1 to 5 oz. of gold to the ton; they only worked three weeks during the past month, raising 215 tons which produced 1186 oz. of gold. The success of the Ajax Company at the north end of the hill, and the excellent pros- Prior's Sandstone Reef, in Wattle Gully, which has been allowed to lay in abeyance for the extra attractions of the Reservoir Reef, is again being worked; 9 tons crushed last week, yielded 35 oz. of gold, in which was a nugget of 3 oz. in weight. The White Horse, or Reservoir Reef, shows no decline in size or yield, two other claims have struck gold, averaging 1 oz. 2 dwt. per ton. In alluvial mining the greater portion of the puddling machines are being worked, and we are receiving an accession to this class of miners, from the Sandhurst District. Much of the old ground which has been worked and abandoned by Chinese, is being occupied and profitably worked by Europeans, who take advantage of the large water paddocks exca vated by the Chinese. Many miners possessing the necessary cash, are laboring under the New Zealand fever, and notwithstanding no reliable or extra ordinary accounts have been received there from, numbers are so infatuated as to leave a certainty for an uncertainty. The three portions of general plan required by you will be forwarded this week. Description. xt o fc fl\" <L \u00a3 fig S o Alluvial mining : \u2014 Steam engines ...

The following information has been obtained relative to the quantity of Quartz crushed during the month, and the Gold obtained therefrom : \u2014 Note. \u2014 Those who are crushing from the surface have not tiie means to follow the leads below the water level, and are consequently crushing the stone hitherto left or thrown away as refuse. Note. \u2014 ' The general aspect of my division is about the same as when I reported last month The only matter of importance is the discoveiy of a rich lead in Heron's Hill. In my last report I mentioned the fact of the gravel being struck ; I am now enabled to report that not only is Heron's Hill auriferous, but very considerably so. It is of basaltic formation, similar to Table Hill; the lead is about 130 feet below the trap; it will be therefore worked by means of tunnels driven from the Loddon frontage. The River Loddon runs at the foot of the hill, at about 220 feet below the table land. I have already surveyed ten frontage claims, and as soon as another of the tunnels shall have struck the lead. I anticipate a very considerable rush. There is ample room on the hill for 1000 miners; it is fully lj miles in length by about half a mile in breadth. in Dr. Malcolm's paddock. They are beginning to turn their attention to the creeks and rivers again as the spring advances. several of the large tunnelling parties around Kangaroo are sending one or two of their number to New Zealand to report on the prospects of the new gold field said to be discovered in that part of the world. Should their reports be favorable I anticipate losing many of our best and steadiest miners. The engines at Kangaroo and Vaughan are busily engaged night and day crushing cement aud tailings. The new plant of Odgers and Company (lately the property of the Emeu Company) is in full working order. Mr. Odgers informed me that the tailings and refuse thrown away in washing and sluicing will produce 2 dwt. to the ton, and that that produce will give the shareholders \u00a36 per week each. The Vaughan Gold Mining Company are very busy ; the manager informs me that the yields are highly satisfactory. The puddling interest is in a languid state just now as the season has been exceedingly wet; many claims are idle, and no applications have been made for new machines within the month. The prospector washed a tin dish of stuff in the presence of Mr. Warden Heron and myself, and the yield was 1 1 dwt. I myself picked four good sized specks of gold from a small piece of cement which the prospector threw from the dish while washing. I will endeavor to send you a tracing, fixing the position of the hill on the general map of the district, by next month. The Hard Hill rash is not progressing very favorably. There has been another small rush in the neighborhood; the prospector informed me that he was realizing 2 oz lo the load. Quartz mining operations are still very dull. The only addition during the month is the renewal of work by the Ferron's Reef Mining Company. This will engage a few hands, and may perhaps give an impetus to other reefs. The El Dorado Reef is one of the largest in my division, but nothing is being done there just now, in consequence of the El Dorado Pickpocket is still very dull.

A new reef has been opened near Middleton's Creek, and yielded J oz. to the tou, but I do not think much of it. Number of square miles of alluvial ground which is being or may have been actually worked upon, about 60. Number of distinct quartz reefs which have been actually proved to be auriferous to the present time, 62. Mr. Scotson is very busy crushing from the Mopoke Reef ; as will be seen, however, by the tabular statement attached, the yields have been anythin\" but satisfactory. The best yield I have to report is that of Martin and Company from the Frenchman's Reef; 20 tons yielded 48 oz. of gold. The plan to be forwarded this month will comprise the heads of Spring and Cobbler's Gullies, showing all the branches, reefs, &c.

Quartz mining in the Jim Crow portion of the division has not during the month past suffered any important change, but remains satisfactory as usual. Although the number of claims, from which actually payable quartz have been crushed, are rather limited still the average results are cheering and must of a necessity create and strengthen a confidence in quartz mining, for the lack of which whole lines of reefs are at present idle. Hepburn Division. (Ambrose Johnson, Mining Surveyor The population is as follows : \u2014 A number of reefs, now deserted, have been left off with prospects fully remunerative if worked on a large system and with machinery convenient, but parties are generally extremely cautious introducing machinery before the per manency of the reef and an extensive supply of gold-bearing quartz has been ascertained, and if during such prospect a slip in the lode occurs it is generally attributed to a common tendency of the Jim Crow Reefs to \" run out,\" and in most instances the undertaking aban doned as hopeless and unprofitable, whereas the failure might often more properly be traced to a certain want of faith or to inexperience on the part of the miners. As the principal reefs now working in Jim Crow I may mention: \u2014 Wombat Reef. \u2014 The Cornish party has been laying down tramway, completing their ma chinery, pumping, and otherwise been engaged with preparatory works, consequent upon their removal of machinery from Connell's Gully. They have during the month crashed a quantity of surface stone and refuse stuff on their claim, obtaining about a quarter of an ounce per ton. The company is now in working order, and operations under ground again resumed. The machinery is as follows South of this company a large claim has been taken up and a company to be called the \"Argus\" is in course of formation to work this ground by bringing in a tunnel from Smith's Creek. Specimens are reported to have been picked up on the surface, on several occasions, and the company has in my opinion a very good chance of success. North of the Cornish party Messrs. Pitt and Company, as also Grantfield and Company, are still prospecting, but no crushing has taken place during the month. Total value of all mining plant in the division, \u00a322,000.

A new reef is also reported to have beet discovered between Spring Creek and the head of Doctor's Gully, but I have not learnt with what prospect. Messrs. Addis and Company, in Camp-street, have made arrangements with Mr. W'ilson of Day Diggings to remove his machine to this claim, and are therefore stacking their quartz. About 200 tons, broken on contract at 9s. 3d. per ton, are now ready for crushing, and no visible change is taking place in the quality of quartz. Besides these reefs mentioned claims are working on most of the discovered reefs in Jim Crow, such as, for instance, Gray's Reef, Frenchman's Reef, Luther's Reef, Mauritzian's Reef, Doctor's Reef, Commissioner's Reef, and a number of others ; but although on some of them shafts are down a considerable depth, still the prospects have not been sufficient to induce the introduction of machinery, although in several cases large quantities of quartz have been found to average about 6 dwt. per ton. On Collier's Reef matters are also looking lively. Altogether about 1800 feet lineal are occupied on this line by seven different parties, of which, however, only two have as yet got payable gold. One of them, the Havelock Company, intend bringing in a tunnel from the foot of the hill to intersect all the different veins at a depth ; and the other party, Samp son and Company, have at a depth of 1 30 feet struck first-rate stone, clearly demonstrating the permanency of the reef. In Yandoit nothing of importance has occur red, a number of claims on the principal lines being down to water level, and transactions are in several cases pending to amalgamate a number of claims and procure the aid of machinery. Adams' New Reef, head of Old Tom, is looking as splendid as ever, but all quartz is being stacked untd Messrs. Adams and Com pany's engine is ready for crushing. Fourth shares in some of the claims are now being sold for \u00a31000. On Haggett's Reef, head of Blind Creek, the prospecting claim has changed hands, and the amalgamation with the Morning Star Company, so long contemplated, will probably soon come to a termination. Both claims have for some time been registered, and operations are only just resumed, hence I have no crushing to report. From Adelaide Reef, near Don't Waken, I learn that some of the southern claims at pre sent registered for excess of water are likely to be amalgamated, and from Claims No. 1, 2, and 3 South quartz is still being brought to grass, promising to pay as usual 2 or 3 oz. per ton, by a width of reef varying from a few inches to 3 feet. On Old German Reef, head of German Gully, the Goldsmiths' Quartz Mining Com pany have been crashing for some time, with what results I have not been able to learn, and a re-organisation of the company is spoken of likely to take place shortly. On Parker's Specimen Reef several shares have changed hands, and a company called the Prince Llewellyn Company is formed, and bringing machinery on the ground ; and, judg ing from the manner the company has com menced operations, I am persuaded that this fine reef will shortly maintain its position among the gold producing reefs of the division. On Trogish's Reef the prospecting claim has lately been registered, and the adjoining claims have followed the example. The pros pectiDg claim has occasionally produced pay able stone, and would probably pay well if a better system of working was adopted. On Glamorganshire Reef seven or eight claims are working, but only two or three are paying ; but the occasional splendid yields of the prospecting claim and No. 2 North keep the claimholders in continual high spirits. From the Sportsman's Reef I learn that a crushing in the early part of the past month yielded 5 oz. per ton, but since then I have heard of nothing of importance. On Hamburg Reef, a northern continuation of the Glamorganshire Reef, the only claims from which hitherto payable quartz has been raised \u2014 the prospecting claim and No. 2 South \u2014 have been registered for some time, pending the conclusion of arrangements for the intro duction of pumping and crashing machinery on the reef. On Beehive Reef things are prosperous as usual, and a claim has been taken up south of the prospectors', in which, however, the gold will probably have attained aconsiderabledepth. In the same locality a narrow vein has been discovered, cropping out on the surface, of which a first-rate prospect has been obtained, the gold being unusually compact and coarse This discovery is, however, so recent, that nothing definite can be said at present ; but it is expected that the vein found will lead to a defined reef. The rest of claims on the line, sinking in search of the lode, having one after the other attained the water level, they were also regis tered ; the registration of all such claims to expire on the 29th August."], [367, "345 MININQ SUEVEYOES EEPOETS \u2014 AUGUST. In the meantime claim No. 2 South, from which as much as 115 oz. per ton has been crushed during the early stage of its working, has been sold to the present proprietors of the prospecting claim, and it may therefore be expected that the valuable aid of machinery will soon enable the search for the reef at a depth to be prosecuted. in the workings, and, in most cases, the result answers all reasonable expectations. On Italian or Hard Hill, Wombat Creek, about 1000 feet frontage have been taken up, on a supposed continuation of a gutter worked in Francesco Cereses and Company's lease, and tunnels started at a lower level than any hitherto in Italian Hill. On the Great Reef the Great Reef Company have during the month been at a stand, with the exception of crushing one lot of cement and one lot of quartz. On Hard Hill, Stony Creek, three tunnels have now broken into the gutter, and have began washing, but I have not been able to ascertain the result. On the Pioneer Reef the Pioneer Company (leasehold) are getting their engine and battery erected, sinking an engine shaft, and bringing quartz from the original workings to the sur face ; and I believe that the quartz is showing as well as heretofore. The rest of the claims are all registered, or working above water level, until the Pioneer Company's engine shall have commenced operations. Table Hill, and most of the basaltic hills along Sailors' Creek and Doctors' Gully, are fully occupied, and most of the parties are making fair average wages. In the northern portion of Elevated Plains, between Breakneck and the Excelsior hotel, five tunnels are going ahead across the old workings, for a supposed back gutter, and a few months more will determine whether such a gutter exists, or where the junction has been effected. Besides these, claims are being prospected on Clement's Reef, Homeward Bound, Finlay son's Reef, and a number of others all over Yandoit ; but the prospects, although encour aging, have only in one case amounted to \\ oz. per ton. Between Shepherd's Flat and Franklinford one tunnel in Moore's Gully, prospecting for the northern continuation of the Elevated Plains lead, has struck a narrow lead, occa sionally yielding 2 or 3 dwt. per tub. and it is expected that the main lead cannot be far distant ; the rest of the tunnels prospecting for the same lead have therefore resumed, with renewed vigor, and I trust their perseverance will shortly be rewarded. Puddling and sluicing have during the past month been uninterrupted, and the proceeds, as far as I can learn, eveiy way satisfactory. Although fair wages may be considered the average, still claims paying \u00a31 per day and upwards are not so scarce as would be imagined, when it is considered that nearly all the ground at present in work has been opened for years, and been commanded by races these last three or four seasons. On the Township's Lead, Daylesford, Messrs. Spence and Company's tunnel have broken into the gutter, after about 800 feet cutting, but the tunnel 'will be too shallow to work the deepest end or northern portion of the claim, and they have therefore altered the course of the tunnel so as to meet the depth of the gutter near their southern boundary. The adjoining party, Messrs. Salmon and Company, have commenced a new tunnel, the first one being too shallow to drain the gutter in their claim. The only new ground taken up for puddling and sluicing during the last month has been about the head of Old Tom Gully, Cham pagne, and the surrounding gold workings in the western portion of Jim Crow. At Red Gully, for instance, about 5 acres of shallow ground and surface has been taken up, and a race been cut to the ground from Sailors' Creek above the Sailors' Creek Fall, and I have very little doubt that, attention being directed towards that portion of the division, and with the additional facility offered by the race just mentioned, a large area of ground will be found remunerative in that direction. At Yandoit several claims have been taken up on the Bald Hills, west of Yandoit Creek. The ground has nearly all been prospected before, and gold been found, but no additional discovery has taken place as yet. In Glengower, on Deep Creek, four extended claims have been taken up on a hill rushed about two years ago. At that time a number of tunnels were started, and although some very pretty nuggets were found, still no defined lead was discovered, and the rush therefore gradually subsided. Tunnelling is favorably progressing, although no new ground of any extent has been opened. Most of the claims taken up during the month have been in old abandoned ground, but large heaps of refuse headings left as valueless at the mouth of tunnels, after the first working. having been found to pay well for sluicing or puddling, it was anticipated that large quanti ties of stuff equally remunerative yet remained I have been informed that, during the last month, a bag of stuff from one of the old tun-"], [368, "346 MINING SUEVEYOES EEPOETS AUGUST. nels yielded about \u00a350 worth of gold ; but such report is probably exaggerated. Alluvial sinking has during the monlh past presented a rather brisker appearance than for some time has been the case. All claims bot tomed on the Township's Lead, Daylesford (private property), have, as usual, paid \u00a3S 10s., and upwards, per man each week. In Mr. Kirwan's paddock the Emerald Gold Mining Company are in so far certain of deep ground, and are erecting a whim, the water proving too heavy for hand baling. sionally, but only four or five claims have as yet obtained gold of any consequence. In Welcome Gully a second rush has set in, and during the last week finds of 48 and 37 oz. nuggets been reported, but I cannot vouch for the correctness of the statement. I have not visited the locality lately, and must there fore defer particulars until my next report. An extended claim has been taken up by Messrs. Laidlow and Company, at the junc tion of German Gully and Blind Creek, and the party has started a tunnel below the claim, to meet the bed-rock at the lower boundary, so as to drain the ground, of which, if the water can be drained, a very favorable opinion is generally entertained. The Wombat Hill Gold Mining Company, in the police paddock, have sunk their shaft some 70 feet deep in basaltic rock, but are also compelled by water to suspend operations, and the company calculating upon working the paddock for years, a steam engine will at once be erected. The lead is now traced almost to the fence, both above and below the paddock, and shares are therefore at a high premium. In Shicers' Gully, Yandoit Creek, a number of shafts have been sunk, but the prospectors are as yet the only party getting gold in remn nerative quantity. The Grand Junction Company, on Yandoit plains, have bottomed at about 100 feet, and are reported to have got a first-rate prospect. A small portion of trial stuff was sluiced last week, but the yield has not come to my know ledge. At Champagne Gully some pretty good ground has been opened recently on the west ern bank of the gully, but whether it will prove a distinct lead cannot be said at present.

The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Bell-topper Reef. \u2014 Four claims are being worked at on this reef: all parties seem san guine of success under the consideration of the. improvements which are being made to the steam crushing-machine.

A new reef has been struck in the engine shaft, at a depth of 160 feet, which looks very promising, At Pickpocket, not much has been done since the late floods ; a great number of the diggers have left some for Nuggety Flat and others for the Western I Mggings. The returns from the Washing Company's are nil, their time having been employed during the past month clearing their workings from the effects of the flood. The same state of stagnation has occurred along the Jim Crow Creek and the Loddon, between Strangways and Newstead. Numbers are waiting for the summer to set in before resuming operations. The Eaglehawk Union Company's plant on the same reef is in full work, and the returns as shown on the annexed table as the proceeds of eight days' crushing ; the machinery works admirably at present. The South Liscotts Association's ground is still giving good returns; this has been one of the most steadily paying reefs on Tarrangower, and promises to be a constant dividend-paying mine. One thousand six hundred loads have been washed by the Maldon Gold Washing Company which have produced 50 oz. 10 dwt. Twenty nine men have been employed during the month. The defalcations of the director of some of our mining companies here has greatly depre ciated ihe value of mining property, and amongst the sufferers may be mentioned the North Liscott's Company, however it is hoped that the liabilities will be liqiudated within a few months. The purchaser of the Porcupine Company's plant and ground has not yet commenced operations. The Beehive Company's ground is still steadily improving and the reef in the deep ground bids fair to give good returns. The owners of puddling machines have plenty of water and are very busily engaged at present; a good number of them are earning average wages. Nine new puddlers' extended claims have been granted this month. Isaacson's Claim on this reef has been paying well for some time, the average yield being 1 oz. to the ton. Quartz Mining \u2014 The yield of the South Eaglehawk Company has decreased con siderably of late, so much so that it has ceased crushing operations and called for tenders for working the mine on tribute, and hopes are Vivian and Company are at present engaged in erecting some new machinery and will be ready to commence operations in about five weeks.

The population is as follows : \u2014 partially worked alluvial ground, and to the recently discovered auriferous gullies of the division ; and, so far as I can learn, the average yield of gold per man per week is rather below 5 J dwt. But the yield of gold to each individual being as unequal as its distribution in the ground, many of the miners are not obtaining sufficient to pay for their food. However, it is to be hoped that when the weather becomes less inclement than it has been of late, pros pecting will be successfully resumed in the numerous gullies of this division that are as yet untried by the miner. As regards quartz mining, I am sorry to have to say that I cannot report any improve- ment in tins branch of mining, which ought to be the principal one in this division, seeing that we have no less than 37 quartz reefs, all of which are known to be auriferous, but which, from the inefficient and tedious manner in which they have been worked heretofore, could not yield a payable return unless the yield of gold per ton was very great indeed. The mode of raising quartz in this division is (with a few exceptions) by working the whole length of a claim from the surface down ; thus involving a very great amount of unnecessary, and there- fore unprofitable labor in taking up all the headings to the surface, and also in timbering (such as it is). By this mode of working the amount of unnecessary labor increases as the thickness of the vein diminishes ; so that a thin vein, which being properly worked, and yielding handsomely for the capital and labor expended, would, by this mode of working, yield no re turns to the capitalist, nor even wages to the miner. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The workings of the Smythe's Creek Mining Company on Swedish Reef, One Tree Hill, are now at a depth of 200 feet in one of their shafts, and, contrary to the theories of experienced miners, the veiu has increased in thickness from 6 to 15 inches, and the quartz to be much richer than it is at a depth of 100 feet. The yield of gold per ton is not known as yet, as none of the quartz taken out at this depth has been crushed yet. Total value of all mining plant in the division, \u00a36730. Number of square miles of alluvial ground which is being or may have been actually worked upon, 15.

The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 15s. to \u00a33 15s. 6d. per oz. All the crushing machines on this gold field are idle at present, and the whole of the quartz crushed during the month amounts to but four tons. The You You Mining Company is involved in litigation, and their mining operations sus pended until a decision is made by the Court of Mines as to the ownership of the claim. I have the. honor to state, for your informa tion, that during the month of August mining matters have not been progressing in this divi sion at the same rate as in the four months preceding. Prospecting, which was carried on with considerable energy, and attended with some success, during the months of April, May, June, and July, seems now to be all but aban doned. The operations of the miners are entirely confined to the previously worked or I herewith forward sheet No. 27, it being a plan of part 1st of Back Creek, which I intend to continue, for the purpose of connecting the surveys of the tributary gullies of that creek already made, and also to fix points along its banks with which to connect future surveys.

I have not been able to obtain any reliable information relative to the quantity of quartz crushed during the month. The proprietors have promised to give full particulars in future. Quartz Mining \u2014 The Campbell's Reef Pio neer Quartz Mining Company have had a small quantity of stone crushed, which has yielded very poor returns. Alluvial Mining. \u2014 The prospects of alluvial mining in this division are improving. The Horse Shoe Tunnel Company, on the Canton Lead, are doing very well, averaging from 4 to 5 oz. to the machine. Other tunnel companies on this lead are paying very well. There is a probability of a company being formed for working the prospector's claim at Commissioner's Hill, on an extensive scale : they purpose having steam puddling and crushing machinery. I have no doubt that within a circle of three miles from Ararat there are very large areas of ground that would give highly remunerative employment to parties able to erect a small steam engine for crushing the vast deposits of cement. I hope in my next month's report to be able to furnish a more detailed report of mining matters in this division. ARARAT MINING DISTRICT. Ararat Division. (John Usher, jun., Mining Surveyor.)

The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 14s. 9d. to \u00a33 16s. 6d. per oz. During the past month a number of claims have been bottomed at the Silver Shilling Hill, and from several good cement is being obtained; the yield varies from 2 oz. to 8 oz. to the ton, and in addition to these returns from mills, the owners of some of the claims have washed out good patches from small quantities of cement and wash-dirt. The ground proved to be payable is not of great extent ; the number of claims giving remunerative returns does not exceed 20, but the whole of the vacant ground between the old Mia Mia Flat and Sebastopol Leads has been taken up, and is being vigor ously prospected. On the Pour- Posts there is little of import ance to record, the miners located there are principally, occupied in the neighborhood of old workings. At the wet sinking, Old Deep Lead, a piece of ground has been marked out for a lease. This part of the lead was abandoned more than two years ago, in consequence of the claimholders not being able at that time to get the necessary machinery erected for pumping out the water. The reduction in the price of crushing since that time will enable parties to raise cement and wash-dirt, which was formerly abandoned as unprofitable. (In the reefs nothing worthy of note has taken place during the month ; some of the crushing mills have not been fully employed.

In consequence of a misunderstand ing between the sluicers and puddlers about the water right, and the race proprietors having raised the weekly rent charged to a smaller sluicing company, who derived the water from their dam. a movement has been set on foot, to memorialize the Honorable the Commissioner of Mines to purchase the races on public account ; under the present system, the holders of water rights are enabled to increase the rate charged for water, at a week's notice, whenever they find that the smaller parties are making good returns, thereby compelling their tennants to pay a tribute rather than a rent. and leaving them no alternative but to submit to their terms or abandon the ground they have prospected. The rush to Otago has attracted a small portion of the mining population of this di vision, but the exodus is fully counterbalanced by fresh arrivals from Brown's, Linton's, and Camgham : I may mention that the accession of labor, capital and machinery, from those places would be much larger but for the want of confidence engendered in the minds of a large proportion of the miners engaged in deep sink ing, by the absence of a system of registration in this division. fortnight since and one of the shareholders lost his life by an accident whilst getting the pipes up. The remainder of the party are sinking a new shaft, and have taken up part of the ground recently occupied by the Cockatoo Company. The ground recently held by Gutch and party (Reservoir Company) is unworked at present. The Champion of the Seas Company are making but poor returns, little more than 1 oz, to the machine : and the West of England Company are about to draw the slabs and abandon their claim as it has proved non-remu nerative. The Royal Standard Company have mastered the water, and are proceeding with their main drive. The Garibaldi or Prospectors' Company are again getting good dividends : they puddle the wash-dirt and sluice the headings. The Olive Branch Company have washed their first ma chineful of wash-drift, with a result which indicates at least good wages to the working shareholder. The Great Republic Company's claim has produced but small results ; the engine employed is far too small to work the claim to advantage. On the Main Lead, the Britannia Company and the Beaufort Company have recently bottomed their respective shafts and will shortly employ machinery. The New Allandale Com pany's claim, in the Police Paddock, has a shaft sunk to the main drift. The Old Allandale Company's claim is again in work, but has not yet yielded any return. The Golden Age Com pany's claim is still in operation with no better result. The Fiery Creek Company have driven past a run of ground on the reef that will pay wages ; they are following the, dip of the rock from their new shaft, and expect to cross the gutter next month. The Marco Polo Company had their opera tions delayed last week by one of their drives giving way, but they had netted the handsome sum of \u00a3300 during the previous fortnight. They are not, however, at work in the Main Lead gutter, as their engine has proved too light to drain it as yet. The Flying Buck Company are erecting an engine. The Raglan Company's dividends vary from 10 to 12 oz. weekly. The Chinese Whim Holes, about the junc tion of Close's Lead, continue to pay well. The puddlers and sluicers about the junction of Jonathan's Gully, and thence to the head of the lead, are all doing well, more particularly the Dancing Feather and Ph\u0153nix Sluicing Companies. The Ph\u0153nix derive a weekly in come of \u00a3 1 7 1 0s. from the rent for their sur plus water. A small rush has taken place during the month to a locality known as Tom Bolton's Gully, situate between Unity and Sailor's Leads, and just outside Mr. John Simson's paddock. The depth of sinking is 42 feet, the wash-dirt is thin, and the lead only 12 feet wide. The few loads washed by the prospectors averaged about 1 oz. per load; the gold is of a nuggety description, and I was shown several pieces weighing from 1 to 27 dwt.; there are abont 50 miners at work there, and as three or four claims above and below the prospectors have obtained from 10 to 15 dwt. to the load, and a puddling machine being erected, there will probably be an increased population shortly. A little below the prospectors, water has been struck and the lead appears to be trending towards Unity Gully. In the adjacent gullies the population and yield of gold is much the same as last month. The Southern Cross Lead fully maintains its crotchety character ; and claims that yield 1 6 oz. one week, only yield 4 oz. the next. The Prospect claim and the Royal Saxon Company are carrying on their main drives with great vigor and employ hired labor in addition to that of the shareholders. The Prince of Wales Company have ob tained 1 J dwt. to the tub at a depth of 112 feet, and are about to obtain and erect an engine next month. On Ding-dong and McCook's Leads there is nothing new to report, except that the pros pectors on the former have sunk a new shaft for greater convenience of working, and the On the Garibaldi, or New Jock's, the Sham rock and Thistle Company lost their shaft a"], [376, "354 MINING SUEVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 AUGUST, late proprietors of No. 3 South, who are bound to the New Zealand El Dorado, have disposed of their claim to Chinese for \u00a385.

Sulky Flat is being re-worked, with satis factory results. Surface Hill still gives remunerative em ployment to a sluicing company Shicer Gully and Perseverance Gully give remunerative occupation to a number of tub and cradle men. At Waterloo Hill and Surface Point the three sluicing companies engaged on those localities are getting good wages. At New Musical a party has been at work for some time past, getting 12 oz. to the machine. The Queen of England Company recently took up the adjoining ground, and have sunk a shaft, and obtained a good pros- pect by driving, and are about to erect an engine. At Paddy's Gully, the prospectors (just below the Queen of England Company) have bottomed their new shaft, obtained a pay able prospect, and made arrangements for machinery. At New Jonathan's Gully the Prospect Claim is re-occupied by a new company. Ooe or two other claims are again at work. Eaglehawk Gully gives small wages to a few tub and cradle men and one puddling machine At Charcoal Gully the Princess Eoyal Company have bottomed a shaft on the reef, at 8 1 feet, and intend to drive for the gutter at a level of 90 feet.

Since the date of my last report, I have to state that notwithstanding the late excitement caused by the reported richness of the New Zealand gold field, mining operations have progressed very favorably and with remunera tive results to the various companies engaged in the actual work of gold raising in this division. The foregoing statistical table will show a slight decrease in the mining population, but it cannot be supposed that this has inter fered to any material extent with the operations, nor has it tended to lessen the yield for the past month, as labor is tolerably plentiful and at very moderate wages ; the highest being about \u00a33 per week for eight hour shifts. In referring to the condition of the different leads, the various companies so frequently reported as being engaged in sinking operations are still continuing those operations, and are making all the headway that can be expected in the very tedious process of deep lead mining. Company ; you will see by the foregoing table that out of 650 tons of quartz crushed during the month, the yield has been 303 oz , which is regarded by the company as a very encour aging yield. I forward plans and sections of their underground workings, you will see by the sections that the reef is of an extraordinary large size If it continues to yield as present prospects would seem to warrant, the company may reckon on many years of remunerative labor. I think all the necessary explanations regarding the reef and stratification are shown on the drawing. No. 3 Division. (Thomas Cowan, Mining Surveyor.)

The greatest effect has been manifested amongst the quartz mining companies, several of which have altogether ceased work, not withstanding that they have erected expensive machinery. Three companies in my district, which have been at work for some time and have an ex tensive plant, have totally ceased work for the present ; but I have reason to believe that now the rush has ceased operations will be resumed. The returns obtained by many of the quartz companies have not of late been very satisfac tory, and this has tended to render the eager ness of the shareholders greater to try a new gold field, in hopes of realizing a larger sum of money than they had a prospect of obtaining by continuing at their ordinary work. As. however, the rush to New Zealand may now be considered at an end, the various com- panies will probably again prospect their ground, and it is not unlikely with better re sults than have hitherto been obtained. The effect of the rush has not been so great on the alluvial miners, but I have heard of one or two instances which show how the men are affected by what may be called a temporary mama One company working an alluvial claim sold their claim to nine Chinese for \u00a3 1 50, notwith standing that the last weekly dividend had been \u00a37 per man, and all made preparations to start for New Zealand. The unfavorable news, however, deterred many of them, who now bitterly repent their having been led away by the glowing reports of the rush. This instance, which came within my own knowledge, may serve as a type of many others, and show how little discretion is used in such cases I regret to report that the returns from the various quartz mining companies are not so favorable as for previous months.

Several companies have spent much time and labor in prospecting their claims, and one, the Canadian Company, has sunk a shaft to the depth of 190 feet, and only obtained about 12 grains to the ton. This, of course, has greatly discouraged the shareholders, but it is to be hoped that better results will yet be obtained. As a counterpoise to these unfavorable returns, I may mention that several quartz mining companies continue to obtain highly satisfactory results, and express great confidence in the paying nature of their claims In alluvial mining I have no change to report, beyond the abandonment or sale of some few claims in consequence of the rush to New Zealand. disastrous effects of the explosion than any written description, for the eye will'be able to take in at one view the full extent of the damage. My principal reason for referring in detail to the accident is, to arouse the attention of miners to the danger which they are daily incurring. At the present time, in almost all companies, implicit faith is placed in the gauge glass, and so long as that remains full, no danger is even apprehended From the evidence taken at several\" inquests here, and from my own experience, I am of opinion that the glass should be trusted but to a very limited extent. Where dirty or salt water is used, the communicating pipe fre quently gets stopped, and the boiler appears to be very nearly full when in reality it is but little more than empty : beyond this, I am of opinion that companies are not sufficiently careful in choosing engine drivers. I have been informed that the engine driver at the East India Cement Company was a mason by trade ; he had only had experience of one engine before, and, though a steady man, was not a competent one. The consequence seems to have been that he depended entirely upon the glass-gauge, and continued to heap on firewood when there was scarcely any water in the boiler : the result was, that the instant the engine was set in motion the explosion took place It remains to be considered whether it might not be advisable to legislate for the prevention of similar accidents. I regret to have to report that an accident of a more than usually fatal description has taken place during the last week. By the bursting of the boiler used by the East India Cement Company, on the Eureka, four men have been killed and three seriously wounded, one of whom is not expected to survive many hours. I deem it necessary to call particular attention to this accident, because it surpasses in the fatality of its results any that has yet happened in Ballaarat, or indeed in any mining district, and because it may serve as a warning to many mining companies who hitherto have been very lax in choosing men to drive their engines. There is a belief too prevalent amongst miners, that no great amount of experience is required to drive an engine properly, and that the office of engine driver can be adequately fulfilled by almost any person of ordinary in telligence This belief has already led to serious acci dents, by which lives have been lost and an immense amount of property destroyed, and I therefore deem it highly necessary that special attention should be called to the subject. In order that the nature of the last accident may be understood. I forward a plan, showing the state of the claim immediately after the accident had occurn d. I am of opinion that the only way to stop the recklessness now shown is by throwing a greater responsibility upon the companies generally ; but whether such an end can be attained by an Act of Parliament is a matter for the consideration ot others. No. 4 Division. (Michael O'Malley, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 It will be seen that the explosion must have been one of unusu d force, as the boiler has been thrown a distance of 1 7 1 feet to the south, and a portion of the tube to a distance of 85 feet to the north . The brickwork in which the boiler was set was scattered in all directions, and one man \u2014 the engine driver \u2014 was thrown into the dam marked A, a distance of 270 feet from the spot on which he was standing when the explosion occurred The two ends of the boiler were torn out round the rivets, aud the tube was twisted and crumpled up as if it had been a piece of paper.

Paddy's Gully, and immediate neighborhood are nearly deserted. Whim Holes and neighborhood continues dull enough. I believe there are only two or three companies realizing anything like fair returns, if however, the cement which is being crushed by the Heart and Hand Company should turn out well, very likely the place will soon again become the scene of some bustle and excitement. The returns hitherto obtained therefrom has been tolerably good and are ex pected to improve. At Little Hard Hills, two small companies are also obtaining rather remunerative returns from their cement, though as yet their system of extracting the gold from it is of a most pri mitive and tedious nature, viz. : by calcining it when broken into lumps about 2 or 3 !b. in weight, and placed on an open kiln or paddock, and afterwards crushing it in a mortar-like vessel termed a Berdan.

The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 18s. 6d. to \u00a33 19s. One company, however, is about procuring a small stamping battery, which will, I am satis fied enable them to realize double their present returns, which even under the present system averages from \u00a34 to \u00a35 per man weekly. Deep Leads. \u2014 Frenchman's and White Horse. \u2014 The several companies on these leads, with one or two exceptions are still either sink ing or driving in search of the gutter or gutters, for it is generally considered, in fact it is now proved that a second lead or gutter is traversing this locality, and likely to run through the claims of the Defiance and Nelson Companies. The former company, after having worked out their old claim on Frenchman's Lead, some four or five months since, determined on prospecting for a new lead to the southward of their shaft, and after having put in a level to the extent of about 370 feet in a south-west direction they struck a new gutter quite dissimilar both as to the color and general appearance of its stuff from that of the old Frenchman's ; and, moreover, the level at n-hich it was struck is some 20 feet higher than the level which the Frenchman's would have attained at the place referred to, so that from these facts there is no doubt but a new lead has been discovered, and one that promises to pay handsomely. So confident are the Defiance Company of the paying nature of the ground that they have recently purchased the claim of an adjoining company (called the Prospecting Claim) for \u00a31000, although this per oz. During the last month there has been a con- siderable rush to a place known as Montrose Hill, in the vicinity of Bull Dog, which I am happy to say is affording fair wages to some 350 to 400 \"persons located there; and in a few cases highly remunerative returns are being obtained \u2014 for instance some 20 claims are yield- ing as high as from 1 oz. to 4 oz. per load, while in one instance as much as 18 oz. per load has been obtained from wash-dirt 2\u00a3 feet in depth. The sinking is quite dry, and varies from 13 to 30 feet, through hard stiff clay, cement, and gravel. Another small rush has occurred during the month at the East India Lead, about half a mile south of the Little Hard Hills, where several claims are paying pretty well. The sinking here also is shallow and the ground patchy. Break o'Day Hill has not turned out quite as well as was anticipated ; yet it has yielded a good deal of gold Hall and Company have already realized \u00a31,200 from their claim, but this is \"far the best on the hill. The lead is now proved to be running through Mr. Elder's pro- perty, and many persons are anxious to treat with him for permission to mine thereon. However, the Messrs. Grant are as yet the only persons who have obtained that permission. They have leased one acre on the boundary of Crown land, but have not yet struck gold. Description. M fc. = 5 CT 3 la V K c.

The Defiance Company, however, have got very good prospects in their own ground. and as their old claim will be very considerably augmented by their recent purchase the future prospects and success of the company are thought highly of. The Nelson Company, though registered for the Frenchman's Lead, are supposed by many to be presently working in the new gutter above referred to, which is expected to junction with Frenchman's in the neighborhood of their shaft, and from the similarity of their stuff to that recently got up by the Defiance Company, it is quite likely that such is the case. A few more months, however, will decide this matter, and also set at rest the much agitated question as to the future course of the Ballaarat deep leads, the prevailing opinion presently being in favor of a down-creek or southward course. The Camp Company have been obtaining about the usual returns during the month; their last fortnightly dividend was \u00a330 per man. This company have recently discovered a promising tributary gutter while working the eastern portion of their claim, which is con sidered to be the old Lord Raglan, and on which they have taken up an extended area of 1 000 by 300 feet in the direction where the old lead was traced to some two or three years since. The Alston and Weardale, and Bonshaw Companies, the former on Crown land, the latter on private property, are still driving for the Crawfish or Prospect Lead, and in conse quence of the extreme hardness of the reef or bed rock they are making but slow progress, 12 feet per week being as much as the former company have been able to get through during the last five months They, however, expect as they approach the gutter that the reef will become softer, and that in about three months hence they will reach the long sought for goal. The Scottish and Cornish Company, Black Lead, are still engaged with the erection of their new plant and machinery, which, when completed, promise to be equal to the best in the district. The Working Miners' Company have been very much baffled this time back by a heavy quicksand drift, struck at a depth of about 374 feet in their shaft, and supposed to overlie the gutter, and after fruitlessly endeavoring during the last three or four months to get through it in the ordinary course of sinking (the skillful and unskillful hands being mixed up together) they have finally decided on letting the sinking by contract at \u00a312 per foot to some of their own shareholders, who, if experienced men, will I have no doubt realize very liberal wages thereat. Cobbler's. \u2014 The Prince of Wales Company are still engaged putting in a level for the Cob bler's gutter, which they expect to reach at about 600 feet in a N.E. direction from their shaft.

The shareholders are now pre paring their drives so as to enable them to use horses underground. The gutter in this claim is proven to be 1 60 feet wide ; in some places the trap rock is so close on the primitive reef that the thickness of wash-dirt is less than two feet, and the company will be necessitated to break up a considerable depth of reef, in con sequence of which the progress of the drives is but slow.

No. 6 Division. (John Lynch, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 I have the honor to transmit the following report of the state of mining in this division, No. 6, Ballaarat, for the month of September, 1861 : \u2014 The quartz reef, near WTiybrow's Gully, dis covered last July, and referred to in my report for that month promises well ; the prospectors have now over 60 tons of stone raised which shows gold in abundance. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 No. 1, South, have struck a very rich lode about a fortnight ago ; they are now into the main reef, and it shows equally as well as the prospecting claim. The very many failures which have attended quartz mining hitherto in this part of the district, operates rather injuriously on that branch of mining, as I fail to perceive at the present time that eagerness in engaging in it which used to be so manifestly displayed in the like ventures on former occasions. In addition to this the rush to New Zealand has contributed to bring about this undesirable indifference, but as that illusion is fast disappear ing, I expect before another month to find every claim fully manned.

At Italians some of the claims are looking very well ; the All Nations had during the month, 150 oz., which gave about \u00a37 per man per week. The Prince of Wales continues to give from \u00a36 to \u00a310 per man. On Smythesdale fiat the Morning Light claim has been worked out ; it has paid the company very well for nearly two years. The Kossuth is given up, being worked out ; the Emeu and White Star are making wages. The Pioneer Company are getting from \u00a34 to \u00a35 per man weekly, the Britannia about \u00a33, and Surprise about \u00a34 weekly. The Star of the North are sinking a new shaft. The Waterloo Company are sinking a new shaft, they have passed through the rock and are into a drift. The Perseverance and Band of Hope making fair wages. The prospectors of the Red White and Blue are sinking a new shaft. The machinery on Capt. Finn's Reef is nearly erected. The Great Western had only \u00a34 per man last week, hut this is no criterion of the value of the claim, as they have much better ground to work. The Scotchman's Reef has been hitherto a failure, there has been a heavy outlay incurred in the machinery and woiking of this claim, and the return obtained is such as will in all likelihood lead to its abandonment. The Beaumont Company had a small divi dend last week; this claim which has proved well from its commencement is nearly worked out. At Camgham there is not much change. The Sherwood Company are getting about \u00a310 each weekly ; Great Britain from \u00a34 to \u00a36 ; Bedfordshire and Magnum Bonum about \u00a33 ; Telegraph and Red Lion next to nothing. No new alluvial ground has been lately struck there. On the quartz reef the Britannia claim is the only one at present at work, and it is paying very well, the average being about 17 dwt. to the ton. The Caledonia claim paying very well, I have been informed that it has averaged \u00a35 a week from the commencement, which is a return unusually good. The Reliance Company at Scarsdale is im proving greatly, they had last week 108 oz. to thirty-two men. Smythe's and Brown's Junction has been rather moderate lately, the same may be said of the Golden Gate. The Cairngorm Company have given up work for some time back. Linton, Lucky Woman's, and Spring Dal lah. \u2014 This portion of the district is again rapidly recovering from the stagnation occa sioned by the New Zealand rush, the effects of which pervaded every department of trade and business as well as mining enterprise. For some time mining property was disposed of for one-half its value, but a reaction has set in within the last few days ; shares have risen to the old standard of prices as rapidly as they fell, and in a few days matters will assume their wonted appearance. The Cr\u0153sus are getting about \u00a310 per man, and Washington from \u00a36 to \u00a310. The Lord John Russell is yielding pretty fair returns. The Red Hill and Mines Royal claims are poor. The Hand-in-Hand expect every day to be into the gutter. The Grand Junction is into paying ground. On Linton Proper most of the companies are getting well paid. Budgeon's Flat and Brown's old lead are in about the same condition as they were in last month. The Britannia Company, better known as No. 4 Block, washed 42 oz last week from one and a half machines ; there are only twelve men in the company, and for the last six weeks they have got 32 oz. per week. The British Workman Quartz Reef is averaging 6 dwt. to the ton ; this is the only quartz claim paying about Brown's. The Lancashire Reef, Monkey Gully, is in a most depressed state ; not so the alluvial claims in that place, the Prince of Wales averaging from \u00a38 to \u00a39 \u2014 they hive found a new gutter which promises to excel the old one ; the Havelock is turning out \u00a38 a week per man ; the Falcon, good wages ; and Cambrian have got a good prospect in their new shaft. The Time-will-tell Company and Catch-me if-you-can Company are not doing so well as formerly, their dividends being only \u00a33 per man weekly. The Redan and Glanmorgan Companies are doing about the same as the last-named two companies. b2"], [388, "364 MINING SUEVEYOES' REPORTS \u2014 SEPTEMBER. s gutter. The prospect was 8J dwt. to three buckets of wash-dirt. The Edinburgh has averaged 82 oz. per week for the last three months. The Duke of Cornwall, adjoining the south west boundary of the Edinburgh, are doing but poorly bat they are reducing the number of shareholders When their arrangements are completed they will be able to earn fair wages The Don Juan abuts on the Albion, it is not yet bottomed, although deeper than the Ivanhoe or Albion. It must be on a different run \u2014 probably the main lead from Linton's;\u2014 if so, the Golden Gate and Lucky claims must have it also. On the southern boundary of the Edinburgh the John Bull Company, which, about a fort night ago, broke into the deep ground and obtained a good prospect of coarse gold, having now erected puddling gear, are engaged to-day washing off their first machine, which I am informed looks well. The Lucky Company have completed their machinery, aud have accepted tenders for sink ing the shaft to the required depth. The litigation between the North American and Centaur Companies has terminated by the issue of a perpetual injunction against the former. The dividends of the North American have been \u00a3 10 per man for the last four weeks. They are sinking a new shaft on the deep end of their claim. It is very strange that the Pioneer Company in Linton private property have driven across the ground which must of necessity be tra versed by this run, and have never been able to obtain more than 2 oz. of fine gold to the machine. However, that does not decry the prospects of the company, as it is fully proved that the United Linton leads pass through the paddock. , The British Company have broken into the gutter. This claim and the Robin Hood, next to it, is considered to be very valuable, shares in them are quoted at very good prices. The Grand Junction Company have finished the erection of their machinery, and are at present sinking the shaft. The Atlas (Page's claim) have averaged for the last three months 30 oz. per week. Leaving Linton proper, the first company beyond Linton station is the Ophir, which has lately got into difficulties after having bottomed a shaft and ascertained the depth of the reef. The company is to be reorganised. The Victoria shaft, on the northern boundary of the Grand Junction, is 60 feet deep and now in hard blue rock. It is doubtful whether this company or the Grand Junction will get the deep ground. The ground between this and Lucky Woman's is held by the Mount Elephant, Great Wonder, and Hit or Miss Company. The first is on the private land of Mr. Lloyd, and have not yet broken the surface; the other two were sinking with some energy, when the New Zealand rush set in, since then there has been very little progress made by them. The Cleft of the Rock is improving, it gave 40 oz. during the 10th, 11th, and 12th Sept. '1 hey are not yet into the deep ground. The Try Again are 73 feet deep: they are putting in pumps. Their machinery will be completely erected in three weeks. Grand Trunk will have the engine ready to work in about three weeks. At Slaughter-yard Hill, Lucky Woman's, the Menai Straits Prospecting Claim continues to yield about \u00a36 per man weekly. There are some shallow claims doing well on Dreamers' Hill. The Eagle Quartz Mining Company have got a prospect of 12 dwt. to the ton. The Ivanhoe Lease gives from \u00a3 6 to \u00a3 1 0 per man weekly, and have still a large area of ground to work.

The New Independent Company also opened out at a depth of 140 feet, and after driving over 100 feet towards the Garibaldi Company, have struck the gutter ; they are now putting in a drive to test the width and quality of the wash-dirt. The Young Sons of Justice have also bottomed, but too shallow ; the company have sunk in the reef and are opening out, and hope to get gold in a week or ten days ; there is a good deal of speculation, and several shares have been sold at high prices, but there is no doubt some very rich ground, which is evident from the quantity of gold which has already been taken out of one c'aim (the Homeward Bound) up to the 28th September, viz, 2160 oz., and this claim is neither the best nor half worked out.

In the turning department I have noticed con siderable activity, occasioned by the extra work incidental on the work referred to, and the making of an hydraulic machine, which is to be used for forcing home stamp heads, and raising heavy lifts. Clunes Quartz Mining Company. \u2014 They are progressing with the erection of the new machinery for working the mine; the large engine, to draw and pump from the northern shaft, is fitted up, and the engine house nearly covered in. The boilers are well built in. and the chimney shaft, which is circular, is raised to its destined elevation, 68 feet. It is a well constructed piece of work. The whole of the additions of machinery to work this mine have been put up in a superior manner. The com pany employ 138 men. Clunes Alliance Quartz Mining Company are sinking their main shaft; the present depth is 240 feet ; they intend to open out at 320 feet. They have refitted the stamping engine, and the battery is in course of a thorough repair ; the stone met with in the sinking of the shaft is evidently auriferous ; several tons have beca sent to the Port Phillip Company for proof. Criterion Quartz Mining Company have crashed during the past five weeks 735 tons 16 cwt., which have yielded 499 oz 4 dwts. 17 grs. They are continuing to work the Robinson's Reef with very great success, as the dividends obtained by the shareholders during the month have amounted, to \u00a395. The worked-out ground is being secured by timber, and filled up with the tailings, debris from the crushing department. Clunes United Quartz Mining Company have crushed but a small quantity of quartz since my last report ; the amalgamation of the matter has not been completed, therefore no returns can be stated. The company have resolved to conduct their operations in future on the principle of contract ; they also intend to open up the mine deeper, and for the purpose of doing so, have increased their capital by making a call of \u00a350 per share. Yankee Company are crushing on the average 1 25 tons per week ; the yield has been 1 oz. 3 dwt. per ton. They employ 40 men. Victoria Company have crushed 5 1 0 tons of quartz, which have yielded 274 oz. 11 dwt. ; they have cut the Welcome Reef by a drive from the No. 2 level ; the stone looks to be highly auriferous; I have seen a large block evidently containing gold in large quantities. They employ 35 men, and have expended nearly \u00a31000 during the last month. New North Clunes Company are making arrangements for down pumps ; the water is too heavy, and a great hindrance to the further sinking of the shaft as worked heretofore.

Clunes Mining. \u2014 I have the honor to report that the returns of this portion of my district continues its steady character. Many miners of long residence have left this place, but I am informed that no diminution in the mining population has taken place, owing to an influx of mining laborers from Ballaarat and else where, which were at one time specially adver tised for by mining companies. The Port Phillip Company have crushed during the past four weeks 2595 tons of quartz, which yielded 1657 oz. 6 dwt. 12 gr.

Parker's Reef. \u2014 Since the party of twenty men took up the portion of this reef held under lease by the Parker's Reef Company (No. 106), and Gordon Parker's South Company (No.l 1 3), they have lost no time in forwarding their works. They have completed the repairs in one shaft to the depth of 100 feet, at which depth they are now taking out quartz upwards.

Making every allow ance for my falling on what may be a few of the best stones, my knowledge of the reef would lead me to expect at least one oz. per ton from these quartz, but they will not crush any until their own machine (which is now in course of erection) is ready. It is a horizontal high pressure engine, 16 horse-power, with eight stamps, the framework made with space for eight more when required. It is being put up on the reef close to an old shaft which is 260 feet deep, from which they expect a sufficient supply of water. the ground is patchy, the wash-dirt varying from two inches to eight inches deep ; there has been as much as 3 dwt. to a tin dish washed out of it ; there is only a small extent of the ground opened yet, so that the extent or course of the gold is not known. On the west gully there are still a few parties making a living as heretofore. All Nations Gully. \u2014 The only party who have continued to work in this gully for seme months past have struck on a new run of gold which promises to pay well ; they discovered it while working out some old ground. In removing the old timber they found itwas stand ing on what turned out to be a well-defined gutter four feet deep and eight to ten feet wide. They are now sinking a new shaft that will command the working of this ground to ad vantage. They expect to bottom at 68 feet. The Kangaroo Company are working on Hicks' Reef ; they are working up from a 220 feet level, and are now on 100 and 150 feet levels. The reef contiuues the same thickness (from 12 inches to 18 inches), but the yield per ton is less as they come up. The reef north and south from their shaft, about 60 feet each way, seems to be wearing out, as it only shows a thickness of from one inch to three inches, but they have not driven beyond this to ascer tain if it re-forms. Steiglitz Division. (Thomas \"Woolgrove, Mining Surveyor.)

Big Hill Reef. \u2014 This reef is now in posses sion of one company, with the exception of 80 feet in the centre. In the south end ata depth of 110 feet the reef is reduced to about three feet thick ; it appears to be breaking up south ward ; the centre of the reef at a depth of 120 feet is 15 feet wide, all of which is taken out, but the quartz seems best on about two feet of the east and west sides. On the north end the main reef appears to break up, but they have found a leader on the west side starting out about 15\u00b0 west from the line of the main reef ; in following it north from the point of contact with the main it has increased in thickness from three inches to five feet in a distance of 30 feet ; this may prove to be a new position which the main reef has taken on re-forming. The top quartz of the leader appeared of a very superior quality, but as all the quartz are mixed I can only arrive at the average yield of the reef, 4 dwt. per ton. This I received from the manager ; I had thought the average yield would he greater.

(which is rented). 1 hey had up to that time been still working on their barren vein till they reached another slip in the strata, where the vein is also broken off, leaving its usual tracing to the west. It is their intention to discontinue the working in this direction, which resolution had they adopted, as in kindness they were advised, they would not now be in the position of having expended nearly all their capital without the slightest return. This district has during the past month suf fered less through depopulation from the New Zealand rush than many others. The principal exodus has been from Morrison's. This migration is an act of greater folly in our mining population than in others Of upwards of from 30 to 40 square miles known to contain auri ferous deposits not more than 6 miles or there abouts have as yet been broken for mining purposes. At the beginning of the month two new discoveries have been made at the Stony Rises, near the Ballaarat road, and two others near Wallace's. I have only been to one at Wallace's, but will report more fully next month on them. One thing is satisfactory to know that they are doing well. Several n ug gets, averaging fivm 1 to 4 oz. in weight, have been found in Sailors' Gully, Dolly's Creek, and the gold altogether is of a much coarser character than that hitherto found on this field. The yield at Pennycuick's Rush, Wallace's, averages 4 dwt. to the tub. The Cosmopolite Company's ground still remains unworked, owing to some difficulties attending the granting of lease.

The Malakhoff Company have been busily engaged in stripping and raising large quantities of quartz from their lowest depth (over 300 feet), where it is found richer than ever before in the claim. Attention has again been directed to the metallic sulphurets as a source of gold supply j those collected from the mullock tailings have been found to contain about 5 oz. of gold per ton of sulphuret, while some collected from the quartz tailings of the Morning Star Company have yielded at the rate of 22 oz. per ton. If attention is given to the preservation of this waste, there being means on this gold field for its extraction, it may soon prove as great a source of gold as the mullock. If to these discoveries we add the superior knowledge and experience of some of our mining superintendents not in the knowledge of how to apply machinery, but in directing the application of labor and careful observation of strata, slides, and slips, and other daily circumstances arising in gold mining, we are as a community far ahead of any new country in the search for gold. The Gibraltar Company, adjoining the above, have completed the erection of pumps, &e. , and are now engaged in clearing the drives and lower workings of water, and making all clear and secure for mining operations. The Redan Company are still busy crushing mullock from their ground : it averages 2 dwts per ton, and the quantity crushed is about 500 tons per week. The New Chum Company are also crushing mullock, and with about the same results as above. The Morning Star Company have been crushing during the past month, but I have been unable to ascertain the results. They were hindered in the outset by some failure in their crushing apparatus ; this has been rectified and now works well. Blackwood Division. (Thomas Hay, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Wellington Reef Company have not crushed during this month, but are busily engaged in raising quartz for crushing in the course of a week or so. The Albion Company are getting remark ably rich stuff in their lowest workings, 309 feet ; they have during the past month obtained about 546 oz., and the manager informed me before this rich stuff was found that the weekly average was about 90 oz. I beg to refer you to the drawings and sections of same, with remarks attached. The New Year's Reef Prospect Company are engaged in preparing for crushing at the Blackwood machine ; 5 to 6 oz. per ton is expected. Some mullock has been crushed from the Norfolk Company's ground, which yielded 3^ dwts. per ton ; there arc large quantities of it, and this result will pay well. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Alluvial mining has been comparatively quiet on Steiglitz, but for the number of men engaged in it the yield has been pretty good, 65 oz. to 20 miners during the month. To some who have given the sources of gold deposits a careful and scientific consideration, it has long appeared probable that under the conglomerate which abounds in this district a gold deposit would be found of great extent sufficiently remunerative to be worked on a large scale. Experiments have this month been made confirming this supposition ; a deposit has been found which would yield from 2 to 3 dwts. per load, on the top of the ranges and in dry Total value of all mining plant in the division, \u00a322,000. working.

Some sluicers, at an early stage of the mania for leaving, succeeded in disposing of their claim to a party of Chinese for a price that would barely cover the value of the tools and materials which were included in the bar gain. Now comes the extraordinary facts of the case. These sluicers admitted that they have never cleared less than from \u00a34 to \u00a34 10s. per week per man from this claim which they have held for upwards of eighteen months, yet so impressed were they with the idea that their \" pile\" would be certain in New Zealand, that they could not resist the temptation. Many of them have already left, and many more appear to be making preparations for leaving. There are some, however, and these it must be said comprise the bulk of the population, in a position not to think of removing. Such are those who have not the means to risk the ex pense, and others who have established works and invested capital, which they are naturally afraid of sacrificing by the move, yet many would gladly sell their property, even below its value; but as all are influenced by the same motive and infected by the same mania, that of selling, there are no buyers, all being sellers, without purchasers. This appears to be the feeling which unfortunately predominates here at this time. New Zealand is in everybody's Several others have left under similar cir cumstances, and if the excitement lasts it cannot fail to produce a panic in mining opera tions here. Some storekeepers have left, and those re maining complain sadly of the falling off of trade.

The Lerderderg Company's works still re main inactive and from what I can learn it is difficult to say when they may be expected to move again.

A good number of Chinese have come back from their Lambing Flat expedition. In Bowman's Forest, with the exception of the two or three reefs and the seven top claims on the Perseverance Lead, that field may be said to be deserted. At Myrtleford, at the Waterloo Reef, they have been turning out some very good quartz, giving an average of 2 oz. 15 dwt per ton. The reefs upon the south-west of the Ovens have been unable to get their quartz crushed, in consequence of the high state of the river. At Pennyweight Flat they are generally very busily employed.

A trial crushing from the Homeward Bound Reef, Nine-mile Division, yielded 3 oz. 2 dwt. to the ton, and a crushing of 7 tons 5 cwt. from the Danish Reef yielded nearly 3 oz. to the ton. Fine weather having prevailed during the month, together with a fair supply of water, has caused mining operations in both the abovenamed divisions to be vigorously pro ceeded with. The crushing machine belonging to the Comasino leaseholders (Philippi and Com pany) is completed, and commences crushing on the 1st October. I will, in my next report, be enabled to send a list of the quantity crushed during the month, as also the yield. Towards the latter end of the month a few claims had to suspend working for want of water, but mostly all parties have had a good supply. The machine on Henderson's Reef has not been doing much during the past month, but I cannot ascertain either the quantities crushed nor the yield, having been refused the information. Nothing fresh in alluvial mining has taken place, with the exception of a few claims changing hands, the sellers being about to try their fortunes in New Zealand. On the whole, however, the New Zealand fever has spread but very little in either of my divisions, the miners therein being mostly comfortably settled down, and very dubious of changing fairly paying claims and comfortable homes for the uncertainty of a new gold field. The Polar Star leaseholders are progressing very rapidly with their machine, and expect to commence crushing in the course of a month On the other reefs parties are busy raising stone till such time as the machines can crush for them. Staghorn Flat. Yackandandah Division, is about to be thoroughly tested, two engines for pumping purposes being daily expected ; and I can almost confidently state, that, sooner or later, all the flats from thence to the junction of the Yackandandah Creek with the Little River (a distance of about eight miles) will be worked and found payable. With regard to quartz mining there seems every reason to hope that in this division it will become a most important feature of our mining interests, and taken together with the vast extent of unworked auriferous ground bids fair to render this one of the steadiest and most lasting gold fields of the colonv.

All the leads in our district have been in a very unsettled state during the month through the reports from New Zealand ; many having left, and others making arrangements to do so. The old leads on the Indigo (at work more or less) are paying wages, and will continue to pay for some time to come, particularly if they would settle themselves down and persevere in pushing their drives beyond the run of the lead, as there are so many gullies where small feeders are being constantly found, several having been proved this month, averaging from j to f dwt. to the bucket, of one foot in thickness of wash-dirt. Wahgunyah Leads are affected also with the New Zealand fever, many having sold out at mere nominal prices, though averaging from six (\u00a36) pounds and upwards per week, many of the claims will take two years to work out ; many of our leads are all but abandoned for want of water, as they will not pay to cart the wash dirt, though had we plenty of water, they would average from \u00a33 and upwards a week.

Messrs. Cotsworth and Wood will have completed their tramway in extension of their original line in the course of four or five weeks, when they will crush all the quartz raised from the Oriental Reef with the exception of No. 1 North and a small portion of that raised from No. 1 South, which will be crashed at the Oriental Crushing Company's machine. The claimholders on the Oriental Reef intend, I am informed, to apply in a short time for a lease of the ground now occupied by them, in which case it is likely that the Oriental Crushing Company will connect their machinery with that of Messrs. Cotsworth and Wood, who will then be able to crush about 1,500 tons per month. Messrs. Bickford and Company, who are now the occupiers of the Alta and Nelson Reefs on the Buckland, have lately been crush ing some of the best quartz they have been able to obtain. The principal quantity of the stone raised has been taken from the Nelson Reef, and I am informed that an improve ment has lately taken place in the prospects of this reef; I therefore hope to be able to report more favorably of the yield of the quartz. The stone raised from the Alta Reef was taken from a portion of the surface quartz which had not been removed by the prospec tors. The quantity of water in the lower workings of this reef will] probably prevent any deeper working of the vein for the present. The claims on the Oriental Reef continue to look well. Messrs. Cotsworth and Wood intend to work out the remainder of the surface reef before continuing the tunnel on the shaft they have lately been sinking, as at the present time there are more favorable indications of the second reef in No. 2 South, where the workings although not so extensive, have attained a greater depth. Returning to the Morse's Creek portion of the division, I beg to offer the following report of the reefs in that locality : \u2014 The Ebenezer Reef, which had been tempo rarily abandoned, has been taken up again for further trial by the same party, and they hava now succeeded in discovering a payable body of quartz in their claim. The width of the reef is on the average two feet, and the quartz obtained easily, and I am of opinion that the vein now being worked will with good manage ment prove very remunerative. Messrs. Wallace and Company have during the past month, disposed of their interest in No. 1 North on the Oriental Reef, and in the Pennyweight Reef, to Messrs Gitchell and Company, and they are now erecting a water wheel sufficiently powerful to drive 24 stampers near the Pioneer Reef in which they hold an interest ; at present only 1 2 stampers will be erected, and the remainder at a future time should they succeed in obtaining sufficient quartz in the neighborhood of their mill. Messrs. Richardson and Company continue to raise highly payable stone from their south level, at a depth on the average of 40 feet from the surface ; but I do not think from the for mation of the ground that they will be able to obtain much more quartz from the surface, as they are near a gnlly in which the southern boundary of their claim terminates. I may here remark that the course of the surface reefs in this district appears in every instance to be broken by the gullies between the spurs of the ranges, or if a small vein is traced near the surface in continuation, it is always non auriferous in the bed of the creek or gully. In consequence of this and the very mountain ous nature of the country in the Buckland Division, it is seldom that more than two or three payable claims can be taken up on the same line and more frequently the prospectors' claim is the only one worth working on the surface. Messrs. Gitchell and Company also intend to erect a machine to be worked by water-power in the locality of the Home and Pennyweight Reefs; and it is also proposed to erect a similar machine for Brenkman's Reef, Ovens River. Messrs. Murray and Company are also pre paring a site for a mill to be worked by water power contiguous to their reef on the Buckland, a trial crushing from which has turned out on the surface very rich and highly payable; also at a depth of 60 feet below this, the reef becomes much broken and shows present indi cations of running out, but there are probably two or three thousand tons of payable stone from the surface to the abovementioned depth. that is if the quartz now raised from the shafts may be taken as a sample. The prospecting claim on the Albion Reef is now occupied by Messrs. Gitchell and Com pany, the original party having abandoned the ground. This company are at present only The success of Messrs.

No. 1 North, on the Albion, has been aban doned. On the Pioneer Reef considerable quantities of quartz are being raised, but none will be crashed until the completion of Wallace and Company's machine. Messrs Gitchell and Gander have for the present abandoned the workings on Gander's Reef, as the late yield would not pay the ex pense of carting and crushing and the cost of draining the ground ; the reef, however, is very strong and well defined, and will, no doubt, be re-worked at a future time. Burchart's Reef, near the Pioneer, has not turned out so well as was expected ; there is, however, a large body of quartz, and the party are still sinking on the reef. The Pennyweight Reef at the present time shows a material improvement in the stone now being raised, but until the quartz has been crushed I can give no decided report as to whether or not the yield will be much greater than before, as on several occasions patches of good stone have been struck in this claim. The width of the reef is on the average six feet. Messrs. Prince and Company, prospectors of the Hampton Reef, are driving a tunnel to strike the reef at a considerable depth, and in the mean time are only raising a very small quantity of stone. During September no crushings have taken place on the Hit or Miss, and the Rose, Thistle, and Shamrock Reefs, but I am informed that the stone being raised is of good average quality. On the Home Reef the prospecting claim has been registered as not payable by the party last in occupation ; the surface reef has run out in the portion of the claim worked by them, and they this month disposed of their interest to Messrs Gitchell, Seilfeld. and Company. No. 1 North and No. 1 South continue good claims, and the workings in them having attained a much greater depth than in the prospectors' claim, it is likely that the reef will soon re-form in the latter. Falkner's Reef, (Ovens River,) continues one of the best in the district. The reef is now from three to four feet in width, and it is expected that the stone now being raised will yield as well as the former crushings. Brenkman's Reef, Ovens River, has also given a very good return during the past month. The reef is about six feet in thickness and is nearly horizontal. Li the prospecting claim a portion of the reef has been prospected sufficient to show about 3000 tons of surface quartz, which appear as good as that already crushed, aud the deepest level shows as good a reef as the average of that hitherto raised. Two other claims. No. 1 North and No. 1 South are being prospected. The prospecting claim on the Belville Reef suspended operations lor a part of September on account of excessive drainage, but they are now engaged in driving a tunnel for the pur pose of draining the claim. Falkner's Reef, on Growler's Creek, is still being prospected, but the quartz obtainable is not sufficiently payable for removal to Messrs. Gitchell's machine. It is intended by that company to remove the engine from Gander's Reef to Falkner's, and erect a battery of stamps on the claim. With the exception of the two lost mentioned reefs, none below the Rose, Thistle, and Shamrock, on the Ovens Kiver, have shown any improvement during the past month, and but little prospecting is being done on the intermediate ones. The West Briton is abandoned, also the Hibernian, Three-mile, and Welcome Reefs. Want of capital to undertake deep sinking prevents the miners from prospecting these, as the yield of a few pennyweights per ton will not pay their expenses at the present cost of carting and crushing. The surface reef on the Reliance Prospect ing Claim continues to yield very good quartz, but no main reef has been yet discovered. The White Star is now very poor, and the reef very hard to work ; the vein also is now narrow, consequently only a small quantity of quartz is raised. None has been crashed since my last report. The only discoveries of new veins of quartz which appear to be distinct reefs and of any promise are, the Helvetia Reef, situate about half-a-mile south-west from Falkner's Reef The Ulster Reef now shows very favorable prospects.

The opening of the New Zealand gold field has created quite a fever on Sandhurst, and more especially amongst the puddlers and allu vial miners in general ; all appear to be on the alert for definite information, and should the next account be good. I think we shall lose the half of our population. As it is, I have lost from my division alone about 1,200 persons. two-thirds of whom are miners, all males The flats and gullies seem quite deserted, for the present. Reefing is not so brisk looking as a few months ago, although you will see by the re turns that there are more steam engines at work this month than there has been for eight months previous, and crushing being mode rately low (Its.) it enables the reefers to send comparatively poor stone, and so knock out individual wages, which otherwise would not pay for crushing. fcheepshead Keef. \u2014 Moon and Company have completed the erection of their engine, and have started to crush from the large reef, which they presume will pay throughout somewhere near 1 oz. to the ton.

Moores, Elliott, and Company, by whom it has been wrought for the last four months, with very good success. The stone is very iarge, I and has averaged a yield of about 1 oz. per \u25a0 ton. Most of the public companies have made au effort to lower the extravagant rate of wages which has been thoughtlessly given, to some- thing more reasonable ; and they had partly succeeded, until this New Zealand rush took place, and wages are now rising higher than j ever.

I forward the enclosed tabular statement for September. 1861, remarking, at the same time. that the mining population cannot be ascertained at present in consequence of the great changes that have lately taken place, and the unsettled state of the miners, caused by the rush to New Zealand ; the result of which, as might be anticipated, has been a complete stagnation in mining pursuits, and almost a total subversion of the usual order of things. On every side may be seen idle steam machinery, abandoned puddling mills, and deserted gullies. It is gene rally estimated that Huntly has lost nearly one thousand of the miners, and many more are preparing to follow. I therefore cannot take upon myself to say. for the past month what the population may be, nor what mills are at work; but I can say, that during the same period not one application has been made for land for mining purposes, and only one for a puddling mill.

H. Smith, Esq. :\u2014 I regret being unable to furnish any account of the yields of the Waranga Reefs, the re turns from Rushworth and Whroo not having as yet been received. The Kedcastle returns are also imperfect from the same cause. At Whroo, the Whroo Mining Company, on the Albert Reef, are actively engaged in the erection of their new machinery. The depth of their shaft is 250 feet, and this has been sunk through strata of so retentive a character as to render timbering altogether unnecessary. The yield from the mine up to the present has been at an average of eight (8) oz. to the ton. Messrs Smith and Company, Cockatoo Reef, Rushworth, from a depth of 50 feet have obtained 7J oz. from 12 tons of stone. Another discovery has been made at Rush worth under circumstances which tend to corroborate the opinion already expressed by me some time back of the exceeding auriferous nature of the country about the Goulburn. The facts are simply these. Three miners after some weeks' labor in a small gully called Gossey's Gully, about lj miles from Rush worth, disgusted with their want of success were about trying their luck elsewhere when accident revealed to them that the sandstone bottom contained gold. A careful examina tion resulted in the discovery of an auriferous lode, and a trial crushing of 1 ton gave 3 ounces. The miners call the lode by the name of a Sandstone Reef, but the gold is found deposited between the strata, and not. as in quartz reefs, throughout the stone Small quartz veins, varying in thickness from -fe to of an inch mn through the sandstone, and no doubt when the mine is more fully developed it will be found that the gold is only deposited in these veins. The thickness of the reef is 18 inches, its course east and west, and its underlie to the south. The depth of the present workings is 20 feet. By the escort I will forward you some specimens for the Museum The gully was never rich in alluvial deposit, and the depth of the workings varied from one to eight feet.

The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The antimony reefs at Costerfield continue to be worked with success, although the present uncertainty relative to the value of the mineral has caused great depression among the miners engaged in this branch of adventure. A small quartz vein of exceeding richness has been struck in Messrs. Morris and Com pany's claim, at a depth of 45 feet. Although but 2i inches thick, a trial crushing has given a yield of nearly 10 oz. to the ton. Messrs. Morris and Company have purchased a small hand Berdan with which to crush their stone. The great want in this locality is machinery, the nearest mills being seven miles distant. The cost of cartage over bad roads is therefore great, and renders a rich yield necessary to meet expenses. As Costerfield is now rapidly advancing into importance the erection of good crushing and smelting machinery would, no doubt, prove a remunerative speculation. The Mclvor Caledonia Company have opened out at a depth of 236 feet, and expect to strike the reef in a drive of 80 feet length. The Long Gully Company have raised 100 tons of stone, which they are having crushed at Mr. Stephenson's Chilian Mill, Caledonia Gully. Up to this date but 5 tons have been crushed, the yield of which is 3 oz. 12 dwt. 14 gr. to the ton. Mining enterprise during the month has been unusually dull. The New Zealand fever has even reached this secluded district, and under its influence numbers are abandoning good claims and the prospect of future rich dis coveries, to tempt uncertain fortune on the Tuapeka gold fields.

It will be perceived that the mining popula tion has not been much reduced ; and, in quartz mining, the decrease is less observable. The chief locality in the division to which attention has been directed during the month, is Gibraltar, in consequence of the discovery of a valuable mass of gold aud quartz, weighing 14\u00a3 lbs., the metal contained in it amounting to upwards of 100 ounces. It was found at the depth of about 70 feet. Independently of its intrinsic value, it would have formed an inter esting addition to the geological department, on account of the singular manner in which the different substances were mingled. An unsuccessful attempt was made to obtain it for the abovenamed purpose, the owners requiring a price much in excess of the value of the gold. In the direction of Carisbrook and vicinity of the Old Britannia Reef, several prospecting claims have been taken up, the greater number of them being on quartz reefs, with which this particular locality abounds. The Imperial Reef, situate north Mosquito Reef, has recently proved highly auriferous towards its southern extremity, on one occasion as much as 180 ounces of gold being found in 200 lbs of quartz. The reef is being traced to a depth of 190 feet, and is about 11 inches thick. MARYBOROUGH MINING DISTRICT. Maryborough Division. (D. O'Leary, Mining Surveyor.)

A rush is at present going on at the head of Daisy Hill Flat, where the old lost lead has been discovered The sinking is from 20 to 30 feet, and some parties are washing from 3 to 4 oz. to the tub. The lead is narrow, and is being traced in the direction of the Reser voir Lead, which it is supposed it will join. In the neighborhood of the Mia Mia Flat many parties are doing extremely well. The workings are mostly shallow, and the gold is extracted with little expense.

I have the honor to inform you that, not withstanding the rush which has set in to New Zealand, mining matters throughout the divi sion are considered on the whole as highly satisfactory. The Mount Greenock Lead, although slowly, is favorably progressing. The United Britons are at present engaged in raising very good wash-dirt from this lead ; they had a washing lately of 20 loads taken indiscriminately of a depth of 18 inches, which yielded 32 oz of gold. The shareholders in the adjoining claim the other day obtained a prospect of 1 oz. to the tub. Beyond this the lead has not been proved, as no shafts have as yet been bottomed on a line with where this gold was obtained The water race belonging to Messrs Stewart and Fairnsworth. brought in from McCallum's Creek, is at present supplying sixteen parties of five each, who are engaged in sluicing the surface of Ballaarat Hill, Hard Hill, and the neighboring gullies. The parties work day and night, and each party is charged \u00a35 for the use of the water by day, and \u00a34 for its use by night.

This is much below the average of this com pany, but they are raising a large quantity of stone. I would call your attention to the large yield (15 dwt. per ton) derived from the crush ing of the cement and tailings of alluvial work ings long since deserted, on the old Avoca lead, 200 tons of which have been crashed by Messrs. James and Company on their own account this month. The small amount of stone crushed during the month in this district, is owing to the fact that the miners are busily engaged in sinking for the main lodes on the several reefs ; the quartz sent to the mills being chiefly procured from the surface. In my last report I mentioned that the miners working in Grumbler's Gully, close to the camp here, had applied to have their claims laid out under the frontage system. This has been done, and two shafts are now being sunk, one of which it is expected will be bottomed this week. This being the only instance in which the frontage system has been adopted in this portion of the district, the result of mining operations carried out under it is looked fonvard to with much anxiety. If successful it is expected that the increased area granted under the bye-laws will induce capi talists to erect machinery, in order thoroughly to test the value of the deep sinkings, which have hitherto been unworked, owing to the impossibility of the miners (working in small parties) being able to contend against the large body of water. Donollt Division. (R. J. McMillan, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Several small rushes have taken place, but none of sufficient consequence to warrant any particular notice, with the exception of one close to the old workings at Mountain Creek. The locality is known by the name of the \" White Patch.\" No regular lead has been discovered, The depth of sinking is 20 feet, and some of the washing stuff has yielded as much as 4 oz. to the load, but the area of auriferous workings appears to be limited, not exceeding one quarter of a mile square. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 By far the larger proportion of miners who left here for Rostron's Rush, and for Burnt Creek, in the Dunolly District, have returned. With respect to quartz reefs I may remark that the yields are in some instances individ ually rich, although in the aggregate seemingly poor, for instance : \u2014 From the Gloucestershire Reef, 16 tons yielded 20 oz. From the Richmond Reef, 28 tons yielded 21 oz. 10 dwt. From the Cambrian Reef, 1 ton yielded 2 oz. 4 dwt.

The machinery is as follows : \u2014 No reliable information has been obtained during the month to enable the surveyor to give the quantity of quartz crushed, or the yield of gold with any pretension to accuracy. Mill owners generally are not desirous of giving the required information. The population of the division has consider ably increased during the months of August and September, and alluvial mining in par ticular is in a more healthy state than it has been for a long time. The rush to Burnt Creek appears to be improving, and both the mining and business population have more confidence in it than they had a fortnight ago ; a great number of holes are getting gold, and there is every probability of its being a settled place for some time. The depth of sinking is from 45 to 65 feet, the deeper holes being generally wet, the thickness of wash -dirt varying from 6 inches to 5 feet. There has also been a rush to Inkermann, about five miles northerly from Dunolly ; the sinking is from surfacing to 20 feet, and a great deal of gold has been obtained, chiefly in the shallow ground running down from the ranges. The popu lation of this place is beginning to thin, but it still maintains about 1500. Cochrane's dig gings are improving, and the population is steadily increasing ; there are now about 1000 in that locality, chiefly employed in working the Cement Hills. There is one crushing mill at work, one in course of erection, and one preparing to be erected, and one horse machine. Total value of all mining plant in the division, \u00a331,000.

The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 15s. 3d. to \u00a33 16s. 3d. per oz. Mining matters have been very unsettled in this district during the past month. The con flicting news from New Zealand having in a great measure been the cause \u2014 as well as the cause of a sensible diminution in the population in the Korong Division. There is no alteration to record in quartz mining, with the exception that four new reefs have been opened, but of which it is premature to speak, notwithstanding they all have paying prospects. The quartz reefs at Inglewood have not at all fallen off, but the bye-laws of this district allow claims to be worked by a small propor tion of the men forming the party, thus enabling the remainder to leave the district without forfeiting their interests in the claims. Korong Division. (John S. Robertson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Several quartz reefs which had apparently run out of the paying quartz, have within the last month recovered the same at depths from 100 to 130 feet. Many of the reefs are now below water level, and are obliged to suspend operations until proper machinery can be erected. The drain age of reefs will very soon require the serious attention of the miners in this district. The alluvial mining at Inglewood remains still in the same state as it did last month, viz., rather dull. At Old Inglewood, I have, in accordance with the bye-laws laid out the deep lead under the frontage system.

It is expected that it will pay under that system, although not remunerative worked as block claims. It is called the Hope Lead. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 A party of prospectors about four miles due south from Inglewood, and within a quarter-of a-mile of the Tarnagulla road, obtained a paying prospect, in consequence of which a small rush took place, but although over five hundred claims were marked out, on account of the shepherding regulations, not more than fifteen or twenty bottomed their shafts, and these not meeting with the success they ex pected, has caused the ground to be nearly abandoned. At Kingower the quartz reefs have rather improved during the month, but the number of alluvial miners has been terribly diminished by the New Zealand fever. Total value of all mining plant in the division, \u00a318,256. Number of square miles of alluvial ground which is being or may have been actually worked upon, 18. Number of distinct quartz reefs which have been actually proved to be auriferous to the present time, 56. The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 12s. to \u00a33 17s. 6d. per oz. Jericho is the only place in my district to which the miners have remained true during this exodus. This is, perhaps, to be accounted for by the fact that most of the quartz miners are of some years' standing, and the reefs although not extraordinarily rich are very steady in their yield. Korong having lost a good many alluvial miners, coupled with the fact that most of the reefs are at a stand still, presents rather a doleful appearance as far as mining operations are concerned. At the commencement of this past month, the mining population of this division was gradually decreasing, owing to the several little rushes in the Dunolly and Avoca Divi sions ; but towards the end of the month it again increased, although still showing a de crease of about two thousand .- but should the new workings near Peter's old station continue to yield as it has commenced (being the cau*e of increase), it will assuredly return to its old number. On account of the numbers who have left Inglewood. a temporary depression has been felt in trade, naturally causing a feeling of despondency in particular branches, but I am happy to say that in mining operations, I believe matters are fully equal to last month. The washdirt at these new workings is yield ing from 1 oz to 1 oz. 10 dwt. per load, 15 feet sinking. Of mining memoranda in general there is but little to report during the last month. The alluvial in this division always fluctuating, and but little to be relied on, good prospects now and again being obtained, but not lasting ; the ground worked in nearly every instance yield ing generally a living to a number, but a sum beyond to none. In the quartz working of this district we are more fortunate, the reefs being more lasting, yielding more generally, and in many instances very handsomely. For some little time the reefs in this division have been neglected, and but few worked; latterly, however, a new state of things has occurred, the reefs both old and new being taken up and vigorously worked, the rush to New Zealand notwithstanding : in reference to the latter, I think I shall be able to report its influence on the quartz miners of St. Arnaud as favorably as I did that of Port Curtis, Snowy River, Sec -, to neither of these rushes St. Arnaud Division.

We have this month been visited by Mr. Marchant for the purpose of fixing site for reservoir, the bare thought of which being completed is a great satisfaction to the miners and other residents. Lancashire Reef. \u2014 This reef bids fair to be a very remunerative one. several claims south of the prospecting claim having obtained payable stone ; none has yet been crushed, although it is now being carted to the machine. It is this want of the necessary element that in my belief sends our miners to other gold fields both in and out of the colony ; to my knowledge there are many places on both old and new leads that would now support hun dreds, if water were at hand ; but to pay the cost of cartage would be giving the actual profit in the working, so that failiug the neces sary contiguous supply, the ground must be abandoned, the only reasonable conclusion being, that it is only by making serviceable reservoirs that this floating population can ever be retained. My remarks above apply more forcibly to other districts than to this ; to ourselves the reservoir will be of invaluable service, its site adding wonderfully to its use, from its position being able to supply the whole of the town, as also the two miles of agricul tural blocks (cultivated), and any portion of the country south-east for miles. Ballaarat Reef. \u2014 Grirrson and Company are still pushing on, although as yet with no great result ; a small kiln has been sent to machine, the result of which I have not yet heard. The paper pipes answer every expectation, both vertically in this claim, and horizontally at the St. Arnaud United. St. Arnaud United.\u2014 This company has this week been delayed in consequence of the breaking of the large spur-wheel and pinion, and having to send to town for a new one. The last yield was more satisfactory than the former one ; from the appearance of the stone now being raised, I shoidd think this will be still more so. Sebastopol Lease. \u2014 This lease, after being neglected for some months, has been again commenced, and with more signs of its being effectually carried on than formerly, men being employed to timber permanent shaft and clear away surface for site of machinery. Bristol Reef. \u2014 On this reef the whole of the claims are being worked with spirit, the last crushing of Jewitt and Company yielding ovcr2 oz. per ton, the reef being between four and five feet thick \u2014 the gold still retaining its position as formerly shown in this reef; were these portions taken separately the result would be handsome indeed. Perseverance Company. \u2014 This company, to the north of the St. Arnaud United, are now down about 180 feet, but with no signs of the reef as yet. Stuart's Hill. \u2014 On the northern slope of this hill, Messrs. Edwards and Company are still working, and confessedly in the dark as to its value. Some gentlemen, lately visiting this claim, are of opinion there is from 10 to 20 pounds of silver per ton contained in the quartz ; all who have any knowledge of silver, and have visited this place, express their sur prise at its present moderate yield by crushing being from 5 to 10 oz., containing about \u00b1 gold. I forwarded, some time since, small specimens from this claim, and will again do so, in the hope it may induce you to consider its pe culiarity, being the only silver lode to my knowledge in Australia, and by doing so, may attract the attention of those whose knowledge of the same; if directed thereto, would develop this important addition to our metalliferous veins. There is nothing further worthy of report. CASTLEMAINE MINING DISTRICT. Castlemaine Division. (Thomas Lawrence Brown, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Bell Rock. \u2014 This hill has again attracted the attention of the quartz miners of this dis trict.

The machinery is as follows many of the reefs rich finds continue to reward the persevering miner. On the Bolivia Reef the Ajax Company are increasing their machinery by an additional battery of eight stampheads, this will afford them extra facilities for reducing their large body of stone, which continues to yield over 2J oz. of gold per ton. The new company, late Sir Henry Barkly, have already moved their machinery to the southern end of Bolivia, and from present ap pearances will soon commence draining and crushing. The Undaunted Company, on the Cumber land Reef, have improved prospects, having found quartz yielding nearly one' oz. per ton. Other claimholders continue to realize working expenses. The Nuggety Reef maintains its character, 6 tons from Moore and Company's claim having yielded 118 oz. 1 dwt.; Neate and Company, 14 tons gave 20 oz. 2 J dwt.; and the Nuggety Company from 647 tons, broken and crushed indiscriminately, realized 323 oz. of gold. The Old Post Office Hill Reef is being re worked with remunerative results, and so soon as preliminary operations are completed good yields are anticipated. Total value of all mining plant in the division, \u00a367,000. Some of our older companies, as the Old Quartz Hill, Specimen Gully, Ph\u0153nix (late Eureka), and El Dorado, have been trying to let the mines and plant upon tribute, the suc cess of the Bolivia Reef tributers inspiring great confidence in that system of working. Parties of working men have inspected the works in each case, and have expressed then confidence in and willingness to undertake the working, but the assumed fascinations of New Zealand have counterbalanced their previous intentions, leaving these fine reefs unworked. Number of square miles of alluvial ground which is being or may have been actually worked upon, 25. Number of distinct quartz reefs which have been actually proved to be auriferous to the present time, 83. The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 14s. 3d. to \u00a33 15s. 9d. per oz. Mining operations have been materially checked in consequence of the improvident rush to New Zealand of so large a number of our most successful miners, many of whom have abandoned or disposed of their plant and claims. Men who have been averaging \u00a34 to \u00a36 per week, selling everything to Chinese or other miners for just sufficient to pay their expenses to the new El Dorado ; the dear bought experience of Port Curtis and similar rushes appearing in no way to influence the roving propensity of a mining population. In several instances rich specimens have been found in new ground: the first was by navvies in railway cutting, who have discovered the lost lead in the Hard Hill, laying further east than formerly worked. Of course the reef is reoccupied on each side of the railway fence. In Sailors' Gully valuable specimens are found near the surface in new ground, the reef apparently being a continuation of Dead Cat Reef. A new reef or leader has been found in Wattle Gully, westerly from the old workings, which promises well ; and several other claims are being taken up either on or in continuation of formerly payable reefs, which, on the return of miners from the rush to New Zealand, will certainly add to our gold producing resources. The consequence to this district is, a popula tion less by hundreds than last month, a large proportion of machinery idle or very partially worked, and a great number of quartz and other claims registered, awaiting the return of repentant rushers. Quartz mining is still progressing. From Description.

Several hundreds of the ablest of our miners have left for New Zealand ; and the indecision evinced by great numbers still work ing here has given the district a Useless appear ance such as I have not seen since my residence here. Hepburn Division. (Ambrose Johnson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 In quartz mining there is no improvement. The LI Dorado works are still suspended. The Ferron's Reef Company are busy, as also are Pilcher and party. Gingell and Company have had a good crushing from the Frenchman's Reef, Mopoke, and Tarr and Company, from the German Gully Reef. Alluvial mining never was so dull, and, with the exception of Heron's Hill, nothing is stirring worth recording. At Heron's Hill twelve tun nels are being driven beneath the trap rock, from one of which 5 oz. to the load has been realized, none of the others are in. The num ber of tunnels going into Heron's Hill exceeds those driven into any hill in the Fryer's Creek district, at the same time there is room for fifty more. I have not the least doubt that all the hill will be rushed as soon as one or two other tunnels shall have struck the auriferous drift. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Table Hill is remarkably dull, as also are Kangaroo and Butcher's Hills. Scarcely any perceptible difference is ob servable in the puddling operations. Many puddlers are still making good wages. The Chinese at Guildford have formed quite a township ; they have regularly formed streets (although very dirty and very narrow), and excellent buildings of paling and weatherboard consisting, in many instances, of two stories. These buildings are tastefully decorated both inside and out; several contain as many as twelve rooms in the upper storey, besides a large gambling saloon below : these rooms are neatly papered and well furnished, and had not the Celestials an extraordinary averseness to cleaning their floors, many of these buildings would be really inhabitable. The larger erec tions are used as cook-shops, eating-houses, gambling and opium saloons, &c. This township contains from 1,500 to 2,000 inhabitants, and supports two circuses. If the amount of noise and confusion is any criterion, I should imagine the Chinese in this locality are doing remarkably well. Total value of all mining plantin the division, \u00a328,500.

Brown and Com pany, have started a tunnel from the foot of the hill. From the Welcome Company's machine I have not received the return, which I shall insert in my next report. Quartz mining. \u2014 During the last month this branch of mining has been in a most healthy state, and the splendid yield of over 1200 oz. of 104 tons of quartz from Adams' New Reef has naturally in no small degree contributed towards creating and strengthening a faith in the capabilities of our quartz reefs, for the want of which scores of claims, in which actually payable prospects have been obtained, are left unworked. Quartz mining is an occupation in which, more than in alluvial, perseverance coupled with a sound practical knowledge is required, and in this division, where the strike of the reef and the dip of the gold-bearing quartz i? generally very sudden , capital forms no mean item in the requirements of the miner. The. Fearnought Company in Camp-street are stacking their quartz, having made arrange ments with Mr. Wilson, of Dry Diggings. That gentlemen is removing his engine to a new site, near the Fearnought Company's workings. In the purchased allotments, both sides oif Camp-street, shafts are sinking, and the reef being worked, and on the whole the greatest activity displayed. On Gray's Reef the last crushing yielded about 9 dwt. per ton, inadequate to pay with the amount of water the prospectors have to contend with, and the claim is therefore regis tered, the owners being desirous of coming to arrangements with capitalists for furnishing machinery. Melvin's Reef, head of Blind Creek, has again been taken up by the original prospec tors, Messrs. Melvin and Company, who are preparing to commence operations. This reef has on an average paid 5 or 6 dwt. per ton by a width of 14 to 16 feet of quartz, and I have no dojbt such a reef under existing circum stances could be worked profitably. From Adams' New Reef I have heard of the crushing from claim No. 2 South with satisfac tion. The yield of over 1 2 oz. per ton for a quantity of upwards of 100 tons of quartz is something so uncommon, and cannot help, in benefiting the lucky owners of that particular claim, at the same time to further the general quartz mining interest of the district. Claims No. 1 (Prospecting Claim), Nos. 2 South and 3 South are the only ones where gold has as yet been struck, but in the rest of the claims south sinking is vigorously carried on, and if the water should not prove too serious an obstacle, gold may shortly be expected to be struck in some of them. Specimen Reef, or the White Reef, Specimen Hill, Wombat Creek, for the working of which a company had been formed, and which hitherto from some difficulty among the shareholders has been dormant, has during the month, I am informed, changed hands, and I am convinced this reef will, with good management and effi cient machinery, prove as good a mining spe culation as any in the district. On Wombat Reef, Wombat Hill, the Cornish party are as usual netting a handsome dividend. The Havelock Company are preparing to erect machinery of their own, and are in the mean time stacking their quartz. Grenfell and Com pany have temporarily suspended operations, and registered their claim. On Adams' Old Reef the Warren Hastings Company have applied for a lease of 420 yards, and also taken up a site for dams and ma chinery, and I expect that as soon as the roads become passable the machinery will put in an appearance. On Collier's Reef, parallel with and about 400 feet west of the last named, Reilly, Duck worth, and Company have, by excess of water, been compelled to cease operations for a time at least. Woodworth and Company are pros pecting from a tunnel from Smith's Creek, but have not, as far as I am aware, struck payable gold. Cowham and Company have only lately commenced sinking, and will probably have to go 150 feet or thereabouts before striking pay able gold. On Emeu Reef the Hong Kong Company have purchased an engine at Ballaarat, and are only waiting for dry weather and better roads to bring the machine on the ground and com mence operations. From Martygeaux Reef, Champagne Gully, the quartz from the prospecting claim only yielded a couple of dwt. per ton, and the party have therefore commenced sinking their shaft deeper to prove the reef at a lower level. Sampson and Company's last crushing yielded about 1^ oz. per ton, by a width of"], [425, "MININS SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 SEPTEMBER. 401 From Adelaide or the Welcome Reef, head of Don't -wake -em, the average yield from claims Nos. 1, 2, and 3 South has been 1\\ to 3 oz. per ton, the width of reef varying from a few inches to a couple of feet ; but owing to its southern strike the reef is below water level in claims Nos. 4 and 5 South, and these claims have therefore registered until the adjoining claims have attained the same depth, and assist them in overcoming the difficulty. lately, splendid quartz was discovered (in claim No. 3, North Glamorganshire Reef) 60 feet above the bottom of the shaft, and parties are since then extremely suspicious of leaving shafts upon which very frequently ten or twelve months labor have been expended. On Hoggett's Reef, Messrs. Johnson and Company have taken up 1,500 feet, and re sumed operations, but nothing of importance has transpired. The Perseverance Company, in the bed of Sailors' Creek near Tipperary Point, are at a stand during the wet season, but operations will probably shortly be resumed. On Old German Reef the Goldsmith Quartz Mining Company, have not yet settled their affairs, and the workings are at a stand still. The whole of Trogish's Reef, as also the King Billy's, Caledonian and Columbian Reefs, are idle, the shareholders having exhausted their means, without having arrived at any definite result. The New Nuggety Reef in Connell's Gully is regularly turning out good stone, but the Welcome or Connell's Reef is entirely aban doned. From the Beehive Reef, Dry Diggings, no crushing has taken place during the month, but the quartz being raised looks as promising as ever. On Glamorganshire Reef.seven or eight claims are working, first rate paying quartz being raised in the prospecting claim, and No. 2 and 3 north (see tabular statement), but the rest of the claims although sunk to a considerable depth have not yet proved successful. From Hartley's Reef some 8 tons from the prospecting claim have been crashed, and the yield averaged about 1 5 dwt. per ton. At pre sent only a series of leaders are being worked, but there is every appearance of their ultimately forming into one body. On Hamburgh Reef, the prospecting claim No 2 South, are in the hands of a company, called the Hamburgh Company, who intend erecting machinery, and have applied for a lease of the ground. On Parker's Specimen Reef, the Dry Dig gings Company has been remodelled, and has commenced operations under the name of the Prince Llewellyn Company. The company is at present engaged erecting machinery, and intend, in about a fortnight, to start crushing. The same company has purchased Wilson's race, from Wallowbee Creek to Shepherd's Flat, passing through the company's site for machinery, and dam, for a sum of \u00a3115, or thereabouts. In claim No. 2 North, a large body of quartz has been prospected at various levels to a depth of 160 feet, by Messrs. Case and Company, who have held that claim for upwards of nineteen months. No quartz has been crashed, but it is expected that with machinery on the ground the claim could be profitably worked. The rest of the claims are registered. From Great Reef, Messrs. Royan and Com pany, have crushed 30 tons yielding at the rate of 5 dwts. per ton, and the Great Reef Com pany are at a stand, pending a reorganization of the company. On Sportsman's Reef, matters are also favor ably progressing, Messrs. Bettyston and Com pany preparing to erect machinery of then own on the claim, the last quartz crushed having yielded about 5 oz. per ton, and the reef continuing to turn out very promising stone. Pioneer Reef is also dormant, with the ex ception of the Pioneer Company's lease. The company are busily erecting their machinery, and in the meantime sinking their engine shaft, raising quartz, &c. It is to be hoped that when the company commences active opera tions, pumping and crushing operations will be resumed in the adjoining claims with renewed vigor. In Yandoit, quartz mining is, with the exception of five or six claims, in a languishing state. A considerable number of claims are being worked, but a still larger number are registered, the owners having spent upon them too much labor to feel inclined entirely to aban don them, and at the same time feeling still less inclined to venture more time or money. They have in most instances no intention of resuming work, but could not at the same time entertain the idea of other parties taking possession of such claims, and by chance reap the benefit of the work previously expended. In one ease From Malcolm's Reef in private property, Messrs. Morrison and Company, have been crushing 42 tons, the gross amount of gold being 48 oz. 6 dwt.

This present rush is, however, of so recent date, that nothing defi nite can be said as yet. The appearance of the country, however, is very promising, and the failure of the former rush is now, in a great measure, accounted for. depth of 160 feet, or thereabouts, has com menced erecting machinery, having failed to come to terms with the claimholders in Mal colm's property. Besides the reefs, a number of prospecting claims are being worked on different lines, both in Jim Crow, and Yandoit, but no discovery of public interest has been made during Sep tember. From Glengower, where, for the last eighteen months shafts have been sinking, on Oliver Cromwell's Reef, Sardinian Reef, and Boat swain's Reef, and where a depth of 180 feet, or thereabouts, has been obtained, 1 learn, that a very promising leader has been struck on the Boatswain's, while 4 tons from the Oliver Cromwell's yielded about 1 oz. per ton. In alluvial sinking, the only occurrence of note is the discovery of the Whisky Lead, near Champagne Gully. The lead does not in any particular feature distinguish itself from the surrounding gullies ; the depth of sinking in the lower end is between 30 and 40 feet, gradually running more shallow towards the head. The lead is at present being worked for a distance of about a mile, being only one claim wide ; but 3 or 4 oz. per tub is not of unfrequent occurrence, and on the whole, as far as the lead has been traced, the ground is con sidered as good as any for years opened on Jim Crow. Puddling and Sluicing. \u2014 In these branches of mining, notning of importance has occurred, no new ground has been opened, and in the old workings, matters are as usual satisfactorily progressing. The sameness of these operations are only likely to be broken in upon by the absence of water during the summer, or by the opening up during winter of extensive new ground, and although some very good new ground has lately been opened, still its extent is too limited to influence the steady puddler or sluicer ; even the superior allurements of New Zealand, have entirely failed to entice any of this class of miners away. In Daylesford, the Township's Lead is gra dually getting worked out, at least the lower portion of it. This ground has also, on the whole, proved first-rate, 30 or 40 oz. per week being considered no extraordinary yield for six men's labor. The upper or southern por tion of the lead has not yet been fairly tested; but, in Mr. Kirwan's paddock, between Duke and Camp streets, the Emerald Company's shaft is expected to bottom in three or four weeks : and in Queensberry-street, south of the Camp reserve, Messrs. Spence and Company will, probably also within this month, have obtained some definite results. The destruction of the Daylesford Reservoir has been of some service, in so far as the sudden flood in Sailors' Creek has removed an enormous mass of sand and tailings, leaving the gold behind ; and a large number of Chinamen, and several European parties, have since then been making as much as 12s and 1 5s per day running old tailings through their boxes. The Wombat Hill Gold Mining Company, in the Camp Reserve, have struck water too heavy to overcome with ordinary appliances, and are making arrangements for procuring machinery. Messrs. Salmon and Company, south of Spence and Company, in Queens berry-street, are driving a tunnel, but have not yet attained the gutter. In tunnelling, the same activity as usual prev ails ; but no new ground has been opened, and no marked improvement has occurred. In Italian Hill, Francesco, Ceres, and Company, and Taddai and Company's tunnels are progressing; and in Elevated Plains, Hart and Company's tunnel is reported to have broken through, with a good prospect. In Shepherd's Flat, the Shepherd's Hat Cold Mining Company have shifted their en gine, and are reported to have struck very payable dirt in their new shaft. In Sebastopol Hill, the Ballaarat Company are upwards of 2,200 feet into the hill, and it is not improbable that two or three hundred feet more will be required before the gutter is attained.

I have heard nothing lately from the Ex tended Company in King William's Gully, but the last information I received spoke favor ably of the affairs of the company. In Glengower, some fifty or sixty miners are working with various success in the old shallow gullies, principally Stockyard Gully ; but, on the whole, I believe they are not making much above a comfortable living.

The following information has been obtained, relative to the quantity of Quartz crushed during the month, and the Gold obtained therefrom : \u2014 At the Barfold Ranges there has been quartz crushed at both the machines which are in operation, but the parties concerned did not like to give any statement. I believe the quartz in all cases yielded very poorly. Similar reluctance was shown at the Bell topper Reef, the parties being unwilling to publish their returns. From the other reefs tliere have been no crushings during the month. There has been considerable decrease in our European population this last month, although there appears an increase of Chinese ; these are very busy about the valley of the Back Creek, both within the township and imme- diately south of it. They have purchased au acre of private property for \u00a340, and several smaller pieces at a less rate. Their practice is to open large areas designated \"paddocks,\" and work in large parties. The tunnelling at Yankee Point by Europeans produces various results, but only three parties seem satisfied with the returns. Preparations are making for the erection of a steam crashing machine in this quarter, to reduce the cement bearing goid, which is found in the tunnel on the east side of the creek. Mr. Dodge intends moving his machinery from the Belltoppcr Reef, where future prospects look very dubious.

All the known reefs are fully occupied, with the single exception of Miller's, which is situate 1 s\\ mile further north than any other. At Scorpion Hill, the party working the old ground have met with but poor remuneration for their labor, but in the long tunnel, in new ground, the results are satisfactory. In the long tunnel they have been obliged to open an air vent through an old shaft to induce a current to expel the foul air. The two crushing machines have been in full operation for a month past ; the quartz that they have reduced has been for the most part refuse stuff which was left on the ground by former miners ; and I believe no good stone has been crushed. Several parties are working about the old ground of both Liberty Flat and McMillan's. It is to be hoped this second occupancy of the Barfold Reefs will prove successful, and duly reward the enterprise of those who have so energetically resumed their working, and those also who have speculated in the erection of machinery and of stores. But there are not above one-third the number of miners to be seen now as there were last month. Four claims are still held on the Belltopper Reef, although the late returns have been very poor, aud they have gone to a depth of 1 50 feet. The vein is very small. Four claims are also held on the Humboldt Reef, but paying results have only obtained from the prospector's privilege. Maldon Division. (R. Nankivell, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Malmsbury Diggings. \u2014 The alluvial ground contiguous to the Coliban Reef has afforded profitable employment to about 30 men during the month ; but I have just been told that their numbers were increased yesterday to about 100. In two claims they have washed out \\ oz. of gold from the tub of earth, and the average yield from those claims which are on the lead is computed at J oz. per tub. With respect to the reefs, McCleur and party on the prospector's privilege are doing well, but the others have not yet struck anything good. Five parties have sought the advantage granted under \" registration \" of temporarily relinquishing their claims for two months, and are trying their luck on the alluvial ground adjoining, where gold has been found, as mentioned above. Kangaroo Creek. \u2014 At the place ten miles south of Malmsbury, where gold was disco vered some short time back, the prospecting party obtained last week a nugget with quartz attached, which yielded 1 6 oz. of gold. It is only in this one claim that gold has been obtained in paying quantities. Remarks. \u2014 About 60 miners have left this division for New Zealand. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Victoria Field. \u2014 Mining operations are ex tremely dull in this field. The mining popu lation probably not numbering 50, whilst this time last year there were about 300.

Two other nuggets, 6 oz. each, were found yesterday. The puddlers having plenty of water are now busily engaged and making good wages. The Maldon Gold Washing Company have washed 1200 loads, which yielded 40 ounces. Twenty -seven men have been employed by this company during the month. Quartz Companies. \u2014 Nuggety Reef. \u2014 Miller, Crystal, and Company hace this week struck some exceedingly rich stone, richer than has been seen on Tarrangower for a long time. There has not been any crushed yet, so that I cannot even give an approximate idea of the yield ; it is the intention of the proprietors to send some specimens to the Exhibition if not too late. This stone has been straek at a depth of 280 feet. The lease lately forfeited on this reef, and taken up by the original claim holders, is turning out first-rate. What they have crushed has yielded 4 oz. to the ton, but the stone now being broken looks much better. A branch lead has been discovered running south-east, which is yielding well. At the north end of the lead the sinking is getting deeper (about 40 feet) and wet, while the re mainder is dry. In my opinion there will yet be a deeper lead discovered when the ground is better prospected, as the water is not found in the main diggings, and must have an outlet somewhere. At the Muckleford diggings there has been a few small rushes, but nothing extraordinary has been discovered. A number of Chinamen are working in the old workings, Mia Mia Gully, and from the quantity of gold sold by them they must be doing well. South Linscott's Company's Reef still con tinues payable ; the yield has improved slightly since last month. Miller and Company's claim, adjoining this ground on the south, have struck some splendid stone this week at a depth of 240 feet. This is the same party who holds the rich claim on Nuggety Reef, and his absence in Sandhurst has precluded me from getting the returns. Two or three parties are still employed at Bradford, surfacing, but no finds of any im portance has taken place.

The machinery is as follows The Eaglehawk Union Company's reef is looking a little better for this month ; they have only washed off the first nine days' crushing. The Eaglehawk Company's mine has also improved this month under the tribute system. The new reef has turned out some good stone, but they have been stopped from sinking by an influx of water, and are now preparing gear for pumping it. The Beehive Company have also adopted the tribute system ; the yield this month has increased. Rogers and party, Irish Billy's Reef, have crushed a quantity of quartz this month, which yielded 1 \u00a3 oz. to the ton. A new reef has been struck in the vicinity, and the prospectors have had one crashing which yielded half an ounce to the ton. It has been named the Otago Reef.

The population is as follows : \u2014 It will be seen by the foregoing tables that notwithstanding the exodus from this colony to New Zealand, the population of this division has increased considerably during the past month. This increase, however, is not dis tributed through the various gold fields of St. Andrew's division, but exhibits itself only on the portion thereof comprising the Britannia gold field, where, I am informed, many are doing remarkably well, although, from the wetness of that locality, this season of the year is most unfavorable for mining operations, and especially so this year, from the unusual amount of rain which has fallen. There will, I have no doubt, be a still further increase in the number of miners, and more extensive mining operations will in all probability be commenced on the Britannia gold field as soon as the fine weather sets in and the floods in the various creeks and gullies Remarks.\u2014 The increase in the number of alluvial miners is only as regards the population of the Britannia goldfield.

As regards alluvial mining on the Cale donia gold field, I have the honor to report for your information, that in the gullies near the Kangaroo Ground, namely, Research or Swiper's Gully, the population remains nearly the same ; but the average yield of gold per man per week is, so far as I can learn, rather below the average stated in my last report. Some slight successes have been met with in the upper part of Whisky Gully. One nugget, weighing 9 oz., and several smaller ones, have been reported to me as having been found there during the month of Sep tember. This gully has been rushed and abandoned several times, although it cannot be said to be more than half worked yet. It is intersected near its upper end by an auriferous quartz vein from One-tree Hill, which no doubt has contributed largely to the deposit cf alluvial gold here. The same applies to Draper's Gully. In this gully, however, the diminished yield of gold is attributed to the long continuance of wet weather ; and as the ground is very wet indeed it is most difficult to work it, even in the driest weather. Payable gold has been found in tne portion of Back Creek between the Yow- Yow Creek and Wild Dog Gully. At Sawpit Gully, on the Yarra, there is a population of about 50 miners, some of whom are doing pretty well ; but this ground is so exceedingly patchy that the incomes of the miners there are small in the aggregate, and, of course, very uncertain. However, as this gully is in the immediate vicinity of a large tract of untried countiy, and has been but partially worked itself, there is every proba bility that successful prospecting will be carried on to some extent during the coming summer. Very marked indications of gold are to be found for miles around this locality. This part of the creek, although having Black Calf and Wild Dog gullies as imme diate tributaries, both of which are autiferous, and being below both these gullies in the watershed, has nevertheless been looked upon hitherto as not being payable ground, and con sequently left unworked until now. In quartz mining there is remarkably little doing on the Caledonia gold field. The only reefs on which workings are being carried on are as follows : \u2014 A slight rush took place during the early part of the month to one of the upper branches of New Watery Gully. Few, except the very unfortunate, bettered their condition by coming to this rush, as the average yield of gold is not quite half a pennyweight to the tub. This yield is, however, pretty regular ; so that the means of purchasing the necessaries of life are to be obtained here with a tolerable degree of certainty, and with no very excessive amount of labor. Oram's Reef, between Queenstown and the Kangaroo Ground ; and Albert's, Allen's and Gillman's reefs, on the Yow- Yow Hills; and on One-tree Hill there are but two claims being worked on the Swedish Reef, namely, the ground held by the Smvthe's Creek Mining Company, and claim No. 2 South. In the first mentioned claim the workings are at a depth of 180 feet, and at this depth there is an improvement in the vein, both as regards richness and width. At Fern-tree Gully some good patches are still occasionally met with, notwithstanding that this gully is now pretty well worked ; and although there is no regular lead, nearly all the miners there are making a good livelihpod. I herewith forward sheet 28 of plans illus trative of my division, it being a plan of part 2 of Back Creek, or that portion of the said creek connecting Old Caledonia Creek with Ironbark Gully.

ARARAT MINING DISTRICT. Ararat Division. There is no doubt but much of the untried ground, within a radius of ten miles from the township of Ararat, will turn out as profitable, when prospected, as the numerous small rushes such as the Cement Hill, Mitchell's, Pic-Nic Gully, Mullock Bank, or Commissioner's Hill. (John Usher, jun., Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 In consequence of the population being so much scattered, from a variety of causes, there is not so much prospecting going on as could be wished; but so many have benefited by the rich leads in this locality, that when other places fail they generally return, and not a few have realized their most sanguine expectations. A prospecting claim has been granted be tween Mitchell's Reef and the Canton Lead. Prospect off the bottom 19 dwt. per load. Pic-Nic Gully is nearly worked out, though there are still a few payable holes that have lately been discovered higher up the gully and nearer the dividing range. The machinery is as follows If capitalists could be induced to explore this extensive range, there is no doubt but quartz reefs of great value would be discovered. The surface indications are favorable, and I think it is quite clear this range has been the feeder of about twenty distinct leads, that have been worked with success during the last four and a half years. The Bull and Mouth Company, on the Upper Wet Lead, have completed the erection of a steam engine and puddling machinery, and have obtained a satisfactory prospect. Should the company be as successful as is an ticipated by miners well acquainted with the ground, I have no doubt it will be a great in ducement for other parties to erect steam ma chinery on the extensive, and only partially worked, leads and flats in this division. The Rising Sun Company, on the Black Lead, have erected a steam engine and are about to commence mining operations. Should this company be successful, of which there is little doubt, I trust ere long to see many steam engines at work on the extensive flat, which is supposed to contain the junction of the several leads running from the Kangaroo or Chalam ber Range.

The machinery is as follows Nos. 3 and 2 are yielding from 16 to 17 oz. of gold weekly ; each of these claims is wrought with a whim, and the parties consist of eight working miners. Claim No. 1 is worked out and abandoned; the total yield obtained from it was 140 oz. The prospectors, who have been for some time past driving in the reef below the level of the wash-dirt, recently broke through to gravel, and obtained 13 \\ oz. from the area uncovered for four sets of timber, i. e., 16 feet of their main drive.

The Royal Saxon Company are getting out wash-dirt supposed to be of good quality, but I have been unable to learn the results of their washing up.

The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 14s. 9d. to \u00a33 17s. 9d. per oz. The Prince of Wales Company's claim, from which a good prospect was said to be obtained last month at a depth of 112 feet, is idle at present, several of the shareholders having gone to New Zealand, and the others being too poor to procure an engine. No quartz mined or crushed in the division. There has been somewhat less activity in the deep sinking in this division during the month, in consequence of the departure of about forty of the mining population for the Tuapeka gold field. I may also mention that a like number have gone to Camgham, in con sequence of the high rate of wages recently offered there to hired miners. On the Cemetery Hill, the Fiery Creek Steam Sluicing Company, who recently aban doned their old claim on the Yam Hill, have extended their fluming to the new site, and recently recommenced sluicing operations with a fair prospect of success. On the Bumbank Hill, Holdsworth and Company are obtaining a good remuneration for their tunnelling and puddling operations. Considerable activity is displayed by the various sluicing and tunnelling companies, whose extended operations are yielding good returns : those portions of the old workings which are unsuitable for sluicing purposes from the peculiar nature of the wash-dirt, are being profitably reworked by the proprietors of horse puddling machines, many of whom pay a rent to the sluicing companies for the water they require to continue their vocation. On Jock's Lead and its tributaries, the prin cipal occupants are a few puddlers, and the White Star Whim Company : the latter, after sinking a shaft and obtaining good wages for a fortnight past, have just got swamped out by breaking into an old drive. The Shamrock and Thistle Company, on the upper margin of the Government Reservoir, are busily employed in shifting their engine and plant, an operation rendered necessary by their losing their original shaft, and having recently sunk a new one. The Chinese portion of the mining popula tion display considerable enterprise, and have recently erected several whims on ground pre viously abandoned by European miners. On the little rush which took place last month, between Sailors' and Unity Leads, now known as Bolton's Gully, about 40 miners are still employed ; the depth of sinking ranges from 20 to 45 feet, and the weekly dividends vary from \u00a31 to \u00a35 per man. The Champion of the Seas claim immediately abreast of the embankment of the reservoir has yielded 13J oz. of gold during the last fort night, and is likely to give a fair return for the labor and capital expended, as soon as the proprietors shall have completed their sluicing arrangements. On the Southern Cross Lead, the claims at the upper or south end of the lead, formerly known Cumberland Gully are of a very patchy The West of England Company have sold their engine and abandoned their claim ; the Description. i \u00a3 \u25a0z k s It K e.

On the Garibaldi Lead the prospectors, who have for a Ion g time been driving too deep in the reef, have recently broken through to wash-dirt, and having once more got their drive to a right level, obtained 17\u00a3 oz. of gold from the wash-dirt got out last week. The Flying Buck Company have recently completed the erection of their engine and plant, and as they had previously reached the edge of the gutter, and obtained a prospect of 8 dwt. to the load by driving, this claim cannot fail to yield a speedy return to the share holders. The Royal Standard Company's claim, No. 1 North, on this lead has also been driven at too low a level. The gold obtained on breaking through to the gravel level was 5 oz. 2 dwt , from 12 trucks of wash-dirt; and the company declared a dividend of \u00a31 per man last week, after paying up all expenses previously in arrear. The Raglan Company's claim continues to yield 12 oz. of gold to the weekly washing. A party of Chinese have recently taken up a large area of ground, and commenced the erection of a whim, just above the Raglan Company's Claim. The Olive Branch Company have driven far too deep in the reef, and having discovered their mistake by putting in an incline, have obtained 3\u00a3 oz. of gold from six loads of wash dirt ; are now employed in forming a new main drive. Several parties of Chinese miners are doing well near the junction of Close's Gully with the Main Lead. Near Payne's store, where the lead shallows to 40 feet, four parties of Chinese have re cently taken up large areas of ground left as non- payable in golden times by European miners, from which they are obtaining good wages. The Great Republic Company have mastered the water, bottomed their shaft, sunk the well, and are just opening out their main drive. On the Upper Main Lead a number of puddling machines, and a few tub and cradle men find profitable employment, and the Dancing Feather and Ph\u0153nix Sluicing Com panies are netting handsome profits for the labor they employ near Golden Point. On the Main Deep Lead but little gold is getting in the claims at the eastern end of the flat. The Britannia Company's claim has ceased working for the present. The Beaufort Company's claim and the Little Allandale claim are also at a stand still, the shareholders seeming to doubt whether or not it will be worth their while to erect machinery, and being unable to prosecute their operations without it. Of the tributary leads, the Ding-Dong has partly fallen, by purchase, into the hands of Chinese, the only Europeans at work there being the prospectors, who continue to make handsome dividends. On McCooke's Lead the prospect claim con tinues to yield an oz. to the load, independent of the yield of gold obtained from cement. The Allandale Company (Calvert and party), still continue their operations with great vigor, and expect to be able to prove the ground by the end of November. On the Argyle Lead, the Better-Late-than- Never and Chinese whim claims continue to yield a fair return, and the proprietors intend to drive for the main lead when they have worked out their frontage on the Argyle. The Golden Age Company have recently obtained a little gold, and are engaged in putting in a new drive as their old one is too shallow. The small number of men employed is the only reason that this party has been so long in proving the lead, as their claim is situate on the narrowest part of the flat. On New Charcoal the whim claim still yields good wages. At Nuggety Gully, the Red Hill Sluicing Company are doing well. The Fiery Creek Company have recently obtained a few ounces of gold from the dirt tested, but have not yet reached the gutter, which is a long way to the westward of their shaft. At Old Jonathan's Gully, the Wimmera Sluicing Company are making handsome re turns. Old Tipperary Gully and its branches em ploy a number of tub and cradle men, both European and Chinese. The Marco Polo Company's dividends have fallen off lately. The company are driving to the westward for the deep ground. The Royal Oak Company, recently working on the Argyle Lead, have sunk two shafts Old Musical Gully is being advantageouslv re-worked by fossickers, principally Chinese. \""], [438, "414 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 SEPTEMBER. At Waterloo and Bill's Hills, Watkins and Bill's Sluicing Companies are making fair returns, and one or two puddling machines in the same locality are paying well. At Raglan Proper, the Old Surface Hill has recently yielded a 20 oz. nugget from three feet sinking ; several tub and cradle men are washing 1\u00a3 dwt. to the tub in this neighbor hood. The West of England Sluicing Company (Jury and party) are still profitably employed at Surface Point. Harrison's Gully also affords profitable employment to a few puddlers. \u25a0* At Charlton and Sulky Flat, five puddling machines are profitably employed, and a few tub and cradle men yet manage to get a good living from the old ground. On the Wet Lead but one claim is at work, and the mining population of this locality has dwindled down to 52. At New Jonathan's Gully the prospect claim is re-occupied by a new party, and, with the claim adjoining, \"is yielding good wages. At Wingfield's Gully, the Chinese whim party are still doing well. The Great Extended Company have a 14 horse-power engine at work on the claim, and, as they have not yet succeeded in getting any wash-dirt equal to that from which the first prospect was obtained, suspicions are enter tained by the shareholders that the wash-dirt was \" salted \" by a mate who sold out. At Waterloo, the sluicing company recently at work on the edge of the lagoon known as the Black Swamp, have suspended operations, as the locality does not pay. At Shicer Gully a small population still make wages from the old ground. At Paddy's Gully, Lightfoot and Company have recently purchased the West of England Company!s engine (12 horse-power) for \u00a3300, and intend erecting it forthwith. The Golden Gate Company have jnst started a 9 horse-power engine, so that this locality will get a fair trial. On Old Charcoal Lead, the Princess Royal Company, whose claim yielded a prospect of 6 dwt. to four buckets of dirt last month, have ceased working, as the washing of twenty loads of dirt only gave a return of 2 oz. 7 dwt. 13 gr. At New Musical, the Queen of England Company have been compelled to desert their claim for want of funds to obtain an engine. The whim claim was recently washing 12 oz. to the machine.

I have the honor to report that during the past month mining operations in this division have been pursued with unabated energy ; indeed, from the favorable results of the various companies engaged in deep lead mining, this branch of industry begins to get into great favor, and notwithstanding the laborious nature of the work, the great difficulties in the shape of rock and water to be battled with, and the large amount of capital necessarily required for the successfully carrying on the operations, new companies are being formed, old ones re-organised, and any available ground for claims in close proximity with the paying claims is being sought for with a great deal of anxiety. No. 2. Division. (P. C. Fitzpatrick, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Some of the companies have not thought it dishonorable to avail themselves of the igno rance, inattention, perhaps, of some of the com panies who have been hard at work for the past four years, by jumping portions of their claims on the plea that these portions of claims had not been properly taken up under the 77 th clause of the Gold Fields Act. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 I have to report the discovery of a new tributary gutter struck by the Republic Com pany. Inkermann Lead This tributary, differ ent from that discovered by the Royal Saxon Company, has been discovered on the south side of the lead: its course seems to be about S. 25\u00b0 W. The appearance of the washing stuff is little different from that in the main lead, but it is ascertained to be very much richer. The company have also come across some very rich cement, \u2014 a crushing of 60 tons turned out 39 oz. 17 dwt. of gold of a coarse and nuggety description. Since these dis coveries the value of shares in this company has greatly increased. I have nothing new to report as regards the operations of the various other companies. They are continuing their operations steadily, and those who are raising gold have, I believe, no reason to complain of their success. Total value of all mining plant in the division, \u00a326,000.

It might, perhaps, be interesting to remark that several large pieces of gold have been met with by this company in breaking down the reef : I have not had an opportunity of seeing the situation the gold occupied in the quartz, but have been told that, in some in stances, pieces varying from a quarter of an ounce to 12 dwt. have been broken out of the solid stone. I have the honor to forward the following report for the month of October: \u2014 The Black Hill Company will soon complete the erection of their large battery of 60 head of stamps: they have got all the machinery on the ground, and expect to be ready for crushing in about three weeks.

Since then some five or six companies have been re-organised and have re-commenced work, and there is every reason to suppose that they will be successful. Try Again, late Hopewell, East India Cement Company, Cornish United Company, Speedwell Company, Donnybrook Company, Poverty Point Company, Welcome Nugget Company, Fire Brigade Company, Norwegian Company, Golden Gate, Prince Albert, Golden Point Cement Company, Hing Sing and party, The great drawback to the companies under their former system of work was the large amount of debt which was due for the plant. Many of the companies were commenced by working men, who had to obtain the machinery requisite for working the claim upon credit, and thus they were constantly impeded by a weight of debt which they found impossible to get rid of. Had the quartz proved uniformly rich, they would doubtless have succeeded in clearing themselves, but every falling off in the yield was felt with tenfold force, owing to the inces sant payments which had to be made by way of interest for money borrowed, or as instal ments of the debt for machinery. Little Gun Company. It affords me much satisfaction to report that there is a very perceptible improvement in quartz mining since last month. The disastrous effect which the rush to New Zealand had upon mining enterprise generally, but more especially upon quartz mining, may now be said to have passed away, and opera tions are being resumed with wonted energy. It is not surprising that under these circum stances many of the men lost heart and mag nified each falling off in the yield, and that when the news of the discovery of gold in New Zealand arrived, many rushed to that place, Name of Company.

T he result was that several companies were wound up. plant was sold, and the shareholders dispersed. No. 4 Division. (Michael O'Malley, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Indeed, quartz mining came to be considered as a failing speculation, and there was some thing like general distrust. Since however the claims have changed hands, a more cheerful feeling has arisen, and operations are now being resumed with system and energy. It would be simply absurd to say that one-half the lodes have been tested. Shafts have in some instances been sunk to a depth of 150 and 200 feet, and drives have been put in, but we still know nothing of the quality of the quartz at greater depths, or of the general character of the majority of the lodes at the depths I have named. Want of adequate capital has led to the abandonment of many a claim. The working man has been unable to overcome the first great difficulties and the quartz has been pro nounced too poor. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Now, however, that many companies have been re-organised, it is quite possible that quartz mining may receive a new impetus and be prosecuted with greater success than before. As an illustration of what I have said, I may mention the recent discovery made by the Wellingtonia Gigantia Company, on the Black Hill Flat. This company was for a long time very un fortunate, the quartz struck in the upper levels having proved, so far as tried, unprofitable. The company then determined to sink deeper. and at a depth of about 250 feet they opened out a new level. In this the lode was again struck, and some specimens obtained which I have rarely seen surpassed in richness. Total value of all mining plant in the divison, \u00a343,800. The crushing gave a most satisfactory yield, and I need hardly say that the company is working with renewed vigor. This is one among many instances of how near the success may be even when failure seems certain. Number of square miles of alluvial ground which is being or may have been actually worked upon, |. Number of distinct quartz reefs which have been actually proved to be auriferous to the present time, 5 ; only 2 presently worked. The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 18s. 6d. to \u00a33 18s 9d. per oz. In alluvial mining there are no changes to report. Some attention has recently been given to the subject of prospecting, and proposals have been made for the formation of a prospecting association. The rush to Break o'Day Hill referred to in my last report still continues to cause con siderable excitement in that neighborhood. Some seven or eight companies are making good wages, about \u00a3 t per man weekly ; but the prospectors are doing much better. They have already obtained about \u00a32400 from their claim, or \u00a3600 per man within the last ten months, and are in expectation of having Experience would seem to show that such associations cannot be worked with economy, and they are not likely to be well received by the public. There is, however, undoubtedly a large area of shallow ground outside my dis trict which has never been thoroughly tried. Occupalion.

Deep Leads \u2014 Frenchman's and White Horse. \u2014 The several companies on these leads are in about much the same condition as already reported. The Red Jacket Company, however, have been of late getting up some better stuff than at the date of my last report. Moreover, the very important suit between them and the Nelson Company referred to by me some time ago, has been decided a few days since in favor of the latter, so that it is to be hoped litigation is now at an end so far as these leads are concerned. eight or ten more months' work before them ere the claim is finished. About a fortnight since they got as much as 112 oz. of gold in one week, and in it was included a 45-oz. nugget ; they are working at a depth of only seven or eight feet from the surface, though the sinking is abont 60 feet where the run is presently traced to, at the boundary of Mr. Elder's property, which was attempted to be rushed a few days since by some miners from the outlying districts ; but upon the appear ance of a few troopers on the ground they speedily retired. There are about eighty men presently at work, and if the private property were available, four times that number would be employed. The rush to Bull Dog Hill also continues to do well. There is a settled down population here of about 400 miners, and about sixty companies are in receipt of gold, the majority of whom are making good wages, with some few who are doing still belter. For instance, a few days since one company obtained 39 oz. from seventeen loads of stuff; but this, I must gay, is the best yield that I have heard of. The sinking varies from 20 to 25 feet, and, as a general rule, the best returns are obtained from the shallower depths. The washing stuff also varies from 4 inches to 2 feet in depth, and extends in width about 250 or 300 feet. The Working Miners' Company, after bat tling with a very heavy drift during the last three or four months, have at length succeeded in getting through it, and reaching the bottom at the great depth of nearly 400 feet from the surface. The company are in high hopes of a long and prosperous future ; and from the ex traordinary depth which they have reached before bottoming, they expect to be quite near the gutter or gutters, for it is very likely there will be a junction of three leads in the neigh borhood of their shaft. Moreover this com pany are more fortunate than their neighbors (the Nelson and Red Jacket Companies) in two very important respects, namely, being likely to steer clear of litigation, and having a claim about four times as large (man for man) as either of these companies, so that shares may be expected to command high prices in the event of good prospects being obtained. The present price, I believe, is upwards of \u00a31000, and if things look promising upon striking gold, double that sum will be given. There is nothing new to report of Cobbler's Lead, except that the Camp Company have divided as much as \u00a334 per man for the last fortnight from the tributary lead discovered while working their old claim a couple of months since, and referred to in last month's report. The old gullies in the vicinity of these two rushes are now totally abandoned, and it is much to be hoped some further discoveries mil be made ere their former inhabitants re visit them ; indeed, if some more new ground is not soon opened in this part of the district, the place will, nay must, be abandoned ere many months, as the old gullies have been so often turned over that the very Chinamen themselves are unable to work them any longer with profit. Whim Holes\u2014 Little Hard Hills, &c\u2014 The Heart and Hand Cement Crushing Company still continue to realise pretty fair returns as to the quantity crushed; but they find it difficult to get out sufficient stuff to keep their battery going, owing to the patchy nature of the ground. With the exception of this company, however, and a few puddling companies scat tered through the neighboring old gullies, who are making tolerable wages, dullness appears the order of the day all over this portion of the division ; for although gold can be gene rally found scattered over a large tract of country, with the defective appliances pre sently in use for saving fine gold, the miners say they cannot work it with anything like paying results; and, consequently, such as have the means, are seriously thinking of turning their attention to farming, ere what ever little savings may have been effected in the \" good old times \" shall have been frittered awav. The Prince of Wales Company are still en gaged putting in their new level, and expect to reach Cobbler's gutter in the course of six or eight weeks, as they have now completely beaten down the great body of water by which they were swamped out previous to the pur chase of their new machinery, and are in a fair way of pushing their works ahead. Shares in this company also command high prices, about \u00a3750, I am told, has been refused. The Alston and Weardale, and Scottish and Cornish Companies are, as already reported, busily engaged ; the former putting in a level (already 465 feet in length) for the gutter, and the latter erecting their new machinery which they expect to have completed by the end of the month.

The North German Reef, a little to the west ward of Smythesdale township, has contributed not a little to dissipate the apprehension with which reefing has been undertaken lately here. Mining prospects have not been so encouraging as usual during the past month Some claims which had been only a short time since looked forward to with hopeful expectations have been abandoned. The prospecting party crushed during the month 80 tons for a trial and got 74 oz. there from. Of this number the British Workman quartz claim at Browne's may be cited. A great amount of money has been fruitlessly expended on it on the faith of the alluring prospects which the reef held out at and within a short distance from the surface. The cessation of this claim puts a stop to the whole of the Mullachy Point Reef, unless the Success Com pany renew operations.

Wales Company have got into the gutter at a depth of 96 feet ; the last machine washed yielded 13 oz. 11 dwt. The Werribee Fly or Prospecting Company average 7 oz. per ma chine. The persons working an intermediate claim between these two are Italians, and will not give accurate information ; but there is suffi cient evidence that they are doing well from the energetic manner in which the several parties of their countrymen down the lead have set to work. The Smythesdale Company, adjoining %e Prince of Wales Company, have also just struck the gutter, but on account of the quantity of water intend to erect an engine immediately. The proprietors of the steam puddling mill in Bullarook continue to do well, their weekly average for six men being 18 oz. The Bonnie Dundee Company, whose claim is nearly a third of a mile south of the Hit or Miss Company, have also bottomed at a depth of 63 feet, and obtained payable gold. The three claims which intervene between this and the Hit or Miss claim will shortly bottom. From the different depths at which the different claims have got gold, it is evi dent that the gold is being traced from the deepest ground in the Sons of Justice Com pany's claim to where it commences in the ranges, and companies are in course of forma tion to work the private property adjacent to the latter claim, and through which the deep ground must pass. At Graham's Hill the miners also continue to make good wages, and another company (Moss and party) have struck paying ground on the hill. At Lonstone Hill, Slaty Creek, the three parties who have hitherto got gold are doing well. Bell and party have also struck the vein of gold in their claim near the creek, and on the opposite side of the creek, along the side of the ridge overhanging it, and known as Caine's Hill, the continuation of this vein has been proved for about half a mde by tun nels driven into the side of the ridge ; it will again cross the creek near Forty-foot Hill, but it has already been worked at this latter place. The Sons of Justice have not yet completed the erection of their machinery. The Better- Late-than-Never and Great Eastern Companies have commenced puddling. The New Independent have raised a quantity of wash-dirt, and are putting up a puddling machine ; but none of these companies have any returns for the month. The following are the quantities obtained by the different companies during October : \u2014 Towards the end of the month a few parties have taken up claims at J amieson's or Ryrie's Creek, about a mile north of Frenchman's Gully ; sufficient work has not yet been done to test the value of the ground. The Prospecting Company (eight men), 23 oz. 12 dwt.; the Northern Lights Company (eight men), 45 oz. 3 dwt 13 gr.; the Alliance Company (eight men), 170 oz.; the Home ward Bound Company (nine men), 194 oz. 6 dwt. 15 gr. ; the Garibaldi Company (eight men), 93 oz 14 dwt. 1 gr. ; the Rise and Shine Company (sixteen men), 216 oz. 16 dwt 21 gr. It will be seen from the table of the detailed returns for quartz crushed, that the Hard Hill Company are crushing quartz from the Armagh Reef. As, however, the company have to cart the stone about three miles, the return of 3 dwt. 6 gr. per ton cannot pay. The company intend to give the reef a full trial before either erecting machinery on the spot or abandoning it. The Prospecting Company have also struck a quartz reef in their claim, and a company is formed to work it. The Havilah Lead, which was abandoned, has again been taken up by some of the original prospectors. There are indications that it con nects with the Bald Hills Lead about the Great Eastern or Better-Late-than-Never Companies' claims. The present parties believe they will be more successful on the reef or shallow ground than in the deep ground. The Band of Hope Company have let a contract for raising cement, the contractors to receive half the yield of gold. This is the first contract of the kind, that I am aware of, let on Creswick. Clunes Mining. \u2014 I have the honor to observe that those mines in this portion of my district which have heretofore proved dividend-paying On the Rocky Lead, Bullarook, the Prince of"], [453, "427 MINING SUEVEYORS EEPOETS\u2014 OCTOBER. claims, continue to be profitably worked, and that four companies are applying themselves to perfect their machinery, which has proved inadequate to ensure success. Criterion Company have crushed during the past four weeks, 815 tons of quartz, which yielded 637 ozs. 1 dwt. 1 1 grs. of gold, averag ing per ton, 15 dwts. 15 grs. They are still working Robinson's Reef, and have started to sink their main shaft other 70 feet deeper, they have but little water at present, which is kept down by a 165 gallon tank, which fills itself at the bottom, and by a self acting apparatus empties on the top. They have dispensed with metal guides for the stamp lifters, finding tim ber more economical and better in every res pect. They have paid four several dividends in the month, amounting together to \u00a3160 per share, they employ 45 men on the average. The Port Phillip Company during the past week have crushed 2,608 tons of quartz, which yielded 1,224 ozs 9 dwts. 16 grs. of bar gold, showing an average per ton of 9 dwts. 9 grains. They are testing the application of a revolving blanket to one of their batteries, which is worked by a belt from the main shaft with reducing gear, the company are not yet in possession of the result. In the turnery and smiths' shops the company's artisans are en tirely engaged at the iron work required to finish the model battery for the London exhi bition, this will be complete in about 14 days. The battery is now put together in the com pany's large shed, which was erected for the purpose ; the workmanship reflects the highest credit on the company's employes, the joints of the large timbers having been closed with the exactness of cabinet work. Yankee Quartz Mining Company have crushed 500 tons, which have given an average of J oz. per ton. Their workings on the Wel come Reef, which is seven feet wide, have not been so paying as was anticipated. On the Eastern Reef there is no variation. Their oper ations on the Western Reef, not Robinson's as before stated, are continued. I may here mention that both Robinson's and the Old Man lodes dip considerably just before entering this claim, they may doubtless be found in depth ; they employ 40 men. Clunes Quartz Mining Company \u2014 The Welcome Reef \u2014 In driving north on the No. 1 level, this lode was found to dip and run out, from this level to the No. 2, 70 feet down, they are sinking a winze for the purpose of getting air. On this second level they are driving in the lode up to the northern boundary, the stone still looks well, the width of the reef is 9 to 10 feet. Victoria Quartz Mining Company. \u2014 They have crushed in fortnight ending 19 th October, 294 tons, which yielded 254 ozs. 8 dwts. of gold, at an average per ton of 17 dwts. 7 grs. Sub sequently they have reduced 250 tons, the pro ceeds of which is not yet known, but from the amalgam obtained is likely to be over an ounce per ton. They have expended \u00a31001 the past four weeks, and employed 62 men. To four heads of their stampers they have tried box wood for guides to the lifters in place of metal V guides, and state that the use of wood is preferable both on the score of economy and efficiency. Robinson's Reef.\u2014 A great portion of the quartz raised at this time is from this lode, its width varies from 5 to 30 feet, five parties are engaged upon it. Eastern Reef. \u2014 The chief workings on this lode are towards the south, the poorest portion of the same. Western Reef. \u2014 Five separate parties are working this lode, each of six to twelve persons. They are working the Eastern Reef as hereto fore, it is six feet wide, and the stone raised from it looks very good. In making a crosscut from this lode, No. 3 level, to strike the Wel come Reef, they cut two feet to the east a reef nine feet thick ; this has not been seen in the No. 2 workings. I am impressed with the opinion that this separation is of a local charac ter, and that more northerly the two veins will form again into a compact body. I have men tioned that they also cut a band of quartz on this level, which intersects the Welcome Reef, of seven feet thickness, not yet tested. The Welcome Reef, on the No. 3 level, averages five feet wide ; on the No. 2 level this lode was also struck, they are still driving across it, and are in 20 feet, with no symptoms of the opposite wall at present, the stone appears to be highly auriferous. Old Man Reef, as before stated, is excessively hard and not worth working at present, the quartz contains an immense quantity of iron pyrites, and it is very probable that as soon as a proper mode cau be discovered to extract gold from this metal with economy, that this reef will prove second in value to none other in the paddock. The new mining engine and winding gear to work the main shaft is in position and com pletely fitted, but it will not be started till the pipes are fixed and the pumping gear complete. Men are engaged preparing to sink the shaft to the full depth of 600 feet. The engine and boiler houses are very substantial and_ complete buildings, accommodation is also afforded for the miners and pitmen to change, in need ; they employ 140 men on the average.

The pre sent arrangements will allow the company to sink deeper at any period. tons per week, which yield scarcely 1 dwt. per ton, their trials showed 7 dwts. It is their in tention to have the battery thoroughly over hauled and repaired. New North Clunes Company are making alterations for the fixing of the pumping gear, at present they are not sinking the shaft. The Pioneer Company are still prospecting their claim. Gordon Division. (J. B. Cusack, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The 25 tons of quartz taken from the reef struck in sinking the shaft, and tested by the Port Phillip Company, produced 5 dwts. 3 grs. per ton. At the depth of 263 feet they struck another reef, which was not proved. The crushing engine has been thoroughly repaired and considerably altered to better adapt it for its purpose, the battery is still un dergoing repair, they have had to renew almost everything. A pipe has been attached to fill the boiler in a short time from a water reserve, which will also be available in case of fire. Around the machinery are fixed rails as a pro tection from accident. The entire arrangments of this company are of a very complete character. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Clunes United Quartz Mining Company have crushed in the month 242 tons, which yielded 96 oz. of gold, at per ton 7 dwt. 22 grs., number of men employed, 32. It is the intention of this company in a fort night to take down the present battery and stamping engine, and to erect a twenty-four head iron framed battery with iron lifters, the present engine will be removed and placed so that the crushing works may be extended. Another boiler will be added and they will be built into a position 6 feet lower than the site of the present boiler, in order to get wood conveyed to them with more economy. During these alterations the mining works will be discontinued and the shaft put down in the interim not less than 1 00 feet deeper. They have concluded for the purchase of a 22-inch cylinder engine for pumping, two boilers, the present 15 horse-power engine will be retained as a winding engine. Very massive timbers are on the ground for the foundations of these works. Total value of all mining plant in the division, \u00a38000.

They are taking about three feet of the surface, which they find aver age 6 dwts. to the load. This they find would pay them good wages if the party were stronger. They have not as yet re-commenced working the reef. the eastern side. They are consequently taking out the whole reef which varies in width from five to nine feet. Mount Egerton \u2014Little Hill Reef.\u2014 The party who have taken up this reef since its abandonment by the Rose Company, are work ing out some old blocks at a depth of 145 feet, the yield of which from the last crushing of 30 tons was 1 oz. per ton. The thickness of the reef at these blocks is three feet. They have got some indications of new leaders which they intend to test as soon as possible. Kangaroo Reef. \u2014 This company have not been working in the mines for the past month owing to the general alteration they are making in the machinery. They have removed the old dry stamping battery and Chilian mills, and are about erecting a battery of eight stamps, wet crushing. They also intend raising the level of the stamper beds in order to give greater fall to their tables. Big Hill. \u2014 No. 2 claim have crushed 25 tons from a depth of 200 feet, yielding 22 dwt. to the ton. The width of the reef is about 7 feet. The north end of the reef worked by Reid, Courtis, and Company, under lease No. 127, are taking out old blocks at 30 feet, 80 feet, and 96 feet, respectively. The average yield as reported to me is 5 dwt. per ton This yield appears to me exceedingly small when com pared with yields from other portions of the same reef. It may be partially accounted for from the fact that a large quantity of slate and mullock, containing but little gold, was mixed up with the quartz. The new plant is now on the ground and they expect to re-commence work in about a month. Parker's Reef. \u2014 The company who have taken up this reef (the ground held by lessees Nos. 106 and 1 13) are busy raising quartz from a depth of 100 feet. They have now about 300 tons on the surface stacked and ready for burning, only wanting the completion of the machinery, and which would have been com pleted by this time but for some delay at the foundry. Alluvial. \u2014 Potter and party (Steam Puddling Company), are progressing as usual, going through about 80 loads a day of their surfacing. The average yield per load is 12 grs. The depth of the surface taken by them is from 8 to 12 feet. They find the gold equally dis tributed through the clay from the surface to the slate rock. In the former working of this reef the miners only took out the eastern side, having concluded (without much investigation) that the western side contained no gold, or at least would not be remunerative enough to work. This party however have found that the western side is quite as good as any quartz they can find in The only party who were working in All Nations Gully have for the present abandoned their shaft, in consequence of being swamped out by the water breaking in them from the old workings.

The whole of the ground on this reef north and south is occupied, and operations vigorously proceeded with. The Yankee Reef Company have again crushed some mullock, which averaged nearly the same as the last, 3 dwt. per ton. The Perseverance Company have suspended their operations at the end of the last week: their capital is, I believe, expended, and I imagine, in the present state of mining pro spects, there will be some difficulty in raising a capital for further working and testing their ground. The New Year's Reef Company have from a crushing of 30 tons obtained a yield of 31 oz. per ton; much less than was expected, as the vein has hitherto given from 5 to 1 1 oz. per ton ; the quartz, however, now crushed was from the upper ground, that in the water looks first-rate. The Cosmopolite Company still idle, pending the granting of lease. A new vein has been opened to the west of the Morning Star Company's ground, which the prospectors have called the Evening Star Reef. I have had no opportunity of seeing any of the specimens, as the parties have just returned from New Zealand, and have scarcely had time to develop it. The Steiglitz Company have at last deter mined to wind up the affairs of their mine, and pay off all their liabilities. The Malakhoff Company still busily working their deep ground, which is the richest yet found in their claim ; they have been engaged in crushing their quartz continuously during the month, but have not yet completed them ; so I am unable to state results. The Homeward Bound Reef is again occu pied ; its name is changed to the Bright Planet this also belongs to a return party from New Zealand. The Blacksmith's Reef is taken up by a party of Germans who intend to test the ground thoroughly, previous to sinking a main shaft and forming a company. The specimens I have seen are very good. The Gibraltar Company are continually meeting with accidents and drawbacks in the erection of their pumping apparatus : the manager informs me that he has no doubt now that the difficulties in such erection are now overcome, and that blocking out the ground already opened will commence next week. There have been two or three small rushes in the neighborhood of Dolly's Creek, which are yielding first-rate returns. It is now no unusual occurrence to hear of nuggets as much as 10 oz in weight being found The character of the gold is altogether different from that formerly found, which is another indication of its certain permanency and improvement. The Redan Company have finished crushing the mullock from their ground (raised), and have issued tenders for removing and raising to the surface the quartz and mullock stowed away in the old workings. The crushing, on the average, has paid well and employed a large number of men. On Morrison's mining matters are still favor able, the deeper the tunnels are carried into the table land the better the results. The same will apply to the Tea-tree Creek diggings. The New Chum Company have cleared out part of their workings of mullock, and, after a careful survey, have determined on the site for sinking a prospect shaft for the purpose of picking up the veins supposed to be lost. Their machine is crushing the mullock so raised, which is paying well. The East Moorabool diggings have been comparatively abandoned owing to the New Zealand rush, a few of the original holders have, however, returned and set in again to their abandoned ground. The Morning Star Company are again alter ing their gold collecting and amalgamating process, which has hitherto proved a complete failure. They have lost a great deal of gold, and their past experience does not appear to have benefited them much. Numbers of applications have been made for races and water privileges ; from the irtony Rises Creek to the diggings ; from Mount Doran Creek to diggings ; from Clarendon Gully to Green Hills and diggings; so there is every chance of all this large tract of country, about which I wrote you some time since, being well and successfully worked. The Wellington Reef Company are raising quartz which will be crushed next week; the appearance of it is similar, as to quality, to that before raised, and will average from 1 J to 2 oz. per ton. The Hit and Miss Company are doing re markably well; there is no doubt this is one of the most paying companies in the distr ct, and the management is well conducted. The Albion Company\u2014 still progressing most satisfactorily ; working their deep ground and continually crashing ; the average yield of quartz 5 oz per ton, and the vein looking first rate both in size and quality. Alluvial mining on Steiglitz has been paying the few engaged in it very well during the month, the yield is about 3 dwt. per tub. C 2"], [458, "432 MINING SUB-VETOES' EEPOETS \u2014 OCTOBEE. The general state of this division is in my opinion satisfactory, and when the numerous quartz mining companies get well into working order, which I trust will be in a few weeks, there is no doubt but that the population will be much larger, and Steiglitz gold field be second to none in the district.

The cause of this suspension is, as I understand, want of funds. sign of moving, but the manager still seems to hope that they will soon go on. The Simmons' Reef Quartz Mining Com pany's works also remain dormant, and, I believe, not likely to move soon.' Appleton Brothers have almost suspended operations, they are doing but very little. The Cornish Company have not been in full work during the month but are now steadily at it, and likely so to continue while the supply of water keeps up. I have no hesitation in saying that each would be remunerative if properly carried on. The New Zealand mania having now almost entirely cooled down, and most of the absentees having returned, the sluicers have become more tranquil and reconciled to their lot than they were during the arrival of exciting news from the fancied El Dorado. Williams and Company have been doing a good stroke of business for this month having crushed 600 tons by four stampers. This stuff having been taken from the very crop or out break of the reef; the yield is very small (2 dwt .), but there is still a profit even from this. Sluicing has been and continues to be more than usually successful. One company of six men in particular have been for some time and still are making on the average \u00a320 per week per man, and many others are doing extremely well. Johnson's Reef. \u2014 Caledonian Company's works are now stopped, whether to move again or not I am not aware. The yield was small for the last crushings (2 dwt ) as in the case of Williams and Company, with this difference as to the result, one yielding a profit whilst the other was worked at a dead loss. Some fine nuggets have been found during the month, one of a pound weight was dug out a few feet below the surface at Ballan Flat, and three more have been got, the last of which 1J oz. in weight. Trewhella's Reef. \u2014 The Pioneer Company have been going on steadily during the month and are continuing to do so under favorable prospects and their yield continues good. These facts occurring almost simultaneously with the return of the deluded and disap pointed adventurers from New Zealand, and there being as yet an abundant supply of water, will I think act as a stimulant to sluicing. The Concordia Company's works have been stopped from, as the manager informs me, some contractors who had to sink the shaft deeper having refused to proceed. The stop ping of these works appears to have an injurious effect upon the adjoining claim by causing the water to accumulate. Few, if any, districts offer greater facilities for successful alluvial diggings on a large scale than Blackwood, and yet there is no capital invested here in this class of mining beyond what is spent in the miners' time and labor. There is ample ground here, auriferously rich, which if taken up by capi talists to employ hired labor would return large profits. Hewson 's Reef. \u2014 Hewson and Company. This mine has not been in full work during the month, as far as getting quartz and crushing are concerned, but there appears to have been no want of activity in other respects. They have put up a new whim to lift the stuff, the mine being drained by a water level or adit. Simmons' Reef. \u2014 Commencing, as I usually do, with the Imperial Company's works on this reef, I regret to report that they still remain in a dormant state. The lately discovered Atkins' Reef. \u2014 One claim on this reef is about being opened effec tually and some quartz is now being landed looking likely to yield well, but as this mine is remote from any crushing machine no good can be done until one is erected on the spot, which the claimholders talk of doing. There has lately been a change in the management and I believe that preparations are about being made to erect a Chilian mill in addition to their stamping apparatus; but my opinion is that no good will be done here without pumping machinery to unwater the mine, instead of the expensive and inefficient means hitherto employed. There is another instance here of very pro ductive reefs being kept in abeyance for want of capital to erect machinery \u2014 Wilson's and Garibaldi Reefs both close together, but away some eight miles from the nearest machine, The Lerderderg Company's works show no"], [460, "MINING SUBYEYORS' EEPOETS \u2014 OCTOBEE. 434 and both highly auriferous, by trials made 6 oz. to the ton, but the claimholders have not the means, nor have they yet succeeded in raising the required capital, to erect crushing machinery.

Water, which was getting scarce, has, by some heavy falls of rain, become more plentiful. As much as If inches fell on the 30th ultimo. This, however, did much damage to some of the claims, de stroying the banks and filling in the workings. Some fine claims have been registered within the last week of new ground, situated at the foot of the Black Range, and about twenty miles S.S.W. of the parish of Oxley. The first claim taken up reports twelve feet sinking, of which eight feet is wash dirt, and as much as 1 pennyweight to the dish has been found. It is a creek claim, and they have six to ten sluice heads of water to work with. There is plenty of room for a large gold field in this locality, with an abund ant supply of water. The country is very rough, the ranges extending from the peaks of the Buffalo westward, past the King's River. I went and examined the country \u2014 it looks well for agold-field, but there appeared too few quartz reefs running through the schistose strata. On the Perseverance Lead seven claims are being worked with less than forty men Nos. 5 and 6 having been lately given up and abandoned. Four miles further on, at Paddy's Gully and the German Lead, not more than twenty men are working. Several new reefs have been taken up this month, where good prospects have been found, but until a quantity is crushed no thorough prospect can be had. The German crushing machine, with twelve stampers, and 12 to 16-horse power, situated on the Two-mile Creek, has commenced work ing in earnest within the last week, and there is some probability that a rival machine may be erected, as there are so many reefs lying between the Two and Three-mile Creeks.

All mining operations in both my divisions have been prosecuted with vigor during the past month ; a great number of claims however had to be registered dry for the want of the necessary element to work them with, the supply having fallen off considerably.

The population is as follows : \u2014 Quartz mining is rather at a standstill until such times as the machines shall be fully prepared to crush. On most of the reefs parties are raising stone in anticipation. One engine for pumping purposes on Staghorn Flat, is on the road, and it is to be hoped that the flat mil receive a thorough trial, as it is almost incredible that the run of gold should stop dead at Allan's, the flat immediately above, and which was proved to be so rich.

Jamieson gold field \u2014 Since the New Zealand excitement has ceased a great number of miners have come iuto this district, aud are daily increasing in numbers The creek and bank claims are for the most part paying very well, but it requires some outlay to work these with advantage, but when worked the yield is good. Quartz claims are being taken up both at Gafihey's Creek and on the Upper Goulburn, and in all cases they turn out well. The great drawback is the difficulty of getting machinery from the almost impassable nature of the country. The prospect of success is however such as to warrant a considerable outlay. Water power can be applied with advantage as there is abundance of it and the fall very considerable. There is plenty of good timber to be had everywhere, so that most of the heavier parts of the machinery can be made on the spot, and so save the expense of carriage. (H. C.

Since my last report (September) no mate rial change whatever has taken place in my district ; many of our old miners have returned from New Zealand, and have settled down again to their old occupations. The district, or rather the mining interest generally, seems to be rather in abeyance at present, but cer tainly by no means on the decline, which the accompanying returns for this month will show. The various reefs are being vigorously wrought, as is also the known remunerative alluvial ground. Sheepshead Reef. \u2014 The Union Company on this line are steadily persevering, and have been for the last five years the most staunch com pany on Bendigo. They are obtaining stone from the greatest depth they can attain for water, and with the aid of an ordinary horse whim they are following the good stone, which dips rapidly south, and is now almost below their grasp, but which will be easily accessible to them directly Mr. Wills starts his pumping engine, which is almost completed. Their pre sent stone is much over 1 oz. per ton, and they have crushed nothing under that figure for months back. Hustler's Reef. \u2014 Joseph and Company's claim on this line has within the last three months yielded some very fine stone ; they have had stone yielding 45 oz. per ton, and several crushings of 300, 200, and 100 oz., &c.

Tyson's Reef. \u2014 The Tyson's Reef Company are still raising stone, and also crushing for the public, which is principally confined to the claims on the reef. The reef is very large at their present level, but not very rich, although quite remunerative. The company are sinking their engine-shaft 300 feet deep, and are now 240 feet down. The Energetic Company, to the south and adjoining the above company, intend sinking their engine-shaft 400 feet deep (which depth they will require to strike the reef), so that the various claimholders on the line to the north will be able to work for years without being troubled with water. The two next claims north of the Tyson's Company are getting stone more or less remunerative, and all the others are either registered or held under lease, with but few at work. Victoria Reef\u2014 The Advance, the Prince Alfred, and the Albert, are getting very fine stone from the new reef which was lately dis covered ; and the Hercules, the Endeavor, the Specimen Hill Companies, and Ballerstedt and Son, are also getting continuous good dividend stone.

The claim on the Black Forest Reef, also therein mentioned, is a prospecting claim that has not very long opened ; it is situated on the ranges to the north of Eaglehawk, and the whole length of the reef is now taken up, and the prospecting claim is making a good return to its owners. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Another prospecting claim in the Whipstick Scrub has lately been reported to me as having struck gold ; this is the third in the neighborhood of the Flagstaff Hill within two months.

The prospectors continue to find gold, but beyond their claim matters are at a stand. Several parties are still at work at the Alma and on the Adelaide Lead, with various results. On the Old Main Lead, profitable employ ment is given to a few, and the locality between Maryborough Proper and Carisbrook is being successfully worked by a pretty numerous but scattered population. The population of the division remains very nearly the same as reported in September, very few attractions having apparently been presented to the miners here by the news from New Zealand or other quarters. The steady returns given to the quartz miners tend to their settlement and to check the propensity to rush from place to place on the vague reports which are too generally circulated on the different gold fields. Chinaman's Flat appears at present to excite the most interest of any place in the division, the Hit or Miss Company there having ob tained prospects which have induced them to apply for a lease of ten and a half acres of ground, part of which they formerly held as an extended claim under the local bye-laws. The security of tenure given by the bye-laws. however, being somewhat doubtful, the safer mode is to lease the ground, and the example of the Hit or Miss has been followed by two others, namely, the Magnum Bonum and the United Gold'Mining Companies, which have made applications for ground immediately adjoining the former's to the extent of eighteen acres. Amherst Division. (Chas. Cole, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 When the machinery proposed to be erected is on the ground, Chinaman's Flat will be raised to the most important position in the division; the gold found there being highly remunerative in quantity, as well as of a quality which leads to the supposition that some heavy deposits are to be met with there. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 During the month no fewer than seventeen prospecting claims have been registered \u2014 six on quartz reefs, and the remaining eleven in alluvial ground ; chiefly shallow, and with prospects varying from half an ounce to an ounce and a half to the load, and situated in different parts of the division. On Gibraltar Hill there are two companies, the Welcome and the White Star, consisting each of sixteen shareholders, who are erecting machinery for the purpose of draining and working the old ground. The White Star has already commenced work with satisfactory prospects, and the Welcome will shortly be in a state to commence operations also. Towards the southern part of the division, mining matters appear on the average to be dull ; at any rate, there has been recently nothing new or interesting to take notice of.

The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 17s. 6d. to \u00a33 18s. 3d. per oz. The old ground generally yields employment to a considerable population ; especially may be noticed the Lucknow Lead, which has been rediscovered at a depth of 77 feet; prospect, 1 oz. to the load. As was observed some tune ago, there is a probability of the Lucknow and the Havelock Leads forming a junction. Of the latter itself, nothing very favorable can at present be said. Occupation.

In claims Nos. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21, the main lead has at length been struck, and in each instance looks very promising. The share holders, who but a short time ago began to despair, now look forward with confidence to being well rewarded for the time and labor which they have expended in searching for it. Being down a few of these shafts the other day, I was quite surprised at the richness of some portions of the auriferous earth ; the greatest quantity of gold appeared to be distributed through a black vein of cemented gravel about 2 inches thick, and which lay about 2 feet above the bed rock. The face of this vein seemed literally gilt with the precious metal, and continued as far as I could see, in one uninterrupted line. The earth above and below the vein is composed of white quartz grit and gravel, intermixed with large quartz boulders. \u00ab Idle. Charge per ton for crushing quartz, 13s. Charge per ton for crushing cement, 9s In furnishing my report for the present month I have the honor to state that the pros pects of the miners generally are nearly as bright as heretofore, particularly those working in the alluvial ground. In the neighborhood of the Amherst and Mia Mia Flats, many parties are doing exceedingly well, and as a consequence these places retain their average share of the population. The shareholders informed me that they take from 3 to 4 feet in depth of this earth, and that their last crushing yielded 2 oz. per ton. The sinking is from 95 to 100 feet. Mount Greenock Lead. \u2014 On this lead the United Britons are raising very good wash dirt ; about a fortnight ago they had a washing of 20 loads which yielded 56 oz. of gold ; amongst the sample was a nugget weighing 8 oz. In the adjoining claim the shareholders would have had a washing ere this had they not been engaged in erecting a horse-whim; they are now raising wash-dirt estimated to yield 2 oz. per load. On Rocky Flat Lead, where things were rather dull of late, a reaction has taken place; nine (9) frontage claims which were for a con siderable tune abandoned, have been within the last few days reoccup'ed. and some of them by returned miners from New Zealand. The Black Ball Company finding it im possible to bottom their shaft with horse power, put in a drive above water level in hopes of striking the reef, which they suc ceeded in doing after driving 1 60 feet ; they obtained gold but not sufficient to pay. By getting through a stratum of cement which lies on the bed rock, they were enabled to follow The majority are sinking with vigor, and the merits or demerits of this portion of the lead which is designated Rocky Flat East, will soon be known.

They consider there is ground convenient to them 40 feet deeper than they are at present, which is 110 feet. The adjoining claim, which is situated at an eleva tion of about 70 feet above them, is now down 60 feet, and is expected to go at least 200 feet before the bed rock is reached. From present appearances there is no doubt but the lead runs directly through the centre of the Mount, and I am of the opinion, could the miners be induced to prospect to the south of the Mount, that a large gold field would be discovered, sufficient in extent to afford employment to some thousands for a length of time. At the present slow rate which the lead is advancing it will take a - long time to trace it to the opposite side, as the Mount is over three quarters of a mile in extent.

Quartz Mining. \u2014 Some little time ago a party named Baker and Company, in sinking for alluvial gold, discovered a reef at the depth of 14 feet from the surface, supposed to be a con tinuation of the Star Reef, Amherst. Their crushings since the first discovery have aver aged 1 oz. 2 dwt. to the ton ; the last of 5 tons yielded I oz. 17 dwt. to the ton. The reef is from 10 to 12 feet in thickness; and the depth at which the quartz is at present obtained, is 25 feet. A new reef has been discovered a quarter of a mile to the south of Mount Glas gow, at a depth of 20 feet from the surface, 2 tons have been crushed and yielded in the aggregate 3 oz. 6 dwt. 12 grs. ; the reef has not yet been named. I beg to forward you report for this month. Since my last, a considerable decrease has taken place in the population of this division of the district, owing mainly to the large and extensive rush in the neighborhood of Navarre. I estimate that there are now at least 4000 persons on the ground, but as y et there is little known with certainty as to the average yield ; the depth of the sinking, where the best pros pects have been obtained, varies from 10 to 25 feet, the depth of wash-dirt varies from two to six feet, the diggings are running in a westerly direction down the flat, and the holes are increasing in depth, the last that was bottomed being 50 feet. I have to report the locality of a new rush at a place called Fighting Flat, situate one mile and a-half from Redbank, between the Avoca road and the road to McKinnon's, as delineated on enclosed plan for information of the litho grapher. A considerable population are now at work and appear to be making remunerative wages. The ground is patchy, the depth of sinking 50 feet, and the ground is taken up for a distance of about half a mile. The majority of the sluicing companies are still realising good dividends. Avoca Division. (William Byrne, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 With respect to quartz mining, I may mention that the crushing from some of the reefs still continue rich, although the actual quantities crushed are small. One great drawback to the success of this branch of mining in this division of the district may be attributed to the fact, that, a great portion of the most valuable reefs are held by miners who not sufficient capital to develop their resources.

The alluvial sinking in Inglewood has not improved this month, although some of the surfacing has proved remunerative. The quartz reefs at Kingower have not given any signs of improvement this month, the principal workings being on the Union Reef, and in consequence of the quantity of water have suspended operations until they can erect machinery sufficiently powerful to drain the reef (they being in the lowest ground), which, should they accomplish, will enable the whole of the claims to get to work, the shareholders of which are very sanguine. The Old Inglewood Frontage Lead is still being worked with more or less success, 1 oz. to the load, which is being generally obtained, being considered good ground. The rush which took place to Scorer's, situate about four miles south from Inglewood, is now being worked by only six (6) parties, who however seem to have faith in the place. Jericho still holds the even tenor of her way in quartz reefing, and although no enor mous yields are reported, seems to satisfy the shareholders of the different claims, who, with very few exceptions, have been constant to the place for the last two or three years. Several small alluvial rushes have taken place during the month ; one at the Woolshed, Korong, one at Sawpit Gully, Kingower, and another at Red Clay Gully, but they have all turned out very patchy, and are now nearly deserted. Maclntyre's Diggings has been nearly aban doned, and the same may be said of Sinnott's, for I do not think there are more than twenty miners in both places.

Raven, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 A great deal of satisfaction is evinced in this division at the prospect of our long desired re servoir being commenced, and this is the more felt as the near approach of summer gives warning of the usual scarcity of water, some of our best paying works are likely to be stopped if this necessary element be not forthcoming. This satisfaction is greatly increased by the site selected by R. M. Marchant, Esq., iu pre ference to the one previously surveyed, the present one being at a sufficient elevation to supply the town and the machines in the neigh borhood, the old site being sixteen feet too low. The completion of the reservoir and the dis tribution of its water will be an event in the annels of St. Arnaud, from which great results may be anticipated. The speculation would prove successful as far as the sale of water is concerned, and also by removing the hindrance to the successful development of our resources.

Peters still retains a good population, and many of the made hills, which abound in that portion of this division, are now being well tried.

Situate as they are, 14 miles from the nearest crushing machine, too much praise cannot be given them for their perseverance, indeed so energetic have they been, and determined to overcome every difficulty, that they have erected at their camp a crushing machine of quite a new construction, the tailings from which will stand comparison with the best machine in the country, the simple nature of the machine, and the almost total absence of Occupation. a es 9 =- z 3 9 a 3 ag \u20223.3 Sit EHst Alluvial miners 2,380 180* 2,560 Quartz miners 640f ... 640 Other population 4,000*, ... 4,000 7,020 180 j 7,200 Totals c 9 i*-- \u25a0c % s s st p.

I have the honor to report that mining opera tions generally have been exceedingly dull during the past month, attributable to the exodus to New Zealand. As the miners are now returning, with abated energy and empty pockets, the division is gradually \" suffering a recovery,\" brightened only in its gold-producing prospects by the steady and remunerative yield of its quartz reefs. Many of those who, in their eagerness to reach the new El Dorado, sacrificed payable claims, now find a difficulty in selecting equally remunerative sites for working, and sorely repent their precipitant exit. In quartz mining I have again to note a continuance of success as the mines become developed. sence of pyrites and galena has always been considered the best indications of gold-bearing stone, the three being frequently associated together ; but the small quantity of the baser metals near the surface did not attract much attention, but as the reefs are being worked in depth the quantity of pyrites increases and contain considerable gold. The attention of miners is therefore directed to devising some easy process for separating the two, as from present appearances the yield is likely to be an important item in our yields. Fryer's Creek Division. (R. L. M. Kitto, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 \u25a0 The Bolivia Reef presents a more animated appearance than other reefs in the division, the two companies of lessees and private claim holders holding and disputing every inch of ground, and exerting their utmost to work or find the rich lode being wrought by the Ajax Company, who have realised for the past month 935 oz. 10 dwt. frum 299 tons of stone, exclusive of several ounces of gold in pyrites, and a number of valuable specimens sent to Melbourne. The Nuggety Reef continues, as per returns. to pay handsomely, with every prospect of improvement as the working proceeds. Claims in continuation have been taken up, but as yet without striking gold. On the Eureka Reef, Trembath and Company and Harris and Company have found payable quartz at a depth of 220 feet Their success has stimulated miners to accept terms offered by the Ph\u0153nix Company, who have now twelve tributers at work upon their lease. The Old Specimen Gully mine is likely to be worked on tribute, many of the old miners having great faith in its remunerative character. Remarks. \u2014 The Chinese interpreter informs me that 2,500 people are congregated at the large camp at Guildford. About 600 Chinese are at Pickpocket. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Capper's Reef Company is at last to be wound up, the directory having disposed of the whole plant, &c. The machinery is to be removed from the district, and the lease aban doned. The Fortuna, for a short time yielding well, is now suffering decline, and will probably share the fate of its sister (Capper), being under the same management. The Wattle Gully lease is still occupied by miners, who are anxious to obtain a better tenure, so soon as the lease shall be declared forfeited, the ground being capable of affording profitable employment to a good number of men. Of the new reefs reported in my last, the one in Wattle Gully as yet proves the best. Already three claims are yielding rich stone, and two other claims prospects. In connection with quartz mining a new feature is now attracting attention.

Mining generally has been progressing in my division during the past month as favorably as could be expected, considering that the weather has been so very unfavorable to mining operations, as also the depressing influence of rushes to other districts. every instance from the want of adequate capital. It appears that nearly every company was created more on speculation than actually to work the ground. Messrs. McKay, Leith, and Company, who had a grant of 20 acres (the maximum area allowed by the Castlemaine bye-laws), have sold various portions of their grant to parties of Chinese, at prices ranging (as the Chinese in form me) from \u00a31,100 to \u00a3650 for areas of about 2 J acres each; the abandoned portions are being taken up and briskly worked by Chinese. In alluvial mining the puddling interest is as strong in this division as it has been for the year, and should we have a run of dry weather a great impetus will be given to this branch of mining, although there is no doubt but it must soon begin to show signs of falling off unless sortie new ground is discovered in the vicinity. There are large areas containing gold in small quantities which will be gradually puddled as the rate of wages becomes lower. For very many years considerable quantities of gold will be extracted by puddling and sluicing from ground that is now considered worthless. Cement mining is a large interest in this division, especially around Kangaroo and Vaughan. No less than five steam engines, having an aggregate of 92 horse-power, are engaged in crushing cement in these localities. The proprietors are perfectly satisfied with the returns. Two machines are actually crushing the refuse from Kangaroo Creek and are making from \u00a36 to \u00a38 per week per man. At Pickpocket all the companies exception arc at a standstill, and I believe in Quartz mining although in a very dull state is showing some small signs of improvement. The Adelaide Reef, of which I spoke in my report for the month of August, is turning out a little gold and shows signs of improvement, as will be seen by the tabular statement attached, 10 tons yielded 1 oz. 6 dwt. to the ton. This reef is situated at the head of Sebastopol Gully, being nearly midway betwixt Fryers town and Daylesford. There are scores of reefs in the vicinity, which are evidently con nections betwixt the Castlemaine and Dayles ford reefs, and are unquestionably auriferous at greater or lesser depths.

I have applied at several, but although the par ties have no objection to furnish me with returns as to crushings from their own claims, still they were not disposed to give any infor mation as to quartz crushed for hire, without the consent of the respective parties, and I have therefore obtained no information. I have delayed sending this report, expecting to get the Yandoit returns, but it has not been possible to obtain them in time. I shall visit Yandoit tomorrow, and shall at once transmit any information I may receive, and also, if I should succeed, any information received from the Daylesford machines. Hepburn Division. (Ambrose Johnson, Mining Surveyor ) The population is as follows : \u2014 Quartz Mining. \u2014 This branch of mining continues steadily improving, and matters have, during last month, been satisfactory in every sense. A number of reefs, of the pay able character of which very little doubt can be entertained, are still lying idle; but confi dence in quartz mining operations is steadUy gaining ground, and the number of such unworked reefs will proportionally decrease. Strictly speaking, no new reefs have been opened during the last month, but several prospecting claims have been taken up on reefs where, in years bygone, prospects that now would be called very encouraging were obtained. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Of the principal reefs working on Jim Crow I may mention \u2014 \u25a0 Wombat Reef, Wombat Hill.\u2014 The Cornish party have, during the month, been crushing and raising quartz yielding the usual average. The Havelock Company adjoining, north, are busily erecting their machine, and expect in the course of a fortnight to start crushing. The company have got about 200 tons ready for crushing, which is expected to yield upwards of \\ oz. per ton. Most of the quartz has been taken from a depth of about 30 feet, where the reef averages about 5 feet in thick ness. The next claim north, held by Grenfell and Company, is registered, and at a standstill.

Sampson and Com pany's last crushings averaged about 3 oz. per ton, but the water was becoming too heavy, even for a whim to work to advantage, and the claim has since then been registered, while the company are making arrangements for the erection of machinery. and a share fetched \u00a3150 during the latter part of the month. Messrs. Simpson and Company, adjoining, north, have discovered a very pro mising leader on the surface, and a number of claims northward have been taken up in consequence. On Sportsman's Reef, a southern continua tion of same reef, Messrs. Blythman and Com pany are busily erecting their machinery, and will probably, in the course of November, com mence crushing. Messrs. Brown and Company are driving in a tunnel to strike the reef at a considerable depth, and have, I believe, temporarily sus pended working on the reef. On the Beehive Reef, in the same locality, matters look prosperous as usual, but no crushing has taken place during October. The Dreadnought Company have let the contract of driving their tunnel at \u00a31 per foot for a certain distance, the distance yet required to be driven being about 500 feet. In Yandoit nothing of interest has taken place in quartz mining during October. The adjoining claim, held by the Fear nought Company, is situate in Camp street. and has, since the reef was struck, been con tinually disputed. Even now a case is pend ing in the Court of Mines The reef, as far as yet proved in this claim, varies from 2 to 5 feet in width, and has yielded as much as 5 oz. per ton in several large crushings. On Glamorganshire Reef three claims that have struck gold are raising very good stone, but the rest are sinking in search of the lode. Hamburgh Reef. \u2014 The Hamburgh Reef Company applied for a lease of their ground, the original Prospecting Claim and No. 2 South are making preparations for erecting machinery on the ground. On Adams' New Reef, head of German Gully, claim No 4 South is reported to have struck gold at a depth of about 110 feet, the reef averaging 2 feet in width, yielding about 8 oz. per ton Claims Nos. 2 and 3 South are, as usual, producing splendid stone, and on the whole of the reef, the greatest activity is manifest. Messrs. Case and Company, north, are raising stone considered very payable, but the rest of the claims, with the exception of one in the flat, between Hamburgh and Glamorgan shire reefs, are at a standstill, either registered or abandoned. Pioneer Reef. \u2014 The Pioneer Quartz Mining Company have started their engine, which is expected to work admirably. The company have a large quantity of stone ready for crushing, and the whole in the best working order. From Adelaide Reef, head of Don't-wake'm Gully, no crushing has taken place during the month. Claim No. 1 is reported to have fallen off in yield, and the owners are about sinking a shaft to prospect the reef at a depth. Claims No 2, 3, and 4 South are raising payable stone. and Nos. 5 and 6, having been sunk a consider able depth without striking payable stone, are registered. Claims Nos. 3 and 5 South have ama'ga mated, and applied for a lease under the style of \" The Spring Vale Company.\" Claim No. 2 North is registered, and with the exception of claims No. 4 and 5 North the whole of the reef is at a standstill. The Perseverance Company, in the bed of Sailors' Creek, Tippcrary Point, I am informed, have commenced to clean out their workings that were swamped during the flood in July ; and the Nuggety Reef Company, on Nuggety Reef, Connell's Gully, having attained a depth of about 130 feet, where the reef averages from 2 to 5 feet in width, yielding about \u00a3 oz. per ton, have registered, the amount of water to be contended with rendering an engine on the ground necessary. Puddling and sluicing have during October, remained much the same as usual ; the water supply has been amply sufficient, and although in these branches of mining heavy finds are of very rare occurrence, still, on the whole, I believe I may with safety assert that more contentment and comfort will be found in the mining population of the Hepburn Division than most other places. The average yield I estimate at about \u00a33 a man per week, some parties of course doing much better ; but were the yield even less, parties following these avocations are generally settled in substantial houses, with gardens. &c. in a spot convenient their claims, and prefer, gen- rally speaking, to The Prince Llewellyn Company, at the head of dry diggings on Parker's Specimen Reef. have now got fairly to work, and their crush ing machine started, but I have not been able to learn the result of their crushing.

The principal localities for puddling during last season were Chinaman's Flat, Blind Creek, and surrounding gullies, commanded by water races, and generally where running water was easily obtainable, near Spring Creek, Sailor's Creek, &c. ; but this season puddling machines are gradually making their appearance in the western portion of the division. \u2014 such as Old Tom, Champagne, Brandy Hot, 13reak-of-l>ay, and adjacent gullies, and capacious store dams erected, so as to retain a supply of water for the summer; and, as far as I can learn, no great difficulty is exp-rienced in obtaining stuff in these gullies that will average from J dwt. per load and upwards, besides the chance of a nugget occasionally. The rest of the plains to the north-westward is taken up. and tunnels are busily being driven in. In the rest of the division matters remain almost unchanged. On Italian Hill, Wombat Creek, a number of parties aie at work, principally in old ground, and on the whole doing tolerably. Two tunnels, Messrs. Ceres and Company and Bisi and Company, have started tunnels at a lower level than any as yet driven, with a view of working the continuation of the gutter in Francesco Ceres's lease blocks . the distance to be driven expected to be upwards of 1400 feet. In the northern portion of the hill an old tunnel has been taken up for the purpose of working a quartz reef, said to have been cut in driving the tunnel for an alluvial gutter some three or four years ago ; a trial crushing from which reef is reported to have yielded about oz per ton. Sluicing does not this season employ so large a number of miners as foimerly ; the principal reason for which is, that the beds of our creeks and adjoining low banks are nearly worked out, and to cut races now suffi ciently high to work the high ground would be too expensive iu proportion to the length of the time such races would be likely to supply the claims. The principal more extensive races already cut, command water-rights out of the creeks, according to their date of con struction, and races cut now would therefore, in all probability, hardly be able to obtain water for more than two or three months during the season. Several of these races, already cut, have attained a considerable height above the creeks, and might, perhaps. be profitably extended to localities where hitherto sluicing has been an impossibility; but to carry these races for any distance would. owing to the broken nature of the ground, ii n 1 consequent frequent crossing of deep gul lies and cre.ks, in some cases more than 200 feet beneath the height of race attained, be a work of more than ordinary magnitude, and generally too expensive to be undertaken by private enterprise. Stony Creek Ridge, and the made hills about Sailors' Creek, are considered worked out, and are almost entirely abandoned, the few parties at work not making much above a living. On Deep Creek, Fiery Hill is now nearly completely gutted out, and a great portion of the old workings have settled down from the surface. In Sebastopol Hill most of the old workings have shared the same fate, but north wards Messrs. Rossie and Company and the Ballaarat Companies' tunnels are fast ap proaching the gutter, and wi'l probably break through in the course of a few months. These tunnels have been driven about 2300 or 2500 feet in sandstone and slate reefs, and it will require a considerable time even with a good gutter to refund the amount of capital and labor advanced. In Boots, Bald Hill, and along Bald Hill Creek, a few parties are at work, but with the exception of a small nugget occasionally, I do not believe anything worth mentioning is being made. In tunnelling the principal news during the last month come to my knowledge is the breaking through to reef of Messrs. Hart and Company, and Respini and Company, on the Elevated Plains, immediately north of Sir. Meggett's private property. Along Jim Crow Creek, from Shepherd's Flat to Yandoit, nearly all ground is occupied, and the few tunnels broken through are doing very fair, -J to 1 ounce per load by a good height of wash-dirt being about the average. Some time ago Monighetti and Company's tunnel, in said private property, discovered a gutter some thirty feet above the level of their tunnel, from which gutter magnificent pros pects were obtained. This gutter was generally supposed to be a distinct one from any hitherto worked in the plains, and four tunnels imme diately started for this new so-called \" back gutter.\" Of these the two mentioned have In Yandoit the greater portion of the Green or Bald Hills are taken up for tunnelling pur poses, and in three or four of them parties are being exceedingly well remunerated. In Yan doit Hill belonging to the same chain of hills, the Manchester Company has now for more"], [481, "MINING SUEVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 OCTOBEE. 455 than a year been prospecting for the gutter. and expect iu the course of a month to begin reaping the reward for their perseverance. In King William's Gully the New Extended Company, and adjoining extended claims have lately experienced a deal of difficulty through the continual wet weather, and the mining plant of the Extended Company has been ad vertised for sale. In Glengower one or two tunnels are doing first rate, and a large area of new ground is bving prospected, although in my opinion the ground has been taken up more for the purpose of shepherding than with a bona fide intention of working it. The Grand Junction Company on Yandoit Plains, are prospecting their ground and are reported to have struck a lead on the reef even better than the prospect in the deep ground. In alluvial sinking nothing of importance has occurred during October, although this branch of mining h is lately produced a con siderably larger amount of gold than usual. In the western part of Jim Crow, between Sailors' and Deep Creek, patches of very remu nerative ground have every now and again been discovered during the last year, the last of which has been Whiskey Lead near Cham pagne Gully. The Alpha Company's claim has again been taken up by Messrs. Brewer and Company, who intend creeling machinery on the same. Taradale Division. (Thomas Turner, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The ground opened is of no considerable extent, but upwards of two hundred miners have during the last month been profitably employed, 3 or 4 ozs to the tub having now and again been obtained, and I have very little doubt but that this will lead to a thorough prospecting of a numb r of very promising looking gullies in that locality. In the old gullies in the vicinity very litt'e is doing, unless a stray nugget is turned up ; the only instance I have heard of during the month being the find of a 29 oz. nugget by Arbuckle and Company in Billy the Drummer's Flat, near Adams' Reef. In Daylesford the Township Lead is nearly worked, and between Doctor's Gully and Vincent street, and a good few of the claims are abandoned. Remarks. \u2014 The division is 30 by 40 miles in extent, embracing the towns of Woodend, Carlsruhe, Kyneton, Malmsbury, Taradale, and Elphinstone. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 In Kirwan's Paddock, between Duke and Camp streets, the Emerald Gold Mining Com pany have lately bottomed closo to the gutter, and are sinking deeper, so as to be able to drive through the reef at a proper depth. The next claim is the Wombat Hill Gold Mining Company, in the Camp Reserve, who are preparing to erect machinery, ihe water being too heavy for ordinary appliances Then follows Spence and Company working from a tunnel put in from Stanbridge street, and Messrs. Salmon and Company, who have not yet attained the gutter, all of which companies have in my opinion a decidedly good prospect. In Yandoit the only place where new ground is being profitably worked is Shicer's Gully, where some three or four extended claims, con taining one acre each, are paying handsomely ; but the rest of the old gullies are not paying more than a living, in fact only very few parties are working. f2 Occupation. c Z a a, o z a a a _c 5 a _ - a 3 3 3 Is .lluvial miners 400 100 500 [uartz miners 120 120 ithcr population 7,000 7,000 Totals 7,520 100 \\ 7,620 Description.

The following information has been obtained relative to the quantity of Quartz crushed during the month, and the Gold obtained therefrom : \u2014 There has been an increase in the mining population since my last report I estimate there are about 200 miners in the vicinity of Malmsbury ; 200 around Taradale, and along the Coliban River to the northwards ; 100 about the Barfold Ranges, and the Campaspe River ; and 20 at Clowes' Forest, besides about 100 Chinese, most of whom are along the Back Creek. There was, early in the month, a rush of Chinese to Piper's Creek, eastward of Mr. Mitchell's station, but they are now continually leaving that quarter. The Malmsbury field is at present the chief scene of mining operations; about 150 men are there engaged in alluvial workings, in the immediate vicinity of the Coliban reef; but only two claims are being wrought at on the reef. The prospectors' claim is yielding good quartz, averaging 3 oz. of gold per ton. Gold has been struck in the adjoining claim north wards. Many claims are still held, but opera tions are temporarily relinquished. In the early part of the month there were probably 300 miners at this spot, but many of them have retired.

This machine being only of six horse-power, was probably too small for quartz crushing, and the quartz at the Belltopper seeming to be too poor to be worth carting to a distance, the consequence is, the stoppage of mining for a time. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 \u25a0 Around Taradale operations generally pre sent a very dull aspect. However, two tunnels at Yankee Point and one at Scorpion Hill, are yielding well ; and there are isolated cases of good success in alluvial workings within the precincts of the township of Taradale.

Chodat and Company have nearly com pleted a water mill to crush quartz, situate on the Coliban river in this field ; and they intend taking up some abandoned reefs in the vicinity, being fully sanguine of a profitable return. I have the honor to report that the rush to Nuggety Flat still continues; the population now is about 1000,* being double that of last month. There have been no rich finds ; the yields vary from 2 dwt. to 2 oz. to the load, and the wash-dirt 2 inches to 2 feet 6 inches. Payable gold has been discovered by prospect ing parties on the east of the present diggings, and all the gullies are being taken up for dams for securing water for the coming summer. The diggings near Newstead, mentioned in my report some months ago, are steadily im proving ; the lead is extending westward, and is now within half a mile of the township.

(James Murphy, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 which very plainly indicates that the yield of gold from alluvial mining is so small and so precarious that the miners cannot procure the necessaries of life by it. This remark applies to the Caledonia gold field, and especially to that portion of it in the immediate vicinity of Queenstown, which is now all but deserted by the alluvial miners, both European and Chinese. The alluvial ground in the vicinity of Queenstown has been worked out by the Europeans, and for the greater part re-Worked by the Chinese miners, who have given it up as no good; and when the indefatigable activity and keenness of the Chinese miners fail to extract gold from alluvium, it will be in vain that others shall attempt it. As regards the Caledonia gold field gene rally, such a state of alluvial mining as I have described could not endure very long, were it not that the miners are so poor that few of them can risk a day's time and rations in pro specting amongst the hundreds of likely gullies and flats, as yet untried, tlmt are to be met with in every direction on the gold fields of this division. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 By referring again to the foregoing tables, it will be seen that a slight increase has occurred in the number of quartz miners during the past month ; and I have no doubt that, owing to alluvial mining being generally so unremunerative, from the want of new and payable ground being opened up, the increase in the number of quartz miners would be very considerable, if those who would turn their attention to quartz mining had the means of purchasing the necessary appliances and of supporting themselves until their labor applied in this way would yield a return. On the Anderson's Creek gold field, I am happy to be able to state that quartz mining seems to be reviving again as several claims have been recently taken up on the quartz reefs in that locality. This is due to Messrs. Hewitt and Company, who have lately pur chased the calcining apparatus of Mr. Wil kinson, and added to it a very compact and efficient crushing machine of six stamps, with the best appliances I have seen yet for amal gamating and saving the gold. This I have no doubt will give considerable impetus to the progress of quartz mining at Anderson's Creek, it being utterly useless for the miners to raise quartz heretofore, there being no means of extracting the gold, and from the want of efficient crushing and amalgamating machinery, was not only a drawback to, but put a stop totally to quartz mining for a considerable time, notwithstanding the number of auriferous quartz veins in that locality.

A large quantity of quartz is on the surface ready for crushing as soon as some small lots belonging to other claims on ( Ine-tree Hill are disposed of at the quartz mill. by the Yarra Yarra Mining Company. It is said that 36 oz of gold were taken out by one of these parties, in a week, from ground which by either over management or mismanagement yielded nothing to the company. Other claims in the Yarra have been applied for, and it is highly probable that during the coming summer, workings to a very great extent will be profitably carried on, not by (own-made companies, but by co-operative parties of miners, who in general manage their affairs in such cases much better than large companies. The population of the Britannia gold field is now reduced to about thirty, and mining affairs there are rather dull at present.

Notwithstanding the withdrawal of two applications for leases, and the suspension of operations by two or three large parties recently occupying claims on the main lead near Beau fort, the handsome returns recently realised by the parties employing machinery on the various affluents, the improved yields obtained by sluicing, tunnelling, and puddling companies, and the fair prospects recently shown by parties engaged in the development of leads which had been lost and abandoned at least two years since, have fully restored the somewhat waver ing confidence of the mining and commercial classes in the extent and durability of the mineral resources of the division, and caused the sleeping and working shares offered for sale a few weeks ago to be withdrawn from the market. (John Usher, jun., Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows Whilst the improved character of the dwelling-houses lately erected by the mining community in and around Beaufort sufficiently indicate to the most casual observer the settled character of the European mining population; on the other hand the marked decrease in the Chinese mining population, owing to their inability to pay the taxes imposed on them, and the penurious mode of living and wretched dwellings of at least one-half of the remaining Chinese, plainly show that in spite of their great patience, endurance, perseverance, economy, and co-operation, they are utterly unable as a class to compete with the European miner here, whenever his operations are con ducted on the scientific principles of amal gamating labor and capital, and the consequent employment of efficient machinery. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The remoter causes of this exodus of Chinese have been ; \u2014 That Jock's Lead and its tributaries, and the central part of the main lead, have been already re-worked and exhausted by their own countrymen : Total value of all mining plant in the division, \u00a317,350.

That the whole of the surface water right in the division, whether at Raglan, Yam Holes, or Waterloo (available for mining purposes) is in the hands of European capitalists who of course require a weekly rent as an equivalent for the water supply: employed at these places seems to indicate that they are mere patches. At Southern Cross Lead, No. 7 claim has been recently abandoned by its former pro prietors (the White Star Company), who only realised \u00a3300 for seven months' labor. This claim has been re-occupied by another party, who have commenced sinking a new shaft on it during the past week. No. 5 claim is occu pied by Gerrard and party, formerly the owners of No. 1. They have not yet succeeded in finding gold in payable quantity. In No. 4 claim the shaft has been recently lost, and a new one (the seventh on the claim) is now being sunk. The yield of gold for the last nine days' work from the old shaft was 9 oz. That no larger area of old ground than 360 feet is allowed by the new bye-law of the division to parties of Chinese puddlers (generally consisting of six or eight men) than to Europeans who work in parties of three : The great improbability of the discovery of any large area of intermediate sinking which could be worked without steam power in the division : No. 3 claim is paying the shareholders very well, they divided 47 oz. during the last four weeks. No. 2 is being blocked out and is yielding the handsome dividend of \u00a36 per man weekly. From No. 1 the total yield was 170 oz. and not 140, as stated in a former report. And the total want of energy and capital on their part to procure the requisite ma- chinery at Fiery Creek, Yam Holes, or Waterloo, to follow any of the deep leads now in work, or to develop new or dormant leads. All combine gradually to render the Raglan gold fields more and more unfit for profitable occupation by Chinese miners, and many of them have already relinquished the pursuit and betaken themselves to horticultural and other pursuits ; and numbers more would do so if they could rely on a market. The Southern Cross prospect claim has only yielded 54 oz. during the month, owing to one of the drives having been carried 30 feet off the lead. The Royal Saxon claim has given an average yield of 32\u00a3 oz. weekly, the old shaft has col lapsed, and the shareholders are actively en gaged in sinking a new one, more to the west ward, on which they intend to ei ect a 16 horse power engine. With the gradual development of the leads at Paddy's, Carpenter's, and Wingfield's Gullies, affluents of Waterloo, the wide field for miniug operations now open to the speculator at Water loo Flat can scarcely remain much longer un occupied. The claim, formerly in possession of the Prince of Wales Company, is now occupied by a party called the Homeward Bound Company, who are making active preparations for the erection of a 16 horse-power engine. And should the great perseverance exhibited by the Allandale, Fiery Creek, Marco Polo, and Flying Buck Companies result in proving the remunerative character ot' the main lead at the Yam Holes, the Raglan gold fields will shortly attract large numbers of the better class of alluvial miners from the neighboring parts of Ballaarat district. At the Yam or Cemetery Hill, Holdsworth's tunnelling party are still getting a fair return, a few tub and cradle men are also profitably employed on the S. E. side of the burial ground, on the N. E. slope of the hill, where a little gully runs down towards Jock's Creek. At Bolton's or Wire-fence Gully, the little lead discovered some three months since is nearly worked out, and the population limited to the owners of a few claims at the shallow end. The Fiery Creek Steam Sluicing Company have, made weeklv dividends averaging \u00a34 per man, a dividend that would have been larger had they not been occupied a whole week in removing their boxes from the precincts of the area recently surveyed for a cemetery reserve. which they were told by the warden they had encroached on. At Sailors' Gully, which for many months has been tenanted solely by the proprietors of two puddling machines, an extended claim has been recently granted to the discoverers of the lost lead: the depth of sinking is 30 feet, and the yield 4 dwt. to the load, with a great depth of wash-dirt. Patterson's Gully and Malakhoff Hill are yielding a good return to two parties of pud dlers. At Dry Bread and at Shepherds' Gullies, gold in payable quantity has been recently obtained ; but the small number of miners On Jock's Flat, the White Star claim, which was swamped out last month, is again in full work, and yielding good dividends. 82"], [490, "464 MINING SUEVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 .OCTOBEE. The Shamrock and Thistle Company have broken through the reef into payable wash dirt, and are erecting their sluice boxes. The Better-Late-than-Never Company and the Chinese Whim Claim Company have also done very well during the month. A party of puddlers, who have erected a machine near the head of this lead, where the ground was formerly very rich, are getting but poor returns. The Champion of the Seas claim is producing an average yield of 9\u00a3 oz. per week. On the Garibaldi, or Lower Jock's Lead, the prospect claim has yielded an average of 22J oz. per week, during the month. On Charcoal Gully the Whim Company's claim continues to yield favorable returns No. 1, the Royal Standard Company's claim, has recently yielded 33 oz. in one week. On central portion of the main lead from Charcoal Gully to Tipperary, the only occu pants are four parties working with windlass, and the owners of four whim claims near the junction of Wingfield's, and just above Scan dinavian Gully: all Chinese, and just making wages. No. 2, the Olive Branch Company's claim has produced wash-dirt varying in its yield from 3J oz. to 7^ oz. per machineful of ten loads. Ding-dong, or Cornish Lead, is occupied solely by the prospecting party, who are still getting very handsome returns. On Tipperary Gully four parties of puddlers are making good returns. McCooke's Lead is paying the owners of the prospect claim very handsomely, but the party working No. 2 claim are getting but poorly paid for their labor. At Old Jonathan's Gully, \"the Wimmera Sluicing Company are carrying on extensive operations, and state that that their weekly earnings are averaging \u00a384, or \u00a312 per man. At the German Hill, the Cockatoo Steam Sluicing Company, and one party of puddlers, are getting a fair return for their outlay. On the Upper Main Lead, commencing at the junction of Flnche's Gully, I find three parties of Europeans makiug a good return by working three puddling machines. On the Lower Main Lead the claims to the east of the Allandale are all lying idle. At Red Point the ground is occupied by Chinese puddlers . The Allandale Company arc engaged in sinking anew shaft near the supposed j unction of the Main and Garibaldi Leads, aud have already reached the depth of 70 feet. Lower Golden Point is occupied by two parties of Chinese puddlers, and by the Danc ing Feather Sluicing Company, who, however, seem to be nearly worked out. The claim recently held by the Golden Age Company (Wlialley and Company), is lying idle. At Upper Golden Point, also known as the junction of Moggeridge's or Ballaarat Gully, the Ph\u0153nix Company are puddling in the gully, and two parties of Chinese are engaged in puddling, and Kewlej\"- and Company in sluicing on the point; all the above parties rent their water from the Ph\u0153nix Company's race. In addition to these there is one party of puddlers at work on the point, who supply themselves with water from their own dam. The Fiery Creek Company have driven several hundred feet without reaching the gut ter, or rinding payable gold. 'The Marco Polo Company have at last reached the main gutter at a depth of 96 feet from the surface, and obtained a fair prospect, they will wash a machineful in a few days. The Flying Buck Company have just reached the gutter at a depth of 93 feet, and state that they washed J oz. of gold from a track full of dirt. Above this point the Upper Main Lead em ploys and supports the proprietors of seven puddling machines, six parties of Europeans, and one of Chinese ; four of these rent their water from the Ph\u0153nix, and two from the Wimmera Company's races the other party have a dam of their own The whole of the parties employed on this portion of the lead, both sluicers and puddlers, are making good returns and form the most settled portion of the population in the division. The Raglan Company's claim has varied in its yields from 5 to 13 oz., I believe the weekly dividends are about \u00a32 15s. per man. The Whim Claim, just above the Raglan Company, has yielded a fair prospect, it is owned by Chinese. On the Argyle Lead, the Royal Uak Com pany are again making hand-ome dividends.

At Surface Point, the West of Eng land Sluicing Company find advantageous and permanent employment, as they hold the water right in their own hands, and have no neigh bors but one party of Chinese puddlers, who use their tail-water on sufferance. On Fiery Creek side of the range, at Ken nedy's Gully, one party of European puddlers are at work, and supply themselves with water from their own dam. At Long Gully, two parties of Europeans and one of Chinese are engaged in puddling operations ; they derive their water from the Ph\u0153nix race, and are making good returns. At New Jonathan's Gully, the prospect claim has been jumped, and the new occupants are sinking a new shaft. At Madman's Gully, situate between Long Gully and King Charlie's, a prospecting claim has been granted to Murphy and mate. Pros pect, 9 dwt. from bottom of shaft ; sinking, 25 feet. At Carpenter's Gully an extended claim has been granted to a party of eight Europeans for the discovery of a lost lead : the claim is pay ing them good wages. On Waterloo Creek, the Charlton diggings continue their usual yield, and an extended claim was recently granted to Warner and party for the discovery of a lost lead. At Wingfield's Gully, the Great Extended Company have recently reached the auriferous gutter at a depth of 1 35 feet from the surface ; the prospect obtained from the gutter dirt was 3 dwt. to the tub, and 1 dwt. to the tub was obtained on the reef 40 feet distant from the gutter. The company have just completed the erection of their puddling machine, and will be in full work next month.

Since the date of my last report the only items of intelligence I have to communicate are the facts of the Albion Company. French man's Lead, having discovered the gutter; and the New Great Eastern Company a new tribu tary, falling into the main gutter in their claim from the north-east. The Albion Company have been over five years prosecuting then labors in search of the object they have at last succeeded in finding, and from the prospect obtained from the portion of wash-dirt they have tested there is good reason to suppose they will reap a rich harvest for some number of years to come. The success of this company, after so many years' toil, anxiety, and outlay of capital, argues well in favor of the old adage, \" patience and perseverance overcome great difficulties ;\" and once the difficulties of sinking and driving in search of the gutter is mastered. there are few instances where the deep leads of Ballaarat have not proved very remunerative. quently the three companies mentioned in my report of last month, viz., Koh-i-noor, Great Extended, and Band of Hope Companies still continue involved in law. Sago Hill. \u2014 Operations still continue in this locality with about the ordinary amount of success. Quartz Reefs \u2014 The Burra Burra Company have been tolerably successful during the past month; they have raised 1215 tons of quartz, and the total yield has been 278 oz. of gold. No. 3 Division. (Thomas Cowan, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The discovery of the New Great Eastern Company is another proof of the great advan tage companies may derive from extending their operations to the reefs. If the expense of sinking and procuring plant were properly taken into consideration, I think it would go to shew that the operations should not be merely confined to the gutter (particularly in the face of so many instances of very rich deposits being found upon the reefs) but that reefs as well as gutters should be tested thoroughly be fore incurring a like expense in other localities. Regarding the operations of the various com panies engaged in sinking, I have nothing to report further than that under the circumstances peculiar to deep lead sinking on Ballaarat, they are progressing favorably. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Inkermann Lead. \u2014 This lead is being worked by the Allied Armies, Great Republic, Hand in Hand, Royal Saxon, and Southern Cross Companies. The Hand in Hand, Great Re public, and Royal Saxon Companies are receiv ing tolerable remuneration, the average of their dividends being about \u00a310 per week per man. The Allied Armies and Southern Cross Com panies are not so successful ; I may remark, however, that the former have been in the receipt of good dividends during the past three years, and the fact of the falling off is owing to their claim being nearly worked out ; not so with the latter \u2014 a large area of good ground is in their possession, and if they would turn to work with energy, there is no doubt but they would soon be in receipt of good returns.

No. 4 Division. (Michael O'Malley, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows: \u2014 At the present time a great deal of attention is being given to the more thorough prospecting of quartz lodes. The failures which occurred some time ago have not destroyed confidence in quartz mining, because many of them are known to have been the result of inefficient management or of want of sufficient capital. There is now a desire to test our quartz lodes at great depths, in order to ascertain whether the yield of gold is the same, or whether as some imagine, it will be found greater in pro- portion to the distance from the surface. In alluvial mining I have nothing new to report ; the various old ground companies con- tinue to cany on their operations with about average results. In quartz mining some improvement has taken place, and claims that were at one time almost deserted, are now being worked success- fully. So many of our companies started by the working shareholders had to run deeply into debt for machinery, that their operations were embarassed at the outset, and their failure might have been predicted. The machinery is as follows Many have been reorganised, and are now in a fair way to do well. The run of rich quart/, struck at a deep level in the claim of the Wellingtonia Gigantea Name of Company.

The following information has been obtained relative to the quantity of Quartz crushed during the month, and the Gold obtained therefrom : \u2014 During the last month mining affairs in this division have undergone little or no change, nor has there been any new ground opened. Deep Leads. \u2014 Frenchman's and Whitehorse. \u2014 The gutter (for such it is now proved to be) discovered a few months since by the Defiance Company in the neighborhood of their old workings on Frenchman's Lead, is likely to afford them remunerative employment for some years to come. They have only commenced getting up wash-dirt a few days since, and from the three machines washed up to last Saturday as much as 75 oz. of gold was ob tained, which yield is considered highly satis factory by the shareholders, more especially as there is a good depth of stuff and every facility for taking it out. The Nelson Company have also been getting up some very good stuff of late, though it is generally considered they have not as yet got into the Frenchman's gutter ; the prevailing opinion is that they are working the new gutter above mentioned in the immediate neighbor hood of its junction with Frenchman's. How ever this may be, the company are quite san guine regardingthe paying nature of the ground, and in high hopes of having some three or four years' profitable employment before them. They obtained about 400 oz last week, and now that the litigation in which they have been lately engaged with their neighbors (the Red Jacket Company) is decided in their favor, there is every reason to expect that these per severing men are in a fair way of obtaining handsome returns for upwards of five years' dead labor expended in putting down a shaft through nearly 400 feet of basaltic rnck. The Working Miners' Company, as already reported, got through the heavy drift overlying the bed rock in their shaft about five or six weeks since, but as yet have not succeeded in thoroughly puddling up the shaft through that stratum; they are. however, commencing to sink some 20 feet farther into the reef before opening out for the gutter, which they have reason to believe will be found not far distant. The prospects of this company arc also con sidered very good ; the general opinion is that, in addition to the Frenchman's and the new gutter already referred to, they will have the Grand Trunk or Ballaarat Main Lead in its southward course passing through their claim. should this be so. it is difficult to estimate the value of a share in this company, as there is every reason to expect that the ground about the junction of the combined Frenchman's and W hitehorse Leads, &c, with the Ballaarat Main Lead will be exceedingly rich. At all events, such is very generally expected, and in conse quence shares are anxiously looked after by some of the knowing ones of Ballaarat. The present price is between \u00a3900 and \u00a31000, but difficult to be had even at the higher figure. The Red Jacket Company ( \\Y hitehorse) are working with about average results. 'I his company would have realized fair remuneration were it not for the protracted and expensive litigatiou in which they had been all along engaged, since getting into gold, with the owners of adjoining claims on Frenchman's Lead, with whom they have to divide equally the proceeds of the combined leads, both leads having united or junclioned before reaching the ground of these companies.

They expect now, however, to be able to combat with any water they may encounter, as they have just completed the erection of an excellent 50 horse-power engine, which bales water with an 8-feet stroke through a column of pumps 17J inches in diameter. Shares in this company are beginning to look up ; I believe \u00a3350 is about the present value ; and as soon as work is fairly resumed below, the likelihood is they will advance much higher, as if the future yield of the gutter should continue equal to what it had been pre vious to the swamping out (16 oz. per machine was, I believe, about the average), this com pany will realize very good returns for many years to come. able falling off in the yield us gold here during the month, and affairs brought to a standstill by the intervention of private property, all the available Crown land having been long since occupied.

The population is as follows : \u2014 The promoters of the Pluribus in Unum Company (Fussell and Company), who took up a large claim in May last south of the Scottish and Cornish Company's Claim, have been unsuccessful in forming a large co-ope- rative company to work the ground, and, there- fore, have decided upon amalgamating their claim with that of the Leviathan Company adjoining on the Napoleon Lead, with a view of availing themselves of the plant, shaft, and workings of the latter, from which it is expected a considerable portion of their claim may be worked, as it is considered there will be a junction of both leads somewhere not very distant from the shaft in question. Whim Holes and Little Hard Hills.\u2014 There is nothing new to report of this district, except that the population as well as the amount of gold have been decreasing this time back ; some three or four puddling companies, how- ever, continue to realize tolerable wages, and the Heart-and-Hand Cement Crushing Com- pany to obtain satisfactory returns.

The One-and-All-Company continues to crush about 800 tons per month, averaging for the last month about 4 dwt. per ton. Durham Lead. \u2014 The Pioneer Company has succeeded in breaking through with their in cline drive, and horses will now be employed underground in bringing the wash-dirt from the face to the foot of the tunnel. The returns of this company have been about 210 oz. of gold for the month, being somewhat less than the last month's yield, consequent from many of the men being engaged about the incline drive before spoken of. The Convention Company has been steadily at work realizing about \u00a35 per week per man. The Telegraph Company is still yielding dividends ranging from \u00a312 to \u00a315 per man per fortnight. The All Nations Company, Magpie, has crashed about 400 tons, yielding 4 dwt. per ton. A party of Chinese has recently struck a reef in their claim, south of the Standard Company, which has a very promising appear ance. This party has engaged the cement battery on the Hard Hill, at a rental of \u00a340 per week, with the option of buying it, at a stated price, which iu all probability they purpose doing, since application has been made by them for an extension of their claim, and an area for machinery. The Triune Company, Scandinavian Reef, has crushed about 400 tons of stone, but the average has not been above 2 dwt.. but better stone is now being raised, which it is hoped will prove remunerative The New Perseverance Company, White horse, has only crashed about .300 tons during the month, at an average yield of 3 dwt. Their battery has been idle for the greater part of the month through some necessary alterations connected with the machinci v. The John Bull Company is earning about \u00a35 per week per man. This company has resumed work in the upper portion of their ground, and anticipates by so doing an augmen tation of its dividends. The Great Britain Company during the month has had some very good samples of coarse gold, which leads them to hope that better ground is near at hand. The National Company (late Polar Star Company) has commenced baling and expect to reach the face again in a few days. On the Napoleon Lead no change necessary to report on has taken place.

The prospecting party on the quartz reef near Whybrow's Gully have raised another quantity of stone for a further trial ; the last tiial gave about 18 dwt. the ton. Should the next turn out as well the reef will become at once the scene of active operations, as a great many companies are hesitating until further trial reveals more of the nature of the place. Scarsdale.- This locality looks well. The Washington Company have struck a new lead coming into their old claim from the ranges in the direction of Camgham ; they have obtained a new claim on it. Three other companies have also taken up claims there One of these companies have bottomed on the verge of the deep ground, and another is very far advanced with the shaft. No definite result from the (John Lynch, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Lugar and Undaunted claims at the foot of the Black Hill. 'J he Cr\u0153sus are doing tolerably well 'Ihe Golden Gate still better. The Smythe's and Browne's Junction and Bute are getting excellent dividends. I am informed that the former had 200 oz for the last week, or nearly 10 oz. per man, and the latter something still better. Adjoining the Bute ground, which is on private property, there is a block containing 133 acres belonging to Messrs. Lewis and Perrot which has been lately taken up for mining purposes on terms very advantageous to the proprietors of the land. Next adjoining the southern boundary of this land are the leaseholds of the Scarsdale and Gemini Companies on Crown lands These blocks are 50 acres each in extent. There is but one shaft sinking on or near the common boundary of the blocks. It is likely the companies intend to work all the ground from the one shaft. The shaft is at present nearly 200 feet deep. I am doubtful whether it be on the Main Trunk Lead, as was at first supposed, or on the Oldham Lead, a tributary from the Western Ranges in the neighborhood of the Black Hill, which in all likelihood joins the main lead in the immediate vicinity of the shaft. Between these b'ocks and Browne's pre-emptive right three claims have been taken up lately under the frontage system of lengths respec- tively 1320 feet, 15'25\"feet, and 3645 feet, which brings all the ground up to Browne's fence into occupaiion. Another frontage claim 2640 feet long, has been taken up on the Oldham Lead just referred to. which, brings that lead into occupation up to the boundary ot the Gemini leasehold ; so that all the available ground on the Smythe's and Browne's Main Lead is at present occupied ; a state of things no doubt caused by the encouraging aspectof the J unction and Bute claims. The machinery is as follows : Total value of all mining plant in the division, \u00a3100.000. Number of square miles of alluvial ground which is being or may have been actually worked upon. .30.

The price of go'd during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 18s. to \u00a33 18s. 6d. per oz. There has been no crushing during the month except at the Britannia Reef, Carngham. I have requested ihe information required twice by letter but have got none. I have the honor to transmit you the following report of the state of mining in Division No 6, Mining District of Ballaarat, for the month of November, 1861 : \u2014 Smythesdale \u2014 Very few changes have oc curred here within the month. On Warren's Flat some of the claims have improved ; towards the head of the creek Chinese parties have met with several patches of paying ground. Upon the whole the state of the mines has been satisfactory. Browne's. \u2014 lhe Hand-in-Hand claim has turned out first-rate wash-dirt within the last few days; there is a probability of its making amends for past failure.

The Grand Trunk, and the Try Again, (alluvial) are sinking. The Reliance is not getting more than average wages. The Red Hill and Mines Royal will be worked out in a few months; the ground in both is very poor. The Cleft of the Kock Company have struck a new run of ground so much deeper than any hitherto found that they are unable to work it from the present level of their shaft. They are, however, making very good wages from the shallow end of the ground, and a number of the men are making the necessary arrange ments for proving the deep ground. The Nelson. Wellington, and Springdallah have broken up. On Brown's Flat there are two parties at work on the abandoned ground; as yet they have not had time to ascertain what their chances may be as their machinery had not been completely erected until a few days ago. The Grand junction claim is paying moder ately. On Watson's Hill and the shallow ground around Brown's, the Chinese are making a living in all cases and in some doing remarkably well. Linton. \u2014 Some of the few claims still at work on the Old Standard Lead continue to yield splendid returns. The Time-will-Tell Company, for the last three weeks divided \u00a395 or upwards of \u00a330 per week each man. On the Lancashire Reef there has has been a decided improvement lately, Griffith's party have made \u00a35 per man weekly for a few weeks back. The Britannia, adjoining the above, con tinues to yield from \u00a3 6 to \u00a3 1 0 a man every week. The Success Quartz Company on Mullachy Point Reef, have not had a crashing yet. This is the only remaining company now on that once hopeful reef. The Havelock Claim on Monkey Gully is worked out. It is now about two j-ears since this was commenced and it has given since then nearly \u00a3800 a man. The Falcon and Working Miners Company are not doing much The Prince of Wales, averaging more than wages. The Catch-me-who-Can, on a tributary of the Standard, is improving, and now yields about \u00a35 a man weekly. The Exhibition Company has improved also and gives good wages. The Glamorgan Company have been com pelled to sink an air shaft and have thereby thoroughly ventilated their drives, the want of which has seriously impeded the progress of their works for better than a month. The Monkey Guliy Lead is drawing near a close, and well has it rewarded its occupiers. At Italian Gully the White Star have been getting for several weeks back about \u00a36 a man. The Star of the North, and Emeu, moderate wages, and the Prince of Wales, and All Nations, doing tolerably well. There is a claim on the Cumberland Lead which promises well; with the above exception there is but very little of consequence doing at Italians. The Redan, and Golden Age Companies on the Black Lead, are making steady wages. The Edinburgh Company obtained for the last month 430 oz., or an average of 107^ oz. weekly. This well-known company consists of fifty shareholders, and is worked partly by hired labor and partly by contract, the number employed being about forty. The Duke of Cornwall, adjoining the Edin burgh, after a long and expensive search have struck ground which promises to pay well in future, their average yield being about \u00a34 a man weekly for the last month. Captain Finn's Reef, at Gordon's Gully, has risen considerably in repnte during the last fortnight. They have had the first crashing last week. I have not ascertained precisely what the result was. but from the appearances the sluice boxes presented before washing off, the yield must have been something consider able. On the faith of this trial other claims have been taken up on the same reef. The Atlas weekly yield is between 30 and 40 oz. ; the second puddling machine is nearly erected, and then this company will be enabled \u2022 to dispose of a greater quantity of wash-dirt than they have heretofore been. Springdallah. \u2014 The Springdallah Quartz Mining I'ompany have wound up their affairs. An enormous amount of expenditure has been incurred in connection with this claim, without any corresponding return even in work done. It is the general belief now that a proper trial has not been given to the reef, and that the company have been premature in dissolving. That mismanagement has prevailed to a great extent there can be no doubt, but through whose agency or under what particular cir cumstances does not appear so obvious. The John Bull are now fully at work, and up to the present date have been but poorly remunerated, their usual returns being from 2 to 5 oz. to the machine. They have just lately struck a branch lead which they believe will pay them better. The Pioneer Company, within Linton Park, have been very unlucky; after persevering for months they have considered it advisable to proceed no longer under the old regime, and therefore they agreed to let it to a number of workmen on tribute for three months, after"], [503, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 NOVEMBER. 475 which, should nothing remunerative be struck in the interim, it is probable the company will give up.

The Albion not having struck any paying ground yet are about making terms to let the claim on tribute. The Lucky are going through the rock and are now 160 feet deep. The Don Juan have not yet struck paying ground, they are driving for the Ivanhoe gutter. The Golden Gate Company have bottomed shallow. The Telegraph extremely poor. The Red Lion given up. The Bedfordshire has taken up fresh ground on the supposition that the lead has given a sharp turn out of the old claim. The Magnum Bonum scarcely making wages . The Cairngorm, after a long and expensive trial, have given up.

Value of shares about \u00a3300. The North American have reached what is called the tunnel gutter in the upper end of their ground, but it is so poor that they have discontinued working it ; they are sinking a new shaft near the deep end of their ground, it is now 60 feet in the rock. Creswick Division. (James Stevenson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The British, who have had a long stoppage. have re-commenced, and are now well equipped, they expect to reach the gutter in a very short time The Robin Hood are now 140 feet through rock; the Hibernia are over 60 feet through .rock, and the Bon Accord about the same depth. The Grand Junction bottomed on the reef very shallow ; they have penetrated through the reef to a depth of 170 feet, and are not probably more than one-half the required depth yet. The Eagle Quartz Company have sunk from their former level of 30 feet to 80 feet, and at 6 feet from the shaft have struck the reef 6 feet iu thickness ; they have crushed none from the lower level. The machinery is as follows Carngham \u2014 At Toffee Hill, Snake Valley, 6ome ground which had been partially worked years ago has been re-opened, and eight block claims marked off on it. Serpill and party, Hill and party, and Dixon and party have each struck ground which promises to pay them well, the average produce being about 1 5 dwt. to the load of stuff, and the wash-dirt being very wide and about four feet thick. The depth of sinking does not exceed 40 feet, and the workings are quite dry ; there is no doubt of the ground in question being the shallow end of the Snake Valley Lead, nor of the claims already taken up comprising the whole of the paying\" ground, as the intermediate space between \"the prospecting claim and the next point at which the Snake Valley Lead has been proved is comprised in these claims.

Clunes Mining.\u2014 -Referring to this portion of my district I have to r< cord the completion of the model quartz-crushing battery, by the Port Phillip Company, which is intended for the international exhibition in London next year. Progressively I have referred to this work, which reflects creditably on the skill of the local artisans. It is two-thirds the size of the com pany's 12 head battery: every detail is finished in the most precise manner ; the framework of the machine is of the best procurable box tim ber; the back and front boards are of light wood ; the strikes aud amalgamating barrel are of colonial cedar; the whole has been beautifully polished, and the company's me chanics have very exactly finished the iron work. I am informed that Mr. Knight, the agent for the Victorian Commissioners, has expressed his highest approbation of the manner in which the model has been prepared. On the hill opposite, now called Tunnel Hill, the Prince of Wales Company have taken up ground on which a party had sunk a shaft to a depth of 1 00 feet, without however reach ing the bottom : the present company intend to do so I have no doubt that they will suc ceed in getting gold, as all the diggings at Longpoint run in that direction, and it may eventually be proved to form a junction with the Red Streak Lead.

The You Know Company are 60 feet, and the G olden Gate Company 75 feet deep, and neither are yet through the rock. About quarter of a mile to the south-west of the Werribee Fly Company, Kincaide and party have struck a narrow run of gold; the depth is 20 fed, and the average yield 1 dwt. per bucket. From the Eastern Reef but 3550 tons have been taken out. The northern portion of this mine has been but partially worked ; the stone raised has come from the central portion of Robinson's and the Eastern Reefs There has been an increase of 1659 tons of quartz raised upon the previous six months, and an additional cost on the contracts to work the mine of \u00a31761 7s, and the sum for surface labor of \u00a3274 9s. They are still working on the Welcome Reef, which is hard and flinty, but the stone looks well and paying. They are also working on the Robinson's, Eastern. and Western Reefs. On the Western Reef they are sinking a winze for ventilating the cross-cut on the 38-fathom level, in the south engine shaft, from which drives are being On the Back Creek a patch of very good ground has been struck ; some parties have made during the last two weeks \u00a315 per man, and some have washed as much as an ounce to the tub. The gold, however, cannot be traced for any considerable distance. At Ironstone Hill, and its continuation, Caine's Hill, the several parties working con tinue tn do well.

The northern shaft will shortly be started, to be silnk to the depth of 600 feet. Some delay has been experienced in carrying out this intention, owing to a necessity of keeping the shaft open for the purpose of working out the northern portion of the mine, and to secure the ground. The new engine to work the ground from the northern shaft has been started ; its fitting up has given every satisfaction. 16th, 223 tons, which yielded 124 oz. 1 dwt. 12 gr. ; and to the 23rd November, 97 tons, yield not known, as the company are taking down their old battery, and getting a considerable quantity of gold from under the heads and strikes. They will erect a 24 head iron framed battery as speedily as possible, add another boiler to their crushing engine, and build a brick stack for the same. The whole of the new mining engine is on the claim ; another brick stack will be built for this, and their present 15 horse-power engine kept as an auxiliary for winding The sinking of the shaft is being rapidly proceeded with, and I am warranted in stating, that the expectations of the inhabitants of this place in reference to this mine are of a very favorable character. Criterion Company have been successfully working on the Bobinson's Reef ; they have crushed, from October 26th to the 30th November, 1 1 70 tons of stone, which yielded 912 oz. 3 dwt 10 gr. of gold. These returns have afforded the company of nine shareholders dividends amounting, in the aggregate, to \u00a3220 each. Clunes Alliance Quartz Mining Company have expended the sum of \u00a3 5 1 8 6s. 6d during the month; they employ 31 men. They have made a cross cut from the chamber opened to the east, of 73 feet, when they struck a leader of quartz 18 inches to 2 feet in width. The stone looks to be of a very paying character, but has not been separately tested. From their present operations it is not stated that they have secured a paying lode of quartz, but the prospects are of a very promising character. Robinson's Reef still maintains its character of 30 feet, nearly, in width. Recently about 400 tons of quartz have fallen from the drive, but no damage to the works was done. The old workings are being filled in to secure the mine. Hinck's patent washing and amalga mating machine is being tested by this com pany for the extraction of gold from their quartz tailings. The present application is not intended, in its form, as other than an experi ment ; the result is stated to be about 4 dwt. per ton, from the debris of the company's crushings. If this return is shown by the future operations and trials of this patent, the company purpose to put up a larger machine to work the same. New North Clunes Company are not ready to recommence sinking their shaft, but their preliminary works are rapidly progressing, and the pumping arrangements and the shaft gear are being very well attended to. The Young Sons of Freedom Company (alluvial) have not succeeded in making their stamping machinery, as applied to their wash ing and amalgamating operations, pay ; the works are at present discontinued. Yankee Company, from October 3 1 st to 30th November, have crushed 450 tons ; the average cost of raising the stone and crushing, \u00a3 1 per ton. The present depth of the mine is 300 feet. The width of the two present reefs worked by this company, namely, Robinson's and the \\\\ estern, is respectively 14 and 9 feet each. Gordon Division. The Victoria Quartz Crushing Company. \u2014 \u25a0 Since the last returns furnished me by this company, they state that they have crushed 619 tons of quartz, which yielded 774 oz 3 dwt. in bar gold. Their expenditure for the month has been \u00a33113, namely\u2014 on account of mining works. \u00a31813, and by payment of a mortgage of \u00a31300. (J. B. Cusack, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Welcome Reef, on the No. 2 level. referred to in my last, is 22 feet wide ; on the lower level it continues to be 10 feet in width.

There are a few aliuvial miners trying some gullies, but no results are made known as yet ; most of the gullies in the vicinity of the quartz ranges are known to contain g'dd, but nothing sufficient has been found hitherto to induce extensive development. Mount Egerton. \u2014 The Big Hill Company have been taking out old blocks of quartz, which were standing from former workings, at depths from 50 feet to 80 feet. In the north end of the reef the width reduced to a few inches, and it was supposed it would break up and be lost, but in driving west about 3 feet through clay and sandstone slate they came on a small leader which in tracing north formed a large reef several feet thick, which is no doubt the continuation of the main one.

The other deposit is a gravelly wash some times of several feet thick, this appears a travelled wash in which the gold is ot a lighter and smaller description, and met with in ex tended beds, and filling what appears to have been extensive hollows The alluvial deposits first attracted the attention of miners to this field, but on the discovery of quartz gold veins the alluvial workings were abandoned for what has been considered a more remunerative and permanent source of gold; and certainly so long as the quartz veins yet discovered on Steiglitz could be worked by hand labor above water level no quartz gold field in Victoria as yielded larger returns to individual enterprise. The first may be described as a primary and the other a secondary wash, and the success of our miners depends on their being able to dis tinguish this difference in order to a profitable investment of their labor; there is also this advantage that the primary deposit referred to are found far above water level and altogether unconnected with the other. It has occurred to me that a proper diagram and descriptions might be of great service to alluvial mining generally, and on various parts of this field there are favorable illustrations for representation on paper. The favorable opinion shown by public companies in selecting the Steiglitz quartz veins for the investment of their capital has produced events in our mining history never anticipated. The prospect of constant employ ment on set wages has alike stopped quartz gold and alluvial mining as an industrial pur suit while prospecting new ground has during 18 months been unknown. Quartz Mining. \u2014 The Sailors' Reef Com pany have not been working their ground for some time, but an engineer has been on the ground lately to make a careful examination, &c . previous to commencing the erection of their machinery. They have applied for an extended ai ea of ground, including the ground already leased to them. The unsuccessful manner in which so many of the public gold mining companies here have been conducted, with the entire suspension of operations by not a few of them, have com pelled the working miners still left on Steiglitz to look for some new source of employment. The Perseverance have determined to wind up their affairs; they have expended the whole of their capital, as I have before mentioned in working on a barren vein, and the results are what might have been expected. The alluvial ground, which is shallow sinking, has again attracted attention. Under a most erroneous impression, common to the miners, thatcieeks and banks of rivers are the most likely localities for alluvial gold, the ground hitherto worked on this field for alluvial has been the small flats and level patches of dry and water gullies. The Cosmopolite Company's lease has been gazetted and the lessee intends commencing operations forthwith. The mullock from No. 9. North Boxing Reef, has been crushed at the New Chum Company's mill and has paid well. The successful exertions of the miners on the Moorabool, Tea-tree Creek, Dolly's Creek, Mount Boran. and Stony Rises, all on the slopes of the hills, and table land, has at length with a little persuasion induced the miners on Steiglitz (out of employment) during this month to try the slopes of the hills, much farther from the beds of creeks or dry gullies, and in several instances with success, which if known on more populous fields might soon double our popula tion. One miner assisted by a little boy, in one month collected upwards of \u00a3100 worth of gold; another party has not been much less successful, while with others \u00a31 per day has not been uncommon; but such success is not the result of mere chance, but skilful applica tion of labor. The alluvial deposits consist in what may be I am unable to ascertain the results of the various crushings from the Malakhoff Com pany's claim, there is no reason however to suppose otherwise than that it is still paying them well. The Gibraltar Company have accepted tenders for driving out a 100ft. block of quartz: their ground is now cleared of all the water and no doubt in a few weeks some payable returns may be made to them, and not before they were wanted, as during a long series of delays breakings down and other accidents in volving loss ot time and money, public confi dence was beginning to be shaken in their ultimate success. 0"], [510, "482 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS NOVEMBER. the erection of a 12 horse-power engine for the purpose of pumping from a deep shaft situated in the Tea-tree basin, and then conveying it by a race along and at the mouths of the whole extent of the various tunnels and claims. On Morrison's Diggings also nothing above the average has occurred this month, and the same remarks will apply to 1 lolly's (reek and Stony Rises ; but in the two last cases want of water is very much felt. The Redan Company have not yet erected any machinery on their ground, except remov ing a horse whim to a shaft where they are at present engaged in raising mullock from the old workings; this (the mullock) looks very well and will I believe pay better than the last crushed at an average of 6 dwt. per ton. The New Chum Company have also been busily engaged in crushing mullock, and with results as stated above. This cmpany is also raising mullock which from appearances promises to j'ield very handsome returns. Blackwood Division. (Thomas Hay, Mining Surveyor ) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Morning Star Company are still vigor ously working and prospecting their ground. I believe up to the present time the results of crushing have not realized their expectations, their machinery however now is pretty efficient and with care will in a short time repay them their large outlay. The Wellington Reef Company have large quantities of quartz raised and stacked on their ground; they are at present contending with great difficulties of water ; it is their intention to erect machinery, &c. The Albion Company are as usual doing first rate, the manager informed me that the average returns for the last six weeks were \u00a3400 per week. I have a few days since seen specimens from their deepest ground, which are splendid, the vein is a strong and thick one, and the ground easily worked. The Birmingham Reef prospect claim have crushed a small quantity of quartz lately (20 tons), the result was I5 oz. per ton. Drawings already in preparation will be forwarded next month of (his claim. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The New Year's Reef Prospect Claim obtained an average of 3 oz. per ton from their last crushing, 35 tons. No. 1 South, on same reef, 2 oz. per ton from about 50 tons The lease of the Norfolk Company's ground has been cancelled; applications under miners' rights have been made for portions of it, and the registered applicants are now busily engaged in making roads, &c. &c , for the removal of the many thousands of tons of mullock now lying on the surface, and the raising similar quantities deposited in the oldwoikings; a crashing of this mnllock averaged about 4 dwt. per ton ; this is considered a very handsome return and will pay those now engaged in it most profiably. I refer you to my preliminary remarks as to the state of alluvial mining on Steiglitz \u2014 very satisfactory. On the Tea-tree mining matters have been very dull owing to the great scarcity of water, the washing dirt is equally good to that pre viously obtained, and large quantities are stacked awaiting rain, or water from any other sources.

Nine out of fifteen companies have done nothing in the way of getting and crushing quartz ; some of these are engaged in sinking new shafts and setting up machinery, but the best part of them stop from inability to proceed for want of funds. This is to be regretted, as all these mines may be carried on profitably if skill and capital were at hand. This, unfortunately, is not the case, and I am sorry to say that at present I can see no prospect of their forthcoming, and consequently no hopes of speedy improvement. Sluicing, as I anticipated, has flourished during the month, but now, at the latter end of it, water is beginning to get short, and applica tions for protection registration are ou the increase. Many, however, who have claims in and near the main creek are still doing well and likely so to continue. Although this month has passed without any extraordinary finds of gold, nearly all Ihe sluicers have realized ample remuneration, with, as far as may be judged, good prospects for the future. The formation of the Blackwood gold field is peculiarly favorable for alluvial diggers with limited capital, inasmuch as there is no dee]) sinking required, nor no machinery for lifting water, as there is ample fall for drainage in every part easily and unexpensively procured, so that in fact the only outlay necessary is for sluicing boxes and mining tools ; thus equipped a party with a small capital and a fair share of skill, patience, and perseverance, may realize a competency in a few years. This, however, is not enough to satisfy the excited expectations of the general digger, who, in his enthusiasm, is anxious to jump at fortune without undergoing the pain of labor and patience to obtain it.

Spring Creek, Three-Mile, and Wool- shed Divisions. (Henry Grimes, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Lerderderg Company doing nothing. The Simmons' Reef Quartz Mining Com pany the same. Appleton Brothers have for a time withdrawn from deep workings to near the surface, where they get quartz which years ago was thrown aside as worthless, but which is now found to be of value and to produce a fair profit in being worked up. The Cornish Company who are working on the same principle as the Appleton's, and on the same reef, are unavoidably falling off in amount of work from their crushing apparatus being propelled by a water wheel, and water now growing short. Williams and Company, whose crushing power is derived from a water wheel must necessarily fall off in amount of work at this season of the year from a short supply of water, although their work for the present month has been fair. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Johnson's Reef. \u2014 The Caledonia Company at a dead stand. Trewhella's Reef. \u2014 The Pioneer Company, the principal one on this reef, have done very little during the month. The works are now quite stopped. The Concordia Company quite stopped.

There is a good lot of quartz yet on hand looking very promising, and no doubt will be very productive, as gold is abundantly visible. The Garibaldi Reef lies to the westward of this and runs parallel with it; 25 tons of quartz got fiom this reef have been crushed which yielded 55 oz. of gold.

The proprietors of the above engine have reduced their price of 30s. per ton (which they contracted for previous to the erection of the engine) to 20s.; this will allow a large quantity of quartz to be crushed that would otherwise have been thrown away. I have the honor to report for last month as follows: \u2014 We have had a considerable fall of rain during the month for this time of the year, and which will be of great consequence to the sluicers to carry them through the summer. They are steadily at work, many making good. and the others average wages There are very few other alluvial miners in this division, and their earnings are very precarious. At Myrtleford, Messrs.

The population is at present very unsettled, many are leaving for the Luchlan diggings and it is consequently impossible to give more than an approximate return Gander's Reef is now taken up by a new company, who have succeeded in finding a good reef on the more northern portion of the claim, which had not been much prospected by the original occupiers The reef is about 2 feet wide and easy of access. The Home Reef continues to give good returns, but the yield is not at present so good as formerly. The vein is, however, well defined, and cf an average width of 2 feet. There has lately been a considerable im provement in the Ebenezer Reef, and there is at present every prospect of its continuance ; the reef is well defined, and from 2 to 6 feet in width ; the shaft and levels now being worked are 130 feet in depth. Richardson's Reef has yielded but a small quantity of quartz during the month, a fresh company having now possession of the ground, and not having yet done much work on the claim. The Chinese population continue to increase Although the European population who have hitherto been engaged in alluvial mining are now many of them leaving the district, I have still to report an improvement in that branch of mining, especially on the Upper Buckland. where, during the past month, several new bank claims have been opened, and are yield ing most satisfactory returns ; and generally, all the miners who are in the possession of water rights are making handsome wages. The yield of alluvial gold on the buckland River is now fully equal to that of two years ago. On the Ovens River and Morse's Creek alluvial mining is also prosperous, but these fields are now almost exclusively occupied by the Chinese, and amongst them several in stances of very handsome returns have been observed during the past month. Quartz mining continues steadily prosperous on the majority of the reefs in this division. Prospecting, however, has received a consider able check, in consequence of a'most all of the surplus population having left, and al.-o some of those whose claims were not paying. The only discovery which has lately taken place, is one of a reef of considerable size, situate on the eastern side of the Ovens River, near Mess:s. Mackay and Company's crushing machine. On this two claims have been taken up, and the prospectors have had a small trial crushing of some of the surface stone, 1 ton of which yielded 1 oz. It has been named the Kangaroo Reef. On the Oriental Reef the claims are con tinuing to give a good yield, and the reef con tinues very thick, in some parts from 10 to 17 feet, the whole of which (in the prospectors' claim and No. 1 South), is crushed. Messrs Cotsworth and Wood have now got the whole of their tramway and plant in first rate working order, and their mill, consisting of 32 stamps (half of which are driven by water and half by steam power), is now crush ing nearly all the quartz raised from the Oriental Reef. On the Pioneer Reef a large quantity of stone is being raised, which will probably be crushed during the ensuing month. Messrs Wallace and Company have com pleted their water-power machine, which will soon be at work on the Pioneer quartz. The wheel is sufficiently powerful to drive 24 heavy stampers, but at present only 12 have been erected, in two batteries of 6 heads each. A water-wheel is also in course of erection on Morse's Creek, in connection with the lied Star Beef (formerly named the William Tell). The prospectors on this vein are a party of working shareholders, who have been most perseveringly working for a long time, and are likely to get well paid now should the quartz turn out as well as its appearance would indi cate ; and the advantage of a cheap crushing power will enable them to clear their expenses out of very poor stone, and as the reef is also conveniently situate. Messrs. Holstein and Company are also erecting a powerful water-wheel, to crush for Brenkmann's Reef, which is continuing to yield very good quartz in large quantities. Faulkner's Keef (Ovens River) still con tinues one of the best in the district, and has at present every prospect of permanence. It is probable that the entire length of their claim ( 1 60 yards) will prove equally good. No. 1 North, on this rets is still being pros pected, but no reef has yet been struck. The Hampton Reef prospecting claim con tinues to yield good quartz, of which a small quantity has been crushed, and more is now being carted to the mill. On the Buckland 1-iiver, Messrs. Tracy and Company have been raising quartz from the Nelson Reef, but none has been crushed during the month. No. 2 South, on the Oriental, has again turned out poorly in comparison with the others, the yield of 8 dwt. per ton not more than paying working expenses. On several occasions I have reported an apparent improve ment in this claim ; it seems, however, that the gold is in such small patches, that no reliance can be placed in the production of an occasional few tons of good stone Messrs. Cotsworth and Wood are now raising their quartz by means of a whip, the depth and quantity of quartz raised requiring more power than can be used with a windlass. On Murray's Reef the whole party have been engaged in making preparations for their machinery, which is in the course of erection."], [517, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 NOVEMBER. 489 Buckland Division.

In quartz mining it is very different, where the labor of years merely suffices to prospect the ground for further operations, the temporary absence of two or three partners in a claim The crushing machines shown in the above table are the most important in my division, and are kept pretty constantly at work with their own quartz and that sent by the public. There are many more, also good first-class crushing machines, but not so constantly at work as those above specified. does not much signify, when there are always those remaining sufficient to carry on the work, although, through negligence, it has been the cause of a few abandonments taking place. The mining interest generally is looking very quiet in my district this month. There is little or no speculation going on, and no more outlay of capital amongst the miners than what is unavoidably necessary to retain what little interest each may hold in any of their at pre sent unremunerative quartz claims. There have been several new finds this month throughout the district. In Laddams and Company's Claim, Garden Gully Reef, a new lead has been struck 3 feet thick, under lying south, situated to the west of the old line ; the first crushing, which has just been retorted, yielded 2 oz. to the ton. Several shafts are being sunk for the same lead. The exodus of the population from this dis trict has been large, yet not more so than might have been expected from the various vivid accounts which have from time to time appeared in our local journals, together with the news from private sources, from the New Zealand and Lachlan gold-fields; and this is There have been also two prospecting claims registered this month, both at Back Creek,"], [519, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 NOVEMBER. 491 parallel and within 200 yards of each other.

The claim south of the prospectors' on Dead Cat Reef, and situated on the south site of the range, looking over Spring Gully, have just struck the reef which was lost in the prospect ing claim. They have had two crushings ; the last one yielded 3 oz. per ton, and their crushing returned them a cake of over 60 oz of gold. This reef has always been considered au outside one. The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 15s. 3d. to \u00a33 15s. 6d. per oz. Mining pursuits in general have not during the past month undergone any material change, and though the population at first somewhat increased by a number of miners returning from New Zealand, the neighborhood round Huntly and other places is being rapidly deserted, attributable to the rush to the Lach lan diggings. Eaglehawk and Huntly Divisions. (George William Hart, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 In quartz mining matters are comparatively dull ; the lately discovered reef mentioned in my last report, the Black Forest Reef pros pecting claim, is turning out very well, the breadth of the reef is five feet, and the quartz obtained therefrom looks exceedingly well and promises a handsome return. The prospecting parties in the Old Whipstick have been successful in several places, the sinking is mostly shallow, about 60 feet ; sfime of the miners who have taken up claims are getting pretty well remunerated for their trouble. I am fully of opinion that many good reefs will yet be found in that locality. The Elysian Flat miners, few as they are, are making fresh efforts to work the reefs in that neighborhood. One crushing machine is now being constantly employed. Remarks. \u2014 This return is as nearly correct ns can be ascertained, under the present fluc tuating state of the population. The machinery is as follows: \u2014 The late rains have given an abundant supply of water, puddlers' dams are being en larged, and many applications for new sites have been made. In Eaglehawk Gully and its vicinity this branch of mining looks well on the whole, one lease has been applied for by a party of pud dlers. The ground in that neighborhood has been rushed several times and abandoned, and re-worked, yet though the earnings of many of those employed may be small, they seem to be sufficient to prevent the ground from being deserted. On the Pottery Lead, at Huntly, business looks rather brisk than otherwise. In several claims the deep lead has been touched at 108 to 120 feet; some of the claims on this lead have returned as much as 2 oz. per load; a load of alluvial washing stuff weighs about \\\\ ton.

In quartz nothing is doing at present. King Parrot \u2014 The two claims, Fortune's and Martin's, are working steadily and with good prospects, but no quantity of quartz has been crushed as yet. Mountain Rush\u2014 Matters are going on very quietly here ; those at work are doing well, but there is no increase to the population. in pumping and raising washing stuff, and it is confidently anticipated that the Ironstone Lead will be struck in a few days. The North Star Gold Mining Company, who reached the bottom about three weeks since are down 112 feet, have opened out and are driv ing, as it is probable that the Ironstone and Pottery Leads will join in this company's ground ; it is not ascertained which of the two has been struck. A crushing of the washing stuff (cement) yielded 12 dwt. to the load. The difficulties of sinking on the whole line are great, owing to the water and drift, the wliole requires slabbing, and there is no doubt that only by such companies, and with the aid of steam power to conquer the flow of water, that our deep leads can be fully tested. Re newed efforts are again made to discover the lost lead at the northern extremity of the line, and several parties are now prospecting for that purpose. Heathcote and Wabaxga Divisions. (Blayney W.

The reef is about 6 inches thick, and promises to be of great richness. No stone has been yet crushed. The puddlers in and around Heathcote are doing well and obtaining very good wages. At Fiddler's Flat, Ford's Gully, Surface Hill, Golden Gully, Wattle Flat, Mosquito Gully, and several other localities, there are large numbers of men working with apparently satisfactory results. On both sides of the range dividing the waters of the Mclvor and Wild Duck Creeks are numerous gullies, some untried, and others but partially worked. These no doubt would pay well were steam machinery employed, and an unlimited supply of water obtainable. Large portions of the hills and most of the gullies could be easily and very profitably sluiced. The construction of the proposed reservoir commanding the whole of the hitherto tried parts of the Mclvor gold field, and all the tops of the ranges not yet worked, will, I am of opinion, be of great and lasting benefit, by giving a new impetus to mining speculation, and tend to induce parties to undertake such works as will aid in developing the now dormant resources of this portion of the district. Since my last report mining enterprise has been progressing slowly, but steadily. Although no event of startling importance has taken place, the reefs have been yielding their usual good returns, and in spite of the imperfect and expensive method of working pursued by the miners, a comparison with the other gold producing districts entitles the Heathcote and Waranga divisions to claim prominency among the richest. Heathcote Division \u2014 Heathcote Proper. \u2014 The Long Gully Company have obtained 2\\ oz. per ton out of 120 tons crushed at Mr. Stephenson's Chilian mill. They are now raising stone by contract. The Caledonia Mclvor Company have struck the reef in their claim. They are now getting out stone for crushing. Hitherto the yield obtained has been averaging 8 oz. to the ton. The United Balmoral Company have struck water in their shaft. Norris Reef Company are still obtaining good dividends ; the last stone crush averaged \"2\\ oz. to the ton. The claims on Parkin's Reef, Slaughter yard Hill, have all been registered. The last crushings produced an average of over half an ounce to the ton, at a depth of 20 feet. The reef is about 4 feet thick, and could be easily and profitably worked with machinery on the ground. A new reef has been struck on the Red Hill, on the south-western angle of the municipal boundary, by Messrs. Honey and party, at a Costerfield. \u2014 This once busy part of the Heathcote division is now deserted, the miners having, with but three exceptions, registered their claims, and gone elsewhere to try their Name of Company.

These reefs, unlike the ones at Rushworth, are nearly ver tical without any underly ; they, therefore, offer singular facilities for being easily and in expensively worked, especially as the ground requires no timbering whatever Mr. Lewis is still crashing large quantities of refuse quartz and sandstone casing from the Balaclava Hill; with what results I have been unable to ascertain. 2\u00a3 tons of stone from Sen's clgim, on the Mysterious Reef, yielded 1 1 dwt. to the ton : the vein is from 1 6 to 24 inches thick, and wiU no doubt pay. It is worthy of remark that the claim from which the stone was taken has been unworked for years. fortunes. Want of means to carry on the works has been the reason for this step, and I regret being compelled again to repeat that that want is only caused by the very imperfect and crude way in which all mining operations are entered into and conducted here. It appears to be an opinion pretty generally entertained on this gold field, that any know ledge of mining science or expenditure of labor or money is unnecessary to ensure an imme diate return to those engaged in its operations. Hence numerous and frequent failures occur caused by ignorance and impatience, and a bad name is given to a locality for which there is no just cause. That the present desertion of the Costerfield mines is not attributable to their unremunera tive character is evident from the fact that some samples of crude antimony sent to Eng land as having no gold, for the purpose of merely ascertaining the value of the mineral itself, yielded on assay, one portion 3f oz. of gold to the ton, the other 4J oz. to the ton. This information was received by a merchant of Heathcote from his brother in England, to whom the antimony was consigned. It speaks but little for the energy and enter prise of a community, when the knowledge of such a fact should have no power to rouse them into activity. Although the antimony mines of Costerfield have been traced for a length of four miles by a width of upwards of three miles, still no one seems disposed to stretch out his hand to grasp the fortune awaiting him, and Costerfield still continues deserted. Most of the old abandoned claims are being again taken up and are found to be payable Large quantities also of refuse quartz and sandstone are being crushed, and yield very handsome returns. Some very rich stone has been struck in Clarke and Doyle's Reef, at the Kilmore road. The gold is nuggety, and well distributed throughout the stone. In the alluvial working but little is being done. Some of the ground at the head of the Forty Feet is being worked and is found payable. The puddling company, at the Butchers' Gully Cement Lead, are getting very good dirt, and their claim promises to be highly re munerative. Large fields of auriferous cement exist here and at Rushworth that would be certain to yield good dividends to any enterprising party who would erect machinery on them. Both at Whroo and Rushworth a great want is felt for a water supply. The small dams thrown up by the miners being found insuffi cient during the dry season, and a stop being consequently put to all work For domestic purposes so deficient is the supply that water has to be carted from Mur chison, a distance of twelve miles. In conclusion I beg to direct attention to the exhibits of antimony and gold \u2014 antimony quartz and gold now in the Exhibition from this district The blocks are from the claims of Messrs. Field, Coster, and Company (the prospectors), and Messrs. Murray and Com pany. Each block is from a separate lode, and the produce from these mines have averaged as high as 6^ oz. to the ton. In these blocks the gold is not so easily visible to the naked eye, but if estimated at the rate produced by assay, in England, they would not be considered very rich. Redcastle. \u2014 The mines of Redcastle con tribute to the importance of that district. The Victoria Reef, Curly Dog Gully, the different reefs at Staffordshire Flat, Clarke's, Faithful and Welcome Reefs, and Cocksey's Reef, with one or two others, still maintain their character for rich productiveness. The cost of raising the stone and working the mines have always appeared to me exces sive, and a thorough reform is necessary here as elsewhere to render the place attractive to the mining speculator. A better title to mining property than at present existing is also needed in this district to induce the investment of capital. Waranga. \u2014 Rushworth. \u2014 The returns from this place although imperfect, give some idea of its capabilities as a quartz producing gold field. The average yields, being over 1 oz to the ton, show what might be expected with improved machinery and greater co-operation among the miners themselves, together with a complete revolution in the method of working their mines. Good machinery, with plenty of water, is much needed at Costerfield. The alluvial workings still continue to yield fair wages to those working them, and the place generally is progressively prosperous. Whroo. \u2014 A glance at the statistical tables A careful analysis of the ore would, I am convinced, disclose the existence of more than one other valuable product."], [525, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 NOVEMBER. 497 The whole of the country from the Mclvor to the Waranga offers much of interest to the geologist and the man of science, and any time spent in its examination would be well employed.

Amherst Division. (Chas. Cole, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 there are about 50 men busily employed ; the sinking is 80 feet, thickness of wash-dirt from 12 to 18 inches, with an average yield of 1 6 dwt. to the load. It is very generally believed ihat the Emu Lead is making for Gibraltar, and will ultimately join it A small rush took place a few days ago to a spot known as Hong-Kong, about three quarters of a mile east of the Liverpool Arms Hotel, on the road between Carisbrook and Back Creek. Sinking shallow, from 10 to 14 feet; the wash-dirt from 4 to 8 inches thick, and the yield irregular. A peculiarity in this neighbor hood is that the deepest ground is the least valuable, some shafts which have been bottomed having proved worthless. Another small rush, not far from the one referred to, and designated Slaughter-yard Hill, has lately been giving employment to about 160 men, who were attracted to the spot in consequence of the finding of a 50-oz. nugget there. The sinking is also shallow, not deeper than from 8 to 12 feet, and the results various, made up of a portion of a series of patches of which it would be almost impossible to give an average. The machinery is as follows: Eighteen prospecting claims h ,ve been regis tered during the mouth, five in alluvial ground and the remainder on quartz reefs. From the latter the results of the crushings have not yet been stated ; the former give returns from 10 dwt. to I oz to the load. There will soon be a considerable addition to the mining machinery in this division, a party from Ballaarat being now engaged in erecting an engine for crushing and pumping purposes, on the Leviathan Eeef Chinaman's Mat. This engine will be the largest in the neighborhood, viz., 75 horse-power. Considerable activity is shown by the miners at the northern end of Chinaman's Flat Lead, the prospects obtained by the Hit or Miss Company being of a very encouraging nature.

Charge per ton for crushing cement from 9s. to 12s. J. W. Gonagle's steam engine of 16 horse power, that he had erected on his lease, has been removed out of the division. I beg to report that but little change has taken place in mining matters during the month. The New Zealand and Laehlan rushes have induced many miners to leave this district for these places, and particularly those possessing a little capital, and as a consequence has caused things to be rather duller here than usual. In the vicinity of Amherst Flat. Mia Mia Flat, Kangaroo Flat, &c , the majority of the miners are making what they term a good living. Quartz Mining. \u2014 The reef recently opened about half a mile to the south of Mount Glas gow promises so far to be one of the best ever opened in the division, the first trial crushing of 2 tons yielded 3 oz. 6 dwt. 12 gr., but since then the stone has improved considerably in richness ; the owners have now nearly 300 tons on the surface which they intend crushing the week before Christmas, they estimate it to yield 4 oz. per ton ; the stone is of a highly ferruginous nature, and the owners state they have found several nuggets from 4 to 10 oz. imbedded in the casing of the reef. The thickness of the lode is from 3 to 4 feet, and present depth 2S feet. On Rocky Flat Lead there are about 400 miners steadily at work, and the majority have been doing remarkably well for some time past The week before last Nos. 22 and 23 obtain, d 70 oz. of gold ; and the other day while visit- ing the lead I saw one bucket of stuff washed from this claim which yielded 12 oz. of gold, this of course was considered a patch, but the generality of the ground is highly remunerative. The Independent Company have been dividing lately from \u00a310 to \u00a315 per week per man Nos. 12 and 13 have been doing equally well The majority of these companies have blocks of ground sufficiently large to keep them in work for the next two years Scandinavian Lead. \u2014 With the exception of a few companies working extended claims there is but comparatively little doing on this lead. The White Star Company, who went to considerable expense in procuring steam machinery, find the ground, so far as yet tested, the reverse of encouraging, they hope however shortly to come across grpund of a more promising description. Mount Greenock Lead. \u2014 At the present time this lead is supporting a population of about 150 miners, and notwithstanding the difficulties they have to contend with in the shape of rock and water, the majority appear satisfied with the amount of their earnings. The United Dodd and Company, on the Star Reef, have about 40 tons raised which they intend crushing shortly ; the reef is from 8 to 10 feet in thick ness, and taken indiscriminately yields from 1 J oz. to 2 oz. per ton; present depth 19 feet. From the Carnubian Reef 30 tons have been crashed which yielded 21 oz. ; the company are making from \u00a38 to \u00a310 per week per man. From the Staffordshire Reef, at a depth of 45 feet, 23 tons have been crashed which yielded 16 oz. 1 dwt. 2 gr. ; the lode is from 1 J to 2 feet thick.

At the rash referred to. the depth of sinking is about 70 feet, and the prospectors have been washing about 2 oz. per load. As there is a considerable quantity of water in the ground very few holes have yet been bottomed although a great many shafts are being sunk, and so far as I could learn, those who are on the lead are very well satisfied with their prospects. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 With respect to quartz mining in this division, there has been a great improvement during the present month. On the Slaughteryard Reef, (claim Nos. 2 and 3 South, amalgamated) the main lode has been struck at a depth of 108 feet, and the result of the first crushing was 6 oz. per ton. On the Waterloo Reef a large body of quartz has also been struck, which yielded a return of 5 oz. per ton. Total value of all mining plant in the divii ision, \u00a360,800. On the Pyrenees Reef (claim No. 5 South), exceedingly rich quartz has been struck, but I am unable to state the yield, as they have not finished crushing. From the prospectors' claim on this reef 1 5 cwt. of specimens yielded 500 oz. This large quantity was obtained by hand crushing alone. The tailings from the above were crushed at Simpson and Company's machine, and yielded 88 oz. The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 16s. 3d. to \u00a33 16s. 6d. per oz. No information has been obtained during the month to enable me to give the quantity of quartz crushed, and the yield of gold per ton. The principal mill owners refuse to give the required information. I may state that, from the steady increase in the yield from the various reefs, the share holders throughout this portion of the district appear to have a daily increasing confidence in their remunerative character. The population has fluctuated considerably during the month, many having gone to the Lachlan and New Zealand, and many more preparing to go. Alluvial mining is in a tolerably healthy state throughout the division. No leases have been applied for this month. At Burnt Creek many are doing well, and the workings are spreading over a great ex tent of ground. Dunolly Division. The population of this place is about 2500. (R. J. McMillan, Mining Surveyor.) Cochran's diggings continue to improve. Its population is 1 1 50. It has three steam crushing machines, and if there was plenty of water that number would soon increase, but it is notoriously the worst off place in the division for water, and there is a probability of the supply becoming exhausted in a few weeks' time The population is as follows : \u2014 Inkermann and Wattle Flat support a popu lation of about 900.

There were about 1500 or 1800 persons on the ground, and a much larger proportion of men at work than is generally the case in a new rush where the shepherding laws exist. The average this month, as will be seen from annexed statement, amounts to 2 oz. 13 dwt. per ton. The celebrated Columbian Prospecting Claim have this week struck a new lode considerably to the east of that which they struck 12 months ago, and which proved so very rich. Very nearly the whole of the puddling ma chines in the district arc in full working order, in consequence of the copious supply of rain we have had lately, and the returns are satis factory. The stone they have now struck appears to be altogether a separate reef being of a very much lighter color. The specimens (2 buckets lull) which I saw from this new lode quite equals, if it does not excel the previous one. The amount of rain which has fallen during the past few days will enable the surface claim holders and the holders of dams to store suffi cient water to last them several weeks, a great boon up here, as in nearly all cases the alluvial miners support their mates during the time they are endeavoring to find reefs. The reef was found at 80 feet from the surface, and is from 2 to 3 feet in thickness. A reef at the head of Evans's Gully, Glen alliyii, has been reported as being enormously rich, but as the party have not yet had time to get any of the stone crushed, the exact yield is not known. It was found very near the surface and when struck was about 10 inches thick on the cap. St. Arnaud Division. (Charles H. Raven, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 A great many companies have now got down to the water level, and have registered their claims for the purpose of obtaining machinery for baling. All the crashing machines in working order have been fully employed during the month. I have nothing new or different from last month to report of Jericho, or Korong, either as regards quartz reefing or alluvial mining. The Hope Frontage Lead, at Old Inglewood. has taken a very considerable \" slew,\" throw ing those who were sinking on the supposed course quite out, and compelling them to sink new shafts. The gold which is obtained from this lead is paying good wages.

Fy fe and Company's Claim, Greenock Keef, Peters. The division of St Arnaud, like its neigh bors, has suffered somewhat in the number of its mining population, although not sufficiently so to affect its vitality. The Lachlan River rush is apparently the cause; but I have not the slightest doubt many of the disappointed, on their return southward, will seek safety and repair here, as they have hitheito done from almost every other rush. The reefs south of St. Amand are again looking up. Messrs. Fyfe and Company, on the Greenock Reef, have lately crushed a kiln of 50 tons, yielding 2J oz. per ton. A new reef, called the Pioneer, has also been discovered about half a mile farther south of Greenock Reef, and from the sample of stone bids fair to rival its northern neighbor.

I have to report that mining operations have partaken much of the general dullness, the only relief being occasional finds in the old alluvial workings, or the still richer yields from some of our quartz reefs, as per returns above. On Barker's Creek neither companies nor claimholders are doing anything worthy of record. The machinery of the Capper's Reef Com pany has been removed to Muckleford. Alluvial mining especially continues very quiet since the New Zealand excitement, and from several letters lately received communi cating instances of success on that gold field, there appears every probability of puddlers and others possessing a little capital migrating there, preferring the chance of a good find in new ground to a steady return from our old workings, from which, although lately there have been many finds of sma'l patches con taining several ounces each, only long days and persevering energy will ensure remune rative returns. Fryer's Crf.ek Division. (R L. M. Kitto, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 In quartz mining, although so large a num ber of reefs have been opened and large yields obtained therefrom, comparatively few are now being worked, and of these the major portion are j ust paying expenses. The Bolivia Reef maintains its character. The Ajax Company have been busily em ployed increasing the crushing capabilities of their machinery, since which their first cleaning up, 95 tons (four days' work), produced 195 oz.. and last week they reduced 130 tons, the yield being 528 oz., the best week's return yet, caus ing increased confidence in the reef. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Bolivia Company have nearly completed the erection of their machinery, and continue to break out rich stone ; their prospects are considered equal to the Ajax Company's. The private claimholders between the two companies are actively employed sinking shafts to cut the lodes yielding so well on either side. On the Cumberland Reef quartz has again been found by Hutton and Company, yielding above 3 oz. per ton The adjoining considerable portion of this reef is held by the purchasers of the late company's machinery, who, however, are idle, being afraid to speculate by opening the mine, without which they cannot'expect to be successful Occupation. \u00a7 z 9 z- z z a C 3 I ai 1 1 na illuvial miners 2,000 4,000 6,000 luartz miners 160 160 ither population 4,003 4,000 Totals 6,160 4,000 10,1 Description. ii O < 9 ti Kl 9 3 Alluvial mining : \u2014 Steam engines crashing cement Steam engines washing ...

The following information has been obtained relative to the quantity of Quartz crushed during the month, and the Gold obtained therefrom : \u2014 No new feature has presented itself in my division during the month of November. The miners are working, if anything more con tentedly than they have been for some mouths past As the unsettling influence of the New Zealand rush has passed over, and another lesson been taught our mining population, it is possible that there will be fewer fluctuations lor some months at least. Garvin and Company, of Windlass Hill, are making from \u00a3'0 to \u00a340 per week to each share ; this wage is earned from ground that has been two or three times worked. In quartz mining little or nothing is being done McTavish and Company, of Mopoke Reef, are making good wages out of a reef that was considered worthless some time since ; it is yielding better than any other claim in my division M: ny such reefs, are lying idle for the want of a fair trial. Many of the puddlers are already complain ing of the scarcity of water: and are anxiously looking out for a supply from the Government reservoirs. I have \u25a0 no doubt that if on ly a reasonable and fair price is put on the water, but that the reservoirs will be extensively patronised. Scotson and Company, also of the Mopoke Reef, are making good wages The Ferron's Reef Company are making little returns, although they are briskly at work. Heron's Hill has shown no signs of improve ment, although the miners are busily at work, knowing as they do from experience, that nothing can be done except by perseverence. On Table Hill all the available ground is being worked, and this once famous hill is being fast gutted out, like all other portions of the diggings, however I expect it will have another tin n over bye and bye. At Pickpocket the Chinese are working steadily and briskly, they have it all to them selves and appear to be contented with their earnings; the population is steadily increasing in this quarter. Notwithstanding the general depression of the times many of our miners are making wages and something over. Tyack and Com pany, of Golden Gully, have been making during the last six months from \u00a34 to *I5 per week to each man's share. HErBURN Division.

The machinery is as follows: old discovered reefs fully keep up their reputa tion, and, on the whole, affairs are in a mast satisfactory state. Among the principal reefs working in Jim Crow, I may mention \u2014 Melvin's Reef, head of Bl.nd Creek.\u2014 T his ri cf, so often prospected without leading to any satisfactory results, has again been taken up by H. Bleakley. an old experienced quartz miner of Jim Crow, and he appears very sanguine of bringing matters to a successful issue ; and from all 1 know of the reef, I have no doubt that it will eventually prove highly remunerative On Wombat Reef, Wombat Hill, the Cornish party is, as usual, successfully engaged, and keeping their engine steadily employed. 'Their crashing machine on \\\\ ombat Flat, crushing for hire, has, during the greater part of last month, been under repair, but is now nearly ready to recommence operations. The Havelock Quartz Mining Company, adjoining North, is also, as far as I can learn, getting on very well ; and Messrs. Urcenlell and Company, the next party, arc.

Number of distinct quartz reels which have been actually proved to be auriferous lo the present time, 68. The price of gold during the month in the division has been, from \u00a33 16s. to \u00a33 16s per oz. The Fearnought Company, in Camp street, are, as usual, doing first-rate. T hey ha\\ e, during the last fortnight, crushed about 2HU tons of quartz, and divided last Saturday, \u00a393 per man. The Pioneer Company have been crushing Iheir own quartz, but the manager declines furnishing any information Messrs. Thompson and Company, in private property west of Camp street, whose alleged encroachment upon the Fearnought Company's claim in the street has caused the protracted lawsuit between the parties, have been sinking their shaft deeper, but I have no knowledge of their last operations. I have this month again unsuccessfully applied to the different owners of crushing machines on Jim Crow for returns of crushings, but they are all disinclined to furnish such returns, alleging that the miners generally do not desire to have the pioduce of their claims published. Quartz Mining. \u2014 In the Jim Crow portion of the division this branch of mining is gradually getting into favor with the miners, owing, in a great measure, to the continued splendid yields of some of the reefs working, and partly, per haps, to its being too late in the season for parties having worked out their puddling or sluicing claims to prospect, for new ground. In several instances very promising prospects have been obtained on new opened reefs and although nothing very definite can be said of them ns yet. still a confidence in quartz mining opernlions is gradually being awakened that ( yet hope to -e bearing brilliant fruits The Messrs. Bleakley and Company, in the private properly adjoining, realised from one of their late crushings about \u00a320 per man per week, and the quartz they are now raising is confi dently expected to prove equally remunerative. Vickery and Company, partly in private property, partly on Crown hinds, have not lately been so successful as formerly, and are now sinking a fifth shaft with a view of striking the north-western dip of the reef. tin Collier's Reef matters are rather quiet, and I have heard <l no crushings during November Description. ii **** > a 3 I s fr. 9 \u2022P is \u2014 Alluvial mining: \u2014 Steam engines employed in pumping, winding, &c. 1 2 5 131 6 30 Whims Horse puddling machines 180 Quartz mining: \u2014 Steam engines employed in pumping, winding, crush- ing, &c s ; *7 15 Crushing machines worked by water-wheels 4 ... 3 2 Whims"], [537, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 NOVEMBER. 509 Sampson and Company, wiiosc last crushing averaged about I -J oz. per ton, with a consider able body of quartz, have registered their claim, with a view of procuring machinery. and the Hong-Kong Company, on Emu Reef, are also in a dormant slate. On Adelaide Reef, head of Don't Wake'm, matters are flourishing as ever. The latest crashing from that reef is now at Adam's mill, Old Tom's Gnlly, and is expected to yield 3 to 4 oz. per ton, the parcel being 50 tons. Woodworth and Company arc stiT pros pecting without any definite result ; Connelly's and Crohzicr's claims arc registered ; and Brown and Company's claim is also apparently at a stand until the tunnel started by that company reaches the reef. From the Prince Llewellyn Company, at Parker's Specimen Reef, Dry Diggings, I learn that the company has principally been engaged crushing the refuse stuff left by the former owners, and the average yield has been some thing about oz. per ton. Between the heads of Doctor's Gully and Cobbler's Gully, a reef, called Luthei's Reef, is being prospected, and some very promising stone has been obtained, but whether the quantity will be sufficient to pay remains to be seen. I am also informed that during the last few days a new reef has been discovered at the head of Cobbler's Gully, near Ihe Old Race course road, the gold being coarser than usually found in quartz reefs. The next party north Willgoss and Com pany, are still raising very good stone, and the same is the case with the adjoining party, Simpson and Company. On Sportsman's Reef, Messrs. Betty, Son, aud Company have not yet completed their reser voir, and in their shaft a new promising vein has been struck. At Doctor's Gully a new reef, called Bcnoit's Eeef, is being prospected, and Gabriel's Reef is about being taken up by a party now forming. Hartley's Reef, and Prince of Wales Reefs are prospecting in the same locality, but as yet with no results, at least not definite. In Yandoit nothing of importance has occurred in quartz mining; in fact, the greater number of claims are at a stand still for various reasons. At Spring Creek, a company called the Spring Cnek Quartz Mining Company, has been foimcd to prospect a ices of which rumor s.ysthatat several places first-rate prospects have been obtained in years bygone, when quartz reefs were not thought of. On Trogish Reef, the only ground now occu pied, is held by Mr. Morison. the proprietor of a crushing machine on the Jim Crow Creek, who has hitherto been principally engaged in preliminary works, such as cleaning up and securing the old workings A quantity of refuse stuff left on the ground by the origiual prospectors yielded about 4 dwt. per ton. On Adam's New Reef, head of Old Tom's Gnlly, matters continue prosperous as usual. The most southern claim, held by Hoff and Company, is now down 175 feet, and the water becoming so heavy that the contractors sinking the shaft have been obliged to suspend opera tions ; and I believe the company intend opening out at that level, although it certainly would have been advisable, as the company first intended, to have sunk 200 feet before opening out. In Bontant and Company's claim, where lately one crushing produced 1 cwt. of the precious metal I am informed some still richer vein has been struck ; the vein is very thin, but the yield my informant states will be something extraordinary. On the Glamorganshire Reef several claims are at work, but gold has not yet been struck payable beyond Claims Nos 1, 2, ;,nd 3 North Hamburg Reef is also dull at present, and will probably not revive before the Hamburg Reef Quartz Alining Company commence active operations. On Pioneer Reef, the Pioneer Quartz Mining Company are to all appearances briskly at work, but the manager, declines giving any information as to yield, &c. A number of claims have been taken up farther north, and the parties are busy sinking On Cooper's Reef, situate about one mile farther south towards the Great Dividing Range, where some three or four years ago gold was obtained in the surface stones and where some six weeks ago a prospecting claim was taken up, payable gold is reported to have liccn struck and a number of claims have been taken up in consequence. The adjoining claims south, on the same reef, not already held under lease, have been applied for by the holders under the style of the Spring Vale Company, under the leasing regulations; and northwards the claims are, with one or two exceptions, rcgisteied. On Malcolm's Reef, in private property, the reef looks as well as ever, but I have not as yet received any returns from the crushing machines in Candor's, ami can therefore state notbing.detinite as to yield &c. The Warion Hastings Company, on Adam's I'M Keef, have not yet comrr enced operations ;"], [538, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 NOVEMBER. 510 The principal new reefs discovered during the month, are \u2014 working, one of them as far as I can learn, paying very well. Frenchman's Reef, Blind Creek, where a reef about 1 foot thick, and probably yielding about 1 to 1^ oz per ton has bean discovered in the prospecting claim. In Yandoit, Frenchman's Hill, and Bald Hill, Shicer's Gully, are still paying hand somely, and several prospecting tunnels are going into the same chain of hills, and it ia pretty generally believed that the same run of gold will be found continued through the whole chaim. Victoria Reef, between Sailors' and Stony Creeks The vein here discovered is certainly thickly impregnated with the precious metal, but the thickness to a depth of about 30 feet does not exceed a couple of inches. The prospectors are following it in the hope that it will ultimately lead into a reef. Alluvial sinking has, in the western portion of Jim Crow, been rather prosperous during the last month, but the principal workings, Whiskey lead, near Champagne Gully, is now almost worked out, after having through out ils whole length paid well on an average, as much as 3 or 4 oz having occasionally been got to a tub The lead is traced into Mr, Egan's station, leased for mining purposes by a Ballaarat party. And two reefs, as yet unnamed, near China man's Flat, where fair prospects have been obtained, and from which probably quartz will will be crushed during December. Besides these a number of reefs are being prospected, and fair prospects have been ob tained both at Jim Crow and Yandoit, and it may reasonably be expected that some of them will eventually turn out remunerative. At Blanket Flat no definite results have as yet been arrived at regarding the existence of a deep lead ; but the prospecting shaft is ex pected to bottom in a few weeks, and there is every reason to believe, on the deep ground, and miners in that locality are all on the look out for a rash In the surrounc ing gullies a few parties are at wori;, but not attended, as far as I can learn, with any very brilliant success In Daylesford the Township Lead is now only being worked in Fleming's and Kirwan's paddock, heading for the police paddock, occupied by the Wombat Hill Gold Mining Company. This company are about erecting steam machinery and the boiler pur chased from the Pickpocket Gold Mining Com pany arrived on the ground last week. South of the paddock, Messrs Spence aud Company are occupying a claim uuder Queensberry street, worked by means of a tunnel, but I have no reliable information as to proceeds. The adjoining ground is occupied by Messrs. Salmon and I ompany. whose tunnel is yet in the course of being driven, as is also Messrs. Spellacy and Company's, next. In puddling and sluicing I have no change to report The summer is beginning to have its effect upon the water supply, but not as yet to any injurious extent In Blind Creek a number of claims have lately been takcu up, owing chiefly to the ground being wet, and the water supply gene rally sufficient for puddling du.ing the gi eater part of the summer and I expect very little of the low ground in that locality will be left unoccupied during the summer. On Chinaman's Flat the greater number of claims are gradually getting worked out, and although the miners there engaged, by their systematic manner of working, bring a very small quantity of gold to pay. still it is hardly expected that the remaining sound ground will be found remunerative j\\o new ground adapted for these modes of washing has been opened during the month, and on the whole, the state of atlairs, if not improved, are at least in as fair condition as usual. Near the Spring Creek road, immediately north of the township, a shaft has been bottomed at 210 feet, and the party reports having driven 70 feet and struck payable gold, but were, by excess of water, compelled to suspend operations. They are now intending to procure machinery and sink a new shalt on the deep ground discovered, and propose selling five more shares, the company consisting of seven shares at present. Tunnelling has, during the month past, received no perceptible addition. A few ex tended claims on the Italian Hill, Wombat (. reek, have been taken up, but the results of any of them will not be known for several months. I have, however, very little doubt that deep ground will be found leading from the Italian Hill into the Daylesford township, and that, in fact, deep sinking in that locality will be come the order of the day. On the rest of the Basaltic hills the usual sameness exists, and no new localities have been discovered The late rush to Glengower is gradually subsiding, and only two or three claims ate as yet The Shepherd's Flat Company has been erecting and fixing a cylinder lor washing purposes, and has only so lately got in woik ing trim that nothing can be said as yet of the company's chance of success. In Yandoit the alluvial sinking presents but a very dull appearance."], [539, "MINISG SL'RYEVOIts' REPORTS \u2014 SOVEMB KK. 511 Iu New Nuggety Gully the company has hroken up, and the ground is again being fossicked over by the individual miner, with but small chance of success, for the ground is pretty well worked, and the whole of the gully full of water. In Old Miggety Gully and Forty Foot a few parties are still at work, but I do not hear of any of these extraordinary finds for which Yandoit was once so famous. Shicer's Cully is paying pretty well in a few claims, and there is a probability that the lead may continue into the flat along Yandoit Creek. The flat is, however, very wet, and will not be able to be worked before the driest part of the summer. The alluvial companies in Yandoit are. one after the other, disappearing. They have all got gold in their respective claims, but the ground will not pay for its being worked on a large scale, the gold generally being found in a few very narrow gutters, and the quantity of stuff, therefore, not being adequate to keep the machines employed. The last of these companies, the Grand Junction, have also suspended operations, whether for good I know not.

They are mostly employed about the valley of the Back Creek, from Taradale southward for three miles ; many of them are working on private lands, for which they are content to pay a high price, even to the rate of \u00a340 per acre. Respecting population, there have been some few arrivals of Europeans, but the influx has been balanced by about the same amount of departures. In the township of Taradale there has been considerable excitement of late by the opening up to the diggers, (by the municipality) the street reserves Although to a great extent the streets had been cut up by the miners formerly ; yet such depredations having been stopped by the police, several leads of auriferous drifts were cut off from mining operations by the intervention of both street reserves, and also private allotments. Under the present arrangement, which imposes due restrictions to guard the public weal, these leads of gold will be fully traced out, and by such an uninterupted course afforded the miners, no doubt but further discoveries will be made. The Liberty Flat Company have obtained during the month 40 oz of gold, which is a better return than of late; and it shows the considerable quantity overlooked when the ground was formerly worked.

There are three other tunnels being wrought at, but the rest are abandoned At the Ironstone Hill, three miles south of Taradale, there have been five plots of two acres each taken up lately on old worked ground ; it is private property. Other applications are pending. This is the rich lead worked some five years ago, and where the Coliban Company, sub sequently had their works ; but the ground has been long unoccupied as far as mining is concerned. There arc about fifty quartz miners in this field, and with others who obtain employment by reason of the mines, including women and children, would raise the population to 100 or thereabouts. 'Ihe best return of gold yield during the month has been from a crashing of 26 tons out of Bassett and Company's claim, on the Southern Reef, near Snodgrass Gully, which yielded 44 oz.

The population is as follows : \u2014 Malmsbury Gold Field. \u2014 There has been a discovery of auriferous alluvium at the Kangaroo Creek, about three miles south south-west from Malmsbury, situate in a small hollow, leading from the Kangaroo Reef, westerly towards the creek. About seventy miners are steadily engaged at this spot. The depth of sinking varies from three to fifteen feet. Three horse puddling machines are in course of construction, as puddling is considered the most advantageous process of reducing the wash-dirt, which is but poor. One party has taken up three-quarters of an acre of shallow and abandoned ground to work by the above method At the Coliban diggings, in tuis same field, there are about 200 miners employed in the various workings of alluvial and quartz. The flat along the river, and in the vicinity of the Coliban Reef, is found to be auriferous to a wide extent Six new horse puddling machines are being put up, in addition to two formerly made and working. On the Coliban Reef only three claims are being worked at. In No. 2 South the party has struck gold In Claim No. 1, five tons were lately crushed, which yielded at the rate of 3 oz per ton, which is about an average for this lode ; some crushings have yielded as high a rate as 6 oz. 1-iemarks. \u2014 The decrease is caused by the miners leaving for the Lachlan rush. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Victoria Gold Field. \u2014 In the Victoria field mining operations seem at their lowest ebb ; only one quartz mine is being worked at. which is Leslie and Ross's, on Ashtonia Reef.

I have the honor to report that the alluvial diggings are in much the same state as last month, with the exception of Nuggety Flat which has suffered a large decrease in the population, the miners leaving for the Lachlan rush. The lead is still extending northwards and is getting deep and wet. In the Muckleford District water is getting scarce, and the men are registering their claims until it can be procured. The lead near New stead has not been extended farther west, and several diggers are leaving for the Lachlan. Two extended claims for sluicing have been taken up on the Loddon, within two miles of the township. At Pickpocket the Washing Companies have all ceased to exist. The ground of McKay, Leith, and Company has been taken up by private parties. At Strangways a great number of miners are leaving for the Lachlan, very few being left with the exception of Chinamen. The Porcupine Washing Company have washed 1000 loads which yielded 50 oz., an improvement on last month's returns. The Maldon Washing Company is being wound up, the ground not proving payable.

Sugarloaf Creek, and Arthur's Creek, with about forty gullies and numerous flats on the Back Creek, none of which have been prospected yet. although indications of gold are to be met with in every one of them. A rush has taken place to the upper part of Hoddle's Creek during the past month, and extensive sluicing operations are being carried on there at present. This, I have no doubt will be the principal diggings of the division during the present summer, as there is an ample and constant supply of water for any number of sluicing parties, and from all I can ascertain the prospects are pretty good. There are 75 men at work there now, and it is ex pected that this number of miners will be doubled within the present month. It is currently reported that some persons in Melbourne are about to take up extended claims on Hoddle's Creek and work them by hired labor, with the most efficient washing machinery that can be procured. It is to be hoped that these speculations will turn out well, as they will be the means of opening up the extensive tract of country lying near the Dividing Range, where I am of opinion there are numerous highly auriferous gullies near the junction of the schistose rocks in that direction with the granite. Some good varieties of building stone could be obtained between Hoddle's Creek and the Little Yarra if a track were opened along the principal spur from the Dividing Range, and this can be done at a comparatively small ex pense. This track could be afterwards ex tended into Gipps Land via Mount Baw Baw, and would open up country of the most valu able description, both for agricultural and mining purposes, but which is now completely shut in by the almost impenetrable scrub by which it is covered. During the month of November the aggre gate operations in alluvial mining on the Caledonia gold field have not been more ex tensive than in the preceding month ; and were it not for a slight rush of about seventy men to some new ground on that part of the Back Creek, between Black Calf and Wild Dog gullies, this branch of mining would have been very dull indeed, as most of the alluvial miners continue to work on the old ground in the various gullies of this part of the division. Very soon, however, they will be compelled to try new ground and to prospect the extensive tracts of unopened country both on and sur rounding the Caledonia gold field : as, from there being now but little solid ground left in the old worked gullies, they must soon cease to yield any return for the labor expended. It seems unaccountable at the first view that men will continue working on ground that has been worked over and over again, when there are hundreds of square miles of ground con tiguous, as yet untried, having every indication of being highly auriferous, and which it is very reasonable to suppose would turn out to be as rich, if tried, as any portion of this gold field hitherto opened. But a few words will explain this circum stance. Some of the storekeepers here will not trust any digger a second week, if he goes to try new ground or to prospect. It suits their views better that the digger should remain working where it is known that there is a little gold to be got, for so long as he is able to make out as much gold as will pay for the supply of very inferior stores con sumed by him during the week, the storekeeper derives his revenue and is satisfied ; although the digger may not feel so at being, as it were, in a state of bondage, the tie being a dread of his credit being stopped, of which he is frequently reminded by the storekeeper. On the other hand, if a rush occurs to ground known to be auriferous, the storekeepers are obliged to rash there too, thus upsetting all their arrangements, and with a fair chance of very deservedly losing some if not all of his customers : and besides, there is the dread of competition, which in all probability he never would have to contend with in one of the out of-the-way worked out gullies, with a popula tion of twenty or thirty impoverished diggers, getting each from 3 to 5 dwt. of gold per week, every grain of which finds its way into the storekeeper's bag for goods of the very worst description at a profit varying from one to two hundred per cent., so that the poor digger who gets thoroughly into the hands of such persons has small chance of raising as much money as will enable him either to prospect new ground in his own immediate neighborhood or remove to some more pro mising locality. I have great pleasure in being able to report some improvement in the state of quartz mining in this division during the past month, and that the quartz miners are beginning to avail themselves of the excellent mining ma chinery both at Anderson's Creek and Salter's Rush, on the Caledonia gold field. At the first mentioned place 63 tons of quartz from various reefs in that locality have been crushed during the month of November, and although the yield has not been large in any case (see tables) I am informed that it will pay. The combination of a set of eight stampers with Wilkinson's patent calcining process seems to me to be a success, so far as reducing the quartz with a small amount of steam power. Messrs. Hewett and Whitehair have now machinery of this description at Anderson's Creek, and I am happy to be able to state that the results are highly satisfactory. The arrangements for saving the gold can"], [545, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS\u2014 NOVEMBER. 517 hardly be excelled, and is as follows : \u2014 First, the crushed quartz has to pass over three quicksilver ripples, about fifteen inches apart, it then drops down into two quicksilver ripples with a fall of six inches into each which causes the crushed quartz to sink well into the quick silver, where it deposits the gold. After passing these two ripples it has then to pass over about three feet of copper plate, at the lower end of which is the sixth ripple. Finally it has to pass over six feet of blanket, thus putting it bevond the range of possibility to lose either gold or quicksilver. It only requires now a sufficient number of quartz miners to keep the mills constantly going, the results would then be more satisfactory to both millowners and miners.

Raglan Division. (John Usher, jun., Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The parties engaged in sluicing continue to reap liberal returns, wherever they have a suf ficient water supply, and sufficient fall for the tailings. Sluicing and puddling constitute the safest investments for the small capitalist of any mining operations in the division. In the Waterloo section of the division, at Wingfield's GuUy, the Golden Gate Company have not yet reached the gutter : they are driving in the reef at a much deeper level than their neighbors, and in an opposite direction ; they have not much water to contend with, but their operations are much retarded by large seams of quartz running across the course of the drive. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Great Extended Company obtained 26 oz. 8 dwt. 6 gr. of gold from eight machines during the last fortnight. They have made application to the warden for 30 acres. The claim above that of the Extended Com pany, formerly occupied by Chinese, is now in possession of a party of Europeans, called the Lone Star Company. They are sinking a new shaft, and will bottom in a day or two. At Carpenter's Gully there is some indica tions of renewed activity; about 20 Europeans are profitably employed there. At Surface Point east the West of England Sluicing Company continue their operations with satisfactory results. At Eaglehawk and Jonathan's Gullies a very small European population are making very small returns, and there is but little pro bability of the re-occupation of these localities for mining purposes, unless for sluicing at the upper or store dams at the lower end of them. At Waterloo and Bill's Hills Rankin's party and the Waterloo Company are actively en gaged in ground sluicing; the water they use is brought down by race from a dam at the Black Swamp, nearly a mile square, and ele vated from the store dam to the upper fluming on the hill by means of steam power, and al together employs about twenty-five Europeans engaged in sluicing, and thirty Chinese engaged in puddling, most of whom are apparently making a fair return as they pay a rent for the water.

The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 13s 9d. to \u00a33 15s. 9d. per oz. The confidence ofthe mining and commercial classes in the remunerative and permanent character of the deep leads, although some what shaken by the poor results accruing from the large amount of labor and capital expended in search of a main lead on the lease blocks at Yam Holes Flat, is now restored by the steadily increasing returns from the Southern Cross and Garibaldi Leads, and the prospects recently obtained in the vicinity of Waterloo Flat. This change in public opinion is already leading to practical results in the formation of companies to prospect for lost leads at Red Streak, and at Ararat Flat.* At Trewalla Flat, between the old Poverty Point workings and the junction of Yam Holes and Waterloo Creeks, in a direct line between the Police Paddock, at Beaufort and the racecourse at Langi-kal-kal, At Paddy's Gully the Prince Alfred Com pany have had their operations much impeded by the slipping of the drift or quicksand from the roof of the drive (owing to bad lathing), in consequence of which the pumps became choked with sand which rose several sect up i | ***-. c H 9 9 a 2 o \u00ab \u00a9 \u25a0*= s Is Occupation.

It is highly probable that they will have to sink a new shaft as the readiest means of reaching the gutter, the estimated depth of which is 112 feet. The company consists of eighteen men ; they possess a good 12 horse power engine, with lifts, &c. They informed me that they had obtained a prospect of 2 dwt. to the tub at a depth of 109 feet. At New Musical Gully the Lady Franklin Company, who were working their claim with whim power, have been compelled to suspend operations last week through excess of water; up to that time they were realizing a good return. Perseverence, Patton's, and North Shicer Gullies are yielding a poor return to a poor population. At New King Charlie's, a prospect party has commenced operations at the end of the gully near the Black Swamp. Surface Knoll, Bagster's Swamp, Cosmo politan, and Long Gully North, are but very thinly occupied. Humbug aud Charlton's Leads received a small accession of population during the earlier part of the month, which has resulted in a slight increase in the yield of gold. Slaughter yard Hill and Sulky Flat are nearly depopu lated by the rush to the Lachlan, N.S W. At Raglan proper, on the Fiery Creek water shed, but little activity is exhibited, Duncan's and Old King Charlie's Gullies being entirely without a mining population, the former be cause it is worked out except some sluiceable ground at the shallow end, and the latter be cause the lead was swamped out long since, and can only be worked by expensive machi nery, as it is the deepest and wettest ground yet opened in the division. At Madman's Gnlly and Long Gully South, the few miners engaged there are earning fair wages, beside being occasionally rewarded by finding a nug get. Mitchell's Gully is completely exhausted, and might be used for the construction of a small reservoir for the convenience of the in habitants of Raglan township. diets supplied with water from the Ph\u0153nix Company's dam, continue operations with great vigor, and realise returns which have told favorably on the last escort. At Ballaarat Gully, Kewley and Company have commenced sluicing operations with a favorable result. At Old Musical Gully a small mining popu lation are doing well. At Tipperary Uully the puddlers are making improved returns, and a considerable number of Chinese are profitably employed near the supposed junction of this gully with the upper main lead. At Old Jonathan's Gully, the Wimmera sluicing company are doing well in the shallow ground on the southern side of the old workings. On the central portion of the main lead the only occupants are the proprietors of five whim claims, Chinese, who report favorably of their returns. The eastern tributaries, between Jonathan's and Charcoal, viz., Sawpit, Nuggety, Closes, and Annie's Leads, employ but a small popu lation of puddlers and tub and cradle men, and produce but a small revenue. At Charcoal Lead, the Whim Company are realising handsome average returns ; the weekly dividends however, vary from \u00a31 to \u00a37 10s. On the Lower Main Lead the Raglan Com pany are making an average return of 12 oz. weekly ; the party consists of eleven men, and they work at a disadvantage from not being numerous enough to keep on two shifts ; their washings range from 1 oz. a day from headings and debris got out in crossing old drives, to 4 oz. a day. obtained from maiden ground ; the majority of the party have been recently en gaged in sinking an air-shaft, and the com pany have just paid off some large arrears on their engine. They sluice the wash-dirt, of which the depth varies from 2 to 3 feet. A portion of the ground between this company's shaft and tneir boundary towards the Flying Buck Company's claim, has fallen in from the surface, close up to the engine house, so that they will probably have to sink two new shafts, one towards Charcoal Lead, the other towards the Buck Company's boundary in order to work with safety and advantage. The area of the claim will require ahout two years to work out with a party of sixteen men. The Flying Buck Company have recently broken through to gravel ; the level at which they were working last month proved too shallow. The prospect reported by their secre tary last month was not gold but brass. The Mai co Polo Company succeeded in reaching the gutter at a depth of 102 feet; the gold obtained from it only amounted to \u00a38 10s. per week amongst seventeen shareholders ; this circumstance, and the excess of water, caused them to suspend operations at the end of the month. 'Ihe Eastern Reef and main gutter The description of Madman's and Long Gullies, applies equally to Harrison and Ken nedy's Gullies, and Surface Hill West, neither of which hold out any inducement to any class of miners, except puddlers and sluicers. On (he Yam Holes, or Beaufort Creek water shed, Tucker Gully, the nearest to the Raglan Gap, although only occupied by a few puddlers, claims a passing notice as the site of Wimmera Company's reservoir ; it is fed by a race many miles in length, by which the water is brought across the Gap that divides Mount Cole from the Lanark Range, and the Ararat and Mary borough mining districts ; and is many feet higher than any other stored water in the division. At the Upper Main Lead and its shallow western tributaries, the various parties of pud-"], [548, "520 MINING SUEVEXOES' EEPOETS \u2014 NOVEMBEE. have been fully tested by this company, as they puddled all the wash-dirt and sluiced the headings, and foDowed the gravel in driving, instead of pursuing the absurd system now so much in vogue of driving in the reef and boring up for prospects. The Fiery Creek Company, on reaching the gutter, could not obtain more than 9 dwt. to the machine ; they did not cross the gutter, but weary of ten months' unrequited labor, sold their engine, &c , to the Homeward Bound Company for \u00a3630. On the Argyle Lead, the Chinese. Better- Late-than-Never, and Royal Oak Companies' claims are washing out from 6 to 12 oz. of gold from each machine-full of gravel. At Ararat Flat a prospecting party have just commenced operations, and have already provided themselves with a 6 horse-power engine. At German Hill, the Cockatoo Engine Tun- nelling and Sluicing Company have realised from 7 to 10 oz. weekly, but have suspended their operations in consequence of a paucity of water. At Reservoir Point, the Champion of the Seas Company are working on a skeleton lead, supposed to be derived from the Malakhoff Flat; it is evidently neither Jock's nor the Garibaldi, the best patches obtained not exceeding 9 dwt. to the load, or 1 oz. to the machine : total yield for the month, 22 oz. At Geelong Hat, a party lately set in just above the Red Patch, and are washing from 3 to 1 2 dwt. to the load, amongst which they got one piece weighing 3 dwt. The depth of the shaft is 20 feet. On Jock's Lead, the Shamrock and Thistle Company are getting but little gold, not from the inferior quality of the dirt, but because they get out so little of it, and do not understand their vocation.

Between Jenkinson's and Snake Gully a whim is erecting for the purpose of re-working the old ground. On Jenkinson's Lead a goodly number of Chinese are at work with tub and cradle. On McCooke's Lead the prospect claim has yielded a dividend of \u00a34 a man weekly. On the Red S-treak the prospecting party have obtained 1 dwt. to the tub from the stuff tested, with a great depth of wash-dirt. This is the only claim now at work in the Yam holes Flat from the Royal Oak to the Home ward Bound Claim. Crossing the range to Arden's, Dry bread, and Sailors' Leads, I find increasing activity prevails amongst both European and Chinese miners ; and judging from the quantity of stuff being washed, I believe that this locality is adding its fair share to the yield of the division. On the Southern Cross Lead, No. 6 South has a newly-sunk shaft with a whim and puddling machine erected. No. 5 and 4 amalgamated have just re-com menced washing. No. 3 ranges from 8 to 16 oz. in its weekly yields. No 2 ranges from 10 to 16 oz. weekly. 'Ihe Southern Cross Company's Claim pro duced 60 oz. during the month. The Royal Saxon Company have sunk a new shaft, and are likely to want a new engine, as the one they have in use does not seem able to drain the claim The Homeward Bound Company are ac tively engaged in the erection of an engine ; they ow-n the best and most complete plant in the division. Cost of engine, \u00a3630. At Cemetery Hill, the Steam Sluicing Com pany are getting well paid for their labor ; the weekly dividends range from \u00a32 10s. to \u00a36, exclusive of expenses and the interest of a loan on the engine. One (12th) share was sold for \u00a360. On the Ding dong or Cornish Lead the prospect claim is not yielding so well as usual. but the party are saving some rich cement, which they intend to burn and crash when they have worked out the claim. Sugarloaf Hill has only one occupant, and is only available for puddlers and sluicers. On the Garibaldi Lead, the Great Republic Claim, No. 3 North, has yielded 17 oz. from eight machines during the last fortnight. The company consists of fifteen men, but their en gine ( 1 0 horse power) is far too light, and some breakage is of constant recurrence, or they micht get out and wash nearly double the quantity of gravel that they are now doing. The Olive Branch Company's Claim, No. 2 North, has yielded about 3 oz. to the machine, or 60 oz. during the month, which gives but small dividends for an efficient party of twenty working shareholders. The Royal Standard Company (Claim No. 1) have obtained about 70 oz. during the month. The Garibaldi Company's Claim is giving but a small dividend at present, and a share (l-18th) is now in the market for \u00a360. At Poverty Point a prospecting party have gone through the usual preliminary operations.

Since the date of my last report little of interest in the process of mining has occurred in this division, indeed it may be said that the usual amount of time spent in holiday keeping at this time of the year, and which has been drawn upon to the full extent this season, has somewhat retarded the progress of operations, and, in consequence, the yield of gold to the several companies for the month is, except in cases of peculiar luck, rather lower than for previous months.

In taking a view of the progress of mining in this division for the past twelve months, and comparing this period with former years, there is nothing in the comparison to show either a falling off in the yield of the several deep leads, nor that the quantity of ground comprising these leads is likely to be exhausted for very many years to come. (P. C. Fitzpatrick, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The success of the Great Republic, Royal Saxon, and Hand-in-Hand Companies, Inker mann Lead, and Great Eastern Company, Mala khoff Lead, who have discovered rich tributaries to the main or trunk leads, go far to support the assertion, that the quantity of auriferous ground of which we have actual knowledge, is not on the decrease ; aud the quantity of gold obtained by these companies, together with the Cosmo politan, Koh-i-noor (only recently in gold) and Great Extended Companies, argues well in favor of the position that there is no falling off in the yield. The machinery is as follows : The quantity of gold obtained by these seve ral companies is as follows : \u2014 oz. dwt. gr.

The companies engaged in sinking operations, viz. : Durham, Suburban, Essex, Golden Fleece, and Garibaldi, are continuing their operations with the skill and energy necessary in the pro cess of deep lead mining.

Of the other portion of the district where shallow digging is the chief source of employ ment, I have nothing new to report.

With regard to alluvial mining, much cannot be said, as the greater part of the companies pursuing that avocation are at a standstill for want of water, and much of the ground that during the winter yielded fair average wages, is now held in reserve or abandoned for some other claim or gold field where water is more plentiful. to the want of sufficient capital to prosecute the requisite researches thoroughly may be attri buted the great number of undeveloped quartz reefs in this district. Other companies having obtained paying prospects from first trial c.ush ings without any further attempt to prospect the ground, immediately proceeded to erect machinery. The machinery was procured, partly on cash term, and partly on bills of exchange, payable in three or six months and bearing large interest, and after the lapse of three or six months when the bills became due the companies were perhaps unable to take them up, and the consequence was, that the machinery was sold in some instances at a price less than one-third of its value, and in some cases to its original owners who might have held a mortgage on the claim and plant. This has frequently occurred not only in my division but in the other divisions with which I am acquainted. The Black Hill Company have completed As regards quartz mining, the claims on which machinery is erected are with very few exceptions yielding exceedingly well, and 1 have no doubt that had the many companies who abandoned their claims after a very short and insufficient trial, adhered to them up to the present, they would have no cause to regret their perseverance. Every sort of mining re quires a certain amount of apprenticeship, and of the many who some time ago engaged in quartz mining, there were very few who pos sessed any practical knowledge.

Every part of the machinery appears to work well and satisfactorily, and from the care taken in its construction, and the strength of the materials used, I have no doubt of its being one of the most substantial and complete quartz mills in the colony. The company expect to be able to crush about 1000 tons of quartz per month. Their neighbors, the Independent Company, are still keeping the even tenor of their way, crushing about 250 tons of stone weekly and receiving the handsome average of from \u00a310 to \u00a315 per man, and their last seven days' crushing yielded \u00a3 1 7 per share, clear of all expenses. This company I believe work their mine more cheaply and with more economy than any company in the Ballaarat district. They have cut the hill across from the surface downwards, and have thus not only saved the expense of light and timber, but are enabled to remove the quartz from its bed with far more facility than if any other system were adopted. No. 3 Division. (Thomas Cowan, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as foUows : \u2014 The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The returns of the Majestic Company are less than usual through careless and in secure timbering in the underground workings. The ground fell from surface and destroyed all drives, tunnels, Sec, from the surface to the lowest level. This has compelled them to make an open cutting from the surface and to remove all debris which had been left in the drives. The annual holidays also have had a very great tendency to reduce the quantity of gold in this company's yield as well as in that of others. The Criterion Company, although working under many disadvantages, not the least being the poverty of their quartz, still persevere and struggle on manfully through all their difficulties ; but I hope they will be eventually rewarded for the labor and difficul ties which they have encountered. Total value of all mining plant in the division, \u00a3100,000. Number of square miles of alluvial ground which is being or may have been actually worked upon, 3J Number of distinct quartz reefs which have been actually proved to be auriferous to the present time, 6. The price of gold during the month in the division has been \u00a33 1 9s. per oz. In alluvial mining I have nothing new to report. Quartz mining is proceeding steadily, and there is a growing belief that this branch of industry will afford employment to a very large number of men, as it is now seen that with proper management, nearly every one of our lodes can be made to pay. The Wellingtonia Gigantea Company during the last month have crushed 1000 tons oi quartz from which they have obtained 230 oz. of gold, or an average of 4 dwt. 14 gr to the ton. The cost of raising the quartz from a lode 5 feet wide, at a depth of 1 00 feet, is estimated at \u00a3380 ; and the total cost of raising and crushing is stated by the company to be 8s. 7-|d , per ton. This will show that we have an immense field for the employment of labor, as a very small per centage of gold will be remunerative. The Try Again Quartz Mining Company On theBand of Hope Reef, on Little Bendigo, the companies actually crushing are obtaining very good yields. From 70 tons of quartz the Band of Hope Company obtained 116 ozs. 8 dwts. of gold, and the One-and-All Com pany obtain when crushed, a nearly similar return. The British United Company on the Sisters' Reef, are now engaged in sinking as they expect to find richer quartz at a lower level. The Red, White, and Blue Company have not yet completed the erection of their machinery. I have been unable to obtain any information from the Wellington Company, but I am led to believe they are progressing very favorably. I have been unable to send this report within the limited time as some of the companies had not completed their fort nightly cleaning until Saturday, and I was compelled to wait for the information until this day.

The Canadian Company obtained some good quartz not long ago, but the run of stone has been worked out. Their crushings latterly have fallen to the original average, namely about 2 dwt per ton. The South Canadian Company have been doing better since they resumed operations. The last crushings have yielded about 3 dwt. per ton. This company have been engaged in puddling operations, but it was well known that many specimens were obtained from the quartz boulders found in the alluvium. It was also known that a company on the Black Hill had successfully crushed surface quartz and boulders, and the Glasgow Company therefore concluded that they could do the \"same with equal profit. They accordingly erected a battery of eight stamps, and after crushing during the first fortnight between 70 and 80 tons of quartz, they obtained only 8 dwt, of gold as the result of their labors. Not however discouraged entirely they crushed 40 tons of quartz and obtained 3 dwt. 10 gr. ; this was enough to stop further operations, and the machinery is now lying idle. The Chinese Quartz Company (Hon Sen and party), which I mentioned in a former report, have been unsuccessful, and are about selling their plant and claim. The folly of erecting machines without making a thorough trial of the stone to be operated on, has been latterly shown by the Glasgow Company on the White Flat. This failure is one among many that have been caused through the want of proper prospecting operations before the expense of machinery was incurred.

Deep Leads. \u2014 Frenchman's and White Horse. \u2014The Red Jacket Company have obtained 657 oz. of gold from eleven machines of stuff washed during the month, the highest yield per machine being 176 oz. and the lowest 13 oz. This company have reached their western boundary, near which the 176 oz. nugget was obtained, and are now engaged working or blocking backwards towards the shaft, and expect some five or six months' profitable em ployment ere their claim is finished. Prospect Lead. \u2014 The Alston and Weardale Company now think they have sunk too deep for the gutter, and are presently engaged boring upwards in the reef at a distance of 400 feet from the shaft in quest of it; but, as yet, have found no satisfactory clue to its whereabouts or course. Black Lead. \u2014 The Scottish and Cornish Company have recently unwatered their claim, and are presently engaged cleaning out the drives preparatory to the commencing of effec tive work. This company have perhaps the most complete and substantial plant in the district, and upon the whole I would say their prospects are very good, though up to the present shares have not been much sought after. The Nelson Company, ahead of the Red Jacket, have also been doing very well of late, the average yield obtained during the month has been about 50 oz. to the machine, with about six feet in height of wash stuff The dividend for the first fortnight was \u00a330 per eighty-fourth share ; but in consequence of the late holidays it has been only \u00a3 18 for the latter fortnight. Shares in this company are in high demand and looking upwards, the present price is about \u00a3750, and considering the excellent prospects of the company, this price would appear moderate. Whim Holes, Little Hard Hills, &c\u2014 There is nothing new to report of this locality, the few old ground claims occupied continue to yield about tolerable wages. The Working Miners' Company, in advance of the Nelson, are just about opening out for the gutter, at a depth of some 415 feet from the surface, and judging from present indica tions it is likely they will not have far to drive before reaching it. Shares in this company are presently quoted at \u00a31100, the highest price, I believe, ever given in any company before gold was struck ; but so favorable are the general prospects that shareholders are not disposed to sell even at this figure. Pinehgut, Break o'Day, Spring Creek, &c. \u2014 Matters in these localities are presently rather dull ; a few companies, however, here and there are making pretty good wages, which is also the case with some one or two companies at Kangaroo Gully and Mount Misery, but no company is making anything deserving of particular notice. Bull Dog Hill. \u2014 There has been of late a considerable falling off in the yield of gold here though there appears little or no diminu tion in the population. A prospecting claim has been lately taken up to the eastward of the old workings by the creek side, and, I am told satisfactory prospects obtained, but the place is so patchy that the old hands or those best acquainted with the ground continue doubtful as to final results. The Defiance Company have not as yet pro perly got into their new gutter in consequence of their drive being (as is now ascertained) some 30 feet too shallow ; they are, however. presently engaged laying down an incline, by which they expect to reach the deep ground in two or three weeks. The stuff met with high up on the reef yields about eight oz. to the machine, from which it is thought the deep ground will yield much better. Quartz Reefs. \u2014 Staffordshire Reef. \u2014 The yield of gold obtained from the reef during the month, as appears by the accompanying tables, is rather above the average, whilst the quantity of stone crushed, owing to the intervention of the holidays, is smaller than usual. Cobbler's. \u2014 The Camp Company divided as much as \u00a370 per man for the first fortnight of December ; but owing to the late holidays and also to a breakage of a portion of their machi nery they have not been at work during the latter part of the month. Penrose Reef, Moonlight. \u2014 The prospectors are busy with the erection of their crushing plant, which they expect to have completed about the middle of February next. The Prince of Wales Company are still en gaged putting in a level for the gutter which they soon expect to reach, the length presently from the shaft is upwards of 500 feet, and if once fairly into gold, shares in this company will, no doubt, command high prices, as the The Great Eastern Company's plant is still idle, but I understand the company are making preparations for a fresh start, B"], [558, "528 MINING STJBYEYOBS' EEPOETS \u2014 DECEMBEB.

Quartz Mining. \u2014 The Imperial Company, Hiscock's Reef, has reduced about 600 tons of stone during the month (which is about 100 tons short of the usual quantity, consequent on the Christmas holidays), yielding 140 oz. of gold. The Standard Company has crushed 450 tons of quartz, yielding about 119 oz. The British Empire Company, north of the Imperial Company, has struck some quartz leaders west of their shaft, at a depth of 1 20 feet ; hopes are now entertained that the main reef is near at hand. The Oneand-All Company has also been keeping the Christmas holidays, consequently has not crushed as much stone as usual ; the 700 tons crushed gives an average of about i dwt. The All Nations Company, Magpie, crushed about 200 tons of quartz, yielding about 7 dwt. per ton ; this company has only been crushing for a fortnight during the month. The Triune Company, Scandinavian Reef, has crushed about 800 tons, yielding 2 dwt. 12 gr. per ton. The New Perseverance Company, White Horse, has been doing somewhat better this month, having realized 121 oz. from 600 tons of stone.

The Undaunted has been stopped, the engine was too small, and as they require more powerful machinery, and to sink a new shaft, 1 am told the greater number of the shareholders are leaving. The remaining few, who are taking the affairs of the company in hand, are about applying for a lease of the ground. I have not got the return from the Carngham Reef as to the quantity crushed ; I have been promised it by the manager, but it has not arrived up to date. In Smythesdale and Scarsdale mining matters seem to be improving, but I regret to say that at Linton and Lucky Woman's, with but few exceptional cases, they appear to be declining. Neither the Washington, Scarsdale, nor the Guy Fawkes Companies have got any gold yet, but in all likelihood will very soon, as their works are in a very forward state. The Cr\u0153sus are getting very well paid, the general average being about \u00a35 each per week. The Golden Gate about the same. The Smythe's and Browne's Junction is doing well, 720 fathoms superficial of wash-dirt lately produced 1450 ozs. The Bute is doing equally as well. The Scarsdale and German have bottomed ; they found gold in the shaft. There is a doubt as to whether they are on the Main Trunk or not, some supposing that they are on the Oldham Lead. At Smythesdale the chief event in connection with mining affairs is the highly encouraging returns obtained from the German Reef Pros pecting Claim. They have had lately their third trial crushing, and the result has been such as no longer to leave a doubt respecting the richness of the reef. Near the surface the yield was 12 dwts. to the ton; the stone con tinued to improve downwards, when, as they reached a depth of 30 feet or thereabouts, it yielded 1 8 dwts. to the ton. The last crushing, which took place about the 20th December, turned out 184 ozs. to 104 tons, and the stone had been obtained from a depth of 60 feet ; the average width of the lode is about 3 feet, so that it appears to be increasing in width as well as in richness as it descends. The Mines Royal, next the German, is about to commence ; from this claim to Browne's fence the whole of the ground is taken up with the Gulf Stream and West Kelly frontage claims. On account of the prospect obtained by the Scarsdale and German Company, the ground below them extending to Brown's fence is highly prized. Work is about to be com menced there. Two or three other companies have sunk shafts north and south of the prospecting claim. No. 1 North, I am informed, has got a good prospect, but beyond the opening out of the drive they have not proceeded up to date. Some time ago, a prospect like the above would have been the signal for an extensive rush, but so many failures have occurred in this division in connection with quartz mining that no matter how encouraging a prospect may be now, parties will approach it with hesitation and misgiving. Another frontage claim, 2258 feet long, has been taken up during the month, between Clark's and Browne's private property. It is the last of the Crown lands on the Main Lead. The Reliance is giving about \u00a35 per man weekly, sometimes more ; the Red Hill and Old Mines Royal turning out poorly ; the Caledonia doing well. On the Township Flat at Smythesdale, the Old Pioneer is getting \u00a37 per week ; the Britannia as low as \u00a32 ; the Surprise are making wages ; the Perseverance and Star of Hope are getting excellent returns. The Hand-in-Hand have ceased working for some time back. The company, I am told, are going to enter into fresh arrangements. The yields from the Great Western fluctuate much more than from any other claim, being sometimes as low as \u00a32 and at other times \u00a310 or \u00a312. The prospecting party of the Red, White, and Blue have finished their claim. This claim has turned out more gold than any one of equal extent in the district ; I believe it turned out about \u00a31500 per man. The Grand Junction is very poor, sometimes as low as 30s. per week each man. A new run of gold has been discovered proceeding from the south base of Watson's HiU through the North Briton Flat ; there was a nugget weighing 2 oz. 18 dwt. found on the bottom of the shaft, the wash-dirt is 3 feet deep. The surfacing ground all around Smythe's and Browne's is taken up, and in many instances turning out better than the deep and expensive leads At the Black Hill the Lugar has struck into the gutter and washed out from the first machine 19 ozs Should the whole of their ground turn out like this sample their labor and expense, which has been considerable, has not been ill bestowed. The Lord John Russell has driven up to the boundary of the Lugar The Bridge End Party, on the junction of Browne's and Contest Leads, re-working the old ground, are beginning to get paying wash dirt. The Oriental, next them, are not paying expenses yet.

The Lancashire Reef will, in all probabihty; soon revive ; McCauly and party crushed lately 300 tons, which averaged 14 dwt to the ton at a depth of 100 feet. Dr. Griffiths, too, has struck the reef, and has taken up a fresh claim. On the shallow gully at the foot of the reef is situated the old prospecting claim known as Patterson's claim ; its extent is 250 feet square, and the depth does not exceed 1 0 feet in any part of it ; it was granted better than two years ago to Patterson and his mate, and it has yielded up to the present time nearly .\u00a33000. It is now fast drawing to a close, but its paying quality has in nowise diminished, as may be seen from the latest weekly dividend, namely, \u00a345 for three men. It may not be unworthy of remark that, notwithstanding the richness of this claim, nothing payable has been found at either side of it, although the ground was thoroughly searched; but in this district isolated patches are matters of very common occurrence. The United Miners and the Prince of Wales are the only claims working now in Monkey Gully; they are giving moderate wages. On Italian's the White Star and All Nations are paying better than wages. The Whim Hole, on the Cumberland Lead, is turning out from \u00a35 to \u00a36 each weekly. The Emeu, Star of the North, and Prince of Wales, are doing but very little. The Perseverance Company have obtained a very encouraging prospect. The Waterloo and Cambrian are doing better 1 than usual; the former got 15 oz. trom a machine a few days ago, but this is an ex- ceptional case, as the average produce is about 6 oz. in both claims. The Cambrian have driven up to Browne's Vale fence, where they met the drives of the Browne's Vale Company. The first crushing from Captain Finn's reef has not answered expectations. Linton, Lucky Woman's, &c. \u2014 Since the period preceding the discovery of the Standard Lead, two and a-half years ago, so great a degree of stagnation as prevails at the present time has not been experienced in this part of the district. The partial suspension of mining operations, in many cases through the non- payment of calls, due principally from absentee shareholders who have been attracted to the New Zealand gold fields and other localities, and the difficulty of dispossessing the defaulters The Edinburgh claim continues to sustain its former average. The Britannia and Time -will -Tell are dividing from \u00a38 to \u00a310 each weekly. The Prince of Wales and Wilie and Com pany, on Pembroke Gully, are getting \u00a33 a week. The Glamorgan and Redan Company are getting very little. The Golden Age, on the Old Black Lead, have been getting \u00a35 a week for a few weeks back ; the Duke of Cornwall and John Bull from \u00a33 to \u00a34 weekly. The Atlas has fallen off slightly from its usual average of 30 oz. per week. The Pioneer Company, in Linton Park, have after a long and unsuccessful struggle given up. They have expended, I am informed, about \u00a38000. This failure must be very disastrous to the affairs of the company, and will I apprehend have a very bad influence on the affairs of the locality generally, as a good many will no doubt lose confidence in the lead, which up to this claim paid well. At Lucky Woman's, the Menai Straits Com pany are still dividing an average of \u00a37 a man. The Ivanhoe has fallen lately, the dividends being as low as 30s. to 40s. per man. The Albion has ceased, not being able to get as much as would defray current expenses, and the whole of the subscribed capital being ex pended. A few of the workmen, with the sanction of the company, have started afresh with the view of further testing the ground, and have got 30s. a man for the last fortnight. The Don Juan have not got anything yet. It seems they are on the same run as the Albion : there is a wide spread wash extending through out both claims which is too wide to be good. The Golden Gate, Great Wonder, and Hit or-Miss Companies have suspended operations. The Lucky Company have been flooded out. The company has been re-organized, as the capital of the first company was expended. They are about to procure pumping machinery. The Robin Hood also have been flooded out, and are engaged in procuring pumping machinery."], [562, "532 MINING SUEVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 DECEMBEB.

The Centaur Company are 30 feet through the rock in their new shaft. The Result Company have had a crushing, the yield from which has given renewed en couragement for further trial, although, from various causes, the stone crushed is not re garded as a fair average of the lode, but below it. The North American are shifting their machinery to their new shaft, which is 100 feet through the rock. The Fairy Glen, next the British, is flooded out. Ceeswick Division.

The Lone Star Company, near Mount Erip, are constructing a tramway from their claim to the Spring Creek, where they have a puddling machine erected. Their wash-dirt is poor, about 6 dwt to the load. The Grand Junction have opened out a drive at a depth of 275 feet, and have driven about 20 feet northwards towards the deep ground. The next claim, the Victoria, are 90 feet deep in the rock, and flooded out. The Cleft-in-the-Rock are getting very well paid, their ordinary returns being now from \u00a36 to \u00a38 a man weekly. The Try Again have not started yet, but will in a few days The Grand Trunk have entered into a new contract for sinking the shaft 60 feet further, for the sum of \u00a3600; the shaft is 120 feet deep at present. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Several parties on Coffee Hill are engaged in constructing dams, reservoirs, and puddling machines : the operations there are very satis factory. At Dreamer's Hill a few parties are at work turning over the old ground ; one of these, Price and party, consisting of four men, crushed from four loads of cement 184 oz. of gold. The wash-dirt with which the cement is intermixed looks to be very rich. This hill has been long celebrated for the richness of some isolated patches like the present : it would appear as if there was no regular lead, as the paying ground cannot be traced continuing for anything like a considerable distance. Another party, McDonald and McDonald and Gibbs, obtained 63 oz. from fifteen loads of cement, the principal portion of which had been missed by previous occupiers of the claim by driving under it. It is the prevailing opinion now in reference to this hill that the whole of it from the surface downwards to the cement encrusted on the bottom would pay well-equipped puddling companies.

The Clark's Hill Crushing Company have a 10 horse-power engine nearly erected for the The Bald Hills is especially affected by this decision, in consequence two companies (the Eclipse, and St. Andrew's) have applied for leases for their claims ; and the Koh-i-noor, Bonnie Dundee, and Golden Gate companies, are now the subjects of litigation in different stages. The Sons of Justice have got all their machinery completed, and are now fully at work. The Homeward Bound Company, in consequence of being flooded out, have not keen at work during the month ; they have however commenced this week. The Young Sons of Justice are sinking their shaft hoping to get a supply of water to enable them to wash. The yield of the respective companies during the month is as follows : \u2014The Northern Lights Company, 8 men 3 weeks' work, 27 oz. 13 dwt.; the Prospecting Company, 8 men 2 weeks' work, 21 oz.; Alliance Company, 287 oz.; Garibaldi Company, 8 men, 59 oz ; Rise and Shine Company, 16 men 3 weeks' work, 90 oz ; the Better- Late- than-Never Company, 10 men, 129 oz.; the New Independent Company, one machine, 10 oz. 16 dwt.; the Golden Gate Name of Company.

During the month the company have expended \u00a31060 and employed 65 men. The New North Clunes Company are making arrangements for erecting the winding gear and fixing the pumps in the shaft. The prospects of this company are much improved by the increased yield from the reef in the Victoria Company's claim as it approaches to the boun dary of the New North Clunes Company's ground. In the Clunes portion of the division some of the companies are making extensive altera tions in their machinery ; also, the Criterion Company have been experimenting on their tailings with Hinck's patent amalgamator, the result has been a yield of 2 dwt. per ton. The Friends of Freedom have suspended operations for the present. The Clunes Company have commenced to sink their main shaft to a proposed depth of 600 feet ; it is now down 310 feet, and the pre sent sinking is through a kind of soft green slate. The quartz crushed during the month has been raised from 156 to 230 feet in depth. Gordon Division. (J. B. Cusack, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Yankee Company have been idle during two weeks making repairs and improvements in their machinery ; the company refuse to give any information with respect either to the quantity of the stone crushed or its yield. The Alliance Company have put in a cross cut at a depth of 235 feet, going 120 feet east and 70 feet west of their shaft, the quartz reefs have been cut, supposed to be the Eastern Reef, 2 feet wide, the Old Man's Reef, 6 feet wide, and Robinson's Reef, 16 feet wide. A sample from the Old Man's Reef has been tried, and a prospect of 5 dwt. 3 gr. obtained ; the company expect to commence crushing next week. The Criterion Company. \u2014 In consequence of the absence of the secretary of this company in Melbourne, I am unable to give any returns of work done during the month ; the boiler of the crushing engine has been taken down and a steam dome put on it; the battery is also undergoing a thorough repair. The company have also let a contract to sink their shaft at \u00a311 10s. per foot, and notwithstanding this extraordinary price two different parties have after a trial given it up. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 The Clunes United Company have, in con sequence of erecting new crushing plant, not crushed any stone during the month, they are putting up a 45 horse-power engine for pumping and winding, and they also intend erecting a new battery ; the estimated cost of the additions and alterations is \u00a32370. The manager re ports that the quantity of stone raised and crushed during the quarter, viz.. from the 28th September to the 28th December, ' has been 711 tons and yielding an average of 12 dwt. 15 gr. per ton. The company have also let a contract for sinking their shaft to a depth of 300 feet, and the contractors have at 2 1 5 feet struck the Old Man's Reef, in the casing of which gold is plainly to be seen.

By the aid of a horse whim they lowered the water to a depth of 1 40 feet, when they opened out, and drove 36 feet west from the shaft; at feet and 180 feet ; the thickness of the reef varies from nine inches to three feet. The Homeward Bound Company have suspended work, and are about re-forming the company. Mount Egerton. \u2014 Scott and Company, Little Hill, have had 30 tons crushed, which yielded 30^ oz., quartz taken from old blocks at a depth of 140 feet ; they are driving west expecting to find another parallel reef; they are now 30 feet in, and continue to cut numerous small leaders from one inch to three inches thick ; the rock is getting harder and more sandy, the soft clay slate disappearing. this distance they found the reef and drove into it five feet, but from the increased quantity of water which they got on penetrating it, they were compelled to give up work until they procure machinery, so that it is not yet known how thick the reef is at this depth ; they found gold in the five feet through which they drove. Alliance Company, Parker's Reef, com menced crushing this month, but owing to various small alterations which the machinery required, they had many stoppings. They put through 60 tons of refuse quartz and slate that lay on the surface of the old workings, which yielded 2\\ dwt. per ton. They have now about 300 tons of quartz on the surface ready for crushing, and are raising from a depth of 155 feet \u2014 the reef is three feet thick. They are also constructing a tramway over the extent of the ground for the purpose of con veying to their machinery several large quantities of old refuse stuff which they believe wiU pay well for crushing. Big Hill Reef.\u2014 The Egerton Company have not been working their south end claims, they are about to secure all the underground which is very much shook through neglect of not having timbered ; on the north end they have taken out 750 tons, from 80 feet deep upwards, the reef at 80 feet is 16 feet wide, all of which is taken out. Alluvial. \u2014 All Nation's Gully. \u2014 Potter and Company (steam puddling company), have only made fourteen days' work during the month, owing to their water supply running short ; they washed 840 loads of stuff, which ave raged f dwt., per load ; the depth of surface which they take varies from three feet to nine feet There are a few alluvial miners working in this gully and the western gully, but their works are of the usual uninteresting nature.

The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 14s. 6d. to \u00a33 15s. per oz. During this month mining matters have been rather dull in this division. Many persons have been leaving for New Zealand, and on Dolly's Creek and the Tea-tree, operations are partially suspended owing to the scarcity of water ; the holidays, moreover, have had some influence on the returns of gold this month. The Sailors' Reef Company have purchased the entire plant, machinery, and lease of the Steiglitz Company's mine. I do not know whether it is the intention of the purchasers to remove the machinery to their own reef, or prospect the ground on which it stands further. The Perseverance Company have sold then lease, shaft, and other works. About \u00a33000 have been expended here, and the whole re alized the sum of \u00a360. I believe the workings are to be continued under the same manage ment : the proprietor, availing himself of some information derived from the drawings of this ground lately exhibited in Melbourne, intends carrying on the works on his own responsibility, Description. o 5 0 3 s s si \u2014 Pi Alluvial mining : \u2014 Steam engines employed in pumping and puddling Horse whims Horse puddling machines... 2 2 6 1 2 10 Quartz mining : \u2014 Steam engines employed in winding, pumping, and crushing Horse whims 170 Occupation.

The Steiglitz Company's works and lease have been sold this month. After squandering \u00a312,000, the whole tangible property and lease realized about \u00a3807. It would be advisable for the parties who have purchased to give this ground a fair trial by prospecting, as there is no doubt the ground is as good as any on Steiglitz, and in claim known as Davis's, at the north, and included in the lease, a reef 6 feet thick exists, which yielded at the lowest average J oz. per ton. The crushing mill be longing to the same company, and purchased by them originally for \u00a31300, fetched \u00a3100, and is now being removed by the proprietors of the Blackwood crushing machine, who bought it. They intend erecting a larger bat tery, and enlarging their works generally. have been poorer than usual. Some of the shares in the claim are for sale. The Redan claim is being worked vigor ously by three horse-whims, raising the mul lock at present stowed in the old workings. None of this has been crushed lately, but, judging from its appearance, will pay the pro prietors much better than that formerly crushed. The New Chum Company have been com paratively idle ; they were raising mullock at the beginning of the month, but discontinued owing to the holidays. A new reef, to which no name has yet been given, has been found near the Homeward Bound Reef. The specimens I have seen are good, although the gold is very fine. A new reef, called the Bird-in-Hand Reef, has been discovered near the alluvial sinking at Wallace's. It looks remarkably well, and will yield, I should imagine, from 6 to 7 oz. per ton. Some time since, in a drawing, I called your attention to the probability of good quartz reefs being found in this locality. The Morning Star Company, a co-operative enterprise, have also disposed of their lease, machinery, and crushing battery, by private contract for \u00a3700, after about \u00a32000 have been expended, besides eighteen months' labor of twenty shareholders. From the outset this com pany has met with a succession of mishaps and difficulties, and were moreover quite unac quainted with quartz mining, crushing, and gold collecting. There is no doubt now but that under the direction and management of the purchaser(the manager of the Albion Company) this ground will realize all that was anticipated. The claim known as the Allies was the richest on Steiglitz, as much as 49 oz. per ton being obtained; but the vein dips so quick north, and the difficulties of water have been so great, that the Morning Star Company were com pelled to give up working it. The greatest feature of excitement during the month in Steiglitz Proper is the alluvial I mentioned last month. With this report I forward drawing, sections, and description of it. The ground has been more generally re munerative than any alluvial ground yet worked on this field, and the sinking shallow and dry. During this month a prospecting association has been formed for the purpose of trying the district for quartz and alluvial deposits. I am not at present aware of any success attending the prospectors up to the present time, nor where the scene of their operations is. There is no doubt, if properly conducted, it will be of the greatest advantage to this place, as I know of no country which gives greater and more promising indications of both classes of mining, and which has been less prospected. By referring to the district map. it will be seen that very few reefs in the extent of five or six miles have been found out of one north and south line in the Steiglitz district. An examination of the country east, from external appearances, geological formation, and though last not least, the many rich specimens found, guarantees me in saying that I am of opinion that many rich reefs will yet be found if parties will step over their notions and prejudices of one and one only line of lodes. The Albion Company are progressing most satisfactorily, as usual, in their present work ings. The works some distance north on their ground, undertaken on tribute for the purpose of proving this portion, have been discontinued, the contractors declining to proceed, as the in dications did not give cause to anticipate re muneration. These works were on a vein known formerly as the Brilliant Vein, which is small and the ground very hard working. The Gibraltar Company have now aU their works in operation, and satisfactorily. They have raised about 50 tons of quartz from a poor block, formerly left as unremunerative ; these yielded 15 dwt. per ton, which meets all expenses. They are now working on some much more promising material, 25 tons of which are now at the Blackwood crushing machine. The great drawback in this vein is the large amount of sulphurets, antimony, tin, &c, it contains, which causes some difficulty in separating and collecting the gold. The Malakhoff Company, adjoining the above, have suspended their operations during the holidays ; their late crushings are supposed to While the yield of alluvial gold has mate rially increased from Steiglitz for the month, that for the Moorabool, Tea-tree, and Dolly's Creek, has considerably fallen. The emigra tion to New Zealand, which had subsided in the beginning of the month (many having re turned) has at the end of the. month revived through the whole of the field. On the Moora- C2"], [568, "538 MINING SUEVEYOES' EEPOETS \u2014 DECEMBEE. bool and Tea-tree this will be compensated for by the erection of some permanent and ex tensive works at present in operation, by which a large amount of labor will be saved, and the returns in all probability larger than hitherto. The Hit or Miss Company, on the Tea-tree, have had some fine returns lately, and the Perseverance Company, on the Amphitheatre, have nearly bottomed their reef, 300 feet, which has been unworked for some months; four horses with a whim are constantly at work. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Although this year has seen many changes on Steiglitz, and mining matters have been comparatively dull, machinery changing hands and leases being sold, given up, or cancelled, still the least sanguine look forward to the next year with better hopes of its prosperity. The field has been suffering a recovery from the effects of the many bubble companies started some time since ; public faith has been to a certain extent shaken in mining enter prise; and until this has been replaced by a more healthy system of working, we cannot expect confidence to be restored, and gold mining take its high and legitimate stand in Victoria. Total value of all mining plant in the division, \u00a322,000. Number of square miles of alluvial ground which is being or may have been actually worked upon, 16 J. Number of distinct quartz reefs which have been actually proved to be auriferous to the present time, 10. I do not look upon the sacrifices made at the sales of large and extensive mining plants as any indication of the falling off or uncer tainty of gold-mining enterprise. On the con trary, the fact of their being purchased for the purpose either of re-erection or for testing and working ground in a proper manner on this field, is a guarantee of ultimate permanency and good results. The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 1 5s. to \u00a33 1 6s. per oz. It will be seen by my report for this month that quartz mining at Blackwood has been all but a dead blank, and it is difficult to say when a change may take place. The stoppages, with few exceptions, all originate in one cause, want of funds \u2014 but how or where the requisite funds are to be procured appears to be problem no one seems to able to solve. Blackwood Division. (Thomas Hay, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 This is rather an unfortunate state of things and must produce serious results by its con tinuance. How long it may so continue is as yet a mystery. There is scarcely a mine in Blackwood which I could pronounce as pro perly and efficiently opened. I may say not one, but the eye of an experienced miner would detect faults. This, as I have already said, arises in most cases, perhaps, from want of funds, but in many instances evidently from want of mining skill in the direction and exe cution of the work, and in others, from de ficiency of both skill and capital, so that, on the whole, mining on Blackwood is at present in a very inefficient, unproductive, and ques tionable condition. From what I know of the available resources of Blackwood in auriferous quartz reefs, I can confidently assert that with mining skill and capital, unsparingly and judiciously applied, that the Blackwood gold field may soon be made to rank amongst the first in Victoria, Remarks. \u2014 There is another exodus taking place for New Zealand ; a few have left and others are preparing to leave.

There is again a revival of the exodus to New Zealand ; some have left and others are preparing to leave, which to some extent will affect the population remaining. Alluvial diggings are generally prosperous, many are making from \u00a36 to \u00a310 per week. This sort of mining, for it is mining, requires but little capital and less mining skill than quartz mining ; any one who can manage to use a pick and shovel wherewith to sink a hole a few feet deep, and is fortunate enough to find gold at the bottom, is a lucky digger, and fancies himself a miner to all intents and purposes, and after perhaps having saved up say a few hundred pounds, turns his view to quartz mining, never dreaming that this system of mining is widely different from his last pursuits, until he is forced to open his eyes to the fact that it not only requires a compari tively large amount of capital, but also a different method of working ; both of which are quite out of his power to provide. These sort of adventurers compose the majority of the quartz claim holders on Blackwood, and hence arises in a great measure the present stagnant condition of the mines. Only three parties on Simmons' Reef, have been doing anything, and those next to nothing. Two of these, the Cornish Company and Williams and Company, who crush with water power, are now at this season likely to do still less from want of water. The Pioneer Company have commenced pumping, and the others, Trewhella Brothers and Robin Hood Company, say they will soon make a start. The Caledonia Company, at Johnson's Reef, appear to have stopped for good ; they are about removing their engine to the Garibaldi Reef, to crush quartz at per ton. The lately discovered Atkin's Reef seems to promise well, having produced from the trial crushing If oz. gold to the ton of quartz. At Wilson's and the Garibaldi Reefs, the claim holders are struggling all they can to get quartz to meet the expected crushing.

The miners are beginning to find that the supply of water is rapidly decreasing, although, up to within the last three weeks, the supply has been comparatively abundant. In consequence of the heavy fall of rain on the 30th October (13.4 inches in the twenty four hours), many of the claims along Reid's Creek and the Woolshed have been swamped out, and several on the latter that paid good wages have as yet been unable to resume work. De Burg's claim, paying \u00a320 per man per week previously, is one of these ; they are getting np a 10 horse-power steam engine to keep the water down. A considerable number of the miners have left Reid's Creek for the Lachlan and New Zealand, and a few from the Woolshed and the other diggings.

The heavy floods during the latter portion of October and beginning of November, having caused serious damage to nearly all the creek claims in these divisions, the yield of gold has been very much reduced ; but parries having now completed their repairs and re-opened their claims, are vigorously prosecuting their labors of washing, and gold is coming in more plentifully. In alluvial mining I have to report the dis covery of what is likely to prove an extensive and remunerative gold field. The locality is situated on the left hand branch of the Little River, in two small creeks running into it. Operations are conducted by sluicing for which there is a plentiful supply of water. The average earnings as yet have not exceeded \u00a34 per week, but there is no doubt that the country on being opened up, will prove highly remune rative. The drawbacks are the extreme cold in winter, and the difficulty of procuring pro visions, both very trifling objections if the precious metal be abundant. Our quartz reefs seem likely to turn out well, as will be seen by the annexed report of the crushings. We are sadly in want of some enterprising capitalist to furnish machinery, there being only two crushing machines in the district, and both worked by water power, the scarcity of which renders them useless for half their time in the summer months. again. Although these gold fields have been declared to be worked out years ago, yet with the improved methods of working, there seems still sufficient gold left to remunerate the in dustrious miner; as an example, at Rocky Point in ground that to my own knowledge has been worked over twice, on the third working a party of four men took out (85 oz ) eighty-five ounces in one week (the week before Christmas), and the simple fact of \u00a32500 being offered and refused for one sluicing claim, proves that a highly remunerative field still exists in these divisions. Indigo Division. (Thomas E. Thornely, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 The lease on the Comiisino reef, taken up by Philippi, has been abandoned, and the ground taken up as ordinary claims. The Nine mile Reef (the Homeward Bound) crushed some stone which turned out very well. and as they go deeper the stone looks much better, the gold being very coarse. The dis covery of these reefs explains what has long puzzled a great many miners working on these creeks, viz., that in the Nine-mile and Yackandandah portion of the creek the gold should be so fine (like dust), while at Rocky Point (which is situated under these reefs) a part of the same creek and just between the two, the grains of gold could be counted, it was so coarse, as also being very pure. Should these reefs turn out as well as they prospected, it will give an impetus to quartz mining which will, I am confident, result in rendering it the most important feature in these districts, there being numerous reefs hitherto unworked and known to be auriferous, which are sure to be sunk on in case the others turn out well. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Total value of all mining plant included in the division, \u00a345,000. Number of square miles of alluvial ground which is being or may be actually worked upon, 45 Number of distinct quartz reefs which have been actually proved to be auriferous to the present time, at work only, about 6. The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 18s. to \u00a33 18s. 6d. per oz. The past year, on the whole, has been a most favorable one for the miner, as also most successful; some little stagnation has been caused from time to time by the report of new rushes and from the floods, but in the first case very few left these portions of the district per manently, most of those who left having re turned ; and in the second, a very short period of energetic labor sufficed to repair all damages and get the claims in thorough working order Occupation. oo 01 Pi c 3 9 S a 2 o 9 \u25a05 !\u00a7 II Jluvial miners luartz miners ither population 1,182 75 2,473 700 1,882 75 2,573 100 Totals 3,730 800 4,531 Description. 2 z < Si 9 Alluvial mining: \u2014 'ngines i'hims ships... 17 48 114 4 4 257 Quartz mining: \u2014 mgines )itto ... !ngines winding Vhim Phips 2 2 1 21 2i 11 1 2"], [573, "MINING SFBVETOES' EEPOETS DECEMBEB. 543 The following information has been obtained relative to the quantity of Quartz crushed during the month, and the Gold obtained therefrom : \u2014 Quartz reefing is all but at a standstill in consequence of the unsettled state of the diggings, though we have three leases granted, one of two acres (not taken up though granted last year), and two of three acres, each on Higgins's Reef (No. 5 plan, granted October and November) ; they have not yet any ma chinery at work. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 In so far as mining information for the last month it is merely a repetition for the five last months, in consequence of so many reports of rushes taking place to the lower diggings of this colony and New South Wales, which has so much unsettled our mining population. There are at Wahgunyah two or three leads from reports yielding very rich returns from their washing up for the Christmas through the little rain having fallen the last month. I have not heard of any persons being out prospecting for some time, as the reports from the various rumours seems to have unsettled the miners.

On the Pioneer Reef the quartz is giving a most satisfactory return. Messrs. Wallace and Company's machine is now constantly at work, and as there are probably several thousand tons of payable stone in their claim already dis covered, this company will keep constantly crushing. bank claims on the Buckland River, with the exception of two creek prospecting claims at the latter place, which have been taken up at the respective distances of six and twelve miles above any other workings. At this part of the river I am informed that very promising ground has been struck, and I have little doubt that a considerable amount of ground will be found payable on the Upper Buckland. The great want of the district is an increased population, as there are many miles of promising country totally unprospected. On the Pennyweight Reef, Messrs. Gitchell and Company have found another reef in their claim a short distance behind the one they have hitherto been working. It is a very large body of quartz, and from the appearance of the stone an improved yield may be anticipated. There is very little change observable in the aspect of quartz mining since my last report. There have been no additional discoveries, and but very few parties are now prospecting for new reefs. All the surplus population have left for either the Lachlan or the New Zealand gold fields, and those who remain (the number of which is given in the accompanying tables) are all profitably employed on the workings already discovered. On Brenkman's Reef, Ovens River, the machine to be worked by water power is nearly completed, and will commence working in the course of the next week.

The following information has been obtained relative to the quantity of Quartz crushed during the month, and the Gold obtained therefrom : \u2014 The above are the principal companies in my division, a correct return of the majority of the rest is very difficult to be got, and many of them keep no account themselves. Mining is at a very low ebb in Sandhurst at present, the miners seem quite unsettled with the conflicting reports from the various lately discovered gold fields, and operations are being carried on but with very unsteady appearance. Mining will never appear in the future so brisk as hitherto, as it is gradually merging into and becoming solely confined to the quartz workings, which is of a more settled and permanent and therefore of a more desi rable nature of gold workings. I may con fidently say that the half of our alluvial miners have departed for New Zealand, nor does the excitement to me appear half over ; still there are many who have done well over there and yet returned for good ; and I feel certain, that however successful the majority of the miners from Bendigo may be in New Zealand and else where, that the most of them will return being tied to the place, more or less, by the interest they hold in the quartz workings. Redan Reef. \u2014 This company, after being entirely resuscitated, has sprung again into new life, and with an entire change of directory and management, is proving to the public that the gold is there if properly searched for. The ground has been lying dormant for some time, and was being quite forgotten, however, last week they exhibited in Mr. Bannerman's win dow, a cake of upwards of 200 oz., the result of one week's crushing from the Comet Company. Several other claims on the line are now doing well, as are also some on the Sophia Reef, the next eastern parallel. The Hustler's Reef Company have had very good crushing lately, which has been the cause of their declaring a dividend, they will shortly be able to take up any quantity of stone; and it is a great pity that they have not machinery of their own.

No improvement in mining operations has taken place within the last month, and very little appears to have been done ; water is of course becoming scarcer than it was, espe cially in the outlying parts of the division, and the unsettled state of men's minds as to whether they shall stay here or rush to New Zealand, prevents many from settling steadily to work, on ground where certain wages are to be had, were it not for the attraction of new rushes. The tabular report gives the average yield of the principal workings in the division for the past month, and the other information required. Kilmore Division. (H. C. Campbell, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 In the alluvial there is but one case worthy of being recorded, and a strong hope is entertained that the long sought for deep lead, at the extremity of the Huntly Diggings, has been discovered. About three weeks since a party of miners having a claim situated at the extreme west of the lead, that is, in a bend of the Bendigo Creek, near McEwan's crushing ma chine, in working their old ground, brought up what appeared to be a tolerable wash-dirt ; it yielded on trial no less than two ounces to two dishfulls. A series of claims was of course immediately taken up, the result is not yet known ; it is, however, very probable, that the lead recrosses the creek somewhere about this spot. The Pottery Lead is not getting worse ; by force of baling with horse-whims and steam power, the great body of water is becoming exhausted, and the stratum of auriferous drift can now be approached in most claims ; the yield is about the usual average, half an ounce to the load. Two ounces to the load, though sometimes attained, is a quantity of rare oc currence. The surfacing system of mining, so universal in the Whipstick, has now entirely stopped, as no water is to be had. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 On the reefs, about the usual amount of work, and the average yield of gold still con tinue.

It consists of three stamps and a pair of Chilian wheels, driven by an engine of 1 5 horse-power, the same engine also driving the machinery attached to the sawmill. The charge for crushing at this mill is 20s. per ton. I trust, however, that some change will soon be wrought, as attention is being attracted to this place. Some of the Ballaarat miners have sent some of their party over to inspect the mines, and should they prove successful, they will be but the pioneers of a large portion of the Ballaarat miners, and the resources of this vast gold field will be properly investigated and developed. Costerfield. \u2014 This place presents a most desolate appearance, but three claims being at work. The carrying out of the proposed water supply, as sanctioned by the Government, will also give an impetus to mining in both the quartz and alluvial branches. Want of funds, want of machinery, want of water, and want of mining knowledge have led to this result. The reefs still continue as productive as formerly, but the causes above stated have led to their being placed under protection, which in all such cases means abandonment. The position of the reservoir, completely commanding as it will the whole of the old Mclvor gold field, and all the untried ranges and gullies extending for miles around Heathcote. will no doubt induce speculation in sluicing and puddling, and thus afford the means of livelihood to many now laboring under difficulty and want. The prospecting claim of Messrs. Coster, Field, and Company continues to yield well ; but little antimony is. however, raised just now. Murray's Claim on Murray's Reef yielded at the last crushing 1 oz. 6 dwt. to the ton. \u00a3125 was given by one of uur local merchants for 25 tons of the mineral without any admixture of quartz. At present, unfortunately, the absence of all water is the cause of great portions of aurife rous ground being thrown up. The puddlers, unable to continue operations, register their puddling machines and go elsewhere to try their fortunes, and in many instances never return. The Happy-go-Lucky claim of Messrs. .Morris and Stewart, on the Shamrock Reef, is as productive as ever, 1 5 tons crushed yielded 1 0 oz. to the ton. The Mclvor Caledonia Company, Caledo nian Gully, have crushed 5 1 tons of stone from their reef; the yield was 152 oz. 10 dwt.; the depth at which the stone was obtained, 239 feet. In spite, however, of these facts, and the well-known richness of the mines in that locality, I fear that unless a water supply be speedily provided, and machinery shortly erected, the whole place must and will be abandoned. The Cosmopolitan Company, Argyle Gully, from 41 tons obtained 38 oz., at a depth of 120 feet. Redcastle \u2014 The reefs here always maintain a good name for gold productiveness, still a great many of them have been abandoned, or what amounts to the same thing, protected. Eleven and a half tons of stone from the Balmoral claim yielded 13 oz. within the last last week ; however, this claim has been placed under protection as not payable. Two prospecting claims have been taken up during the month. Five tons of refuse quartz and sandstone from the Long Gully Company's claim, Long Gully, gave 5 oz. This company are about to sink another shaft for the better working of their claim. Many of the reefs are now being worked on tribute, and are paying well. Seven men within the last three weeks pro duced 73 oz. 10 dwt. of gold out of a reef 18 inches thick, and the place is generally im proving. The Independent Company, on the Hard-up Reef, have tried 1 3 tons ; the yield was only 4 oz. Waranga Division. \u2014 Whroo \u2014 This is the most productive of the Goulburn gold fields ; the reefs are rich, and the alluvial workings payable, and extend over a large area of ground. A trial crushing of 20 tons of cement, taken from Messrs. Gorski and Husfeldt's claim, Surface Hill, gave 7 dw-t. to the ton. A prospecting claim has been taken up on the Carolina Reef, at the head of Argyle Gully. The large cement fields are turning out very good, and the working of them is very simple and inexpensive.

This cement appears to extend a long distance, and to promise good yields. The cement on the Mclvor Road and at Fontainbleau, is very payable, and maintains a busy population.

The most of the mining machinery in the locality is, however, kept constantly employed, and remunerative returns have been obtained from the majority of the crushings ; and in the alluvial, in several portions of the division, indications have been unusually favorable. About the middleof the month a patch of good surfacing ground was accidently discovered on Arent's Hill, near Havelock, by a person who in passing over the ground observed a speck of gold, which on being uncovered, proved to be a waterworn specimen of gold and quartz, weighing 4 J oz,, also near it, another weighing nearly 6 oz.

The erection of a new quartz-crushing machine (75 horse-power) is rapidly progressing ; and a lively interest is felt in the success of those who have recently secured extended claims on the flat, and who have been actively employed in trying to strike the run discovered by the Hit or Miss Company.

The attention of capitalists has been withdrawn from it for the time being owing to Rocky Flat Lead holding out superior induce ments for the investment of capital. The following is the number of tons of Cement crushed during the month : \u2014 The Black Ball Company found it quite impossible to bottom the deep ground with their horse whim, and therefore have got their claim registered for a period of three months, to allow them time to procure steam machinery. Campbell and Company up to the present, have proved the lead to be a width of 120 feet, and the auriferous earth taken a depth of 1 foot, will average 1 oz. to the load. As an instance of the large amount of water they have to contend with, I may mention that on Christmas day they were for a few hours idle, which necessitated four days and nights constant pumping with their 16 horse-power engine, before they reduced the water suffi ciently to allow of mining operations being resumed. Rowse and party are obtaining from J oz. to 1 oz. to the load ; they are working on the reef convenient to the deep ground. * Principally tailings. t Principally idle. Charge per ton for crushing quartz, from 13s. to 15s. Charge per ton for crashing cement, from 9s. to 12s. I have the honor to report that mining matters generally have been in rather an unsettled state during the present month, which is principally attributable to the New Zealand and Lachlan rushes. These have had the effect of inducing a large number of resident miners, who have been for a long time earning from \u00a34 to \u00a35 per week each, and in some instances much higher than this, to sell their shares at a considerable sacrifice and hasten off to the new El Doradoes. The division would certainly have felt the effects of these rushes to a greater extent, had it not been, that in many instances the places of the departed were occupied by strangers from other divisions. Collier and party are getting from lj oz. to 2 oz. per load, with a fair depth of wash dirt. The United Britons have been dividing weekly for sometime from \u00a310to\u00a312per man ; the gold is generally of a coarse description, and they have often met with small nuggets weighing from \u00a3 oz. to 2\\ oz. Several claims in the shallow ground inside the fence of private property are yielding fair wages. On the Mia Mia Flat a few miners have been doing very well recently, several nuggets ranging from 2 oz. to 24 oz. in weight have been obtained, beside a large quantity of finer gold. The ground is of a patchy nature but when one is found it generally pays for the trouble attached to looking for it. On the Rocky Flat Lead, the majority of the claims are still yielding highly satisfactory returns, although the amount of gold obtained during the month is below the average, which may be accounted for from the unsettled state of the miners, and in a great degree to the Christmas holidays. Nos. 12 and 13 are obtaining from \u00a3 1 0 to \u00a3 1 2 per week, per man ; the Independent Company from \u00a36 to \u00a38 per week, per man ; Nos. 16 and 17 from \u00a38 to \u00a310 per week, per man ; Nos. 18 and 19 have been dividing, for the last four months, from \u00a34 to \u00a36 per week, per man ; and theConway Castle Company will soon be worked out; they have been obtaining gold for the last twelve months, and inform me that they have made \u00a3800 per man clear of all expenses. This claim was much easier worked than the majority of the frontage claims, being shallower and much drier, the gold apparently lodging on a high reef adjacent to the deep ground. The Liverpool Hill rush has of late become considerably reduced in numbers, many having gone to New Zealand and the Lachlan, still a reasonable share of gold is being obtained by those remaining, and I have little doubt but that it will afford remunerative employment to those now located there for a length of time. The sluicing companies are at present idle in consequence of a scarcity of water. Quartz Mining. \u2014 From the prospecting claim on the Mount Glasgow Reef 70 tons have been crushed, obtained at a depth of from 20 to 30 feet, which yielded 67 oz. 7 dwt. 12 gr. , or an average of 19 dwt. 6 gr. per ton. This has scarcely realized the expectation of the share holders, as they considered it would yield much better, however they say they can make good wages at this as the reef is from 2J to 3 feet wide.

(John S. Robertson, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows A reference to the tabulated information given above will show that the quartz reefs still continue to improve in the value of their yields, although owing to many circumstances, the intervention of the holidays included, the quan tities raised and crushed have been small. On the Slaughter-yard Reef, the main lode struck at a depth of 108 feet, still continues rich, 2J tons crushed at Nettleton's machine having'yielded at the rate of 25 oz. to the ton. From the Pyrenees Reef, No. 5 South, a first and trial crushing of 6 tons yielded the remu nerative return of 5 oz. to the ton. The share holders in this claim have preserved some large and beautiful specimens, which if crushed would doubtless have increased the average yield considerably. The machinery is as follows The Rasshoe, Lancashire, and Richmond and Gloucester Reefs, also continue to yield hand some returns, and I have no doubt but that the quartz mining will eventually prove the main stay and support of the mining population in this division of the district.

Number of square miles of alluvial ground which is being or may have been actually worked upon, 28. The rush which took place to Wisbeach Hill, about two miles from Kingower, has proved almost a failure, for with the exception of the nugget, 124 ounces, found by the prospector's (at a depth of 26 feet, and in the very centre of their shaft) hardly any gold has been found, although thoroughly prospected for a distance of over half a mile. Number of distinct quartz reefs which have been actually proved to be auriferous to the present time, 135. The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 15s. 3d. to \u00a33 16s. 6d. per oz. Our mining population has been still further reduced this month by the New Zealand re ports. Several miners who left shares and other property here, have left Otago for the purpose of disposing of their property and returning ; this circumstance has induced many who were wavering to decide upon going. The quartz reefs at Kingower remain much in the same state that they did last month, the machinery which it is proposed to put on the Union Reef for draining, not having as yet been erected. At Jericho a large quantity of quartz crushed by the Granite Company, very much disappointed the shareholders, yielding only a little over 2 dwts per ton. The lease party on the Frenchman's Reef, had a trial crushing of 15 tons which yielded 47 ounces 6 dwts. In many cases these men are shareholders in quartz claims, and as the bye-laws allow them to hold their claims in reserve (by regis tration) for three months, to be renewed for a further period of three months, it is quite cer tain that a good many of these will return, more especially (mentioned in my last) as some of the claims which in the early part of the rush had been abandoned, have proved very good. The whole of the claims on the Adelaide Reef are at a standstill, and this is in a great measure owing to the total absence in the bye-laws of any draining regulations. One claim can therefore refuse to assist the others in baling, and they (the claims who wish to bale) must either work for the obstinate claim as well as themselves, without any compensa tion, or register their claims. The quartz reefs in this division are yielding satisfactorily, and the adoption, in many in stances, of having the quartz raised by con tract, has given a more healthy tone to those miners working under that system, for not only is it invariably found to be a cheaper method, but gives greater satisfaction to those persons not actual miners, who may have invested in reefs. At Korong, the quartz reefs are doing nothing. Several patches of rich alluvial have however been struck during the month. Two men working about two miles apart, one on the east and the other on the west side of the town ship of Korong, found in shallow ground on the same dajr, the one 10 lbs. weight and the other 12 lbs. weight of gold in nuggets, none of which were less than 1 oz. Generally in deep sinking, and more partic ularly in quartz reefs, the miner cannot afford to work his claim until payable gold be found, without the assistance of the monied man ; and any system which will enable the capitalist to feel secure in his venture, and convince him his money is not wasted, will not only allow the miner to obtain money on easier terms, but will tend most materially to the development of our gold mines. St. Arnaud Division. (Charles H. Raven, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 A great drawback is felt up here in the in security and risk which shareholders in mines are subject to, unless personally represented by the owner ; for instance a person purchases a share in a quartz mine, and puts a working man in the claim to represent the same, if by that man's carelessness, inattention, or collusion with others, he allows the share to remain unworked for three days, that share, should any person post a notice on the claim for three days to that effect, is liable to be forfeited, although the purchaser and real owner may be away from the district, and had no notice served on him.

The machinery is as follows Some time since in my reports and otherwise. I endeavored to draw the attention of the miners in this division to the many quartz reefs untried and close to them, of the aurif erous nature of which I felt assured, and yet they steadfastly ignored these very places until Messrs. Fyfe \u2014 then Messrs. Sheeter and Com pany \u2014 after prospecting for months, have met their just reward. Unfortunately the great drawback for some time to the development of the district, was the distance from any crushing machine : the risk to be incurred by cartage and crushing so far away daunted many from trying here. But Messrs Fyfe and Company, with praise worthy energy at once stepped out of the path others had taken, started to work, and, as I before reported erected a very primitive kind of machine, as far as appearance went, but not so as to results. This machine, made and erected on the spot, something between a Pendulum and Collier's Titurator, crushed equal to the best from any foundry, and by its results estab lished the Greenock Reef, immediately followed by the Lancashire, Rose and Thistle, and Bachelors, all of which promise as favorably.

The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 10s. to \u00a33 19s. per oz. On the Greenock, I am informed a steam engine and machine will also be erected ; and nearer to St. Arnaud. on the Carapoer Creek, a 1 5 horse-power engine and crushing machine is nearly up. Six months ago scarcely a dozen men could be found near any of these reefs. Upon seeking information from lessee and it being refused nothing further can be done ; in many instances they will not afford infor mation as it would influence their standing in the market. The covenants of lease require the information to be furnished only once in six months. The Bachelors is supposed to be the con tinuation of the Greenock about halt' a mile south. Half a mile further south is a large reef continuous on the surface for three-fourths of a mile, and about fifteen feet thick; unlike nearly every other reef in the country, instead of striking below the surface either north or south with the fall of the range on its line of direction, it rises where it crosses the gullies, even higher above the surface than on the crown of the range. The quartz is of a fine mealy character, full of iron pyrites, copper, &c, and the sac simile of the run of quartz obtained on Bachelors and Greenock ranges. This is only one of the many opportunities which in this division almost beggingly present themselves to the unbelieving capitalist. A few months hence I may have to report of this as of others once looked doubtfully on in this division, now taken up, one yielding returns of 280 oz. of gold for nine days' work, and another waiting for its machinery to be erected to do the same. It is gratifying at the commencement of a new year to have to report everything in this division in the shape of mining in a more flourishing state than it has been for months, I may almost say ever has. Hitherto there has been but little doing in quartz reefs, except in the town of St Arnaud ; but now, the reefs around being well tried, are amply repaying those who had sufficient faith in their character and appearance to prospect It has long since seemed surprising to me that this portion of the division should be left wholly untried, more so, when I know of miners further south who persist in working where gold was, or anywhere near where it had been found, in preference to the chance of finding where it is, no matter what inducement may be held out to them whilst it is but theory, although they have confidence enough in you Description. \u25a0a I flj JB 9 fe gg aa Alluvial mining : \u2014 Puddling machines 30 26 Quartz mining : \u2014 Horizontal engines, crushing Vertical engines Horizontal engine, for feed- ing Vertical engine, pumping...

In this lease the reef has been struck 12 to 15 feet thick, yielding nearly 1 oz. per ton all through ; their last retorting giving 280 oz. for twelve days' work, a lot of rubbish occupying the first part of the week. Stuart's Hill. \u2014 I have again to report favor- ably of the silver productions of this hill, and can scarcely conceive the reason of so little attention being directed to this new discovery. Being at present worked in such a rough manner and with so much doubt, there is every proba- bility that unless some more capital or knowledge is brought to bear on it, in a short time it will be lost ; and yet this mine would pay handsomely to any who knew its peculiarities and the proper modus operandi. I saw last week 8 dwt washed from less than half dishful of dirt, partly gold and partly silver. The specimens of gold are rich ; the specimens of silver almost pure. From the quartz now crashing the result of 1 0 tons just cleaned up, from the table only, 275 oz. amalgam, the stamps not yet lifted.

Thompson Brothers, who have added a very simply constructed 5 horse-power engine to the Old Specimen Gully plant, for the purpose of draining the mine, thereby superseding the cumbersome machinery formerly used. In quartz mining the Ajax Company con tinues to give the best proof of increased yield in depth. The ground held by them was among the first opened as quartz workings. In connection with this claim the first steam engine brought into this district was erected by Ham and Company, who, however, failed to exact sufficient gold to pay expenses. Subse quently, several parties prospected it with variable success, the greatest failure being the late mismanaged Bolivia Company, whose plant was taken by the present company on tribute, under the style of the Ajax Company. They struck gold in June last, and to the present time \u2014 i. e , six months \u2014 they have driven a level 200 feet southwards along the lode, and raised and crushed 1460 tons of quartz, which has yielded 4530 oz., which realized, at market price, \u00a317,119 12s. 6d. On the same reef the Lady Barkly Company (late Sir Henry Barkly) have completed the removal and erection of their machinery, and their first cleaning up gave them 40 oz. of gold. Their machinery has been considerably improved. Among other things, they have introduced the paper pipes for pump, which, should they prove as serviceable as they are cheaply and expeditiously adapted for draining a mine, will be an immense improvement to cast iron.

At Pickpocket most of the ground is being worked by Chinese. The ground here is from 20 to 25 feet deep, the whole of which the Chinese turn over ; they, in fact, take a cover of from 1 8 to 22 feet of earth from the wash ing stuff. Notwithstanding the reappearance of the New Zealand fever, mining operations have been briskly carried on during the past month. Most of our puddlers have still sufficient water to carry on their usual work. It seems very strange, and almost incredible, perhaps, but the puddlers of this district are averaging considerably more than wages. The ground has been turned over and over again, and now the whole of the alluvium found in the gullies is being put through the puddling machines, and excellent wages is the result. There is no doubt but the present process will be continued until the whole of the known auriferous gullies will be entirely washed away in the shape of sludge, leaving nothing behind but the bare bed rock and sundry heaps of stones to show where the gold has been takeu from. One thing will be certain, that if the whole are worked out in this manner, little of our golden treasure will be wasted or allowed to lie dormant. The Chinese do not seem satisfied until they clean the whole of the gold-bearing earth from their claims, that not a particle of the precious ore may be left. The interpreter informs me that his country men are making excellent wages from this ground. This certainly seems most strange ; European companies, with the aid of pumping and washing machinery, became insolvent to a man in working the same ground. In quartz mining there is nothing new. Our companies at work are at present paying well. The Achilles (late El Dorado) Company are busily at work, and with much better success than attended their former efforts. As will be seen by the returns attached, 800 tons of quartz have been crushed, which has yielded 200 oz. of gold Sluicing operations are particularly brisk just now, as the rivers and creeks are low, and their beds can be worked with advantage. The Chinese portion of our population are principally engaged in this branch of mining. There is scarcely a bit of the River Loddon in this division but is in the hands of Chinese, and The Ferron's Reef Company is showing faint signs of improvement. It is to be hoped they will continue, as from the success of a Name of Company. Where Quartz was obtained. Quartz crushed. Average yield of Gold per ton. Remarks. C.

(Ambrose Johnson, Mining Surveyor ) The population is as follows : \u2014 The Vaughan Gold Mining Company are not making such profit as they have hitherto done, but are sanguine of success The Perseverance Company (Vaughan) are making considerably more than wages, and more perfectly satisfied with their prospects. Jenkins and Company, of Kangaroo, are making splendid wages. Odgers and Company have netted \u00a340 per man for the past month, certainly no bad result from debris and tailings which had been pronounced worthless. As the area of our alluvial deposits continues to decrease, it is certainly to be hoped that sufficient enterprise will be in existence to endeavor to develop our more lasting gold resources. It seems strange, and indeed it would be astonishing in any other country than golden Victoria, that so many hundreds of auriferous quartz lodes should be known to exist and allowed to stand untouched. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 In this division alone there are scores of quartz veins cropping out on surface, showing great strength in their formation, and not a stone has been broken from their surface. That vast mines of wealth lie beneath our feet I have not the slightest doubt, neither can any one who takes a common sense view of these matters. It seems to me that, as our rich alluvial fields must have been supplied from richer sources, those sources should not only be dis covered, but tested thoroughly. The great problem to be solved, and from which the country will gain the greatest pos sible good is, firstly, whether our quartz lodes continue to pierce the earth at great depths ; and secondly, if found at great depths, whether remuneratively auriferous at such depths. * Including one in course of erection. t Including four in course of erection. That they will continue in depth and be payable at great depths. I have not the sha dow of a doubt. But if it were a known fact that our reefs are auriferous at great depths, it would give an impetus to mining that it would never lose, and capital would be invested with the greatest confidence of ultimate success ; in fact, speculation would almost cease to exist, and investment take its place. On the other hand, should the contrary be proved, viz., that our reefs are not auriferous at great depths, then millions that might be ventured would be invested in other channels, from which good results would accrue.

Quartz Mining. \u2014 This branch of mining has not during the last month produced anything of more than ordinary interest, but the machines have been kept pretty generally employed, and the yield in most cases, although not brilliant, at least satisfactory. I have this month again in vain applied to the various machines crushing for hire, but cannot obtain any reliable infor mation, the respective parties apparently not feeling inclined to have their produce published. The only reason I can assign for this unwilling ness is the jealousy and fear of encroachment by adjoining parties, for, as far as I can learn, in most cases the yield has been rather above the average. I hope, however, by applying direct to the different parties, to obtain the information required Among the principal reefs at work in the Jim Crow Division I may mention \u2014 Melvin's Reef, head of Blind Creek. \u2014 This reef has lately again been occupied, and as far as I can learn the party prospecting have every faith in the whole bulk of the reef being pay able. Machinery on the ground will, however, be indispensable, and it will therefore be neces sary, before going to any extraordinary ex penses, to ascertain whether the gold continues for any depth; but, judging from appearances, I believe I may predict that this reef will ultimately become as important as any in the district. On the Stony Creek Range, dividing Long or Black Swamp from Blind Creek, several claims have lately been prospecting a seemingly well-proportioned quartz reef cropping out on the surface, and which, from the rich deposits worked on both sides of the range, both in the surface and adjoining gullies and flats, has gradually been getting into favor with the miners in the locality.

It is reported that the reef where intersected was about 16 feet wide, and that a trial crushing averaged 11 dwt. per ton, at that period not paying crushing and cartage expenses, but would now clear a handsome profit. A great portion of the tunnel has, however, to be cleared and re-timbered, and it will therefore take some time before any definite result is arrived at. This reef I consider to be on the Wombat Reef line The next claim north is immediately south of Smith's Creek, and occupied by the Argus Company, who are driving a tunnel from the level of the creek bed with a view of cutting the reef at a depth of some 70 feet, as also to intersect any existing leaders. On Wombat Reef, Wombat Hill, the Cornish party has principally been crushing for hire, and raising quartz from their old claim, tbat I have no doubt, will pay very liberal profits as usual. In fact, from what I have seen of the company and their system of working, I should be surprised if the reef could decline so much in value as to make it unpayable to the owners. The old crushing machine in Wombat Flat, belonging to the same company, has only been in working order for a couple of weeks and has during that time been fully employed crushing for hire. On St. George's Reef, Mauritzean's Reef, Imperatrice Eugene Reef, and SpriDg Creek Keef, parties are prospecting, but no crushing, as far as I can learn, has taken place during month. In dry diggings matters are looking very brisk, and quartz reefing has, during the last few months, been every week improving. Nearly all ground in that locality where gold is known to have been found formerly, in any even so small quantity, is now occupied, and has in some instances turned out almost beyond expectation. On Parker's Specimen Reef, the Prince Llewellyn Company, formerly known as the Dry Diggings Company, have now got their crushing plant in fair working order, and are busy timbering, clearing, and opening up the mine. The several heaps of refuse stuff left on the ground by former proprietors have been crushed, and as much as 8 to 12 dwt. per ton have been obtained, and with this and crushing for hire the machine has been kept fully employed. The next claim, north, the original prospect ing claim, now occupied by Messrs. Wilgoss and Company, is also turning out first-rate, averaging between 1 and 2 oz. per ton by a fair width of reef; and claim No. 2 North, where a leader some two months ago was discovered on the surface, is paying at the same rate. Farther north, on the same hill, a couple of claims have lately been taken up, but have not as yet struck anything definite. On Sportsman's Reef a crushing machine is in course of erection on the original prospecting claim, and the ground between this and the Prince Lewellyn Company's lease, on Parker's Specimen Reef, has been taken up during the last month. The Havelock Company, adjoining north, have hardly as yet got their claim and plant in fair working order, and from the small quantity of stone they have reduced no in ference as to their probable success can be drawn ; the company, however, is very san guine. The next party, Messrs Brown and Company, are as yet engaged driving their tunnel, and no crushing has taken place during the last month. Messrs. Greenfell and Company have ob tained permission of the municipal council to sink a shaft in Stanbridge street, and have commenced accordingly ; but from the underlie of the reef and dip of the gold I anticipate that a more than ordinary depth of sinking will be required. The reef in Messrs. Trimble and Company's private property, Camp street, as well as in the Fearnought Company's ground in the street, and in Carrol and Company's and Vickery and Company's paddocks, west of the street, is still keeping up to its usual standard, and the amount of quartz raised and gold produced during the last month from these mines, have been very considerable. On Union Reef a large area of ground is held in reserve by the shareholders in the last mentioned crushing machine, with a view of giving the reef a fair trial, as soon as the machine has commenced operations."], [597, "MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 DECEMBER. 567 On Adcock's or Terrible Reef, a party is about starting to prospect. On the first dis covery, some three years ago. a very good prospect was obtained in a surface leader, but could not be traced, and the reef has re peatedly been tried with a like result. claims are registered, and I have heard of no crushing during December. Hamburgh Keef, Homeward Bound, aud Great Reef, are all similarly situated, as also Welshman's Keef. On Pioneer Reef or Steel's Reef, the Pioneer Quartz Mining Company is busy at work, but I have no opportunity of obtaining information as to the company's proceedings. On Old Nuggety Reef, the Montblanc Com pany has not been able to discover any proper defined reef, although gold has been found in a number of leaders near the surface ; in fact, very rich specimens have now and again been discovered. The company is now driving a tunnel from the foot of the hill with a view of intersecting and prospecting any leaders or reefs existing in the hill. In Glengower, at the Deep Creek, the Boatswain's Reef has been registered for want of means to carry on prospecting. On Sardinian Reef. Messrs. Cooke and Com pany, and Stone and Company, are still perse vering, one of the shafts being down about 180 feet, and another has been driven about the same distance. On Beehive Reef the prospectors experience great difficulty in keying down the water, and I anticipate that steam machinery will erelong be introduced. The quartz raised looks first rate, and claims are now occupied both north and south of the prospectors. On Prince of Wales Reef, and Hartley's Reef, prospecting claims have also been taken up in the early part of December, but have not yet, as far as I know, struck anything payable. From Adams's new reef, head of German Gully, near Old Tom, I have heard no news of importance during December, with the exep tion of it being reported that claim No. 5 South had struck a very promising reef, but of this I am not certain In the claims where gold-bearing stone is being raised, the quartz is reported to keep up to the usual standard. On Oliver Cromwell's Reef, it is intended to erect machinery to be worked by water power, the distance from crushing machinery being a serious item in the working expenses. Puddling and Sluicing. \u2014 Owing to the fre quent showers in the beginning of the dry season, sluicing, at least of low ground, has not entirely ceased, and in most localities the puddlers have made ample provisions for storing a supply of water for the summer. Sluicing is not however, and has not for the last season, been of near so much importance as during the previous years ; although I have no doubt if a sufficient supply of water was at hand, the western gullies of the division, Cham pagne, Boots, and vicinity, would give very re munerative employment to a considerable population ; but along Sailors', Spring, and Jim Crow Creeks, nearly the whole of the sluicing is carried on by Chinese with only an excep tional party of Europeans. Puddling is as usual steadily progressing. and the proceeds as far as I can learn, everv way satisfactory, although nothing very bril liant may be expected, at least not as an every day occurrence. I have no doubt that not a few claims are pretty steadily paying upwards of \u00a33 or \u00a34 a week per man. a yield that at present times may be considered very good, but owners of such claims, as a rule, never make it known before the claim is worked out and publicity sure to cause no envy. The number of claims taken up during the last month, has not been so large as the pre ceding month, but the holidays in a great measure account therefor, and as to locality, no special gully or flat seems to be more favored than another. From Adelaide Reef, head of Don't Wak'em, I have heard of no crushing, and no change has taken place since my last report. In Yandoit no improvement in quartz mining can be reported ; the greater number of claims 'being registered, and in the yield of the few claims actually at work, no material change has occurred, as far as I can ascertain. On Hoggett's Reef, the Morning Star Com pany is busy fitting up a new steam-engine, intended to drive a battery of twelve heads of stamps, and will probably be ready to com mence active operations in the latter part of January or early in February. The company's new shaft is now down about 60 feet, and is reported to have struck gold, and from the richness of the stone taken out above water level, great things may be expected when the company gets fairly to work, the more so as the original prospecting claim is now included in the company's ground, and the object of the company is reduced to follow up the gold, in stead of prospecting for it below water-level at a considerable distance from a payable claim, which is always a disadvantage. On Old German Reef the Goldsmiths' Com pany is still dormant, the manager being the only person oil the ground connected with the company; but as soon as the re-organization of the company has been effected, operations will be resumed. On Trogish Reef, Messrs. Morrison and Company are working the prospecting claim, but with what result I have not heard. A quantity of refuse stuff left on the ground averaged about 4 dwt. per ton. On Glamorganshire Reef, the most of the o"], [598, "568 MINING SURVEYOES' REPORTS \u2014 DECEMBER. Crow and Yandoit, nothing has occurred to break the usual monotony, with the exception that in Yandoit matters have been if possible, more dull than usual. All the companies, Manchester, Grand Junction, Alpha and others, are at a standstill. Shicer's Gully and Hill, and Frenchman's Hill, being nearly the only localities presenting an appearance at all lively. In tunnelliDg no visible change has taken place during the last month, but I have no reason to think that the average yield has been less than usual. This branch of mining is mostly prosecuted by Italians, from whom it is very difficult to obtain any information, but their manner of working and the perseverance they exhibit, in often working for a couple of years, and upwards, without any returns, are deserving of all credit. No new ground has been opened during December, but several claims have been upon old abandoned ground, which has been found in most cases to pay very well for puddling. In alluvial sinking a couple of small gullies have been opened between the bottom of Black Jack's and Richardson's Gullies, but not of any extent so as to materially effect an im provement in this branch of mining. In the first opened, the prospectors got from 2 to 4 dwts. to the tub of pretty coarse gold, and in another claim a 17 dwt. nugget was found, but generally the claims are not paying much above wages. The depth of sinking is from 12 to 16 feet, and the formation similar to all the rest of the gullies in the neighborhood. The discovery of the second was only so lately re ported, that I have not yet visited the ground. Insignificant as these discoveries may be in themselves, they still greatly tend to encourage the prospecting of the many very promising looking gullies in that locality, and I have little doubt still important discoveries will be made in that quarter. In Blanket Flat no definite result has as yet been arrived at, but the company's operations are very much retarded by the amount of drift water. Taradale Division. (Thomas Turner, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 Remarks. \u2014 The division is in extent 40 by 30 miles and embraces several large towns. The machinery is as follows : \u2014 Whiskey Lead near Champagne Gully, is now nearly worked out ; in fact, the working is now limited to the taking out pillars left during the first rush. Although no great area of ground was found to be payable, still some 300 people averaged good wages, and even better for some three or four months, many of whom came from Creswick's, for Jim Crow does not contain a very great number of tub and cradle men. In Daylesford, the Township Lead is still paying handsomely in the claims not worked out. In the claim last bottomed, occupied by the Emerald Company, the average seems to be from 1 2 to 1 8 oz. to the machine ; a very good return when the company begins block ing out. The Wombat Hill Gold Mining Company in the Camp Reserve, are fitting up their steam engine, removed from the Pickpocket Com pany at Yandoit. Messrs.

Maldon Division. (R. Nankivell, Mining Surveyor.) The population is as follows : \u2014 A new patch of auriferous deposit has lately been discovered on the Back Creek one mile and a half south of Taradale, which seems to be a connecting link between the run of gold along the creek from ihe Ironstone Hill, and the lead at the Scorpion Hill. There remained here a remarkable space of vacant ground where the lead had apparently broken off ; but the new discovery having drawn together about one hundred miners, no doubt but a connection of the two runs of auriferous deposit will result, and probably some rich claims will be obtained. There has also been some little attraction by a discovery on the northern portion of the Malmsbury town reserve, a small run of gold having been found under a trap-rock hill on the east bank of the Coliban River ; but as the place is on a small point of land embraced by the river, the extent of available ground for claims is very limited. There ate about twenty miners on the spot. Remarks. \u2014 These returns are an approxima tion only, as the population is changing every week. The machinery is as follows :\u2014 On the Kangaroo Creek the rush of last month has very much declined ; there are only about twenty alluvial miners at the place. The Kangaroo Quartz Mining Company are erecting a 25 horse-power steam engine on the Kangaroo Creek, so that their efforts are at least assuming an earnest appearance of pro gression. Their dam has been well repaired, and they have a fine reservoir of water. About two and a half miles further south a new reef has been struck on the Kangaroo Creek. A prospector's privilege has been taken up, but the value of the reef has yet to be proved. These new discoveries have not been of sufficient attraction to draw off any number of miners from old workings. Total value of all mining plant in the division, \u00a380,000.

The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 15s. to \u00a33 15s. 6d. per oz. The decrease in the number of alluvial miners, both Europeans and Chinese, which is apparent during the month of December, indicates very distinctly that the older portions of these gold fields are worked to such a state that little remains to be done but to apply machinery and give them a final working, as the yield derived from tub and cradle washing has all but ceased to be remunerative. This state of things, as I have remarked in former reports, is not owing to the want of new alluvial ground on which to work, as there has been as yet but a small per centage of the area of these gold fields worked ; but because the alluvial miners here, content themselves with wishing for new ground to be opened instead of prospecting and opening it themselves. It is by no means unusual on these gold fields, to see diggers walking about for two-thirds of their time over old worked out gullies, looking for a chance patch of solid ground in which to sink a shaft, and passing by gully after gully that has never even been prospected although in the midst of gold workings and having all the indications of being highly auriferous ; also, such new comers as arrive here from time to time, seem in general to acquire suddenly an aversion to prospecting new ground, for after looking at a I forward a plan showing the position of the Exploration Reef, and should the alluvial sinking turn out payable, 1 will make a more minute survey thereof.

Quartz mining has been rather dull at Anderson's Creek during the month of December, there .having been but 7 tons of quartz crushed there during that month. A slight rush of about thirty miners has taken place at a gully known as Thompson's Gully at the Kangaroo Ground. This gully commences in portion 2 of section 1 in the parish of Nillumbik and runs north-east until it meets Ford's Gully, about a mile above its junction with Watson's Creek. The sinking in this gully varies from 4 to 20 feet through the usual gravelly clay, to the washing stuff, which is in general from 6 inches to 1 foot in depth, and resting upon hard brown shale. The greatest yield, as yet, has been but half a dwt. of gold to the tub. few of the worked out gullies, they invariably return to Melbourne, without disturbing a single shovel full of earth ; this they call giving the place a trial. Were the sinking of a shaft a comparatively weighty undertaking, such as it is on some of the other gold fields, this would not be at all surprising, from the impoverished condition of the generality of the miners here ; but when it is known that the depth of sinking here does not in general exceed from 8 to 10 feet, with nothing harder than clay to penetrate, and involving the removal of but from 3 to 5 cubic yards of earth in the sinking of a shaft, it is strange that there should be so many square miles of auriferous country untried within a day's march of Melbourne, and with so many able bodied men actually living upon it ; some of whom are bordering on destitution and very few of whom are earning a pound- a week. On the Caledonian gold field, but little has been done in quartz mining during the past month ; however, it is likely that many of the alluvial miners will turn their attention to quartz mining as soon as opportunity serves. The discovery of two auriferous quartz reefs in the neighborhood of the Yow Yow has been rumoured about during the last few days, and I have no doubt the number of quartz miners will be considerably increased as soon as these discoveries are fully made known. This state of things can only be attributed to a want of even the lowest degree of enterprise on the part of some of the diggers, a mis direction of labor on the part of others of them, and decided indolence on the part of the rest of them. From the immense extent of auriferous ground of moderate depth, and which would yield from a i of an oz to 2 oz. of gold to the load, there is an ample field for the intro duction of puddliDg machinery in this division ; where I have no doubt, that by adopting a judicious system of working, such as is carried out on other gold fields, and by one or two parties here, with considerable success, the returns would be highly satisfactory. The quartz crushing machine at the town ship of Queenstown has changed owners, and is about to undergo considerable alter ations and improvements. The price of crushing at this mill is to be 15s. per ton. This will be of immense advantage' to the miners of this locality, if they will only avail themselves of it, by turning their attention to the more certain and remunerative occupation of quartz mining. At Anderson's Creek, several parties are said to be doing remarkably well on portions of the ground formerly held under lease by the Yarra Yarra Mining Company. As to the truth of this statement, the best proof of it is, that the men at work there, being all diggers, without capital, have continued working the I herewith forward sheet No. 31, of plans illustrative of my division, it being a plan of part 5 of Back or Diamond Creek.

The price of gold during the month in the division has been from \u00a33 15s to \u00a33 16s. per oz. No quartz crushed or mined this month. Although little change in mining matters has taken place in the division during the month, some improvement is visible in a few claims on the Southern Cross and Garibaldi Leads, resulting partly from the richness of the area operated upon, but chiefly from the effi ciency of the machinery and the superior system adopted in working the ground. The missing leads recently re-opened at Poverty Point and Red Streak, are already proving highly remunerative to the discoverers. New King Charlie's has yielded a fair prospect, and Ararat Flat and perhaps Leather Jacket Gully are likely to be added to the list of re suscitated leads during the coming month. The whole of the sluicing companies are getting good returns, and most of the puddlers and a few tub and cradle men are realizing weekly dividends of \u00a32 1 0s. to \u00a34 per man, and the system of steam puddling about to be introduced near Golden Point, on the Upper Main Lead, must tell favorably on the yield of gold from that locality.

In the Waterloo section of the division at Wingfields Lead, the Golden Gate Company have abandoned their claim from want of capi tal to continue their operations. The Great Extended Company are still in occupation of their claim, but display great dilatoriness in their mining operations, owing to some misunderstanding between the share holders and their furnishers. Several men have withdrawn from the company, and the yield of gold has only been 14 oz. during the month. The Lone Star Company have sunk two shafts, but have not yet reached the gutter. At Carpenter's Lead, Surface Point, New Jonathan's, and Eaglehawk Leads, and at Waterloo and Bill's Hills, the population em ployed and the results obtained, are similar to those of last month. giving fair remuneration to a sew parties at puddling and a few tub and cradle men. On Charcoal Lead a single party of pud dlers and the Charcoal Whim Company are making fair wages, and are nearly the only occupants. The central portion of the Main Lead, be tween Jonathan's and Charcoal Gullies, con tinues in the almost exclusive possession of Chinese, six large companies of whom employ whims and puddling mills, and a still larger number are working with tub and cradle. On the Lower Main Lead the Raglan Com pany are making a fair return. The Flying Buck Company have erected their puddling machinery and re-organized the company, but have not yet obtained gold in remunerative quantity. Indeed, I may men tion that some doubt exists whether the Raglan Company are not working in Charcoal Lead, and whether the Lower Main Lead is anything more than a myth. At Paddy's Lead the Prince Alfred Company are busily engaged in sinking a new shaft (having lost the old one), and are shifting the engine to the new site. Perseverance, Paton's, Shicer, and New King Charlie's Gullies, continue to yield moderate returns to a small European population, and at the latter place the discoverers of the lost lead are likely to realize good results from then claims, if they can secure sufficient capital to erect a whim. On Argyle Lead, the Chinese, Better-Late than-Never, and Royal Oak Companies, are still getting fair dividends, although the yield from these claims is much smaller than in former months. At Ararat Flat the Cockatoo Prospecting Company have sunk two shafts, but have not yet succeeded in reaching the gutter or obtain ing gold on the reef. On McCooke's Lead, the Prospect Company exhibit great tardiness in their operations ; they are getting dividends of \u00a33 per week, and not working half their time. On the Red Streak, James and party have discovered the lost lead, and are realizing 1 oz to the load. They are about to erect a whim. The adjacent leads towards Sulky Flat, employ but a small population. Un Hamburg and Charlton's Leads the few parties employed there continue to obtain a fair return ; VV arner's claim at the head of Charl ton's Lead, being at present the most remune rative in the Waterloo section of the division. On the Ding-dong Lead, the Prospect Claim has only yielded 40 oz this month ; the ave rage yield of this claim from the time the first shaft was bottomed has been 80 oz. monthly. On the Garibaldi Lead, the Great Republic Company were obtaining about 6 oz. weekly in the beginning of the month, but the incapa city of the engine and the pressure of creditors induced the remaining shareholders to suspend operations, and the engine has been sold by order of the mortgagees. The Olive Branch Company's claim has yielded 25^ oz. from 1st to 23rd of the current month, and 57^- oz. from 24th November to 23rd December inclusive. The ground in this claim is of a very rotten description, and the timber costs 9s per set. The company are working at great disadvantage from the small ness of their engine. The Royal Standard Company's claim has yielded 118 oz. 9 dwt. during the month. It is rumored that this company have struck a new lead, and they have their boundary iu dispute with the original prospectors. The Garibaldi Prospectors have lost the In the Fiery Creek portion of the division, several of the leads are quite deserted, but Mad man's and Long Gullies are yielding a good return to the small population engaged there. At Kennedy's or Harrison's Gully a small party of puddlers are obtaining about 9 oz. weekly. At the Surface Hill west the Wimmera Com pany have reoccupied their old claim with very good results, and intend to continue their opera tions in this locality all the summer. On the Yam Holes watershed, the upper portion of the old Main Lead and its tributaries, eastern and western, continue as usual to give remunerative employment to about 120 Euro peans, owners of puddling mills and tub and cradle men, besides a large number of Chinese of both classes. The erection of a 10 horse-power steam engine for puddling purposes by Messrs. Allen and Company, and an extra machine or two in old Tipperary Gully, recently erected there by Chinese, are the only indications of in creased activitv hereabout. Sawpit, Nuggety, and Close's Gullies are H"], [606, "576 MINING SURVEYORS' REPORTS \u2014 DECEMBER. Humphreys and Party (No. 5, formerly 8) are getting out wash-dirt that is giving \u00a31 10s. weekly, but they only recently opened out and have not yet reached the course of the lead. At Sailors' Gully (below the junction with Arden's), about twenty-five Europeans having erected five puddling machines and constructed some small dams for the storage of storm water, are realizing fair returns, from ground which was abandoned several years ago as non-remu nerative. A number of Chinese still flourish here. lead, or been working on a very poor part of it for the last two months. '1 heir claim has yielded only 22 oz. during the current month. At Jock's Flat, the Champion of the Seas Company have commenced blocking back, with somewhat improved results. This claim yielded 24 oz. up to Christmas Day. and they have obtained about 10 oz. since that date. The Shamrock and Thistle Company has ceased to exist, the engine has been sold by auction. The claim yielded about 22 oz. from about 80 loads of dirt ; but as the ground is yet supposed to be payably auriferous, some of the old shareholders are making an effort to form a more efficient party in order to give it a new trial. Unity and Bolton's Gullies still contain a few European miners. A prospecting party is vigorously at work between this locality and Trewalla. At Poverty Point the prospectors have ob tained gold in payable quantities and intend shortly to erect machinery. At Leather Jacket Gully, Gerrard and party are engaged in prospecting for the missing lead. The yield of gold from the Southern Cross and Garibaldi Leads, are made up to the 28th instant, although owing to the holidays but little work has been done since Christmas Day. The Old White Star Whim claim is worked out. > The New White Star Whim claim has recently yielded 4 oz to the machine. Jenkinson's Gully still gives employment to a small population, principally Chinese. At the Old Yam Hills good surfacing has been recently discovered by some tub and cradle men working near the Gap dam. They have set up a torn and are likely to do well for some time. The Steam Sluicing Company continue to declare weekly dividends of \u00a34. On the Southern Cross Lead, the Homeward Bound Company's engine and plant, are in a forward state and will soon be in active opera tion. With the cessation of the holidays and the rush to New Zealand, and the completion of the machinery now in course of erection and ex pected to arrive shortly, the division will quickly show an increased escort return with out any fresh accession of population. I may mention that the quantity of gold sent by escort this year, has exceeded that ot 1860 by about 5500 oz The average weekly purchases of the Bank of Victoria, are usually under 400 oz. but have recently exceeded 500 oz., so that whilst the mining population has decreased from various causes at least 20 per cent, during the last six months, the yield of gold has increased in nearly an inverse ratio. It must, however, be admitted that the greater depth of sinking which has been attained, has rendered necessary a much larger amount of capital and skilled labor, and ma terially enhanced the cost of production. The Royal Saxon Company have recently broken through to wash-dirt, and will com mence puddling forthwith. The Southern Cross Company's claim has only yielded 20 oz. this month, this is owing to the shareholders driving direct for the boundary regardless of the course of the lead. Searle and party (No. 2 South) have realized dividends of \u00a37 per man, weekly. Phillips and party (No. 3 South) have obtained from their claim 71 oz in eighteen days, giving a net dividend of \u00a310 6s. 8d. per man, per week. Webb and party (No. 4) are getting weekly dividends of \u00a33 10s. By Authority: John Fbrres, Government Primer, Melbourne."], [607, ""], [608, ""], [609, ""], [610, ""], [611, ""], [612, ""]]
