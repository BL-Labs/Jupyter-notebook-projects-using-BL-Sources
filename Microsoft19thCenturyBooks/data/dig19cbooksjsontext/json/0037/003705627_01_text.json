The slender Story of his Life is curiously twined about that of two other very considerable Figures in their Time and Country : one of whom tells the Story of all Three. This was Nizam ul Mulk, Vizyr to Alp Arslan the Son. and Malik Shah the Grandson, of Toghrul Beg the Tartar, who had wrested Persia from the feeble Successor of Mahmiid the Great, B"], [10, "OMAR KHAYYAM 2 and founded that Seljukian Dynasty which finally roused Europe into the Crusades. This Nizam ul Mulk, in his Wasiyat \u2014 or Testament \u2014 which he wrote and left as a Memorial for future Statesmen \u2014 relates the following, as quoted in the Calcutta Review, No. lix., from Mirkhond's History of the Assassins. \" ' One of the greatest of the wise men of Khorassan was the Imam Mowaffak of Naishapur, a man highly honoured and reverenced,\u2014 may God rejoice his soul ; his illustrious years exceeded eighty-five, and it was the uni- versal belief that every boy who read the Koran or studied the traditions in his presence, would assuredly attain to honour and happiness. For this cause did my father send me from Tiis to Naishapur with Abd-us-samad, the doctor of law, that I might employ myself in study and learning under the guidance of that illustrious teacher. Towards me he ever turned an eye of favour and kindness, and as"], [11, "THE ASTRONOMER-POET OF PERSIA 3 his pupil I felt for him extreme affection and devotion, so that I passed four years in his service. When I first came there, I found two other pupils of mine own age newly arrived, Hakim Omar Khayyam, and the ill-fated Ben Sabbah. Both were endowed with sharpness of wit and the highest natural powers ; and we three formed a close friendship together. When the Imam rose from his lectures, they used to join me, and we repeated to each other the lessons we had heard. Now Omar was a native of Naishapur, while Hasan Ben Sabbah's father was one Ali, a man of austere life and practice, but heretical in his creed and doctrine. One day Hasan said to me and to Khayyam, \" It is a universal belief that the pupils of the Imam Mowaffak will attain to fortune. Now. even if we all do not attain thereto, without doubt one of us will ; what then shall be our mutual pledge and bond ? \" We answered, \" Be it what you please.\" \u2014 \" Well,\" he said, \" let"], [12, "OMAR KHAYYAM 4 us make a vow, that to whomsoever this fortune falls, he shall share it equally with the rest, and reserve no pre- eminence for himself.\" \u2014 \" Be it so,\" we both replied, and on those terms we mutually pledged our words. Years rolled on, and I went from Khorassan to Transoxiana, and wandered to Ghazni and Cabul ; and when I returned, I was invested with office, and rose to be administrator of affairs during the Sultanate of Sultan Alp Arslan.' \" He goes on to state, that years passed by, and both his old school-friends found him out, and came and claimed a share in his good fortune, according to the school-day vow. The Vizier was generous and kept his word. Hasan demanded a place in the government, which the Sultan granted at the Vizier's request ; but discontented with a gradual rise, he plunged into the maze of intrigue of an Oriental Court, and, failing in a base attempt to supplant his benefactor, he was disgraced and fell. After"], [13, "THE ASTRONOMER-POET OF PERSIA 5 many mishaps and wanderings, Hasan became the head of the Persian sect of the Ismailians, \u2014 a party of fanatics who had long murmured in obscurity, but rose to an evil eminence under the guidance of his strong and evil will. In A.D. 1090, he seized the castle of Alamiit, in the pro- vince of Riidbar, which lies in the mountainous tract south of the Caspian Sea ; and it was from this mountain home he obtained that evil celebrity among the Crusaders as the OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAINS, and spread terror through the Mohammedan world ; and it is yet disputed whether the word Assassin, which they have left in the language of modern Europe as their dark memorial, is derived from the hashish, or opiate of hemp-leaves (the Indian bhang), with which they maddened themselves to the sullen pitch of Oriental desperation, or from the name of the founder of the dynasty, whom we have seen in his quiet collegiate days, at Naishapur. One of the countless"], [14, "OMAR KHAYYAM 6 victims of the Assassin's dagger was Nizam ul Mulk him- self, the old school-boy friend.1 \" Omar Khayyam also came to the Vizier to claim his share ; but not to ask for title or office. ' The greatest boon you can confer on me,' he said, ' is to let me live in a corner under the shadow of your fortune, to spread wide the advantages of Science, and pray for your long life and prosperity.' The Vizier tells us, that, when he found Omar was really sincere in his refusal, he pressed him no further, but granted him a yearly pension of 1200 mithkdls of gold, from the treasury of Naishapur. \" At Naishapur thus lived and died Omar Khayyam, 1 Some of Omar's Rubaiyat warn us of the danger of Greatness, the instability of Fortune, and while advocating Charity to all Men, recommend ing us to be too intimate with none.

Under the Sultanate of Malik Shah, he came to Merv, and obtained great praise for his proficiency in science, and the Sultan showered favours upon him.' \" When Malik Shah determined to reform the calendar, Omar was one of the eight learned men employed to do it ; the result was the faldli era (so called from faldl-ud- din, one of the king's names) \u2014 ' a computation of time,' says Gibbon, ' which surpasses the Julian, and approaches the accuracy of the Gregorian style.' He is also the author of some astronomical tables, entitled Ziji-Malik- shahi,\" and the French have lately republished and trans- lated an Arabic Treatise of his on Algebra. \" His Takhallus or poetical name (Khayyam) signifies a Tentmaker, and he is said to have at one time exercised"], [16, "8 OMAR KHAYYAM that trade, perhaps before Nizam ul Mulk's generosity raised him to independence. Many Persian poets simi- larly derive their names from their occupations ; thus we have Attar, ' a druggist,' Assar, ' an oil presser,' etc.1 Omar himself alludes to his name in the following whim sical lines : \u2014 \" ' Khayyam, who stitched the tents of science, Has fallen in grief's furnace and been suddenly burned ; The shears of Fate have cut the tent ropes of his life, And the broker of Hope has sold him for nothing !' We have only one more anecdote to give of his Life, and that relates to the close ; it is told in the anonymous preface which is sometimes prefixed to his poems ; it has been printed in the Persian in the Appendix to Hyde's Veterum Persarum Religio, p. 499 ; and 1 Though all these, like our Smiths, Archers, Millers, Fletchers, etc., may simply retain the Surname of an hereditary calling."], [17, "THE ASTRONOMER-POET OF PERSIA 9 D'Herbelot alludes to it in his Bibliotheque, under Khiam : x \u2014 \" ' It is written in the chronicles of the ancients that this King of the Wise, Omar Khayyam, died at Naishapur in the year of the Hegira, 5 17 (A.D. 1 123) ; in science he was unrivalled, \u2014 the very paragon of his age. Khwajah Nizami of Samarcand, who was one of his pupils, relates the following story : \" I often used to hold conversations with my teacher, Omar Khayyam, in a garden ; and one day he said to me, ' My tomb shall be in a spot where the north wind may scatter roses over it.' I wondered at the words he spake, but I knew that his were no idle words.2 1 \" Philosophe Musulman qui a vecu en Odeur de Saintete dans sa Religion, vers la Fin du premier et le Commencement du second Siecle,\" no part of which, except the \" Philosophe,\" can apply to our Khayyam. 2 The Rashness of the Words, according to D'Herbelot, consisted in being so opposed to those in the Koran: \"No Man knows where he shall die.\" \u2014 This story of Omar reminds me of another so naturally \u2014 and when one remembers how wide of his humble mark the noble sailor aimed \u2014 so"], [18, "OMAR KHAYYAM 10 Years after, when I chanced to revisit Naishapur, I went to his final resting-place, and lo ! it was just outside a garden, and trees laden with fruit stretched their boughs over the garden wall, and dropped their flowers upon his tomb, so that the stone was hidden under them.\" ' \" Thus far \u2014 without fear of Trespass \u2014 from the Calcutta Review. The writer of it, on reading in India this story of Omar's Grave, was reminded, he says, of Cicero's Account of finding Archimedes's Tomb at Syracuse, buried pathetically told by Captain Cook \u2014 not by Doctor Hawkesworth \u2014 in his Second Voyage (i. 374). When leaving Ulietea, \" Oreo's last request was for me to return. When he saw he could not obtain that promise, he asked the name of my Marai (burying-place). As strange a question as this was, I hesitated not a moment to tell him ' Stepney ' ; the parish in which I live when in London. I was made to repeat it several times over till they could pronounce it ; and then ' Stepney Marai no Toote ' was echoed through an hundred mouths at once. I afterwards found the same question had been put to Mr. Forster by a man on shore ; but he gave a different, and indeed more proper answer, by saying, ' No man who used the sea could say where he should be buried.' \""], [19, "THE ASTRONOMER-POET OF PERSIA 11 in grass and weeds. I think Thorwaldsen desired to have roses grow over him ; a wish religiously fulfilled for him to the present day, I believe. However, to return to Omar. Though the Sultan \" shower'd Favours upon him,\" Omar's Epicurean Audacity of Thought and Speech caused him to be regarded askance in his own Time and Country. He is said to have been especially hated and dreaded by the Sufis, whose Practice he ridiculed, and whose Faith amounts to little more than his own, when stript of the Mysticism and formal recognition of Islamism under which Omar would not hide. Their Poets, includ- ing Hafiz, who are (with the exception of Firdausi) the most considerable in Persia, borrowed largely, indeed, of Omar's material, but turning it to a mystical Use more convenient to Themselves and the People they addressed ; a People quite as quick of Doubt as of Belief ; as keen of"], [20, "OMAR KHAYYAM 12 Bodily Sense as of Intellectual ; and delighting in a cloudy composition of both, in which they could float luxuriously between Heaven and Earth, and this World and the Next, on the wings of a poetical expression, that might serve indifferently for either. Omar was too honest of Heart as well as of Head for this. Having failed (however mistakenly) of finding any Providence but Destiny, and any World but This, he set about making the most of it ; preferring rather to soothe the Soul through the Senses into Acquiescence with Things as he saw them, than to perplex it with vain disquietude after what they might be. It has been seen, however, that his Worldly Ambition was not exorbitant ; and he very likely takes a humorous or perverse pleasure in exalting the gratification of Sense above that of the Intellect, in which he must have taken great delight, although it failed to answer the Questions in which"], [21, "THE ASTRONOMER-POET OF PERSIA 13 he, in common with all men, was most vitally in- terested For whatever Reason, however, Omar, as before said, has never been popular in his own Country, and therefore has been but scantily transmitted abroad. The MSS. of his Poems, mutilated beyond the average Casualties of Oriental Transcription, are so rare in the East as scarce to have reacht Westward at all, in spite of all the acquisitions of Arms and Science. There is no copy at the India House, none at the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris. We know but of one in England : No. 140 of the Ouseley MSS. at the Bodleian, written at Shiraz, A.D. 1460. This contains but 158 Rubaiyat. One in the Asiatic Society's Library at Calcutta (of which we have a Copy), contains (and yet incomplete) 5 1 6, though swelled to that by all kinds of Repetition and Corruption.

It may be rendered thus \u2014 \" Oh Thou who burn'st in Heart for those who burn In Hell, whose fires thyself shall feed in turn ; How long be crying, ' Mercy on them, God !

Both indeed were men of subtle, strong, and cultiv- ated Intellect, fine Imagination, and Hearts passionate for Truth and Justice ; who justly revolted from their Country's false Religion, and false, or foolish, Devotion to it ; but who fell short of replacing what they subverted by such better Hope as others, with no better Revelation 1 Professor Cowell."], [24, "16 OMAR KHAYYAM to guide them, had yet made a Law to themselves.

Somewhat as in the Greek Alcaic, where the penultimate line seems to lift and suspend the Wave that falls over in the last. As usual with such kind of Oriental Verse, the Rubaiyat follow one another according to Alphabetic Rhyme \u2014 a strange succession of Grave and Gay.

Either way, the Result is sad enough : saddest perhaps when most ostentatiously merry : more apt to move Sorrow than Anger toward the old Tent maker, who, after vainly endeavouring to unshackle his Steps from Destiny, and to catch some authentic Glimpse of To-MORROW, fell back upon To-DAY (which has out lasted so many To-morrows !) as the only Ground he had got to stand upon, however momentarily slipping from under his Feet. While the second Edition of this version of Omar was preparing, Monsieur Nicolas, French Consul at Resht, published a very careful and very good Edition of the Text, from a lithograph copy at Teheran, comprising 464 Rubaiyat, with translation and notes of his own. Mons. Nicolas, whose Edition has reminded me of"], [27, "THE ASTRONOMER-POET OF PERSIA 19 several things, and instructed me in others, does not consider Omar to be the material Epicurean that I have literally taken him for, but a Mystic, shadowing the Deity under the figure of Wine, Wine-bearer, etc., as Hafiz is supposed to do ; in short, a Sufi Poet like Hafiz and the rest. I cannot see reason to alter my opinion, formed as it was more than a dozen years ago x when Omar was first shown me by one to whom I am indebted for all I know of Oriental, and very much of other, literature. He admired Omar's Genius so much, that he would gladly have adopted any such Interpretation of his mean ing as Mons. Nicolas's if he could.2 That he could not, appears by his Paper in the Calcutta Review already so 1 [This was written in 1868.\u2014 W. A.

Nicolas's Theory on the other."], [28, "OMAR KHAYYAM 20 largely quoted ; in which he argues from the Poems themselves, as well as from what records remain of the Poet's Life. And if more were needed to disprove Mons. Nicolas's Theory, there is the Biographical Notice which he him self has drawn up in direct contradiction to the Interpret ation of the Poems given in his Notes. (See pp. xiii., xiv. of his Preface.) Indeed I hardly knew poor Omar was so far gone till his Apologist informed me. For here we see that, whatever were the Wine that Hafiz drank and sang, the veritable Juice of the Grape it was which Omar used, not only when carousing with his friends, but (says Mons. Nicolas) in order to excite him self to that pitch of Devotion which others reached by cries and \"hurlemens.\" And yet, whenever Wine, Wine bearer, etc., occur in the text \u2014 which is often enough \u2014 Mons. Nicolas carefully annotates \" Dieu,\" \" La Divinite,\""], [29, "THE ASTRONOMER-POET OF PERSIA 21 etc.: so carefully indeed that one is tempted to think that he was indoctrinated by the Sufi with whom he read the Poems. (Note to Rub. ii. p. 8.) A Persian would naturally wish to vindicate a distinguished Countryman ; and a Sufi to enrol him in his own sect, which already comprises all the chief Poets of Persia. What historical Authority has Mons. Nicolas to show that Omar gave himself up \" avec passion a l'etude de la philosophic des Soufis \" ? (Preface, p. xiii.) The Doctrines of Pantheism, Materialism, Necessity, etc., were not peculiar to the Sufi ; nor to Lucretius before them ; nor to Epicurus before him ; probably the very original Irreligion of Thinking men from the first ; and very likely to be the spontaneous growth of a Philosopher living in an Age of social and political barbarism, under shadow of one of the Two and Seventy Religions supposed to divide the world. Von Hammer (according to"], [30, "2 2 OMAR KHAYYAM Sprenger's Oriental Catalogue) speaks of Omar as \"a Free-thinker, and a great opponent of Sufistn ;\" perhaps because, while holding much of their Doctrine, he would not pretend to any inconsistent severity of morals. Sir W. Ouseley has written a note to something of the same effect on the fly-leaf of the Bodleian MS. And in two Rubaiyat of Mons. Nicolas's own Edition Siif and Sufi are both disparagingly named. No doubt many of these Quatrains seem unaccountable unless mystically interpreted ; but many more as un accountable unless literally. Were the Wine spiritual, for instance, how wash the Body with it when dead ? Why make cups of the dead clay to be filled with \u2014 \" La Divinite \" \u2014 by some succeeding Mystic ? Mons. Nicolas himself is puzzled by some \" bizarres \" and \" trop Orien tals \" allusions and images \u2014 \" d'une sensuality quelquefois revoltante \" indeed \u2014 which \" les convenances \" do not"], [31, "THE ASTRONOMER-POET OF PERSIA 23 permit him to translate ; but still which the reader can not but refer to \" La DiviniteV' : No doubt also many of the Quatrains in the Teheran, as in the Calcutta, Copies, are spurious ; such Rubdiydt being the common form of Epigram in Persia. But this, at best, tells as much one way as another ; nay, the Sufi, who may be considered the Scholar and Man of Letters in Persia, would be far more likely than the careless Epicure to interpolate what favours his own view of the Poet. I 1 A Note to Quatrain 234 admits that, however clear the mystical mean ing of such Images must be to Europeans, they are not quoted without \"rougissant\" even by laymen in Persia \u2014 \"Quant aux termes de tendresse qui commencent ce quatrain, comme tant d'autres dans ce recueil, nos lecteurs, habitues maintenant a 1'etrangete des expressions si souvent employees par Kheyam pour rendre ses pensees sur l'amour divin, et a la singularite de ses images trop orientales, d'une sensualite quelquefois revoltante, n'auront pas de peine a se persuader qu'il s'agit de la Divinite, bien que cette conviction soit vivement discutee par les moullahs musulmans et meme par beaucoup de laiques, qui rougissent veritablement d'une pareille licence de leur compatriote a 1'egard des choses spirituelles. \""], [32, "OMAR KHAYYAM 24 observe that very few of the more mystical Quatrains are in the Bodleian MS. which must be one of the oldest, as dated at Shiraz, A.H. 865, A.D. 1460.

I must say that I, for one, never wholly believed in the Mysticism of Hafiz.

And all for what ? To be tantalized with Images of sensual enjoy ment which must be renounced if one would approximate a God, who according to the Doctrine, is Sensual Matter as well as Spirit, and into whose Universe one expects unconsciously to merge after Death, without hope of any posthumous Beatitude in another world to compensate for all one's self-denial in this.

Before the Snow is well off the Ground, the Trees burst into Blossom, and the Flowers start forth from the Soil. At Now Rooz [their New Year's Day] the Snow was lying in patches on the Hills and in the shaded Vallies, while the Fruit-trees in the Gardens were budding beau tifully, and green Plants and Flowers springing up on the Plains on every side \u2014 ' And on old Hyems' Chin and icy Crown An odorous Chaplet of sweet Summer buds Is, as in mockery, set.' \u2014 1 Two Years' Travel in Persia, etc., i. 165"], [72, "64 NOTES Among the Plants newly appeared I recognised some old Acquaintances I had not seen for many a Year : among these, two varieties of the Thistle \u2014 a coarse species of Daisy like the ' Horse-gowan ' \u2014 red and white Clover \u2014 the Dock \u2014 the blue Corn-flower \u2014 and that vulgar Herb the Dandelion rearing its yellow crest on the Banks of the Water-courses.\" The Nightingale was not yet heard, for the Rose was not yet blown : but an almost identical Blackbird and Wood pecker helped to make up something of a North-country Spring. \"The White Hand of Moses.\" Exodus iv. 6; where Moses draws forth his Hand \u2014 not, according to the Persians, \" leprous as Snow,\" \u2014 but white, as our May-blossom in Spring perhaps.

Hafiz also speaks of the Nightingale's Pehlevi, which did not change with the People's. I am not sure if the fourth line refers to the Red Rose looking sickly, or to the Yellow Rose that ought to be Red ; Red, White, and Yellow Roses all common in Persia. I think that Southey, in his Common-Place Book, quotes from some Spanish author about the Rose being White till 10 o'clock ; \" Rosa Perfecta \" at 2 ; and \" persecta incarnada \" at 5. (x.)

Others refer it to the Work of the Genie King, Jan Ibn Jan \u2014 who also built the Pyramids \u2014 before the time of Adam. Bahram Gur \u2014 Bahrain of the Wild Ass \u2014 a Sassanian Sovereign \u2014 had also his Seven Castles (like the King of Bohemia !) each of a different Colour : each with a Royal Mistress within ; each of whom tells him a Story, as told in one of the most famous Poems of Persia, written by Amir Khusraw : all these Sevens also figuring (according to Eastern Mysticism) the Seven Heavens ; and perhaps the Book itself that Eighth, into which the mystical Seven transcend, and within which they revolve. The Ruins of Three of those Towers are yet shown by the Peasantry ; as also the Swamp in which Bahram sunk, like the Master of Ravenswood, while pursuing his Giir. The Palace that to Heav'n his pillars threw, And Kings the forehead on his threshold drew \u2014 I saw the solitary Ringdove there, And \"Coo, coo, coo,\" she cried ; and \"Coo, coo, coo.\" This Quatrain Mr. Binning found, among several of Hafiz and others, inscribed by some stray hand among the ruins of Persepolis. The Ringdove's ancient Pehlevi Coo, Coo, Coo, signifies also in Persian \" Where? Where? Where ? \" In Attar's \"Bird-parliament \" she is reproved by the Leader of the Birds for sitting still, and for ever harping on that one note of lamentation for her lost Yiisuf.

(xxi.) A thousand years to each Planet. (xxxi.) Saturn, Lord of the Seventh Heaven. (xxxn.) Me-and-Thee: some dividual Existence or Personality distinct from the Whole. (xxxvil.) One of the Persian Poets \u2014 Attar, I think \u2014 has a pretty story about this. A thirsty Traveller dips his hand into a Spring of Water to drink from. By and by comes another who draws up and drinks from an earthen Bowl, and then departs, leaving his Bowl behind him. The first Traveller takes it up for another draught ; but is surprised to find that the same Water which had tasted sweet from his own hand tastes bitter from the earthen Bowl. But a Voice \u2014 from Heaven, I think \u2014 tells him the clay from which the Bowl is made was once Man ; and, into whatever shape renewed, can never lose the bitter flavour of Mortality. (xxxix.) The custom of throwing a little Wine on the ground before drinking still continues in Persia, and perhaps generally in the East. Mons. Nicolas considers it \" un signe de liberalite, et en meme temps un avertisse ment que le buveur doit vider sa coupe jusqu'a la derniere goutte.\" Is it not more likely an ancient Superstition ; a Libation to propitiate Earth, or make her an Accomplice in the illicit Revel ? Or, perhaps, to divert the Jealous Eye by some sacrifice of superfluity, as with the Ancients of the West ? With Omar we see something more is signified ; the precious Liquor is not lost, but sinks into the ground to refresh the dust of some poor Wine-worshipper foregone. Thus Hafiz, copying Omar in so many ways : \" When thou drinkest Wine"], [75, "67 NOTES pour a draught on the ground. Wherefore fear the Sin which brings to another Gain?\" (xliii.)

A Jest, of course, at his Studies. A curious mathematical Quatrain of Omar's has been pointed out to me ; the more curious because almost exactly parallel'd by some Verses of Doctor Donne's, that are quoted in Izaak Walton's Lives 1 Here is Omar : \"You and I are the image of a pair of compasses ; though we have two heads (sc. our feet) we have one body ; when we have fixed the centre for our circle, we bring our heads (sc. feet) together at the end.\" Dr. Donne : If we be two, we two are so As stiff twin-compasses are two ; Thy Soul, the fixt foot, makes no show To move, but does if the other do.

This Relation of Pot and Potter to Man and his Maker figures far and wide in the Literature of the World, from the time of the Hebrew Prophets to the present ; when it may finally take the name of \" Pot theism,\" by which Mr. Carlyle ridiculed Sterling's \"Pantheism.\" My Sheikh, whose knowledge flows in from all quarters, writes to me \u2014 ' ' Apropos of old Omar's Pots, did I ever tell you the sentence I found in Bishop Pearson on the Creed ? ' Thus are we wholly at the disposal of His will, and our present and future condition framed and ordered by His free, but wise and just, decrees. Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour ? (Rom. ix. 21.)

The first stanza is entirely his own, and in stanza XXXI. of the fourth edition (xxxvi. in the second) he has introduced two lines from Attar (See Letters, p. 251). In stanza Lxxxi. (fourth edition), writes Professor Cowell, \" There is no original for the line about the snake : I have looked for it in vain in Nicolas ; but I have always supposed that the last line is FitzGerald's mistaken version of Quatr. 236 in Nicolas's ed. which runs thus : \" O thou who knowest the secrets of every one's mind, Who graspest every one's hand in the hour of weakness, O God, give me repentance and accept my excuses, O thou who givest repentance and acceptest the excuses of every one. \"FitzGerald mistook the meaning of giving and accepting as used here, and so invented his last line out of his own mistake. I wrote to him about it when I was in Calcutta ; but he never cared to alter it.\" THE END Printed by R. & R. Clark, Edinburgh"], [121, ""], [122, ""], [123, ""], [124, ""]]
