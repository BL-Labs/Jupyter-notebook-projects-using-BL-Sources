The republication of the following series of Letters has been suggested by the interest in all questions connected with Russia to which the events of the present time have given rise. The Letters were written many years ago, but in the interim little change can have taken place in the manners and customs they describe. The character of the people, the principles of the government, the institutions of the country, and the relative positions of the different classes in the community remain unaltered. The book, therefore, in its descriptions of Russian life, its sketches of Russian habits and ideas, and its general picture of the social condi tion of the people, will convey no incorrect impression of the existing state of things. The peculiar circumstances under which the author visited the country, his position of intimacy in private families, and his constant opportunities of unreserved intercourse with Russians of the highest cha racter and intelligence, afforded him unusual advantages in acquiring authentic information. But when he proceeded to publish his Letters he found it a matter of some little difficulty and delicacy to speak of Russia with truth, and yet without committing any breach of confidence, and with out making an ill requital for the unbounded kindness and hospitality for which he was indebted to his friends in that country."], [12, "PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION. VI The object of the book is not to discuss the strength or the weakness of Russia, but to relate such incidents as may entertain or interest the reader, and to delineate such na tional and social characteristics as fell under the author's observation. At the present moment perhaps the relative positions of the landed noble and the serf may be deemed worthy of some attention. And with reference to this subject especial notice will naturally be directed to the oppressive system of the conscription \u2014 hateful to the nobles as a burthensome tax, and dreaded by the peasants as the worst of evils. Looking to the conscription and its effects, we must indeed give both those classes credit for the sternest principles of self-denying patriotism if we suppose war in the abstract to be popular with them. The peasant, it is true, has a fanatical venera tion for his Emperor, and the fallacious cry of a Holy War against the Infidel may make some impression on his mind. Yet the Russian serf has far more of the submissive resigna tion of a fatalist than of the spirit of a hero or a martyr in his character ; while his master, the noble, is undoubtedly no enthusiast \u2014 on the conservative side at least \u2014 in religion or in politics. Yet the Russian is by no means destitute of national pride, and it may reasonably be assumed that the contest with foreign enemies tends to stimulate the loyalty of the people and to check and deaden internal disaffection. The longer the contest lasted the more closely perhaps would the Government and the people of Russia be united, the more powerfully would the national spirit be roused, and the more cheerfully might the country submit to the neces sary sacrifices entailed by the war. Yet we may judge how terribly severe those sacrifices must already be, not only from the reports which have occasionally reached us of late, but from the consideration that men, money, and communications"], [13, "PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION. VII \u2014 the three first essentials of war \u2014 are three most prominent deficiencies in the wide but thinly inhabited regions of Russia. Mr. SabourofFs Letter on rural affairs, at the conclusion of this book, will furnish some interesting suggestions on this head. \" Time and money,\" says he (in one word, capital), \" are generally the very things of which landed proprietors in this country have least at their disposal.\" And again, \" Owing to our total deficiency in the means of internal com munication it sometimes happens that while in one part of the country there is a superabundance, another part is suffering from dearth.\" It must not be forgotten that Tamboff, the province more especially alluded to by Mr. Sabouroff, is stated by him to be by comparison peculiarly fortunate in the possession of channels of communication. It is, moreover, the very pro vince which was spoken of some years ago in our own par liament as the inexhaustible granary of Russia ; and the justice of this character is to a considerable degree borne out by Mr. SabourofFs descriptions of the great fertility and abundant produce of the district. The natural inference from all we know of Russia leads us to conclude that the country must already be greatly im poverished, and its resources fearfully strained by the war. Russia therefore cannot but earnestly long for peace. At the same time we must presume that, while on the one hand little sympathy is probably felt with the ambitious designs of the late Emperor, and with the aggressive policy of which the Grand Duke Constantine is now regarded as the cham pion ; yet, on the other hand, no indifference to the na tional honour of Russia is likely to stain any important class or body in the community. At the present moment prospects of peace have somewhat"], [14, "PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION. VIII unexpectedly opened upon us. The great question will doubtless have been decided before these pages issue from the press. All will rejoice if the expectations now confidently entertained be realised, and if the result of the pending negociations be peace \u2014 such a peace at least as shall secure the great ends for which we and our gallant allies have fought. All will rejoice if such terms of peace be ratified as shall prove Russia to be convinced that Europe will never permit the political abasement of the Crescent under the hypocritical pretext of exalting the Cross \u2014 that holy symbol, in sincere veneration for which we nevertheless at least equal Russia herself. All will rejoice if such a peace shall have been secured ; and if secured, it will be, with God's blessing, because we have boldly fought for it. The Russian has much of the Asiatic in his character, and he chiefly respects those who know how to make themselves respected. We shall be all the better friends with him hereafter, because he has seen that, though reluctant to draw the sword, we have been prepared to wield it when drawn \u2014 being always, what ever our alleged errors of strategy, or our temporary defects of organization, eager to fight, and able to fight well : Nee cauponantes bellurn, sed belligerantes. Nor is it only the terror of our naval power, or the indo mitable courage of Alma, or the heroism of Inkerman, or the fearless charge of Balaclava, or the unflinching toil and sleep less guards in the trenches before Sebastopol, or the not less glorious, though less fortunate defence of Kars, which will have been duly appreciated by our foes. The firm determination of the English people at home, the cordial support which the nation has invariably given to every energetic measure for pressing on the war, the undaunted attitude of the country, will not have been thrown away. Neither will Russia have failed"], [15, "PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION. IX to note the comparative ease with which the internal wealth and the unrestricted commerce of England have enabled her to meet the lavish expenditure of the war ; not exhausting but displaying her vast resources. Lastly, Russia will have learned that England and France united in a common cause can fight for it side by side with all their ancient spirit ; and that their enemies have nothing to hope from divided counsels or revived animosities. If these lessons have been already taught, as we trust they have, then the time is ripe for peace, and then the waste, and havoc, and bloodshed of another campaign may well be spared. If not \u2014 grievous as are the calamities of war \u2014 the respon sibility of its continuance, as of its commencement, will rest on other heads than ours. We are embarked in a just quarrel, and we cannot but fight it out to the end, if we have not done so already, now when we are in every way prepared. We cannot end our great contest by an incon clusive result. We cannot assent to peace \u2014 much as we love it \u2014 on terms which would leave the risk of our being forced at no distant period to re-engage in hostilities \u2014 per haps at a disadvantage. \" Peace is no peace if it lets the ill grow stronger, Merely cheating destiny a very little longer ; War, with its agonies, its horrors, and its crimes, Is cheaper if discounted and taken up betimes. God defend the right, and those that dare to claim it ! God cleanse the earth from the many ills that shame it!

I cannot venture to add another to the numerous books on Russia which have already appeared, without pleading as my apology that I visited that country under circumstances affording opportunities, not usually within a stranger's reach, of observing the habits and character of the people. I am therefore induced to publish the following Letters, under an impression that some account of domestic life in the Interior may be, to a certain degree, interesting from its novelty. Being nearly connected by marriage with several Russian families, I accompanied my wife into that country in the summer of 1837, for the purpose of visiting her relatives, among whom we spent twelve months, either in private houses in the Interior, or in habits of constant intercourse at St. Petersburg. In the Letters now offered to the public I have given a simple detail of our sojourn in Russia, interspersed by a few general remarks and observations. The court, the capital, the army, and the public institu tions of the country, together with its political position and views, have occupied the pens of far abler travellers. My object has been to give some description of private life, national customs, and domestic habits in Russia. January, 1839."], [18, ""], [19, "CONTENTS.

Account of voyage \u2014 Custom-house \u25a0 \u2014 Arrival at Petersburg \u2014 Passport regulations. St. Petersburg, June 22nd, 1837. I lose no time in sending you, according to promise, an account of our safe arrival here, after a pleasant and pros perous voyage of a week. We sailed from London on Wed nesday morning the 14th, and we landed on the English Quay at Petersburg on Wednesday the 21st. We crossed the North Sea to Hamburg in the Countess of Lonsdale, a voyage not very fertile of incidents. Most of the time we were enveloped in a fog which would have done credit to London itself in November, and which only left us, to our great joy, when we were preparing off Heligoland to anchor for the night, as the captain would not venture to enter the Elbe without seeing his way. The banks of the Elbe present no objects of interest until -seven or eight miles below Hamburg, when the ground on the right or Danish side of the river rises into bold slopes beautifully clothed with gardens and studded with villas, while the air was fragrant from the pro fusion of lilacs, now in that northern region in full luxuriance. Having spent a few hours in the picturesque old city of Hamburg, which I hope we shall have more leisure to visit on our homeward journey, we hired a carriage, the ordinary lohnkutsclie of Germany, the sight of which would collect a crowd in England, and at half past five on Friday afternoon we started for Lubeck, a distance of thirty-five miles. We travelled till after midnight, when we reached, not Lubeck, but a place called Schonberg, a sort of half-way house, .only B"], [26, "[Let. I. \u25a02 THE VOYAGE. twenty miles from Hamburg. Having no time to spare, we were in motion again at five in the morning, and we reached Lubeck at ten. This road, connecting two important cities, is probably the worst great highway in Europe. In one place we saw a waggon, and that not a very heavy one, sticking fast, in spito of the efforts of ten horses ; and, as you will infer from the time we spent over thirty-five miles, we performed most of the journey at a foot's pace. From Lubeck to Traavemunde, the port of the Baltic packets, is a stage of ten or twelve miles, with a good road, the luxury of which we fully appre ciated. We arrived there just in time to embark on board the Naslednik steamer, in which we sailed at three o'clock in the afternoon. We soon found that out of some twenty pas sengers we were the only English on board, with the exception of a king's messenger. Of the remainder, among natives of France, Germany, Holland, Sweden, and Persia, the Russians mustered in strongest force ; and sailing in their society in a Russian boat on the Baltic Sea, we almost felt that we had alreadjr reached the empire of the Czar. Some of our fellow voyagers spoke English, and all spoke French. The weather was all we could wish, and the arrangements and fare on board the packet were good. The Russian ladies soon dis covered that M \u2014 was by birth a countrywoman of their own, and one of them* proved to be well acquainted with her father and other members of her family. Under these circumstances our time passed rapidly and agreeably on board the Naslednik. We sailed, as I have said, on Saturday afternoon, and by nine o'clock on Monday night we were in the Gulf of Finland. The following morning we were off Revel, and the captain said we should be at Cronstadt before midnight. We scarcely lost sight of land during the whole of Tuesday, and both shores of the Gulf of Finland were often visible at the same time. Indeed, during the entire voyage we were seldom many hours without seeing land, and the successive islands * With this lady, Princess Ourousoff, and her son, a most agreeable and well-informed young man, who was also on board, we had the pleasure of renewing our acquaintance during our short stay in Moscow in the following March."], [27, "Let. I.] ARRIVAL AT CRONSTADT. 3 which marked our progress were never-failing objects of in terest. The number of ships, moreover, of which we could not unfrequently count one or two and twenty at a time around us, far and near, with their white sails set, helped to break the monotony of the passage ; while on one occasion we passed within five miles of a Russian squadron, consisting of ten or eleven men-of-war. Our eyes, therefore, when we were tired of reading, were never at a loss for occupation by day ; and in this latitude at midsummer one can hardly say that night comes at all. The sun, indeed, goes below the horizon for a couple of hours, but the sky does not lose its colouring, and the smallest print or the palest handwriting may be read with ease in the open air at midnight. On Tuesday night the approaching termination of our voyage drove away all idea of sleep, and no one thought of going below or of undressing. Indeed, at twelve o'clock by our London time, the Naslednik dropped her anchor under the batteries of Cronstadt, and in a few minutes afterwards the firing of the morning gun fro\u00bb the fortress, and the hoist ing of the colours on the flagstaff, reminded us of our progress to the east ; it being already, by Petersburg time, two o'clock in the morning. On coming to anchor, we were immediately boarded by two or three boats full of custom-house officers and soldiers, who appeared to take possession of the ship. The passengers' luggage was brought upon deck, and ticketed with the word unexamined, a number being added to each article ; and in this manner no less than three weary hours were consumed. The deck was encumbered with luggage, and at every turn one met a soldier in a dingy grey great coat, while the cabin was full of custom-house officers exa mining the passports, so that it was difficult to find a seat or a corner of a table at liberty. At length the custom-house officers departed, and allowed us to proceed up the Gulf, towards Petersburg, under the care of the soldiers, who were left on board. Our delays were, however, not yet over, for in crossing the bar of the Neva our boat ran aground, though she only drew about seven feet of water, and this accident detained us three hours. At last, b 2"], [28, "[Let. I. CUSTOM-HOUSE SCRUTINY. 4 by means of two anchors carried out a-head, we were warped once more into deep water, and soon afterwards we reached Petersburg, and came to our moorings at the English Quay about twelve o'clock. Several custom-house officers now came on board, and the passengers were allowed to step on shore on receiving their passports, which had been collected soon after we sailed from Traavemunde by the captain's book keeper. We were allowed to take our cloaks and great-coats on shore with us, but nothing else. Thanks to a friend to whom we had written beforehand, we found a laquais-de-place awaiting our landing, with the agreeable information that lodgings were engaged for us. It was necessaiy, as the first thing, to superintend the examination of our luggage by the custom-house officers, which agreeable ceremony was per formed in a large room hard by, set apart for the accommoda tion of steamboat passengers. The examination, though strict, could hardly be called vexatious, except that a new silk gown of M \u2014 's was very near being confiscated, all articles of dress unmade, or which have not been worn, being contraband. A little representation, however, to a superior officer who spoke French, conquered this difficulty. All our books were set aside to be examined by the censor, even a map in a case being subjected to this scrutiny. They were made up into a parcel and sealed with lead, and were then delivered to me tipon my signing a paper, in which I undertook to send them to the censor. The penalty for breaking or losing the lead seal is a hundred roubles (about four guineas). I was after wards required to sign one or two other papers, and at last I received a permit for my luggage to pass. The intro duction of poisonous drugs into the country is strictly pro hibited, and a small medicine chest which we had was still detained for further examination, but it was afterwards very civilly given up to me unopened. We were now conducted to our lodgings, and after our sleepless night and wearisome morning we were exceedingly glad to find ourselves by two o'clock in a place where we could sit down and rest at our ease. I have this morning been to write down my name at the Alien Office, the only personal trouble given to a foreigner"], [29, "Let. I.] PETERSBURG ALIEN OFFICE. 5 on his arrival by the police regulations. Our passport has been given to our landlord, whose duty it is to forward it to the proper authorities, by whom it is detained ; a ticket of residence, as it is called, or a permission to remain in the country, which must be renewed on the 1st of January every year, being sent in its place. Our books have been already returned from the censor's office, with a certificate that they have been examined, and are permitted; so that all the troubles of a first arrival are over, and we may consider our selves as fairly established in Petersburg. We do not mean, however, to remain here more than a few days, as the town is very empty, and we wish to lose as little as possible of the short Russian summer before we proceed into the interior, reserving the sights of Petersburg to be visited as we pass through on our way home. On attending at the Alien Office I encountered some of our French and German fellow-passengers. As they one after another completed the necessary forms and signed their names, I perceived that a demand of five roubles was made from each, and therefore when my turn came I laid down five roubles, like the rest, before the clerk. Somewhat to my surprise he waved his hand, and intimated that I had nothing to pay. I looked to my attendant for an explanation, and he said, \" Oh, they are merchants, and you are noble.\" \"How, noble?\" was my reply. \"Why,\" said he, \"you are in the English service; you are a clergyman.\" On quitting the custom-house, after the examination of our luggage, we noticed the first characteristic specimen we had seen of a Russian equipage, in the shape of an open carriage drawn by four horses abreast. It was proceeding slowly along, and a lady was walking on the foot-pavement by its side. Rather to my surprise, the lady accosted M \u2014 and em braced her, proving, when the unexpected salutation was explained, to be an aunt, who had very kindly driven in from her villa near Petersburg to greet us on our arrival. This agreeable little incident was no unfavourable omen of our reception by M \u2014 's family ; and it has been followed up by a similar occurrence in our walk this morning, so that I have already begun to make acquaintance with our Russian relatives."], [30, "[Let.

St. Petersburg, June 28th, 1837. We are on the point of leaving Petersburg, and we only await a conveyance to take us southwards, which, strange to say, in this great capital, is at this moment difficult to meet with. The plan which we mean to pursue, and which is the most comfortable of any that could be devised for strangers, is to hire a small diligence, which will be at our disposal for the journey. It will contain four people, besides the driver and conductor, who will manage everything upon the road, we paying a fixed sum for the journey before we start. We have engaged a man and a maid, the former of whom speaks Eng lish, and both speak German and Russian more or less. Most people are now in the country, but we have dined twice with M \u2014 's relatives since we have been here ; once in town, and once at a villa in the immediate neighbourhood. The dinners were served in the style usual on the Continent; nothing but the dessert being put on the table, and the dishes being brought in and handed round successively. The chief peculiarity to be remarked here was the custom of handing round liqueurs, with cheese, caviare, &c, before we went into the dining-room. We had also some national dishes, such as mushrooms of various kinds and of all colours, which, if they are to be found, no one would venture to eat in England. The principal novelty was an iced soup called Batvinia, of which the Russians appeared very fond, and without which they declared that a dinner in hot weather could not be called complete. Like most foreigners, however, I found it ex ceedingly bad, and, indeed, perfectly uneatable. It is made"], [31, "Let. IL] KAZAN CHURCH. 7 with quass (a Russian substitute for beer), chopped cucumbers, onions, &c. ; and a large slice of salt sturgeon is eaten with it. The Neva ran close before the windows of the villa where we dined, and in the evening we saw several horses brought down to have a swim in the river. The horses all seemed used to bathing, and I find that it is a general custom to give them a swim almost every evening during the summer. There are numerous small rafts to be seen at the edge of the river and of the canals for the washerwomen, who stand on them with bare legs and wash the linen in the water at the side, or at a hole about four feet square, which is cut in the middle of the raft. As we returned home we stopped to see the Kazan Church, which is the Cathedral of Petersburg. Another church, how ever, the St. Isaac's, which is now in progress, will, when finished, be far finer. The chief beauty of the Kazan Church consists in a handsome semicircular colonnade facing the street, and leading from either side to the principal entrance, and in the beautiful pillars of polished granite which support the roof. The dome is much too small for the size of the edifice, and the interior of the church is somewhat narrow. The rails of the altar, which are handsome and massive, are of solid silver. At the lower end of the church are a number of flags taken from the Persians, the French, and other nations ; and against one of the pillars are suspended the keys of various captured fortresses, with brass plates, giving the name of each. Marshal Davoust's baton is also hung up in a conspicuous spot, in a glass cylinder, to protect it from injury. Throughout Petersburg are excellent flagged pavements for foot passengers ; but the ordinary pavement of the streets is execrable, the stones which compose it being of every possible shape and size. To fill up the orevices and give an apparent smoothness, a gritty sand is strewed in large quantities over the streets ; and as they never are watered, in spite of the facilities offered by the adjacent Neva and the various canals, the clouds of dust, or rather of fine gravel, with which the air is filled on 'a windy day, render it impossible to keep open one's eyes or to walk about in comfort. In most of the prin-"], [32, "[Let. II. 8 LONDON AND PETERSBURG. cipal streets, however, a wooden pavement has been intro duced, which, when new and good, is extremely pleasant to drive over. It is free from dust, and the motion of the car riage over it is smooth and easy ; but it is very expensive and by no means durable, not continuing more than two or three years in repair. It is moreover dangerous for horses in wet weather.* On Sunday we attended Divine service in the English church, which is very handsomely fitted up and liberally maintained by the British Factory. f The present chaplain is Mr. Law .J Here we were strongly reminded of \u00a9ur distance from home by the change in the calendar, since, as you are aware, the old style is still in use in Russia. Whereas, there fore, according to our reckoning, it was the twenty -fifth of July, we heard the thirteenth morning of the month announced from the reading-desk, and instead of having reached, as was the case in England, the fifth Sunday after Trinity, we found ourselves here thrust back to Trinity Sunday. There can hardly be a greater difference between two capitals, each splendid of its kind, than between London and St. Petersburg, and the contrast is especially striking when one is transported by sea, as we have been, in the short space of a week, from the banks of the* Thames to those of the Neva. Everything here looks fresh and new ; and the light-coloured stucco of the houses, the air free from smoke, and the bright, clear stream of the river, about as broad as the Thames, all contribute to give this city an outward character widety different from that of our own metropolis. In the population of the streets the distinction is not less broadly marked.

IL] EQUIPAGES \u2014 DROSCHKAS. 9 long blue caftan buttoned on the left side, with black boots over his trowsers, and both with thick beards which have never felt a razor, are national figures which present them selves here at every step. The equipages also at Petersburg are, for the most part, quite unlike all that one has seen else where. The private carriages, usually drawn by four long tailed horses, the wheelers being driven by a bearded coach man, and the leaders, with enormously long traces fastened to the pole, being managed by a boy mounted on the off horse. Coachman and postilion are each dressed in a caftan or wrapper without a collar, fastened by a gay sash round the waist, and they wear a low-crowned hat of a peculiar shape ; the coachman being adorned, if possible, by a handsome beard. The whole is frequently turned out in a wretched style ; but the four horses keep up the dignity of the equipage. Many handsome carriages are indeed built at Petersburg, and many fine horses are to be met with ; but it is to be remembered that at this season the court is out of town, and that most fashionable people have followed its example. There are plenty of vehicles, both open and close, plying for hire in the streets ; but as the fares are not regulated by authority, it is necessary always to make a bargain befoie engaging one. The hach-cab of Petersburg is the droschka, a very primitive vehicle, consisting merely of a bench about five feet long, covered by a cushion, mounted on four low wheels, and hung on C springs. The driver sits astride in front, resting his feet on an iron bar which projects on each side, over the fore axletree, and the passenger sits in a similar way behind, with a low back to lean against, and with his feet on the steps on either side, protected from the mud only by splashing boards over the wheels. If there is a second pas senger, he sits sideways in the middle of the droschka. It is but an uncomfortable conveyance, since the passenger is entirely exposed to the weather, and the position of sitting astride on a bench is not agreeable. There are, however, plenty of private droschkas to be seen, very neat and convenient little carriages for fine weather. They are, indeed, much like a pony phaeton, with a seat in front for the driver, and they are very easy, being hung upon C springs. Sometimes these"], [34, "[Let. II. 10 SUMMER GARDEN. vehicles are drawn by a pair of horses with a pole ; but in general, like the hack-droschkas, they have shafts and are drawn by one horse, with his head borne up very high, a wooden arch resting on the ends of the shafts, and standing up over his head, with a ring at the highest part, to which the bearing-rein is attached. No carriage, waggon, or other ve hicle with shafts is seen in Russia without this arch, which is called a douga. An outrigger is frequently harnessed on the near side of the shaft-horse, without a bearing-rein, but with his head, on the contrary, drawn down almost to the ground, and turned outwards, as if he were flying away from the shafts. In this form he is made to canter and prance through the streets, while his companion trots steadily along. To droschkas occasionally, and to heavier carriages often, a third horse is harnessed in like manner on the opposite side. This team of three horses, which is exceedingly handsome, is called a troika. The Russians always drive with snaffle bits and without blinkers ; * bearing-reins being never used except for horses in shafts. The canals which run through Petersburg, as well as the sides of the Neva, are crowded with large clumsy barges, loaded with wood for winter consumption, and cut up into logs ready for use. Good-sized hay-stacks, thatched over, may also be seen apparently floating by themselves upon the river ; a second glance, however, showing that the foundation is a low barge, almost entirely covered and concealed by the mass with which it is loaded. We have visited the Summer Garden, the principal public promenade of Petersburg. The garden has little beauty to boast of, but it is thickly planted with trees, and it, at least, offers abundance of shade. The walks are laid out in straight lines, and are adorned by marble busts and statues ; but the prin- * From subsequent observation, it appears to me that the vice of kicking in harness is much less common with Russian horses than with English, though, from the manner in which the former are often harnessed, and the slight pains which are bestowed on breaking them in, the contrary might have been expected. The reason I take to be, that the Russian horse has the use of his eyes, while the English horse imagines an iuvisible enemy in every loose straw or other harmless object which touches him unexpectedly. No people habitually drive so fast as Russians."], [35, "Let. IL] ISLANDS OF THE NEVA. 11 cipal ornament is the celebrated palisade facing the river, which is exceedingly fine. The Russians have a myth of an English man who came to Petersburg on purpose to see this palisade, and who rowed up the river to it, gazed at it, and, having gratified his curiosity, returned home without having set foot on Russian soil. Though not quite worthy of so long a pil grimage as this gentleman is supposed to have taken, it is a most beautiful work. We drove, one lovely evening, through the islands formed by the different branches of the Neva, and crowded with pretty villas and gardens, which in this hot weather look exceedingly cool and tempting, but which are uninhabitable from damp, excepting in the height of summer. They, how ever, form at present a very gay and attractive scene as one drives among them, along a well-watered road, a luxury which, as I have already observed, the city itself does not furnish. One evening, about seven o'clock, we went out to walk, crossing the Isaac Bridge, and following the bank of the Neva on the other side up to the Exchange, and the scene, as we walked slowly along, was exquisitely beautiful. We were on the shady side of the river, while the light fell directly on the opposite side, \u2014 on the Admiralty, the Imperial Palace, and the other fine buildings which line the bank, as well as on the gay pleasure-boats which crowded the broad bright stream ; while facing us stood the well-known and splendid equestrian statue of Peter the Great on a granite rock as its pedestal. We could not help regretting that the ugly bridge of boats was not replaced by a structure worthy of the Neva and of the city which lay before us ; for the beauty of the river, enhanced as it is by the fine granite quays facing it on either side, leaves nothing but a handsome bridge to be desired. The construc tion of one has hitherto been prevented by the extreme depth of water, which renders it impossible to build piers. A chain bridge is talked of, but here also there are, it is said, some serious difficulties to overcome. We returned home by the garden adjoining the custom-house ; it is, however, remarkable for nothing but the immense numbers of birds of all sorts, from a parrot to a linnet, which are exposed here in cages for sale. We are much struck, in walking about Petersburg, with"], [36, "[Let. II. 12 HERMITAGE\u2014 WINTER PALACE. the small appearance there is of communication between the city and the country. Instead of the countless coaches, omni buses, and travelling carriages of London, a solitary diligence, or a rare carriage with the appendage of trunks and imperials, is all that meets the eye. We went yesterday to see the Hermitage, a friend having procured a ticket of admission for us. This palace is used as a picture gallery. Room after room is entirely covered with paintings, to examine which properly would require frequent visits for weeks together. The collection is fine, but there are no catalogues, at least none are placed in the hands of visitors, so that a stranger wanders on without knowing where to find the pictures most worthy of attention, a very serious drawback to his pleasure in so extensive a gallery. Besides the paintings, we saw some splendid vases of malachite, together with other works of art, as well as antiquities and curiosities. . From the Hermitage we passed into the Winter Palace,* which adjoins and communicates with it, and which is the town residence of the Imperial family. The Hall of St. George, in which the Emperor holds his courts, is a magnificent room, both in its proportions and its decorations. The White Hall, in which the court balls are given, is extremely beautiful, and when it is lighted up the effect must be most brilliant. Ad joining this hall is a smaller room, hung with crimson velvet, studded with the Imperial eagle, embossed in gold : this is used fur the reception of foreign ambassadors. A gallery, which opens into the Hall of St. George, is filled with portraits of all the Russian generals who served, with that rank, during the French war : they were all painted by an Englishman named Dawes. The execution is tolerable, and they are said to be in general good likenesses : Dawes received a thousand roubles, about forty pounds, for each. In another room are the portraits of Field-Marshals only \u2014 a rank of which the Emperor is extremely chary. Pie has at present but two, of whom one only is actually in his service, viz.

II.] THE MILITARY. 13 of Warsaw ; the other Russian Field-Marshal being the Duke of Wellington. Nothing can be more beautiful than are the private apartments in the AVinter Palace : the decorations, which are chiefly in white and gold, are not only extremely rich, but in admirable taste. Gilding of every kind, and the imitation of marble, especially white marble, are arts carried to a high degree of perfection in Russia; and the splendid plate-glass windows complete the beauty of the rooms. The last room which we were shown amused us much, being the play-room in winter of the young Grand Duke Constantine, who is now eleven or twelve years of age. It is full of ingenious and pretty inventions for the amusement of the young prince. There are diminutive carriages and droschkas, sledges upon concealed castors, so as to run on the floor ; a boat with a mechanical contrivance, so that a boy may row himself about the room in it; and a ship fully rigged, with a mast large enough to climb. There is also a slide of polished wood, in imitation of an ice-hill, and in one comer stands a little guard house for playing at soldiers.* In short, this room, with all its contents, is a perfect little-boy's paradise, and a very amusing sight to grown-up pieople. To an English eye, nothing perhaps at Petersburg is moi _ striking than the number of military in the streets. The usual force quartered in and about the city amounts, I believe, to sixty thousand men ; but at this time the greater part of them are absent, being encamped twenty or thirty miles off for training and man\u0153uvres ; yet even now cocked hats, plumes, and uniforms encounter us at every step. We were at first somewhat surprised, in this hot weather, to see the soldiers always buttoned up in their great-coats,f and the officers wrapped in their cloaks. The former, however, thereby save their jackets, which they leave at home, and the latter are obliged to wear a cloak in the streets as a protection to the uniform, which would otherwise be very soon spoiled in this * Eighteen years later\u2014 in 1855\u2014 we have had experience that \" the boy was father of the man,\" and that the tastes of the Grand Duke have been developed with his growth, but not changed. t The grey great-coat, which rendered it so difficult for the English troops, fighting in their great-coats, at Inkerman, to distinguish friend from foe."], [38, "14 UNIFORMS \u2014 PUBLIC BUILDINGS.

Indeed they say that to do so is a necessary precaution, owing to the sudden changes from heat to cold which are experienced in this climate. Ladies walk about, even in this weather, enveloped in shawls and cloaks ; and the peasants are always seen in their shbobs* or coats of sheepskin, with the wool inside. No soldier or officer, so long as he continues in the Emperor's service, even when he is on leave of absence or with his own family in the country, is allowed to appear on any occasion out of uniform.! The officers, when they retire from the service, if they have been well conducted, generally receive permission to wear the uniform of their regiment when they please, but without epaulettes. The persons employed in the civil service of the empire, in the public offices, the universities and insti tutions of every kind, including lawyers, doctors, and pro fessors, have also uniforms, which, however, they are only obliged to wear when on duty. The undress is merely a plain coat of blue or green, with gilt buttons bearing a device. The full dress is worn with a sword, and much resembles a military uniform without epaulettes ; it is completed by white breeches, shoes, and buckles, and a cocked hat. I must observe that a Russian has no idea of a member of any profession, however independent it may be according to our notions, being other wise than \" in the service.\" I should suppose that in no other city of its size are there so many public buildings as in St. Petersburg.

You will be glad to see by the date of this letter that we have reached the place of our destination for the present, and that we are fairly established as visitors in a Russian country house. We are now in the province or government of Tver, and about four hundred miles south of Petersburg. In my last letter I told you we were anxious to start on our journey, but that no Diligence was to be had, and we were detained for two days longer, making frequent but fruitless inquiries at all the offices. On the evening of the 30th, however, as I was return ing home after an unsuccessful search, I fortunately spied the object of which 1 was in quest, namely, a Diligence for four persons, passing slowly along through the street. My servant, who was with me as interpreter, ascertained that it had just arrived from Moscow, and, having set down its passengers, was proceeding to the office. To this place I lost no time in making my way, and at once engaged the Diligence, which I was told would be ready to start, if I chose, in two hours : I, however, preferred setting out in the morning. Though we were only going as far as Torjok, which is but five hundred versts, we were obliged to pay for the Diligence all the way to Moscow, two hundred versts further. The price was three hundred and eighty roubles, somewhat more than sixteen pounds. A Russian verst is about three-quarters of a mile : and the rouble, if in coin, is worth about ten pence ; if assignat, i. e. in paper, about ten pence halfpenny. In all payments the former is understood, unless the contrary be ex plicitly stated, and the rouble may in general be considered"], [41, "Let. III.] CROWN INNS. 17 as equivalent to a French franc* The expense of engaging a diligence between Petersburg and Moscow is considerably more than that of posting, and the additional cost was still greater for us, since we were only conveyed about two-thirds of the distance, while we had to pay for the whole. For strangers, however, who arrive in Russia without any carriage of their own, it is very convenient to travel in this manner. The vehicle having been brought over-night into the yard of our lodgings, for the convenience of packing the luggage, by nine o'clock in the morning of the 1st everything was leady. The conductor, who spoke a little French, arrived ; four horses abreast were put to, and we started on our journey, having delivered to the conductor our passports, authorising us to leave St. Petersburg. After passing the barrier, where a handsome triumphal arch is in progress of erection, and will soon be finished, we found ourselves on an excellent mac adamized road, which is completed all the way to Moscow. The bridges are handsome and solid, being built of granite, with a cast-iron balustrade of an open pattern, exhibiting the Imperial eagle, with helmets, swords, fasces, &c. The new bridges are not yet all finished, but the deficiency is in every case supplied by a safe, temporary wooden bridge. At distances of from fifty to a hundred versts apart along this road, are handsome inns belonging to the crown, some of the apartments in them being reserved for the Imperial family, and only used for ordinary travellers in case of necessity. The innkeeper occupies the house on conditions which forbid his charging anything for the use of the rooms, which are kept always heated in winter : the traveller paying merely for what he orders, and the price of everything, from a cup of tea to a dinner, being fixed by a printed tariff in Russian, French, and German, which is hung up in every room. These inns are a comfort and accommodation, for which travellers are indebted to the liberality of the late Emperor Alexander, who built them to replace the palaces which were formerly kept up along this road, at a great expense, for the use of the Imperial family, * A few years after these letters were written, the silver rouble, worth about three shillings, was adopted, and still continues to be used as the standard of Russian currency, instead of the assignat rouble.

We travelled from eight to ten mdes an hour, and reached Torjok on the morning of the 3rd instant, after a journey of forty nine hours.

There is always a great deal of bargaining and disputing as to who is to go, among the peasants who keep the post-horses, and the question seems generally to be decided by lot. We frequently were driven by a lad of fifteen ; but they all seemed perfectly skilful in driving four-in-hand, though in a very different fashion from the team of an English coach. Our istvostchiks were, gene rally speaking, a gay, good-humoured set of people ; but one stage we had a very sulky fellow, who did not drive at all to the satisfaction of the conductor, who rated him, till at last the man, in rage, stopped, jumped down, and was proceeding to take off his horses, and leave us in the road. The con ductor, however, was soon at his back, threatening him with the police, and abusing him most violently ; hitting him all the time tolerably hard over the head with a thick leather pipe, till the istvostchik, whom I at first expected to return his blows, at length remounted the box and proceeded. The dress of the istvostchiks is that of the Russian peasant in general. They wear a shirt, usually red, made without a collar, and hanging outside' a pair of loose, trousers, or drawers, of blue linen or calico, which are tucked into a pair of boots reaching half way up the leg. The shirt is girded round the waist by a leather belt. Over this dress the Russian seldom thinks it too hot to wear his coat of sheep skin, with the wool inside ; this, however, he throws off when he enters a house. The hat is low crowned, with a lar\u00b0_ buckle to the band, and the crown projecting all round. Many of the istvostchiks adorn their hats with a peacock's"], [43, "Let. III.] NIGHT TRAVELLING. 19 feather twisted round them. The use of a razor is unknown among the peasants, and the rough, untrimmed beards, in the colour of which red is apt to preponderate, give the people a wdd, uncivilized appearance. The men wear the hair divided on the top of the head, and cut all round the neck like the edge of a bowl. They generally, when working, wear a band round the head to prevent the hair from falling into their eyes. The women as well as the men wear sheepskin coats and boots, and they generally tie a handkerchief round their heads, so as to conceal the hair \u2014 a most unfeminine and unbecoming attire. We travelled day and night without stopping, for we were anxious to make up for the time lost by our detention at Peters burg. Night journeying is, however, the ordinary practice in Russia, excepting for very weak and sickly people. Every one is accustomed to it, and post-horses are obtained by night as readily as by day. There is little accommodation for sleep ing at the inns ; and when it is necessary to rest on the road, as in the case of bad health, or of a very long journey, Rus sians always carry their own beds with them. In point of view we lost little by travelling in the dark, for nothing can be more dreary or monotonous than the greatest part of the road from Petersburg to Torjok. After the first ten or twelve versts we entered a tract of forest, which stretched with but few intervals for more than a hundred miles. The whole distance indeed exhibits little but a suc cession of bleak open country and thick forest. The road runs generally in a straight line, and one proceeds for miles to gether along a dead flat, without seeing a human habitation. On each side a boggy space of fifty or a hundred yards wide is kept clear of trees, and beyond that lies an impenetrable mass of birch and fir wood, growing up so thickly that the production of fine timber is impossible ; indeed I hardly saw a tree which appeared to be more than twenty or thirty years old. Here and there, where the trees had been cut down, was a neglected space full of grey stumps, and of long drawn-up saplings, bending or broken for want of their former support, many of them black and charred by fire ; while the general desolation of the scene was enhanced by heavy rain, which c 2"], [44, "NOVOGOROD. [Let. III. 20 fell almost incessantly.* A journey through these forests is like a sea- voyage; one spot resembling another so closely, that the traveller seems always to remain in the same place. The only part of the country through which we passed where the view is at all attractive is in the immediate neighbourhood of Valdai, a small town about two hundred versts from Torjok. Valdai stands on the edge of a handsome lake, in which is an island containing a monastery, and around the lake is some pretty broken ground covered with wood. The only two other towns of any consideration through which we passed were Novogorod and Vishny Volotchok. The former, though its name, if literally translated, would be simply New-Town, is one of the most ancient places in Russia. It is situated about two hundred versts from Petersburg, on a fine navigable river, the Volchova, over which is thrown a new and handsome stone bridge. The fortifications of Novogorod were in former times considered impregnable. The place sustained many a siege, but I believe that it retained to the last its reputation as a maiden fortress. There is in the town a ruined Kremlin, a name which seems to be generally applied to the fortified palace or citadel of a Tartar prince. A few miles south of Novogorod the road crosses a considerable river by a bridge of boats, which will soon be replaced by a solid structure of stone. Here, the last time M \u2014 was in Russia, travelling with her brother, she narrowly escaped a somewhat serious adventure. They were in an open caleche, and their istvostchik drove them, as these men usually do, at a gallop,! down upon the bridge, without perceiving that it was opened in the middle for a boat to pass. M \u2014 , however, instantly remarked the danger, and, pointing it out to her brother, they both called loudly to the driver to stop. This, at the pace they were going, was impossible, and carriage, horses, and passengers would inevitably have been pi -ecipitated into the river, had not the istvostchik contrived to run the * One night on our journey, as we were passing through this tract of forest, we saw a fire by the road-side and a number of horses standing with their tails to it ( like English fire- worshippers). The smoke no doubt drove away the mosquitos, and the fire kept the wolves at a respectful distance, but the fire-side effect was absurd enough. t A German driver always crosses a planked bridge or a bridge of boats at a foot's-pace, a Russian dashes across at full speed."], [45, "Let. III.] MILITARY COLONIES. 21 pole into a waggon-load of hay which was fortunately awaiting the closing of the bridge. On the road we met frequent droves of fine'! fat oxen on their way to Petersburg ; they were mostly of a dun colour, and came from Little Russia and the southern provinces. The cattle of the country through which we passed were invariably small and poor, and the sheep and pigs long-legged and ugly. The sheep are of all colours, black, brown, and speckled, but seldom white. An ordinary Russian village presents a dirty and cheerless aspect : but in some of those belonging to the crown, through which the high road passes, the wooden houses, especially when new, are very pretty and picturesque. They are built with a gable facing the street. Across the front runs a gallery with a neat balustrade, and the weather-boards are very handsome, being carved in open work like lace. The windows have almost all outside shutters, which are gaily painted with flowers, and similar ornaments, in bright colours. Near Novogorod is one of the military colonies established by the Emperor Alexander, who thus endeavoured, with doubt ful success, to make the same instrument both sword and sickle, spear and ploughshare. The results of the system remain to be seen, but the organ ization of an armed and disciplined peasantry is considered by niany to be an experiment which some day or other may prove hazardous to the tranquillity of the, empire. This colony has once already felt its strength in a most ferocious revolt, which, after a great part of the officers had been most cruelly put to death, was suppressed only by the presence and commanding firmness of the Emperor Nicholas in person. All that we saw in passing was a veiy long line of cottages lying parallel to the road. In the centre was a semicircular space, containing the church and the officers' houses. Behind lie the fields, which are tilled by these soldier-husbandmen. Torjok is famous for leather embroidered in gold and silver, and in various colours, for reticules, slippers, and belts. We were here to quit the Moscow road and the diligence, and we found that a coach and six, with another vehicle drawn by three horses, and called a tarantass, had been awaiting our"], [46, "[Let. III. 22 KRASNOE. arrival for some days. The tarantass was intended for our luggage ; but it is generally used for the conveyance of ser vants, and is, I believe, very common in Russia. This, however, being the first specimen of such a vehicle which I ever saw, struck me as singular from its novelty. The best picture which I can give of it is the body of an old cabriolet or small britschka, lashed on the middle part of a very light timber carriage. It has no springs ; but the elasticity of the long birch poles which connect the two axles, and on which the body is placed, renders the motion, as I am told, tolerably easy. After a breakfast which was preceded by the refreshment of a comfortable toilette at the inn where we stopped, we set out to perform the remaining part of our journey to this place, which is fifty versts, or about eight -and-thirty miles, from Tor jok. We now bade adieu with regret to the excellent mac adamized road, and enjoyed for the first time the luxury of an old-fashioned Russian road, not improved by two days of incessant rain. Over this road we travelled but slowly, in spite of our six horses, driven, according to custom, four abreast, with a pair of leaders, the postilion being mounted on the off-horse. We stopped once to bait ; and it was ten o'clock at night before we reached Krasnoe. Here we were most kindly welcomed and received by M \u2014 's father and all the family. Comfortable apartments, consisting of bed-room, dressing-room, and sitting room, had been prepared for us, and we were glad to enjoy a good night's rest after our journey. As we had arrived in the dark, we had seen nothing; of r \u00b0 Krasnoe as we approached, and I was curious next morn ing to inspect the place, though the weather continued rainy and disagreeable. The ground slopes down from the house to a large and handsome piece of water, and is laid out in the style of an English garden, with flower-beds, trees, shrubs, and grass ; and at the further extremity is a grove of handsome birch-trees, where the ground is intended to imitate a park. The whole, including the water, is very pretty, but the space is too extensive to be kept in per fect order as dress ground. At the same time, sheep and"], [47, "Let. III.] FARM-STOCK. 23 cattle are never admitted to graze as on an English lawn, so that the turf is coarse and bad. The architecture of the church, which is close to the house, is considered remarkable, as being a species of Gothic, a style uncommon in Russia. It was built in imitation of a church erected by the Empress Catherine, to commemorate an action in the Black Sea, when the Russians burned the Turkish fleet ; and it has five domes, all sur mounted by the Greek cross placed over the crescent.* This edifice was erected by an ancestress of M \u2014 's, a lady who built no less than twelve churches in the government of Tver, and who was rather a remarkable personage. She in herited a large fortune, and was married at the age of fifteen. She had twenty-three children, of whom ten came to years of maturity : she survived her husband many years, and was nearly ninety years old when she died. After her husband's death, if not during his lifetime, she was sole mistress of his property, which she increased tdl she accumulated an immense fortune by extraordinary energies and talents for business ; and she died, leaving large estates to each of seven sons and thi ee daughters. The second day of our visit brought a decided improvement in the weather, and I had a drive with my father-in-law after break fast, in a low phaeton, to see a little of his estate, which con sists of apparently sound good land, chiefly arable. The grass land will not bear a comparison with English pasture ; and the crops of hay are very light, though they are here considered particularly good this year. The horses, sheep, pigs, and horned cattle which compose the live stock, are small, and of a very inferior kind ; but I am told that the expense of im proving them by a mixture of foreign breeds is very much dis proportioned to the profit thereby derived. The animals of every kind are necessarily housed at night, even in summer, on account of the wolves, which are very numerous and trouble some in this neighbourhood. In the morning the whole of the stock goes out to feed, and remains during the clay under the pro tection of a herdsman, whose badge of office is a whip, which he carries over his shoulder, with a short handle, and a long heavy * This significant emblem is very common in Russia, as I afterwards observed."], [48, "PEASANTS' DWELLINGS. [Let. III. 24 lash trailing for several feet along the ground behind him. \"With this implement he soon reduces to order, and brings back to the herd, any refractory animal which is inclined to stray ; the want of fences rendering his constant attendance necessary. There is an abundance of water and wood, birch, and Scotch and spruce fir, both for fuel and for ordinary uses, on the estate, which also contains lime and brick earth. The peasants live entirely in villages, of which at Krasnoe there are four ; the mansion-house, with its appendages, form ing a part of the largest. This is, I believe, a universal cus tom in Russia, where solitary houses are rarely seen. The roofs are covered either with thatch, boards, thin sheets of iron, or guttered tiles, as slates are unknown ; the most usual, be cause the cheapest covering for the peasants' houses, being a slovenly thatch. These houses are, however, in general, ex tremely warm and substantial. They are built for the most part of unsquared logs of deal, laid one upon another, and firmly secured at the comers, where the ends of the timbers cross, being hollowed out so as to receive and hold one another. These timbers are also fastened together by wooden pius and uprights in the interior. The four corners are sup ported upon large stones or roots of trees, so that there is a current of air in summer under the floor to preserve the tim ber from damp ; while in the winter earth is piled up all round to exclude the cold. The interstices between the hori zontal logs are stuffed with moss and clay, so that no air can enter. The windows are very small, and are frequently cut out of the wooden wall after it is finished. In the centre of the house is a stove called a peech, which heats the cottage to an almost unbearable degree. The warmth, however, which a Russian peasant loves to enjoy within doors is proportioned to the cold which he is required to endure without. His bed is the top of his peech; and when he enters his house in the winter, pierced with cold, he throws off his sheepskin coat, stretches himself on his stove, and is thoroughly warmed in a few minutes. There are two important appendages to the village of Kras noe, which must be mentioned, viz. the hospital for the peasants, and the bath."], [49, "Let. III.] THE VAPOUR-BATH. 25 The former is under the superintendence of a German doctor, who lives in the house, being engaged at a fixed stipend. This provision for the proper attendance of their people when sick is an act of humanity which, I believe, the proprietors of few estates in this country neglect if they can aflbrd it. The Russian bath is indispensable in every village; and there is scarcely a servant or peasant of either sex, whether young or old, who does not use it every Saturday in the year. You are aware that it is a vapour-bath. A room containing a stove is furnished with benches rising like steps one behind the other to the roof : stones are heated on the stove, and water is poured upon them, so as to fill the room, which is carefully closed, with steam. The bather commences by placing him self on the lowest bench, and gradually ascends till he reaches the highest, where the heat is greatest. He also promotes the circulation of the blood, and increases the action of the heat upon his skin, by flapping himself all over with small birch twigs. He will often rush out of the bath when at the hottest, plunge into cold water, or even roll in the snow, and return. This weekly purification of the person must tend greatly to the health of the Russian peasant, whose long hair and beard, and sheeriskin coat, are not favourable to personal cleanliness."], [50, "COUNTRY LIFE.

Krasnoe, August 10th, 1837. We have now been here nearly six weeks, though I can scarcely persuade myself of the fact, so quickly and agreeably has the time flown by. Our life, however, has been extremely quiet and regular. We breakfast about nine, or half-past, after which M \u2014 and I retire to our own sitting-room, where we usually occupy ourselves till two o'clock, when we all assemble for dinner. After dinner some of the ladies visit our room to work, talk, and read ; towards five we think of going out to walk, ride, drive, or row; at seven we have tea, after which we go out again, and often come in but just in time for supper at ten or half-past ten. We have a boat somewhat less than a barge, which I pull, often with three or four passengers on board, and, considering her tonnage, she goes wonderfully well. The lake, which has been formed by damming up the waters of two brooks flowing into one another, stretches up a hollow to a considerable extent ; and as we can penetrate both of the little rivers for some distance, we can easily enjoy a pull of an hour and a half or two hours. Besides the members of the family and ourselves, we have also, as inmates of the house, a German doctor and his wife. This gentleman, as I have already mentioned, is engaged to attend the family and the peasants in sickness. There is also a little orphan girl, noble, but penniless, whom M \u2014 's sisters educate, according to a charitable custom extremely prevalent in Russia. I have not made much progress in the Russian language, beyond acquiring the names of a few articles of every-day use. Indeed, strangers, who merely intend to pass a short"], [51, "Let. IV.] RUSSIAN PATRONYMICS. 27 time in the country, have little inducement to bestow much labour upon this study, for all Russians of the educated classes speak French, with as much facility in general as their native tongue, and many of them use it almost as much in talking to one another, even when no foreigners are present. The Russian language, however, it is said, is rapidly gaining ground in fashionable society, owing to the encouragement of the Emperor, who very wisely will not allow himself to be addressed by his subjects in any other, and who is highly displeased when it is spoken or written incorrectly. One cause for the general habit of talking French, probably, is the want of bells, and the practice of having servants constantly in the ante-rooms close at hand, and within hearing of the conversation. The important precept so carefully instilled into English children, always to shut the door after them, is un known in Russia. The Russians have no words, at least none are commonly used, which correspond to Mr., Mrs., or Miss ; and in speaking of or to one another, in their own language, they use the christian name, subjoining that of the person's father with the termination added \u2014 mitch or mitch, son of, and ovna or evna, daughter of. Thus John son of Peter is called Ivan Petro vitch, and Anne daughter of John is Anna Ivanovna. In this manner, without any title of respect, the servant addresses his master or mistress, and the soldier his officer. One of the first points, accordingly, which it became necessary to settle on our arrival here, was the providing us with suitable Rus sian patronymics for the benefit of the servants. M \u2014 be came quite naturally Maria Alexandiw na ; and, after some consideration, I received the euphonious name of Rodivon Rodivonovitch. The ordinary routine of life which I have described has been varied now and then by an occasional visit. The system of country visiting in Russia is carried on upon the hospitable principle that a friend is always welcome. The distances are so great, that morning calls are in general out of the ques tion, and, excepting on particular occasions, such as a fete, invitations are rare. Neighbours sometimes send over to announce their intention of coming, if it is agreeable to you, to"], [52, "[Let. IV. 28 COUNTRY VISITING. dine, or to spend a night or two at your house ; but there being no cross-posts between country places, the most usual thing is, that your guests arrive unexpectedly a little before the ordinary dinner-hour. This system has its inconveniences, though it is unavoidable in Russia, where, besides the diffi culty of writing beforehand to prepare you for their visit, people do not always like to pledge themselves to go twenty or five-and-twenty miles, over bad roads, with the chance that the day fixed for the visit may prove rainy or disagreeable. These unexpected visits are considered highly complimentary, though, from the quantity of servants and horses with which Russians travel, the numbers to be provided for impromptu are sometimes rather formidable. For instance, on one occasion, when three parties chanced to arrive here simultaneously to dine, and spend a day or two, unannourfced beforehand ; though the guests themselves amounted only to five or six, they brought with them ten servants, and sixteen carriage-horses. A single man seldom moves with less than two servants and four horses, and the Russian country-house has no neighbouring inn to which the latter may be inhospitably consigned. The etiquette of visiting, in general, is altogether different in this country and in England. With us, it is considered the part of the person of higher rank, or of older standing in so ciety, to make the first advances in forming an acquaintance ; whereas in Russia it rests with the new comer to select his society among those to whom he is introduced, and he calls upon those whom he desires to know. Among our other guests were a lady and gentleman named Velikopolsky. Though they live thirty versts, or about three and-twenty miles hence, they are looked upon as neighbours, and, in fact, they merely came to dinner, and went home again in the evening \u2014 with their footman, by-the-by, standing up behind the carriage, as if they were driving about town. This, however, it seems, is considered no hardship by a Russian servant, especially if the foot-board be upon springs. When tired of standing, he sits down with his back to the carriage, and in this way he will travel any distance. The Velikopolskys, on taking leave, pressed us much to pay them a visit, which we accordingly did the following"], [53, "Let. IV.] A DINNER VISIT. 29 week, sending a messenger a day beforehand to announce our intention. As the distance was long, we set off about eleven o'clock, and traversed an open country, for the most part over unmade roads, like the tracks across an English common. In about two hours we descended a very steep hill, at the foot of which flowed the Volga. This point is about ninety miles from the source of the river, and it is already a fine stream about two hundred yards wide, with a rapid current deep and clear, run ning in a narrow valley, which it appears to have cut for itself through the surrounding plain. We crossed the celebrated river on a floating bridge, and after ascending the steep hdl on its fur ther bank, and regaining the level country, we soon found our selves at the place of our destination, the house standing on a fine elevated spot above the Volga. The windows were, however, turned away from the river, and they presented no view but that of a formal old-fashioned garden, filled with lime-trees closely trimmed, and planted in straight lines on each side of the walks. After going round the garden we returned to the house, where we found a dejeuner set out in the drawing room, consisting of caviare, cheese, &c, and liqueurs. This was tasted and dinner was immediately announced, it being now three o'clock. In the middle of dinner some English bottled porter was handed round, and considerable amusement was excited by my declining the offered improvements of lemon and pounded sugar, which the Russians often drink with por- ter, and which our kind host had supposed indispensable to an Englishman.* After dinner we took a short walk, and on our return found a dessert of fruit laid out in a pretty balcony filled with flowers, upon which the drawing-room windows opened. This was followed by music and singing, till, at half- past six, tea made its appearance, accompanied by ices. Im- mediately afterwards we took our departure, and got back to Krasnoe at ten o'clock, having paid a visit of five hours, to accomplish which we had travelled nearly fifty miles with the same horses over very indifferent roads. A week ago we were invited to a village fete, about four- * We afterwards found incidentally that a messenger had been sent to a town nearly twenty miles off, to procure the lemons supposed to be so essential to the English palate."], [54, "VILLAGE FETE. 30 [Let.

We reached Triiitska about one o'clock, and found in front of the house a long row of tables, at which all the peasants on the estate, with their wives and children, had just finished dining. They had been well provided with beer, followed by a glass or two of spirits to each ; and they were now assembled round the door of the house, shouting and singing with all their might. On the steps of the house were large baskets full of gingerbread, which the entertainer and his guests were throwing in every direction among the crowd, and the peasants, men and women, boys and girls, were scrambling for it with the utmost eagerness. After the scrambling was over, we were entertained by a national dance, the execution of which had no great merit, especially as some of the performers were drunk. The music was a monotonous ditty, sung, or rather screeched, at the pitch of their voices by the dancers themselves. We soon afterwards sat down to dinner, and the singing was con tinued under the windows by four or five pairs of vigorous female lungs during the whole time that we were at table. The swing, that most necessary appendage to all Russian country festivities, which is to be seen in every village and in every gentleman's garden, was kept in full play, till the peasants got tired of amusing themselves, and went home to their houses. About six o'clock we drove to see a neighbour ing gentleman's garden, which was somewhat celebrated in the country. The proprietor received us most civilly, and showed us over his garden, which was his hobby. It was large and well kept, but for the most part dull and sombre, being laid out chiefly in straight walks, entirely shaded over by trees, which, however, were old and of a considerable size, so as to impart a degree of respectability to the place. The garden was decorated by large formally shaped ponds ; at one end was a stew filled with pike, and, close by, a tawdry summer-house of painted wood. We returned to Troitska to tea, and drove home in the cool of the evening, or rather in the dark. On the following day (August 5) a degree of heat set in"], [55, "Let. IV.] AN ENTHUSIAST. 31 such as I never remember to have felt before. Its continu ance was fortunately not very long, for on the 8th (the day before yesterday) we had a thunderstorm, which cooled the air, and the heat is now moderated. During the three days, however, of its intensity, it was impossible to stir out of the house till seven o'clock in the evening. I had a headache during the whole time, and sat all day absolutely gasping for breath, unable to find a cool spot. It was well for us that the clays were not at the longest, and that the power of the sun was therefore somewhat diminished. The summer has been considered on the whole a very cold one in this country, where heat, such as we have just experienced, sometimes lasts uninterruptedly for weeks, bringing all the crops rapidly to perfection, and compensating by its intensity for the short ness of a Russian summer. A few years ago, so great was the drought and heat in this neighbourhood, that the grass was scorched, the earth smoked if turned up, and the forests in many places took fire from the dryness of the trees. A man was lately brought back to Krasnoe by the police, who had run away from his wife seven years ago. .\\'hen he was asked his reason for absconding, he said that he had been compelled by his family to marry when very young, that he thought it wicked to have a wife, and that his greatest desire was to become a monk. Since his return, he has thrown himself at the feet of the young ladies whenever he could meet with them, intreating them to intercede with their father to permit him to enter a convent. This, however, will not be allowed, for fear of the example being followed. This man has been to the monastery of Solovetskoi, situated on a small island in the 'White Sea, in a dreadful climate, and fre quently cut off from all communication with the main land. Here this poor man wished to have remained, and to have entered the order, the rules of which are most severe ; but as he had no passport or permission from his master to show, the monks were prohibited by law from admitting him. When he arrived here he was examined, and it was found that he had on an iron belt next to his skin around his breast, sup ported by iron straps over his shoulders, and with two iron"], [56, "32 A RUNAWAY SERF.

He had put it on by way of penance for having de serted his family, and he begged earnestly that it might not be taken off. This, however, was done ; and when he was afterwards asked if he should wish it to be given back to him, he said, \" No ; that there would be no merit in wearing it now, since everybody knew of it.\" As he was not per mitted to become a monk, his next request was, that he might be appointed to tend the cattle and sheep in the field, in order that he might not be shocked by the language and pro fane songs of the other peasants. This request was complied with, but I cannot say whether he has become reconciled to his situation. He is a singular, but at the same time evidently a very sincere enthusiast. The conversation about this poor man has naturally pro duced a variety of stories bearing a resemblance more or less to his case. The following is one of these anecdotes. Some years ago a peasant named Peter ran away from Krasnoe, and was not heard of for three years, when one day a man was brought to the village by the police as the runaway. Some doubt was expressed by various people as to the identity of the new comer, but he insisted that he was Peter. The fact was confirmed by his wife and his father, as well as by others who had known him formerly, and the point was at last admitted. The man lived at home with his wife for about a fortnight, but he behaved so ill, that it was deter mined to make a soldier of him, \u2014 a most terrible punishment in the eyes of a Russian peasant. Before, however, the threat could be carried into effect, the man again absconded, and was not seen for about a month, when he had the impudence to appear at Krasnoe at a village feast, to share in the amuse ments of the day. In the mean time his real character had been discovered, namely, that he was a deserter from the army, who had become acquainted with a brother of the run away peasant in prison, where he had learned some parti culars of his history, with the addition that he was in person"], [57, "Let.

When, therefore, he appeared at the feast he was immediately apprehended, and the next morning sent off to prison. He, however, said he had escaped out of gaol a dozen times before, and should do so again. 'Whether he kept his word I do not know ; but it is a sin gular fact that the true Peter returned home the same night that the impostor was conveyed to prison.

The ceremony on the 1st of August is in commemoration of the death of the Virgin Mary, and a fast of fourteen days commences with the month. About ten o'clock in the morning, at the conclusion of mass in the church, the priest, followed by the congregation, came down to the piece of water below the garden. He himself bore the cross, while two banners belonging to the church, adorned with sacred devices, were also cariied at the head of the procession. A service was then performed : that part of the fifth chapter of St. John which relates to the pool of Bethesda, being read as a lesson ; and the priest, standing upon a small platform, reverentially dipped the cross three times in the lake, after which he sprinkled the people around with the water thus consecrated, and the procession then returned to the church. The greater part of the people, how ever, remained at the edge of the water, which, from their proceedings, might have been supposed to be now endowed with the miraculous virtues of the pool of Bethesda. Horses were brought down from every side, and compelled to swim in the lake. Women dipped their babies in the water. Young men, girls, and boys dashed in, and swam about in every"], [59, "Let. V.] VISIT TO GROUZINE. 35 direction, all, except a few little children, retaining their clothes. The girls appeared to swim quite as well as the boys. The day was luckily bright and fine for the exhibition of this singular scene. On the 14th we went to spend two or three days at Grou zine, a place some thirty miles hence, belonging to an uncle of 51 \u2014 's, General Constantine Poltoratzky, from a second visit to whom we only returned two days ago. Constantine Mar kitch \u2014 as he is called \u2014 is one of the most agreeable men I ever met with, and I can readily believe he is universally popular. His lady and his son were old acquaintances, as we had dined with them in Petersburg a few days after our arrival. The former was a Princess Galitzin, and is descended, through her mother, from the kings of Georgia, her great grandfather having been the last who sat upon the throne from which he was driven by the Russians. His son, Madame Poltoratzky's grandfather, attempted to regain his crown, but was overcome and thrown into prison, where he died, and his grandson, her uncle, enjoys the empty title of Prince of Georgia, with large estates in Russia, given to the family in lieu of their lost dominions.* The house is large and handsome, and the garden upon which it looks is extensive and well laid out, with a piece of water running through it. Here we spent two days much as the}' might have been spent in a large English country-house, except that we dined at four and supped at eleven. The whole establishment is on a very handsome footing, with all appliances for making a visit in the house agreeable. Nothing could exceed the kindness of our reception ; we repeated our visit the following week, and before we came away we pro mised our host and hostess, after we leave Krasnoe, to spend a short time with them at Yaroslav, of which province the General is Governor. * (Note to Second Edition.\") \u2014 \"No other princely family can trace back its genealogy to the ninth century of our era ; the Bagratides occupied the Georgian throne, in one unbroken line, from the sixth century. ... At the beginning of this century they resigned the throne in favour of Russia, and now reside chiefly at Moscow or St. Petersburg, where they retain the semblance of royal honours.\" \u2014 Baron von Haxthausen's ' Transcaucasia,\" chap. iv. D 2"], [60, "[Let. V. 36 VISIT TO VELMOGIE. On the 23rd we went to visit another uncle, about sixty miles hence, at a place called Velmogie. We travelled all the way with the same horses. The road was exceedingly bad, and when we reached our journey's end we found we had, from ignorance of the route, made a detour of seven or eight miles. That we had done so was not wonderful, as villages were few and far between, and our road was, in some places, a mere turf track through brushwood. At one spot, where we had to cross a small river, we found the bridge out of repair, no parapets, and only a road over it just wide enough for the wheels to pass. Russian coachmen, however, manage to drive heavy carriages through roads and over places which we in England should consider impracticable for wheels, and we met with no disasters. Being obliged to bait the horses on the road, we stopped at a village about half-way, and in default of an inn we put our horses in the priest's stable, and bought from him hay and corn. Our luncheon, which we had brought with us, we ate in the carriage, to avoid taking meat into a priest's house during a fast. The morning after our arrival at Velmogie we found our windows looking out upon ornamental ground, laid out in excellent taste. The garden was pretty, the trees and shrubs judiciously planted, and there was a handsome piece of water which had the effect of a river. The chief fault was the error common in this country of having more grass than can be kept neat and well mown. The great beauty of the place, however, arose from the ornamental ground extending beyond the garden, which in Russia is rarely seen. The view from the house is bounded by a natural bank, which lies covered with wood in a very happy position, so as to shut out a bare and ugly tract of country, while it encloses between itself and the garden a very pretty sweep of cultivated land. This bank is laid out in walks, and at the end of it, on a small elevation above the water, is built, among the trees, a small Grecian temple, which contains a family monument, and which forms a very hand some point of view from the house. The kitchen-garden and hot-house abounded in fruit; gooseberries and currants, of which the crop was enormous, raspberries and strawberries, besides cherries, which were very fine, grapes, melons, and"], [61, "Let V.] GREYHOUNDS AND HARRIERS. 37 water-melons. This latter fruit, so seldom seen in England, is grown in great quantities in Russia. Water-melons are always put, for some time before they are to be used, into the ice cellar, and are brought to table as cold as possible, when they are excellent. Cherry-trees, at least those of choice sorts, are always planted in a house (without glass), the roof of which is taken off in summer, and put on again before winter, to pro tect the trees from the frost. Even with this precaution, however, they often perish in a winter more than ordinarily severe. Ice is a good thing, of which for a great part of the year Russia certainly enjoys rather a superfluity ; but the abund ance of it in summer is a very great luxury. Instead of being taken, as in England, from any stagnant pond, and then pounded into a mass, the ice is here selected from the purest water, and placed in solid blocks in the cellar, so that it is perfectly bright and clean.* It is not only used to ice butter, water, wine, &c, but plates full of it, in small lumps, for putting into one's glass at dinner, always appear at table. The ice-cellar answers the purpose of a larder, and even forms an appendage to every peasant's house. Our host after breakfast invited me to see his kennel, where he had nine or ten couples of harriers and five or six brace of greyhounds, and he kindly proposed to take them out for my amusement the following morning, although the corn was in general standing, and the sporting season had not yet com menced; however, I was curious to see how Russians hunted, and it was settled that we should go out the next morning at five, if it did not rain. The greyhounds were really magnificent animals, exceed ingly tall, and altogether much larger and more powerful than any I ever saw before ; their ears were silky, their coats long and waving, and their tails bushy like those of setters. Two of them are indeed a match for a wolf; and a brace of those which I now saw had the previous year coursed and killed one unassisted, the wolf having unhappily for himself crossed their path when the}' were on a journey. My kind host had pro- * Wenliam Lake ice was at that time unknown in England."], [62, "38 WOLF-HUNTING. [Let. V. mised before my arrival to arrange, if possible, a wolf-hunt against the time of my visit. For this purpose, however, it is necessary to collect a great number of peasants to drive the woods in a line, and the harvest having now begun, and the peasants being busy, the project unfortunately fell to the ground. I should have much liked to see a hunt of this kind. Wolves abound in this country,* but it is difficult to find them, as they are very shy and cunning, and, hearing hounds at a great distance, they will seldom await their ap proach. Hounds can rarely run clown a wolf, owing to his powers of endurance, but, his back-bone being very inflexible, he is unable to turn quickly or in a small space, while he cannot match a greyhound in speed. For this reason, when once found, he is easily caught and mastered by greyhounds if they understand their business, and seize him by the throat and not by the loins. He can then neither avoid them by doubling like a hare, nor turn suddenly upon them in defence. To return to the subject of our visit : some neighbours arrived to dinner, which was laid out, the day being warm and pleasant, under a large lime-tree in the garden. Among the guests were a lady and gentleman named Luvoff, con nexions of the family, who invited us to dine with them as we returned home, which we accordingly did, their house lying near the road. It looks over an extent of woodland which reminded me of an English park. Madame Luvoff and her family have a great talent for working in wax, of which in her house we saw two beautiful specimens, a Mameluke on horse back, and a Magdalen in a cave. We were told also that a sledge with two horses moulded in wax, which we had seen at Petersburg in the Hermitage, and the extreme beauty and delicacy of which had excited our admiration, was the work of this lady's mother. On the morning after our al fresco dinner I woke early and looked out, but as it was pouring with rain, and there seemed every probabdity of the bad weather continuing, I gave up all * In proof of which, eighteen animals have lately, though it is summer, been destroyed by wolves on the Krasnoe estate; and the peasants of a neighbouring village, returning home late from their work a few nights ago, saw no less than eight wolves together near the road."], [63, "Let. V.] HARE-HUNT. 39 idea of our projected sport, and went quietly to sleep again. However, about six o'clock, finding the rain had ceased, I got up, and before I was dressed I was told the master of the house was ready, and after a slight breakfast we set out together. He was equipped in a great-coat with a spencer over it, and a red comforter round his neck. He wore a pair of very loose black velveteen trousers, lined down the parts which press the saddle with black leather like a dragoon's, and strong water-proof boots without spurs. A cloth cap completed his attire. The black velveteen trousers are, I am told, conmionly worn for hunting in Russia over another pair, and they are not bad things for wet and cold. I was mounted on a rough unpromising-looking horse, which however belied his appearance, and proved to be in reality a good one. I found indeed that he was of the well-known breed of the Don Cossacks. They are famous for action and endurance, though coarse-looking and small. We had four piqueurs, as I suppose I must call them, dressed in military-shaped frock-coats of blue cloth, edged round with gold-coloured lace, blue trousers, and caps of orange-coloured cloth, with broad black velvet bands; there was also a fifth man, who was, I believe, a valet-de-chambre, and who was dressed somewhat differently. All these were mounted on small active horses of the same description as mine. Three of them wore short swords, and had horns slung over their shoulders. Two managed the greyhounds, and the other three hunted the hounds, for the sport was a combination of hunting and coursing ; the object being that the hounds should find hares in the covers and drive them into the open ground to be coursed by the greyhounds. In this manner they sometimes kill twenty in a day ; they also kill foxes, and occasionally a wolf ; the latter, however, as I have already said, is in general difficult to meet with. We threw off among some bushes flanking and connecting two small woods. The hounds were uncoupled amidst a din of whips cracking, horns blowing, and men hallooing. In short, all pains were apparently taken to excite the pack to the highest possible pitch of wildness, and certainly not with out success. Away they went into cover full cry. \" That is"], [64, "[Let. V. 40 HARE-HUNT. no hare,\" quietly remarked my companion, \"it is only their joy at getting loose.\" The joy, however, was not easily sub dued, and their cry continued with little interruption to be heard through the woods for about half an hour, when it was asserted they had found a hare, although, as nobody had seen it, I doubted its existence. At last a hare really made its appearance, and afforded a short course to the greyhounds, but it escaped by doubling back into the wood. Two men were always stationed outside the covers in favourable spots, each with two or three greyhounds. These dogs knew their business very well, and kept quietly in their proper places. Each wore a collar with a ring, so that he could be led if necessary, the men having long leashes for the purpose ; these, however, appeared to be seldom used except for young dogs not properly broken in. When the hare turned back into cover, the hounds were cheered on, and they took a ring through some rough ground. The hare was again driven from the wood, but the greyhounds did not catch sight of it, and in the end it was lost. My object at first was if possible to pre vent the greyhounds viewing the hare, in order that we might have a run and a gallop ; but I soon discovered that, when from the nature of the ground there was no chance of a course, the harriers very soon either were called off the scent, or threw tip their heads of themselves. As the corn was for the most part standing, we had some difficulty in finding ground favourable for our sport, and where the ground was suitable hares were scarce. However, we found one now and then, and some we killed and some we lost ; occasionally hearing a pretty burst in a wood, or having a gallop from one cover to another. We got home by about one o'clock, and I had been on the whole very well amused, though my host was very much dissatisfied with his morning's sport, because the ground had been in general very unfa vourable to the greyhounds, and we had only killed in all three or four hares. This which I have described is the universal style of what is called hunting by the Russians ; they use the hounds merely to find game for the greyhounds, upon which they depend entirely for their amusement. Excepting those few who have"], [65, "Let. V.] RUSSIAN HARES. 41 seen fox-hunting in England, they cannot conceive the plea sure of that style of sport, or imagine it to be otherwise than extremely dull, since they do not at all enter into the pleasure of riding to the hounds. Riding indeed is at all times little in vogue, and Russian gentlemen never think of mounting a horse as a means of conveyance. Their pleasure consists in looking at a course, and all that they require is a small active nag worth from five to ten or twelve pounds. Tame as this sport appears to our ideas, many Russians are extremely devoted to it. A gentleman whom I met the other day told me that ho had a neighbour who lived for nothing but hare-hunting. He kept twelve hundred dogs (hounds and greyhounds), and killed annually on an average eighteen hundred hares. My informant calculates that this gentleman has got thrown into heaps the skeletons of about eighteen thousand horses. What a treasure these bones would be to an English fanner ! There are two kinds of hares in Russia, one of which lives entirely in the woods, and is much darker coloured in the summer than the English hare. Towards the middle of Oc tober it begins to change its coat, and it is perfectly w-hite by the middle of November. The other sort resembles the Eng lish hare in summer ; in winter its legs, ears, and belly be come white, but the back retains its colour. This kind, which is called the roussak, lives in the fields, and is rarely found in cover, never in large woods. Its flesh and its fur are both very superior to those of the wood hare, which, however, is much more common. Both sorts, but especially the roussaks, are, I think, larger than English hares. After spending two days at Velmogie we repeated our visit to Grouzine, and returned to Krasnoe, as I have already told you, two days ago. Yesterday I was driving one of my sisters in-law in a gig, when, on a bad piece of road about nine miles from home, we were, to my great surprise, very quietly upset. Fortunately, I was driving at a foot's-pace, and we both rolled out unhurt upon the grass. After picking up my companion I went to release the horse, who stood perfectly still, and I found that one of the shafts of the vehicle, which was old and crazy, had snapped in two under the body, and thereby caused"], [66, "HAY-HARVEST. [Let. V. 42 the accident. We soon obtained the assistance of a peasant, and he, with a piece of wood and a cord, in five minutes spliced our broken shaft, and enabled us to reach home in safety. I mention this little incident in illustration of the general hand-ness of the Russian moujik. The hay harvest, which began about the middle of July, is only just finished, and the corn harvest is now proceeding actively. The hay harvest is tedious, owing to the large sur face, in proportion to the produce, over which the scythe has to pass ; though I am told that the crops this year were in many places three times as heavy as they were last summer. They have a few large meadows, but the greater part of the hay is procured from little patches of rough ground on the outskirts of the woods, or from little hollows which are not cultivated, owing to the water hanging in them in rainy weather. I have seen fifty mowers at work in one place, and one day they had a hundred and fifty mowing in one meadow. The hay is not dried in the field, but is loaded as soon as cut on waggons drawn by oxen, and is brought into a large yard, or close, adjoining the barn, and there it is opened out to dry. They have no hay-forks, but instead they use the butt end of the scythe-handle, or a forked stick. The latter is the only implement they have for pitching up the hay into the bam. The hay is generally housed the day after it is cut, none of it being put into ricks. They make it as soon as it is dry into large cocks. Under each cock they thrust crosswise two long stakes, leaving one end of each standing out : they then pass a rope round the cock and attach it to a horse, which draws the hay thus held together along the ground to the barn. When the distance is short, the trouble of loading and unload ing waggons is thus saved, and two horses will in this manner bring in a vast quantity in the course of the day. The tenth cock, as it is brought in, is weighed and taken as the average. The whole quantity of hay made this year at Krasnoe, not reckoning the stock laid in by the peasants, which must be considerable, is about a hundred and ninety-seven tons, all harvested in excellent order. The average value of hay in the country is about eight shillings and threepence per ton ; sometimes, however, it is as high as thirty-three shillings ;"], [67, "Let. V.] CORN-HARVEST. 43 and at Petersburg it rises occasionally to fifty-five shillings a ton, which, however, is considered a ruinous price. All the crops this year seem very good, except the rye, the staple food of the country. It is generally thin and bad, and in many places a total failure. It is chiefly housed by this time, the harvest here having commenced on the 15th of August, which is later than usual. Besides rye, oats are grown here in large quantities, barley and flax to a considerable extent, and a good deal of hemp. There are also a few pease, and some small patches of spring wheat, which, however, looks very untkriving. A few hops are to be seen around the villages, and potatoes and cabbages are largely cultivated for human consumption. Potatoes have not been introduced among the peasantry to any great extent till of late years ; and even now the people rely much more upon the cabbage, which they have a peculiar mode of pickling for winter food, since they cannot always preserve potatoes from the frost. They here begin sowing rye on the 18th of August, as it is the anniversary of the consecration of the church. They have a mass, after which they proceed to a field near at hand, when the priest pronounces a blessing, and offers a public prayer for the success of their labours. Though the sowing on this day is a mere form, the seed-time commences shortly afterwards in good earnest ; and the young corn is already in some places beginning to make its appearance. As soon as the corn is cut, it is dried on a sort of kiln, threshed out, and stored up in large bins in the granaries. Here there is a threshing-machine worked by horses, but the flail is used by women as well as by men. I have seen the peasants often threshing their own corn without an implement of any kind, merely taking up the sheaf by the lower end, and beating the heads upon a spot of hard dry ground, swept clean as a threshing-floor. They dry their corn by fires in large open sheds built on purpose ; but casualties are, as might be expected, the frequent result of this dangerous practice. All the agricultural implements in general use are rude in the extreme. The peasant's spade is a mere paddle of w-ood, some times shod with iron, but more often not. His plough is an ineffective instrument drawn by a weak pony, and his harrow"], [68, "ANECDOTES OF SOUVAROFF. [Let.

His waggon does not contain above two or three barrows' load, though it is perhaps as much as his miserable horse can draw. Every peasant is a petty farmer without capital, and the wretched state of agriculture which exists is the natural consequence of the system. My father-in-law, who, like old gentlemen in the days of Horace, is not unfrequently \" laudator temporis acti Se puero- has many anecdotes of Marshal Souvaroff, which he is fond of relating. They are all more or less illustrative of the sin gular character of the man who united so much eccentricity, and even buffoonery, to his great military talents. Perhaps one or two of these stories may amuse you. When Souvaroff commanded the Russian forces in 1788, Prince Koutousoff led the assault at the storming of Ismail. He was twice repulsed ; and after his second failure an aide-de-camp of SouvarofFs rode up to him with a message, neither of reproach nor of condolence, but* with the information that he was appointed by the Commander-in-chief to the post of Commandant of Ismail. Koutousoff did not know what to make of this mes sage in the moment of his discomfiture. However, the press ing business was to take the tow-n, and, leading the assault for a third time, he succeeded. At his next interview with Souvaroff, Koutousoff asked what his meaning was in sending him the appointment of commandant at the moment of his repulse. \" Oh ! \" said the Marshal, \" I knew Koutousoff; and I knew that either Ismail would want a Russian commandant, or Koutousoff would not want a command.\" This story my father-in-law had from Prince Koutousoff himself. Souvaroff used frequently to ask the young officers and soldiers the most absurd questions, considering it a proof of smartness on their part if they gave a prompt reply, and hating above all things \" I don't know\" as the answer. He one day went up to a sentry, and, as the man presented arms, Souvaroff said, \" Tell me how many buttons there are on the uniforms of 50,000"], [69, "Let. V.] ANECDOTES OF SOUVAROFF. 45 men.\" \" I can't say,\" replied the soldier very naturally ; upon which the Marshal, according to his custom, began to abuse him and rate him for his stupidity. . The soldier, how ever, knowing Souvaroff's character, took courage, and said, \" Well, sir, perhaps it's not every question your Excellency could answer yourself; for instance, there are my two aunts, \u2014 could you please to tell me their names ?\" The man's quick ness atoned for his impudence in the general's eyes, and the soldier was made a corporal next morning. In one of Souvaroff 's campaigns, a young prince, his rela tive, joined the army, and on his introduction was very kindly received. Shortly afterwards, being ordered on some service of hardship, the young prince asked to be relieved, appealing to the general's favour and promised friendship. \"Ah,\" said Souvaroff, \" it's very true, I've a great regard for your family ; go to your quarters, and I'll send a written order which will set the matter at rest.\" In due time the promised paper reached the young officer ; but on being opened it contained only two parallel straight lines ; one inscribed with the word Duty, the other with the word Favour. The young man was mathematician enough to understand the general's hint \u2014 that in his eyes Duty and Favour could never be made to coincide.

Yaroslav, October 3rd, 1837. My last letter made you acquainted with our projected visit to Yaroslav, where we have now spent upwards of a fortnight most agreeably. My time has been so constantly occupied, that I have never had leisure for writing to you, and I sit down now to wipe off the arrear. We left Krasnoe on the 13th of September, being provided with a travelling carriage by the kindness of M \u2014 's father. Our regrets at quitting the place, which had been our home for nearly three months, and our leave-takings with those from whom we parted, I shall pass over in silence. The General sent us with his own horses the first eight-and-thirty miles, having despatched a set half way over night, so that we found six fresh horses awaiting us. We hired horses to take us the remaining stage to Tver, of about two-and -twenty miles, along the high road between Petersburg and Moscow. Tver, the capital of the province, or government as it is called, of the same name, in which our time had hitherto been spent, is a city of considerable size, situated on the right bank of the Volga, which we crossed by a bridge of boats on entering the town. Here we were obliged to sleep, as some arrangements w _re necessary before we could proceed on our journey, since the remainder of our route lay for the most part along a line of cross-roads little frequented, and on which no regular posting stations existed. However, owing to the kindness of the Go-"], [71, "Let. VI.] TVER \u2014 AVANT-COURIER. 47 vernor, Count Tolstoy, all the difficulties which we should otherwise have met with in procuring horses were done away. Our present hosts, when they invited us to Yaroslav, had promised to bespeak Count Tolstoy's good offices for us, and to beg him to furnish us with the means of proceeding through his government. On arriving, therefore, at Tver, I sent a note to the Governor, applying for an order for horses, and his secretary immediately came and said that everything should be done for our accommodation, and that he would return in tho morning, when all would be ready for our departure. Accordingly, as soon as we were dressed in the morning, the secretary appeared, bringing with him the requisite papers from the Governor, who, he said, had also desired him, as we were foreigners, to place at our disposal a courier to enforce his orders on the road. This kind offer we gladly accepted, and the courier's activity and attention were of the utmost use, to say nothing of the uniform which he wore, and which carried no small authority in itself. As we had no place for him about the carriage, he preceded us in the tilega, or light waggon, with a pair of horses, which is always used on such occasions in Russia. We gave him two hours' start, in order that he might have time to get horses ready for us at every stage, and about eleven o'clock we set out ourselves. We travelled for about sixteen miles \u2014 in the course of which we changed horses without a minute's unnecessary delay \u2014 along the great Moscow road, being driven throughout at a steady gallop of more than twelve miles an hour. This pace was kept up for some time after quitting the main road, the bye road into which we struck being at first pretty good. We soon came to the bank of the Volga, which we followed for some miles ; and we then crossed to the left side of the river by a floating bridge, and imme diatelj- afterwards found ourselves at the end of our second stage. Here and everywhere else we found horses in readi ness \u2014 thanks to our valuable courier in advance. The stages varied in length from fourteen to thirty-four versts (the verst you will remember to be about three quarters of a mile). We were posting with eight horses, viz. two for the courier and six for ourselves ; but the expense was not ruinous. A half-"], [72, "48 CROSS-ROADS. [Let. VI. penny per horse per verst, which was the price, with about eightpence a stage for the drivers, brought the whole cost to something less than sixpience a mile. After quitting the second station, we were obliged to proceed for some miles at a foot's pace. The road lay through a marshy forest of stunted unhealthy-looking birch and fir ; while a small misty- rain, which began to fall, was completely in accordance with the desolate scene through which we were passing ; and a more dreary picture could not easily be conceived than that which presented itself in this part of our journey. The road was what in America would have been called a corduroy road, con sisting of logs of wood laid across side by side, and by no means evenly placed. The pleasure of jolting over this species of causeway for some miles you may easily imagine. At length, however, we got into an open country and into a better road. The weather at the same time improved, and by eight o'clock at night we had a bright full moon over our heads with a cloudless sky, which accompanied us to the end of our journey. We had no inns upon the road ; but about seven o'clock, at a village where we changed horses, we supped in an isba, or peasant's house, where we were supplied with cream and hot water for our tea, and with cups to drink it out of. This accom modation is to be had in almost every village, and from sixpence to tenpence is the usual charge. For tea and sugar, and indeed for everything else, not excepting bread, the traveller must depend upon himself. Unless he be a Russian born, he will not be able to eat the black rye-bread of the peasants. The samavar, or Russian urn, heated with charcoal, which is found in every house from the highest to the lowest in this country, is an excellent invention, insuring good tea, since the water is always boiling, and the teapot, being placed on the top, is kept quite hot. We proceeded all night upon our journey, and about two o'clock in the morning we came to a river, which it was neces sary to cross by a floating bridge. The leaders were taken off, there not being room for them with the carriage upon the bridge, which was small and narrow. The river being shallow at the edge, the bridge could not be"], [73, "Let. VI.] PASSING A FERRY. 49 brought quite close to the bank, and we therefore had to drive through water for about the length of the carriage to reach it ; and then, there being no proper gangway for the wheels to run up, the bridge fonned a high step or block against which they rested. The four wheelers either could not or would not draw us over this obstacle, and, after two or three vain jerks, they refused the collar altogether. We could not get out of the carriage w-ithout stepping into water up to our knees, which, in a frosty September night, we did not feel inclined to do. The bridge was so narrow that, if the leaders had been put to again, and had succeeded by a sudden spring in forcing the carriage upon the bridge, the horses probably would not have been able to stop it in time to prevent our running across into the river on the other side, where the water was deep. We, therefore, remained stationary for about half an hour, when the ferryman, who had gone for assistance to a village, returned, bringing with him about twenty peasants, who took off the horses, and, with the aid of levers, soon placed us on the floating bridge. Nothing can exceed the readj' good will with which a Rus sian peasant gives his assistance in case of need, especially where, as in this case, he is remote from great towns and great roads. These people were called up in the middle of the night, and they7 were employed up to their knees in water for some time in raising the wheels over the obstacle ; but they con tinued the whole time in the most perfect good humour, and there was none of the swearing and abuse of one another, which would, in many countries, have been heard on a similar occa sion. They apparently considered that they were merely ren dering an ordinary service to their neighbour the fenynian ; and, after we had crossed the river, they only solicited through him a trifle, in addition to his ordinary charge, for their assistance. The people commonly address each other as Irat, or brother, and their superiors use the same term in speaking to them ; indeed, a master, in giving an order to his servant, often calls him brother. In about four hours after crossing the river, about sunrise, we reached the town of Kashine, where, however, we made co stop, but passed through and changed horses a verst or two"], [74, "[Let. VI. 50 KASHINE \u2014 OUGLITCH. further on. Kashine is a very old town, built in a straggling manner on steep broken ground, intersected by ravines. It once possessed a kremlin, and was strongly fortified. Like all ancient Russian towns, it is filled with churches, and the various views of it which presented themselves to us in the early morning were extremely singular and picturesque. When we stopped to change horses, we breakfasted, in the same manner as we had supped the night before, at the house of a peasant, who furnished us with hot water and cream \u2014 the latter being a luxury to be met with almost everywhere in Russia. At the next station we overtook our courier, who had horses ready to take us to the town of Ouglitch. He had already given us his services for about a hundred miles, and he offered to proceed, if we liked, to Yaroslav. However, we considered that it would be unnecessary to take him farther, as M \u2014 's uncle, to whose house we were going, had promised to order horses to be in readiness for us at every stage in his Govern ment, which we had now entered. We therefore dismissed our courier with a small recompence for his services, and, pro ceeding on our road, reached Ouglitch about one o'clock. Before we entered the town we crossed the Volga, for the third time since the commencement of our journey, on a floating bridge. We drove, as we had been directed, to the house of the Gorodnitch, an officer who is, I believe, at the head of the town police, as the name seems to imply. This gentleman, who spoke French, gave us the agreeable infonnation that he had received the promised instructions from the Governor, and that he had horses prepared for us ; inviting us at the same time into his house until they were ready. The horses, how ever, did not appear for more than an hour, and it was nearly three o'clock before we were able once more to set out, having still nearly eighty miles between us and Yaroslav. Ouglitch, like Kashine, is a very old town; it contains about four thousand inhabitants, and there are no less than twenty-four churches, besides two convents. None of the churches, however, appeared to be as handsome as some of those which we had passed at Kashine. The first stage from Ouglitch was thirty-four versts, and the"], [75, "Let. VI.] RUSSIAN TRAVELLING. 51 road, for a great part of the distance, lay through a heavy sand. The horses were knocked up before they had finished their work, and during the latter part of the stage the istvostchik got down from the box and stood upon the pole, leaning with his back against the edge of the footboard ; his object being to get closer to the horses, that his whip might have more power. We found horses awaiting us at the end of the first and second stages from Ouglitch ; but at the last station, before reaching Yaroslav, those which had been ordered for us had, owing to some mistake, been sent away, and we were detained there in the dark more than an hour. The titarosta, or head man of the village, whose duty it was to furnish horses for us, went from house to house to procure them, and they came, one by one, miserable-looking animals, no bigger than ponies, until at last six were collected ; after which the ceremony of arranging where each was to go, and of putting them to, occupied no small time. In travelling in Russia, the traces, which are ropes, belong to the carriage, and not to the harness of the horses. The collars have a leather loop on each side, to which the traces are tied, and the istvostchiks are very particular in seeing that they are of the proper length, and in placing the horses as close as possible to their work, and in the early part of a stage one usually has a stoppage or two to adjust a trace or a pole piece, which does not exaetlj- please the fastidious eye of the istvostchik. On this occasion we were rather more than the usual time in putting to the horses, and we had rather more than the average number of stoppages in the course of the first three versts after we had started ; but this was not won derful with a team of six peasants' horses, no two of which, in all probability, had ever been in harness together before, and some of which appeared at first inclined strongly to object to their new occupation. There seemed, however, to be a mutual understanding between the peasants who drove us and their beasts. Whether the latter were stimulated by the hopes of a feed of corn if they behaved well, as were their drivers by the prospect of a net vodka or drink-money, I do not know ; but after a short time we all got on exceedingly well together, and were driven, as had been the case everywhere, quite as fast as e 2"], [76, "NA VODKA AND NACHAI. [Let. VI. 52 seemed possible, and much faster than I could have expected considering the nature of the road. We were well shaken and jolted about, but no accident happened. During the whole course of the journey we seldom had a postilion who was luxurious enough to use a saddle ; they generally had a bag or a mat thrown across the horse instead. Sometimes they had a rope hanging down on each side with a loop, into which they put their feet by way of stimips ; very often, however, even this rude accommodation was wanting. The great pace at which the Russians generally drive when the road is good is very dangerous for the postilion, since, if his horse falls, the carriage cannot be stopped in time, and he is run over and probably killed. Such accidents are not un common on the main roads. It is astonishing how well the istvostchiks drive four horses abreast through the bad roads, wearing gloves like those of an English hedger, made without fingers, and holding three reins in each hand. There is no country where a little extra drink-money will do so much as here ; for though the istvostchik is frequently the owner of the horses which he drives, he appears to care more for the vosseim grievnik, or eightpenny-piece, which he gets as navodka, than for the roubles which he receives for the hire of his horses. Na vodka means literally for-a-dram, but it is now coming into fashion among the more refined istvostchiks to beg instead a nachai, or tea-money. They are very goodhumoured fellows, and generally, when they come to be paid,put on what they evidently consider a most insinuating tone and manner. They come to the carriage-door, pull off their hats, and make a low bow. Then they shake back their long hair, which this performance has brought into their eyes, and say, Navodka hatushka, or nachai, as the case may be, in their most persuasive tone. Batushka is a sort of endearing, and at the same time respectful address, which is commonly used to superiors, as brat (or brother) is to equals and inferiors ; it signifies literally little father. When they receive their money they generally look satisfied, while at the same time they often think a little more may be had for the asking, and they remark, with an insinuating smile, that they have driven very well ; and if a small coin is, on this plea, added to their navodka, they retire highly delighted,"], [77, "Let. VI.] YAROSLAV \u2014 THE VOLGA. 53 with a profusion of thanks and bows. One man in the middle of our journey amused us by turning round to M \u2014 , after he had received the usual drink-money, and saying, \" Ah, Marie Alexandrovna, I 'm sure you '11 give me a good navodka, for I know your father, and your uncles, and all the family.\" He had probably found out who we were si om the courier, or from our servant ; at all events, I believe he gained his point. All the way, after we entered the government of Yaroslav, we remarked that the road was lined on each side by a double row of birch-trees, and I now find that all the public roads in the government are ornamented in the same manner. We arrived here on the 16th of September, at about two o'clock in the morning. A servant soon made his appearance and conducted us to a very comfortable set of rooms which were prepared for our reception, and which, besides being in other respects very handsomely furnished, boast the unusual luxury of having their floors entirely covered with carpet. We got some tea, and then went to bed as soon as possible, though not without having admired the superb moonlight view from our windows over the Volga, which here is a noble stream about seven hundred yards wide. This house, which was originally built as a palace for a member of the imperial family, forms a very splendid residence for the Governor, and the situation is exceedingly fine, as the town lies at the back, while the windows in front look upon a terrace at the foot of which flows the Volga. The terrace, which stands at a great height above the water, extends for more than a mile, commanding a fine view of the river and the country beyond. A very considerable trade is carried on in the town, which is large, handsome, and flourishing; the shops are exceedingly well supplied with goods, and many of the tradesmen, I am told, are very rich. Yaroslav contains twenty-eight thousand inhabitants, and forty-three or forty- four churches. Besides the terrace above the Volga, there is a, handsome boulevard, and also a public garden. There are a number of large houses in the town, which in the winter are inhabited by gentlemen's families, so that the society at that season is very good."], [78, "SOLDIERS AND THEIR BARRACKS. [Let. VI. 54 On the Sunday, two days after our arrival, we attended the performance of mass at the military church, by the invitation of the commanding officer, Colonel Goulaivitch, a fine soldier like man, who, as well as his lady, has shown us great atten tion and civility since we have been here, and both of whom we have been fortunate enough to meet almost daily. The church was entirely filled with soldiers, and the effect pro duced by so many voices chanting in unison the hymns and responses was exceedingly fine. This regiment is a military institution which has been esta blished here about two years, for the purpose of educating and training up soldiers' sons ; the object being to provide a supply of intelligent well-taught non-commissioned officers for the army. The regiment is composed of three battalions, each more than a thousand strong. The first battalion consists of little boys up to the age of about fifteen ; the second, of lads from fifteen to seventeen or eighteen ; and the third is effec tive ; but in the whole corps there is hardly a soldier more than twenty years old. After the conclusion of the service the men were paraded before the Governor, and on this occasion I heard for the first time the singular salutation of the Russian soldiers to their inspecting officer. Each company as it marches past gives a peculiar shout, at a given signal, as if with one voice, and with a sort of sudden crash, the effect of which is very strik ing. After the parade the Colonel took us all over the bar racks, which are airy and well organised ; everything seemed in excellent order, and the dormitories and other apartments clean and well ventilated. The boys are instructed in read ing, writing, and arithmetic ; they also learn drawing and various branches of professional knowledge, and they are all taught some trade. Nearly every part of the soldiers' equip ments is made at home, even including the patent leather for their belts, which seemed to be of very good quality. Por trait-painting is among the arts practised by the soldiers : and we were shown pictures of the Emperor, the Colonel, and most of the officers, very creditably executed by one of them. After making the tour of the establishment, we went to see the"], [79, "Let. VI.] SWEARING ALLEGIANCE. 55 boys sit dow-n to dinner. They first sang a hymn standing in their places, and, when they had finished, the sound of a bugle gave the signal for them to be seated. They seemed exceed ingly comfortable, and everything looked very clean. A cer tain number acted as waiters to the rest, a service which they all take in turn. In the middle of the room on an elevated platform was a small unoccupied table, at which* the Colonel told us that offenders were made to dine as a punishment. I have since seen the military hospital, which was very clean and seemed well conducted. On the ground-floor is the dis pensary and surgeon's room, the patients being all upstairs ; at the head of each patient's bed is a board, on which is in scribed his name and the nature of his complaint, and behind the board is placed a paper in which the medical man in at tendance is required to insert a daily register of the symp toms, treatment, &c, of the patient; so that the Inspector of the hospital, on making his rounds, may at all times be able to judge whether proper skill has been exercised, and clue at tention paid, by the subordinates. Colonel Goulaivitch invited us the other day to his house, to witness the taking the oaths of allegiance and fidelity to the Emperor on entering the service, by M \u2014 's young cousin, the Governor's son, who has just received his first commission. The colours of the regiment were displayed in the dining-room, and under them were placed on a table a large Bible and a cross. A priest was in attendance in his robes, and there were also about a dozen cantonists, as the young soldiers are called, who were to officiate as choristers upon this occasion. The new ensign repeated after the priest a long oath, holding in his right hand a corner of the colours. He then knelt down and kissed the Bible and the cross, and the ceremony was con cluded by a hymn sung by the cantonists. I went about a fortnight ago with General Poltoratzky to a horse-fair at a large straggling village two or three-and-twenty miles hence. There were a good many horses shown, but few fine animals ; they were, however, very cheap. The General bought one as a carriage-horse for three hundred roubles (about twelve pounds) which would have been worth forty or fifty pounds in England, as he was a handsome well-sized"], [80, "[Let. VI. 56 HORSE-FAIR. horse, sound, and only five years old. The scene was amus ing enough, and as unlike an English fair as can be imagined. There were a good many gentlemen present, most of them in undress uniforms, and many with crosses at their button-holes. We walked through a refreshment-booth filled with peasants and horse-dealers, and found them all as quiet as possible, and, with hardly an exception, drinking tea. These people do not put sugar into their cups in the ordinary way, but they either hold a lump between their teeth and sip the tea through it, or else they hold the sugar in the left hand, and nibble off a little bit now and then, as they drink their tea. We were not destined this day to suffer from hunger. First of all, when we were in the midst of the fair, two or three largo water-melons were brought, and we all sat down to eat them on the spot, some on the grass and others on the shafts of a waggon, while his excellency the Governor compromised his dignity by sitting in the middle on a reversed tub. Shortly afterwards we were summoned to a luncheon, which abounded in champagne and good things of all kinds, and which might well have passed for a dinner. This entertainment was given by the great man of the village, namely, the steward of the proprietor, who was himself an absentee. The luncheon was no sooner over than we set off for a country-house which lay on our road home, and where I found that we, and most of the gentlemen whom we had met with, were engaged to dine. I confess this was a pleasure I could have dispensed with, having dined already, as I had supposed. However, the offered hospitality was not to be declined, and we arrived at the house a party of more than twenty ; a force evidently stronger than our entertainer had anticipated in the mornino- ; for, although it was dinner-time when we reached the house, we waited full two hours before we sat down to table. After all, we dined and reached home before nine o'clock\u2014 a fact which will remind you that we are not keeping English hours. We have now a sharp frost, and two days ago (the 1st of October) we were reminded of the approach of winter by finding in the morning the roofs of the houses white with"], [81, "Let. VI.] SOCIETY. 57 snow. We, however, are armed against the cold, as we have provided ourselves, since we came here, with furs and other warm clothing for the winter. The shops, as I have already said, are well supplied, especially with furs ; but it is by no means agreeable on a cold day to make purchases which re quire a little time in selecting : for, according to the old Rus sian custom, the shops have no stoves or fireplaces. The shops do not here, as in most countries, adjoin the residences of the tradesmen to whom they belong, but are all col lected together in a sort of bazaar, a large building consisting of warehouses with shops in front, and in which no fire is allowed for fear of accidents. The tradesman spends the day in his shop, and only goes home at night. When the weather is cold he wraps himself up in furs, and keeps himself warm by drinking enormous quantities of hot tea, which is retailed in the streets to them and to the droschka-drivers who stand for hire, by people who are constantly going about with a portable samavar or urn, kept hot by charcoal, and with cups fixed in a belt, and strapped round their waists. The bazaar or collection of shops in all Russian towns is called the Gas tinas Dvor, or Public Court. Every Sunday morning, and every fete-day, the governor of Yaroslav holds a sort of levee \u2014 that is to say-, a crowd of official persons in full uniform assemble before breakfast to pay their respects : and twice a week his lady is at home to all the people who are inclined to spend the evening, and a large society is generally assembled to play cards and sup.* Be sides this, w-e have had dinner parties two or three times a week, and the party living in the house is considerable in itself. The present time, however, is not the gay season at Yaroslav, as most of the families who compose the society in the winter are still absent at their country houses. The esta blishment in this house is large even in Russia, especially for a town, but it would be considered enormous in England. Here, however, assessed taxes are unheard of. In the house about a hundred people are maintained ; and upwards of * (Note, second edition.\") \u2014 Among the visitors at the Governor's resi dence during our stay at Yaroslav was Prince Gortchakoff \u2014 the geueral. not the diplomatist."], [82, "[Let. VI. 58 RANK AND TITLE. thirty handsome horses, chiefly for harness, are kept in good condition in the stables. The Russians appear to be extremely devoted to cards, playing on Sunday as much as any other day. Whist is the usual game. They sit down before dinner, which is commonly at three or four o'clock, and, when it is announced, they leave their cards on the table, and resume their game the moment they return from the dining-room, continuing to play from that time till the party disperses ; so that, excepting for those who are no card-players, there really is no conversation. I observe everywhere a custom which is in our eyes exceed ingly slovenly, namely, that of marking tbe state of the game by scoring it in chalk upon the table-cloth, instead of using counters. Pieces of chalk, and brushes for erasing the figures, are always put on the table with the cards. I will conclude my letter by a few remarks on the subject of Russian rank and title, which do not go together as in Eng land. The Russians have but two titles of honour \u2014 that of knaize, prince or duke, and graf, count. There are also barons, but they are not originally of Russian extraction, but German, usually from Courland and Livonia. All these titles multiply themselves ad infaiitum,* being enjoyed equally by every de scendant of the possessor, in the male line, without any dis tinction in favour of the eldest branch : they are, therefore, of comparatively little value, except as procuring considera tion in society. All legal rank, privilege, or precedence in Russia is either military, or is measured by a military grade. A prince who is an ensign must give w-ay to the son of a shopkeeper who is a lieutenant, and the daughter of an untitled general will walk before a princess whose father is only a colonel. j Though, however, titles are of * As an instance of this, I may observe that of the name of Galitzin only there are, at present, no less than three hundred princes. How many princesses there may be I do not know, but they must be very numerous. f There is, however, a title of Prince which is conferred rarely, and only for long or distinguished services, and which is therefore highly valuable. The Prince Volchonsky ; Field-marshal Count Paskievitch, Prince of Warsaw and the Prince of Italy, Count Souvaroff, are noblemen holding this rank. Princes of this class have the style of Highness, and the title descends only to the eldest son and to his heirs male; not passing to all the descendants, like other Russian titles."], [83, "Let. VI.] NOBILITY. 59 no account, nobility confers great privileges. None but a noble can possess serfs, without which landed property in this country- is of little value. The nobles are free from the con scription, which presses heavily on all other classes. They are in no case liable to the knout and other corporal punish ments ; and they can always claim to enter the service, as under-officers at least, receiving a commission, or attaining an equivalent rank as civilians, in three years at furthest, except ing in cases of misconduct. I should add, that being noble in Russia, as in some other continental countries, corresponds to the being a gentleman in England, although the Russian as sumes the coronet and full-faced helmet with closed visor, instead of the simple crest and side-faced helmet of the untitled English gentleman. The Russian noble does not, however, use supporters to his arms, unless they have been specially granted to his family. Nobility is earned by service or acquired by inheritance. Every one who serves the Emperor, either in a civil or military capacity with the rank of officer, is noble, and may, therefore, wear a coronet on his seal or carriage, whatever he may have been by birth. Unless, however, he was noble by birth, his nobility does not descend to his chil dren if he has not reached, at least, the grade of major ; after which his family is placed in the position of hereditary no blesse.* A census is taken at certain intervals, and if, during three generations, any family from father to son have failed to enter the sendee of the crown, it loses its nobility, it is erased from the list, and its members are reduced to the class of ordinary peasants. Excepting the clergy, who in Russia are a class apart, the mem bers of all branches of the liberal professions are, as I have already told you, considered as \" in the service ;\" and each individual is classed with entire reference to military rank. One civilian has the grade of ensign, another of lieutenant, and so on, up to full general. From the rank of major-general upwards, all persons, with their wives and daughters, so long as the latter remain unmarried, have the style of Excellency. Their sons * The result naturally is, that nobility and penury are often combined.

Yaroslav, October 4th, 1837. We were much interested a few days ago by a little impromptu exhibition, which displayed the efficiency of the fire-establish ment, and the alertness of the men : before, however, com mencing any description of what we saw, I must give you a short account of the system. The fire-establishments here are not, as in England, in the hands of insurance companies, but under the immediate control of government. The firemen are soldiers, and the horses, engines, &c, are the property of the crown. The whole, how ever, appears to be well organised, and the general regulations laid down by law to be extremely good. In the towns watch men are stationed day and night on the tops of high towers, which are built in various quarters, so as to command the town ; and at the foot of each tower is an establishment of firemen, horses, and engines, which are or ought to be always ready at a moment's notice. As soon as the watchman on the tower discovers a fire he rings a bell, which gives the alami to the firemen below, while at the same time, by- a telegraph, which can be used either by day or night, there being in the latter case a certain arrangement of lanterns, he points out the direc tion of the fire, and warns the establishments in other quarters of the to v\\ -n to send their assistance. As soon as the train of"], [86, "VILLAGE REGULATIONS. [Let. VII. 62 engines is ready, it proceeds at full speed through the streets, neither stopping nor turning aside, being preceded by a horse man, who gallops along, shouting and warning all persons to clear the way. If it is dark, the leading engine carries a bright light high up on a pole, which is easily distinguished, by its position, from the lamps of a carriage as it moves along. When a fire breaks out at St. Petersburg, it is the duty of the aide-de-camp in waiting immediately to inform the Emperor, even if the latter is asleep in bed. When a fire is at all considerable the Emperor always gets up and goes to it him self; in other cases the aide-de-camp is ordered to go to the spot, and at the conclusion to return and report what loss has been sustained, with the general result of the misfortune. In the country the regulations are very good, and it is the duty of the starosta or bailiff of every village to see that they are enforced, though they are nevertheless in many cases totally neglected. In the villages where the rules are carried into effect, every house has a small board affixed to it, on which is painted a number, and under the number is a figure of some implement useful at a fire ; on one being drawn a bucket, on another an axe, on a third a ladder or a pole with a hook at the end for pulling dow-n burning thatch and rafters. The moment a fire is discovered in the village, the inhabitant of every house is bound to appear provided with the implement depicted outside his door. Besides which there are various regulations for establishing order in the operations, such as the appointing one man out of a certain number to be the captain of the gang, and to direct their proceedings. If the rules were always properly enforced, it would not be easy in a country village to contrive better arrangements than these : since ready assistance with a proper number of all useful implements is provided in case of fire, and confusion is as far as possible avoided. It is the duty of the starosta to visit the houses from time to time in order to see that the implement belonging to each is ready and fit for use, and even that the buckets are supplied with water. The necessity for such precautions is unfortunately exem plified by the frequent occurrence of rural fires. The peasants,"], [87, "Let. VII.] FREQUENCY OF FIRES. 63 as T have already observed, live entirely in villages. Their houses and outbuildings are almost universally constructed of wood, and covered with a loose thatch; and, therefore, isa fire once breaks out, it spreads with inconceivable rapidity from house to house, and whole villages are sometimes thus de stroyed. The period when these misfortunes are most com mon is in the autumn, immediately after harvest, when the peasants are drying their corn at fires made in wooden thatched buildings. If the proprietors are careful in placing their drying-houses at a safe distance from one another, and from the dwellings, and also in prohibiting the peasants from stacking the whole of their produce close around them, the worst that can ensue from an accident is the destruction of a drying-house with the corn which may happen to be in it at the time : but nothing can exceed the characteristic imprudence of the Russian pea sants. The orders of their masters are disobeyed. To save a little trouble, the whole of their produce is brought at once as near as possible to the drying-house ; a fire breaks out, and a year's provision is destroyed in an hour. The master may inflict punishment for the disobedience of his orders, but the loss to a great degree falls on himself; for the law decrees, that if, from a failure of crops, or from any other misfortune, the peasant should be in want, his master shall supply him with the necessary provisions. The exhibition which introduced this subject was as follows. \u2014 I was walking on the Boulevard with M \u2014 and her uncle, when the latter proposed to us to see the fire-establishment, which was close by. We readily assented, expecting merely to be shown over the place, and to hear the system explained. As we entered the yard, however, the general made a sign to the watchman on the look-out tower, the latter touched the alarm-bell, and instantly all was in a state of activity. Men sprung out from every quarter ; the engines were run out of the houses ; horses were brought full trot out of the stables ready harnessed, and were put to ; and in the space of four minutes and a half from the original signal, fourteen vehicles, with thirty-three or thirty-four horses attached to them, were drawn up in a line in the yard ready to start. The machines"], [88, "[Let. VII. 64 EXHIBITION OF FIRE-ENGINES. consisted of fire-engines, carriages conveying barrels full of water, ladders, and an apparatus for covering the walls and roofs of houses adjacent to the fire with a screen of sail-cloth. The water-barrels are necessary, since there are no pipes or fire-plugs in a Russian town. At a second signal from the Governor, the engines, &c._, filed one after another out of the yard, and went slowly down the street, the men having taken their proper places upon them. At the further end of the street they turned, and came thun dering back at full gallop. Some of the machines were drawn by two, and others by three, horses abreast, all being strong and serviceable animals. When we expressed our admiration at the rapidity and alertness shown in getting the horses and engines ready for action, the General assured us that, so far from any preparation having been made, his appearance was totally unexpected, and that, the day being a fete, all the men were absent who could be spared from duty. And the truth of this was proved by the arrival of the master of police at a gallop in his droschka, he being the chief of the fire establishment, and having just been informed that the engines were rattling through the town. Whether it was for actual service, or, as proved to be the case, merely for inspection by the Governor, this officer did not know till he arrived on the scene of action. A few days after this we were invited to see an exhibition, of the manner of proceeding and working the engines in case of a fire : but the display on this occasion was not nearly so interesting to me, since everything was prepared beforehand ; while the activity on the former day furnished a proof of the real utility and good organization of the establishment, and of the efficiency and alertness of the men in a case of emergency. The powers of the engines, and the manner in which they were worked, as displayed in this second exhibition, could not stand a comparison with the performances of London engines in the hands of London firemen ; but I think that few pro vincial towns in England could boast of superiority in these respects over Yaroslav. Besides the engines, the chief imple ments to be remarked were ladders, divided for the conveni ence of packing like the parts of a telescope, and drawn out"], [89, "Let. VII.] VISIT TO A MONASTERY. 65 by pulleys, so as to reach when required to a very considerable height ; grappling irons for pulling down walls ; and the apparatus, .which I have already mentioned, of sail-cloth stretched on poles, which could be hoisted up like the sails of a ship, and placed in front of a house, with other pieces of sail-cloth for laying over roofs. These cloths, being kept constantly wet by means of the engines, form a great protec tion to the timber walls and boarded roofs which are so com mon in a Russian town ; and the houses are easily covered, being generally low, and frequently not more than one story in elevation. In St. Petersburg the building wooden houses is now wisely forbidden by law. On the morning of the 21st the Governor's brother-in-law, Prince Andre Galitzin, proposed to me at breakfast to accompany him to the monastery of Tolga, about seven miles hence, where he was going to pay a visit to the ex-archbishop of Yaroslav,* a prelate who has resigned his episcopal functions, and who now lives in retirement in the convent. We went in a light low caleche belonging to my companion, with three horses abreast, or, as this is called in Russia, a troika. The horses had cost, as I was assured, but five pounds each ; yet we went sometimes at the rate of eighteen, and never less than fifteen, miles an hour, the middle horse trotting all the time while the others galloped. A light open caleche is, in some respects, much better for Russian travelling than a close carriage, as it is less liable to upset in bad roads ; and three or four horses being always sufficient to draw it, no leaders are required, and therefore in going fast the life of a postilion is not risked. For a long journey, however, especially with a lady, the comfort of a close carriage is very requisite. The monastery being on the further side of the Volga, we crossed the river in a boat, and landed at the gate of the con vent. The reaches of the river in both directions are here extremely- fine, and the banks handsome and well w-ooded. We were received by the archbishop, with whom we sat some time ; however, as he only spoke Russian, the conversation lay entirely between him and my companion. He was dressed * Every government in Russia is an episcopal or archiepiscopal see. No one but a monk can become a bishop. F"], [90, "[Let. VII. CONVENT TREASURES. 66 in a caftan or wrapper of dark-coloured silk, with a shawl sash round his waist, and a monk's cap of black velvet on his head ; the monk's cap being in the shape of a hat without a rim, and covered by a black hood hanging down behind. A Russian, on saluting or taking leave of a priest, always kisses his hand, while the priest in return makes the sign of the cross, and blesses him. After our visit to the ex-archbishop we pro ceeded to the church, which is old and curious, the walls and roof being entirely covered with paintings of saints. In the corner of the church stood a man with wax-candles for sale, two or three of which my companion bought, and, having lighted them before an image, he ordered a Te Deum (a short service, which was performed by three monks), for which he paid a fee of ten roubles. During the reading of a passage from the Gospel he bent himself in an attitude of the utmost humility under the book, so that it rested on his shoulders like the globe on an Atlas ; and he continued in that posi tion till the monk had done reading. He also paid great adoration to an image of the Virgin which was over the altar, and to which he afterwards called my attention. It was considered remarkable, not only as being set in a broad frame of pearls, the value of which must have been very great, but also from a miraculous legend connected with its history^. After the service some of the monks took us to see the treasures of the convent, consisting of robes for the archbishop ; some of velvet embroidered with gold, and others of cloth of gold, with mitres to match ; many of which were very handsome, and some curious from their antiquity. There were also Bibles bound with gold, and decorated with jewels ; and gold chalices and crosses, with other ornaments for the church. After this display we were shown the refectory, and we imme diately afterwards left the convent. The monks were an ill favoured race, with vulgar features, and not a fine or dignified countenance among them. Monks and nuns never eat meat ; but they are allowed the use of eggs, butter, and milk, except ing during the fasts of the church. As soon as we were seated in the boat to return, my com panion begged me not to suppose that when I saw him kneel-"], [91, "Let. VII.] GOING TO BED IN PUBLIC. 67 ing before an image* he was paying adoration to the image itself, but to that which it represented. He added, that the Greek church grounded the use of images on the well-known legend, which they receive as true, of Abgarus, King of Edessa, receiving from our Saviour a letter accompanied by his portrait. I was afterwards told the story of the image which I had seen in the church. It is said to have appeared by night in the midst of a burning bush some centuries ago to a certain archbishop, who took possession of it. He was afterwards directed b}- dreams to build the monastery and church of Tolga, and to place it there. The following day the Governor proposed to me to go -with him to an estate of his which he wished to visit, about sixtyr miles hence, on the Volga, near the town of Riepinsk ; and after spending the night there to return the next day. Accord ingly, after an early dinner, we set off, accompanied by Madame Poltoratzky's brother, Prince A. Galitzin, and Colonel Shipoff, the General's aide-de-camp. The road was but indifferent ; how ever, we reached our journey's end in a little more than five hours and a half, including the delay of changing horses twice. This operation is not perfonned here quite as fast as at Houns low, but a governor travelling within the limits of his own province does not tolerate much delay on the road. The house where we were to sleep was merely the residence of the super intendent, with a couple of rooms reserved for an occasion like the present. One of these was appropriated to Colonel Shipoff and the Prince ; while mj- host and I were to bivouac upon a couple of sofas in the other. In due time our companions took their leave, our room being constantly besieged by a variety of the people about the place, coming to speak to their master on business, and to bring in their reports : while the passage was filled with others waiting for their turn of admission. However, the Governor wound up his watch, pulled off his coat, and at last fairly got into bed, still continuing his audience to the crowd in waiting. The court being held with open doors, I plainly saw, from the number of people who still thronged the passage, that, if I intended to go to bed at all, I * It is almost unnecessary to remark that the consecrated images of the Greek church are invariably paintings and not sculptures. _ 2"], [92, "[Let.

As soon as I was in bed, the whole scene amused me much, and, had I possessed a talent for drawing, there were abundant subjects before me sol an excellent sketch. The expectant crowd in the passage pressing forward as far as they thought they could venture, with their bearded faces half in light and half in shade, formed the background ; while in the room there were always two or three prominent figures, conversing with their master, who reclined at his ease on the couch opposite to me, smoking his pipe, as he transacted his business. At length, \u2014 \" The chamber was cleared, The train disappeared,\" and a servant brought in a splendid melon, which, with a glass of wine, furnished us an excellent supper in bed ; while our companions came back in their dressing-gowns and sat talking for some time, so that it must have been late before the candles were put out and we composed ourselves to sleep. This, un fortunately, proved a vain attempt, for the room, having been long uninhabited, swarmed with fleas, which gave neither of us a moment's respite till near morning. The next day, after walking about, and looking at a new house which is in progress, and which will command from the windows a magnificent view of the Volga, we drove to the neighbouring town of Riepinsk, where a very large trade is carried on in com and tallow. We proceeded first to the house of the Mayor, who gave us an excellent luncheon and a bottle of champagne, and who afterwards accompanied us round the town. He was an admirable specimen of the true old-fashioned Russian tradesman ; a tall, portly old man, with a fine grey beard, and a long blue surtout, buttoned according to custom on the left side, and with black boots drawn over his trowsers. There was not much to see ; the principal objects being the Exchange, and a church which was in building, to the top of which we w-alked up inclined planes. The river was exceed ingly full of barges, and we went on board one of the largest, which was used merely as a tow-boat to drag a loaded train."], [93, "Let. VII.] A NAME'S-DAY. 69 Its progress against stream must be exceedingly slow. An anchor is carried out ahead, to which the barge is warped up by means of a strong cable and a capstan turned by about two and-twenty horses, which work below deck, as in a threshing machine. There were fifty horses on board for the purpose of relays. There is water communication all the way from Rie pinsk to Petersburg, the distance being about nine hundred miles, while by land it is but three hundred and fifty. The project of steam upon the Volga is now talked of, and a com pany is formed to carry the scheme into effect ; great doubts, however, appear to be entertained as to the practicability and success of the undertaking. I do not understand the diffi culties, but I believe they arise partly from shallows or other natural obstacles in the river, and partly from the opposition of persons interested in maintaining the present system of traffic. Were the proposal executed, the steam-vessels would run from Yaroslav to Kazan and Astrakan.* After dinner we set off on our return to Yaroslav, and arrived here a little before midnight. The 29th, being St. Sophia, was the name's-day of Madame Poltoratzky, and during the whole morning numbers of visitors of all classes were con stantly arriving to congratulate her and bring her presents. Her tables were covered with china, books, embroidery, and carpet-work ; while in the large ball-room were placed two or three tubs of water, containing two sturgeons, and a quantity of sterlet alive, which had been brought by some of the tradesmen of the town. The sterlet is an excellent fish, pecu liar to the Volga and to one or two other rivers: it partakes of the migratory habits of the salmon, descending periodically into salt-water. It is hot, however, the least like the salmon in flavour or appearance. We had a large party- at dinner, including five or six bearded tradesmen in their long caftans ; and one of the sturgeons which appeared on the occasion proved excellent. The daj was concluded by a ball. On Sunday- we went to hear the Archbishop perform mass in the church of his convent ; the service being different from * See Oliphant's ' Russian Shores of the Black Sea in 1852,' when steam power had been introduced on the Volga."], [94, "MASS IN THE GREEK CHURCH.

The Archbishop was magnificently dressed in a robe of crimson velvet em broidered with gold, with the ribbons and crosses of various orders round his neck. On his head he had a mitre, also of crimson velvet, covered with jewels; the mitre is not cloven, but is a high cap with a round top bulging out. At the con clusion he stood before the altar, while his mitre and the robes in which he had officiated were taken off by the priests in attendance. A monk's gown, with two stars on the breast, was then put on, as well as a monk's cap ; the crosses were replaced around his neck, and the Archbishop walked out of the church, blessing the congregation as he went. He was a little old man, apparently much more feeble and infirm than his predecessor, whom I had seen at Tolga, and who had retired owing to his age and consequent inability to perform the duties of his office. The see of Yaroslav is one of the best in Russia ; the revenues amounting to about two thousand five hundred pounds a-year. Nearly the whole service in the Greek Church is chanted, and a good deal of incense is used. The officiating priest stands during the greater part of the time with his back to the congregation, being always assisted by a deacon, who, when ever he gives him or receives from him a book in the course of the ceremony, kisses his hand. At the conclusion of mass the cross is brought forward by the priest to be kissed by the con gregation. This latter ceremony was made the means of communicating to the Empress-mother the death of the late Emperor Alexander. On hearing of the illness of her son at Taganrog, the Empress ordered a mass to be celebrated for his recovery at the Kazan church of St. Petersburg. In the middle of the service the Grand Duke Nicholas was called out and was informed that the tidings of his brother's death had ar rived. He communicated the intelligence to the Metropolitan, who was officiating, and when the latter, at the conclusion of the service, presented as usual the cross to the Empress, it was enveloped in black crape. On Monday we went to see the treasures of the convent, the church of which we had attended the day before. We were taken by a monk into a strong-room, the neglected appearance"], [95, "Let. VII.] CONVENT TREASURES. 71 of which little bespoke the riches it contained. The sides of the room were covered by miserable deal wardrobes, display ing, when opened, a great quantity of robes ; some of the richest silk or velvet of various colours embroidered with gold and silver, and others of gold or silver tissue. These, how ever, sunk into insignificance when compared with the dresses for the use of the Archbishop on high ceremonials, which were embroidered with jewels instead of gold. The most beautiful was a robe of sky-blue velvet, with a broad border and other ornaments of a beautiful pattern of leaves and flowers in fine pearls, of which nearly six pounds weight were em ployed on this suit alone. There were other robes of velvet almost equally rich, and all had mitres to match, which were absolutely covered with jewels. One mitre was valued at about five thousand pounds. There were also Bibles bound in gold and covered with jewels ; Crosses and Images set in diamonds, emeralds, and other precious stones ; and several handsome services of plate for administering the Communion. One of these services was of pure gold, richly and beautifully chased, of the weight of twelve pounds avoirdupois. The riches of this convent are chiefly owing to the munificence of the ancient princes of Yaroslav, but I am told they are nothing in comparison to the treasures which are heaped up in the con vent of Troitska, situated between this place and Moscow. The late Archbishop of Yaroslav found, on his accession to the see, that there were no less than sixty -four pounds weight of fine pearls, of which no use was made, but which were laid up in bags like seeds. Being a person of taste in such matters, he, in concert with the Abbess of a neighbouring convent, em ployed the pearls in embroidering the beautiful robes which I have just described. They have, however, still remaining unused, about eleven pounds weight of pearls. \u25a0 Besides these things they have in the church a Shrine of great size, of solid silver ; an Image set in broad frame of pearls, which must be of immense value ; and also many precious and costly articles which I have not enumerated. The interior of the church is almost covered with gilding. Although the dresses of the prelates, and even of the ordi-"], [96, "POST-HORSE SYSTEM. [Let. VII.' 72 nary priests, are made and ornamented so magnificently, the forms of the robes are exceedingly stiff and ungraceful. We have passed our time here so agreeably, and have re ceived so much kindness, that we are preparing, with no small regret, to leave Yaroslav to-morrow. Among the other attrac tions of the house must not be forgotten, in the heart of Russia, a number of modern English books which we have met with, and among the rest ' Blackwood's Magazine,' which is regularly taken in by our hostess, who understands and speaks English exceedingly well, and who occupies herself much with English literature. The kind and repeated invitations which w-e have received to prolong our stay are highly agreeable and flatter ing ; but we are obliged to shut our ears to temptation, since the season reminds us that it is time to seek our winter quar ters. My next letter will be addressed to you from Moscow, a hundred and eighty miles hence, where we shall spend a few days on our way southwards. We have been advised, instead of travelling to Moscow with post-horses, to make a bargain here with a man who un dertakes to forward us all the way- ; by which means we avoid the chance of being detained for want of horses. We have accordingly agreed with an istvostchik to pay him a sum equivalent to about five pounds ten shillings for the whole journey, with six horses ; and we have received from him a paper on which are marked the distances, and the pro portion we are to pay- at each station. The stages are some what longer than those of the regular post, but this will be no disadvantage to us, as the Russian horses possess great powers of endurance, and more time is lost by frequent changes than is gained in increase of speed. The post-horses are an important source of revenue to government, the contractors who furnish them paying highly for the privilege. At every station there is a postmaster, an officer in the imperial service, whose duty it is to prevent un necessary delay, and to ensure regularity in furnishing the horses, which are supplied sometimes by the proprietor of the village, but more often by peasants who make this their occu pation, and who are properly called yemstchiks ; they usually"], [97, "Let. VII.] FELDT-YAGERS. 73 drive their horses themselves. At each post-house is a board, on which is marked the number of horses belonging to that station, which of course is, or ought to be, proportioned to the traffic on the road. Post-horses can only be furnished to travellers on producing a padoroshna, or order, which it is necessary to obtain at a police-office before starting, and in which is inserted the place to which one is going, the distance in versts, and the number of horses which one requires. For the padoroshna the traveller pays at the rate of two kopeks per horse per verst, ten kopeks being equivalent to a penny. This duty serves to maintain the roads. The fare for each post-horse is eight kopeks between Petersburg and Moscow, and five kopeks on most other roads, per verst. To travel post in Russia, a person must either be provided with his own carriage, or content himself with a tilega, a small waggon without springs. In these the letters are conveyed by the Post-Office, and the feldt-yagers, or imperial couriers, travel in the same manner. The feldt-yagers are a class of officers set apart for this employment, and numbers of them are at all times traversing the empire in every direction, on various enands. The fatigues which they endure are so severe and injurious to the health, that they seldom last in this service above six years, dying in general of consumption. The pace which the feldt-yagers are forced to travel, in waggons without springs and over the roughest roads, is from twelve to fifteen miles an hour ; and this, day and night, for long distances, without any repose. They pay for the horses at every station, but they are not delayed many minutes, as every postmaster is obliged to have a tilega and three horses standing at all times ready in his yard, in case a courier should an-ive, and, the moment it goes out, another takes its place. The courier has only to show his padoroshna, and the tilega is driven out for him directly, the time at which he reaches and leaves each station being marked by the postmaster on the padoroshna. The feldt-yagers travel sometimes front Moscow to Petersburg, a distance of more than five hundred and twenty miles, in less than five and -thirty hours."], [98, "[Let. VIII.

Moscow, October 10th, 1837. We arrived here late last Friday night, after a journey from Yaroslav which the state of the roads rendered extremely fatiguing and disagreeable. A new line of road is in progress, but is not yet completed, and the old road is in the mean time utterly neglected. We started on Thursday morning in a hard frost, which still continues, but which had been preceded by very heavy rain. During the wet weather the mud had become very deep, and had been much cut up by wheels, while it was now as hard as stone, and rougher than any ploughed field, so that in many places it wras difficult to find a practi cable track for the carriage. Occasionally the two wheels on one side would break through the crust of ice, and plunge into a hole so deep that I thought it impossible we could recover our equilibrium, and I hardly thought we could get here without being upset. However, no accident occurred, thanks to the skill and care of the istvostchiks, who now and then left the high road for several versts at a time, and drove us along mere tracks through fields and woods. In one of the latter, the path being somewhat narrow, a young birch-tree, of about the thickness of a man's leg, got caught between the wheel and the body of the carriage, and was brought to the ground with a crash ; no harm, however, was done, though I was rather alarmed at first by the idea that the carriage itself, and not the tree, had suffered. The road, on leaving Yaroslav, lay for nearly a mile along a causeway, twenty or thirty feet high, across a low flat. A"], [99, "Let. VIII.] ARRIVAL AT MOSCOW. 75 small river, called the Medveditza, flows here into the Volga ; and, until the causeway was made, all communication was cut off between the two sides, except by boats, at the period of the annual floods ; for when the snow melts and the ice breaks up, the rivers overflow to a great height, and cover the low ground. The Medveditza was so named by an ancient prince, in commemoration of his having killed a bear single handed at the spot where it joins the Volga \u2014 rnedved, in Rus sian, signifying a bear. The arms of the province and town appear to commemorate the same event, since they consist of a bear carrying a battle-axe. Between Yaroslav and Moscow the country is much finer than any part of Russia I have yet seen. About a hundred versts hence we passed a wood of tolerably large oak-trees, being the most northerly point at which we have seen the oak. We reached a town called Periaslav about half-past nine at night ; and as we could not travel in the dark, in consequence of the state of the road, we remained there till daylight, sleeping upon a sofa and some chairs, and wrapped up in our cloaks ; for, although we got a warm and clean room in the inn, beds were a luxury not to be met with, most Russian travellers carrying their own with them. We were in the carriage again by five o'clock the next morning ; but, from the state of the road, we did not reach the gates of Moscow till half-past twelve at night. Here my passport was shown, and we were immediately admitted, and found ourselves, with no small degree of satisfaction, tra versing the streets of the ancient city, which were dimly lighted and empty, and through which we drove for more than an hour before we reached our journey's end. We are lodged in my father-in-law's house, which is empty and dis mantled, the family being in the country ; however, we make ourselves tolerably comfortable during our short stay, and we spend, as you may suppose, most of our time out of doors. M \u2014 has fortunately a married sister living here, who, with her husband, has been very kind in going about with us to see the sights, and to act as interpreter. The first step to take on the morning after our arrival was to engage a carriage ; and we have a very neat and comfortable"], [100, "[Let. Vlir. 76 MOSCOW : THE KREMLIN. chariot with four horses, for about thirteen shillings a-day. It arrives at whatever time we order it in the morning, and it remains at our disposal till we come home, as late as we please at night ; standing, whenever we are not using it, in the cour. yard. The horses are fed when necessary with nose bags ; but they never enter a stable, and are never taken off the carriage all day. We went first to visit the relations whom I have mentioned, who live at some distance on the further side of the river Moskva. I was not aware that we should pass near the Kremlin on our way, and the view of it, which burst upon us unexpectedly on reaching the bridge, was by far the most striking; thins; of the kind I ever saw. The Kremlin stands in the middle of the city, on an elevation, the base of which is circled by white Tartar walls, and is washed on one side by the river. The mount itself is covered by most picturesque buildings of various forms ; churches, arsenals, palaces, and towers ; while upwards of thirty gilt cupolas of various sizes, and at various heights, shoot up, and stand in relief against the sky. The whole scene has an oriental appearance, which, on my first introduction to it, was not a little enhanced in beauty by the clear blue sky, and by the bright hue which shone on the river and on the gilded roofs. The following day being Sunday we attended service in the English church, which is plain but neatly fitted up. The congregation was small and scanty ; however, the attendance is, no doubt, better in winter when the town is full. In the afternoon we went to dine with an aunt of M \u2014 's, who lived at the extreme end of the town, so that the drive served to give me a very fair idea of the extent of Moscow. It was, in fact, a complete journey to the lady's house, which, though within the gates, was almost a country residence, since there were three or four acres of land attached to it. On the out skirts of the city may still be seen a few ruined houses, which have never been rebuilt since the French invasion. In general, however, Moscow at the present day exhibits no signs of the devastation which then took place, though the scattered manner in which it is built, and the number of fine houses, which are no longer inhabited or kept up by their possessors, give a"], [101, "Let. VIII.] IMPERIAL PALACE. 77 certain air of desertion to the town, and impress one with the feeling that its glory is departed. The ancient glory of Mos cow has, indeed, taken wings for Petersburg ; but it is said that, although yearly more and more deserted by the courtly and fashionable, it is gradually rising into increased pros perity as a commercial and manufacturing capital. We have driven in various directions about the streets ; have visited the boulevards, which are numerous, and much hand somer than anything of the kind at Petersburg ; and have made a few purchases in the fashionable shops of the Black smiths' Bridge, as the Regent-street of Moscow is somewhat uncouthly named. Our chief attention, however, as you may suppose, has been devoted to the Kremlin. The view from the terrace in front of the imperial palace is most beautiful and striking ; the river, which though small greatly enhances the scene, flowing immediately beneath, and the city lying stretched out under the gazer's feet. On the highest spot of ground in the Kremlin stands a lofty slender tower, which rises high above any other point in the city. This pillar-like edifice is called Ivan Veliki, or Long John ; and from its top, to which we ascended by a time-worn winding stair, we had a most magnificent panoramic view of Moscow, and of the country around for many miles on every side. The sky was cloudless, the keen frosty air was bright and clear, and there was no smoke to obstruct the view, which I believe to be unequalled in its way. I need not describe the arsenal, which contains arms for a hundred and forty thousand foot-soldiers, and for eighty thousand cavalry, all apparently arranged in excellent order ; nor the cannon, some of enormous size, which have at different periods been taken in action, and which are arranged in the square outside the arsenal. The imperial palace contains a fine room, of singular form, richly decorated, and hung with crimson velvet, studded with the imperial eagle, and with the cipher of Nicholas I., in gold. There is a throne in the room ; and here the Emperor receives the congratulations of his subjects and of the foreign ambassadors immediately after his coronation, which takes place in the cathedral church, a small ancient building close by. A small set of apartments, which in former days formed"], [102, "[Let. VIII. 78 MOSCOW : THE GREAT BELL. at once the abode and the prison of the grand-duchesses for the time being, is curious, as showing how the Russian prin cesses were then lodged. These apartments consist of three or four small rooms, the windows of which are formed of small panes of coloured glass, affording no view but that of an old church opposite. The furniture is rich, but scanty and com fortless ; for though the apartments have been recently fresh painted and re-gilt, the old ornaments and decorations are merely restored without any alteration or addition. In this small and cheerless dwelling were the daughters of the Czar, whether few or many, brought up and immured in ancient times, never being allowed to go forth until the day of their marriage. The remainder of the palace is in no way remarkable, either as curious or splendid ; but the prospect from the windows is magnificent, standing as the palace does on the elevated ground of the Kremlin, and raised above the town ; and perhaps no sovereign in Europe has so fine a site as this for a residence in his capital. A new and magnificent palace has been determined on, and its erection will, I am told, be shortly commenced. I must not forget the \"great bell of Moscow,\" which can now be seen to much advantage. It was cast in the year 1733 ; but, soon after it was hung, it fell and buried itself in the ground. In this state it remained until the year 1836, when, by orders of the Emperor, it was with some dif ficulty raised, and placed upon a circular wall about four feet high, on which it now stands. An iron gate in the wall enables one to see the interior of the bell, the diameter of which within is about fourteen feet, its weight being upwards of a hundred and eighty tons. A piece, which is now placed by its side, was broken out of the bell in its fall ; and this fracture enables one to see the thickness of the metal, which is about half a yard. There is a bell now hanging in the Kremlin which weighs between ninety and a hundred tons, and which is rung twelve times a year. It takes three men to move the clapper for the pur pose, the bell itself, as is always the case in Russia, being fixed, and the clapper alone moveable. There is probably no country in the world where there are so many fine bells, or where"], [103, "Let. VIII.] THE HOLY GATE. 79 there is so much ringing, as in this ; but the Russians have no idea of a merry or harmonious peal, and their style of ringing is most discordant. One of the gates of the Kremlin is called the Holy Gate, and while passing through it is necessary to take off the hat. Near to this gate is a circular stone platform, surrounded by a low parapet, where criminals were formerly executed. The most ancient portion of Moscow is called the White City, and is surrounded by a wall, at one of the gates of which is placed a celebrated image of the Virgin, covered with dia monds and other jewels of great value. This image, which is endowed according to popular belief with miraculous virtues, is often carried to sick persons in their houses, and there is a copy with paste diamonds and false jewels, which does duty at home during the absence of the original, and which is found, we may presume, to be equally efficacious. Near the Holy Gate of the Kremlin stands the church of St. Basil, an ancient building, remarkable not only for the singularity of its architecture and its spiral ornaments, but also for the fate of the architect, whose eyes were put out, as soon as he had completed the work, by his master, John the Cruel, in order that he might never build anything else like it. One of the most remarkable modern buildings in Moscow is the Exercise-house, a magnificent room, in which troops of all arms are drilled and man\u0153uvred in winter. Eight thousand men can, I am told, be exercised in it at once. The floor is covered with fine gravel, and the room is effectually wanned by means of stoves at the corners and sides. Its dimensions are about five hundred and sixty feet by a hundred and forty five, with a proportionable height, and the roof is ingeniously supported without the aid of pillars. I was not so much struck by the immense size of this gigantic room on first en tering, as when afterwards, on casting my eyes around, I saw here and there carts bringing in fresh gravel or water for laying the dust ; the perspective calling my attention to the enor mous proportions of the building.

Rascazava, near Tamboff, October 27th, 1837. According to the calendar it is still but autumn, and even here we are now enjoying nidd weather, yet I confess I felt much inclined a short time ago to believe it was winter, though I found it by no means disagreeable. While we were at Mos cow we had ten degrees of frost by Reaumur, and since we came here we have had some days almost equally cold. This temperature was, however, generally compensated by a bright sun, and I was in no way disposed to complain of the season. The Russians will never allow that winter has begun, how ever cold it may be, until the snow has fallen and sledging has commenced. We left Moscow, according to our intentions, on Wednesday, the 11th of this month, in the afternoon, and, travelling day and night without stopping, we arrived at this house on the Saturday at the same hour, having been exactly three days on the road. Here M \u2014 and I met with a most warm reception from her brother * and his wife, who are exceedingly kind, and with whom we spend our time most comfortably and plea santly. In the course of the first stage from Moscow we met with an accident which at first looked rather formidable, though in the end no one was hurt, and w-e were soon enabled to proceed. The road had been for some time sandy and heavy, so that we had gone at a gentle pace, till in a long straggling village, about twelve miles from Moscow, we suddenly in creased our speed, and presently found ourselves driving along * While this edition is preparing for the press, the painful intelligence of his death has reached us. G"], [106, "82 ACCIDENT ON THE ROAD. [Let. IX. at full gallop. We had not, however, proceeded far at this pace before the carriage was stopped with a jerk, and we at the same time heard a violent cracking of wood. The door of the carriage was instantly opened, and when we got out we beheld a very curious scene. On one side was a tilega half upset, with a man and a woman thrown out of it into a ditch, but happily unhurt. The horses which drew it were struggling violently, being entangled in their harness. Our six post-horses, moreover, were lying on the ground in a heap. The near wheeler (of four) was struggling with his hind quarters under the carriage, between the fore and the hind w-heels ; another of the wheelers was on his back, with his heels up in the air, and fast in the rope-traces. The two others were in different positions, and the leaders, strange to say, were undermost, with their heads turned the contrary way to that in which we were going. The postilion's horse was lying stretched on his side unable to move, with his head and shoulders under the fore-axle, and his companion was in nearly the same position. The pole was snapped across in the middle. The peasant in the tilega was drunk, and had caused this accident by driving against us or our horses. The shock, which, as we were going at full gallop, was very great, threw down the leaders ; the wheelers then fell over them, the horses all getting entangled in the rope harness ; and the carriage was stopped by running on the horses. How the leaders in falling got their heads turned round where their tails had been I cannot explain, but such was the fact. Our first inquiries naturally were as to the fate of the pos tilion, and we had the great satisfaction of finding that, though he must have fallen with his horse, he had contrived to roll himself immediately out of the way, amd had escaped com pletely unhurt. If he had not got clear of the other horses and of the carriage, he must inevitably have been crushed to death ; and his escape was most wonderful. At the first appearance of affairs, I thought that some of the horses must be disabled, and that our broken pole would at any rate be the cause of a long delay. However, a number of people assembled, and, without cutting a single rope or strap, they succeeded in about half an hour in releasing all the"], [107, "Let. IX.] ECLIPSE OF THE MOON. 83 horses ; none of which, when we saw them on their legs, appeared to be seriously hurt, although the road, on which they had fallen, must have been tolerably hard from the frost, which had now lasted more than a week. The next consideration was the broken pole ; but with the handiness and ready contrivance which seem innate to this people, our Russian attendant proceeded to splice the two pieces together with a rope and a piece of wood. The ope ration did not last five minutes, but the repair was so well and effectually done, that the pole, which was never meddled with again till we reached our journey's end, was then as firm as ever ; and w-e might have travelled with it in that state back again to Moscow. In about three quarters of an hour from the moment of the stoppage we were enabled to proceed, and we met with no further adventures in the course of the journey. Early the following morning we reached the town of Columna, about eighty miles from Moscow ; and passing through one or two small towns in the course of the day, we got to Riazan, a con siderable place and the capital of a government, by seven in the evening. We proceeded, as I have already said, without resting ; and on the Friday night we drank tea at Kazloff, reaching the town of Tamboff, about three-and-twenty miles hence, to breakfast the following morning. The road most part of the way was tolerable, as the weather was dry. It was in general enormously wide, and being unstoned it resembled a rough ploughed field, through which the narrow beaten track meandered like a footpath. The country was but little wooded after the first half of our journey, and from Kazloff to Tamboff, a distance of fifty miles, it was entirely open, and in fact a steppe. The moon, the night that we traversed this district, was at the full, but about eleven o'clock it began, to our great sur prise, to fail us, and at length the darkness became so great that our yemstchik stopped, declaring that he could not see his horses, much less the road, which is at all times very easily lost in these unenclosed plains. With some lucifer-matches which we had in the carriage we lighted one of the lamps, the other being useless, owing to a broken glass ; and the servant G 2"], [108, "[Let. IX. 84 COUNTRY NEAR TAMBOFF. on the box was obliged to hold the light in his hand, and occasionally to walk with it before the horses ; by which means we managed to creep along at a foot's pace till about two o'clock in the morning, when the moon began to re-appear. Two or three days ago I was looking at an almanac, and I perceived that, although on this occasion we had selected the period of a full moon for our journey, we had unwittingly fallen on the night of a total eclipse. In travelling over Russian roads, moonshine becomes a matter of considerable importance: On reaching the town of Tamboff I was told that the road to this place was so heavy, that it would be necessary to put extra horses to the carriage. Accordingly, when we got into the vehicle again, we found no less than nine horses tackled to it \u2014 six wheelers abreast, driven from the box, and three leaders with a postilion mounted in the middle. This drove of animals, however, we found by no means superfluous, for a great part of the road lay through a heavy sand, so deep that the horses sunk in it to the fetlocks, and the fellies of the wheels were covered. The general character of this part of the country is open plain or steppe, unclothed by trees. Immediately around this spot, however, are very extensive woods of oak and Scotch fir. The former is mere copse and brushwood, but much of tho fir timber is large and fine. The soil, where not covered by sand, consists in general of a rich deep black mould, entirely free from stone, and producing heavy crops without manure.* In addition to the usual produce of Russia, large quantities of a particular kind of cucumber, to be salted for winter use, are grown in the fields in this district. The neighbouring woods abound in hares and foxes, and in blackcock. They are also much infested by wolves. Snipes and woodcocks, and the double-snipe, are plentiful earlier in the year ; but they have now taken flight for the winter. The cock-of-the woods, or capercailzie, is not very rare, and a few days ago we surprised an eagle eating a hare.

Rabbits, I believe, are not to be found in Russia, and I have never seen a donkey. We are to spend the winter in the town of Tamboff, to which place we are going shortly for a few days to see a large fair of horses and goods of every kind, which is held annually at this season. A country fair in this central province \u2014 for w-e are nearly equidistant from Petersburg, Odessa, and Astrakan, the Baltic, the Black Sea, and the Caspian \u2014 can hardly fail to present some new and interesting pictures of Russian cha racter and Russian life. I am much pleased with the oppor tunity thus offered to me, and when w-e return you shall have some description of what we have seen. My brother-in-law will have business as well as pleasure to occupy him at the fair, for since our arrival he has received a consignment of nine thorough-bred horses from an aunt of his wife, a Princess Mada toff, who has a breeding stud on her estate in Georgia, near the Araxes. One of these horses is intended as a present to my brother-in-law, and two others are for a nephew of the proprietress, while the remaining six are to be sold at the fair. At present, therefore, we have seven at our disposal, and we amuse ourselves by exercising some of them daily. Most of these are hot showy horses, and they all have imposing pedigrees, the translation of which commences, as you will anticipate, with \" In the name of the Prophet.\" The estate from which these horses come is close to the frontier of Persia. They are accustomed, when turned out to graze, to be picketed by one hind foot to a stake, which is moved when necessary. The person in whose charge they have been sent gives a won derful account of the luxuriance of the grass in his country, which he says is abundantly irrigated in summer by the melting of the snow on their lofty mountains, up the sides of which, as the heat increases, they, like the Swiss herdsmen, gradually move their animals to higher elevations to graze. You will think that we are living in a semi-Asiatic family ; but my brother-in-law and his wife speak excellent English, and their relative, Princess Madatoff, is a very good Christian, and no doubt an accomplished lady of European tastesand habits, though she resides among a Mahometan population in Asia."], [110, "FAIR AT TAMBOFF.

Rascazava, November 10th, 1837. We returned into the country, a few days ago, from Tamboff, where we spent a week, to see the fair of which I made men tion in my last letter, and which was instituted, it seems, in commemoration of the finding- of an image of the Virgin, which is now at Veronish, and which, like the Palladium, was sent down from heaven, and at length discovered, after having been hid for many years on earth. The fair is not held in the town for fear of fire, but on an extensive steppe or down, about three quarters of a mile off. On this down a perfect village was erected of wooden booths, in which shops were opened for the sale of all kinds of goods, especially every article necessary for winter clothing, which was at the time exceedingly attractive, as we had a hard frost during the whole week. There were several fur-shops, very handsomely provided with skins of all kinds, and of all prices ; bear, fox, sable, beaver, wolf, and a variety of others, of which I do not know the names. Russians sometimes go to an enor mous expense in fur ; but a handsome fox-skin for a lady's cloak maybe had for about eight pounds; and a beaver collar, which is the handsomest and most agreeable fur for the pur pose, for a lady or gentleman, will cost from eight to twelve pounds. A bear-skin pelisse, which is only fit for wearing in a sledge or in travelling, costs about thirty pounds. There were also Tartar merchants, with shaven heads and skull-caps, who sold shawls, dressing-gowns, slippers, and all kinds of eastern manufactures ; while close by them were drapers, silk-"], [111, "Let. X.] FAIR AT TAMBOFF. 87 mercers, and all the tradesmen requisite to furnish a lady's toilette, with goods home-made or imported from England or France. The shopkeepers were all wrapped up in furs, for the booths were bitterly cold. Who would expect, at a country fair, to find church-bells for sale ! There were a number of all sizes, some being of a very considerable weight of metal. They were hung on wooden frames in an open space, so that a customer could easily ring them to judge of their tones. I was told that there was always a certain demand for these bells at the fair. A number of fire-engines were stationed round the booths, to be useful not only in the event of fire, but as assistants to the police in keeping order ; since, in case of a mob of drunken and disorderly people assembling at night, an engine playing into the midst of them speedily disperses the crowd. The horse-fair altogether presented a most curious scene. A large space of the steppe was thickly covered with tilegas, or little waggons, behind which the horses for sale were tied ; and the strange figures of the people in their sheepskin coats and fur caps, with their long beards, had anything but an European character. In one part of the fair were to be seen showy horses, covered with gaudy cloths in bright colours, and tied three or four together behind tilegas, where from time to time they created a disturbance by kicking aud fighting with their companions or neighbours. Among these were our six eastern steeds, destined by their owner to procure for her self a plentiful harvest of roubles, and to become sires of renown in the breeding studs of Tamboff. The former expec tation, at least, will have been much disappointed, for unfor tunately such horses were not now in demand. In another quarter were Tartars bargaining for miserable worn-out animals, such as in England may be seen awaiting their time in the paddock adjoining a kennel ; but which the Tartar pur chases as food, not fur his dogs but for himself; horse-flesh being the principal fare of these Russian Mahometans, who are tolerably numerous in this neighbourhood. In another part of the fair, again, were dealers from the Don, with large lots of Cossack and Bashkir horses. The Cossack horse is small, raw-boned, and spare, carrying little"], [112, "[Let. X. 88 BREAKING-IN COLTS. flesh, and apparently not equal to any great weight ; but he is far better than he looks, and is hardy, active, and enduring : he is little used for harness, his master being a horseman bred and born. The Bashkir horse is short and punchy, with a thick neck and a dull heavy head ; but he will travel seventy miles without stopping or tiring. The Cossack and Bashkir horses at the fair were chiefly wild unbroken colts, and they were not haltered like the rest, or tied behind tilegas, but enclosed twenty or thirty together, in pens surrounded by a strong railing. In each pen was a lad with a whip, who kept the horses moving slowly round and round. It was amusing to watch the process of showing these colts to purchasers. When a customer fixed his eye on one of them, and wished to examine him and see his action, the dealer, with the help of a long stick, threw a noose over the horse's head, and pulled it tight round his throat. The bar which closed the pen was then let down, and the lad inside, keeping the other horses away from the opening, drove out the one which had been selected. He, of course, finding himself apparently free on the open plain, immediately tried to run away ; but his escape was not to be effected, for his owner had a firm hand on the rope round his neck, and a vigorous pull tightened the noose so as almost to strangle the horse. The assistant, having now closed the pen, came to his master's aid ; and having forced a bridle on the head of the poor frightened brute, boldly jumped on his back. The colt naturally re sented the aggression by rearing, kicking, plunging, and doing all in his power to rid himself of his unceremonious rider. The Cossack, however, held fast by the mane, clung tightly with his legs, and kept a firm seat. Presently he urged on the horse, his master still holding the rope round the animal's neck. After a minute or two the colt became more tranquil ; the end of the rope was given to the rider, and he was left to take care of himself. He immediately set off at full gallop across the steppe, and returned after a while at the same pace, pulling up with some difficulty when he reached the spot from which he had started. This process, which I saw followed with two or three horses, reminded me of the account given by Sir Francis"], [113, "Let. X.] TROTTING MATCHES. 89 Head, in his ' Journey across the Pampas,' of the manner of breaking in wild horses in South America. The Cossack dealers had their own riding-horses, saddled and bridled, tied to the railings of the pens, and every now and then a couple of them would mount, and, starting off at full gallop, have a wild race against one another across the steppe. The ground was hard and slippery from the frost, but these fellows appeared to fear neither for themselves nor their horses, though one of them, who was neither young nor light, met with rather an awkward tumble ; however, he ap peared to care nothing for it. He was coming at full speed down hill, and, not having pulled up in time, he was obliged to turn on one side to avoid the crowd ; and in so doing his horse slipped and fell flat on his side. I expected the rider to be considerably hurt, but he was instantly on his legs, urged up his horse, mounted, and set off again at full gallop across the plain. The Cossacks, who appear to be the only Russians much given to horsemanship, ride with snaffle bridles and upon a peaked saddle, with a leather cushion girthed upon it, so that they sit very high. They have a very peculiar seat, riding rather on one side, looking to the right, with the right toe and knee pointing out, and the left pressed closely to the horse. They wear no spurs, but carry a whip of pig-skin, looking like a small flail, in their hands. Adjoining the space which was occupied by the horse-fair is a race-course for trotting-matches, w-hich are greatly in vogue in Russia at present. Great attention is paid, especially in this part of the country, to breeding fast trotters, which often command very high prices. They are many of them as large and handsome as London cabriolet horses. We saw some of these horses in training every evening on the race-course. They are driven in light droschkas ; the vehicle being simply a board about four or five feet long, covered with a cushion, and placed on four low wheels. On this bench the driver sits astride, with his feet resting on iron bars, which project on either side for this purpose. When a trotter is in training, a boy on another horse generally- gallops by his side to excite him ; and the art of driving them is as carefully studied as jockeyship is in England. In winter a place is marked out"], [114, "90 TOWN OF TAMBOFF. [Let. X. with branches of trees on the ice for trotting-matches, and a light sledge is used instead of a droschka. I have not much to say in praise of the beauty of Tamboff as a town. From the scarcity of stone, it consists chieffy of wooden houses, and only one or two of the principal streets are paved. In the others the mud in wet weather is ploughed with ruts axle-deep ; and frost having now succeeded rain, and these roads having become as hard as stone, they are in a condition to endanger breaking the wheels of the carriages and the legs of the horses. Like all government towns in Russia, Tamboff boasts an Archbishop and a Monastery. There is also a Nunnery there, and a certain number of churches, but none of them are re markable. The government house has a most dismal appear ance ; and the only building in the place of any pretension is the Hall of Assembly of the nobles. This edifice contains a fine room, with a gallery running round three sides, supported on Corinthian pillars. At the upper end is a marvellously bad portrait of the Emperor under a canopy. His Majesty's por trait is usually placed in all public rooms, the pictures being for the most part unvarying copies of one original. The Em peror is depicted in uniform, with leather breeches and jack boots ; and he looks sternly over a green and blue landscape to the right, his cocked-hat being in his right hand, and his left thumb stuck into his sash, apparently to relieve him from its exceeding pressure. The nobles, that is to say the gentlemen, of every Govern ment in Russia form an Assembly, in which every one who owns within the province a hundred peasants is entitled to vote. They meet once in three years to elect a Marshal for each district, of which there are twelve in every province, and a Grand-Marshal for the whole Government. The latter stands next in rank to the governor. He has the title of Excellency and the grade of General while he remains in office, and, if he is elected three several times, he retains his rank for life. After being elected, he must be confirmed in his office by the Emperor before he can enter on his functions. These Mar shals represent the nobles, and they meet from time to time for the transaction of business ; but the General Assembly of nobles"], [115, "Let. X.] ASSEMBLY OF THE NOBLES. 91 cannot meet oftener than triennially, except by an extraordi nary permission from the Emperor. The business of the Assembly relates chiefly to the management and disposal of funds raised by a voluntary- rate among themselves for the establishment and maintenance of public institutions, such as schools, hospitals, etc. The wardship of minors, of lunatics, and even of spendthrifts among their own number, is vested in the hands of the nobles, the business being practically conducted by their representatives the Marshals. Moreover, if a noble is injuring his children by wasting his estate, the Assembly have the power, which is not unfrequently- exercised, of taking the management of his property into their own hands for the benefit of his family, and of putting him upon an allowance. At the meeting of the Assembly, thirteen tables are placed in the great hall, one for the Grand-Marshal of the govern ment, and one for the nobles of each district, with their Marshal as their chairman. A government in Russia may be considered as a county, and the districts into which it is divided as corresponding to our English hundreds. When the Grand-Marshal proposes a question, he assembles the twelve Marshals at his own table, and addresses himself to them. Each of them then goes to the table of his district and puts the question, after it has been discussed, to the vote. Having thus ascertained the decision of the majority of his consti tuents, he returns to the Grand-Marshal's table and gives his voice accordingly, the question being thus finally decided by the majority of districts. Any member of the Assembly may propose a question. In this case, it is first discussed and put to the vote at the table to which the proposer belongs. If it be rejected there, it is of course at once lost; but if it be carried, the Marshal of the district reports it to the Grand-Marshal, who puts it to the vote of the meeting in the manner described above. In this way the nobles assess themselves voluntarily for various purposes of public utility according to the number of peasants possessed by each. Their vote receives the ratifica tion of the Em | eror, and it is then binding on all ; and payment of the contributions, though originally voluntary, can be legally enforced."], [116, "92 ACCIDENT TO THE EMPEROR. [Let. X. The election of the Marshals is by ballot. In case of the Grand-Marshal being ill, or from any other cause incapacitated from attending to his duties, the Marshal of the district in which the government town is situated supplies his place ad interim. The functions of the Assembly are very narrowly limited, and the discussion in it of political questions is alto gether prohibited. Its existence, nevertheless, may possibly hereafter prove the germ of freer institutions. Its powers may be developed, and the habit thus acquired of electing repre sentatives and of discussing public questions may be extended to the purposes of legislation and government. We have just received accounts of the Emperor having been in great danger from the overturning of his carriage, near Tifflis, in Georgia. Considering the pace at which he insists upon being driven, and the roads over which he travels, it is surprising he does not more frequently meet with accidents. Nor is this the first which has befallen him. Two years ago he was overturned, and broke his collar-bone. Indeed he is very generally blamed for the manner in which in his frequent journey_ he risks his life, considering how valuable that life is to the preservation of internal peace and tranquillity in Russia. No one can foresee the result should any unfortunate accident place his successor, while as yet young and inexperienced, on the imperial throne ; but Nicholas himself has a character and a prestige which smothers rebellion, and at least silences disaffection. The accident which has just occurred happened as follows. At Tifflis, the master of police put the horses belonging to the fire-engines to the Emperor's carriage. These, being high couraged animals, unlike the ordinary posters, were not easy to manage ; and, unfortunately, an istvostchik who was not used to the horses was put on the box, in place of the man wdio usually had the charge of them, but whom it was con trary to certain regulations to employ on this occasion because he was a soldier. In descending a steep mountain by a zigzag road over hanging a precipice, the wheel not having been locked, the horses refused to hold, and broke into a gallop ; and at length, at a corner, the leaders, instead of taking the proper turn,"], [117, "Let. X.] HIS SEVERITY. 93 jumped over the low parapet, against w-hich the caleche was dashed and was upset with violence, the front part of it being knocked to pieces. The Cossack soldiers who were escorting the Emperor immediately cut the traces, and the leaders fell down the precipice, the postilion fortunately escaping un injured. Count Orloff, the Imperial aide-de-camp, was thrown out of the carriage, and had his shoulder dislocated. The Emperor fell over him, and was received in the arms of the officer of Cossacks, to whom, seeing he was much alarmed, he said, \" Don't *be frightened, I am not hurt.\" He then shook himself to ascertain the fact, crossed himself, and thanked God for having preserved him, and presently mounted a horse, and rode fifteen miles to the next station, where he got another carriage, and proceeded on his journey. He travels at the rate of from fifteen to eighteen miles an hour, being preceded by an avant-courier, so that he finds horses always waiting, and the time which he allows for changing is but two minutes. It is said that the Emperor went into Georgia on the present occasion for the especial purpose of rectifying certain abuses and acts of tyranny which had been reported to him. The result of his visit was, that justice was done, and the delin quent officers were punished. Among others the colonel of a re giment and son-in-law to the Governor of Tifflis was convicted of numerous acts of cruelty and malversation. The Emperor ordered his epaulettes to be stripped off ; and seeing that every one hesitated to obey his orders, he tore them off with his own hands, and then he presented them, as a symbol of promotion, to the governor's son, expressing a hope that the new colonel would do them credit. That the sovereign should thus with his own hand execute his own sentence is not quite in accord ance with our ideas of dignity ; but in Russian eyes such an act would doubtless tell ; and we hear that the Emperor has acquired much popularity in Georgia by his prompt but just severity. He has incurred perils by sea as well as by land during this autumn ; for in one of his late excursions on the Black Sea, his steam-vessel was nearly driven on shore, and was in con siderable danger in a storm.

Rascazava, November 14th, 1837. As we are now leading a life not very fertile in incidents, I may perhaps interest you by a few remarks and observations on the social habits and character of the Russians, and on the relative positions of various ranks and classes, beginning with the nobles or landed gentry. Few Russians of this class spend the winter in the country is they can avoid it, for to be there when the ground is covered with snow, and all out-door occupations and amusements fail, implies absolute banishment from the civilized world ; for society, which then becomes doubly requisite, becomes at the same time unattainable. To some the want of this enjoyment may perhaps be supplied by books, but in general the Russians are not a literary people, and those who have a taste for read ing have but scanty means of gratifying it, especially at a distance from Petersburg. Russian literature is, lam assured, daily improving ; but still it is admitted on all hands that those whose reading is limited to this language must be con tented with a very moderate amount of general information. Although, however, this defect is in a great measure remedied by the universal knowledge of French possessed by the upper classes, added to a very general acquaintance with the German, and even to a certain extent with the English language, yet books are dear ; and there are none of the arrangements which in England bring them more or less within the reach of all who are sufficiently educated to profit by them."], [120, "[Let. XI. WANT OF COUNTRY AMUSEMENTS. 96 The censorship, moreover, presses with a dead weight upon literature, by the number of publications which it prohibits or mutilates ; many of which are those which would tend most to open the minds of the people, but which the government for that very reason excludes. Newspapers, though they are not mmerous, are indeed to be seen in every house ; but all po -itical speculations, all remarks on acts of the government, all discussions as to the qualifications of public officers, or as to the results and tendencies of public events, are rigidly pro hibited ; while a great deal of information as to what is actually massing in the world is carefully suppressed. These journals, herefore, contain little beyond a meagre summary of scanty news ; a notification of officers who have received decorations, promotions, or appointments ; an imperial ukase or ordinance ; and an account of the movements of the Emperor or Empress. It is not surprising, then, that a taste for reading should, in ordinary cases, be checked, since the field of literature is so much confined, and since a large class of subjects, including those of most general and exciting interest, are carefully ex cluded from discussion. However, without dwelling further on this subject, solitude must have more than her ordinary charms to make any one voluntarily choose to spend in the country the long and dreary winter of this climate. The Russian, therefore, considers his country-place merely as a summer residence, and even then he very commonly regards it as an absolute retirement, where he enjoys little society even among his neighbours, and into which a stranger can seldom be expected to penetrate. Town he looks upon as the scene of all pleasure and refinement, and he therefore takes comparatively few pains to render his country-house enjoyable or luxurious. He has no country amusements to tempt guests to his house, for few Russians have any taste for field-sports. Neither has he any higher inducements to attach him to his estate. He has not many public duties to perform, he possesses little influence beyond his absolute authority over his serfs and he feels little pride in his inheritance. The Russian has in truth no independent position of his own, being almost entirely what it pleases the Emperor to make him."], [121, "Let. XL] A COUNTRY SEAT.' 97 The estate of the father must at his death be subdivided in certain fixed proportions among his children,* so that it becomes useless to expend money in creating or embellishing a residence which the son, to whom it will hereafter belong, may not have the means of keeping up. The consequence of this system, and of the indefinite multi plication of titles, is, that there is no independent hereditary aristocracy in Russia, no influence of property, and little re spect or attachment to families in their own neighbourhood. The inhabitants of the country consist solely of the owners of the soil and the serfs. The owner looks upon his estate, not with the pride and pleasure of an English gentleman, but simply as the source of a certain annual revenue ; and his serfs know that, so long as he is their master, they must obey him and labour for him ; while, if the estate passes into other hands, they must do the same to-morrow for their new lord. 'Where there is slavery on one side and absolute power on the other, voluntary and sincere attachment on the part of the inferior, if it ever be found, must be regarded as an exception to a general rule. Among those of the same class, the question in Russia is, not who a man may be by birth, talent, or merit, but what the Emperor may have made him ; whether his epaulettes be those of a General or of a Subaltern. The handsome, substantial country-seat of the English landowner, with its park or well-wooded lawn, is little known in Russia. The -utmost that is usually attempted is a pretty villa with no ornamental ground beyond the garden ; which is merely divided by a fence from a high road, a dirty village street, or an open plain. The garden itself is generally large in proportion to the place, but it is indifferently kept, and it has a natural deficiency, very striking to English eyes, in the total absence of evergreens, and of the less hardy plants and trees ; excepting those which are kept under glass in the winter. * The law apportions one-seventh of a man's landed property to his widow for ever, one-fourteenth to each daughter, and the remainder in equal portions among his sons. Every one is, therefore, but a life-tenant on his estate ; yet such is the inconsistency of the law, that he may waste it or cut down \"timber, as he pleases; or he may sell the land and dispcse of the purchase-money as he chooses, either in his lifetime or by will. II"], [122, "98 DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS. [Let. XI. For the interior arrangement of the houses, the custom is to have as many rooms as possible, opening en suite. If the reception-rooms are on the first floor, the ground tier is low and reserved for servants' rooms, offices, &c. The kitchen is generally in a detached building. The bed-room of the master and mistress of the house is usually connected with the drawing-room or saloon by folding doors, which stand open all day, so that any one who pleases may enter.* Sometimes a folding screen runs across the room, so as to conceal the bed, which, however, when the lady has a separate dressing-room, is often exposed to view, unencumbered with hangings, but covered by a handsome silk quilt : while the toilette-table displays the usual silver boxes and cut-glass bottles which belong to a handsome dress ing-case. Russian rooms in general boast by no means the same amount of comfort and the same luxury of furniture which is usual in England. The sofas are stiff and hard, and the chairs and tables heavy and clumsy, castors being seldom used. The walls, instead of being papered or painted, are in gene ral merely whitewashed or coloured. The preposterous ex pense of really good furniture necessarily confines it to the houses, and chiefly to the town-houses, of a veiy few rich people. A Petersburg tradesman will doubtless fit up a house with the utmost luxury and with great good taste ; but his charges, I am told, will be double those of a first-rate London upholsterer. Refinement cannot be considered as naturalised in any country till it can be indulged in at a reasonable price, so as to become habitual to the people at large. To return to Russian rooms. The floors are generally bare, with the exception of a small carpet in one corner ; but they are composed of inlaid wood, or of boards painted in imitation of such work. Almost every apartment, without excepting the bed-rooms, * In the bed-room is always a little open cupboard, filled with images or rather pictures, of saints, set in gold and silver frames; before which a lamp or two is kept burning. In the corner of every room in the house is hung an image. For this reason it is considered extremely disrespectful to keep on a hat for a moment on entering a house, or even a shop."], [123, "Let. XL] MANAGEMENT OF PEASANTS. 99 is a passage ; an inconvenience to which Russians do not appear at all sensible. Since there are no bells, except one perhaps communicating from the saloon into the ante-room, the masters cannot, as in England, live in one part of the house while their servants live in another, to the mutual com fort of both parties ; nor can the doors be always shut, on every thing that should lie behind the scenes. Here the foot man must be close to the saloon, the valet must be within call of his master, and the maids must be next door to the bed-room of their mistress ; each in general sleeping bj- night where he or she sat by day. Having described the Russian gentleman's residence, we now come to the consideration of his property, which he reckons, not by the annual income of his estate, but by the number of souls, that is of male peasants, which it contains. The fair sex is never counted in the census. 'A Russian, in stead of an estate worth so many thousand roubles a-year, talks of possessing so many hundred souls. This is the term com monly used in speaking of the peasants, and its restriction to the male sex is one of the many Russian customs which betray an Asiatic origin. Early mairiages are much encouraged among the serfs, as it is the great object of most landed proprietors to increase the population on their estates. The marriage of girls of all ranks under the age of sixteen years is now forbidden by law, and the punishment for such a marriage, even if the offence be not discovered for years after its commission, is the separation of the husband and wife, with the imprisonment of the latter in a convent for life. The footing on which the agricultural serf practically stands towards his master is, in most respects, that of a small tenant ; the principal difference being that he cannot change his em ployment or move from home without his master's leave, which however is sometimes obtained in consideration of a certain annual payment called obrok, in lieu of service.* As a gene ral rule, the serf has a house and a portion of land, for which he pays rent in labour instead of money. He works three * For this subject more at large, see ' Details of Russian Husbandry ' &c. H 2"], [124, ":[let. xi. 100 FASTS. days in the week for his master, and has the remainder of his time at his own disposal. A day's labour of a man includes that of his wife and his horse when requisite. The peasants are under the immediate authority of one of their own number elected by themselves, and called the Starosta, or Elder, of the village. This person acts as a bailiff, receiving the orders of the master or his steward, and super intending the people when at work, as well as maintaining order in the village. These peasants, who are for the most part in a state of the grossest ignorance, are perfect predestinarians or fatalists ; and this doctrine serves as an excuse on all occasions for their habitual improvidence and want of forethought. If a child dies from neglect, or a colt is destroyed by the wolves because it was left in the field at night, the peasant says it was the will of God. Sometimes he examines his colt's teeth, and cunningly judges by certain signs whether it is fated to become food for wolves. This investigation at once shifts all trouble and respon sibility off his own shoulders ; since, if the animal is born to be devoured, of course no precautions can avert its destiny ; while, in the contrary case, they would be obviously superfluous. The peasants are very strict in their observance of the severe fasts of the Greek church, which occupy more than half the year, including every Wednesday and Friday, and the eve of every feast. During these fasts they taste neither meat nor milk, butter, eggs, nor cheese, on some occasions even abstain ing from the use of fish. Among the upper classes these fasts are almost entirely neglected by the gentlemen, as not agreeing with their health. The ladies for the most part observe some of the fasts, which they regard as more sacred than the others ; and some few of them scrupulously obey the rule of the church throughout. Among the domestic servants and the trading class the rale is, I believe, universally obeyed in its utmost rigour ; but it is the poor peasant who chiefly feels the suffering and privation which it entails, since he has none of the luxurious substitutes for his ordinary diet which his richer neighbour enjoys. After all, unenviable and degraded as is the lot of the Rus sian serf, he seems in general happy and contented, and he"], [125, "Let. XL] MANAGEMENT OF ESTATES. 101 exhibits little consciousness of oppression. His desires are few and easily satisfied. His fare is indeed coarse and poor, but he seldom suffers from cold or hunger ; he has few anxieties, and he is naturally gay, good-humoured, and light hearted. The nobles, however, choose their domestic servants from among their peasants, and here the case is totall}- different. The servants feel the pressure of their bondage in the caprice and ill-humour which they often have to endure, in the restraint and confinement to which they are subject, and in the constant presence before their ej-es of their master's authority and power. This is in every way- more galling and vexatious to them than to the village peasant, who has the enjoyment of his family and the comfort of his home when his task is done. The conscription is the great evil which the latter has to dread, and a most severe affliction it is when it visits him ; but of this I shall take an opportunity of speaking in a future letter. The peasant cannot legally be sold or transferred from one master to another, excepting with the whole of his family ; but this law is often broken or evaded. I have heard of an excellent cook to be disposed of for forty- pounds, and, in another case, of a useful servant who was to be had for half the money. In fact, although this trade in human flesh is forbidden, the sale of an individual is looked upon in reality as nothing extraordinary. There are few landed proprietors who do not carry on a manufactory of some kind or other, and this practice arises naturally out of the circumstances of the case. The riches of the Russian gentleman lie in the labour of his serfs, which it is his study to turn to good account,* and he is the more urged to this, since the law which compels the peasant to work for him requires him to maintain the peasant. If the latter is found begging, the former is liable to a fine. He is, therefore, a master who must always keep a certain number of workmen, whether they are useful to him or not ; and as every kind of * The income derived from an estate necessarily depends upon the system of management, and upon the profit from the labour of the peasants. 1 believe, however, that an annual revenue to the proprietor of thirty-three or thirty-four shillings per head, reckoning all the male serfs, young and old. may be taken as a fair average. The largest landed proprietor in Russia is Count Cheremetieff, the number of his souls being computed at a hundred and ten thousand."], [126, "[Let. XI. 102 VERSATILITY OF RUSSIANS. agricultural and out-doors employment is at a stand-still during the winter, he naturally turns to the establishment of a manu factory as a means of employing his peasants and as a source of profit to himself. In some cases the manufactory is at work only during the winter, and the people are employed in the summer in agriculture. Husbandry on an extended scale is often but an unprofitable trade in Russia, from the badness of roads, the paucity and distance of markets, and the conse quent difficult}' in selling produce to advantage. The alternate employment of the same man in the field and in the factory, which would be attempted in most countries with little success, is here rendered practicable and easy by the versatile genius of the Russian peasant. One of his leading national characteristics is a general capability of turn ing his hand to any kind of work which he may be required to undertake. He will plough to-day, weave to-morrow, help to build a house the third day, and the fourth, if his master needs an extra coachman, he will mount the box and drive four horses abreast, as though it were his daily occupation. It is probable that none of these operations, except, perhaps, the last, will be as well perfomiecl as in a counts where the division of labour is more thoroughly understood. They will all, however, be sufficiently well done to serve the turn, a favourite phrase in Russia. The people are a very inge nious race ; but though they will carry many arts to a high degree of excellence, they are apt to stop short of the point of perfection, and their manufactures in no way rival the finish and durability of English goods. Where the rural manufactory is established on a considerable scale, and is constantly at work, the serf operatives are put on the footing of hired labourers, and, instead of having an allot ment of land, they are paid for their work, and left to provide themselves with the necessaries of life. Their master, it is trae, can compel them to work in his manufactory, and that on his own terms ; but these are regulated by custom ; and since the serfs are paid at the same rate with the free work men who may be employed with them, they seldom have reason to complain of injustice in this respect. Not only have the Russian nobles, from the nature of their"], [127, "Let. XL] APPRENTICES. 103 property- and the constitution of the country, become manu facturers, but they carry on the business in every branch, almost entirely to the exclusion of other classes ; since they alone can command without difficult}-, and on advantageous terms, the hands necessary for the purpose. A manufacturer who is not noble, being incapable by law of possessing serfs, while free labour is scarce, must compete at a disadvantage with a rival who can enforce the performance of whatever work he requires, and who has his operatives as it were under military- discipline. Besides the regularly established manu factories, the exercise of various arts on a smaller scale in private houses, either for profit or for home consumption, is very general. One consequence of this sy-stem of things is, that the prices and qualities of various fabrics, such as cloth, linen, paper, glass, china, &c, are as usual subjects of general in terest and of common conversation here, as are farming, plant ing, or draining among country gentlemen in England. Boys are often sent to Petersburg or Moscow, as apprentices, to learn various trades, which they afterwards practise at home for the use and profit of their masters. Thus, in a remote country district, the nobles often have well-taught cabinet makers, coach-makers, smiths, and sometimes even medical practitioners and musicians, ready at command.* I have often been surprised at the excellence and apparent finish of a home-made carriage. But the art of coach-making is in fact one of those most generally exercised for private use, owing, doubtless, to the number of equipages which a Russian habitually requires, and which he thus obtains at a cheap rate. Many ladies employ a number of girls, generally the child ren of household servants, in embroidering and in making all kinds of fancy-work, which they execute most beautifully, and which their mistress sells ; receiving orders for it, as is common in charity-schools in England. In a house where we were visiting some time ago, we were shown a shawl with corners * Occasionally, at the expiration of their apprenticeship, these people, instead of returning to their masters, pay them an obrok agreed upon as an equivalent for their services, and establish themselves in their trades on their own account in towns."], [128, "[Let. XI. 104 DOMESTIC DISCIPLINE. and borders of a most beautiful pattern of flowers in brilliant colours, which had been entirely made at home by a young girl, who brought it to us to exhibit, and who was then em ployed upon another which we saw in progress. Even the w-ool, the colours of which were admirable, had been dyed in the house. The shawl was valued at fifteen hundred roubles, about sixty-two pounds, and it had occupied the girl who made it about a year and a half. In almost every house some female art is carried on, useful or ornamental ; and the women are employed in spinning, weaving, knitting, carpet-making, &o. ; for the raw material in Russia is worth little, and the manufactured article alone is valuable in the market. The ladies of England, however, \" who live at home at ease,\" little know the disagreeable and troublesome duties of inspec tion and correction which thus devolve upon the mistress of a family in Russia, from all the various branches of domestic industry which she is obliged to superintend. The discipline of the estate and of the household is maintained hy means of the lash, from which neither sex is exempt. The frequency and severity of its use depends on the character of the master or mistress, many of whom, like those among whom I have lived, voluntarily limit the application of this punishment to male offenders, and always resort to it with great reluctance. The S3rstem, however, is revolting in itself; and it necessarily opens the door to frequent scenes of gross oppression and cruelty, where, as sometimes happens, the power is vested in hands nearly as rude as those of the serf himself. All owners of serfs are noble, but the law cannot make them all gentle. The following anecdote, which I am assured is true, will illustrate the results of serfdom, while it will remind you of my remarks' in a former letter on the Russian system of mili tary rank, as furnishing the universal rule of precedence. Among the serfs owned by a widow lady was a girl, who had been brought up with unusual indulgence in the household, receiving a superior education, and acquiring manners far be yond those of her class ; to which advantages was added the natural gift of an attractive person. At a proper age she was apprenticed at Petersburg to a French dressmaker or milliner ;"], [129, "Let. XL] ANECDOTE. 105 and, having attained to some skill in the business, she was after a time offered profitable employment. This her mistress per mitted her to accept, on the usual payment of an obrok to herself in lieu of personal service. The girl conducted her self well in her situation, acquiring a knowledge of French, and forming habits of some refinement. Here she attracted the notice of an officer of the rank of colonel, who in due time proved his attachment by offering her marriage. The girl accepted his proposal, and nothing remained but to obtain her freedom from her mistress, the consideration for which \u2014 or in plain words the purchase-money \u2014 the colonel was eager to pay. This ought to have been regulated by the olrok which the girl had paid, calculated at so many years' purchase. The lover, however, was not inclined to dispute the price the lady might demand, but on applying to her, and unfortunately explaining the state of affairs, he received for answer that on no terms whatever would she emancipate her slave. Every effort was used to shake her resolution, which appeared unaccountable ; but argument, entreaty, and money were alike unavailing, and the lady remained inexorable ; giving in the end the clue to her obstinacy, by observing that she would never see her serf take precedence of her, as she would do if married to a colonel, while she was herself but the widow of a major. The match was necessarily broken off, and the girl's prospect of happiness destroyed. To complete her misery, her mistress revoked her leave of absence, and ordered her immediately to return to her native village ; an order which the system of passports and police rendered it impossible to resist or evade.

Rascazava, November 20th, 1837. The winter, according to our English ideas, has now fairly set in, and that with considerable severity. Since the begin ning of this month, with the exception of a thaw once or twice for a day or two, we have had very severe frost, and the ice over the rivers is beginning to be passable even for horses and vehicles. Nevertheless, in Russia it is still considered as autumn ; for, with the exception of a mere occasional sprink ling, we have as yet no snow, which is so far an advantage that the ground is dry and hard under foot, and we are not precluded from taking exercise and enjoying the sunshine. Of all animals it appears to me that the hares just at present have most reason to wish for snow. They have now become perfectly white, and, as the ground is not yet of the same colour with themselves, they may be seen fifty yards off on their forms, and must fall a very easy prey to their enemies, the wolf and the eagle, to say nothing of human pursuers. You perhaps may not be aware that there are game-laws in Russia which prohibit the destruction of game in the spring. The laws, however, on this subject are not, I believe, very rigidly enforced, and the protection therefore which they are intended to afford to the breeding of game is of little effect. I was presented the other day with the skin of a large wolf, which was killed last winter under somewhat singular circum stances in a neighbouring gentleman's house. The house, which is small, is situated in a retired spot on the outskirts of"], [132, "ANECDOTES OF WOLVES. [Let. XIL 108 a large wood, extending up to the very door. There were some puppies about, which probably attracted the wolf, and, emboldened by famine, he followed one of them into tho house \u2014 a step which eventually proved as fatal to himself as to his prey. The house-door opened into a small ante-room, on one side of which was the kitchen, and on the other a room in which the cook's wife happened to be employed at the time. This woman, seeing the animals indistinctly in the dusk, called out to her husband, who was in the kitchen, that a strange dog had followed one of the puppies into the house. The cook looked out of the kitchen-door, and saw, not a dog, but a wolf in the ante-room, devouring the unfortu nate puppy. He called out to the people in the yard, who pulled to the house door, so that the trespasser could not escape ; and then they fetched a gun which they handed in through the window to the cook. The wolf was now alarmed ; and when the man opened the kitchen-door cautiously, and thrust forward the gun to shoot, the beast rushed at him, and, seizing the barrel of the gun in his teeth, almost pulled it out of the cook's hands. He however recovered it, and retreating secured the door. After a few minutes the cook ventured to look forth again, when he saw the wolf crouched against the door of his wife's room opposite. He called to her to make a noise in side to disturb him, upon which the beast got up, and moving aside he instantly received a shot in the head, which the cook fol lowed up by beating out his brains with the butt-end of the gun. Wolves are exceedingly fond of dog's-flesh, and they some times make use of a very cunning stratagem to obtain it. A wolf or two will approach a village in the day-time, upon w-hich all the dogs run out and begin to bark at them. The wolves then pretend to be frightened and retire, upon wdiich the dogs take courage and advance. At length, by alternately stopping and running away, the wolves entice a few of the more adventurous curs to a considerable distance from the village, when they suddenly turn round upon their foremost pursuers and carry them off. Most parts of Russia are sadly infested by these animals, which commit great depredations among the cattle. They are, generally speaking, afraid of human beings, but they occa-"], [133, "Let. XII.] ANECDOTES OF WOLVES. 109 sionally pick up a child in the woods, and instances are by no means wanting of their attacking even grown-up men when the weather is very severe. These misfortunes occasionally happen in the neighbourhood of Petersburg, where the wolves are extremely numerous and very daring. At the country house of a near relation of M \u2014 's, about twelve miles from Petersburg, a man was, a year or two ago, attacked in the gar den by a single wolf and severely wounded, escaping with difficulty with his life. The same place was the scene of another curious wolf-adventure. A disturbance wras heard at night outside the house among the dogs. Several people went out to see what was the matter, but, discovering nothing, though they supposed that a wolf had been there, they came back into the house. Presently, however, they missed one of the servants, a lad of eighteen, who had been one of the first to sally forth. As he did not return, they became alarmed, and, going out again with lanterns to search for him, they- were not long before they found him stretched on the ground, ap parently dead, with a wolf lying by his side. The young man, happily, was only in a swoon, and he soon recovered on being raised up, but the wolf was dead. As soon as the youth was able to give an account of himself, it appeared that, on the first alarm, he had run out of the house with a large stick in his hand, and had been inmiediately attacked by the wolf. This so terrified him that, aiming, in his fright, one instinc tive blow at his enemy, he fell down in the senseless state in which he was found. The single blow of his heavy stick had, by an extraordinary accident, hit the wolf on the head and had killed him. When seven or eight of these animals are collected together in the winter, they are often sufficiently dangerous ; and a single wolf, on meeting a man in a lonely place, will some times commence howling, until his friends around assemble in sufficient numbers to venture on the attack. They will occa sionally even assail travellers on the high road. A friend of mine tells me that once, between Moscow and Petersburg, as he was journeying in an open sledge, it being excessively cold, he was pursued for some miles by a pack of wolves which ran by the side of the sledge, racing \" with their hard gallop \""], [134, "MODES OF DESTROYING WOLVES. [Let. XII. 110 against the frightened horses at full speed, and pressing them so closely, that my friend's valet, who was sitting by his side, stabbed at the brutes with a dagger and wounded some of them as they tried to jump into the sledge. The wolves did not give up the pursuit till they met a long string of sledges, which compelled them to retire. The wolf prefers living in small brushwood covers, near a village, to inhabiting the large forests. These however are the fastnesses of his race ; and the existence of these immense tracts of wood and desert in Russia would, perhaps, defeat any attempt to rid the country entirely- of those ferocious beasts ; though it is difficult to believe that such a pest might not be in some measure put down if exertions were systematically made. Without combination the thing is impossible ; and at present, in most parts of the country, the wolves are rarely molested. Indeed the peasants often have a prejudice against so doing, as they think it only exasperates the animals, and makes them more fierce and dangerous. Owing to this most absurd notion, the wolves in many places are suffered to be come daring by impunity, and they often venture to show themselves in broad daylight, though I have never seen one myself since I have been in the country. There are various ways of destroying wolves. Sometimes this is done by poison, the best being mix vomica, which does not, like arsenic, injure the fur. This is a matter of some con sideration, since a wolf's skin raw is worth from eight to ten shillings. To use the nux vomica, a calf or other dead animal is well impregnated with the poison, and then laid in a retired spot in a wood , where the wolves find the flesh and feast on it. The effect of the poison is very rapid. I have heard of six wolves being destroyed in this maner in one place and in one night. Four were found dead on the spot, and two others were dis covered afterwards at a little distance. The Russians sometimes catch these animals in pitfalls, placing a live lamb or a pig as a bait on the top of a post rising out of the pit. They have also a kind of trap, which is exceedingly simple, but of which I never heard before I came into the country. A small circle is enclosed with a palisade or other fence, made too high for a wolf to leap or"], [135, "Let. XII.] MODES OF DESTROYING WOLVES. 111 climb over. This fence is again surrounded by another of the same kind, leaving a narrow space between the two ; and the outer fence has a door, which opens inwards, so as to fill up when open the space between the two palisades. A lamb or a pig is placed at night in the inner circle, and, being alone, cold, and restless, it does not suffer in silence. The noise it makes attracts the wolf, who pushes open the door of the outer paling, and, finding the inner fence still between him and his prey, prowls round it in hopes of discovering an opening. When, having made the circuit of the place, he again reaches the door, he presses against it, and, thus shutting it to, he im prisons himself ; for the space in which he is being narrow, and the backbone of a wolf being very inflexible, he cannot turn. The door is, of course, so hung as to shut from a very light pressure. Another mode of destroj-ing wolves is by shooting them on a moonlight night in winter. Two or three sportsmen place themselves in a sledge, with active horses, and are driven through the roads and tracts in the woods. In addition to the necessary supply of arms and ammunition they provide them selves with a lively young pig, and with a long rope to trail behind the sledge, with a wisp of straw at the end. As they go along, they pull the ears of the pig from time to time, an insult which it loudly resents in the language of its race. The wolf, hearing the complaints of the pig, and seeing the bundle of straw dancing along over the snow in the moonlight, makes a dash at the latter ; mistaking it for its prey, and thus presenting a fair mark to the gunners in the sledge. Some times in the pursuit of this sport the disappointment is in cui-red of a blank night. Sometimes, on the other hand, too much game is started, and the amusement becomes some what dangerous. If the wolves are too numerous, and the shooters have not time to pick up those they kill, the other wolves w-ill tear the bodies of their dead companions, and, becoming furious, will attack the sledges. A neighbour, whom we often see, met with an adventure of this kind a few years ago. After making his pig squeal for some hours in vain, he at length unexpectedly attracted such a troop of wolves that he was obliged to fly, and trust to his horses' speed to"], [136, "[Let. XII. 112 WOLVES\u2014 BEARS. save his life. He thus escaped, but he was pursued by twelve or fourteen of the ferocious beasts into the middle of this village. The peasants sometimes build a hut in a wood, and throw the carcases of dead horses and other animals near the spot to attract the wolves. They then go before nightfall, and ensconce themselves in the hut, in hopes of getting a shot through one of the loopholes which they leave in the walls of their castle. Unless, however, they build the hut very firmly and securely, they run considerable risk. I have been told a story of a man whose baits drew around him one night an unusual number of wolves. He kept firing away from his lurking-place, killing, wounding, and missing, till he had expended all his ammuni- tion ; but he was still surrounded by enemies, who, becoming infuriated, attacked his fortress, and tried to force an entrance. The garrison was unarmed, but the building was strong and resisted the assault. The wolves attempted to mine and work a way under the walls, but strong stakes, which had been pro- vidently driven in on every side, frustrated then- endea- vours : so at length the besiegers changed their tactics, and converted the assault into a close blockade, hoping to starve out the enemy. Through whichever of his loopholes the poor man looked out, his eyes now encountered those of a wolf seated like a dog on his haunches, and keeping patient watch. When morning came he expected these sentinels to depart ; but no, they were far too inveterate ; some went away, but some still remained, and a close guard was kept all day. Throughout the whole of the next night he was imprisoned ; and it was not till the following day that he was released, either by- the wolves getting tired of waiting, or by his friends at last coming to the rescue. Bears, though they abound in Russia, are not to be met with, like wolves, in every part of the country-. There are indeed numerous districts in which they are never heard of, for they shun cultivation and human dwellings, and they are only to be found in deep and extensive forests. In some of those places where bears abound, there are men who make it their business in the winter to go in pursuit of them alone, and armed only with a strong knife and a spear ;"], [137, "Let. XII.] BEAR-HUNTING. 113 with which implements, by courage and dexterity, they succeed in destroying these dangerous animals. Many years ago an English or Scotch gentleman, who was settled in this country and who was a great sportsman, was shooting small game in the woods in the north of Russia, when he heard the snoring of an animal, and, looking round, after a little while he discovered the head of an enormous bear sleep ing. Having only small shot in his gun, he retreated quietly, breaking the twigs as he went, in order that he might be able to find the spot again. He then made the best of his way to his temporary sporting residence, a small cottage not far off, and proceeded immediately to cast a few leaden balls. As soon as he was thus provided, he with some difficulty induced a peasant to accompany him, with an axe and a dog, to the spot where he had left the bear. The noise he made in approaching roused the animal, but, as it raised its head, the sportsman fired and killed it at a single shot. He called out in triumph to his attendant, who had kept at a respectful distance ; but in the middle of his exultation a second bear came forth from behind the first. Taken as he was by surprise, he immediately fired his second barrel and broke the animal's leg ; when, lo ! from the same prolific lair, a third bear appeared on the scene. The dog now came up and diverted its attention, while our hero took to his heels and ran away ; retreating, nevertheless, only to reload his gun, and, as soon as he had accomplished this necessary operation, gallantly returning to the charge. He now killed with his first barrel the third bear, which was still engaged with the dog, and with his second the wounded animal ; having thus, single-handed, killed three bears in four shots. The peasant, as soon as he saw that they were unde niably dead, ventured forward for the first time, and began most valiantly to hack with his axe at the fallen foe. The large bear was the dam, and, as I am assured, an enor mous beast, the two others being cubs of a year old, quite strong enough to be dangerous. In the government of Novogorod, which abounds in forests and is much infested by these animals, the peasants have, they say, a most singular method of ridding themselves of their disagreeable neighbours. i"], [138, "CUSTOM AMONG BEARS.

They then fasten them on a raft by nailing their feet to it, and set them afloat on the river. The old bears hear their cries and follow the raft down the stream, till at length the young ones die, when their parents become furious and attack what ever they meet ; but they are now at a considerable distance from their original haunts, so that those who were the authors of their misfortune are not those who suffer from their ven geance. I was told this story by a lady, who assured me she had herself seen a raft floating with the young bears dead upon it. The Russians have some singular notions about bears. Among other things they say that a fashionable pair of bears will relieve themselves from the troubles of education by em ploying as a preceptor for their young ones a bear of inferior rank. They afford him protection, and in return he takes charge of the young family w-hile their parents go out to seek food. The bear leader, who is called in Russian Festoon, or Pedagogue, takes his pupils to play in the sun, on the outskirts of the wood, keeping watch himself, and warning them by a cry if any danger approaches. This very sensible custom appears not to have been as yet introduced among the Novogorod bears, since it would otherwise prove a great protection to their progeny against the cruelties practised upon them in that part of the country. Besides bears and wolves, lynxes are tolerably numerous in the forests near Petersburg ; they are, however, I believe, only destructive to hares. There are no deer in most parts of Russia ; but elks may be met with in the winter within fifty miles of Petersburo-. It, however, requires the assistance of one or two hundred peasants, as well as considerable skill and management, to get the elks within shot.

Rascazava, November 25th, 1837. We had a wedding here a few days ago, and we went into the gallery of the church to witness the ceremony, which began at half-past seven in the evening and lasted nearly three-quarters of an hour. The bridegroom was a peasant of rather a superior class and in good circumstances, but still a serf; and the bride was the daughter of a Tamboff tradesman. In a case like this the wife becomes a slave, but she regains her liberty at her husband's death if she survives him.* The church was lighted up, and a small altar was placed in the middle. In front of the altar a carpet is always stretched, on which the couple stand, each holding a lighted taper during the ceremony. They walk up to it side by side, and it is supposed that whichever first sets foot on it will hereafter have the upper hand in the household. Towards the latter part of the ceremony, after a number of prayers and hymns, two crowns of gilt metal were brought to the priest, and he placed them, after making the sign of the cross and pronouncing a short blessing, on the heads of the pair whom he was marrying ; he then joined their hands and led them three times round the altar. A cup filled with wine and water was then brought, of which the bride and bride- groom tasted each three times. After this a homily was read on the mutual duties of husband and wife. At the conclusion the priest desired the newly-married couple to kiss one another, * This rale of law may remind us of a famous poetical dictum respecting a widow's parochial settlement in England: \u2014 \" A woman having a settlement married a man with none.

' \" I 2"], [140, "[Let. XIII. 116 MARRIAGE ETIQUETTE. after which their friends all crowded round them with kisses and congratulations. The crowns, which had been taken off their heads, were now put on again, and they walked out of church preceded by the priest and a deacon bearing the cross, and by a boy carrying a consecrated image to be placed in their bedroom. The bride, who was rather a pretty girl and only seventeen, looked worn out with exhaustion, which was not surprising, as she had come from Tamboff that morning, a journey of six or seven hours over a bad road ; while, according to the custom of her class on the occasion of their marriage, she had tasted no food all dajr. The priest was to join the party at the bridal supper, and I was told that there would be further prayers and ceremonies in the house, and that the happy couple would sit all the evening with the crowns on their heads. This is a mark of distinction, as the poorer peasants do not take the crowns out of the church, having to pay an extra fee to the priest for the permission. At weddings in a higher sphere the crowns are never actually worn, but are held over the heads of the bride and bridegroom during the ceremony by their friends. No marriage can take place in the Greek church during any of the fasts, nor on any Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday. The lawful periods are therefore limited to four daj _ in the week, and that during less than half the year. The cere mony generally takes place in the evening, and the married couple, even in the higher classes, instead of setting off immediately together into retirement for a while, according to our English fashion, are expected to remain for some time with the parents of the lady. Both are required by rigorous etiquette to write beforehand, to announce their approaching union to every relation they possess, and to take the earliest opportunity after their marriage of paying them a visit unin vited. This last is, indeed, an attention which is expected not only by relations, but also by friends, and often even by mere acquaintances. A lady at Moscow told me that she was taken in this manner, as a bride, into about seventy houses, the greater part of which she had never entered since. All general rales have exceptions, but it appears to me, from all that I have heard and can ascertain, that a large proportion"], [141, "Let. XIIL] PARENTAL AUTHORITY. 117 of Russian marriages are mere matters of business and calcula tion, in which family interests are chiefly considered, and the feelings and inclinations of the parties most concerned little regarded, the union being arranged by the respective parents, and the principals submissively acquiescing. In the upper classes this may be a necessary and natural consequence of the restraint which is placed upon the social intercourse of the two sexes, the young men and the young ladies having rarely sufficient opportunity of becoming well acquainted with one another. Another reason for the frequency of mariages de convenance, and one which pervades all classes, may be found in the exaggerated notions of parental authority which prevail in this country, and which appear by no means favourable to the growth and development of true filial affection. Parental tyranny is carried to its highest pitch among the tradesmen and the peasants, and therefore interested mar riages, where the affections are in no way concerned, or rather where they are often outraged, are as common among these classes as among the higher orders. Peasants, however, cannot many without the consent of their master, and he, therefore, has it in his power to a considerable extent to check this evil. If he wishes to do so, when his consent is asked he sends for the two young persons separately, and speaks to each in private, encouraging them to tell him the truth, and endea vouring to ascertain whether the marriage is really their own wish, or whether it has been arranged between their families without their desire. If in this manner the master discovers that they are repugnant to the union, or that their affections are fixed elsewhere, he can easily find a plausible excuse for refusing his consent to the marriage, without betraying to the parents the confidence reposed in him by their children. The following anecdote is said to be true, and it is rather characteristic of the diamond-cut-diamond propensities of the Russian tradesman. A marriage had been arranged between two families in the trading class at Moscow. The father of the young lady was rich, and it was agreed that he should provide her with a hand some trousseau, and that he should pay his son-in-law her fortune"], [142, "[Let. XIII. 118 ANECDOTE. of two hundred thousand roubles (about eight thousand pounds) on the morning of the wedding. The happy day at length arrived, and the trousseau or pridannie was, according to cus tom, packed in handsome chests, which were placed on cars, and paraded through the streets to the bridegroom's house, to display the wealth of the family ; it having already, with the same laudable object, been exhibited in the bride's apartments to all who chose to come, whether to admire or to criticise. Immediately before the wedding the father of the girl pre sented her intended husband with the promised sum as his daughter's fortune ; remarking at the same time to the young man, \" You can't carry such a sum of money as this to church with you, so you had better leave it in my charge at present, and you can take it home with you at night.\" To this proposal the other readily assented ; the wedding was duly solemnised, and was as usual celebrated afterwards by a vast deal of eating and drinking ; and when the happy couple went home at night, the unsuspicious bridegroom was easily persuaded to leave his money in his father-in-law's care till the following morning. The next day he was hardly dressed when he was told that there were some men inquiring for him. He at first refused to see them, saying it was not a moment for business, and he would attend to none that day ; the strangers, how-ever, per sisted, and they were at length admitted. On seeing the bride groom, they immediately told him they were come for the chests. \" What chests?\" was the reply. \" Why, the pridannie, to be sure.\" \" Pooh ! \" said the young man, who supposed that the ornamented chests containing the bride's wardrobe had been hired for the occasion; \" you shall have your boxes as soon as my wife has had time to unpack her things, and put them into their proper places.\" Upon this the lady, who was standing by, looked very foolish, while the men replied that they must have not only the chests, but also their contents. The indignant bridegroom demanded if they meant to carry off his wife's wardrobe. \" Don't talk nonsense about your wife's wardrobe,\" said the intruders, with a provoking laugh ; \" you don't really suppose that all those things belong to her ? the old gentleman only hired them for the occasion, to look"], [143, "Let. XIII.] ANECDOTE. 119 well at the wedding, and we are sent now to fetch them back.\" The bride, on being appealed to, was obliged to admit that all the men had said was true. Accordingly they carried off the handsome furs, silks, jewels, and other valuable ar ticles of a Russian trousseau in that class of life, while the husband betook himself in no good humour to his father-in law, to complain of his deceit, and to get the money which he had left in his charge. \" What money? \" said the old man, in pretended surprise. \" Why,\" said the other, \" the two hundred thousand roubles which you paid me yesterday as your daughter's fortune, and which I left in your care last night.\" \"Ah!\" said the father-in-law, laughing, \"you can't pretend to be serious. The money is mine : I gave it yester day to you to make a show before the company, and you handed it back afterwards, as it was always understood between us that you should.\" It was in vain that the young man stoutly denied the asser tion, and urged the payment of the money, and the fulfilment of the contract. Argument and entreaty proved alike useless.

Tamboff, December 16th, 1837. We have now been settled for nearly three weeks in the town of Tamboff, where we are to spend the winter, and where the families of this district are fast assembling. We have had an uninteri -upted frost since the 16th of November ; but no snow, beyond a mere sprinkling, fell until Sunday last, and even then the quantity was but moderate. It was, however, suffi cient to allow of the use of sledges, a few of which were in motion, to the great joy of their owners, before the ground was thoroughly white. By the following morning the drosch kas and tilegas had entirely disappeared, and no wheeled vehicles were to be seen except a few gentlemen's carriages, which may be used in the streets of a town all winter. Our English ideas of a heavy fall of snow are so closely connected with the notion of stage-coaches buried in drifts, mails due but not arrived, and parties imprisoned in country houses, that it is a little difficult at first to enter into the feelings of the Russian, who looks forward to the same event as affording him means of traffic and communication which he could not otherwise possess. The rise of the Nile is not more interesting or important to the Egyptian than is the establish ment of the trainage or snow-roads to the Russian. If this period be unduly delayed, as sometimes happens, the conse-"], [145, "Let. XIV.] ARBOZES. 121 quences are most injurious to the country, from the difficulty of transporting goods, and from the general interruption to all traffic. The cross-roads, especially in this part of the country, where as I have already told you there is no stone, become perfectly impassable before winter, being first cut into very deep ruts and holes during the wet weather of the autumn, and then in this condition frozen hard. It may therefore be readily sup posed how welcome is the snow which spreads a smooth cover ing over this broken surface, and enables travellers and mer chandise to glide easily and swiftly to their destination, without risk or injury. The internal commerce of Russia is carried on in a manner quite peculiar to the country. There are no bulky stage waggons, but all goods are transported in tilegas* or sledges, according to the season, each vehicle being drawn in general by one horse. These travel in trains, w-hich are called arbozes, and their traffic on the principal roads is very great, even in summer. During the whole journey from Moscow to Tamboff we were seldom half an hour without meeting or passing an arboze, the number of tilegas in each varying from fifteen or twenty up to a hundred. In the winter, however, the trains are much more numerous, t from the increased facility of tra velling and the consequent cheapness of conveyance. The average load for each sledge drawn by one horse is, I am told, about seven hundredweight, the animals being for the most part small and weak. Important as these arbozes are to the internal trade of Russia, they are the source of considerable inconvenience to the winter traveller. The horses are under little control, from the small proportion of drivers, J so that the line which they keep is but irregular, and the sledges, being on smooth wooden runners, * Small light waggons. f I am credibly informed that in the winter fifty thousand sledges come daily into Moscow, loaded with provisions and goods. The charge in the winter, for conveying goods from Tamboff to Moscow, a distance of about three hundred and sixty miles, is a rouble per pood, or one penny per three and a half pounds, nearly. X The law requires that there should be at least one driver to every --hree til-gas or sledges, but it is not rigorously enforced."], [146, "[Let. XIV. 122 CONSCRIPTION. are constantly sliding sideways, so that it is often difficult in passing to avoid- collision. All winter carriages and sledges. of a superior description have narrow irons extending under their runners, and the sharp edges, like those of a skate, preserve them from lateral motion. When the snow is deep, especially if the frost relaxes in severity, the constant passage of the arbozes wears it, as I am informed, into large holes sou: or five feet deep, which render travelling at that time mos fatiguing and laborious, and not entirely free from danger.-' These holes are called ouchabas. The project is now under discussion of a railway from Peters burg to Moscow. The expense must obviously be enormous of making and maintaining the road, and of establishing and keeping up steam-communication on a line of more than five hundred miles through a country devoid of great commercial towns. The Russians, however, value rapidity of locomotion beyond any other people, except perhaps the Americans ; and the country between Petersburg and Moscow certainly presents great facilities to the engineer from its level character. The government therefore may perhaps hereafter be tempted to undertake a work which would enable them, if necessary, to convey troops from one capital to the other in thirty hours. The conscription is now in active progress here, being managed by a board, of which my brother-in-law, in his capacity of marshal of the nobility, is president. He is daily engaged for several hours in the discharge of this duty, and it naturally forms a very frequent subject of conversation, the more so as I have felt much interested in obtaining some acquaintance with the system. For this purpose I attended the other day a sitting of the board to witness their proceed ings. Before, however, I begin to describe them, I must give you a short general explanation of the whole affair. Every class of Russian subjects, except the nobles and the clergy, is required in these days of peace to furnish one recruit annually out of every four hundred males. It is found, how ever, in practice more convenient to make the levy upon each government or province only once in two years, when, conse- * See account, infra, of a winter journey which we afterwards made, and which enabled me to speak on this point from experience."], [147, "Let. XIV.] CONSCRIPTION. 123 quently, one man is called for out of every two hundred.* This year it is the turn of Tamboff and some other governments in this part of the empire to reinforce the armies of Russia. To examine and enlist the conscripts, Boards are appointed which sit from the 1st of November till the 31st of December, in the capital of each province, and in some of the district towns. Tbe Board in the government town is composed of the vice-governor and some other functionaries, a medical man or two, a field-officer, and a subaltern, with a secretary and a number of clerks. In the absence of the vice-governor, which happens to occur here at present, the marshal of the govern ment, whose office I have described in a former letter, presides in his stead. The District Boards are similarly constituted under the chairmanship of the marshal of each district. An aide-de-camp of tho Emperor is always sent to see that the business is properly conducted, and that the different boards discharge their duty. He fixes his head-quarters in the go vernment town, making occasional excursions into the dis tricts, and exercising a general superintendence over the whole proceedings. It is, moreover, the duty of the Imperial aide-de camp, when the business of the conscription is closed, and the full comple ment of men has been enlisted, to inspect the whole body of recruits ; to make a general report of the proceedings to the Emperor ; and to select the finest looking men for service in the Guards. To be made a soldier in Russia implies the being placed at the absolute disposal of the Emperor for military service either by sea or by land. All the sailors on board the men-of-war are soldiers, and they are equipped and exercised as such. The apparent absurdity often remarked of Russian naval captains wearing spurs as a part of their uniform is explained by the fact that during a part of the year they serve on land as field officers. The minimum standard of height for the line is five feet * The recruit, it will be observed, must be between the ages of 20 and 35, sound in body, and at least 5 feet 3 inches in height. The 200 souls out of whom he is selected include the infant and the old man, together with all who are unfit for service. This remark will enable the reader to estimate the heavy pressure of levies such as those of 1854 and 1855."], [148, "124 CONSCRIPTION. [Let. XIV. three inches, and for the Guards five feet six inches. The recruit, when enlisted, must be between the ages of twenty and thirty-five, and he is not entitled to his discharge until he has served for twenty-five years. The wife of a soldier is free, and his children are the property of the crown, which educates the boys as soldiers, and places them in the ranks when old enough to serve. The dread which the Russian peasant has of the conscription is not surprising, when the severity of military service and of military discipline in this country is borne in mind, and when we remember how completely in his case every tie of family or of affection is severed, and every previous hope and pros pect destroyed, when once he is enrolled in the ranks of the army. In fact, to make him a soldier is the most alarming and effectual threat which a Russian master can hold out to the most vicious and refractory of his peasants, and the in fliction of this dreaded punishment is reserved for the worst and the most incorrigible characters. On the estates which belong to the crown, and which form nearly one-half of the landed property of the empire, the lot of furnishing a conscript falls upon each family in turn, according to the number of males of which it consists, the selection being made by the community of peasants themselves. The same rale holds good with regard to the traders, but their numbers are so small in proportion to the peasants, that the ranks of the anny may be considered as almost entirely filled by the latter class. When the families on the Crown estates who are to furnish recruits have been fixed upon by the community, their names are sent in to the Board which I have mentioned ; and it is the duty of the Board, and the most troublesome part of its business, to ascertain that the choice is just and proper. This is done by referring to the registers in which the names and ages of all the male peasants on the estate are inserted, and also by examining the individuals themselves, and hearing all that they have to urge on their own behalf. It not uncommonly happens that in a numerous family the sons are all too young, and that the father alone is capable of serving, while upon him the family depend for their mainten-"], [149, "Let. XIV.] CONSCRIPTION. 125 ance ; and when this occurs, the case is truly pitiable ; while, if the selection have been just,* the Board have often no power to remedy the evil, or to discharge the conscript. When there are two or more brothers of the proper age and height, they either draw lots, or the father names which he pleases as the recruit. Although no one can be compelled to serve until the age of twenty, young men, who are not less than seventeen, and who are of the proper height, may be received, by their own consent, in the room of others. Substitutes are occasionally purchased ; and in this case a legal contract is drawn up beforehand, after entering into which the substitute cannot flinch from his bargain ; but before he is received as a soldier, the money, or whatever part of it remains due, must be paid to him in presence of the Board. If he wishes a portion to be given to any of his family, the persons whom he may name are called in to receive it ; and, finally, a statement of the whole transaction is entered on the minutes. To purchase a substitute costs sometimes not less than a hundred pounds ; but the peasants on the crown estates are occasionally possessed of considerable wealth, and can afford to pay thus highly for exemption from their turn of service. The peasants belonging to the estates of private individuals afford comparatively little trouble to the Board, since it has only to asertain that the recruit is of the proper age and height, and that he is physically qualified for service. It being the privilege of the proprietors to select any of their serfs w-hom they please as conscripts, they naturally endeavour to pick out the worst characters and the most useless men for this purpose. If they have none whom they wish to get rid of for misconduct, they generally make those families draw lots in which there are three or four grown-up sons, and from which therefore one can best be spared. For every recruit who is received, and who is afterwards proved to have been at the time of enlistment physically unfit for service, each member of the Board is liable to a penalty of five hundred roubles, about twenty pounds. Bribery often prevails to a great extent in the business of * I must observe that it is a general instruction to the Board to avoid ruining any family."], [150, "[Let. XIV. 126 CONSCRIPTION. the recruitment ; masters paying to have bad characters, who are unfit for soldiers, received ; and conscripts who are fit for service paying to be rejected. Clerks are sometimes detected in receiving from fifty to a hundred roubles from poor fellows, for protection which they promise, but which they have no power to give ; and these gentlemen are occasionally punished by being made soldiers themselves. The doctor, too, in examin ing the conscripts, not unfrequently, when he inspects their teeth, finds, not a silver spoon, but a gold piece in their mouths, which he is intended to pocket, pronouncing the man in return unfit for service. But the system of bribery is not always confined to these petty offences. The roubles are sometimes paid in thousands ; and the receivers are neither the clerks nor the surgeons to the Board. It is said that the president, if he manages matters well, may clear during the two months of the sitting upwards of two thousand pounds. When this is the case, clerks receive their mites with impunity ; and gold pieces are quietly trans ferred from the mouths of the conscripts to the pockets of the doctor ; instead of being publicly laid on the table of the board, as happens almost daily here. For the president is known to be incorruptible himself, and therefore not inclined to con nive at the delinquencies and peculations of others. Having, as I have already told you, attended a sitting of the board of enlistment, I will endeavour to make you ac quainted with their manner of proceeding, by giving you some description of the scene. The members, as well as the doctors and the secretary, all appear in the civil uniform, which differs little from the mili tary, except in the absence of epaulettes. A standard measure, which cannot be lowered below five feet three inches, is placed in the room, and this is flanked on either side by a tall corporal. The ante-room is crowded with peasants ; and there are a certain number of soldiers and policemen in attendance to keep order. I must premise that when a man is received as a soldier a patch is immediately shaved on his forehead to mark him ; while, if he is rejected, a patch is shaved at the back of his neck, to show that he has been examined, and to prevent his being brought forward a second time. At the conclusion of each day's sitting the recruits who have been enlisted are"], [151, "Let.

To return to the proceedings of the Board : we will suppose the business to begin with the examination of the conscripts furnished from the private estate of a noble. At the president's order one of the corporals in attendance opens the door into the ante-room, and caUs out for the peasants of Ivan Petroitch Pashkoff to be in readiness : the president then reads out A.

These poor men often counterfeit fits and other infirmities, in order to avoid being enlisted ; but if they are discovered, they are liable to severe punishment, and their privilege of claiming a discharge after twenty-five years' service is sometimes taken away from them. When the turn of the crown peasants comes, three brothers perhaps enter together, one of whom is to be selected. They are accompanied by their father and mother, and their wives and children, if they have any ; decency being laid aside, for the three young men, like all the conscripts, present them selves stark naked. The board, after referring to the register, and after hearing all that the men, or that their father and mother have to urge in their behalf, decide that it is justly the turn of this family to furnish a conscript. The three brothers are therefore measured and examined, as in the case which I have already described. The result we will suppose to be that the eldest is tall and healthy, but he has a wife and three or four children ; the second measures but five feet two inches ; and the third brother is a fine growing lad of eighteen. Of the three, therefore, the youngest is under age, and the second is under size. They, therefore, are legally exempted from the conscription, and the eldest brother must be taken away from his wife and family, and must become a soldier, unless the lad of eighteen will voluntarily consent to serve in his stead. A scene now ensues, which is at the same time both pathetic and ludicrous. The elder brother and his wife, the father and mother, and the little children, all throw themselves on the ground and prostrate themselves repeatedly at the feet of the young man, beseeching him to have pity on the family of his brother, and to consent to be enlisted in his place. The poor lad looks with a bewildered air from one to another, not exactly knowing what to do ; on the one hand, having no fancy to be come a soldier, and, on the other hand, wanting resolution posi tively to refuse. He is pressed on every side, for the members of the Board add their exhortations to the entreaties of his family. Some bid him be a good Christian and sacrifice himself for his relatives, while others encourage him with the promise of"], [153, "Let. XIV.] CONSCRIPTION. 129 good treatment in the army if he will enter it. At last, com pletely overpowered, the poor boy musters up courage, crosses himself, and consents to be a soldier. The conscription frequently gives rise to most pitiable scenes, when it happens that married men, or the sons of widows or aged parents, are torn away from families of which they were the chief prop and stay. The recruits often weep bitterly and lament their hard lot when they come before the Board to be examined ; but the moment they are enlisted and their fate decided, they seem to cheer up and recover their spirits, as though they thought it useless to grieve any longer. The Russian peasants are extremely attached to one another in their families, and it rarely happens that there is much difficulty in persuading a young man to devote himself for a relation. On the contrary, they often persist in doing so, for the sake of an elder brother, or an uncle, against the advice of all around them. The other day, a lad under twenty, whose married brother was nominated as a conscript, insisted upon coming here with him, in order, as he said, to see his fate. The man was accepted as a recruit, and the father, coming out, said to his younger son, who was waiting in the street, \" They have taken your brother, Gabriel.\" Gabriel, without answering, rushed into the house, pressed through the crowd in attend ance, and hurried, breathless, into the board-room, fearful of being too late to offer himself as a substitute for his married brother. He appeared, however, in ample time, and, being a fine young man, was readily enlisted in the place of the other. The recruits, after being sworn in, receive at once a great coat and cap, a pair of boots, and some other necessaries ; and they are then quartered in barracks, detachments being occa sionally draughted off to the neighbouring towns. Their beards are immediately removed, the moustaches alone being left ; and in this severe weather it is quite pitiable to see the raw chins of these poor fellows, who have just been shaved for the first time in their lives.* * It will be observed that, in 1837, the average annual drain on the population of Russia, liable to the conscription, was only two and a half per thousand males.

The officer * who is at present charged with this duty at Tamboff, and who has the good fortune to have attained the rank of Colonel at the age of thirty-two, nearly lost his life the other day in a most ignoble manner, namely, from the effects of charcoal vapour in his lodgings. Fatal accidents of this kind are not very uncommon in this country, arising either from ill-constructed stoves or from carelessness in those who have the charge of them. The Russian stove is a sort of oven, with a flue which can be opened or closed at pleasure, and with apertures to admit the warm air into the room. The fire is made entirely with wood, and when it is lighted the flue is opened and the valves are closed. The fuel, as it burns out, is beaten small, and when it is entirely reduced to ashes and the flame and smoke have quite disappeared, the flue is stopped, a handful of salt being first thrown on the remains of the fire. In a couple of hours afterwards the valves may be opened and the hot air allowed * (Note, second edition.)\u2014 The Emperor's aide-de-camp, Colonel Bou tourlin, of the regiment of Chevaliers-Gardes, was an admirable specimen of the Russian officer of the best class.

If, however, the smallest piece of wood remains smouldering after the chimney has been closed, the poisonous vapour from the charcoal penetrates into the rooms. Its presence is easily detected from its smell, especially by those who enter from the open air ; but sometimes the first intima tion which those who are in the apartments have of the exist ence of vapour is given by a sudden and racking headache, which is followed in time by stupor and inability to move. If the vapour has been breathed for some time before it is detected, its effects are often felt for several days afterwards, if not fol lowed by a fatal result. Colonel Boutourlin, the aide-de-camp, had lain down to sleep on a sofa in the afternoon, and his servant awoke him, according to orders, at five o'clock. He got up and at once fell flat on the floor, feeling a strange confusion in his head, and, as he says, hardly knowing where he was. He managed to get on his legs, but he immediately fell again, and, rising up a second time and endeavouring to make his way to the door, his servant fortunately heard him and came to his master's assistance ; not, however, until he had fallen down a third time and cut his face severely against the sharp corner of the door. A doctor was immediately sent for, who at once discovered the cause of the attack in the presence of charcoal vapour. He bathed his patient's head with spirits of wine and eau de Cologne, and as soon as he was sufficiently recovered, he sent him ovit in an open carriage and ordered him to drive about for a considerable time for the sake of air. He continued very unwell for some days from the effect of the vapour, and his face is considerably marked by the bruises he sustained in his fall. As soon as the poisonous vapour is detected, the windows are thrown open, however severe the cold may be, and the rooms are fumigated with burnt vinegar, the flue of the stove being at the same time unclosed. When the 6tove, or peech as it is called, is badly constructed, no care can entirely preserve the rooms from vapour ; since in this case the hot air, which, for some' time after stopping the flue, is always pernicious, will find a way to escape from the stove even before the valves are opened. If it were not for the danger attending them, which indeed k 2"], [156, "132 WARMTH OF HOUSES. [Let.

They only require afire to be kept up for about an hour every day, while the heat which tliej^ produce lasts for twenty-four hours, and can be regulated at pleasure. The rooms are free from draughts, and all parts of the house are equally well warmed. There are no cold entrances or passages, and since the heat is retained all night, there is no cold room to dress in on getting up in the morning. The houses are i__ general thorough]}' warm all winter ; that is to say, from the beginning of October till April or May ; because the stoves are regularly heated, and the double windows exclude entirely the outward air \u2014 a single pane, called a forteshka, being left to open for the purposes of ventilation. It is only in the chilly evenings or rainy days of summer that one ever feels cold in a Russian house. Open grates, in addition to the peech, are daily increasing in fashion, and there are few good houses without them. They are not, however, as yet universal, being regarded as luxuries, though they really make the greatest possible difference in the comfort and wholesomeness of the rooms where they are found. Without fire-places the houses are often damp and chilly in the summer evenings, and there are no means of lighting an impromptu fire; a peech requiring some hours before its good effects are felt. As for the peasants' houses, these are kept nearly all the year round at the temperature of an oven ; and the people are so inured from childhood to an atmosphere strongly impreg nated with charcoal vapour, that in general they feel no incon venience from it, though they are not proof against its fatal effects when in overpowering quantities. Unhappily a man and a boy, on my brother-in-law's estate, have within the last month fallen victims to this subtle poison from their own im prudence. They went, in spite of prohibition and caution, to enjoy the warmth of a stove which had been lighted to dry corn, and, soon falling asleep, they never woke.

They travel on foot ; some coupled to gether with handcuffs, and all with chains on their legs. They are guarded by foot-soldiers with loaded muskets, assisted by two or three mounted Cossacks armed with lances. They niarch about twelve miles a day ; there being at that distance apart, along the road, places of security in which they- are lodged at night. The party, which consists on an average of about twenty prisoners, with eight or ten soldiers, is usually followed by two or three tilegas or sledges to carry bag gage, or to convey those who may fall sick or lame upon the road. The prisoners are always well wrapped up in sheepskin coats and warm caps. The soldiers, in their dirty great-coats, with a loose collar of cloth or fur to protect their ears, look not very unlike ancient London watchmen. The female convicts travel in separate gangs in the same way as the men. I have never seen any prisoners who appeared to be other than ordinary ruffians, but state-criminals of the highest dis tinction are usually compelled to travel in the same weari some and painful manner into Siberia. As to the treatment of the convicts on the journey, it is said that they are better fed than the soldiers who guard them. In trivial matters the police of Russia in the rural districts is chiefly maintained by the proprietors, each keeping order on his own estate. There are, however, magistrates called ispravniks, who arc elected by the nobles from among them selves, and whose authority corresponds in some measure to that of an English justice of the peace. The ispravnik has a number of subordinates, who act as constables under his orders, and ho fulfils in the country the duties which in towns are dis charged by the Master of Police. The authority of masters over their serfs, and their power of punishing and maltreating them, is restrained by law; but laws which defend the weak against the strong are little en forced in Russia. Practically, I believe that the power of the master, especially in remote districts, may be looked upon as nearly uncontrolled. The serf may complain, but his master is the friend of the ispravnik or of some other authority ; or else perhaps a few hundred roubles thrown into the scale of justice"], [158, "PUNISHMENTS \u2014 THE KNOUT. [Let. XV. 134 destroy its balance : so that the unfortunate peasant can seldom obtain redress for his wrongs. When a peasant is convicted by law of an ordinary offence, he is usually flogged; for more serious crimes he is made a soldier, or is sent to Siberia, after receiving the knout.* According to his crime there is a great difference in his fate when he reaches the place of his destination in Siberia. In some cases he is in the com paratively easy position of a colonist, under the surveillance of the police. In other instances he is compelled to labour in the mines, and is treated with the utmost severity as a convict in a penal settlement. The treatment of a noble when convicted of a crime is only different from that of a peasant in that he is exempt from cor poral punishment. He is degraded from his nobility if sen tenced to Siberia, or made a soldier, and he enjoys none of the privileges of his class for the future. A total forfeiture of property accompanies the loss of nobility. It is often boasted that there is no capital punishment in the Russian code, but the professed leniency of the law is not un frequently evaded in practice. The knout is inflicted, excepting on nobles, for all grave offences. In cases of murder or of other heinous crimes, \" without mercy \" is marked on the sen tence, and in this case the punishment is often death, although more than twenty-five blows cannot be inflicted. It is said that there are executioners so terribly skilful, that with three strokes of the knout they can destroy life. Nothing can be said in defence of a system which thus in flicts a death of torture without the sanction of law, by a sub terfuge, and as though by accident. It degrades punishment into cruelty. In the martial law of Russia a similar practice exists, though capital punishment is not, I presume, altogether excluded from the military code even in time of peace. A soldier was lately tried at a garrison in this province for ranning his officer through with a bayonet. The sentence was, that he should ran the gauntlet four times through a thousand men, without going to the hospital. The addition of this last clause implied that * The pronunciation of the /; in this word is very strongly marked ; the on is pronounced as oo in boot."], [159, "Let. XV.] ERRONEOUS PENAL SYSTEM. 135 the soldier was to be flogged to death. In ordinary cases such a punishment is inflicted by successive instalments, the culprit being sent in the interims to the hospital, and a surgeon being at each time in attendance to see that his life is not endan gered. The compelling a man to ran the gauntlet is no unusual punishment in the Russian army. The troops form a lane, up which the criminal passes, with a soldier before and another behind him to regulate his march. Each man in the lino is armed with a stick, with which he is obliged to give the prisoner a blow as he passes, under the penalty of being severely punished himself if he evades doing so. When a prisoner who is not to go to the hospital can no longer walk he is placed on a cart, and the punishment is continued whether he lives or dies, for it is said that in the latter case the full tale of blows awarded by the sentence is completed on the senseless corpse. A most erroneous part of the Russian penal system appears to be that of sentencing civil offenders of all kinds to serve as soldiers. If a steward cheats his employer, or a servant robs his master, the culprit is made a soldier. If a coachman drives over a person in the street, he is seized by the police and made a soldier ; * and his master himself, if he embezzles money, or takes a bribe and is detected, is equally made a soldier. It is the great object of the Russian government to encou rage and uphold the anny ; and yet its ranks are daily swelled with thieves, vagabonds, and drunkards. The private soldiers can hardly feel much respect for an uniform thus tarnished ; while their respect for their officers must be diminished at seeing the General who commanded them yesterday, sentenced, for some breach of duty or some act of disobedience to his superior, to bear a musket in the ranks to-day. Occurrences of this sort, though naturally not very common, yet are by no means unknown.

From a regard to his friend, instead of executing the Ukase, he put it in his pocket, and allowed a month to pass without taking the steps which his duty re quired. For this offence he was tried and found guilty, and the following sentence was pronounced and executed. He was brought in full uniform, with his stars and other decora tions, into a room where the ordinary business of receiving oonscripts was going on, as described in my last letter. The General was stripped ; he was put, according to the usual form, under the standard ; his height was noted down ; his forehead was ordered to be shaved, and he was taken out of the room a common soldier, and sent to Siberia. Those who are thus condemned to serve as soldiers are not altogether placed on the same footing as the ordinary recraits. They are not entitled to their discharge at the end of twenty five years, and they are, if their offences have been serious, sent into a penal corps. Still they are soldiers, and to be made a soldier has thus become connected with the idea of disgrace and punishment ; by which the moral tone and esprit de corps of the army must be greatly lowered. The great national disgrace of the Russian character is undoubtedly the universal corruption which pervades every department in the state. This charge can hardly be denied ; for every Russian will tell you, \" There is nothing to be done in our country without a bribe.\" The only difference appears to be in the amount, which is proportioned to the rank of the receiver. At the foot of the scale three or four roubles may suffice, while as many thousands may be requisite for the im portant personage at the head. No one will be unjust enough to suppose that honest men are not to be found here as well as in other countries, and I should be sorry so far to calumniate Russia as even to sug gest that they were rare. Still, from all that I have l^ard in various quarters, I cannot doubt of the lamentable prevalence of gross corruption. The fact of a person in a high and digni fied position receiving a bribe to secure his good offices does not cause a serious scandal here, or seem to be regarded with that degree of contempt and indignation which would mark a"], [161, "Let. XV.] A LUCRATIVE POST. 137 nice sense of national honour and a high standard of public opinion. As an instance, the salary of a governor of a province is twelve thousand roubles a-year, or about five hundred pounds ; a sum which is quite insufficient to cover the expenses of his establishment. Yet I am told that a late governor of Saratoff, on the Volga, one of the richest provinces in Russia, retired, after holding tho office for six years only, with a capital, noto riously realized during that period, of three millions of roubles, about a hundred and twenty thousand pounds. I inquired how this was possible, and the following is, in sub stance, the explanation which I received. This Governor usually abstained from any direct acts of private injustice or oppression ; but for value received he con sented to shut his eyes and not to interfere with the misdoings of his inferiors. He, in fact, sold his protection wholesale to his subordinates, leaving them to dispose of their good offices by retail for their own profit according to the demand. In each of the twelve districts of every government is an ispravnik, an officer whom I have already mentioned as a rural magistrate or master of police. Fetch ispravnik paid his Excel lency the Governor five thousand roubles a-year, a douceur which obliterated any little peccadilloes of the officer, or any mistakes into which he might fall in administering justice. The Bashkirs, and other wild tribes who dwell in the Steppes beyond the Volga, wished to remain in undisturbed possession of lands claimed by the Crown. The Governor threatened them with forcible ejectment, but his annual re venue was increased by thirty or forty thousand roubles, and the Bashkirs were left in repose. The province, again, abounded in heretics, of a sect regarded with much jealousy by' government, and much persecuted for their political rather than for their religious opinions. These- sectarians longed for peace and quiet, and the price of the Governor's toleration was from one to two hundred thou sand roubles a-year.

Tamboff, December 27th, 1837. I told you in a former letter that the upper classes of Russia were usually by no means strict in their observance of the fasts and ceremonies of the Church ; but there are some striking exceptions, more especially among the ladies. Of these we have rather a remarkable example in the society of Tamboff. We have a lady here who, in her attention to all such points, is most rigid and undeviating, and who, more over, by her evidently sincere belief in the miraculous virtues of images and reliques, reminds me of some characters depicted in medi\u00e6val history, the like of whom I scarcely expected to meet with in real life in this nineteenth century. This lady, having a daughter unwell a few years ago, dreamed that a monk came to her and told her that if she took her child to the shrine of a certain saint at Veronish, a town at no very great distance from Tamboff, she would be cured. Madame B., for so we will call her, followed the advice of her nocturnal counsellor ; and the young lady, after the pilgrimage to Veronish, in due time recovered her health. Her mother attributed her restoration entirely to the miraculous interference of the saint, and, out of grati tude for the cure, she made a vow to live for the rest of her days as a nun ; that is to say, to eat only fish, vegetables, and the like, abstaining entirely from meat. She has a picture of the saint as the image in her private room, and she declares that, by putting a piece of paper, in which this image had been wrapped, under her pillow at night, she was lately cured of a violent headache. She is, indeed, a firm believer in charms of all kinds. Lately I saw her produce, out of a pile"], [164, "ARCHBISHOP OF TAMBOFF.\" [Let. XVI. 140 of recipes for the cure of colds, coughs, and sore throats, a slip of paper which she said contained an excellent remedy for the bite of a mad dog ; adding that, extraordinary as we might think it, she herself had witnessed its good effects. In one corner were written three short words, which she said must be copied on little bits of paper, and the latter then rolled up into the form of pdls, three of which were to be swallowed daily for the space of nine days. A few days ago Madame B. gave a grand dinner to the Arch bishop on the consecration of a new altar in one of the churches of Tamboff. She was kind enough to invite us to the entertain ment, and you will perhaps be amused by some description of it. As we were then in the middle of the six weeks' fast of the Greek Church preceding Christmas, the dinner could not be otherwise than exclusively maigre in the presence of the Arch bishop ; and the invitation to us was accompanied by a few words of explanation on this point. The dinner itself seemed intended to convince us that cooks, if really artistes, are inde pendent of butchers. No sign of ascetioism appeared among the guests, or in the fare itself, which was as suitable for mor tifying the appetite as is a fish dinner at Greenwich \u2014 the only thing at all resembling it in England. We went to Madame B.'s house at about half-past two, and we found the Archbishop there, and many guests already assembled. Most persons on entering the room went up to his Eminence and kissed his hand, receiving his blessing. The Archbishop of Tamboff is a strong, harsh- featured man of about forty, with no great expression of dignity in his countenance, though it is grave and calm. He was dressed in a long robe, or caftan, of dark-brown flowered satin, with largo sleeves, dis playing an under-dress of pale green silk. He was decorated with the red ribbon, cross, and star of St. Anne, and on his breast hung a miniature image, set in diamonds. In his hand he held a rosary of white beads ; and on his head he wore the usual monk's cap of black velvet, made like a hat without a rim, and w-ith a hood or veil hanging down behind. The whole party amounted to twenty-nine, among whom were several priests, and one monk, attendants on the Prelate. When dinner was announced, the Archbishop led the procession into"], [165, "Let. XVI.] RUSSIAN MODE OF FASTING. 141 the dining-room, walking alone at the head of the guests. The choristers of his convent were placed in a gallery, and they sung a grace before we sat down, and several hymns at inter vals during dinner. Unfortunately, they were placed rather nearer to us than they should have been, and their voices, adapted to a church, were too loud for the room. The dinner, which consisted entirely of fish and vegetables under various forais, was most recherche, and was served in the best pos sible style ; but the number of dishes, between the sterlet soup which headed the banquet, and the ice which ushered in the dessert, was so great, that, although each was handed round in duplicate, we were nearly three hours at table. The variety of good things really appeared interminable. Wine of every kind was handed round in turn, and the object seemed to be that of showing how luxuriously people might fare without the use of meat, while the whole thing amounted to a practical satire on the Russian system of fasting. Towards the conclusion of dinner, while the servants were handing round champagne, a deacon, who was seated near the bottom of the table, rose from his seat, and placed himself before the image in the corner of the room. I did not under stand what he was about, but I supposed that he was appointed to say grace, and that he had rather mistaken his time, as the dinner was not quite concluded. However, he kept looking over his shoulder, his back being tinned to the table, and he evidently awaited a signal. At last he apparently received it, for he suddenly opened his mouth, and thundered forth a chant in a deep bass voice, while in an instant the whole party, excepting the Archbishop, rose to their feet, and I was utterly at a loss to- comprehend the scene. On the one side I saw the deacon singing with the voice of a Stentor, and bowing and crossing himself before the image ; and I might have supposed myself in a church. If I looked the other way, there were the guests standing up on both sides of the table, each with a bumper of champagne in his right hand, and we seemed to be a convivial party doing honour to a popular toast. This incongruous spectacle lasted for two or three minutes, when the chant ceased, and we all resumed our seats. I then asked my neighbour, who was"], [166, "DINNER VISITS. [Let. XVI. 142 somewhat amused at my surprise, what all this meant, and he told me we had only been drinking with the usual forms the health of the prelate at the top of the table. I am very glad to have had an opportunity of witnessing an entertainment of this kind, as it is nQt an every-day occur rence ; and much of it was both new to me and strongly cha racteristic of Russian manners and customs. In general, how ever, it must be owned that a formal dinner at three o'clock, the fashionable hour at Tamboff, is not a thing to be de sired. It breaks up the day, and the whole affair is gene rally over, and the house clear of guests, by five, just as the ice might otherwise have begun to thaw, and the society might have become a little animated. At dinner the two sexes are carefully separated, the ladies sitting on one side of the table and the gentlemen on the other, as though they were afraid of one another ; in consequence of which arrangement, the conversation at table is rather apt to be dull and languid. Sometimes the entertainer, instead of sitting down with his guests, spends most of his time during dinner in walking about from one to another, and in seeing that the servants are alert in attending- to their' duties. This is, however, an anti quated notion of hospitality, and the practice is obsolete in good Russian society. It may almost seem ungrateful on my part thus to criticise the habits of a place where we have received so much hospitality, and have made so many agreeable acquaintances and friends.

His wife has visited England, and before her marriage she lived chiefly in the society of Petersburg, as one of the maids of honour of the Empress. They both speak English nearly as well as we speak it ourselves ; and with their knowledge of the world, and thorough acquaintance with the peculiarities and institutions of their own country, we could not be in better hands for informa tion or entertainment. Of their kindness and hospitality our prolonged visit is a standing proof. Not unfrequently an agreeable neighbour or two come un invited to dinner or to tea, and we pass our pleasantest evenings in the easy conversation of this intimate society. A few evenings ago a small party of this kind had assembled, and the subject of presentiments came under discussion. Every one had his story, drawn from his own experience or that of his friends, of a presentiment fulfilled in some unlooked-for manner. At last my sister-in-law told us the following anec dote, many of the particulars of which had occurred within her own knowledge, while the rest are well authenticated. The story may almost rival the tale of Polycrates, tyrant of Samos, of famous memory. She said that in former days she had been intimate at Peters burg with a lady who married a General R \u2014 .* Years passed, and the General was appointed to a command at Warsaw, their family now consisting of seven children, of whom the eldest was a beautiful girl of eighteen. After the General and his family had been for some time established at Warsaw, Madame R \u2014 wrote to my sister-in-law giving her an account of a visit which the Emperor Nicholas and the Empress had paid to the capital of Poland, adding that a remarkable tide of fortune had on this occasion flowed in upon themselves. In the space of little more than a week her husband had been appointed Aide-de-Camp General to the Emperor ; she herself had received the Cockade, a decoration conferring on a lady precedence at Court ; her daughter had been named maid of honour to the Empress ; and her eldest son had received a * (Note to second edition.) \u2014 This anecdote was not given in the former edition, but so many years have now passed that no pain can be caused by its publication."], [168, "[Let.

Madame E \u2014 concluded her letter by saying, \" I assure you so much good fortune frightens me, and I cannot enjoy it from a dread that some reverse must come.\" For this apprehension there seemed no grounds when her letter arrived ; but about six months afterwards Madame R \u2014 was sitting at home at Warsaw working, with her daughter by her side, when the latter said, \" Mamma, I've such a headache that I must go aud lie down.\" Her mother's bed-room opened, as is usual, into the sitting-room, and the girl went into it and lay down, leaving the door open. Madame R \u2014 continued work ing, and after a time, chancing to look up, she saw her daughter had come back and was sitting again by her. She noticed, however, that she had changed her dress, and she said, \" Sophie, I thought you meant to lie down and keep your head quiet.\" To this remark there was no answer, and the girl seemed not to hear. She then called her sharply by name to rouse her ; upon which Sophie answered out of the next room, and immediately appeared at the door. She looked towards her mother, and said, in a terrified voice, \"Good Heavens! there I am ! \" bursting into tears, and saying she had not long to live. The figure in the chair then vanished. Her mother did not confess that the figure had been visible to herself, but she told her daughter that she must have seen herself suddenly in the glass. However, next day poor Sophie was seized with scarlet fever, and she died in a fortnight. A few months after this sad event the Polish Revolution broke out, and General R \u2014 , being captured by the Poles, was imprisoned at Warsaw for three months, during which time he endured the most cruel treatment. His wife escaped with her children to Vienna, where for some time she was absolutely dependent on charity. A sister, married to a Russian Colonel of Artillery, accompanied her to Vienna, leaving of necessity her husband at his post. In an engagement with the Poles, the Colonel's men mutinied and refused to fire at a critical moment. In despair he blew his own brains out with a pistol on the spot.

We have frequently had by Reaumur's thermometer * twenty-four or twenty-five, and sometimes even thirty, degrees of frost. And the intensity of this cold has been often increased by wind ; for twenty degrees of frost on a still day are more supportable than ten with a wind. The difficulty in going out is to preserve the face, especially the nose and forehead, from being frost-bitten or rather frozen. When this misfortune occurs no pain is felt, but the part affected becomes hard and white. j\" It is easily cured at first by nibbing the skin with snow till the circulation is re stored : but if it is neglected the effects of the frost are very pain ful, and sometimes a wound ensues which may end in mortifica tion. If the skiD be blistered the application of goose-oil is considered an excellent remedy. Four years ago upwards of five hundred persons were frozen to death in the course of the winter in this Government, which, it must be remembered, con sists chiefly of open steppes, where the effects of a high wind are most formidable. The snow is blown into enormous drifts, burying man and horse, while it entirely obliterates the tracks ; and the traveller who loses his way must almost inevitably perish on these unsheltered plains. From the scarcity of wood on the steppes the inhabitants have little fuel, except straw and * One degree of Reaumur's scale equals two and a quarter of Fahren heit's, nearly. t A stranger will often stop a person in the street to tell him that his nose or his cheek is frozen."], [171, "Let.

In the severe winter which I have mentioned, viz. that of 1833-4, a complete panic was excited. A gloomy foreboding of evil seized men's imaginations, and not only many among the common people, but even some of a higher class, were terrified by a prophecy which announced that on the first day of the new year then ensuing there would be no less than one hundred and ninety degrees of frost, when man and beast must necessarily perish. The English papers have, no doubt, made you acquainted with a great calamity which has lately occurred at Petersburg, in the destruction of the magnificent Winter Palace by fire, on the night of the 29th of December. Various reports have been spread as to the cause of this misfortune. It has been hinted that it was not altogether accidental, and that the authors of the calamity are conspirators against the govern ment. All such rumours, however, appear to be utterly groundless, and it seems that the fire undoubtedly originated in want of precaution on the part of those wbo were charged with the care of the stoves ; some of which were out of order, so as to ignite the adjoining wood-work. This it is supposed had been smouldering for a day or two ; and it is even said that a smell of burning had been noticed, and yet that no pre cautions were taken. Be this as it may, the fire broke out on the night which I have mentioned, while the Emperor and Empress with their grown-up children were at the theatre where Taglioni was dancing. A messenger was immediately sent to the Emperor, who came away without alarming the Empress, under the pretence that a courier had arrived with despatches for his own hand. He found that the young Grand Dukes had been already taken out of the Palace and placed in a caniage to await his directions ; and that the valuable Crown jewels had also been removed to a place of security. His Majesty therefore proceeded at once to his own private apartments in the burning palace, and, with the assistance of his valet-de-chambre, packed up and secured his private papers. Having completed this im portant task, he sent to inform the Empress of the disaster. l 2"], [172, "ANECDOTE OF THE EMPEROR. [Let.

She then went to the house of Count Nesselrode, on the opposite side of the Imperial Place or Square, and established herself at one of the windows, where she remained for two hours watching the progress of the fire, which gained ground rapidly. Owing to the intense frost (twenty-six or twenty-seven degrees of Reaumur), the engines were useless for want of water. The flames continued to rage all night, and the loss is estimated at more than a million of pounds sterling. A considerable part of the magnificent furniture was saved, together with most of the pictures and valuable curiosi ties. More might have been rescued from the fire, but, as it spread, the Emperor forbade all further exertions, on account of the danger. The soldiers, however, who were engaged in removing the furniture, were so eager, that it was difficult to restrain them, and even the Emperer himself, as it is said, had some trouble in enforcing obedience when he commanded them to desist. The following anecdote* is told of his Majesty's presence of mind on the occasion. Some soldiers were busily employed in taking down a magnificent min-or which stood opposite to the door, when the Emperor, who was in the adjoining room, saw that the ceiling was cracking over the heads of the men. He called to them to desist and come away- instantly, but they were so eagerly engaged in their work that they did not immediately obey, and the Emperor, perceiving that no time was to be lost, threw his opera-glass, with all his force, at the mirror, and broke it in the middle. The soldiers, perceiving it to be spoiled, though they scarcely knew how, gave themselves no further trouble about it, and left the room, and the ceiling fell in a few minutes after wards. I, myself, think his Majesty is quite as likely to have aimed at the men's heads as at the minor, by way of effectualh' exciting their attention. Whether I am right in my conjecture, * I find that this anecdote is given by Lord Londonderry in his account of his visit to Petersburg and Moscow; I have, however, not thought it worth while to expunge it from my letter, since I heard it at the time, and on authority which I could not doubt."], [173, "Let. XVII.] WASHERWOMEN IN WINTER. 149 or whether the more courtly version of the story is trae, the Emperor undoubtedly appears to have saved the lives of the party by the expedient which he adopted. The palace was inhabited by fifteen or sixteen hundred souls, but I believe no lives were lost in the fire excepting those of four or five sol diers, who perished in the White Hall, from the roof falling in upon them. Of those who are exposed to the severity of a Russian winter, the washerwomen always appear to me the most deserving of pity. They may be seen daily in numbers washing clothes, not withstanding the bitter cold, at holes cut in the ice of the river, rinsing the linen in the water, and then laying it on the ice and striking it with a wooden beetle instead of wringing it. The linen is taken down to the river and convey-ed home again on small sledges, which the women draw after them. These women, and indeed the female peasants in general, are dressed in the winter almost like the men, in sheepskin coats and high boots reaching to the knee, with their heads wrapped up in handkerchiefs. The hands of the washerwomen are necessarily undefended, and it surprises me that they can pre serve the use of them, when they are wet and then exposed to the intense frost. The sentinels at this season, in addition to their great-coats, are provided w-ith large sheepskin pelisses or wrappers, which cover them completely-. They have also wami gloves and goloshes lined with fur; and they wear under the shako cloth skull-caps, protecting the ears and the back of the head and neck. Since Christmas we have had a rapid succession of as semblies, balls, and parties of various kinds ; and coachmen and horses have been forced to remain out of doors in the cold, while their masters and mistresses w-ere amusing themselves in warm rooms within. The horses, however, are secured from harm by their own hardy nature and by their long rough coats ; while the drivers are so well wrapped up in furs and sheepskins, as almost to bid defiance to the frost. Nevertheless in Petersburg and Moscow * all places of public amusement * In these capitals during the winter large fires are lighted at night in the public places near the theatres and palaces, with screens from the wind, for the benefit of the coachmen and servants waiting with carriages."], [174, "150 MORNING CALLS. [Let. XVII. are closed, from humanity to man and beast, when the cold reaches an extreme point ; and Court festivities are, under the same circumstances, postponed. It is not the fashion at Tamboff for entertainers to issue cards of invitation, or to engage their guests long beforehand. Instead of this, a lady who intends to give a ball or party usually goes round the town making calls, and inviting the ladies in person for the next day or the next but one ; leaving a card or message for those whom she does not find at home. Her husband follows her in her circuit at a short interval to invite the gentlemen, who would not be pleased were this ceremony omitted. These calls sometimes begin as early as nine o'clock in the morning, and we often find cards on the breakfast-table which have been left before we were dressed. About Christmas and the New Year the people appear to spend most of their time in hurrying from house to house, and paying a flying visit or leaving a card ; as custom requires that on one, if not both, of these occasions they should take the trouble of calling on all their acquaintances with congratula tions. On Christmas-day my brother-in-law was too unwell to admit visitors, and eighty-two cards were left at his house in the course of the morning. On New Year's day he devoted himself to the task of politeness in return ; and he tells me that before he came home he had called at fifty houses. At Odessa, instead of making these calls in person, they put advertisements in the newspaper to the effect that Mr. A. pays his respects to Messrs. B., O, D., and the rest of the alphabet. The ladies are in general very well dressed xolien they appear in public* Indeed their toilettes must be the source of no inconsiderable expense, since it seems to be held necessary that a lady should not appear in the same dress at two balls in the course of the winter. In a society such as that of Tamboff, no one can hope to infringe this rule without instant detec tion on the part of her fair friends. Ladies of moderate fortune in Russia possess, generally speaking, more jewels than Eng- * Some of them do not equally deserve to be commended for personal neatness when unadorned for society."], [175, "Let. XVIL] EVENING PARTIES. 151 lisb women in similar circumstances. A valuable shawl, and diamonds to a certain amount, are considered indispensable requisites in the list of marriage presents from every husband to his bride.* At evening parties, trays loaded with bonbons, apples, grapes, and sweetmeats, are handed round in great abundance, and ices are also served in profusion : but ladies ornamented with diamonds do not appear to advantage in society when munching unpceled apples ; nor does it quite accord with tho dignity of generals, decorated with stars, to stuff their pockets with bonbons, and carry them away ; both of which practices prevail. No plates accompany these refreshments, and, there fore, the floor of the room is quickly strewed with the papers in which the bonbons have been wrapped ; while apple-cores and grape-skins are thrown without compunction under the chairs. The sweetmeats are brought in numerous large saucers, but with only two or three spoons on the tray ; a guest being expected, after using a spoon, to restore it to the saucer for the benefit of his neighbour. In some houses, instead of laying cloths for supper, the plates are set down on the naked card tables, scrawled all over with chalk ; from the Russian fashion, which I have mentioned, of marking in this manner the state of the game. The suppers are very elaborate and good, but they seldom make their appearance till two o'clock in the morning, though we dine at three in the afternoon. The fact is that Russians have a habit of quitting the house where they are entertained the moment they rise from table, whether it be late or early ; and the late supper is arranged with the hospi table intention of detaining the guests as long as possible. I observe that in this society the young married women seem to possess greater attractions than the maidens. Indeed, Rus sian notions impose upon the latter so much restraint, that it. sometimes appears difficult to keep up a conversation with them, as they can hardly be induced to take their fair share ; and, I believe, the unmarried men are absolutely afraid of them. Perhaps if a gentleman were to pay a young lady the atten tions which, according to our ideas, ordinary politeness would * Indian shawls and diamond ornaments were to be purchased in the shops at Tamboff.

The young ladies usually stand huddled to gether in the rooms in knots, and they are seated at supper like a set of children, at a separate table ; without a single partner to enliven them. The young men naturally look equally didl in their state of isolation. A pleasant and animated conversation is certainly more rare and more difficult to maintain in Russia than it is in England. The Censorship, as I have already remarked, places a great restraint upon literature ; and there are few subjects to talk about of general interest, since political topics are entirely banished. No one likes, in general society, to hazard the most indifferent remark on any act of the Government, which is said, I believe with much truth, to have active spies among every class and in every quarter. Besides these unknown spies, there are, in eveiy town, officers of gendarmes, or, as they are often called, of the secret police ; part of whose duty avowedly is to report to St. Petersburg all that is passing around them, even, as I am told, to the merest gossip. Count Benkendorf is at the head of this department ; and all persons unite in declaring that nothing could render so odious a system tolerable but the manner in which it is organised by its present Chief, who has succeeded in acquiring much popularity notwithstanding the unpleasant nature of his office. So strongly is the habit of prudent reserve imprinted on the minds of Russians that their natural curiosity and desire for information often seems to be stifled, and it is difficult to ex cite their interest in any public event. On the evening after the ai-rival of the post which brought intelligence of the Winter Palace having been burned, we happened to be at a small party, consisting of less than a dozen people; one of whom had received a letter from a friend at Petersburg, giving him an account of what had occurred. As no public papers had ar rived that day, it would have been natural for this gentleman to impart his correspondent's information, and to tell us all he knew about an event of so much general interest. Instead of this however, small and private as the society was, it was merely mentioned in the room that a report had arrived of a serious fire at the palace, and no one ventured to enter at all"], [177, "Let. XVIL] OCCURRENCE AT A MASQUERADE. 153 upon the subject.* The fact, I suppose, was, that silence was the safe course, and that no one liked to be the first to bruit about the news of such a disaster. When the newspapers an-ived, they merely stated in a short paragraph that the palace had unfortunately been destroyed by fire. They entered into no details, and they only made their account of the misfortune the vehicle for a little flattery of the Emperor and the Imperial family. I will conclude my letter with an account which the Em peror's aide-de-camp, Colonel Boutourlin, lately gave us of a very singular occurrence which took place three years ago at Petersburg. Strange as the story appears, I am assured that it is undeniably true. About the time of Christmas, masquerades are much in vogue in Russia, and even when an ordinaiy ball is given at this season, it is not unusual to place candles in the windows of the house as a well-understood signal that masks may enter with out special invitation. At the period to which this story refers, namely the Christ mas of 1834, a ball was given at a house at Petersburg (the name of the owner was mentioned, but I have forgotten it), and the ordinary signal was displayed for the admission of masks. Several masks arrived in the course of the evening, staid but a short time, as is usual, and departed. At length a party entered dressed as Chinese, and bearing on a palanquin a person whom they called their chief; saying that it was his fete-day. They set him down very respectfully in the middle of the room, and commenced dancing what they called their national dance around him. When this was con cluded, they separated and mingled with the general com pany, speaking French fluently (the universal language at a Russian masquerade), and making themselves extremely agreeable. After a while they began gradually to disappear unnoticed, slipping out of the room one or two at a time. At last they were all gone, but their chief still remained * I have since been informed that the Emperor caused it to be under stood at Petersburg that the subject of the fire was not agreeable to him, and that the less it was discussed in society, the better he should be pleased."], [178, "[Let. XVII. 154 OCCURRENCE AT A MASQUERADE. sitting motionless in dignified silence in his palanquin in the middle of the room. The ball began to thin, and the attention of those who remained was wholly drawn to the silent figure of the Chinese mask. The master of the house at length went up to him, and told him that his companions were all gone ; politely begging him at the same time to take off his mask, that he and his guests might know to whom they were indebted for all the pleasure which the exhibition had afforded them. The Chinaman, however, gave no reply by word or sign, and a feeling of un easy curiosity gradually drew around him the guests who remained in the ball-room. He still took no notice of all that was passing around him, and the master of the house at length, with his own hand, took off the mask, and discovered to the horrified by-standers the face of a corpse. The police were immediately sent for, and on a surgical examination of the body it appeared to be that \"of a man who had been strangled a few hours before. Nothing could be discovered either at the time or afterwards which could lead to the identifying of the dead man, or to the discovery of the actors in this extraordinary scene, and no clue has ever been obtained. It was found on inquiry, that they arrived at the house where they deposited the dead body in a handsome equipage with masked servants. If this story be true, and Colonel Boutourlin spoke of it as a well-known and undoubted fact, an assurance which I have since heard confirmed on good authority, the method by which the murderers disposed of the remains of their victim is one of the most unaccountable which was ever planned or executed by human ingenuity. It is surmised to have been, in some way or other, the denouement of a gambling transaction. It does not perhaps argue much acuteness in the detective powers of the police that the body should never have been identified ; but the proper use of the proper amount of roubles may very possibly have suppressed inconvenient discoveries."], [179, "Let.

Tamboff, February 2nd, 1838. The delights of sledging have always been cried up to me in the most exalted terms since I have been in this country-. No doubt it is an excellent mode of traveUing, when the snow is in a good state, and when the cold is not too intense ; since the pace is usually very rapid, and the risk of dangerous roads is avoided. I am, however, unable to appreciate the luxury, in which a Russian finds so much enjoyment, of driv ing about for amusement in the little sledges which are used in ton -is. Were there no other objection to this indolent pleasure, the coachman himself is a great hindrance to one's enjoy ment, as he is too near to be agreeable, and his person entirely obstructs the view. Moreover the horse, and especialty the outrigger, if there are two, sends up a perpetual shower of snow from his hoofs, which often compels one to close one's eyes. Still it must be owned that one of these sledges, with a well-dressed coachman to drive it, and a fine horse in the shafts, is a very pretty little equipage. The sledge is made of rosewood, mahogany, or some other handsome wood, well varnished, and neatly relieved by a little gilding ; the apron being of cloth lined and edged with bearskin. The coachman wears a cloth caftan, edged with fur, and fastened round his waist by a gay-coloured sash. On his head he has a warm cap of crimson or blue velvet, with a fur band ; while an ample and handsome beard is an essential orna ment to his face. Sledges for family parties are made capa cious enough to hold ten or a dozen people, being fitted like carriages with a pole, and drawn by four or even six horses. A close carriage, placed on runners instead of wheels, is"], [180, "[Let. XVIII. 156 CHEAPNESS OF TRAVELLING. called a vasok. It is a very convenient vehicle for town use, and it is preferred by many people for winter travelling on account of its warmth. A vasok adapted for this purpose has no springs ; but it is not considered so safe for a journey when the roads are bad, and the snow is worn into holes, as the ordinary winter vehicle called a kibitka. Kibitkas are of various kinds, according to the taste or means of the owner ; the best sort being a species of caleche, warmly fitted up, and placed on runners. The kibitka is closed with leather cur tains instead of glass ; and on each side near the ground pro jects a strong wooden elbow, so that the vehicle cannot easily be upset; the elbow being a necessary appendage for this purpose to all sledges intended for country use. The kibitka has shafts, and is driven troika; that is, with three horses abreast. The traveller inside is able either to sit uri or to lie down, stretching himself out as if he were in bed, the vehicle being built long for this purpose. The price of a first-rate kibitka is from twenty to five-and-twenty pounds. The winter-roads in Russia were never known to be better than this year up to the present time, since the frost has been hard, and the quantity of snow on the ground moderate, both of which are necessary conditions for the comfort of the traveller. Russian travelling is not very expensive, even to strangers ; but for those who know how to make a bargain its cheapness is almost fabulous. A gentleman who arrived here a short time ago on business from Kalouga, a distance of four hundred versts, or about three hundred miles, told us that instead of taking post-horses he had hired an istvostchik with a very good kibitka and three horses, for the period of his absence from home, at the rate of twenty-five roubles, or about a guinea, a week, the man undertaking to feed himself and his horses. On these terms the gentleman said that he was driven on his journey sixty miles a-day ; that is to say, that he performed the whole distance in five days. Some of the Russian breeds of horses are wonderfully hardy and enduring ; and I am told they will travel, especially in winter when the draught is light, sixty, eighty, and even a hundred versts, without more than a bait, and without being the worse for their exertions."], [181, "Let. XVIII.] ADVENTURE AT MOSCOW. 157 I have continued throughout the winter to take exercise on foot whenever I have been able to go out of doors, but walking is very fatiguing and disagreeable, owing to the slippery state of the footpath, and the necessaiy impediments of a heavy cloak and goloshes lined with fur. Few Russians like to use their feet when they can find any other mode of conveyance, and I should not have had any companion in my walks, had I not been fortunate enough to meet with a countryman who has been four years in Russia, and who was established here not long ago as tutor in the family of General A \u2014 . Mr. It \u2014 and I have very often walked together, and we have enjoyed much pleasure in meeting with one another in this remote place, in talking together, and in comparing the observations which we have each made on the country. Mr. R\u2014 tells me that two years ago at Moscow he met with an adventure which proved sufficiently serious, while it very nearly cost him his life. I believe 1 have already told you that there are in all considerable towns in Russia licensed istvostchiks, as they are called, who stand in the streets with droschkas for hire in summer, and sledges in winter. For the purpose of identification these men wear, attached to their necks, a tin plate with a number stamped on it. They do not in general bear a very high character, and in large towns it is not considered altogether safe at night to take an unknown istvostchik in the street, especially in the winter. Robberies and murders have occasionally been perpetrated by these men, and a person wrapped up in a cloak is in a very defence less position against an unexpected attack. To return to my friend's story : he came one night out of a coffee-house at Moscow, stepped into a hack sledge, of which there were two or three waiting at the door, and directed the istvostchik to drive him to his lodgings. Unfortunately he neglected to make the porter of the house take down the num ber of the driver, who in that case would have known that he would be made responsible by the police for the safety of his fare, neither did he notice the man's number as he drove along. The night was bitterly cold, and R \u2014 was wrapped up in a fur pelisse with the collar put up round his head. Presently, as he was gliding quietly along, something was thrown over his head"], [182, "[Let. XVIII. 158 ADVENTURE AT MOSCOW. from behind, and he was dragged out upon his back on the snow. Happily, however, the noose slipped off his neck when he fell, and he instantly got on his legs and saw an istvostchik in a sledge driving rapidly away. His own istvostchik sat quite stUl, and persuaded him that the other man was drunk, it being a fete-day, and that his attack was only intended as a joke. R \u2014 was not altogether satisfied with this explanation of the matter, but being in a lonely part of the town, and a good way from home, he at length got into his sledge again, having no suspicion that his own driver was a party to the attack, if a serious one had been intended. He, however, put down the collar of his pelisse, and kept looking over his shoulder to see that no one came up behind. While his atten tion was thus occupied, his driver turned suddenly into a dark street, nearly upsetting the sledge against the post at the corner, and almost, at the same moment a rope was suddenly thrown over Mr. R \u2014 's neck from the front, and he was a second time dragged out upon the snow. Before he could rise, three istvostchiks were upon him, who began stamping on his breast, and rifling his pockets. On his calling out for the police, one of the men put his hand inside the rope around his neck, and nearly strangled him by twisting it, wrhile another thrust a hand into his mouth. A severe bite made him quickly w-ithdraw it, and R \u2014 at the same time fortunately succeeded in slipping the rope off his neck ; otherwise he would undoubtedly have been murdered. He was much hurt and nearly stunned, and the scoundrels* at length left him for dead, finishing their ill treatment with two or three stamps upon the breast. They robbed him of a gold watch and chain and two or three hun dred roubles ; and, what was even worse, they took away his pelisse, cap, and gloves. Thus exposed, he could not possibly have survived long, in twenty-seven degrees of frost. Happily, however, he was able to rise, though with difficulty, wdien he * When we were afterwards at Moscow, on returning one ni _it to our hotel, we found the porter in the act of expelling one of these istvostchiks, and literally kicking him out of the house.

He tied a handkerchief round his head, and, knowing where he was, he made the best of his way to his lodgings, which happened to be not far off. He immediately sent for a surgeon, but it was a period of six weeks before he recovered the effects of his ill-treatment, his face having been severely bruised, and his eyes almost forced out of his head. Police officers came in the morning to receive his account of the attack made upon him, and a week afterwards, when he was able to leave the house, the master of police sent for him, and made three hundred istvostchiks pass in review before him. Among so large a number he was unable positively to identify the culprits, and though five were detained upon suspicion, and further inquiries were made, nothing was eventually discovered, and I need not add that poor R \u2014 never recovered any of his property. His pelisse had cost eight hundred roubles, so that, with the watch and chain, and the money which was stolen, his loss must have amounted to sixty or seventy pounds, in addition to the personal injuries he had sustained. He found afterwards that the attack was premeditated, and that it was intended, not for himself, but for another gentleman, who frequented the same coffee-house, and who was known to carry habitually a considerable sum of money in his pocket.* The possibility of such an outrage being perpe trated with impunity in the heart of the city, and on a bright moonlight night, a circumstance which 1 omitted before to mention, does not say much for the vigilance with which the streets of Moscow are watched at night, t The following anecdotes will show that the acuteness of the police is sometimes pretty severely taxed. A person, dressed in the unifonn of a General, entered the shop of a jeweller at Moscow, and asked to see some of his most valuable diamond rings ; saying that he wanted one as * Garrotting was, I believe, when these Letters were written, a crime unknown in London. t The number of dark lanes with blank walls, and the lonely character of the streets of Moscow, render an efficient patrol extremely requisite, and at the same time, from the vast extent of the city, very difficult to establish.

He was immediately shown a number of very costly and splendid rings, which he examined attentively, seeming much puzzled in his choice. While this was going on, a beggar opened the shop-door, and the jeweller told him to go away ; but the General, observing, in a compassionate tone, that he chanced to have a few copecks in his pocket, beckoned the man to him and dropped them into his hat. The beggar began with the usual whine of the class to thank him, but the General cut him short very gruffly and bade the man be off. He then resmned his examination of the rings, and at last said that they were all so handsome that he could not make up his mind which to select, but that he must bring the lady to choose for herself. The jeweller, as he replaced the box, counting over the lings, perceived that one was missing. He asked the General if he had put one in his pocket by mistake. This was denied, but after some further search the tradesman at last taxed his cus tomer with having stolen a ring. The General was highly indignant at the charge, but the jeweller persisted, saying that he should send for the police to search him ; which at last he actually did, though warned by his Excellency of the danger of making a groundless accusation against a man of his rank. The General was searched, but the ring was not found, and it was now his turn to become the accuser, by charging the shopkeeper with a false attack upon his character. In the end this affair cost the poor jeweller two or three thousand roubles before it was compromised ; besides which he lost a ring worth perhaps as much more. The person whom he was accused of defaming was in truth no impostor as re garded his rank, but was really a General, though his con duct, on this occasion, was somewhat \" unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.\" He had stolen the ring, though it was not about his person when he was searched, as he had dropped it with the copecks into the hat of his confederate, the pre tended beggar.

XVI 1 1.] A LADY SWINDLER. 161 said that by the exercise of her talents in this way she realised, in the course of one year, between three and four thousand pounds ; all of which she spent in the same period, economy not being one of her virtues. \" Light come, light gone,\" says the adage. This lady on one occasion, being in the occupation of a house at Moscow, obtained on credit a quantity of fire wood, to the value of five hundred roubles. Of the best of this she had a considerable quantity piled in her ante-room, apparently for use. She had indeed a use for it, though she did not intend it for the fire, as you will see. She sent for a wholesale dealer, not her creditor, as may7 be supposed, and asked him if he would like to purchase some wood, as she had an estate about forty versts from Moscow, on winch she meant to cut clown a large quantity. The man said that he should have no objection to become the purchaser of all she had for sale, if they could agree about the price. \" Well,\" said she, \" you had better go down to my- property and look at the wood as it stands.\" \" I will go to-morrow,\" said the tradesman, \" but I should like first to know whether we are likely to come to terms.\" The lady then named the acreage which she meant to clear, and, describing the wood as of most excellent quality, she said that the price she expected was forty thousand roubles. \" Well,\" said the tradesman, \" that is rather too much, but, if I find that the article answers your description, I shall not mind offering something like five-and-thii _y thousand.\" The lady said that, as she wanted a sum of money, she was not inclined to dispute about a trifle, though the price she at first named was little enough. She, however, pressed strongly for an immediate conclusion to the business, and offered to take the tradesman in her carriage that evening down into the country to see the wood. He declared that it was impossible for him to leave home at that moment, but that he would go the next day ; to which the lady replied that she could not wait, and that she must try to deal with some one else. At length the man, considering, from the terms proposed and the description he had received of the wood, that the purchase was likely to turn out extremely profitable, said that, as they were so nearly agreed, he would conclude the bargain at once, going M"], [186, "A LADY SWINDLER.

To this proposal she refused to accede, insisting that the man should accompany her into the country that evening if he intended to deal with her. The conversation went on in this manner for some time, the tradesman assuring her that he could not leave his business that day, and the lady urging the point, till at length a happy idea appeared to strike her. \"After all,\" said she, \" perhaps it is unnecessaiy for you to go down at once to my estate, for you can judge of the wood by this sample in the ante-room ; though it is but some inferior stuff which I have been cutting for my present use.\" The dealer was delighted with the specimen she pointed out ; and the bulk of the wood for sale being, as he was assured, of very much better quality that what was shown him, he deter mined not to let so good a bargain slip. He said, therefore, that he felt quite satisfied, and would close at once with the lady's offer if she would accept band-nioney, according to the Russian custom, and would consider the business as settled. \" No,\" said she, \" I am in need of money certainly, and that is the reason why I take so low a price for my wood, but the sum I want is a considerable one, and two or three hundred roubles will be of no use to me.\" \" Well, madam,\" said the dealer, \" I shall not be easy unless the bargain is strack, so pray take this on account,\" handing her notes to the amount of six thousand roubles. The money was with some difficulty received, and the tradesman departed well satisfied. Another dealer was immediately sent for, who bought, for three hundred roubles ready money the unpaid-for stock of wood which had played so useful a part ; and the lady lost no time in shifting her quarters. Long before this affair the police had been in search of her for similar exploits, and at length, a superior officer having discovered her residence, determined that she should not escape, and went himself witli the constables to apprehend her.

[Let. XIX, 164 LETTER XIX. The carnival \u2014 Bleenies \u2014 Ice-hills \u2014 A sledge promenade \u2014 A masquerade \u2014 A Russian dance \u2014 A public dinner. Tamboff, February 24th, 1838. We are now arrived nearly at the conclusion of the carnival, which ends to-morrow (Sunday) at midnight, Lent in the Greek church beginning, not on Ash-\"\\Vednesday, but on the previous Monday. Indeed, the carnival-week itself is, strictly speak ing, a commencement of the fast, or at least a preparation for it ; the use of meat being forbidden at this time, though eggs, milk, and butter are allowed.* This, however, is a distinc tion seldom or never observed by the higher classes, who generally content themselves with abstaining from animal food during a single week of Lent, usually the first or the last. The traders and peasants are, as I have already told you, extremely rigid in observing this and all the other rules of the Greek church. One of the great amusements of the car nival is eating bleenies ; a bleeny being a kind of cake some what like an English crumpet or a thick pancake, and eaten with butter. The carnival is the season in which ice-hills are chiefly in use in Russia, but unfortunately none on a con siderable scale have been erected here this winter, and the only specimen I have seen is a very small one made in the court-yard of a private house for the amusement of the children. For the three last days, as well as on Sunday, there have been grand promenades in the principal street, at which nearly all the inhabitants of the town have appeared, parading up and down in sledges of every description, at a foot's-pace, in two rows like the lines of carriages in Hyde-park. Order is maintained by a number of policemen, aided by a few mounted gendarmes, and the middle space between the two ranks is * The week before Lent is called hitter-week in Russ."], [189, "Let. XIX.] SLEDGE PROMENADE\u2014 MASQUERADE. 165 reserved for sledges which have poles instead of shafts, these being dangerous in the close ranks, as, in the case of a sudden stoppage, the point of the pole may run, not against a back panel, but against the back of the person in the next sledge. We ourselves have joined the procession more than once with a large party, in a sledge holding ten or twelve people, and drawn by four horses, and, our pole procuring for us admission to the open centre-space, we have been able to drive rapidly up and down the street, so as to pass in review the two lines of sledges on either side. The weather during the whole week has been most beautiful \u2014 a hard frost and a bright sun. The Tamboff promenaders, however, instead of enjoying the fine and pleasant portion of the day, do not begin to appear till about four o'clock, when the sun is near the horizon. By five o'clock the street is crowded, and the sledgers continue patiently to glide up and down till nearly seven. This fashion arises, 1 presume, from the Russian habit of wasting two or three hours of the short daylight in a siesta after an early dinner. The lower orders consider it very unlucky not to appear in a sledge at the promenade once at least during the carnival ; and they deem it equally unlucky not to get drunk in the course of the week. There are, however, few among them who run any risk on the ground of sobriety. During the last two days happy has been the master who has had a cook sober enough to dress his dinner, or a servant steady enough to place it on the table. On Thursday there was a public assembly, the last of the season, and yesterday there was a masquerade for the servants and the lower class of tradesmen. We went w-ith some friends into the gallery to witness the scene, and the decorum, and even politeness, which prevailed was quite as great as among the more fashionable society which had appeared in the same room the night before. The ladies' maids were dressed in imitation of their mistresses, contrary to their usual custom, and for the most part they wore neither mask nor fancy dress. The men were equipped in general in various grotesque cos- tumes, being disguised by veils placed over their faces instead of masks ; the veils being thrown off as the wearers became heated with dancing. Waltzes, quadrilles, and Polonaises were executed with tolerable success, but the Russian dance,"], [190, "166 RUSSIAN DANCE. [Let. XIX. which was frequently- repeated, was the great attraction of the evening. This is perfonned by two persons at a time, and is a sort of pantomime representing a courtship. The partners are placed opposite to one another about seven or eight feet apart. The gentleman first advances with many graceful and winning steps to his fair vis-a-vis, who remains in her place. He then figures in various attractive attitudes before her, but in vain, as she turns brusquely round and re jects him, upon which he finally retires. It is now the lady's turn to make similar advances, which are received in like manner with demonstrations of scorn. This alternate advance and retreat is can-ied on for some time ; the talent of the per formers consisting in the coquetry displayed on both sides, and in the grace and variety of their movements. At last, the lad}-, instead of rejecting her suitor, deigns to accept his attentions, and to receive the kiss which concludes the dance. Such is the Russian dance, but yesterday' I only saw it executed correctly once ; the performers on the occasion being a masked man and a very pretty girl dressed in the Russian costume, who both played their parts extremely well. With the exception of this one instance, the perfonners were all men, and the dance in each case became a caricature and a trial of skill and activity between the two partners, which could invent the most extraordinary and grotesque steps and attitudes, and which could keep up longest the violent exertion of this amusement. A farewell dinner was yesterday given by the nobility of the province of Tamboff to the ex-Governor on his departure. I was favoured with an invitation, and was glad of the opportunity of witnessing a public dinner in this country. About seventy gentlemen were assembled on the occasion ; the tables being laid so as to form three sides of an oblong. At four o'clock the ex-Governor arrived, and was received by the principal people in the room ; a military band, which was stationed in the gallery, striking up a national air as he entered. We sat down to dinner almost immediately, the guest of the day being placed in the centre of the cross-table. He was supported on his right hand by my brother-in-law, who, being Marshal, officiated"], [191, "Let. XIX.] PUBLIC DINNER. 167 as President ; and on his left by two Generals, Oushakoff* and Arapoff; I sat opposite to these gentlemen. The dinner was very good, all the best cooks in the town having contributed their services, without, as the event proved, \"spoiling the broth.\" Towards the conclusion of dinner we stood up and drank the Emperor's health in champagne, the wine always used for toasts in Russia. The band played \" God save the King,\" the glasses were replenished, and the President then gave the health of the ex-Governor without speech or comment. We again rose to do honour to the toast, and the compliment was acknowledged in a few words. General Oushakoffs health was next drunk with congratulations on a new Order which he had lately received. He briefly returned thanks, and, dinner being by this time brought to a close, we rose from table, and coffee was handed round the room, where we stood conversing in groups. The ex-Governor soon after made his bow and took his leave, but not till the champagne had once more circulated as a stirrup-cup to wish him a safe journey to Petersburg. A public dinner in England is, as we all know, generally arranged for the purpose of allowing some person or persons an opportunity of making speeches, and expressing opinions on public matters : but this can never be the case in Russia, where no one is permitted to discuss political topics. Under these circumstances the few words in which the toasts wrere yesterday proposed and responded to w-ere far preferable to long and fulsome eulogies of the gentlemen to whom the compliment of drinking their healths was paid ; followed by equally tedious and equally sincere assurances of deep feeling and boundless gratitude in return. * His name is now familiar to English ears, from the command he held in the Crimean campaign of 1855."], [192, "[Let.

Tamboff, March 1st, 1838. This will, I think, be my last letter from Tamboff, for we have already dispatched a great part of our luggage by a carrier, and we mean to set out for Moscow ourselves in a few days. Indeed, from the present state of the weather, it seems that we have no time to lose,* for the frost is giving way, and, if the thaw continues, the ice on the rivers will become un safe, and the winter roads be altogether spoiled. Indeed, I am afraid that they will at any rate be very indifferent, as a good deal of snow has fallen lately, and the weather has become mild, the thermometer having been above the freezing point both yesterday and to-day. Until very lately the roads have been remarkably- good this whiter for travelling, owing to the severity of the frost, and the comparatively small quan tity of snow on the ground. It has now, however, become very deep in this part of the country, and the surface is doubt less much cut up by the incessant traffic of the arbozes. I have already had a little specimen of a winter journey, in an expedition which I made a few days ago with General A \u2014 and Mr. R \u2014 , the English gentleman who, as I have already told you, is residing in his house. The General was setting off on a long journey, intending on his way to visit a large cloth manufactory belonging to a widow-ed sister, which he super intends in her absence ; and he kindly proposed to R \u2014 and myself to accompany him so far on his road, sleeping as he meant to do himself at his sister's house, called Bonderry, be tween fifty and sixty versts hence, and returning home the next * This proved a groundless alarm, as the frost returned with great severity, and lasted till the 10th of April."], [193, "Let. XX.] A NIGHT JOURNEY. 169 day, while he proceeded on his journey. We accepted the in vitation, and set off in a heavy fall of snow, about four o'clock on Sunday evening, Monday being a day on which a Russian will seldom, if he can avoid it, commence a journey. The General and I travelled in a kibitka, a low vehicle with a hood which I have already described to you ; and R \u2014 followed close behind us in a large open sledge, extremely comfortable and well built, and in which we both returned home the next day. The first part of the road was pronounced on the whole to be not amiss, though we met with some tolerably deep holes, or ouchabas, as they are termed. Each vehicle had three horses, and we performed a stage of three-and-thirty versts, nearly five-and-twenty miles, in two hours and five minutes, our shaft horse trotting the whole way. When we proceeded, after changing horses, we found the road mvich worse ; and occa sionally, when travelling at a fast pace, we were thrown so decidedly on our beam-ends, that until I became somewhat used to the thing I thought it impossible that the kibitka could right itself again. This, however, it always did, thanks to its projecting elbow. The night became exceedingly dark ; the last ten versts of our journey lay across au open steppe ; and the snow, which had now been falling heavily for some hours, had completelj obliterated the discoloured line which would otherwise have marked the road, which was now as white as the rest of the plain. It was not, therefore, surprising that in a few minutes wo found, from the horses sinking up to their knees in the soft snow, that we were off the beaten track, while we did not even know whether it lay to the right or to the left. The servants and drivers were now obliged to get down, and to walk about, stamping with their feet, to find the hard line of road. It was a good while before they succeeded in their search, and we had quite time enough to meditate on the prospect of passing the night where we were, an event which seemed by no means improbable. At length, however, the people hit on the beaten track, which was not in reality many yards from us, and we were once more in motion ; one of the men walking before us for some distance to feel the way. AVe did not again lose our road, and, the direction of the wind"], [194, "[Let. XX. CLOTH FACTORY. 170 having been observed, to prevent the chance of our unwittingly turning back and retracing our steps, we at length had the satisfaction of seeing the lights of the village to which we were going. Soon afterwards we found ourselves comfort ably installed in Madame L\u2014 's house, which was large and handsome, and where everything was prepared for our re- ception. The following morning we went with the General over a great part of the manufactory, which is established for the supply of soldiers' cloth. It is one of the largest establish ments of the kind in Russia, the number of persons employed amounting to nearly three thousand. There is a Frenchman at the head of the concern ; but Madame L\u2014 , the proprietress, superintends it herself when at home. This may seem rather an unusual undertaking for a woman ; but in Russia, where nearly every landed proprietor is a manufacturer, ladies often exhibit a taste and a capacity for conducting business which is not often developed among our own countrywomen. After going over the manufactory, which I need not describe, but which seemed well and systematically conducted, we had an early dinner ; and I then took leave of my kind friend the General, and set off with Mr. R \u2014 on our return to Tamboff. The day was most disagreeable ; we had a high wind, with a driving sleet ; and nothing could be more dismal than our view as we crossed the steppe in which we had lost our road the night before. A flat waste, covered with snow, surrounded us on every side, the horizon being obscured by the falling sleet. As we approached the boundary of the plain, the trees and other objects which indistinctly presented themselves gave the idea of a shore for which we were steering across the sea. The road abounded in ouchabas, and our sledge pitched up and down, and from side to side, like a boat in rough water. At the same time our battered persons bore undeniable testi mony- to the hard solidity of the surface over which we were travelling. It grew dark before we reached Tamboff; and we missed our way more than once in a plain four or five miles wide which skirts the town. The lights, however, which were visible before us, marked our direction ; and by some times catching sight of a verst-post, and sometimes of the black"], [195, "Let.

A kibitka is a very comfortable carnage to recline in, and the motion is highly agreeable at a rapid pace on a fair road ; but the jolt, when the kibitka plunges through an ouchaha, will make the fire flash out of the eyes. I have seen quite enough in this little trip to convince me that a long journey at this moment will not be pleasant ; for the best season for winter travelling is now past, and we must expect bad roads and changeable weather. We shall therefore be doubtless very happy when we can look back upon the nine hundred miles of snow which we must traverse between Tamboff and Petersburg. We do not mean to stay long among our friends at Moscow, for fear the winter should break up and detain us. Travelling at that moment is in every way inconvenient ; and it is difficult, if not impossible, to cross the rivers during the floods produced by the melting of the snow in spring.

You wiU perceive by the date of this letter that we have completed the journey which we were about to undertake when I last wrote ; and you will be glad to find that we have made so long a stride on our way homewards ; for, in point of time, Petersburg- will be as near to England as to Tamboff when the navigation of the Gulf of Finland is open. This, however, will not be the case for some weeks to come. The Baltic steamboats will not begin to ply till the second week in May at the earliest. We arrived here on Saturday last, having spent ten days in Moscow on our way ; and before I give you an}r account of our journey, I may as well say, that, although Petersburg is now so full that it is difficult to meet with lodgings, we have been for tunate enough to engage an excellent set of rooms, clean and well-furnished, in one of the best situations in the town \u2014 the Little Million \u2014 at the Hotel de la Bourse, kept by a French man.

The thaw which excited our alarm continued for"], [197, "Let. XXI.] DEPARTURE FROM TAMBOFF. 173 two days after I wrote. On Saturday (the 3rd) Reaumur's thermometer stood six degrees above the freezing-point, about forty-five or forty-six degrees of Fahrenheit. The snow was melting fast, the streets were flowing with water, and the accounts winch we received of the roads were such that we determined to risk no longer delay, but to set out the following night on our journey, instead of waiting till Tuesday, as we had previously fixed. We feared, indeed, that we had already postponed moving too long ; but about half an hour after we had determined on this precipitate flight, a friend came in and said he had good news for us. He told us that the wind had just changed to the north, and that we might expect a return of frost. In fact, to our great delight, before we went to bed, the thermometer was below zero, and the snow was beginning to grow crisp again, and the following morning we had three degrees of cold. We did not however choose again to alter our plans or trust to the continuance of this favourable weather, so by the evening everything was ready for our departure. The last moments of our stay do not tempt me to dwell upon them. We took leave of our countryman R \u2014 , whom we left with much regret in this distant spot, and we said farewell to some other friends. Finally we bade adieu to my brother and sister-in-law, whose kindness and hospitality had been unbounded during the long period which we had spent in their house ; and who, on our departure, as during our stay, forgot nothing which could contribute to our comfort and accommo dation. At length, well wrapped up, we arranged ourselves in the kibitka, and set out a quarter of an hour before mid night, to the great satisfaction of our Russian attendant, who would not willingly have commenced the journey on Monday. The road, as we expected, was in a very indifferent state ; but the cold, which at first was not intense, increased rapidly, and therefore the snow became hard. Though its surface was much broken, we were able to proceed rapidly, and, by eight o'clock in tho morning, we were about forty miles from Tamboff. We had intended to breakfast at Kazloff, but our istvostchik drove us through the town without stopping, and we reached"], [198, "[Let. XXI. 174 MOTION OF KIBITKA. no other place where any tolerable accommodation was to be found till five o'clock in the afternoon. Having travelled for seventeen hours without interruption, except to change horses, we were by this time somewhat chilled, very much cramped, and exceedingly hungry, as it was out of the question to eat in the kibitka, all our provisions being frozen hard. I had slept the greater part of the way in spite of our incessant tossing up and down, and from side to side, in the ouchabas. We had now travelled a hundred and seventy versts, and in the small town of Riask we enjoyed the luxury of entering clean and warm rooms, the same in which we had breakfasted on our way from Moscow in the autumn. Here we disen cumbered ourselves of cloaks, warm boots, and caps, which we placed around the stove, while our basket, well stored by our kind friends at Tamboff with everything we could require on the road, was produced. A steaming samovar soon made its appearance ; and hot tea and cold partridge pie were not the less agreeable for our seventeen hours' tossing over the snow. After remaining here about an hour and a half, and getting thoroughly warmed, we wrapped ourselves up once more, and, travelling all night, reached Riazan about eight o'clock on the Tuesday morning. At Riazan we got a comfortable break fast at a tolerable inn. Wre had found the road very bad all night, and we constantly felt the sensation of being upset when the kibitka tilted sideways on the projecting elbow. After a time, however, we paid little attention to these occur rences, or even to the shock with which the vehicle righted itself after one of the runners had been lifted off the ground. Owing to the piercing wind which met us, we were forced to keep the leather veil, which closed up the front of the kibitka, almost always lowered, so that we travelled for the most part entirely in the dark, consoling ourselves by observing, when ever we looked forth, that nothing could be more dreary or dismal than the monotonous waste of snow which extended around us on every side as we journeyed along. From Riazan we were obliged to engage horses, our team beino a troika, to take us without changing all the way to Columnia, a distance of more than seventy miles. These horses were of the hardy Bashkir breed, which I mentioned in my account"], [199, "Let. XXI.] JOURNEYING'ALONG RIVERS. 175 of tho horse-fair at Tamboff. They seemed equally insensible to fatigue and to cold, accomplishing their long stage with apparent ease in ten hours, including a stoppage to bait of two hours. During the bait they w -ere not unharnessed or cleaned, but they stood to feed in an open shed, where their shaggy coats speedily became stiff with ice, as the moisture from their bodies froze. We left Riazan at ten in the morning, and we reached Columnia by eight in the evening. During the greater part of this day we travelled along the ice of the Occa, and of another river which runs into it. So long as we were on the ice the road was smooth and good, but the banks which we had to ascend and descend were steep and dangerous, and moro than once we were nearly upset, owing to the care lessness of our istvostchik, who drove us down these slippery places in such a manner that the kibitka overpowered the horses and swung round sideways. Towards evening the frost became very intense, and when we reached Columnia we were told that there were then twenty-five degrees of cold by Reaumur, and this with a searching wind. We, however, stopped here no longer than was necessary to procure horses, w-hich we did after a long delay. At the next station we supped, and we were obliged to proceed again with the same horses. The road, during these two stages, was worse than ever, and we got on very slowly, expecting constantly to be upset in spite of our previous experience, and it was ten o'clock on the Wednesday morning before we reached the second station ; the horses which had brought us from Columnia being: _> C5 thoroughly jaded before they had finished their journey.

We drove to the Hotel du Nord in the Tverskoi, to which we had been recommended, and where we established ourselves. I cannot say much for the comfort or cleanliness of our apartments. The only picturesque object which we saw during the whole"], [200, "WINTER SCENE\u2014 MOSCOW HOTELS. [Let. XXI. 176 journey was a village through which we passed on the last morning, a little after six o'clock, just as the sun was rising. It being the time at which the peasants light their stoves, the smoke was curling iu the bright clear air from nearly every house in the village ; and the long straggling street happened to be filled by a large arboze (or string of carriers' sledges), the coats of the horses, and the long beards and fur caps of the drivers, being white with frost. The whole scene, which, lighted up by the rising sun, was really very striking, fonued no bad picture of a winter morning in Russia, affording a characteristic view of the dwellings, costumes, and occupa tions of the people at this season of the year. We never suffered much from cold during our journey, intense as the frost was. Its most unpleasant effect was its congealing the breath in such a manner as to cover our fur collars with icicles. These became partially melted on touching the skin, so that it was very difficult to keep our faces from being constantly wet. We were always obliged to dry at the fire everything that had been within reach of the mouth, whenever we entered a house. I have little to say of our stay at Moscow, which only lasted ten days, during which time we both suffered much from colds and sore throats. The weather was very unpleasant, and the streets so encumbered with snow,* that it was excessively disagreeable to drive about on account of the ouchabas, while it was out of the question to walk any distance, owing to the slippery and neglected state of the foot pavements. Our hotel, morever, was so uncomfortable that we should hardly have remained as long as we did, had not M \u2014 's family, with whom we spent most of our time, been in town. The hotels in Moscow are, I believe, celebrated for dirt and discomfort, and the Hotel du Xord possesses these qualities in perfection. t * The streets of Moscow, at this time, from the sandy colour and loose consistency of the snow, had exactly the appearance of being thickly covered with moist sugar. t We found too late that we ought to have gone to Mrs. Howard's hotel, which is said to be really clean and comfortable."], [201, "Let. XXI.] ROAD TO PETERSBURG. 177 Once at Moscow we considered the remaining five hundred miles of our journey as nothing in comparison to the four hundred which we had already travelled, taking it for granted that the high-road between the two capitals was never in a very bad state, even in winter. We hired a diligence built for four passengers in addition _ to the conductor and driver, paying three hundred roubles (about twelve guineas) for the journey to Petersburg, with a guinea to the conductor on our arrival. Comfortably arranged in this vehicle ; a vasok, consisting of two coupes in one body, fixed on runners and without springs ; we started from Moscow on Monday evening the 19th, about six o'clock, hoping to arrive at Petersburg on Thursday. Our expectations, however, of a good road were grievously disappointed. As soon as we got into the country we found a snow-storm raging in full force ; while the road was so bad from the quantity of soft snow and from the drifts, that we were four hours and a half in performing a stage of not more than twenty miles. We stopped for supper at one of the Imperial inns which I described to you last summer. We intended to proceed immediately, but our conductor, who spoke French and German, came in presentty to say that some travellers, who had just come up on their way to Moscow, gave such an account of the road, especially in one spot, where a diligence was already sticking fast, that he thought we had better remain where we were till morning, when, at least, if we got into a difficulty we might obtain assistance. We ac cordingly wrapped ourselves in our cloaks and lay down on sofas to wait for daylight ; and the next day we had every reason to be satisfied with our prudence in not travelling in the dark. We were dragged along with much difficulty, and were nearly six hours performing a stage of less than three and-twenty miles. I need not trouble you with a detail of every stage. Suffice it to say that we were obliged to stop ao-ain the second night for some hours, and that the journey the following day was worse than anything w-e had hitherto experienced.* The ouchabas were deep and wide, and we were * Great numbers of men were employed along the road in filling up the holes and levelling the snow, and in some places the snow-plough was also N"], [202, "[Let. XXI. ROAD TO PETERSBURG. 178 aware that a close carriage with luggage on the roof is more readily overturned than a kibitka. We more than once stuck fast in the bottom of a hole, and were obliged to get out before the horses could extricate the diligence. At other times, to avoid this difficulty, the istvostchik would put his horses full gallop at an ouchaba, in order that the impetus with which we descended one side of the ditch might carry us up the other side. W re escaped all misfortunes, however, except aching bones, and arrived on Wednesday evening at Torjok, which we had expected to reach in twenty-four hours instead of forty-eight. From this spot we found that the road gradually improved, the quantity of snow diminishing as we proceeded northwards, so that all that night and all the next day we glided jsmoothly and rapidly along. Late on Thursday night we lay down to rest on sofas for about three hours, and, starting again before daylight, we reached Novogorod to breakfast. Here the snow, which farther south lay so deep, was hardly sufficient to cover the ground, and we had already met diligences travelling on wheels. During the remainder of our journey, a distance of more than two hundred versts, we experienced as much diffi culty from scarcity of snow as we had in the earlier part of our journey from its superabundance. The road in some places was quite bare, or was covered only with a thin coating of ice, which in the day-time was thawed by the sun, so that we fre quently stuck fast in the mud. At length, two stages from Petersburg, we found a diligence upon wheels, into which we transferred ourselves and our luggage, and, meeting with no further difficulties, arrived at Petersburg, as I have already told you, on Saturday evening ; having been five days and nights, instead of three, upon the road. We drove to a private hotel, where we got temporary accommodation, and yesterday we moved into our present quarters. When I wrote from Moscow in the autumn, I told you that it was yearly losing ground in point of society. The rich and fashionable, with all who seek amusement or promotion, flock to Petersburg ; which, as the residence of the Court and the seat of Government, affords in these respects far higher attrac- in use to remove the drifts; but the snow fell faster than it could be cleared away, and as soon as one hole was filled up another was formed."], [203, "Let. XXI.] PRINCE SERGE GALITZIN. 179 tions than the ancient capital can hold out. I am assured that there is but one private house in Moscow which is at all kept up on a splendid scale, and that house I fortunately had an op portunity of visiting ; although, from an accidental delay, my letter of introduction to its owner, Prince Serge Galitzin, did not arrive till two or three days before our departure from Moscow. It, however, immediately procured me the honour of a call from the Prince, accompanied by an invitation to a party ; and he was kind enough, when I saw him, to express his regret at not hearing sooner of our arrival at Moscow ; adding, that he had expected to see us in the autumn at his villa in the neighbourhood, when we passed through Moscow on our way from Yaroslav. This visit we had intended to pay, meaning to drive over in the morning and to return in the evening, but some accident had deprived us of the pleasure. Prince Serge, who has a large fortune, and who lives in a manner suited to it, is a specimen of modern refinement engrafted on the character of the old Russian Grand Seigneur, a race which is now become nearly extinct. The Russian nobles have sel dom fortune enough to unite refinement with splendour and profusion ; and they have generally learned to prefer the com fort of a moderate-sized well-furnished house, with a suitable establishment, to the cold and empty magnificence of their ancient overgrown palaces, and ill-appointed retinues of ser vants. The huge old house at Moscow is deserted for a modem residence at Petersburg. I have probably told you, in some former letter, how little it is the custom in this country for servants to announce a visitor, and this to a stranger is rather embarrassing, as, on entering a crowded room, he does not know where to find the master or mistress of the house. I experienced this difficulty in some degree when I went to Prince Serge Galitzin's party. After walking through a long suite of empty saloons, I atlast came to the apartments which were lighted up, and then I had to seek my host, whom I had never yet seen, in two large rooms filled with card-players, every one of whom was equally a stranger to me. The servants, of whom there were a great num ber in attendance, motioned me on, and pointed to the right ; and when I had at length penetrated into the inner room, the n 2"], [204, "[Let. XXI. 180 MOSCOW HOSPITALS. master of the house rose from one of the tables, and, coming for- ward, shook hands with me, and begged me to sit by him till his rubber was ended. When the Prince had finished his game, after talking to me for some time, he proposed to show me his pictures, of which he has a fine collection. A servant was sum- moned with lights, and we went through the greater part of the house, which is very fine, and on a grand scale, examining the paintings, of which the Prince pointed out the most meritorious and valuable. He talked much of Lord Londonderry, who had visited him the year before ; and he asked whether the Mar- quis' house in London was finer than his own, a question I could not answer. The grand dining-room was a splendid apartment, its chief ornament being a beautiful piece of sculp ture ; a female figure and a child, the size of life, in white marble, which the Prince had brought from Italy. When we returned from our tour of inspection, I was introduced to two or three persons, with whom I conversed till it was time to take leave. Among others was the Prince of Georgia, the grandson of the last King, who, as I have told y-ou, lost his crown, while his son forfeited his liberty- in attempting to regain it, and was imprisoned for life in a Russian fortress. Moscow abounds in charitable institutions, of which I only visited two, namely, the Cheremetieff and the Galitzin Hospi tals. Both are noble establishments, intended for the reception of sick people, and for the maintenance of a certain number of old men and women. Each owes its foundation to the muni ficence of a private individual, the one having been endowed by Count Cheremetieff, and the other by a Prince Galitzin, uncle to Prince Serge, the present director of it. The former is the richer institution of the two ; and, in addition to its other charities, it annually provides marriage portions for a certain number of young women. It is impossible to speak too highly of the order and clean liness which appeared in every part of these two hospitals, over each of which I was conducted by the medical gentlemen in attendance. The Cheremetieff has the advantage in point of architecture ; but the same system is apparently followed in the interior management of both. There can be little doubt that in many cases the patients derive as much benefit from"], [205, "Let. XXI.] APPEARANCE OF MOSCOW. 181 the spacious rooms in which they are placed, and the pure and wholesome air which they breathe, as from the medical treat ment which they undergo. In each hospital there is a church for the inmates. I passed through that at the Galitzin while a funeral service was going on. The coffin was placed on a bier in the centre of the church, the lid being off, so that the face of the dead body was exposed. At the head of the corpse were placed three lighted candles. Near the Cheremetieff Hospital we were shown a high tower, of singular architecture, now used for raising water to distribute over the city. It was built in former days by a rich merchant, named Souchareff, for the charitable purpose of furnishing employment to the poor in a time of scarcity. I will conclude the subject of Moscow by observing that, striking as the Kremlin is, and fine as many of the public and private buildings are, much of the city has more the air of an overgrown country town than of a capital. There is a de- ficiency of grand arteries ; and a great part of the town is filled with a multitude of irregular narrow streets, flanked often, on one or both sides, by a dead wall. There is a provincial rusticity, moreover, in the style of the equipages. The principal cause, however, of the impression which Moscow made upon me in this respect is probably the general dulness of the streets, which, owing to the immense extent of the town in proportion to its po- pulation, present none of that thronged and bustling appearance which one naturally looks for in a great capital. At Peters- burg the case is very different, and the streets, which were empty and deserted in June, are now crowded with handsome carriages and sledges, as well as with foot passengers. Some of the principal thoroughfares are indeed so crowded that it requires caution to avoid being knocked down in crossing from one side to the other, and the shouts of the coachmen, \" pddi, padi,\" \"get out of the way,\" are incessant. They drive exces- sively fast, but they will avoid hurting you, if possible, for fear of the punishment, which is to be made a soldier. I will now conclude this long letter by assuring you that we are very happy to find ourselves at the end of our journey, and not at all inclined to set out upon another until the weather"], [206, "182 DANGERS OF TRAVEL.

We are in hopes that the winter is now nearly over, as the frost yesterday began to give way, and the thaw is proceeding rapidly. Everybody will rejoice heartily at the arrival of spring, for such a winter as this has been few persons can remember. Greater degrees of cold have been known ; but the duration of the frost, and its continued severity for nearly five months, is almost unprecedented even in Russia. So late as this day week (the 4th of April) there were in Petersburg nineteen degrees of cold,* and in the country twenty. Tho ice on the Neva is from forty-two to forty-four inches thick, and the ground is frozen to the depth of six feet. We went yesterday to see the Imperial manufactory at Alexandrovsky, about thirteen versts hence, in compliance with an invitation from General Wilson, who, for thirty years, has superintended the establishment, and who is a most excel lent and popular person. The articles manufactured here are of various kinds. In one department, cotton is spun ; in another, sheets, table-linen, &c, are woven ; and in a third are made all the playing-cards which are used in Russia, as the Crown reserves the monopoly of this manufacture. About three thousand operatives are employed altogether ; and of these nearly one thousand are foundlings, boys and girls. At twelve years old the foundlings are brought to the factory from the hospital where they have been reared, and they remain there till the age of twenty-one, when the young men become their own masters, may marry, and may quit the manufactory, or may remain as paid workmen, according as they please. The girls are allowed to marry at eighteen. * By Reaumur."], [208, "[Let. XXII. 184 FOUNDLINGS. From the moment of their arrival at the manufactory, these foundlings, in addition to their food, clothing, and lodging, receive small monthly wages, half of which is given to them by way of pocket-money, and the other half is placed at interest in a savings-bank ; so that when they come of age, or marry, they have a little fund of three or four hundred roubles with which to begin the world. Immediately after our arrival at Alexandrovsky we were taken to see the young operatives at dinner, which, it being Lent, the only fast in the year which they are required to keep, consisted of soup-maigre, fish, rye-bread, and quass \u2014 all served in pewter. The day was an ordinary working-day, and there was no preparation for visit ors, our arrival, owing to a misunderstanding, being, in fact, quite unexpected. Nothing, however, could exceed the neat ness and perfect cleanliness of these young manufacturers, more especially of the girls, with their well-brushed hair neatly braided on the forehead, and fastened behind with a comb, every head being arranged alike. A wooden screen, about six feet high, ran down the middle of the hall to separate the two sexes. Leaving them at their meal, we were shown through the dormitories, which were clean, airy, and comfortable ; a convenient washing-room, well supplied with water, being attached to each set. When we returned to the hall, dinner was over, and at our appearance a bell was rung, when the whole body, young men, boys, and girls, stood up and sung a hymn ; at the con clusion of which the bell gave the signal for departure, and the two sexes moved out of the hall at different ends, in the most orderly manner. I was told by General Wilson's brother that in the thirty years during which he has had the management of this manufactory there has never been more than one instance of a girl misconducting herself; a fact which strongly attests the excellence of the regulations which are observed. This, like all the other public establishments, such as barracks and hospitals, which I have seen in this country, appears a perfect model of order and cleanliness ; a fact the more striking in Russia, since there is usually abundant room for improvement in these respects in private houses.

On the day before Good Friday we went to the Kazan church, to see the ceremony of the Metropolitan washing the feet of twelve priests. In the centre of the church, which was much crowded, a platform was raised about five feet from the ground, and on this were placed thirteen chairs ; six on each side for the priests, and one at the top for the Metropolitan. Mass was first celebrated at the grand altar, and, at the con clusion, the Metropolitan ascended the platform, and took his seat facing the altar, while six or seven deacons placed them selves behind his chair. A service was now chanted, and soon after it had begun two bishops made their appearance on the platform. They bowed to the altar, and then to the Metropolitan, and seated themselves on either side of him. Two priests followed, and took their places in the two next chairs in like manner. Others succeeded them, and at last the twelve chairs were filled. The Metropolitan then rose up, laid aside his ribbons and decorations, took off several robes one after another, and girded himself with a long towel, the chanted service still continuing. He then passed round to each of the twelve priests in succession, with a large silver basin, and went through the form of washing their feet, a deacon accompanying and assisting him. This part of tho"], [211, "Let. XXIII.] EASTER CEREMONY. 187 ceremony occupied but a veiy short time, and the service was immediately afterwards concluded. It is impossible to enter a Russian church without being struck by the want of decorum which the absence of seats produces. The whole congregation, except a few persons of consequence, who are placed near the altar, stand pell-mell, without order or regularity ; so that when the church is full the crowd becomes an absolute mob, and those who are attend ing to the service are disturbed by the moving of others around them. The services in the Greek church are many of them very long, and the fatigue of standing during the whole time is very great. On the Saturday night, about eleven o'clock, I went again to the Kazan church to see Easter Sunday ushered in. There was a sort of illumination in the streets, earthen lamps being placed in rows on the edge of the foot-pavement ; but the light which they produced was far from brilliant. The lamps were wide apart, and the effect very paltry. There was an unusual bustle in the whole town ; the pavements were crowded with foot passengers, and a ceaseless stream of carriages with lighted lamps was rolling along. Inside the church, near the door, were two stalls for the sale of wax-candles of various sizes, and these could scarcely be furnished fast enough to supply the demand. Almost every per son who entered bought at least one taper, and many provided themselves with five or six : not, however, lighting them as yet, but keeping them in readiness for midnight. After look ing for some time at the crowd which kept moving in and out of the church, I went and stood in front of it until, at half past eleven, a rocket was sent up, and a gun fired from the fortress : this being a signal for divine service to commence in all the churches in Petersburg. I did not hear the second gun which the fortress fired to announce the actual commence ment of Easter-day ; but all the people at midnight lighted their candles, and a procession issued from the church, and made the circuit of its walls outside. The ecclesiastics who headed it bore the cross and sacred banners, and chanted a ser vice, while the congregation followed them with lighted tapers. I observed that many of the common people in the crowd"], [212, "[Let. XXIII. 188 THE MAHOMETAN SENTRY. had in their hands what appeared to be plates tied up in napkins ; and I find that this was the first meat which they intended to eat on the conclusion of Lent, and which they brought to church, according to an ancient custom, to be blessed by the priests. I should have told you that on Good Friday all the Court go, \u2014 the gentlemen as usual in uniform, but the ladies in deep mourning, \u2014 to kiss the representation of our Saviour's tomb in the Palace Chapel. On Easter Sunday nothing goes on but felicitations, presenting of eggs (the emblem of the Resur rection), and kissing. Servants may kiss their masters or mistresses ; and a peasant may kiss the Emperor, though per haps in the latter case the privilege is not very often exercised. \" Christos voscress,\" \" Christ has risen,\" is the universal saluta tion ; and it is a curious thing to see two peasants or trades men meet in the street. \" Christos voscress,\" they cry out ; off go their hats and caps ; and then with one accord they rush together and inflict on one another three kisses on the cheek * \u2014 right, left, right. After this each replaces his hat, first making a most profound bow to the other, and at length they separate. There is a story told of the present Emperor, who once on Easter-day, passing a sentrj-, saluted him as usual with the words \" Christ is risen.\" \" No; he 's not, your Ma jesty,\" said the soldier, presenting arms. \" He 's not ! \" said the Emperor ; \" what do you mean ? This is Easter Sunday.\" \" I know that, please your Majesty,\" replied the man ; \" but I am a Mahometan.\" The Russians, high and low, are great observers of times and seasons ; and custom requires that at Easter, as well as at Christmas, all persons should visit their acquaintances to congratulate them on the occasion of the festival. Several carriages broke down last week in the peiformance of this arduous duty, for the streets were in a terrible state, and some almost impassable, owing to the thaw ; the snow not having * The custom of men kissing one another is as common in Russia as in Germany.

Opposite to the Admiralty, in the open Flace, large wooden booths had been erected for theatrical and other exhibitions, and in front of the booths were what are called katchellies, namely, swings, merry-go-rounds, and similar inventions. These con tinued in full play and in high favour during the whole of Easter-week. On the three last days of the week there was a carnage promenade in front of the katchellies ; and in the throng a string of twenty coaches-and-six, followed by six outriders, was conspicuous. The carriages were plain and neat, painted green, and all exactly alike, with handsome powerful horses, equipped in heavy German harness, and the coachman, posti lions, footmen, and outriders, dressed in scarlet great-coats with capes, and in cocked hats, leather breeches, and jack boots. The coachmen were evidently not much accustomed to driving four-in-hand,* and an English whip would hardly have ad mired their manner of handling the reins. These were Court equipages, and each carriage contained six young ladies be longing to the public institutions or schools at Petersburg, under the patronage of the Empress, who annually bestows this indulgence upon the pupils. The last and gayest of the promenades took place, according to custom, the day before yesterday, being the Sunday after Easter. It was attended by the Court and all the fashionable world, and every vehicle in Petersburg was placed in requi sition. Wre remained at our windows, and we could not have been better placed, as, owing to the police regulations, all the carriages were obliged to pass down our street in order to enter the Admiralty Place, and from about half-past five in the evening the stream for two hours was incessant. Soon after six o'clock the officers of the regiment of Gardes a eheval, who had been gradually assembling, drew up under our windows in scarlet uniforms, waiting to escort the Emperor, who in the course of half an hour drove up, seated as usual in a plain open carriage with a pair of horses, and accompanied by his eldest son. * The horses were driven, not in the Russian style, but in English, or rather German fashion."], [214, "[Let.

The evening was exceedingly fine, and the display was well worth seeing. As it was known that the Emperor would mount his horse in that spot, a great crowd was assembled to see him : and I could not help being struck by the manner in which he was received, though I am told it was exactly in accordance with his own wishes. In England the air would have been rent on such an occasion by the cheers with which a popular sovereign would have been received \u2014 and popular the Emperor undoubt edly is, especially in Petersburg. Here all was calm and silent. Every head was uncovered, but neither hat nor hand kerchief was waved in the air ; and to have waved one, or to have uttered a shout, would undoubtedly have been considered a gross breach of etiquette, and the enthusiasm of the offender would have been quickly checked by the police. Nothing can be more graceful and dignified than \u2022 the manner in which the Emperor acknowledges the salutes which he receives as he drives about. He has the royal talent of appearing to direct his attention to each individual in particular, and he never fails to return every salute, even that of a private soldier.

Yesterday the exhibitions and katchellies ceased, and workmen are now busily employed in removing the booths and in clearing the ground.

Petersburg, May 9th, 1838. Ever since the conclusion of Easter-week, until yesterday, we have had delightful weather. On the morning of the twenty eighth of last month, eighteen days after the commencement of the thaw, the ice on the Neva broke up, the floating-bridge was removed to let it pass, and in the course of three or four hours the river was sufficiently free to allow the safe passage of boats ; indeed, scarcely a piece of ice was to be seen. No boats, how ever, are allowed to ply until the following ceremony, which dates from the reign of Peter the Great, has been performed. The Commandant of the fortress, under a salute from its guns, crosses the river in his barge, and has an audience of the Em peror, to present him with a certain silver cup, filled with the water of the Neva; and his Majesty returns the cup filled, instead of water, with gold coins. After this the navigation of the Neva is considered as open. We are still, however, reminded of our northern latitude. The ice in the Gulf of Finland is still firm ; and since yesterday the Neva, which for ten days past had reflected nothing but blue sky and bright sun, has been nearly covered with floating ice, as white as snow, drifting rapidly down under the united influence of wind and current. This ice comes from the La doga, a lake more than two hundred miles long and a hundred and fifty broad, out of which the Neva issues forty or fifty miles above Petersburg. When the ice of the lake breaks up, and passes down the Neva, it produces for some days a return of winter here. The floating bridges are removed, and the river is encumbered with huge masses of ice, grinding and crashing in the strong current, so that the passage becomes"], [217, "Let. XXIV.] ERECTION OF A PILLAR. 193 perilous for boats ; while the air itself is chilled, and the bitter north wind brings driving storms of sleet and snow. Some daj-s ago I went to see a pillar placed in the new church of St. Isaac, which is now in progress. The operation was extremely interesting, from the size of the pillar and the height at which it was placed \u2014 it being the second tier or story of columns on which the workmen were engaged. The last pillar was erected yesterday, and the colonnade, which is circular, is now complete. Its base must be a hundred and thirty or forty feet from the ground, and each pillar is a solid block of granite, forty-two feet high, and weighing five thousand poods, or upwards of eighty tons. The columns on the ground-tier, each of which is also a monolith, are fifty-six feet high, and they weigh eleven thousand poods each. \"When I reached the platform to which the pillar was to be raised, I had below me a panorama of Petersburg and of the country around for many a mile ; the most interesting part of the prospect being the Gulf of Finland, dow ti which I could see as far as Cronstadt. The day was warm and bright, and the air was free from cloud or smoke. From the platform down to the next stage, a depth of about eighty feet, was fixed a strong timber frame, covered with pdanks, so as to form a very steep inclined plane. At the bottom of this slide, when I first looked down, the column to be raised was lying horizontally on rollers ; it was girthed round with very thick ropes drawn very tight, and was padded underneath. Other ropes, or rather cables, secured to these girths, passed along the column, crossing each other over its lower end, and it was lashed to strong planks which lay under it, that the polish of the stone might not be injured in ascending the slide. Over the base on which the column was to stand was placed a high frame work of strong timbers. The cables, twelve in number, attached to the pillar, passed through blocks fixed in the frame, and, with the aid of one moveable pulley to each, were drawn by twelve capstans, each manned by fourteen or sixteen men. There were two extra capstans for the purpose of guiding the lower end of the pillar when suspended in the air. Altogether, upwards of two hundred men were employed in the operation. \"When all was ready, the capstans began to turn, and by o"], [218, "[Let. XXIV. 194 GRAND PARADE. degrees the column, instead of lying in a horizontal position, rested on the inclined plane, which was well greased. Up this it began slowly to ascend, two men standing on its upper end, to be ready in case of the cables becoming en tangled. The capstans were all numbered, and the superin tendent at the top, calling out sometimes to one gang and sometimes to another to move faster or slower, kept all the ropes drawing equally. The column at length reached the top of the inclined plane, and it was then raised tmtil it was hanging in the high wooden frame exactly over the base on which it was to stand. A coin was dropped into a small hole in the centre of the base, which was then covered with a sheet of lead ; and the tackling round the lower end of the pillar being cut and cleared away, it was lowered gently into its place. The whole operation, which was now complete, had occupied about two hours, from the time the capstans began to work until the pillar rested upon its base. The church of St. Isaac will be an edifice not unworthy of Petersburg, and it will be a remarkable monument of a century which is not an age of cathedral building. About forty thousand pounds have been annually expended upon it for some years past, and the exterior will not be com pleted for at least two more. The church is to be a few feet higher than St. Paul's, with a dome, the roof of which will be gilt, of nearly the same size with the dome of our cathedral. No materials are emploj-ed in any part of the edifice but marble, stone, brick, and metal, so that the building will be fire-proof. Four days ago we had the good fortune to witness in the Champ-de-Mars a splendid military spectacle. About forty thousand men were on the ground, including nine thousand cavalry, one hundred and twenty-eight pieces of artillery, and a pontoon-train. The whole belonged to the corps of the Imperial Guards, and formed, therefore, I presume, the finest body of troops in the empire. The day was lovely, and the coup-d'\u0153il most superb. At twelve o'clock the Emperor ar rived on the ground, followed by a numerous suite. The drums beat, and the troops cheered as he galloped down the line and through the ranks. By the time he had completed this rapid"], [219, "Let. XXIV.] REVIEW OF THE TROOPS. 195 inspection, his horse being already covered with foam, the Empress and the Grand Duchesses arrived on the ground in a carriage-and-four, with postilions in the English style, followed by four or five other court-carriages, some with four and some with six horses. The Emperor then mounted a fresh horse and rode through the ranks by the side of her Majesty's car riage, which was afterwards drawm up opposite the centre of the line. The Emperor took his station on horseback by her side, and the troops began to march past. The infantry passed first, preceded only by the mounted Circassians, or, as they are here tenned, the Mamelukes of the Guard, in number about forty or fifty. These horsemen wear scarlet uniforms made after the fashion of their country-, and are a wild and pic turesque-looking body of men. Some are armed with carbines, and some have bows and arrows at their backs. The infantry was followed by a train of foot-artillery ; after which there was a halt for a few minutes, and then the cavalry came up, led by the regiment of Chevaliers-gardes, with their Colonel, the Grand Duke Alexander, the Heir-apparent, at their head. The band of each regiment stationed itself oppo site the Emperor, and played while the regiment marched past, and each company or troop as it came up saluted the Emperor with a shout, according to the Russian custom. As soon as the regiment had been reviewed, the Colonel was called up and complimented by the Emperor. There were four regiments of Cuirassiers, a portion of each being Lancers, a regiment of Horse Grenadiers, and a splendid regiment of Hussars of the Guard in scarlet uniforms, and mounted on greys. These were followed by Lancers, Cossacks, and a superb train of Horse Artillery ; the whole force being wound up by the Pontoon Train which I have mentioned. After a halt fora few minutes the whole of the troops passed a second time before the Emperor, the infantry at double-quick, after which they marched off the ground, and the cavalry at a trot or hand-gallop. The review was to have concluded with a grand charge of cavalry, but this man\u0153uvre was counter manded in consequence of the number of accidents which had occurred at a sort of rehearsal a few days before, on w-hich occasion fourteen officers got falls, and were more or less hurt; o 2"], [220, "[Let.

The immense plains in the south of Russia furnish most of the horses for the cavalry, w-hich is exceedingly well mounted, and the horses of each corps beautifully matched. The price allowed for troopers does not exceed two or three hundred roubles per horse, but the commission to purchase them is given to officers of good fortune, who are glad to obtain leave of absence on this ground, and to purchase good horses ; making up out of their own pockets the difference between the Govern ment allowance and the actual cost. This review is the last act of the Petersburg season, as the Court will shortly be dispersed. The Empress starts in a few days for Germany, and the Emperor will soon follow her. The Grand Duchesses will spend the summer at Tzarsko Celo, or Peterhof, and the Heir-apparent will perform a foreign tour. In Easter-week M \u2014 had an interview at the palace with the Empress, who gave her, by appointment, a private audi ence, receiving her with great kindness and affability, and with a flattering recollection of former days at Berlin. A few days ago we both had the honour of a short conversation with Her Majesty, who met us casually in the Public Gardens, where she was walking with the Grand Duchess Mary. Re cognizing M \u2014 , she stopped and accosted her, and she then addressed me in English, talking to us very graciously for a few minutes, until a small crowd of observers gathered near, when the Empress proceeded quietly on her walk. * The Russian peasant drives his horse in a tilega, but seldom rides him. Few Russian gentlemen ride for pleasure in private life, and many a cavalry officer never mounts a horse excepting in the riding-school or on duty. It would, therefore, hardly be expected that the Russian cavalry should as a body be first-rate horsemen, and this impression is quite correct as far as my observation goes. A civilian's opinion upon military matters is perhaps of little value, but most Englishmen have some eye for a good seat on a horse, and neither officer nor private here seems, as a rule, to possess it, if one may judge from seeing cavalry regiments march. The Cossacks, it must be owned, ride fearlessly and well."], [221, "Let. XXV.] OPENING OF THE NAVIGATION. 197 LETTER XXV.

One of them had been due ten days, but had been unable to make its way earlier through the ice. However, as the navigation of the Gulf of Finland is at last open, I presume we may consider the winter as fairly at an end, in spite of the Ladoga ice,* which still continues at in tervals to float thickly past. Great numbers of people have been long waiting with impatience to commence a summer trip abroad in search of health or pleasure ; and the two steamboats, which will sail for Lubeck to-morrow and the next day, will be crowded with passengers. We had intended to be among the number ; but our friend Mr. Law is going to England with some of his family for a few months, and he is anxious to lose no part of the short summer, as he must return not later than September. We have therefore given up the berths which we had engaged, and I have undertaken to act for a few weeks as chaplain at Petersburg, in his place, until the arrival of the representative he had provided. The latter, by a singular chance, happens to be no other than my oldest and most intimate friend, who is detained in England by business, and cannot arrive here until the middle of July.

We shall therefore almost imagine ourselves in England ; though, indeed, during our whole stay at Petersburg we have enjoyed much English society. I have not dwelt upon this subject in my letters, because you naturally want to hear, not about English people, but about Russia and the Russians ; and there is no great difference between our countrymen abroad and our country Tnen at home in their customs and ideas. You will readily believe the pleasure and enjoyment which the free use of the Factory library has afforded us during our residence in this city. We have been kindly permitted to carry away any books we chose, and to read them at home ; while every variety of literature, from a periodical to a book of reference, finds a place on those well-filled shelves. The English Factory is virtually independent of the censorship, as the government liberally allows them to receive from England and to place in their library any books they please, on the understanding that these unexamined works shall circulate among the English only, and not among their Russian friends. Among the objects of interest which we have lately been visiting are the Public Library of Petersburg, and the Academy of Fine Arts, of which M \u2014 _ uncle, Mr. Olenine,* is presi dent. He is one of the most distinguished literary men in Russia ; was private secretary to the late Emperor, and has been for many years high in office. His house is well known to most foreigners who have visited St. Petersburg ; and we have spent in it many of the most agreeable hours we have passed during our stay here. The object of greatest interest in the exhibition of the Academy at present is a large historical picture by the Russian painter Brilloff. The subject is the destruction of Pompeii, and the picture was painted in Italy. It was pre sented to the Academy by M. Demideff, who is said to have purchased it from the artist for thirty-five thousand * Tradition says that this family came orignally from Ireland, and they themselves suppose the name to be a corruption of O'Neill.

XXV.] ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS. 199 roubles, about fifteen hundred pounds. The general effect of this picture on the eye, at a first glance, is disagreeable, from the nature of the subject, and from the glare of colouring which belongs to such a scene. The hot falling cinders have the appearance of a shower of blood. The conception of the picture, however, shows no ordinary genius ; and the expres sions and attitudes of the figures and faces are beautifully imagined and admirably painted. The most striking figures are'those of an old man borne in the arms of his son, and of a woman stretched dead or dying in the foreground, with black hair streaming on the pavement. She has apparently been thrown out of a chariot, of which the axle is broken, and the horses are rushing wildly away in terror. Next to these is a family group, including a mother with an infant in her arms, unconscious of the danger, and stretching out its hands to catch a small bird which is fluttering on the ground. Lastly, at the left side of the picture appears a group of Christians, as is evident from a cross hung round the neck of one of them. Their resigned, though awe-struck faces, and their attitudes of prayer, are finely contrasted with the terror and despair expressed on the faces and forms of those surrounding them. The portrait of Brilloff himself is to be seen behind the Christians in the person of a man who carries the implements of a painter on his head. The architectural parts of this picture are not so well drawn as the figures. At the right hand there are three statues, intended to be tottering on the parapet of a high building, but which look rather as if they were preparing to make a volun tary plunge into the midst of the crowd below. In walking through the rooms of the Academy we found a young artist copying a picture, the details of which, it being a battle-piece, he was extremely courteous in explaining, as well as in answering other questions. We found afterwards that he was a son of the famous Kotzebue, who was sent to Siberia (by mistake') by the Emperor Paul. As I am now on the subject of works of art, I may men tion, though they have nothing to do with the Academy, the productions of the Imperial manufactory of tapestry- in Petersburg. It is on the plan of the Gobelins at Paris, and is now in full operation, preparing carpets and hangings for"], [224, "[Let. XXV. 200 MALACHITE TEMPLE. the new Winter Palace. The carpets are exceedingly rich and splendid, chiefly in the French style. The tapestry, how ever, is a more interesting work, and it is exceedingly beauti ful. One or two pictures which have been copied, or are now in progress, have quite the effect of paintings at a little distance. The best of those which we saw is a picture of Alexander the Great, receiving the family of Darius. Another splendid work of art which we have lately seen is a miniature temple destined to be placed in the church of St. Isaac, and in the mean time standing for safety in the large hall of the Tauride, which serves at present as a receptacle for the furniture saved from the Winter Palace. This shrine or temple consists of a dome seven feet in diameter, supported on eight Corinthian pillars about eight feet high. The exterior of the dome is covered with a profusion of gilding on a ground ot malachite, and the interior is of lapis lazuli. The pillars are of malachite, with gilt bases and capitals, and the floor is of polished stone of various colours ; the whole being raised on steps of polished porphyry. There is, perhaps, too much gild ing about this very beautiful work, but this is much in accord ance with its destined position in a Greek church. It was presented to the Emperor by M. Demideff, who procured the malachite from his mines in Siberia, and who sent it to Italy to be worked. Malachite is, as you probably are aware, a stone peculiar to the copper-mines of Siberia. It is of the colour of verdigris marbled, and bears evident marks of having once been in a state of fusion. It can only be obtained in small pieces, so that all malachite work, however solid it may appear, is a species of mosaic formed of innumerable fragments of irregular shape. In the visit of which I have spoken to the Public Library, I was chiefly interested by the collection of MSS. ; some of the most remarkable of which were pointed out to me by Mr. Atkinson, the librarian, who was kind enough to accompany me over the whole Institution. The library contains about four hundred thousand volumes, a considerable part of which were acquired by right of might, having been transferred to Petersburg from the Public Library at Warsaw. There are about forty thousand volumes of MSS."], [225, "Let. XXV.] AUTOGRAPHS OF MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS. 201 Among those which I examined is a missal which was pur chased in France, and which formerly belonged to Mary Queen of Scots. It is quite perfect, except that in the illuminations with which it is abundantly ornamented there have once been numerous coats of arms, every one of which, from the beginning of the book to the end, has been carefully erased, and the shield left vacant. It is difficult to guess with what object this has been done, as no other mutilation is apparent. The chief interest of this missal lies in numerous scraps of the Queen's hand-writing which are to be found in it, breathing in general a melancholy spirit in accordance with her unhappy fortunes. It must be owned that much cannot be said in favour of her poetry, the exact meaning of which is not always very clear. Near the beginning is written across the bottom of two pages, Ce Hvre est a moi, Marie reyne, 1553,* doubtless an autograph. In another page are written the following lines in the Queen's hand : \u2014 Un c\u0153ur que Voutrage martire, Par un mepris ou d'un res as, A le pouvoir de faire dire, Je ne suis pas ce que ie sus.

In another place, in the same writing, are these verses : \u2014 - Qui idmais davantage eust contraire le sort, Si la vie m'est moi)is utile que le mart, Et plus tost que chagerf de ines niaus V 'adventure, Chacun change pour moi d'humeur et de nature.

Below these lines the Queen has scrawled a memorandum, \" escrire au Secretare pour Douglas.\" I was afterwards shown, in a collection of original letters, one from Mary to the King of France, written during her imprisonment, in which, addressing the King as Monsieur mon Frere, and signing herself votre bonne s\u0153ur Marie, she speaks of Douglas, recommending him to the future favour of his most Christian Majesty, whom she at the same time thanks for his attention to her former request in behalf of the same person.

Among others is Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, in whose hand are two or three letters to the King of France, expressing the deepest gratitude and devotion to his most Christian Majesty, and entreating for a continuance of his favour. I am afraid Queen Elizabeth would not have been altogether pleased with the tone of these epistles. Among the \u25a0most interesting letters was a long one dated at St. Germains, from Henrietta, Queen of Charles the First, to the Sieur Grig non, begging him, if possible, to procure from the Speakers of the two Houses and tfie General a pass for herself and her attend ants, to enable her to visit her husband in England, and to remain with him as long as can be permitted. The Queen expresses her fears that this pass will be refused, but she reminds the Sieur Grignon how much she has the object at heart, and assures him of her eternal gratitude if he succeeds. She then offers to make out, for the inspection of the Speakers and the General, a list of the attendants whom she proposes to bring with her, in order that the name of any person to whom they object may be omitted in the pass. With these short extracts I will conclude my letter ; nor will I detail to you an expedition which we made lately by the railroad with some Russian friends to Tzarsko Celo, where we saw all that is to be seen \u2014 the armoury, which is well arranged ; the park, which boasts of no fine trees ; and the palace itself, which is magnificent. The saloon, the walls of which are entirely encrusted with amber, is celebrated, and is not only curious but beautiful. The floors throughout the palace are exquisite ; nor am I sure that a famous parquet, which is ornamented by inlaid bouquets of mother-of-pearl, was the one I most admired. One room has a most singular appearance, from the walls being entirely covered to a certain depth with paintings of all sizes, unframed and fitted into one another like a puzzle ; the variety of size and colouring of the paintings giving to the whole an appearance of patchwork.

Upon this a number of the young men, seventeen or eighteen years old, assembled round the President's house, breaking windows, and committing a great riot. This insubordination obviously required severe repression, but, instead of ex pelling the offenders, or inflicting such other punishment as our ideas would suggest, the authorities have treated the affair as a political demon stration; and some twenty of these unfortunate lads, all sons of gentlemen of good family, have been sentenced to the ranks of the army as common soldiers.

I should be extremely ungrateful were I not to acknowledge the very great kindness and hospitality which were shown to us by those whom it was the immediate object of our journey to visit, and which I often felt exceeded our natural claim upon them as relatives and foreigners. We also everywhere met with much attention and civility from those strangers with whom we became acquainted. In the following remarks I shall endeavour carefully to"], [229, "EDUCATION OF BOYS. 205 avoid all points which might affect private feelings, should this book ever fall into the hands of any Russian friend. To begin with the subject of education. Nothing, accord ing to my ideas, can be much worse than the system usually pursued with Russian boys. The commencement of their education is often so long deferred, that their minds are unopened from want of employment ; and the boys generally remain much too long under female government, often until they are thirteen, or even fifteen years old ; the whole system of management tending to check the gradual growth of manly ideas. The discipline at all the public institutions or academies is military, whether the pupils are intended for the army or for civil professions ; while, if the boy is brought up at home, the usual system in Russia with those who can afford the expense of private tutors, he is not sufficiently thrown on his own resources or accustomed to act for himself. As to the acquirements which a Russian education professes to bestow, a knowledge of French, and, to a certain extent, of German, and a little history, geography, and arithmetic, form pretty nearly the sum total. French, indeed, is learned and spoken from the cradle, and children often know it as well as their mother tongue : the knowledge, however, of these languages is seldom followed up by much acquaintance with their literature. To French and German, English is sometimes added. The preceptors who are engaged in the houses of Russian gentlemen are almost invariably foreigners, and their time is chiefly occupied in teaching modern lan guages ; a classical education being nearly unheard of. The Russian boy is little accustomed to hardy and manly amusements. Athletic games appear to be almost unknown to him, and he seldom mounts a horse till he is grown up, or nearly so, when he learns to ride, if he learns at all, in a riding-school. The Russians dine early, and their children, even from the age of two or three years,* almost invariably dine with them ; the * The young children are attended by nurses, who never appear to leave them for a moment.

What is much worse for them, however, is the con versation to which they listen at table. The parents may take care to avoid all topics which are unsuited to the ears of chil dren, but they cannot exercise a similar control over their guests, who make remarks upon the conduct of their neigh bours, and discuss the usual subjects of gossip and scandal, without much attention to the moral lessons which they may be givins: to the children at table with them. O _> In most countries every one has a general idea of his neigh bour's fortune ; but in Russia, where the fortunes consist in slaves, the number of which on each estate is registered, the calculations can be made with great nicety ; and every child knows, from a veiy early age, how many peasants his father has, and how many of them will fall to his own share. At the age of eighteen or nineteen the young Russian, in the majority of cases, enters the army, and from the moment he is fairly embarked in the seivice he is harassed and fatigued to death with drilling and exercising from morning till night. He has scarcely a leisure moment for improving his mind, should he wish to do so, and he perhaps spends the best years of his life in the banishment of a wretched country village, with no society but that of a few comrades, whose ideas do not extend far beyond the pleasures of drinking and smoking. The ladies in Russia are, generally speaking, very superior, both in acquirements and manners, to the gentlemen. The system of private education, so disadvantageous to boys, is suitable and proper for girls ; and as the latter have no mili tary service to put an end to improvement, and to exclude them from good society on their entrance into life, their minds are usually better cultivated than those of the young men, and their manners are more refined. There is, however, an important event which not unfre quently operates as effectually to stop the education of the young ladies, as does the commencement of a military career in the other sex. I allude to the early marriages, which, as I have observed, are often arranged by parents without con-"], [231, "THE SERVANTS. 207 suiting the inclinations of the parties most concerned. A girl is sometimes married at sixteen, and often at seventeen, from which time the cares of a family naturally begin to fall upon her, and in the generality of cases to supersede the practice of her accomplishments or the inq.rovement of her mind. It may be thought that this misfortune is not peculiar to Russia, but I have already mentioned * the number and variety of domestic duties which usually devolve on the mistress of a family in Russia ; and it must be observed that little confi dence can in general be placed in the servants. Being slaves, they have only to avoid absolute punishment, and have little inducement to exert themselves. They have no places to lose by misconduct, no advantageous situations to gain by a good character. Their master is bound to support them whether they are indolent or active, sulky or obliging ; and though they may be lazy, dirty, and awkward, he cannot exchange them for the better. The servants themselves well know that this is the case, and therefore the generality of them only try to perform their service with as little trouble to themselves as possible. They have not much work to do, for three or four Russian servants are employed where one would suffice in England, and they spend half their time in sleeping or in playing cards. Sleep, especially, never appears to come amiss to them ; they can enjoy it anywhere or in any position, and they would cer tainly join most cordially with Sancho Panza in the blessings which he invoked on its inventor. It is, nevertheless, the domestic servants who chiefly feel the weight of slavery, since they are always under the master's eye, and are neces sarily- subject to a more galling surveillance than the ordinary serfs ; they also do not so readily obtain permission to marry, since too rapid an increase to the household numbers is by no means convenient or profitable to the master. The priests, and still more the Bishops, in Russia seem to be in a false social position ; their hands are kissed, their blessing is asked, and they are treated with a vast deal of outward ceremony, but at the same time their influence is but small, and even the highest dignitaries appear to possess little * See the conclusion of Letter XI."], [232, "THE GREEK CHURCH. 208 real weight or consideration. This probably arises from the poverty and inferior station of the clergy, whose condition and mode of life is often but little above that of the peasant. The clergy are also'very much a class apart, the son generally following the profession of his father, and priests' daughters intermarrying chiefly with priests. In most towns there are ecclesiastical seminaries for the gratuitous education of their sons. None but monks, as I have before mentioned, can be- come bishops. In the Greek church there are four great fasts in the year, namely : \u2014 1. Lent, which lasts six weeks, commencing on the Monday before Ash-Wednesday ; the preceding week, moreover, being to a certain degree a fast. 2. A fast in June, which varies in duration from a fortnight to a month. .3. A fast from the 1st to the 14th of August. 4. A fast during the six weeks preceding Christmas. In addition to these periods, Wednesdays and Fridays are fast-days all the year round, as are also the eves of certain saints' days. No marriages can be performed on a Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday ; nor during any of the great fasts ; nor during Easter week, or the w-eek preceding Lent. The Greek church disapproves of celibacy in the clergy, but no ecclesiastic can enter into a second marriage. The language of Divine service in the church is not Russian, but Sclavonic, which is by no means universally understood. No restriction is placed on the use of the Bible. In the ad ministration of the Communion to the laity the bread is dipped in the wine and given with a spoon, the priests and the Em peror alone receiving the elements separately. Russians are fond of 'boasting of their national tolera tion in all religious matters ; and in conversation they fre quently carry this principle to an extreme, since I have often heard \"them remark, What does it matter whether we are Greeks or Protestants ? we are all equally Christians. This ultra-liberalism, however, is but a loose way of talking, and it is limited to mere words, for the toleration which actually prevails in no way corresponds to it. Religion, it is true, does"], [233, "PETERSBURG NOT RUSSIA. 209 not legally disqualify a man from holding any office ; but, nevertheless, no marriage can be celebrated between a Russian subject of the Established Church and a person of any other religion, until an undertaking has been signed by the dissent ing party, whether it be the husband or the wife, that all the issue of the marriage shall be brought up in the Greek faith. This law almost amounts to a prohibition of such unions, and it is utterly inconsistent with the pretence of religious equality for all churches, and toleration for all creeds. Foreigners in Russia are commonly told \" Petersburg is not Russia : if you wish to see Russians as they really are, you must look for them at Moscow, or in the interior of the coun try.\" This often repeated phrase undoubtedly contains much truth ; for the strong admixture of strangers in the population of Petersburg must produce a great effect on the habits of the place. The whole number of inhabitants is about four hun dred thousand, and of these no less than sixty thousand are Germans ; subjects, it is true, for the most part, of the Emperor, but still perfectly distinct in language, habits, and religious opinions from the Russians. Of English residents there are about two thousand, and the' number of French is very con siderable. Petersburg, moreover, is not only the capital of the empire, and therefore the centre of wealth and of luxury, the spot where civilization proceeds most rapidly, and where changes first appear ; but it is also what it is often called, namely-, the window through which Russia looks at Europe. It may be added, it is also the door by which Europe and European ideas and habits enter Russia. For these reasons it is even more necessary in this than in other countries for those who wish to learn the national character, and to witness national customs, to seek them in the interior, and not in the capital. The Russian peasant is rude and ignorant, but he is endowed with a high degree of natural shrewdness and ingenuity, and I have more than once had occasion to admire, not only his readiness to give assistance in a difficulty,* but also his handy * Yet, owing to an apparently absurd police regulation at Petersburg, and also at Moscow, if a person breaks his leg in the street, or meets with any other accident, no one, as I am assured, will give him a helping hand, or render the slightest aid, till the police arrive.

Good humour, and a gay obliging disposition, are among the leading traits of his character ; while his aptitude to acquire any art, and his genius for imitation, are sufficiently attested by the manufactories which are carried on in every part of tbe country by the hands of the peasants born on the spot. Like all uncivilized men, the Russian peasant is inclined to pilfer - but open robbery or acts of violence are very rare, and one may travel unarmed in perfect security through the empire. The ordinary Russian tradesman is apt to be mean, dishonest, and tricky, asking for his goods twice what he eventually takes, and whenever it is possible imposing an inferior articlo on his customer, trying to make the most at present, instead of tempting the purchaser, by fair dealing, to return another time to his shop. A spirit of trade runs through all ranks of the community. The peasant is forced to be a trader, because he is paid for his labour in land, of which he must sell, to the best advantage, the superfluous produce. The class above the peasant consists of traders by profession ; and the noble endea vours to increase his fortune, and to make up for the small returns of his land, b3^ establishing the rural manufactories of which I have often spoken. It is difficult to perceive how Russia, under her present cir cumstances, can advance much further in civilization. Her iron despotism, her superstition, and her system of slavery are suited only to a state of darkness and semibarbarism among the mass of the people. Yet it is hardly to be desired that they should emerge from this condition, since with light would of necessity arise a keener perception of grievances and a thirst for change ; while it seems impossible that the country should attain to the blessings of freedom and of liberal institutions without passing through the ordeal of a fierce and bloody revolution. If the present order of things were once shaken, it must be very long before the government of the empire and before public credit could be re-established on a firm and stable footing. In fact, Russia appears to contain no elements for a free government on sound principles, and a revolution would be likely to produce nothing but a state of anarchy and con fusion, such as that of the South American Republics. There"], [235, "WANT OF INDEPENDENCE. 211 is no independent class in the country, unless the traders may be so considered ; but they are uneducated, narrow-minded, and superstitious in the extreme ; and they form, moreover, numerically, but a very small proportion of the community. Influence or authority, not conferred by the Emperor's com mission, is an idea which few Russians at all comprehend ; the empire is indeed but a vast army, of which the Emperor is General-in-Chief, unless, parvis componere magna, it be regarded as a great school, of which he is Head Master. This indeed, though the comparison may not be very dignified, is really much the light in which his Imperial Majesty appears to be regarded in his dominions. \"Wherever he is expected to pass, institutions are put in order, roads are repaired, and bridges mended, on which the rest of the world might have broken their necks unnoticed. In short, the same sort of effect is produced as that which, in a school-room, generally follows the intimation that \" is coming!\" when noise ceases, books are opened, every one slips quietly into his place, en deavouring to look as if he had never been out of it, and the most disorderly are of course most careful to put on a studious and attentive demeanour. In Russia, where public opinion is almost unknown, public spirit cannot be expected to show itself on ordinary occasions, though that it does exist, and that it only requires circumstances to call it into play, was sufficiently proved at the period of the French invasion. Functionaries, therefore, of all classes, military and civil, high and low, must generally be expected to act, not so much with a view to the public good, or even to the attainment of popularity and reputation, as with the object of attracting the favourable notice of the Emperor, the only source of honour, promotion, and reward. The Government perpetually betrays an apprehension of revolt and conspiracy, which would seem to show that the basis is not felt to be very secure on which the internal peace and tranquillity of the empire rest. I have heard it asserted, on good authority, that some time ago four general officers, namely, Marshal JIarmont in France, the Archduke Ferdinand in Austria, General Wrede in Ba varia, and the Duke of Wellington in England, were requested p 2"], [236, "ELEMENTS OF REVOLUTION. 212 to furnish to their respective Governments their opinions as to the power of Russia, offensive and defensive, as invading Europe or resisting invasion at home. The opinions of these four distinguished personages were unanimous, to the effect that Russia as an invader would be weak, from the impossi bility of organizing a sufficient commissariat, or of maintaining her troops when beyond her own territory ; but that, on the other hand, if invaded, she would be impregnable, from her immense extent of frontier, and from the very large bodies of men which she could immediately oppose to the invaders at whatever point the attack were made, her climate being also an insurmountable obstacle.* To return from this digression : it is not surprising that the Russian Government should be apprehensive of political dis turbances, for the country has a formidable body of natural enemies to the present order of things in her twenty-two millions of male serfs, who are indeed, at present, exceedingly tranquil, like the contents of a well-guarded powder-magazine, but who may some day, by a sudden explosion, overthrow the empire. Nor are there wanting those who would willingly seize an opportunity to fire the train. There are discontented nobles to raise the standard of rebellion, and there are secta rians as well inclined to subvert the established government as the established religion. Let these at a favourable moment proclaim freedom to the serfs, and it is hardly to be expected that they will refuse the offer. The Russian peasant is too unenlightened to appreciate the real blessings of liberty, but he would readily comprehend the advantage of not being com pelled to labour three days in the week for his master ; al though, in point of fact, by so doing, he merely pays the rent of the land which he occupies himself. Great, however, as this temptation would be, a greater still might be held out to him in a release from the terrors of the conscription, which is, in truth, the most pressing evil of his lot, and the one most dreaded by him. It is to him what, according to the old Scotch superstition, * These opinions obviously apply to an inland invasion like that of the French in 1812, not to operations supported by the command of the sea, like those of the allied armies in the Crimea in 1854 and 1805."], [237, "ITS NATURAL RESULTS. 213 \" the teind to hell\" was to the fairies ; and as, in their case, the victim was \" fat and fair of flesh,\" so the conscript must be young, strong, and healthy, and, in short, one of the most able and useful members of his family. Every domestic tie is severed, even in time of peace, for him who becomes a Russian soldier. His home is lost ; his wife is a widow ; his children are orphans ; his parents are childless as much as if he were dead ; and he himself is twice as much a slave as he was be fore. The Emperor is become his master ; and when he is enlisted, he knows not where or what his service will be \u2014 whether by sea or by land \u2014 whether that of a soldier or of a sailor. The generality, it is true, of the recruits soon become reconciled to their lot, for their disposition is easy, and, being fatalists, they consider that they are only fulfilling their des tiny. Nevertheless, the diseases which they counterfeit,* and still more, the mutilations which they often inflict upon themselves, in the hope of being thus incapacitated for the ser vice, prove their dread of being forced into it. Should any inducements be successful in exciting the people to revolt, the first result of the overthrow of the present order of things would undoubtedly be a reign of terror, in the mas sacres and other acts of violence which must be expected from a population in the depths of ignorance, suddenly freed, not only from their fetters, but from the ordinary restraints of law and subordination. Their worst passions would naturally be roused against their late masters, whom they would be taught to regard as their enemies and oppressors. A man's foes would truly be those of his own household ; for the domestic servants suffer naturally more than the peasants from the authority of a good master and the tyranny of a bad one. They would consider that they had the most injuries to avenge, and their vengeance would be the most terrible. The consequences which might be looked for if the slaves rose against their mas ters, and the soldiers against their officers, may be judged of * This is a very common plan with the conscripts : they pretend to be subject to fits, and counterfeit other attacks, the existence of which is not easily disproved; and men have been known to chop off their fingers with an axe, and even to inflict upon themselves still more dreadful mutilations, in order to escape the conscription."], [238, "RESULTS OF REVOLUTION. 214 by the revolt of the military colonies which took place soon after the accession of the present Emperor, and which was repressed entirely by his personal intrepidity in proceeding immediately to the spot, appearing unguarded amongst the rioters, and asserting his authority at the risk of his life. On that occasion no atrocity was omitted, and the unhappy officers who had incurred the fury of their men were not merely mur dered, but tortured with the utmost barbarity. After the murders and acts of violence which must be ex pected, the next result to be apprehended from a revolution in Russia w-ould be a fearful and general famine ; for utter im providence is one leading characteristic of the peasant, and, if he found himself suddenly relieved from the obligation of working for his master, he probably would have little fore thought for himself. At any rate, during the period of the convulsion, the land of the master would be uncultivated, and half the country would be unproductive ; the other half being, to say the least, very generally neglected. This evil would, of course, be remedied by time ; the proprietors would, as in other countries, employ hired labourers for the cultivation of their land ; and the peasant would learn that, whether slave or freeman, he must equally earn his bread by the sweat of his brow. Before, however, the period of re-action came, multitudes must have perished from the neglect of husbandry, and from the conse quent deficiency of crops, even if it were but for one season. Russia has no external resources, she depends entirely upon her self to supply food for her population, and, if that supply were to fail, the population must perish for want. On the whole, odious and bad as the present Government and system of things in Russia is, and iron as is the despotism which prevails, the country, it must be allow-ed, is morally unfitted for liberal institutions. Were this doubtful, the cha racter of the different conspiracies which have been brought to light would be sufficient to prove the fact. These have always either commenced or been intended to commence by murder and bloodshed ; and it has never appeared that those engaged in revolutionary projects had any rational or feasible system of Government to propose, if they had succeeded in overthrowing"], [239, "CHARACTER OF THE EMPEROR. 215 the ruling powers. Were it practicable, therefore, to bring about a revolution, it would be doing certain evil without any assur ance of future good ; \u2014 the prospect on the one hand of advantage being very remote and doubtful, and the evils on the other hand to be incurred most imminent and dreadful. This view of tilings will not justify, but it, may serve to explain, the uniform and inexorable severity of the Emperor Nicholas to political offenders, while to ordinary criminals he often shows an undue degree of indulgence and leniency. He has laid it down as a fixed and fundamental principle, to allow of no political changes, and to suffer no political agitation, in his dominions ; and for the maintenance of this principle he is utterly regard less of the amount of individual suffering he may inflict. Polish convicts especially are often treated with the grossest and most wanton cruelty. I was told by a person on whose authority I could rely, that a party of Polish Roman Catholic priests, con demned to Siberia, had been compelled to travel for some dis tance on foot, chained together, and with their arms fixed to bars and stretched out as though on a cross. Such tyranny however is probably not to be attributed to the Emperor himself. It is the result of the ancient and undying antipathy which exists between the Russian and the Pole, and which is on both sides inconceivably bitter and inveterate. Ambitious and despotic as the Emperor Nicholas is, when any calamity occurs he is always foremost in aiding the sufferers. He is very affection ate in his own family, and it is evident that he has no personal fear of his subjects. He constantly shows himself without guard or escort ; and when he is at Petersburg he appears daily in the streets wrapped in his cloak and seated in a small one horse sledge, or in a low open carriage and pair, with no servant or attendant but the coachman. No sovereign therefore can seem to exhibit a more entire confidence than Nicholas does in the personal attachment of his people. His real strength lies in the devotion of the peasantry and in the fear of the nobles, and he trusts in his own prestige, which never yet has failed him."], [240, ""], [241, "217 DETAILS OF RUSSIAN HUSBANDRY AND RURAL ECONOMY, IN A LETTER FROM MR. SABOUROFF, OF TAMBOFF. Mr. Saboueoff is a landed gentleman whose estate lies in the Government of Tamboff.

One day he said to me, after we had been talking on the subject: \u2014 \" You appear to take a considerable interest in these matters, and if you like I will put on paper a few remarks, which may give you a general idea of our mode of managing our estates, and of our system of agriculture.\" I thanked Mr. Sabouroff for this kind offer, which I gladly accepted, and the day that I quitted Tamboff, on taking leave of me, he presented me with the promised paper, in the form of a letter, of which the following is a translation. Being from the pen of a Russian country gentleman, it may be relied on as giving an authentic account of the position and revenues of the landed proprietor, and of the condition and occupations of the peasant. Letter from Mr. Sabouroff. Tamboff, February 14th (O.S.), 18S8. You have paid me the compliment of applying to me for some information on the subject of our rural economy, and it"], [242, "218 DETAILS OF HUSBANDRY is with the greatest pleasure that I sit down to furnish you with it to the best of my ability. As a resident landed pro prietor, I am not unacquainted with the subject on which I now enter, first bespeaking your indulgence for a composition which is not written in my native tongue.* I think the end in view will be best answered by a, sum mary description of an estate of moderate size, with all the details of its cultivation and general management. Knowing one, you will know all, for in our system of husbandry there is little variety. From habit and circumstances we follow a general routine, the exceptions to which are rare, and attri butable rather to the fancies of individual proprietors than to any other cause. We value our estates by the number of souls upon them, taking into account the male serfs only. This is an ancient custom, derived from the old times, when our revenues de pended upon the number of hands at our disposal. At present the case is changed ; the land is the source of our profits, while our serfs are often a dead weight upon us, \u2014 the more so, that they stand by no means on the footing of the Roman slaves, but they are possessed of lights, some established by law, and more by custom. The law places at their disposal three of the working days of every week, and Sundays and holidays in addition. Their master is obliged to supply them with food and the other necessaries of life ; and if the serf becomes a beggar, the master is liable to a fine. The custom of the country is to allot to the peasants the half of the land which belongs to the owner of the estate ; to defend them, against all aggression and ill-treatment at the hands of strangers ; and strictly to respect their property. The exceptions to this conduct are rare, and, when they occur, are quoted with indignation and pointed to with contempt ; so that on this point public opinion supplies the place of law. We have even, from a regard to their feelings, adopted for our peasants the very appellation, viz. that of Christians, which they have given themselves. * The letter was written in French, but this apology was very unneces sary, Mr. Sabouroff being as much at home in that language as in the rural economy of his native country."], [243, "AND RURAL ECONOMY. 219 With these means and this order of things our peasant is by no means in a bad condition. His habits and desires are, owing to his w-ant of civilization, simple in the extreme. But were his wishes enlarged, he could easily gratify them ; land, and the time to cultivate it, being at his disposal. Our peasant works hard, sleeps but little, is satisfied with the coarsest food, and is by no means an habitual drunkard, though he now and then breaks the monotony of his existence by a fit of brutal in toxication. But even in this state his natural good humour shows itself. The quarrels which these occasional revels produce, though noisy enough, never lead to blood-shedding. Of this, indeed, the Russian peasant has a horror, and murders are ex tremely rare. Let him be oppressed, and he will contrive to revenge himself by a short but biting sarcasm. He is deeply imbued with a reverence for religion, and is not so much superstitious as thoroughly ignorant. He kisses the hand of his parish priest, but he laughs at his failings, and is quite able to make the distinction between the individual and the office. Of this I can give you a very characteristic anecdote. Passing one day near a large group of peasants who were assembled in the middle of the village, I asked them what was going forward. \"We are only putting the Father (as they call the priest) into a cellar.\" \" Into a cellar,\" I replied; \" what are you doing that for?\" \" Oh,\" said they, \" he is a sad drunkard, and is in a state of intoxication all the week. So we always take care, every Satuiday, to put him in a safe place, that he may be fit to officiate at church next day ; and on Monday he is at liberty to begin drinking again.\" I could not help applauding this very sensible arrangement, which was related to me with all the gravity in the world. But to return to our system of husbandry, of which I think I have explained the character of the principal elements, viz. the tillers of the soil, who are by no means the mere machines which they are commonly supposed to be. To govern them, a little order in the arrangements, a certain degree of tact, and, above all, impartial justice, are the chief requisites. A village of two hundred souls (j. e. male peasants of all"], [244, "DETAILS OF HUSBANDRY 220 ages) possesses usually two thousand acres of productive land. The crown, or imperial acre, which is employed in all public transactions, contains two thousand four hundred square sa gines,* or thirteen thousand and sixty-six square yards. The common acre, which, as more convenient, is in ordinary use, contains three thousand two hundred square sagines, or seven teen thousand four hundred and twenty-two square yards. Two hundred' souls are usually reckoned to furnish eighty labourers, women and men, for the wives f toil as well as their husbands. These work three days in the week for their master, who gives up to them, in return, the half of his land. The system of agriculture is triennial, with fallows ; that is to say, the land bears two crops in three years. Each married couple receives two acres in each of the three portions ; _'. e. winter corn, spring crop, and fallow, into which, by this system, the arable land is divided ; so that they have in all six acres, in addition to an acre of meadow and an acre of pasture. Besides this, they have the ground for a house, garden, and out buildings ; and, by way of rent for their allotment, the peasant and his wife are required to cultivate as much for their master as they occupy themselves. The quantity of land thus appor tioned to each peasant would appear enormous in any other country of Europe ; but with us it is not too much, for we do not manure our land, J and our only agricultural instruments consist in a very light plough and a wooden harrow, either of them drawn with ease by a single horse. The fine season being very short, the operations of husbandry are perforated with surprising activity. The \\-ast tracts covered by abundant crops are quickly bared, and the produce is heaped up in open barns. In winter, the grain, consisting of rye (the staple food of the country), wheat, barley, oats, pease, millet, and buckwheat, is threshed, usually with the flail, but sometimes with a Scotch threshing machine ; and it is then transported into the towns, * 1 sagine = 9 feet; and therefore, as the statute acre = 4S40 yards or 43,560 feet,\u2014 1 Imperial acre (Russian) = 2*7 statute acres nearly. 1 Common acre (Russian\") = 3-7 statute acres nearly. t Possessing bodies, though not counted as souls. j That is to say, in the Government of Tamboff, and some other southern districts. In Russia, in general, manure is highly necessary."], [245, "AND RURAL ECONOMY. 221 sometimes to a distance of one or two hundred versts. The straw is consumed by the cattle, and is also used in the steppes, where wood is scarce, for heating the stoves. There is, how ever, often a surplus, which is employed to make fences for gardens, or embankments for ponds and marshes. Our roads and highways not being stoned, the immense transports of produce can, generally speaking, only be made in winter on sledges. If the transport ever takes place in summer, it is effected by means of oxen, the keep of which costs nothing, since the road itself supplies them with pasture ; for it is no less than two hundred and ten feet, or thirty sagines, wide, and all as green as a meadow. These oxen, which are seldom employed in tilling the land, but always in transporting goods, come to us from the vast steppes of the Volga and the Don, and from the Caucasus ; and this periodical influx of horned beasts, which are brought in great numbers from all the confines of the empire, is the source of frequent plagues and distempers, which destroy our cattle and frustrate all our endeavours to improve the breed. Some amateur agriculturists of large fortune possess fine cattle, imported at a great expense from England and Holland ; but all the profit, hitherto at least, has been absorbed by the expense and precautions * necessary for the jireservation of these animals \u2014 precautions indeed which, for the generality of proprietors, and still more for the peasants, are totally out of the question. This is the reason why, with our fine pastures and apparently w-ith all the means of having an excellent breed of horned cattle, we have nothing but poor and miserable animals. With Merino sheep the case is very dif ferent ; our wools, indeed, are not first-rate, because at present quantity is found more profitable than quality, and our cloth factories are not yet adapted for manufacturing the fine sorts of wool. The consequence is, that, while coarse wool affords to the grower an immense profit, fine wool fetches less than prime cost, and the owners of flocks of superior breeds are only paid by the sale of rams. This is an excellent state of things for extending the Merino blood and improving the breed of * Precautions, that is to say, against the effects of the Russian climate, to which they are not mortgagee."], [246, "DETAILS OF HUSBANDRY 222 sheep by degrees. The ram trade is at present a very flourishing business. Now as to our horses, we must divide them into two classes \u2014 those of the gentry and those of the peasants. The gentry occupy themselves zealously and successfully with their breed ing studs, upon which they spare neither expense nor trouble. The studs of the province of Tamboff are chiefly supplied by the fine stallions bred by Countess Orloff. The grand object is to produce fine powerful trotters, and in this we meet with great success. With the peasants' horses the case is quite dif ferent. They are small, of a bad breed, ill fed, and worse cared fur. There is no legislative measure in existence for their improvement ; the habits of the people in no way supply this deficiency, and the breed of horses of this description is utterly neglected, and is visibly growing worse. In this case, as in many others, our system of husbandry is passing through a crisis. Formerly the immense tracts of arable and pasture, and the superabundance of grain, permitted the keeping of great numbers of horses, half wild, but strong and hardy ; and the remains of this stock are still to be seen in the hands of our peasants. The people, however, have not yet learned to ac commodate themselves to the present, state of things, now that land is scarcer and forage dearer ; so that they ought to be more careful, and to bestow more attention on the breed and on the keep of their stock. Habit, and the recollec tion of the time when they might wander for pasture far and wide, have hitherto interfered to prevent the adoption of an improved system among our peasants; but it is to be hoped that, when the origin and progress of this evil are once fairly perceived, the landed gentry and the Government will take measures to remedy it. This is the more probable, since society in Russia was never so much occupied as at present in pro moting all kinds of industry, and everything connected with agriculture in particular. A movement has been lately pro duced which is active enough, and which may resolve itself into satisfactory results. A few ordinary sheep, pigs, poultry of all kinds, and one or two cow-s, in addition to the horse, the sorry description of which we have just lamented, complete the live stock of the"], [247, "AND RURAL ECONOMY. 223 peasant, and help to consume the produce of his land, which he cannot sell at any price, however low, on account of the distance of the markets. In a year of plenty, the different kinds of corn become exceedingly cheap, and are consumed with reckless improvidence, since no one thinks of laying by. And this will explain the terrible dearths which sometimes visit us. But we will return to this subject, and treat it more at length. These dearths arise from numerous causes. With the triennial system our manner of proceeding is very simple. In the month of August we sow our winter corn, viz. rye, and a small patch of wheat, having ploughed the ground twice in the course of the summer. In September, after the harvest, we prepare the ground for the spring by a light ploughing, and in the month of April, after a second ploughing, we sow it with oats, barley, pease, and millet, and a little later with buckwheat. In June we prepare the ground for the winter crop, and begin to mow the glass, and the corn harvest begins in the middle of July, thus completing the annual routine of our husbandly.* I must inform you that the twentieth part of our population lives in towns, and is engaged, in various trades ; the remainder is wholly agricultural. Every peasant, as you have seen above, cultivates for hiss master and himself, in addition to the fallow, eight acres of arable land, and mows two acres of meadow. Every acre in a plentiful year gives not less than ten measures called chetverts t of grain. You can judge, therefore, of the immense quantity of our produce, of which more than half remains on our hands, owing to the lowness of the price and the prodi gality of consumption. Two or three successive years of good crops overload us to the greatest possible degree. No human force can dispose of the produce, and our storehouses are not capacious enough to contain the corn ; the more so, that build ings of all kinds are very expensive with us.} The natural * It must be remembered that the seasons are reckoned in Russia according to the old style, twelve days, or nearly half a month, later than the new ; so that the hay harvest does not really begin till July, or the corn harvest till August. . , + The chetvert of rye weighs six Russian poods, or 216 lbs. As a mea sure, 1 chetvert = 5-77 imperial bushels J From the scarcity of stone and wood in this part of Russia."], [248, "DETAILS OF HUSBANDRY 224 question then is, \u2014 why do we produce' so much, and why do we not vary our productions ?\u2014 a question easy to ask, but not perhaps so easy to answer. Our peasants being once provided for by the allotment of land, being unable to read or write, and ignorant of every art but that of husbandry, time and money would be requisite to teach them and to habituate them to any other branch of industry. Now time and money are generally the very things of which landed proprietors in this country have least at their disposal. They must live, educate their children, and pay the debt to the crown.* They are always forced to dispose of their annual produce in a huny, in order to realize the necessary sum of money ; and they seldom have in any degree the means of attempting to reform their system of management. I am speaking here of people of mo derate fortune. Where the property is on a great scale, the case is often still worse, and the revenue is entirely absorbed by the luxury and expenses of the capital, without any benefit to the provinces, or to agriculture. However full of grain of all kinds our storehouses ma}- be, it is clearly impossible, as you see, to check the production. We cannot dismiss our people when we do not want them, as if the}- were hired labourers ; and in spite of the superabund ance on hand, they must continue to produce, were it only for the sake of occupation. But since our hopes rest less on our mode of cultivation than on the fertility of the soil, and the rain from heaven, \u2014 let the rain, as is not unfrequently the case, fail, or a frost in the very height of summer utterly ruin our crops ; then prices suddenly rise, and every one is in a hurry to empty his barns, and to dispose of the stock on hand. Since the case is out of the common way, no one calculates on its recurrence ; but, on the contrary, the chances are always in favour of the crop. But suppose a second year like the former, then prices become extraordinarily high, and the most prudent profit by it, and hasten to sell their produce. Under these circumstances, let there be a third year such as the two pre ceding it, and you have a complete famine, the more likely to be general, since our system of husbandry and the want of * When, as is generally the case, there is a mortgage on the estate, the Crown is the mortgagee."], [249, "AND RURAL ECONOMY. 225 variety in the produce is common to all Russia. Owing, moreover, to our total deficiency in the means of internal communication, it sometimes happens that, wliile in one part of the country there is a superabundance, another part is suffering from dearth. Our province of Tamboff is, it is true, fortunately circumstanced with respect to means of communi cation ; \u25a0 since it possesses a central port (of inland navigation), connecting it by the great navigable rivers, the Occa and the Volga, with Petersburg and Moscow. This port is Morscha, a small district town, which carries on a considerable trade, and where there is also a veiy fine flour-mill, constructed by the mechanician Ruodebort, and belonging to Count Koutaisoff. In spite, however, of these advantages, our rye almost always sells for less than five roubles (about four shillings) the chetvert or measure of two hundred and sixteen pounds, and this renders our taxes, though nominally small, extremely burdensome in reality. The tax, with us, which presses on agriculture, is purely personal. It is levied on every male once in three months ; and is paid into the chest of the govern ment of the province : the collectors being officers of the crown, elected by the nobility. There is also another local tax for the district (pour la commune) ; but these two taxes are so essentially personal, being levied on the individual, and not on the property, that there are immense fortunes belonging sometimes to nobles, but more often to traders and others not privileged to possess serfs, which absolutely pay no tax at all. This is a defect in our system, for the burden of course falls on the shoulders of the poor instead of the rich. I have told you that these taxes, though nominally small, are burdensome ; and I will show you why. A peasant's family, on an average, consists, we will suppose, of a father in the primo of life, three children, and an infirm old man ; these compose the males, and we may reckon three of the other sex. Of the whole family, the father alone is an able-bodied labourer, and the rest (since no branch of industry is exer cised in the village which is suited to their strength) can do little or nothing towards gaming a livelihood. The labour of the father must, therefore, maintain eight persons, and pay the tax for five (the supposed number of males) \u2014 four roubles 9."], [250, "DETAILS OF HUSBANDRY 226 per head per annum to the crown, and two roubles to the district, which gives six roubles per head, or thirty roubles in all. But the tax must be paid in bank assignats, while produce of every kind is sold for money ; the latter currency being here worth eighteen per cent, less than the former. We must, therefore, add five roubles for this difference, and the result is, that the tax amounts to thirty-five roubles * per annum, practi cally falling on one individual; and to raise this sum, even if his crop be a good one, he must sell the produce of two out of his four acres of arable land, and with the remainder he must support his family. Half the year then is occupied in working for his master, and half the remainder, as we see, must be employed in raising the means of paying his taxes, which at first sight appear so small. The peasant, therefore, in reality has but one-fourth of the profit of his year's labour for himself. The dues paid by the crown peasant are three times as great, but he has all his time and all the land to himself, in place of dividing both with a master. This is an advantage ; but to counterbalance this, the crown estates are in general worse managed than those of private individuals. In the latter case the master aids and supports the poor peasant, and defends him from usurious exactions at the hands of the rich, and from all vexatious treatment ; while on the crown estates the rich peasant is continually increasing his wealth, but the poor man becomes utterly rained, besides being constantly subject to eveiy sort of vexation. This state of things has become so intolerably bad as to demand a complete re-organization, with which General Kissileff has been charged. Besides the poll-taxes which I have mentioned, there are two other imposts which press on the agriculturist. These are the duties which are laid on salt and vodka, or home-made brandy, by the government monopoly of these two articles. Salt indeed is not very dear, but the price of the brandy is exorbitant. This liquor, which is distilled from rye, is sold in the spirit-shops at eight roubles the vedro.-f w-hile its prime cost is but one rouble and a half. This impost, how- * i.e. about 11. 9s. , taking the rouble as = 10_. It will be remembered that the silver rouble had not in 1838 been adopted as the standard. t 1 vedro = 2-705 imperial gallons."], [251, "AND RURAL ECONOMY. 227 ever, is at least indirect, and it depends upon the choice of every individual to be affected by it or not. In fact, though drunkards are to be met with, this is by no means the general character of the people, a fact which I can prove statistically. The district of Tamboff, with the town, com prises a peasant population, male and female, of 180,000, while its consumption of spirits amounts to 120,000 vedros. Deduct for the consumption of the nobility and trading class 20,000 vedros, and of the peasant population suppose one-fourth, or 45,000, to consist of women and children who never drink spirits, and you will have 100,000 vedros to be consumed by 135,000 men, which amounts to but two small glasses of spirits for each per week, reckoning about a hundred glasses to the vedro, and this is certainly not much. Every gentleman and person in easy circumstances takes in general twenty-one glasses a week, according to our ordinary custom of drinking a petit verre before dinner, another as a chasse cafe', and a third before supper, and yet no one thinks of calling such persons drunkards. The peasant, however, has gained this character, by drinking quass all the year round, excepting on two or three days, when he varies his monotonous existence by a fit of excessive intoxication. Besides which, here, as everywhere else, one man, when drunk, makes more disturbance than a hundred when sober. There is another grand disadvantage under which our agri culture labours, in the land not being divided. The law of Catherine the Second only partitioned the villages ; a more special provision is yet to come. This subject at present occupies the attention of Government ; but the difficulties to be overcome are immense. Here Mr. Sabouroff's instructive letter concludes. I believe that by the last clause he means that the law, as it now stands, provides only for the division of separate properties, and that the measure to be desired is one which would assign to each peasant his own allotment, so as to give him a permanent interest in its improvement. I think, however, that one most important obstacle to the prosperity of the landed interest of Russia is not alluded to by Q 2"], [252, "228 DETAILS OK HUSBANDRY, ETC. Mr. Sabouroff, and this is the compulsory partition of an estate among the children of a proprietor at his death. This law reduces every man to the condition of a life-tenant on his pro perty, and must often prevent him from beginning an extensive sj-stem of improvement, which he cannot expect each of his various heirs to follow up, or which, when the estate became divided, as it must be, would be probably out of their power. The law at the same time destroys those feelings of local attachment and pride with which a man regards the property which is connected with the names of his fathers, and which he hopes to hand down intact to his descendants. The following prices of provisions and agricultural produce at Tamboff, in November, 1837, are, I believe, tolerably cor rect. They prove the extreme scarcity of money alluded to by Mr. Sabouroif : \u2014 s. d. Fat turkeys 1 10 per couple. Ditto geese 2 0 ditto Ditto fowls or ducks ... 1 3 ditto Black game 1 0 per brace. Gelinottes 1 8 ditto Meat from hd. to Id. per lb. Eye 3s. 9d. per chetvert ; wheat somewhat dearer. Potatoes from 8rf. to lOd. per chetvert. Oats, as I was assured, had been sold as low as Is. per chetvert, though it seems hardly credible. '"], [253, "CENSUS OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE TAKEN IN THE YEAE 1836.
