INTRODUCTORY. \" They unto whom we shall appear tedious are in no wise injured by us, because it is in their own hands to spare that labour which they are not willing to endure.\" In one of the best situations of the beautiful city of B , with a stout paling in front, and a tolerably spacious garden running lengthways behind, standing alone, was a house named \" Lansdowne Villa.\" The portico and the steps, the brass bell-handle and the windows, were the admiration of all the trades people who called for daily orders. A few other villas were scattered about, built something in the same style, but none of them had so large a garden. In front, lay spread out a very lovely view, for the villas were built on a hill. Boards were up, ad vertising that the ground opposite was for sale on a building lease. But they had stood there till vol. I. B"], [14, "UPS AND DOWNS. 2 the painted notice was well nigh rubbed out. No one cared to build more houses, whde whole rows in terraces, crescents, squares, and streets, remained untenanted, and rents had fallen so grievously. Fashion, capricious dame as she is, beckoned her followers elsewhere. So the beautiful city subsided into a state of great quietness, and her former gaiety and greatness was a thing of the past. But schools still flourished, and foremost among them stood the reputation of Lansdowne villa, and Mrs. Harding, in her tasteful, quiet half-mourning, worn since she became a widow some twenty y*ears since, was pronounced a woman to whom any mother might entrust her children. It was a favourite place for unfortunate West Indian ladies to send their daughters. Mrs. Hardiness letters about them were so comforting to the hearts of these mothers. She was a mother herself, and well she knew how to describe the expanding traits of her \" interesting charges.\" Mrs. Harding had the gift of speech, as well with the pen as by word of mouth, a twofold advantage with which the same person is rarely endow*ed. Many* and beautifully graphic were the pictures her pen described. She painted the children at their plays in the garden, described their grace and agility, their animation and glow of health ; or touched feelingly and wisely on any* delicacy or tendency to faults. Parents could fancy tbeir absent loved ones, though"], [15, "INTRODUCTORY. 3 doomed to pass theh holidays at school, enjoying the comforts of a home. When they were old enough, Mrs. Harding kindly took them out with her and her daughters to any smad parries or concerts which offered. Then, her pupds were so well \" finished.\" Almost aU left her, famous for one or more than one accomplishment. They either played, or sang, or drew, in no common way. The very best masters were engaged. No trouble, no expense was spared. The one thing which made Mrs. Harding angry, and brought a frown on her smooth, placid fore head was for her \"children\" to call her house a \" school.\" She would have it nothing but \" home\" for all. When Mrs. Harding entered a room, whether a private one or in a public place for a concert, all eyes rested on the two or three remarkably elegant girls who accompanied her. She explained her reason for taking them out rather more than was usual with school-girls. \" It was to form their manners, and accustom these young creatures to society,\" for she said, it was much better for them to be introduced gradually. She did not approve of the system of confinino- young people so strictly to the schoolroom, and then suddenly bringing them into the whirl of a gay life. It upset and dazzled them, for the con trast was too great. And people quoted her sayings, and thought her a paragon of a schoolmistress. E 2"], [16, "4 UPS AND DOWNS. The long, straggling garden, too, w*as such a very great advantage. A sloping lawn afforded space for games on a summer evening. Two noble old walnut trees, with benches round them, gave shade for those who liked to carry their books and learn their lessons there. The well kept gravel walks were dry even in winter ; and sheltered delightfully from the east by a high wall. This really* beautiful piece of ground ended in a kitchen garden. There was, however, no division be tween the tw*o, at least none but a clipped hedge of yew, against which some old-fashioned single crimson roses showed well. At the bottom of the garden, stood a tool and seed house, with a pretty fanciful roof. And a door in the wall, which was low here, hut guarded by a frightful-looking defence of spikes and broken glass, led out into a long, narrow lane, famous for scented violets, and which led on and on to a charming down, where the freshest air was always to be found. So the inmates of Lansdowne Villa could get a famous, healthy, free walk, with out going into any street at all, or meeting a soul. Nothing coidd be more perfectly adapted for a school! and, accordingly, about thirty girls of all ages found work for a French teacher and two English teachers, besides Mrs. Harding to super intend all, and masters innumerable. A gentleman sat in the comfortable and handsome"], [17, "INTRODUCTORY. 5 drawing-room, which looked out ou the lawn. A party of girls were playing Les Graces ; occasionally their young, ringing voices reached through the closed window, and the gentleman's attention was thereby* drawn towards the garden. \" A very nice game ! \" he remarked. \"Yes; I encourage it; also battledore and shuttle cock. It is good for the figure.\" \" That 's a fine girl, the one with the hoop ; I think she was at the concert with you last week.\" \" She was. Poor young thing, she is in mourning for her mother. She and her twin sister were con fided to my care at a very early age while their parents were in Jamaica. They are like my own children, as you may suppose, though the other fell into weak health and left me.\" \"In another year or two, she w*ill be positively beautiful,\" observed the gentleman, with great anima tion, as he watched her run nearer to the window in pursuit of the hoop which had rolled away. \" It is a singular face though,\" he added. \" Pray, is she musical ? \" \" Yes ; and promises to excel.\" But further con versation was stopped by the entrance of a little girl, who greeted the gentleman shyly as \" Uncle.' : He was a man apparently in the prime of life, not perhaps regularly handsome, yet singularly pleasing, particularly when lighted up with the eager anima tion which alsvavs came when he talked."], [18, "6 UPS AND DOWNS. Mrs. Harding observing that, of course, he would like seeing his niece alone, bade him a stately good morning, which was returned in a warmer and more demonstrative fashion. Apparently, he was a man whose feelings lay near the surface and were easdy and gracefully brought into play: and his heart warmed towards her who took the place of mother to his little orphan niece ! As Mrs. Harding crossed the lofty and spacious hall, on her way to the study, for such the school room was called, she said to herself, while a satisfied smile curled her lips \u2014 \" She shall come down certainly. She does one credit. In her white muslin and a broad black sash, she will look lovely, and Signor Zanelli will then sing his best and not be sulky.\" \" You must come to Mrs. Harding hi her dressing room directly,\" said the same little girl who had received her uncle, an hour afterwards, and touching the young Les Graces player on the shoulder. She started, and looked up inquiringly. \" Oh, 'tis no scolding, I am very sure ! She is in good-humour ! I have such lots to tell you, my darling,\" she went on in a rapid, caressing manner. \" My dear uncle, dear old fellow ! he asked so many questions, all about you ! You were on the lawn, you know, and he could see you quite well. He said you were ' bewitching' and all that, and he should"], [19, "7 INTRODUCTORY. certainly go to the next concert for the chance of seeing you. So there.\" \"So there ! \" repeated the elder girl, in a scornful tone ; while she very gently stroked back the little one's hair and kissed her forehead. \"How your little head does run on nonsense, Letty. And please to tell your uncle not to trouble himself about me. Is he young ? \" \" Oh, no ; as old as Methuselah \u2014 nearly thirty, I believe.\" \" What is his name? \" \" Edward\u2014 Uncle Edward.\" \" Edward ! \" and the name was repeated in an absent manner, and with a half-sigh. \"But I must run, or Mrs. Harding won't be in a good-humour, as you say, Letty.\" \" Come in, my dear,\" said Mrs. Harding, in her softest voice. \" I am choosing ribbons, as you see. I want you to appear at a choice little musical party I have invited for to-morrow evening, and I wish you to look neat. Young girls should be always dressed with propriety and with taste ; at your age perfect simplicity is best. Now, a broad sash \u2014 so \u2014 will set off your muslin dress nicely, and you must be very careful to braid your hair well. You are very careless about it sometimes, you know, which is inexcusable, for your hair is a great beauty.\" Seeing her pupil looked grave and preoccupied, and not quite so much delighted as she expected, she"], [20, "8 UPS AND DOWNS. added, \" I will whisper a little secret in your ear. You are a child no longer now. Don't sigh so, love, there is no reason that should make you un happy. Well, listen ; at this party there will be a person, one of those fortunate persons, possessing figure, manner, and an immense fortune ; of very good birth, too. In fact, he is the desire of ad the mammas and daughters in the neighbourhood. Now, love, I feel for you as a mother, under the melan choly circumstances ; I have a deep interest in you ; and I should like, I should rejoice and triumph, if this rich, handsome gentleman chanced to admire a certain pet of mine, whom I won't name \u2014 eh ? darling, don't blush so. But look your very best, and be sure to practise that duet you sing with Zanelli.\" \" Who will sing it with me, ma'am ?\" \" Why, himself, to be sure. I hope he will be amiable, or he will spoil the evening, as he did once before. I depend on you a great deal for keeping him in good-humour, he is such an admirer of yours ! \" and she turned again to the ribbons, and thereby did not see the deep scarlet flush which covered the face and neck of the young girl. \"Is that all, ma'am?\" she said, taming half away. \" Yes ; get all your lessons well forward, that you may have time to-morrow to go out with me and choose some flowers for the evening.\""], [21, "INTRODUCTORY. 9 The girl lest the room with measured and sober steps ; but had any one been there to see, they might well have wondered at the flashing of those dark eyes. Springing, jumping, in all the buoyancy of youth, she gaily hummed a song. Yet, before she had reached the study, a grave look of sorrow and care had cast its shadow over her. As she sat down again to con her task, she sighed a deep heavy sigh, and leaning absently and idly over her slate, she allowed her fingers to trace carelessly the name \" Arturo Zanelli,\" then under it she wrote \" Gran ville Edward,\" sighed again, and hastily rubbing the writing out, she set herself in earnest to learn her lesson. A very* slight and graceful figure, in white muslin, and a broad black girdle, danced with a waltz step into a room where chairs were placed in rows con cert fashion. It was not yet lighted up, but she glided along between the seats and stopped in front of a long glass. There was just light enough to see the gene ral effect and outline, and apparently the inspection was satisfactory, for giving a touch here and there, and setting a bouquet of scarlet geraniums more to her fancy, she smiled. Mrs. Harding's hint had not been thrown away. The long, thick silken hair"], [22, "10 UPS AND DOWNS. was carefully braided and wound round her head with taste. It was of peculiar hue, a rich auburn. She started violently at the sound, gentle and sub dued as it was, of a man's voice, and looking round she saw, what had before escaped her, some one sitting by the pianoforte. He came slowly towards her. \" Did I give y*ou alarm ? \" he asked, speaking with a strong foreign accent, but in a most musically toned voice. \" You startled me ! What were you doing in the dark corner ? \" and she laughed merrily. \" Dreaming, dreaming ; and then the vision of my dream appeared to me.\" \" Now don't talk in that way ! you know I dislike it, Signor. I am to sing that duet, Mrs. Harding says.\" \" Ah ! I am enchanted ; come, then, and let us just try it one time over. It will make it sure.\" And without awaiting an answer, he returned to his seat ; and after striking a few chords, he said, \" You remember the notes and the Avords, for it is dark.\" She answered \" Yes,\" and they sang. Presently a head appeared at the door. \" Who is that ? What, Signor Zanelli ! aU in the dark or nearly so \u2014 and you too, my dear. Oh ! prac tising ; well, that is wise ; but, pray, light a candle.\" The girl ran and lit one from the hall lamp ; she"], [23, "INTRODUCTORY. 11 placed it on the instrument, and agam they sang. When it was clone, and he had corrected one or two faults, she said \u2014 \" Will you do one thing for me, Signor Zanelli ? Wid you just \" \" What is there,\" he interrupted, \" that I would not do at your wish, my pupil ? \" His dark eyes bent on her, so that her own drooped. He was not handsome; some persons thought him even ill-looking. It was a thoroughly Italian face, sallow and dark, with jetty hair about it, and his eyes were rather sunken and had a confident bold expression. But he had one all powerful charm \u2014 a most beautiful voice, rare hi its tones, both in speaking and singing. \"What Avas that you wished of me?\" he said, keenly watching her face, as it was turned in profile towards him. \" Only, only \u2014 Avid you sing one song \u2014 now, before any one comes ? \" He answered by playing one of those impassioned strains Avhich Italian music abounds in. Soon his voice mingled with the skilfully played accompani ment, and as it rose and fell, he looked at her. But her face Avas hidden ; she had covered it Avith hoth hands, and sat near, drinking in the melting, thrilling notes, tid the flush of excitement rose and spread. He could see it on her throat, as she bent her head before him."], [24, "12 UPS AND DOWNS. He sang on, and she never moved, till there Avas a sound of approaching steps and voices. He ended suddenly, and she looked up with a long breath. \"They are coming to light the lamps,\" she re marked, and moved aAvay to the other side of the room. He remained where he was, arranging music and trying over a song noAV and then. In a short time some of the company came in from the tea-room. Soon all the chairs were filled ; there Avas the usual stir and bustle of settling, and then the buzz of voices Avas hushed as again the Italian singer's wonderful A*oice floated up and filled the room Avith melody* ; there was a unanimous hum of applause as the last note died, quivering in the air ; but after having bowed, his eyes sought the farthest roAv of seats, AA*here, shrouded by the window curtain, a girl in w*hite dress and black ribbons was just visible. She Avas very still, A'ery* silent, and her eyes were on the floor. But the Signor smded. The holidays were arrived. The English teacher Avas deputed to see two girls into their respective conveyances. A coach was to take one; and, giving the coachman many charges to take care of her, she bade her good-bye. The young girl, who was dressed in black, held out her"], [25, "INTRODUCTORY. 13 hands. \" Good-bye, Miss Parsons ! \" and Avith no very leave-taking face, she leant back, and looked at her felloAv passengers \u2014 a gentleman and a lady, the last sat grimly erect, with her face turned aAvay. She thought she had seen the former somewhere before, and was speculating on his countenance, Avhich Avas attractiA*e, Avhen some one looked in. \" Yes,\" said the coachman ; \" you may go outside, but this here seat is taken. The gent said he would walk onwards and I Avas to pick him up.\" Grumbling, for it was cold, the traveller had to climb to the box, and they started. When fairly on the road, the young girl looked eagerly out of the AvindoAV ; and the colour rose for a moment to her face and then suddenly faded, leav ing her pale. The gentleman addressed her courteously, asking if she would like the window shut \u2014 perhaps she was cold. \" Oh, no ; quite the contrary !\" He then made a few common-place remarks, in a lio-ht and pleasant manner, trying apparently to break the ice of reserve and draAV his companions into conversation. He succeeded Avith the younger traveller. She forgot for a Avhile to look out ; and he ventured to remark that she Avas young to travel in a coach alone ; he Avondered Mrs. Harding allowed it. \" Mrs. Harding ! How do you knoAV about her ?\""], [26, "14 UPS AND DOWNS. asked the girl, with sparkling eyes, and in a tone of surprise. \" Oh, I know her well ; and your face is not strange to me either. I \" But the girl turned from him, for the coachman shouted out and stopped ; and rapidly a man, muffled up, Avith a fanciful travelling-cap pulled over his brow, jumped in and took the seat opposite to the young girl. To her he bowed, and she returned it with a vivid blush and smile. Then he took a keen survey of the other pas sengers, and frowned a good deal after looking at his neighbour; Avhile that gentleman, also, looked far from pleased, and Avhistled, and pulled about his pocket-handkerchief in a restless, almost agitated, manner. Silence resumed its sway. But the gentleman first there cast quick, watchful glances from time to time on the others. The muffled-up man, at last, leant back and shut his eyes. The road was hilly, and heavy from late rain ; at the foot of one hdl steeper than usual, the last arri\\*ed passenger started up and said he should Avalk. No one could doubt as to his being no Englishman, by his voice and accent ; if his appear ance had failed to signify the fact. \" Will the Signora choose to walk ? It will Avarm the feet,\" he said, gently bending forwards. \" Yes ; that is \" and she hesitated, and"], [27, "INTRODUCTORY. 15 blushed, looking towards the other gentleman shyly* ; he was whistling vigorously and bloAving his nose more than ever. But her hand was taken, and Avithout another Avord the foreigner helped her out. No sooner were they gone than the gentleman ceased his Avhistle, and muttering something very like an oath, he stretched his head out of Avindow, dreAV it back with an angry frown, and declared he hated all foreigners. \" But they will find them selves mistaken : \" at which mystical saying, the silent elderly lady stared not a little. At the top of the hill, the coach waited for a minute, and the passengers returned to theh* places. On the girl's face, Avere evident traces of agitation \u2014 even then, tears stood in her eyes, and her mouth was twitching and quivering, while a painful blush covered her face. She kept her head turned steadily away from the others ; but the gentleman who hated foreigners, had caught a glimpse as she entered, and again he fell to whistling. There w*as a look of triumph in the dark foreign countenance, though it was exchanged sometimes for a scoavI of annoyance, at the perpetual whistling of his neighbour \u2014 or now and then for a softened meaning smde as he contrived to bend forAvards and, looking out on the road, addressed some observation in a Ioav tone to the girl."], [28, "16 UPS AND DOWNS. They had reached the first stage, and a quarter of an hour Avas allowed for dinner and changing horses. The cramped up legs of the men Avere vigorously stamping out their stiffness; while the landlady invited them in to partake of some soup the savour of which reached them Avithout. The girl and the foreigner alike declined, and Avere moving quietly- away as if to look about the town. As soon as they had passed the inn, they turned up a by*-street. They had reached the end of the houses, and were, Avith quicker steps, approaching the road. The foreigner was speaking encourag ingly, and pleading something in musical tones, while the girl Avalked with uncertain gait and her head bent down. A loud shout caused them both to look behind. \" It is the coachman ! \" she exclaimed, looking alarmed. \" No, no ; for I explained to him our intention, that is, as far as leaving the coach went, and I paid him Avell, very well.\" \" It is the gentleman, then.\" \" Impertinent ! \" and the foreigner muttered some impatient words in Italian. \" Hallo ! you sir, Avait ! and you, young lady.\" He came up breathless and angry. \" Young lady, alloAV me to have a moment's con versation with you. Come, sir, don't attempt to prevent me, or I will teach you better manners,\""], [29, "INTRODUCTORY. 17 he said to the other, avIio appeared about to re monstrate. With a dark suppressed scoavI, the foreigner bowed and gave a proud smile.

They Avere but going to see the country, not wishing dinner. \"But he is not a friend \u2014 not an acquaintance \u2014 I don't even knoAV his name,\" said the girl, looking haughtily at the intruder. \" I know yours and his,\" pointing to the foreigner. \"My own is of little consequence.

CHAPTER I. DRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6. Colonel Raymond, although the only son of a Avealthy West Indian, and husband to an heiress, found himself early in life obliged to retrench his expenses within a narrow compass. There was no use in struggling against the stream of ruin any longer \u2014 no use in sending more good English money in a A*ain attempt to recall what was gone. He returned, therefore, to England, sick at heart with the panic which desolated his native island. His wife had been his cousin, and the elder branch of the family, many* years since transplanted from the tropics to England. Consequently, the old family seat, the Abbey, came to him through her ; and it Avas a sore trial to all when the stately old place had to be sold, and passed into the hands of strangers. SeA*eral years before the date at Avhich our tale begins, the Raymonds took Avhat AA'as termed in the advertisement, \" A genteel family residence, within an easy Avalk of the convenient market-town of Poole.\" Colonel Raymond w*as now a Avidower, with four"], [35, "DRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6. 23 daughters, the two elder being much older than the two younger. One of the former had married into an old established Poole family. Her twin sister Ellen, was therefore left to preside alone at her father's table. But she Avas not so popular as her married sister, Mrs. John Mortimer. Though very handsome, and even fascinating in manner when she wished to please, she had not many friends among the Poole people. They acknoAvledged her beauty, but \" feared she Avas not amiable,\" in the same breath : and about this period rumours were afloat, as to her not being on very good terms with her sister and her sister's husband, whde it was almost an open quarrel between her and her father's great friend and adviser Mrs. Hay. This lady Avas also a West Indian, and late in life had married a medical man at Poole, who had an extensive practice and stood high in general estimation. He Avas brother to Mrs. Mortimer of the Bank House, and \"The Mortimers\" formed a \\*ery important part of Poole. Mr. Hay adopted lus nephew John Mortimer before he married, and at his death left him his practice and a good sum on which to establish himself; thinking his own boy amply provided for through his mother's West Indian property, added to his own modest savings.

He complained loudly against the settling of another medical man in the town, although Dr. Moore took pains to assure Mr. John Mortimer that he should in no Avay interfere with him ; that he did not intend to practise generally, and had a private and independent income. A sister liA*ed with Dr. Moore, avIio promised to prove an acquisition to the society ; although she surprised people, and perhaps a little annoyed many, by- very early showing a decided preference for Miss Raymond's conversation and society \u2014 speaking warmly in praise of her charms. For while all the gentlemen, both old and young, admired Ellen Raymond, there Avas scarcely one of her own sex in the tOAvn who could afford to giA*e her praise without at least a draAvback. Miss Moore's strange liking was, therefore, a subject of much talk, and many a sharp speech did it call forth from the Mortimers, who looked on the new resident as a rival of their brother. For many years the Mortimer family had beeii looked up to by general consent as a leadino authority in Poole. The only bank had been in"], [37, "25 DRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6. their name as long as men remembered the town. The house in Avhich they still lived, standing con spicuously in the market-place, gave an impression of solid respectability. The present head of the house kept up the credit of his forefathers, and Avas an excellent son and brother, supplying his father's place in every way. The mother Avas an invalid and a prisoner to her peculiar room. Her children, save one, did not take after her ; she remained in one sense alone and apart from them all, and in speaking of their mother they Avere apt to take a slightly patronizing tone, and call her \" poor Mrs. Mortimer.\" She was sensitive aifd nervous, and naturally demonstrative ; which did not at all belong or apply to a Mortimer: in short, except in name, and through earnest admiration of her husband and all their children, a \" Mortimer\" \u2014 a true Mortimer \u2014 the poor mother never became. The Mortimers were considered a fine family : even a handsome family ; and they admired each other exceedingly, not neglecting the old fable of the bundle of faggots. There Avas a strong family likeness, and yet a marked variation betw*een them. Cecil, or Mr. Mortimer, was sensible, good-looking, and thoroughly business-like ; a large massive man, clear-eyed, serene and benevolent, with a heavy, sweet smile, reminding one of the Egyptian type, but often relieved by a certain curl of the lip pre ceding some dry joke. He was said to be strictly"], [38, "26 UPS AND DOWNS. punctual, honourable, and just, with a little of the famdy self-confidence, which in weaker characters became conceit. He was fond and proud of his brothers and sisters, but especially of John, whose fadings he was apt to indulge and overlook. The eldest daughter \" Miss Mortimer,\" as they all called her, was a handsome, well preserved woman, not pretending to be young. Her keen eyes and curling lips made people a little afraid of her quizzing and satirical remarks. She was the apparent head and ruler of the household ; the one, to whom all looked up and consulted. The next sister, Anne, was plain, and A*ainly trying hard to imitate her eldest sister, subsided into a reader of big books ; while her con versation, w*hich was meant to be literary, was only prosy, A'aried now and then by moral advice on the subject of fri\\*olity given to Rose, the belle and the youngest of the family. Besides these, there Avas a married sister living far away, and another brother coming betAveen Cecil and John, who had, Avhen this story begins, been absent from home, on a long travelling tour. His return was now expected almost daily, and proved a subject of speculation in the place ; for he had the reputation of being clever or learned, and different from his brothers, before he left home, in his shy avoidance of all general society. To understand all that Avas meant hy \" The Morti mers,\" a residence in Poole Avas necessary. There was a Mortimer \" way,\" : a Mortimer ankle : a"], [39, "DRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6. 27 Mortimer vocabulary ; and, though last, not least, a Mortimer voice, Avhich made their family glees and catches very charming: as their Aunt Mrs. Hay Avas Avont softly- to ejaculate in her tone interro gatory, \" The Mortimers Avere born musical \u2014 a very clever family ? \" This Mrs. Hay*, being an important person and closely mixed up Avith the events of our tale, it is as AveU to introduce her here, and explain that she was an old acquaintance of Colonel Raymond's in the West Indies. By her advice they retreated to Poole when the Abbey was sold, and during the linger ing dlness and at the death of Mrs. Raymond she pleaded her former intimacy, and insisted on supply ing the mother's place to the poor unfortunate little children. Her age was difficult to guess. Without being at all handsome, there was a certain style about her and a degree of elegance Avhich, added to the fact of her being always well dressed, caused many persons to admire her. Her manners were soft and insinuating in general, and in spite of the Creole languors which in some degree pervaded her speech and movements, Mrs. Hay was the con fidante and adviser of every one \u2014 every one but Ellen Raymond. But her utmost endeavours could not gain for her the confidence or love of her \" friend the Colonel's\" daughter; to her great and infinite distress. Her handsome boy \u2014 for he Avas scarcely more than"], [40, "28 UPS AND DOWNS. a boy at this time \u2014 succeeded better : he and Ellen were fast friends and constant partners at all the dances, at AA-hich his mother could scarcely conceal her dislike. But Alick was a spoilt child; and perhaps, were the truth known, it added a zest to his flirtations with Ellen to feel Iioav such proceedings irked his lady mother. Her reproachful glances from behind her fan, as her handsome son led out Ellen again and again for the dance in bold defiance of etiquette and remarks, afforded great amusement to the bystanders; and especially to the keen and observing Miss Mortimer, avIio made a point of praising her aunt, Mrs. Hay, in high terms, as an \"excellent kind-hearted woman, always A\\*illing to help her friends; especially her ' West Indian friends,' \" on which words she laid a slight emphasis. Miss Mortimer's description of Mrs. Hay Avas too good a one not to be repeated, i. e., that \" she is made up of undulations, and has the power of gliding into hidden corners \u2014 eA*en into one's heart, without being discoA*ered : never walking straight into a room, but Avaving slightly like a tall tree in a gentle breeze. Uncertain and insinuating, with a note of interrogation or pause at the end of each sentence \u2014 and with all this, a physiognomist Avould pronounce the mouth and chin as characteristic of determination ; therefore, it must be allowed that Mrs. Hay is a riddle not easily found out.\" Mrs. Hay confirmed the popular opinions as to"], [41, "DRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6. 29 her kindness and liberality, by her conduct to her husband's nephew John Mortimer ; for whom she ahvays professed a motherly regard and interest. This she extended to his SAveet little wife, Bessie \u2014 a meek, gentle, dove-eyed Avoman, avIio considered it honour and happiness enough for her to call her self wife to her dear, clever, handsome John, and AA'ho received every little mark of attention from him or his family, Avith sincere gratitude, and Avilling, if she could, to put away all quarrelling or offences ; but her influence not being sufficient, she grieved secretly at the sad Avant of unity and good understanding Avhich she saAV to exist betAveen her husband and her twin sister, and also betAveen Ellen and her husband's \" good kind aunt.\"' When John Mortimer married her, common report had made her heiress to an old lady whose wealth was said to be great ; Mrs. Ullathorne, however, died, leaA*ing everything to a stranger, and only the sum of ten pounds a year and a mourning ring to her god-daughter Bessie. And now the rumour Avas, that this change of Avill Avas all oAving to Ellen's insinuations against her sister's husband, when once a visitor at the old lady's house not very long before she died. It was, in fact, during this very visit that Bessie's engagement and marriage (which quickly folloAved) took place. Ellen's absence from the wedding, and subsequent circumstances were strung together, so as to form a rather serious charge against her : the report went"], [42, "30 UPS AND DOWNS. even further, in saying that Ellen was engaged, or about to be engaged, to the gentleman who was Mrs. Ullathorne's heir. Such rumours reached Ellen's ear, and added considerably to the haughty, cold reserve of which the Poole people complained. But she shared her grievance with no one ; haA*ing no friend, and pro fessing to have none, except indeed one whose name she rarely uttered : and she \u2014 the idol of EUen's heart and fancy, once her own mother's companion and friend in girlhood, was at this time in Italy. But amid much that was jarring and trying in her home life, contrasting with her father's coldness, and her separation from her twin sister since the marriage \u2014 the idea of this friend stood in bold and bright relief; a harbour of refuge \u2014 a port \u2014 which, once gained, would he to her both home and happi ness. Hence keeping much aloof and apart from all Poole society*, Ellen led a solitary life, only varied by a participation in the evening gaieties ; Avhich for so small a place Avere considerable. These were her moments of triumph; AA'hen her beauty made her the most earnestly sought partner, and invariably drew a circle of admirers, Avherever she might he. It must be owned that she brightened up at this, and felt a little consoled hy the evident displeasure that such \" had taste among the gentlemen \" provoked her critics to show. But for those who saw beneath"], [43, "DRAMATIS PERSON\u00c6. 31 the surface and recognised her worth, hidden as it was by faults, it was pitiful to Avatch so young a person grow bitter and hard, Avith the sort of feeling \u2014 \" Every one is against me,\" betrayed hi her every gesture and word. Her mother's death had, so to speak, launched her \\*ery early on stormy waters. And even where, through her different nature, Bessie was spared, Ellen often had to battle alone Avith adverse currents and dangerous sunken rocks. Their father's nature and habits caused him to keep aloof from them, and he seemed only too glad to leave \" kind Mrs. Hay \" to step in and decide a doubtful question or suggest a plan; her judgment being considered by him infallible. This early caused great grief to both sisters; though Bessie soon learnt to bend to the necessity, and when she loved John Mortimer, was only too ready at his bidding to consider his aunt all that a Avoman should be. But between Ellen and Mrs. Hay there was ahvays a repelling poAver. Hide it as they might try to do, each felt conscious of a secret mistrust and dislike; and the more Mrs. Hay's authority and advice Avere urged by the Colonel for his daughter's guidance, the more distasteful Avas it to her; till, at last, Avith no longer peace-making, gentle Bessie at hand to soothe them, at least into outward understanding, former restraint was broken"], [44, "32 UPS AND DOWNS. doAvn, and words were uttered which leave wounds hard to heal. And noAV leaving the different characters thus briefly hinted at, to speak for themselves, we must folloAv our heroine, with all her faults, in the many \" ups and doAvns \" of her life."], [45, "33 CHAPTER II. NORTH HOUSE. Two young girls were seated in a far corner of a Avell furnished room, playing chess, or what they chose to call chess. Castles, Bishops, and Knights hopped about in strangely undignified haste, and even at the critical moment when Royalty was left exposed to the enemy, there was a suppressed yet merry giggle, and an interchange of Avhispers and emphatic nods, which betrayed that, from their shaded corner, the little girls Avere making observations and Avere more intent on watching the moves of their elders than their OAvn ivory* toys. The Avind Avas whistling and sighing round the house, and an occasional sharp patter of rain broke the silence, while it deepened the sense of comfort produced by massive folds of crimson drapery, the thick Turkey carpet and the blazing fire. The principal figure in the room Avas the master, their father, Colonel Raymond. The flickering blaze which leapt up round the fresh log of Avood, threw his profile into strong relief against the dark crimson paper. He Avas a striking looking person, more picturesque, perhaps, than hand- vol. i. n"], [46, "34 UPS AND DOWNS. some, with finely formed and rather] higV features, and a keen, flashing eye, hardly at all softened by the years which had streaked his hair and left lines round his mouth. Nearly behind him, with her hack to the chess players, and half hidden in the piled-up cushions of a luxurious chair, reclined his daughter. Father and child were strikingly alike. She held a book, but her eyes were fixed on him : they were both very still and silent. \" Just as if they were acting ; isn't it, Ruth ? \" whispered one of the httle girls. \" Hush, Hetty ! I am sure it is coming. See hoAv his forehead knits up ; I Avouldn't be Ellen, not I.\" \" Does she knoAV? \" \" What, that Mrs. Hay said all that to papa ? I don't think she knows ! \" The speaker here gave a long look at her father, and turning a httle paler, she again whispered to her sister, who wore an amused curious expression. \" Will he turn her out of doors really, Hetty? Do you think he will? It is blowing and raining so ! Oh ! hoAV you frightened me.\" The overthrow of some of the chessmen caused Colonel Raymond to turn round, and say \u2014 \" Be careful, children.\" At which they bit their lips and looked at one another, and then again glanced towards Eden. She had not stirred at the noise : with her hand"], [47, "NORTH HOUSE. 35 shading her eyes from the strong fire-light, she still gazed at her father. He suddenly rose from his chair and turned round Avith his back to the fire. Their eyes met. Hers immediately dropped on the open book, and without further change of posture, she seemed ab sorbed in its contents. But a change came over Colonel Raymond. He passed from his remarkable stillness into a restless and fidgetty mood. He stirred the fire, and moved the chimney ornaments; wheeled his chair round and then back again ; and then, flourishing his handker chief, he astonished the old Newfoundland dog and the little girls by his loud trumpet-like performances. From behind the bandana he looked towards the cushioned chair \u2014 the very beau ideal as it Avas of lazy luxuriance. But nothing save a very beautiful hand and arm, and a long roll of bright hair, was to be seen. The book had been slightly shifted, and now aided the hand in screening the fair face from the fire glow. Colonel Raymond sat doAvn again; and presently opened a pocket-book and wrote thereon ; looking up occasionally, as if questioning the flames. Then there was a well known \" hem ! \" a prepara tory clearing of the voice, and the little girls put their heads close together and whispered \u2014 \" It is coming.\" \" Ellen ! \u2014 if your studies are not too absorbing, I want your attention for a moment \u2014 if you please.\" D 2"], [48, "36 UPS AND DOWNS. These last three words were spoken in a tone of command and frigid coldness. The book was instantly folded and laid on her knees, while her head remained drooping a little, and half-turned away* from the Colonel. \" You knoAV it is my annual custom to please the Avorthy Poole people by giving an evening party \u2014 a great bore it is, but I suppose it is necessary.

I have no proper sealing wax,\" said Ellen. \" Go to bed, children,\" said Colonel Raymond. \" You sit up too late ! \" Ellen gathered up her writing materials and pre pared to go Avith them, but was stopped by her father's saying \u2014 \" I have something to say to you, Ellen. I wish you to remain.\" \" Now for it ! \" whispered the children to each other, and they tried each in her own way to gather from Ellen's face what she expected, as they kissed her and, said \" Good-night, Nell.\" Hetty gazed Avith keen and searching eyes ; Ruth stole a shy glance, blushing meanwhile. But Ellen gently pushed them away, and shut the door on them. Puttino- back her hair as if its weight was unbear able, and then pressing one hand on her side, she sat doAvn ; but not in the luxurious chair. \" It is painful, Ellen, very painful, to me to hear such things of you, as I am now continually hear ing ! \" He paused, but there was no reply \u2014 not even a movement."], [50, "38 UPS AND DOWNS. \" I have long known of your un sisterly conduct,\" he continued, his voice gradually getting louder and harsher. \" Your vanity and coquetry, and your most unbecoming behaviour to your \u2014 I may say, best friend.

There is a Mor timer custom, a Mortimer dialect, a Mortimer fashion \u2014 you Avill soon see Avhat I mean.\" \" Yes,\" ansAvered Miss Moore ; and as Bessie left them to speak to Mrs. Hay, she added, \" I agree With you, but I like the Mortimers.\" \"And I do not,\" said Ellen; \"but here conies Miss Mortimer to verify the proverb.\" Miss Mortimer was looking her best : dressed in a style a little too old, Avhich consequently made her look younger. Her complexion was clear and soft, her teeth brilliant, her eyes bright with quick thoughts. As she advanced, her pencilled eyebrows were elevated, as if in surprise. \"Ah, Colonel ! Iioav \\*ery cleverly you do contrive this room and the light. And that matting from the verandah door \u2014 Ah, you West Indians are so luxurious.\" The Colonel boAved, and said he should think it quite unpardonable to ask ladies to leaA-e their homes on such a night Avithout doing his A-ery best to make them comfortable. Miss Mortimer noAV nodded to Mrs. Hay, avIio was by the Avay insinuating to Robert that a couch Avould be better placed this Avay and a chair that ; to all which hints the said Robert looked very grim, and said, \" \"IVas all the same to him, but 'twas difficult to suit the taste of so many- directors.\""], [61, "THE COLONEL'S BALL. 49 \" Ah, Mrs. Hay ! as usual, kind and busy I see ; saving Miss Raymond so much trouble,\" and Miss Mortimer smiled the brighter as she saAV Eden frown. \"Well, yes,\" said Mrs. Hay, \"I always think that so much depends on the placing of seats, so I Avas suggesting a few alterations to that excellent Robert, just to break the circle, you see. But,\" \u2014 loAvering her voice \u2014 \"he is rather difficult to deal with ; quite a character : an original, and lord of his own Avay, as old servants are.\" Then Mrs. Hay* glided on to the Colonel, and a short whispering consultation took place. Presently Colonel Raymond approached his daugh ter Bessie, and took her hand with the manner of a courtier. \"Let me congratulate you, Mrs. John Mortimer, on your good looks this evening. Positively, my dear, you are charming ; and that blush is very becoming. John is coming, I hope. Hem ! \u2014 By the by, since unfortunately there is no Mrs. Raymond, I must trouble you, my married daughter, to do the honours \u2014 eh ? \" \"Oh, no, papa; Ellen will. She is the proper person, and will do it so much better.\" \" No, no ; it should be a married woman. I did ask Mrs. Hay if she would have the goodness to do it ; but she with her usual judgment, suggested my married daughter, and she will support and help you. You will greatly oblige me,\" he added, seeing Bessie's troubled and blushing face. vol. I.

I would not have yielded it to her without a fight; but you \u2014 it is quite another thing ! And now* I shall have nothing to do but enjoy myself; and you, old sober matron, as you are, must take all the trouble. Now go and receive Mrs. Taylor,\" she added, giving her sister a little push. \" Where do you get any gentlemen ?\" asked Miss Mortimer of Ellen. \" They are a scarce article in Poole at present.\" \" It Avas difficult ; but papa rode to Kirkeross and engaged a Avhole regiment of red-coats : we shall have several officers. I consider that it is quite a duty they owe to society, that of attending dances : it is all they do by way of benefi t to mankind.\" \" You are severe, Miss Raymond,\" said Miss Moore. \" The military are not favourites evidently, and yet \" \" I know,\" cried Ellen, laughing. \" You are goiiisr to say Avhat estimable men you knoAv among them !

Don't betray me, Miss Moore, but I am going to vex Mrs. Hay lo a Avhite heat. Watch her face as I chatter to Alick,\" and she stepped off, meeting the young man by the pianoforte, and very soon Avas apparently carrying on a vigorous flirtation ; looking bewitchingly pretty, as Miss Moore remarked to Miss Mortimer : and Alick Hay seemed to think so too. Miss Mortimer raised her eyebroAvs, and said, she knew Miss Ray-mond was thought handsome ; but it was not in the style she admired : but, she added, \" Alick is a pretty felloAv ; isn't he ? His mother's darling \u2014 and plague ! She will be vexed if he stays Avorshipping there long. You Avould not guess Miss Raymond to be fiancee, would you, Miss Moore ? Yet I shrewdly suspect it is so, or something hke it : indeed my authority was good ; but it is not spoken of publicly, as they say her father does not approve.\" \" You surprise me ! And does Mr. Alick Hay suspect such a thing ?\" \"I should rather think not. He is frightfully smitten, but his epaulettes wiU cure him. The truth is, Eden Raymond is a finished flirt. I am expiring with curiosity to witness a certain meeting to-night. You must know, Miss Moore, my brother Granville E 2"], [64, "52 UPS AND DOWNS. returned from his travels to-day and is to be here presently. When he Avas a lad he was greatly bitten with all the Raymonds: quite a sentimental, romantic friendship was hatched up between him and the mother, and, of course, it ended in his fancying him self in love ; not with the mother, hoAveA-er, but the daughters. Such sonnets as he indited about auburn hair and swan-like throats ! There was ahvays a book to be lent, or a lesson in draAving to be giA*en, or a long Avalk in narrow lanes ; in fact the old story But, poor fellow, she preferred my other brother. Granville was not good-looking then, though now he is very tolerable.\" \" Your eldest brother, did she prefer?\" \" Cecil ? Oh, no ! \u2014 John. Fact, I assure you ! John is a great favourite with the women : I tell him he has to ansAver for many pale cheeks. Miss Raymond was desperate. Such a fuss ! When he offered to Bessie, she Avas away, and she would not attend the wedding. It gave her a twist, I think. BetAveen ourselves, I fancy a little eccentricity comes in the blood. She is thought a bad temper ; but, a maiden crossed in love, she must be judged tenderly, eh, Miss Moore?\" \" Poor thing ; if it is really true, it is very sad. But Iioav 1 can't quite understand it. Though, perhaps, it accounts for AAhat puzzled me a little.\" \" You may rely on the truth of what I say : there"], [65, "THE COLONEL'S BALL. 53 can be no doubt. I often wished some one dared to hint to her not to expose herself to the Avorld. But she is one avIio will not take advice. She has become a desperate flirt, of late ; a thing my correct brother Granville abhors and sets doAvn as a capital crime. I expect to-night, his little romance -will melt aAvay : if, indeed, it still exists and he continues to think of her. I expect a little fun, to see his divinity, or ideal (for I believe that is the word), flirting Avith the officers.\" The room Avas filling fast. Several Poole families Avere there, and a few so called \"Grandees\" from the neighbourhood, to whom the Colonel Avas making himself agreeable. Three or four officers had arrived, and Mrs. Hay proposed that dancing should begin : \" It Avas time to break up the stiffness,\" and as she spoke to Bessie, she glanced round towards the two Avho were still laughing and talking together at the pianoforte. \" Bessie, love ! Pray, beseech your unfortunate sister not to make herself so conspicuous. Can y*ou imagine anything in worse taste than her conduct ? \u2014 in her own father's home, to neglect the guests and flirt Avith that poor foolish hoy of mine ! \" and Mrs. Hay sighed, while a curious struggle betAveen anger and desire to be soft and amiable, was betrayed both in voice and expression of countenance. Bessie did as she Avas desired, and gravely begged"], [66, "54 UPS AND DOWNS. her sister not to draw attention on herself and annoy poor Mrs. Hay \u2014 \" for she said she did not like it.\" \" The very reason I do so ! \" retorted Ellen, widi a shrug of the shoulders. \" Alick ! \" turning to him, \" do you hear ? Your mamma forbids you talking to me.\" \" That's an old story ; unfortunately, mammas can't be always obeyed. I'll smooth her over to-morroAv, and I don't mean to catch her eye to-night. Come, Nelly-, don't let us lose this delicious waltz.\" And off they Avhirled. \"If people Avould but let me alone,\" said Ellen, when at length they stopped. \" It is very hard they won't let me be amiable ! I came down with such excellent intentions this evening \u2014 a very* pattern of goodness \u2014 and iioav \" \" Well ! what now ? \" the young man asked, looking with very undisguised admiration at her. \" Why, it is all gone ! and I am in a humour to defy every one.

It isn't pleasant to feel oneself talked over in that style But my spirit is high \u2014 they shan't have the pleasure of breaking it.\" \" A fig for all the envy and ill-nature of women ! Don't heed it, Ellen ; for it is envy ! I like you the better for your spirit. Nelly, your eyes are too"], [67, "THE COLONEL'S BALL. 55 bright \u2014 too dazzling almost to-night. That sash, too, is spicy ; blue becomes your complexion and hair : and Avas it not a good hit of mine, choosing white camelias \u2014 I very nearly fixed on the red.\" \" Lucky you did not : red never suits my hair.\" And they Avaltzed again. Nothing could exceed the devotion of Alick Hay to Ellen Raymond. Sometimes she was rather cold and sharp hi her way of receiving his attention, but to-night she was flatteringly kind, and he was half intoxicated Avith her smdes and her beauty. When she Avas claimed by other partners, he persisted in standing out and Avatching her, holding her fan, or securing a seat; for betAveen the dances she seemed to be weary : an unusual thhig for her. Never, how ever, had she been more brilliant than this evening. Generally- pale, the bright but delicate pink flush produced by excitement added lustre to her eyes, which were a shade darker than her hair, and, all fire at one moment, softened into exquisite gentleness the next. All the gentlemen, particularly the strangers, were struck with her beauty. The ladies, also, looked and admired ; but some shook their heads at her flighty manners ; and a few thought it a pity some kind friend did not try to calm her evident excitement. Miss Moore watched her with interest : once, during the figure of a quadrille, she said, \"You seem in very high spirits to-night.\""], [68, "56 UPS AND DOWNS. Ellen ansAvered, \" I am playing the fool. I can't help it ; I must do so, or go away to bed.\" \" Again, Alick ! this will be the third time. But if I do, you must promise directly* after to leave me and go and play the agreeable to Rosamond Mortimer and the Taylors, et cetera. And \u2014 really, I am very tired.\" So said Ellen, as Alick came to coax her to be his partner for another av altz. \" But this time \u2014 your own favourite. It Avill soon take off fatigue,\" said he, putting his arm round her ; and it seemed as if it did. No couple among the dancers moved more liglitly or more rapidly- to the thrilling music. They paused ; her hand Avas on his arm, and he looked down at her proudly and fundly, as a very young man does in his first fascina tion. Presently he said \u2014 \" Granville Mortimer is uncommonly improA*ed : I declare he is not such a bad looking felloAv after all, in spite of his sandy hair ! \" \" Have you seen him ? \" \"Just for an instant, when I w*as getting your lemonade just now. He didn't knoAV me, but that is no great Avonder .\" \" Just iioav! \" she interrupted. \" Do you mean he is here ? \" \" Look there, behind the door : there he stands as large as life, and very grim he looks too !

What ails the fellow? standing glowering there, as if we were a parcel of sinners. But won't you speak to him \u2014 wel come the traA-eller home ? \u2014 Shall Ave go up to him ? \" \" No, no ! \" she said, pulling him back. \" I wonder I did not see him come in ! \" \" Well, it is nothing to groAv pale about ! He has been very happy, I dare say. My mother got hold of him in the tea-room : she is fond of her nephew.\" \" And his brother is whispering to him now,\" said Ellen, Avith a strange look. \" Alick ! I should like to hear that Avhisper : ain't I curious, now ? \" \" Shall I go and ask what it Avas,\" rejoined he, laughing. \" But haA*e another turn ? \" \" Oh, I can't move another step ! \u2014 Yes ; I will though.\" She continued talking lively, sharp bits of nonsense, eA*en Avhile they danced ; and the colour came back to her cheeks, and the sparkle to her eye. \" Noav you deserve a good seat, and here is one,\" said her partner, leading her to a cushioned chair Avhich stood rather in a corner, being in the bow of the AvindoAV and partly sheltered by the curtain drapery. \" A cosy little spot this,\" Alick said, drawing out a footstool for himself to sit on. \"Don't stay here, Alick. The supper will be announced directly, and you must please to go and take out some ladA*.\""], [70, "58 UPS AND DOWNS. \"I will take out Miss Raymond. Here comes Captain Breton, ready to challenge me out of sheer envy. He ahvays likes to have the belle of the room ; to-night he has been cheated.\" \" Alick, do please to leave me ! Just look at your mother ! You must, indeed, to please me.\" \"Well, that is a plea I can't resist. To please you then, Nelly, for the present good-bye. Don't he too beAvitching to the Captain, who is casting longing eyes hither, I see ; I shall be desperately jealous, for he is a renowned lady-killer.\" \" Nonsense ! \" she said, as if weary and rather vexed ; and Avhen the devoted youth left her side, she leant back, so that her face was hidden by the curtain, and for one moment, it almost seemed as if tears were struggling to come. But she fanned herself with energy, and then absently pulled one of her beautiful camelia buds to pieces. At the sound of approaching steps, she looked up hurriedly, and seeing it was the Captain Avhom Alick had spoken of, she bowed coldly, and glanced searchingly round the room, as far as her position enabled her to see. Captain Breton began making some of those remarks Avhich are the usual accompaniments of a party, together with jelly and lemonade. \" You are fatigued, I fear, Miss Raymond,\" he remarked, after finding that he only received mechanical ansAvers, and that his speeches failed in calling up the smile Avhich had caught his"], [71, "THE COLONEL'S BALL. 59 admiration before, when he had watched her with others. \" Will you alloAv me the honor of taking you into the supper-room. You have \u2014 ah \u2014 exerted yourself so much \u2014 and \u2014 a little Avine or chicken will, I am sure \" \"Thank you, but I mean to wait. Our room will hardly hold all at once, and there are so few gentlemen, Captahi Breton, that, instead of taking me, may I ask you to take some other lady ? \" \" You are cruel, Miss Raymond.

Since you insist on it, I will obey. The first dance after supper, then.\" Ellen answered his bow Avith one quite as low, and took a long breath Avhen he was gone. The room Avas now nearly empty: just one or two young couples were making fun with the violins left hy the musicians Avhile they went for refresh ment. \"May I hope for a word, one word \u2014 at last?\" was said in a low voice close behind Ellen, on the other side of the looped-up curtain. She started violently and dropped her flowers."], [72, "60 UPS AND DOWNS. The flush deepened and spread over her face, as \u2022she held out her hand to Granville Mortimer. It Avas taken, but someA\\*hat coldly, and she hastily uithdrew it, and stooped to pick up the camelias, biting her lips. \" I did \u2014 did not know you Avere there,\" she said, presently-, but hesitatingly. \" No ; I Avatched your dancing \u2014 and folloAved you, intending but you were so engaged, I did not like to intrude. You saw me by the door, I think ; did you knoAV me? I couldn't tell. You hardly looked as if you did.\" He looked keenly at her, as the colour seemed to cover neck and throat as well as face. \" Yes. Your brother Avas speaking to you,\" she replied. It was a strange tone in which she spoke. He looked at her for a moment, as if surprised. \" Ellen ! It is a long time. Are you then changed \u2014 as much changed as they say you are ? \" \" Yes ; I am changed, I believe. Three years \u2014 for it is that time, I think \u2014 three years will bring change.

There is room, I am sure.\" She took his arm without speaking. As they reached the door, Mrs. Hay met them. \" Ah ! my dear Granville, that is right ; I Avas coming to see if this poor creature Avouldn't have something to eat after all her exertions. A perfect opera dancer ! The evening is going off well, Ellen, dear. But I always say Colonel Ray*mond under stands the secrets of a dance. Ah! he was a very favourite partner when he was some years younger ; but I Avon't detain you : yet, if I may, I Avill return with you, for to say truth I have not had any thing, and should like just a jelly.\" \" Will you take my other arm ? \" asked Granville, and they went on a step or two. \" There is not room,\" said Ellen, coldly, and with drawing her hand from his arm. \" I don't Avish for any supper, and had rather remain here.\" He looked at her earnestly, as if seeking to read the meaning of her changed voice. But though she blushed as she felt his eyes bent on her in inquiry, she did not meet the look, and turned away, leaving them to proceed together. Granvdle sighed a little. \" Poor young thing, poor girl ! \" said Mrs. Hay, \u2014 and Ellen heard her, for she had taken a seat near"], [74, "62 UPS AND DOWNS. the door \u2014 \" her temper is much changed, of late. So much admiration and positi\\*e worship is bad for her. I sadly fear she wid be spodt. You men are sad hands at flattery,\" she said, playstdly, \" and forget Avhat poison it is to some minds.\" Ellen heard no more, for they had edged on through the croAvd, and in a moment her attention was claimed by some girls Avho returned from the supper-room. She rose wearily, suppressed a yawn, and then, Avith a sudden effort, she entered into the laughing and badinage Avhich Avas going on among the young people. Captain Breton claimed her promise, and she spun round with him till she could not go on any longer. \" What ! Ellen Raymond tired, given up before any one else ! \" exclaimed Miss Taylor, as she passed Avith her partner. \" I must own I am tired, for a wonder,\" she said ; hut she kept up the ball and returned joke for joke with her partner. \" Miss Raymond, may I have the next dance ? \" asked GranA'ille, standing someAvhat behind her chair. \" I have just refused Mr. Lupton. Excuse me, Mr. Mortimer, but I am tired,\" she said, laying a slight stress on the \" Mr. Mortimer.\" \" You do dance, then ? I thought, and so did Alick, from your"], [75, "THE COLONEL'S BALL. 63 face, that you were condemning us all as so many fools just noAV.\" \"I am very fond of a really good waltz,\" he answered in a dry, quiet Avay. * There is your sister Rosamond, sitting out ; she is a pretty dancer to look at, though Alick says, heaA-y in hand.

But did that mean, being translated, ' I Avant to get rid of you ? ' \" \" I must leave the translation to you, if my words need any: you must be an accomplished linguist, now.\" There was an eA-ident effort to make the tone indifferent, but it was haughty and betrayed annoy ance. He did not move aAvay, but neither did he speak again. Very soon one of the \" red-coats\" came up and began to talk of a concert which was advertised to take place at Poole in a short time. At first Ellen gave short ansAvers, then her brother in-law dreAV near, greeting her with a nod, and \" Hallo, Ellen, it is a neAV thing to see you sit out, while dancing is going on ; but you and Alick go at such a confounded pace, no wonder you're knocked up.\" She boAved and turned immediately with anima-"], [76, "64 UPS AND DOWNS. tion and interest to the officer, discussing the merits of the performers, and quizzing a certain female singer who Avas to appear. When all this laughing and joking was ended, and the gentlemen had taken leave with an expression of regret at being obliged to depart so soon, she looked round ; but Granville was gone, nor did she see him again that night. The wax-lights Avere burnt out, the lamps w-ere dim, the musicians were putting up their instru ments, and every one was gone \u2014 all but a few select intimates, who remained to the last, and were noAV talking over the evening. Mrs. Hay, John Mortimer, and Bessie Avere praising the spirit of the dancing, and the excellent music which the Colonel had taken trouble to procure. He received these com pliments in a dignified hut pleased manner, and said, if there had been success, it was all owing to that lady, bowing to Mrs. Hay ; \"and this little lady, too, really did the honours A'ery well,\" he added, with a patronizing smile and patting Bessie's shoulder. \" I wish I could say my other daughter did me the same credit,\" the Colonel added, looking round at Eden ; avIio, however, might be supposed not to hear, for she held her fan before her face, and was apparently listening to some fareAvell whispers from Alick Hay : he had returned after seeing the Miss Taylors off, and now stood with his large cloak hanging OA'er one shoulder, and his cap in his hand \u2014"], [77, "THE COLONEL'S BALL. 65 the very beau ideal of a youthful lover.

CHAPTER IV. THE DAY AFTER THE BALL. \" Here he comes *ivith your niece.\" Ellen Raymond was in her own room. A bright fire was blazing, and threw a cheerful appearance over the neatly arranged furniture. The young girl did not appear at all like the same brilliant, animated creature that she had been during most of the evening. There was no conscious smile curling her lips; no pleasing dreams, apparently, such as young maidens sometimes indulge in after a ball. But an expression of pain, with now and then a frown of anger and a flash of the eyes, telling of a defiant, haughty spirit. Over all, in her bent posture and her drooping arms, was a shade of weariness \u2014 not only of body but of the mind. No tears softened or dimmed her deep chestnut-coloured eyes. She gazed intently into the fire. Then turn ing round with a sudden movement she looked up at a portrait on the wall, and gave a long gasping sigh. A low knock and a timid, \" May I come in ? \" caused her to rise from her seat and begin unfastening her sash and bracelets."], [79, "THE DAY AFTER THE BALL. 67 \" Lily, what can keep you so late ? You ought to have been at home hours ago.\" \" I did go home, and then \u2014 somehow, I couldn't help thinking of your face \u2014 it was looking so tired, Miss Ellen, as you came out into the hall. I told uncle, ' Really I must go back and see how Miss Raymond is ; I fear she is not well.' Are you ill ? \" she added, giving her help in disarraying her friend. \" Now you are here, you must stay all night ; or rather till daylight, for it is morning already. Nurse can give you part of her bed.\" \" Thank you, miss. Uncle wiU be uneasy, for I took away the house door key.\" \"Well, Lily, were you pleased? Who did you admire the most? Was not Miss Rosamond Mor timer splendid?\" \" Yes, very. But I admired your sister the most of all, Miss Ellen. I always think of those lines you read to me once about Christabel, when I see her. I can fancy her kneeling at the oak tree, and all.\" \" What a girl you are about poetry, Lily. Take care and don't grow too fond of it.\" \" I do love it. But what harm will it do ? \" \"Make this hfe \u2014 real life, very, very dry and ugly \u2014 uglier than it is already ! \" said Ellen. Lily coloured up, and observed shyly, that she wondered such as Miss Raymond could find it ugly, with so much that was beautiful at com- F 2"], [80, "68 UPS AND DOWNS. mand \u2014 music and dancing, and so many admiring her. \"Indeed! I see your head \u2014 your silly little head is turned by all you have seen to-night. Now Lily, pray, don't give them cause to say I have ruined you.\" \" You, Miss Ellen, who \" \" Yes ; by improper teaching, unfitting you for your own station. That's what is said, Lily; so take care.\" The girl pouted a little, and looked annoyed. Soon, however, she smiled again, while smoothing out Ellen's rich hair, on which the blaze was brightly reflected, and which fell into waves as it was pulled out of its confinement and covered her shoulders, reaching far below her waist. \" How well Mr. John Mortimer looks when he is dancing, Miss Ellen ; though I don't mean, of course, to compare him with young Mr. Hay : some think him handsomer, but I don't. I couldn't imagine,\" she went on, finding Ellen not disposed to answer ; \" I couldn't make out who Mr. Gran ville was at first. I thought I knew his face, and yet couldn't make him out, till I heard the servants talking of him. Do you think he is handsome, Miss Ellen ? I thought at first he was not like the other Mr. Mortimer, he looked so dull and grave ; but afterwards, when he was walking about the hall with his sister Miss Rosamond, I could see"], [81, "THE DAY AFTER THE BALL. 69 him quite plain, and his eyes seemed beautiful. He looked down upon her with such pride and love. And once he smiled, and then it was just like the sun on the water. And I thought his voice had such a pleasant sound, so feeling, and yet as if there was much more feeling he wouldn't let out.\" \" Upon my word, Lily, you grow eloquent, and must have given a good share of observation to this gentleman. I hope he did not see you staring at him.\" \" Oh, Miss Ellen ! He didn't see me at all, except just when I fetched Miss Rosamond's cloak, and then he spoke quite like a gentleman to me, and thanked me. But don't you think he is very \u2014 well, perhaps not handsome exactly, but very well looking?\" \" Oh, I am tired \u2014 tired to death, Lily,\". Ellen answered, yawning, but evading the girl's question. \" Eoll up my hair there 's a good girl, and get away to bed.\" \" Before I can sleep I must have it out in some way,\" said Ellen, speaking to herself; and unlocking her desk, she opened a manuscript book and began to write. She had some odd fancies ; one of them was, every now and then, when under a strong impulse or pressure of excitement, she relieved herself by writ ing ; not in exactly a journal (at least, she did not call it so) but imaginary letters to her mother \u2014 her"], [82, "70 UPS AND DOWNS. dead mother ! The love had been very strong between them, and since she had been taken, her daughter had not entirely opened her heart to any one. It is to be doubted whether, had Mrs. Raymond been still alive, her child's heart would have con tinued to be entirely unfolded to her ; but it was a comfort and pleasure to do so in fancy, and this was what she did now. \"It is over, mother !

Oh, yes ; I read through her hypocritical manner : of course, she will strive heaven and earth to keep him from me. Will he heed her ? What coidd make him so stern, so cold, so self-possessed, so accusing ? Let me think ! I suppose he was angry at my laughing and talking so much to Alick ; or rather why should I think he cares enough to be angry or even observe it ? Three years !

Very dazzling and beautiful was that winter morn ing ; but Ellen was not there to admire and long, as she always did, to be able to draw it. She slept so soundly that, late as it was, the nurse left the room two or three times without having the \"heart to disturb her,\" as she said to the Colonel. \"Very inconvenient,\" he answered. \"I wanted her on business. But you may tell Miss Raymond I shall not return now till dinner-time.\" Ellen crept down-stairs rather ashamed of her laz\\* fit. But there was no one to see her. The"], [85, "THE DAY AFTER THE BALL. 73 little girls were occupied with their daily governess. One or two cards were lying on the table, \" Mrs. Hay;\" \"Miss Mortimer;\" \"Mrs. Taylor.\" \" Thank goodness ! \" she exclaimed, turning them over. \" What an escape ! and now, if I could get out for a walk, I should escape the other callers. But it's cold, and who can I find for a companion ? \" While she was considering, standing at the window, with her eyes fixed on a robin who fluttered very near pecking the crumbs always thrown for him and his fellows, a loud double rap warned her that she was too late to avoid morning visitors. It proved to be Dr. and Miss Moore. Ellen received them graciously and with a quiet wellbred ease, which caused Dr. Moore to remark after wards to his sister he couldn't understand what people meant by finding fault with Miss Raymond's manners; he thought them so very graceful and pleasing. j- They talked in a pleasanter strain than often happens in a formal call, and while they were so occupied, no one of the party heard the door bell, and they were consequently surprised by the entrance of Mr. Granville Mortimer and a lovely little girl, his niece. Ellen forgot to be cold and resentful. She had no time to remember her annoyance, and it seemed only natural to hold out her hand and be glad to see him. He also smiled a little, and he looked inquiringly"], [86, "74 UPS AND DOWNS. at her as, sriU retaining her hand, he said, \" Are you well \u2014 recovered ? \" \"I was not ill! There was nothing to recover from,\" she said, and then she caught up the little child and kissed her many times. \"Bonnie Lisa! are you come to see Aunt Nelly ? And only think of your bringing her ! Did you come without a servant ? All in the snow too. Why, Lisa, wasn't it up to your knees ? \" she said, taking off the little bonnet and pulling out the soft light hair, fondly and proudly. \" Uncle Gran carried Lisa,\" the child said, and sliding off her aunt's knee, she ran towards some thing which attracted her notice. \"Are you fond of children?\" Miss Moore asked of Granville. \" Not in general ; indeed, I don't remember caring for any but these two.\" \" Well ! y*ou will be a blessing, indeed, to Bessie, if yon will act nurse sometimes,\" said EUen. \" For my part, I can't pretend to like them, beyond seeing them for a short time when they are dressed in their best. I have no fancy for dirty fingers, and soiled pinafores and squalling, and such like troubles. But, Lisa, when in a good humour and clean, is very tolerable. She is not ugly, is she, Miss Moore ? though she is not ' a Mortimer,' and therefore, of course, said to he not nearly so handsome as her little sister.\""], [87, "THE DAY AFTER THE BALL. 75 Miss Moore smiled. The harsh, bitter shade which always came over Ellen's voice when speaking of the Mortimers, amused Miss Moore, and rather puzzled her. She observed that Lisa was like her mother, rather \u2014 the eyes were like. \"Well, she can't take after a better model; at least so I think,\" remarked Granville, but in a low voice. \" Of course you admire her ? \" said Miss Moore, looking at him. \" I do. Yet, in spite of Miss Eaymond's hard hit, I confess I think there is more promise of real beauty in the httle baby. Such splendid eyes she has ! \" \" And Lisa is not splendid at all, and never will be ! \" exclaimed Ellen, again taking her up and gazing into the child's soft face. \" Lisa is a little bud \u2014 a blossom, lovely, and soft, and sensitive. You are no staring sunflower, my precious, are you? \" Here Dr. Moore reminded his sister that he had an engagement and they both were to go. But first, Miss Moore asked if Ellen would join their party in the evening. Her brother had one or two gentlemen coming to dinner, and she should be so glad if she would bring her work and keep her company either for dinner or afterwards. EUen hesitatingly said she ought to be writing some long neglected letters, and perhaps her father would not like her going. \" Surely the letters can"], [88, "76 UPS AND DOWNS. wait till to-morrow,\" observed Granville, carelessly, and playing with his little niece's hair. \" I did ask Colonel Eaymond to give us the pleasure of his company, but he said he was en gaged,\" said Dr. Moore. \" So, Miss Eaymond, you have no excuse ! \" exclaimed Miss Moore, at the same time shaking hands. \" Thank you ! I should like it well ; but, indeed, I must not say yes, till I have seen my father \u2014 will you let me leave it dependent on that ? I will write if he says no.\" \" I shall expect you. And bring some music,\" said Miss Moore. \" Your father will be at my aunt's, I suspect,\" re marked Granville, when they were alone and he had shut the door on the visitors. \" My sisters and, I think, John and his wife, are to be there. I supposed y*ou were to be of the party ; but I am glad not.\" \" I had not heard of it. But she \u2014 Mrs. Hay, has been here to-day \u2014 before I was down-stairs, I am ashamed to say.

They appear to be sensible people, and wdl prove an acquisition.\" \" To me she is a very great gain. But I hardly expected y*ou to praise them ! \" said Ellen."], [89, "THE DAY AFTER THE BALL. 77 \" Why so ? Because it is supposed he will rob John of a few patients ? I see no cause for alarm. I am sure, even from John's confession, Dr. Moore is a strictly honourable man. He has an indepen dent income, and, moreover, only acts as consulting physician. It will do John good. He would rust in his easy monopoly. Now Dr. Moore, being a reading and a clever man, will spur John up.\" \" Yes, spur him up to quarrelling \" but no sooner had the w*ords escaped than she repented them and blushed violently. He looked at her, but made no remark. When next he spoke, his voice was constrained and cold, and immediately her \" touch and go\" spirit, as Mrs. Hay called it, fired up, and she remembered her resolve of last night. \" Have you not been oufTthis morning?\" Granville asked. \" No. It seems so cold.\" \" Cold, but very clear and bright. You used to be fond of fresh fallen snow in sunshine.\" \" Was I ? Yes ; I believe I was,\" and she sighed a little. \"Do you see much of these little things?\" he asked, presently, and trying to put on Lisa's bonnet, which, however, he did not succeed in very well. Ellen relieved him of the task, laughing a little, rather a forced laugh, at men's awkwardness. \" I shall learn now \u2014 Lisa and Uncle Gran are great"], [90, "78 UPS AND DOWNS. allies already. She is your favourite, I see. What an interest they must be to you ! Our little nieces ! \" He smiled as he emphasised the pronoun, and when he looked up at her as she stood stiU arranging the bonnet on Lisa, who was on her uncle's knee, the hard line her lips had formed trembled into a half smile, and she blushed as she said, in a tone partly sorrowful and self-blaming, partly proud and wilful : \"As I said before, I don't love children except under certain conditions, and these conditions Bessie's brats seldom offer. I am a shocking bad aunt \u2014 eh, Lisa ? \u2014 I see you are going to be a model uncle.\" \" Is she your godchild ? \" he asked, patting Lisa's fair cheeks and looking at her instead of at Ellen. \"No.\" \"Baby, then?\" \" No ; I refused ! You look astonished and shocked. They paid the compliment of asking Mrs. Hay and myseU for this one ; the other has your two sisters, I believe. I have no vocation for sponsor-hood any more than aunt-hood ! \" He rose to leave, without saying a word in reply. Taking her hand, he seemed about to speak seriously, for his earnest eyes questioned her countenance, and a smile just rose in them, but had not time to reach the lips when another thundering rap at the door startled them both. He dropped her hand, and"], [91, "79 THE DAY AFTER THE BALL. bowing, said, \" I must go ! \" \u2014 The door opened very wide, and two of the Kirkcross officers entered, swords and spurs rattling and astonishing the timid little Lisa, who hid behind Ellen's dress and just peeped forth at the terrible strangers. Granville bowed again gravely, and calling Ids niece, left the room. Visitors, both gentlemen and ladies, kept Ellen to her post, till she was weary of hearing the previous evening canvassed and praised. It was dark, and stiU her father had not returned. She did not know what to do about the Moores, and feeling stupid and disinclined for occupation, she took up a book of poetry as an excuse for enjoying her favourite easy lounging chair."], [92, "80 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER V. FROST AND SNOW. It was too dark even to pretend to read, and Ellen was leaning back against the silken cushions and gazing with a dreamy eye on the fire, apparently forgetful of time and darkness, her father's late appearance, or her own uncertainty about going to Dr. Moore's. Soon the door opened. \" Ellen, are you there ? \" \" Yes, papa ! \" starting up. \" How very late \u2014 I mean, I was wishing to see you ; for, if you have no objection, I will spend the evening with Miss Moore.\" \" Miss Moore ! Mrs. Hay wished you to accom pany me. She was here this morning about it herself, but you were not down. She was very kind. I consider it most generous and forgiving in her, after your open, impertinent wilfulness and opposition to her known wishes last night \u2014 I say, it was kind of her to invite you.\" And the Colonel took up his position, back to the fire and facing his daughter, on whom the blaze flickered and trembled, revealing a very different countenance"], [93, "FROST AND SNOW., 81 from the one which so softly and quietly smiled and dreamt a few moments before. \"I am much obliged to her, but I must decline the honour \u2014 my absence can only be acceptable and desired, I am sure.\" \" But suppose I bid you go ? \" \" For what purpose, papa ? To spoil the evening for all the party ? \" she asked. \" No ; but to break that high and stubborn will. But since I believe that you would give your right hand to be there, in spite of your tragedy-air refusal, I shan't press the matter. His mother has spoken very seriously to Alick to-day ; and, Ellen, I believe the poor lad is fond of her and means well. How can you dare to tempt him to disobey his mother ? You were the talk of the room ! \u2014 positively-, a sub ject in every one's mouth ! A pretty pass for my daughter to come to ! It must and shall be put an end to!\" \" I think I understood that you were going to dine at Mrs. Hay's ? \" Ellen asked, after a silence. \" Yes. But before I go to dress, I have something to say. Give your attention, if you please. Well ! I have decided on the children's going to school. A great expense, no doubt; but they need better teaching than Poole affords. And \u2014 and, circum stances render it advisable, in fact. I am sure,\" he went on, his voice growing irritable as he pro ceeded, \" there is no good example here for them. vol. i.

Why I speak to you is \u2014 is \u2014 I wish you to look at their wardrobe, and consult with nurse to provide everything necessary for a year's absence, for they are to remain at school a whole year. You understand ? \" \" Yes. Where ? \u2014 what school is it to be ? \" \" Mrs. Harding kindly consents to receive them. I heard from her to-day,\" he answered, and he felt in his pocket for the letter. \" Mrs. Harding ! Hetty and Ruth go there \u2014 to Lansdowne Villa ? \" exclaimed Ellen, in great excitement. She rose from her seat and came up close to her father, looking eagerly at him, as she spoke. He in return stared at her, and then frowned. He crossed his arms, and then said deliberately and coldly \u2014 \" To Mrs. Harding's, Lansdowne Villa. No wonder you are a little surprised. It is, indeed, very good of her to receive them, or any one of the name of Raymond.\" \" Father,\" she said, clasping her hands together, \" don't let them go there : don't ! Consider Hetty's temper and disposition, and poor, poor Ruth. She is so delicate, so very sensitive. There ? no ! they must not go. Papa, you won't send them there, will you? \" \" What is all this about ? Can you pretend for one moment that you have any right to throw this doubt and slur on Mrs. Harding's school ! You, who"], [95, "FROST AND SNOW. 83 brought ruin and disgrace to her very door ! Yet \u2014 you may see for yourself the kind terms she makes use of; so delicately* passing over all that affair, not saying one word about it. You see I have heard \u2014 I know.\" \" Yes \u2014 so you said the other day,\" she answered, in a low subdued manner, with her head quite bent down, so that he could not see her face. \" Mrs. Harding has the reputation, well earned, of being a most kind and careful governess. My sole objection was the expense, which she kindly, for the sake of old acquaintance with your mother, reduces so as to enable me to meet it. She is not to be held answerable for all that wilful girls choose to do. Perhaps you think she is ? \" he added, as he stirred the fire. \" I think \u2014 I know, if I had a child of my own I had rather she could neither read nor write, than go there. I don't \u2014 I can't lay all my sins upon her ! No ! father, I don't do so. But \u2014 if you only knew \u2014 if you would believe me now, when I assure you, that the whole system from first to last is had \u2014 very bad for one hke me and one like Hetty. It is fostering love of display and admiration \u2014 working on one's very faults ! Yes, father, I might never have \u2014 But I can't talk of it ! Only, don't \u2014 don't send them there ! \" \" Because she provides a charming garden, taking care that the wall is defended too, I suppose she 0 2"], [96, "84 UPS AND DOWNS. is to be blamed if a girl, old enough to know better, takes it into her head to have moonlight walks there with a low designing fellow.\" \" And who \u2014 who \u2014 allowed that ' low designing ' man to have free entrance at all hours \u2014 to be with his pupils alone \u2014 to sing with them at parties ? Who saw it? and used any \u2014 any- little liking between masters and pupils for her own purpose? Aye, encouraged it ! I say ! \" \u2014 she continued, with vehe mence. \" The whole system is bad. Some may escape; but others \u2014 others fall into the snare. Especially \u2014 especially- \u2014 if there is \u2014 no \u2014 no mother \" Her voice sank, and was at last smothered by a sob. \" Now you have had your say, listen to me, Ellen ! I think you have added to your fault ten degrees, by the ungrateful, untrue way in which you have tried to shift the blame from yourself to Mrs. Harding. Your excited words, however, have not the slighest influence on my decision. Hetty and Ruth must be ready in a fortnight ! And now I will leave you, for it is time to dress for dinner.\" \" If I could but make you understand and see. But it is no use \u2014 no use ! This is ' her ' doing again, I know! I give it all up.

Oh mamma, would you were but here ! \" * * # # # Colonel Raymond looked in again for a moment, muffied up in his cloak and comforter. \" Ellen ! AVhat in the world does the girl sit there for without lights \u2014 doing nothing ? Ellen, are you asleep ? \" \" No, papa ; I hear.\" But she hardly even turned her head towards him. She was still standing before the fire, leaning against the chimney-piece. \" I wish to say that the little girls, Hetty and Ruth, are not to be told about this plan. I am advised : \u2014 Mrs. Hay thinks it is wiser to say nothing till the time comes ; the day before they leave, perhaps. She is kind enough to say she will take them to B and see and speak to Mrs. Harding about my views and wishes, and mention any little particulars respecting Ruth's health. Do you under stand ? you are not to say a word to them.\" The next moment she heard the front door bang, and Robert came in to ask if she was going to dine at home. \" Yes \u2014 that is, no : I want no dinner, thank you, Robert.\" She went up into her own room, and when there, gave vent to some of the deep vexation she felt, by walking rapidly to and fro, and now and then exclaiming to herself, \" Going with them ! of course,"], [98, "86 UPS AND DOWNS. to hear all, and more than all. Well, what matters ! things cannot be worse. Only if she knows \u2014 if she gets hold of such a treasure as that will be against me \u2014 she will make good use of it. Oh, how glad I am, that long ago, in days of happy confidence and friendliness, I myself spoke of that odious affair. At least I said something, and he stopped me, smiling at me. He said \u2014 oh I remember it well \u2014 ' You are frank enough, Ellen, at all events,' and then he abused girls' schools roundly.\" By degrees her steps sobered into a slower and quieter pace, and when she sat down, she leant quite back in the chair, her eyes fixed on the wintry sky, the hurrying race among the clouds, and the contrasting quietude of the small crescent moon, and one bright star. She could also see the street Ughts above the garden shrubs, sufficiently distant to look pretty, particularly in contrast with the snowy ground. There had been a good fire when she came up, but it soon died away ; yet Ellen neither stirred to light her lamp, or to renew the fire. She did not once move till Hetty came into the room. \" Quite dark ! Ellen, Ellen, where are you? You are to go down-stairs directly, Mr. Mortimer is there waiting for you.\" \" Mr. Mortimer waiting for me ! which Mr. Mortimer ? What time is it? \" \"How am I to answer a dozen questions in a breath ? \" laughed Hetty. \" But your hair is half-"], [99, "FROST AND SNOW. 87 down, Nelly, and you have been napping I suspect. It is the new Mr. Mortimer, the very grave man, and he is like a Russian with his fur cloak. He said \u2014 I heard him speaking to Robert \u2014 he said he was sent to fetch you somewhere.\" \" Dear me ! I entirely forgot all about going to the Moores. Stir the fire, Hetty dear, will you ? \" and Ellen hastened away. \"Miss Moore, having had no note or message, hopes you are coming ; we waited dinner for some little time : Miss Moore bade me say she could take no excuse. I was to bring you and your music \u2014 and there was some postscript to the effect of not minding your dress, which I conclude you will understand.\" GranviUe said this while standing hi the hall, where Eilen had found him. She uttered some broken excuses for her utter forgetfulness, adding, that her father had been talking to her about something which had occupied her mind ever since. She had quite forgotten what time it was, and everything else. \" Well, I hope at least the ' something' was pleasant, since it was such an engrossing subject,\" he observed with a grave smile. \"Now, wiU you cloak yourself? It is very cold 1 will wait here, thank you,\" he said, as she opened the drawing room door and exclaimed at there neither being lamp nor fire."], [100, "88 UPS AND DOWNS. \" Unless you can trust me to look over and choose out your music,\" he added. Ellen told Hetty, who now came downstairs, to get a candle, and saying that she would not keep him long, she ran to put on her bonnet and cloak. Though told that no \" dressing,\" was required, she ventured to keep Mr. Mortimer five minutes longer, to enable her to do her hair afresh, and then, merely adding a knot of bright ribbon to her dark purple merino gown (which however was far from un becoming) she put on a wadded hood which she was in the habit of wearing to parties in the town, and was by his side, before Granville had quite made up his mind which songs to take. \" Oh no! not that; I am not going to sing alone; and indeed it is very absurd asking me to sing at all : I don't profess to do so in company.\" He made no answer, but rolled up the music she pointed out, then turned to her with a pleased expression. \" Do you know, I think you are a great favourite of Miss Moore's. She talked of coming herself, fearing, I suppose, that I should prove an unsuccess ful messenger ; but I would not let her : besides the pity it would have been to take her out in the cold, I remembered your peculiarity,\" and an amused smile curled his lip. \" Peculiarity ! what may that be ? \" she answered, as they stepped out on the snow-covered pathway."], [101, "FROST AND SNOW. 89 She was holding up her dress, and also keeping her wrapper tight round her, for the wind blew hard. He hurried after her to open the gate. When they had both passed through, and were on the road leading to the town, she repeated \u2014 \" What can you mean ? \" \" I lost you last night, by the fact of having another lady on my other arm. My aunt said that you would never walk with a gentleman in that way : \u2014 I mean between twO ladies.\" \" Did she say so ? And you believed it, of course ; even remembered it \u2014 an interesting fact, truly.\" \" So much so,\" he answered dryly, \"that I profited by the knowledge ; being wishful not to lose you again, by such inadvertence. You have learnt to be very particular, Ellen. But is it really that you object to the look of the thing, or that three people make conversation dull, generally at least.\" \"You had better ask Mrs. Hay to explain her own assertion. I am far too matter-of-fact to interpret what a person of such very great imagina tion says.\" She even then could not help a little bitterness in her voice ; although as he called her \" Ellen \" for the first time, as he used to do before his absence, her heart had given a sudden bound of pleasure. They went on in silence for a short time, Ellen apparently occupied in picking out her way. \"Take my arm, now, will you?\" he said, turning"], [102, "90 UPS AND DOWNS. hack towards her as she lagged a step or so be- hind. \" You don't seem \u2014 indeed I heard it was so before I returned \u2014 to get on very well with my aunt,\" he presently observed. \" Yet I should have fancied that a friend of her age and experience would be very acceptable. You must indeed miss your best friend \u2014 your mother.\" He pressed her arm very gently, and there was, inexpressible kindness in his voice. \" I do indeed,\" she half whispered ; \" her being taken from us is a mystery to me. \" Do you think that your aunt \u2014 that Mrs. Hay would take her place ? \" she added in a very different tone. \" Certainly not ; no one could do that. Yet \u2014 yes I do wish my aunt had more influence ; that you did her more justice, in fact, than I fear you do.\" \" We had better not talk about this,\" Ellen said in a husky voice, and unconsciously- quickening her pace. \" That is, if you care to be on friendly terms with me ; you know of old that my temper is hot, and I frankly own, there are some subjects I cannot speak of with calmness.\" \" By ' friendly terms,' I am to understand that of mere acquaintance. Our intercourse is to be confined to mere general topics : the weather, for instance?\" he said, getting drier and colder as he went on; his very arm, on which her hand lay,"], [103, "FROST AND SNOW. 91 growing more stiff and rigid \u2014 so much so, that in her instantly offended pride of spirit, she was tempted to pull her hand away. She did make the attempt, but he silently prevented it. \"Is that what you meant, Ellen?\" he asked agam. \" Just as you choose.\" \" What I do mean,\" she added presently, in a softened tone, \" is, that it is no manner of use to preach : I mean \u2014 to tell me how shocked you are, at several \u2014 many things, which I know you will be.

It is well. I might have been tempted perhaps , on the score of old days, to presume a little.\" The sound of his voice, and the clear dry, \" Mor timer,\" way in which each syllable was enunciated, seemed to chill her to the heart. She shivered, but she said nothing. And before they arrived at Dr. Moore's house, a bright crimson colour had flushed all over her face. It was a flush of pride, which increased with every step she took; he preserved a total silence the rest of the way. She was warmly received and"], [104, "92 UPS AND DOWNS. welcomed by Miss Moore, and the evening was full of liveliness and ease. Pleasant conversation, music, and the genial, well-managed warmth and light of the room, combined to mark it as a thoroughly suc cessful little party; as Dr. Moore called it after wards, when speaking of it to his sister. But Ellen Eaymond's cheeks were burning from quite another cause than that of her eager and ani mated argument carried on with Dr. Moore, on the subject of physiognomy. Granville Mortimer's cold, proud and distant manner, whenever he addressed her, and which never for one instant gave way or changed to a gentler tone or a kinder look for the whole of the evening, annoyed as well as saddened her. And he began by being so kind, so much his old self! Why had she spoken so? or rather what had induced him to bring up that one miserable, provok ing subject? that odious, hated name \u2014 just then, too, before she had time to rest upon or realize his regard; before he could observe, and as she had dared to hope from him, perceive something of the difficulties of her position ! Now, she had raised up a stone wall betwixt them, and strengthened and deepened every prejudice or suspicion he might have against her! Such were the thoughts which, amid all the talk ing, rankled in her mind, and gave that hue to her complexion which made her look so beautiful, Miss Moore thought."], [105, "FROST AND SNOW. 93 Granville sang, again and again, \u2014 sang the songs which Miss Moore begged for, and one of which brought something very like a tear in her eye, as Ellen observed.

To Miss Moore his voice often took a softer tone ; and, drop ping his distant, shy or proud manner, he forgot himself in his subject.

Just now it was even gayer than usual, for people were inviting the new comers \u2014 the Moores ; and Granville Mortimer's return to his native town, helped to spur them on. Colonel Raymond and his daughter went every where. His presence was considered an acquisition, from his good looks, his polite manners and even gallantry ; and the kind of traditionary consequence which he contrived to keep up, and with which the Poolites were duly impressed, also added to his popu larity.'

Miss Raymond's beauty and fascination insured her being in request.

Her style of dress was criticised, sometimes as being very expensive and extravagant, considering the reduction of West Indian property, &c, &c. ; sometimes as being so singular ; sometimes as being careless and shabby, because she thought her beauty would stand anything. Criticised as her dress was, it was also sedulously copied. It was even whispered about in the servants' hall at North House, that some ladies had asked Lily Day to try and procure them Miss Raymond's patterns ; as she was known to have the entree of the dressing-room and to act as amateur lady's maid occasionally. At these parties, of course, the Mortimers were alway*s present \u2014 all but Mrs. John, who seldom could be induced to join. Now and then Granville prevailed in coaxing her to go with him ; but then it was remarked that she looked tired and ill, and that she very much neglected her dress: which was rather a matter of wonder, with a husband who was a noted observer and critic of ladies' todettes. He was sure to be at every party, and, married man though he was, continued to be a favourite and favoured partner. No dance was supposed to go off with so much spirit, if any accident prevented John Mortimer from being present. He also acted as steward, or master of the ceremonies, at the public balls and quadrille"], [111, "MR.

Snow and frost still con tinued, with short alternations of rain ; but the seve rity of the weather seemed only to add zest to the meetings. Alick Hay awaited, with praiseworthy patience and resignation, his commission, which every day's post was expected to bring. Mrs. Hay was still at home, the little Raymonds' journey having been put off \u2014 for what reason, unless it were the weather, Ellen knew not ; but she was too glad of any delay to care for the cause. It was the morning after one of the quadrille parties ; to which Mrs. John Mortimer had been induced to go by her eldest sister-in-law, who said it was her duty to go and be seen with her husband sometimes, and that all kinds of gossip was afloat about her seclusion and his gaiety : \" which,\" added Miss Mortimer, \" is not fair to John, so yon must make an exertion and leave your beloved nunnery.\" Miss Mortimer appeared in Park-street just as her brother John had seated himself at table to enjoy his coffee and roll and his newspaper. \" What lazy folks ! \" she exclaimed. \" I have walked as far as the turnpike and back since my breakfast !

Her husband cut short her apolo gies and regrets, by remarking she would have only cold coffee ; but perhaps she preferred it to hot ! He was aware how singular some of her tastes were. \" And,\" he added in that quiet mocking tone which always, more or less distressed and embarrassed her, \" I assure you, Mrs. John, far be it from me to inter fere in any of your likes or dislikes \u2014 only \u2014 even if you do hke cold coffee and stale bread, I should take it as a favour, if I were allowed a table-cloth fit to use.

Her husband's hints about money matters distressed and puzzled her. She sat a long time thinking in what possible manner she could further retrench. She thought that in giving up a respectable and capable nurse and having in her stead a very young and ignorant girl who required to be taught everything, she had made a great saving. But it cost her strength and comfort, for she could not leave her young children to such insufficient care; and yet when she staid at home people said she did very wrongly. Bessie sighed as she bewailed her own want of cleverness. She contrasted herself with her sister Ellen : and that name induced another train of thought and more sorrow.

Bessie refused to believe her husband's reports very often ; but now, during two evenings, she had herself observed him. What could Ellen mean ? There seemed to be no ray of comfort any where. Matters were sadly wrong at her old home, she knew : Mrs. Hay had poured out a long account of the grievances caused by Ellen's faults and neglects at home. Her father's manners towards her had altered : he was grown so very formal ; and John joked and hinted at things she could not under stand at all. Oh, if he would but not joke so on serious things, she could better bear his anger \u2014 even passion ; but that galling irony But she checked herself at this point, and repeated over and over again, that she must be growing fretful and cross to mind her husband's jokes and good spirits: instead of sitting brooding over ills, she ought to be at work. \" What did he mean about the table-cloth ?

It afforded another subject of speculation among the Poole people, that the new comers, supposed to be rivals to John Mortimer's pretensions, were appa rently becoming so intimate with Miss Raymond. But amid all the remark and gossip, no one thought of getting up a love affair between the doctor and Ellen ; though as a widower, with only one Uttle boy who was at school, Doctor Moore might well stand yet in the market matrimoniaL The intimacy seemed confined to the ladies, and so far as advances went, Miss Moore took the lead. Ellen was glad to see her, and sometimes evidently enjoyed her society; but she never did more than accept what was pro posed. Returning a song which had been left for her to try and copy, Miss Moore had taken a brisk turn with Eden in the shrubbery. It was dark before they had observed it, in the eagerness of conversation. \" Thank you, for putting me into a good humour again,\" Ellen said, laughingly ; \" I was very blank when you came. Had it been one of the worthy Poolites, he, or rather she (for I believe men like"], [119, "ADVANCE AND RETREAT. 107 me better than women) she might, with more truth than usual, have gone to abuse me among her neighbours.

Do now-, stay and have tea with us.\" Miss Moore consented, sending word to her brother not to expect her. \" He is an accommodating creature,\" she remarked, as they threw aside bonnets and shawls; \" always content with his books and writing, yet not so wholly engrossed but that he can be sociable too.\" \" You must be happy,\" Ellen observed gravely. \" I sometimes have wished for a brother : yet \" \" I imagined a sister's husband would stand for one.\" Ellen gave an impatient exclamation ; then, push ing back her hair, which she was in the act of twisting behind her ears when Miss Moore spoke, she said: \u2014 \" Miss Moore, I thought you never made common place matter of course speeches ! Or \u2014 could it have been curiosity? Don't you really know that my sister's husband is no brother to me ? \" \"WeU, I thought \u2014 I fancied \u2014 in fact, I was not quite sure. But it must be very trying to you, living so near too.\""], [120, "108 UPS AND DOWNS. \" Oh ! \" said Ellen, \" for that matter, I don't allow neighbourhood to try me. But I want you to look at this : what do you think of it ? \" And she held a candle before a chalk drawing. \" A very lovely woman ! What eyes ! Are they real eyes ? \u2014 I mean, really like any one's ? \" \" Very, very like,\" and Ellen sighed softly. \" That is my friend \u2014 my one, my only friend. She was my mother's companion and friend when they were girls : she, Mrs. Wentworth, w*as by a few years the younger. I am glad you admire her.\" \" And is that the lady with whom you are going to stay ? \" \" Yes ; when she returns home, I am to go. She has been abroad for more than two years, and won't return till milder weather comes. She Uves near our old estate. I have not been there since I was a child : I am longing for the time ! \" The two young women drew in their chairs to the fire and were in full chat, Miss Moore busy with some \"idle work\" but Ellen preferring a lazy, enjoyable fireside \"confab,\" as she called it, when footsteps were heard in the hall, and the Colonel soon ushered in two gentlemen. \" I have brought two young men in to taste your tea, Ellen, and Mr. Granville Mortimer has brought some sketches, very kindly. Ring the bell for the tray, I am cold and hungry.\" \" Where did you meet papa ? \" asked Ellen of"], [121, "ADVANCE AND RETREAT. 109 Alick, as he followed and helped her in arranging tea and coffee cups, the others still lingering near the fire. \" I was returning from a walk with Gran, when Colonel Raymond overtook us ; he drew in and rode by our side. Gran spoke of pictures and scenery, and got invited here \u2014 and so did your humble servant: but he hummed and hawed a little over it, and my mother will query the move, I guess.\" He laughed gaily. Ellen remained grave and abstracted. \" What is the matter, Nelly ? You don't seem over pleased with y*our company,\" he said, presently. \" No, indeed ! Miss Moore and I had planned such a cosy evening ! and we were so comfortable and \" \" Confidential ! Ah, how I wish I could over hear some of those women's confidential talks. I can guess pretty well, though, what you have been saying \u2014 eh, Nelly ? \" \" Hand the tea and be quiet. I say to you what our French governess used to say to us \u2014 Sois sage ! sois sage, Alick ! \" When they were seated, Colonel Raymond asked Granville if the party at his house was to be dancing or musical. Granville said he didn't know : in fact, he had forgotten there was to be a party at all. Then he remarked how very gay Poole had become ; Miss Moore assented and praised the"], [122, "110 UPS AND DOWNS. society, which the Colonel allowed was very credit able for a country town. Alick tried to keep up a whispering and laughing conversation with Ellen, hut she would not allow it. Then he began to joke with Hetty, who with her sister had joined them. Ruth sat as close to Ellen as she possibly could, and listened with quiet and absorbed admiration to Hetty's ready replies, wondering exceedingly how she could contrive to answer even Mr. Granville Mortimer without the slightest awkwardness or blush. When the table was cleared, the Colonel produced the portfolio of prints which he had spoken of. Gran ville drew his chair to the table and examined the engravings ; Alick suffered himself to be coaxed into a game of chess with Hetty, thinking her a very pretty girl ; and he showed it enough in his manner to add a sparkle to her eye and an air of gratifi cation to her manner. The pale shy httle Ruth looked on. Miss Moore and Ellen were again together, having seated themselves on a couch midway between the table and the fire. \" I told you, I think,\" Miss Moore was saying, \"of my cousin being engaged for ten years, and of her astonishing spirit, which never seemed to flag once.\" \" Yes ; well ! Has she given up at last, or has the gentleman grown weary ? \" asked Ellen."], [123, "ADVANCE AND RETREAT. 111 \" On the contrary ; he is returned from Australia a rich man, and I am bidden to the wedding, which is to be in a month.\" \" And he actually remained true and faithful all that time! Five years, I think you said, he had been absent from her \u2014 what a trial ! \" \"I? absence est a l'amour, ce qu'est au feu le vent. II eteint le petit, il allinne le grand\" said Granville, turning towards them and looking at Miss Moore. \"Yes : \" she replied. \" I suppose it is so.\" \" Oh, yes ;\" observed Ellen, in a manner meant to be light and indifferent, but which had nevertheless a troubled tone : \" Oh, yes ; absence does no harm. It is presence that destroys the charm ! \" No one answered her; but Miss Moore gave a glance of surprise, and Granville again bent over the prints. Ellen twisted some flowers she held, till they fell into pieces, and then she laughed. \" Nevertheless, I hope to disprove my own asser tion : I hope soon to meet my friend who has been aw*ay for two years. I don't think I shall care for her the less when I find myself with her, and looking in her beautiful face ; and moreover, I don't think she wiU hate me ! It is pleasant,\" she added, in the same light, half-joking way, and turning to Miss Moore, \" It is pleasant to feel that there is one person in the world who will be just : even perhaps a httle partial and indulgent. Do you ever wish you were a baby again, Miss Moore ? \""], [124, "112 UPS AND DOWNS. \" I can't say I do,\" laughing. \" Indeed, I am one of those exceptional cases, who do not look back on childhood as the happiest time. I did not find mine so. I pity poor children intensely-; they are often much tried.\" \" Of course it all depends on circumstances. But I know I never now see a baby in its mother's arms without But you can't see, Miss Moore,\" she added, changing her manner and tone abruptly. \" Shan't we have some music ? \" she added, rising and moving across the room hurriedly. \" You will play, Miss Moore, won't you?\" And she came back to the couch. \" I had rather not,\" answered Miss Moore, quietly ; on which Ellen sat down again. \" What a singularly interesting countenance your little sister has,\" she presently remarked. \" The pale one I mean : the youngest, I believe ? They make a pretty contrast too. Do y*ou think her at all like your elder sister, Mrs. John Mor timer ? \" \" What, Ruth ? well \u2014 perhaps she may be \u2014 in some way. But Ruthy will hardly be as pretty as Bessie was. She is wretchedly shy : it is her greatest -her one fault.\" \" Fortunate, if she has no worse fault than that. Don't you like to see a child shy ? or rather, dislike the utter want of the seeling ? \" \" No ; I dislike all shyness ; I believe, I have no"], [125, "ADVANCE AND RETREAT. 113 sympathy with, or pity for it. I confess I never knew the feeling.\" \" Some persons say that it is all pride,\" observed Miss Moore. \" But that rule certainly has many exceptions : I have known shy people, the very reverse of proud or conceited.\" \" Have you ? The shyness I particularly dislike, is a mere mask for a proud self-conceit. Pharisaical in judgment of others \u2014 -I long to pull off the mask, \u2014 so cold, so self-possessed as these so - called shy people are. An honest, frank pride, or honest, straightforward conceit even, I don't mind ; but, when it is shut up in reserve \u2014 frozen up in ice \u2014 oh, I can't abide it ! The very being near such a person, excites my blood to the boiling point.\" Miss Moore smiled over her netting; then observ ing that Granville had risen, and was now turning over music at the pianoforte, she whispered, \" Miss Raymond, you forgot who was so near you. The cap fitted too well : I am sure he heard and did not like it.\" \" Perhaps I didn't forget ! he is welcome, if it fits him.\" \" Do ask him to sing : he excels in that.

She moved hastily, and without a word took her seat at the pianoforte. \" Will you play* that for me ? \" he asked, placing some music before her. \" Impossible ! I can't read well, and I don't know it. I shall spoil your singing, if I try.\" \" You will find yon know it,\" he returned, quietly : \" it is not new to you ; \" and without further answer, she began. \" A little slower, please.\" Ellen coloured up a little and began again. It was a song requiring skill and attention in the accompaniment.

The words, which if translated into plain English might have been pronounced trash, touched the heart of his auditors. Even the merry chess players hushed into perfect silence, and when the last note died away, there was a murmur of thanks and great admiration. \" I am much obliged to you for doing what was so evidently disagreeable to you,\" said Granville in a low voice to Ellen \u2014 a voice how unlike to the one in the song ! That being all love and passionate pleading ; this, being all cold and dry. \" 'Tw*as abominably played,\" she answered, laugh ing, and turning back to the passages in which she had faded. \" That is very intricate time,\" he observed. \" Do you hke the recitative ? \" \" I like it all.

That will give you an idea of her musical capacity- ! \" \" At all events, it shows something still better \u2014 her true wifely love and partiality,\" he answered. \" There 's no doubting that, I believe Poor, foolish Bessie ! \" The last words sank to a whisper, but he heard them, and his smile changed back into his former grave and cold look. \" Pardon me,\" he said, \" but did you say ' foolish' \u25a0 \u2014 did you mean it ? \" \"Yes; I meant it. Isn't it folly \u2014 not wise, to"], [130, "118 UPS AND DOWNS, love any \u2014 any one, as she does. To give all, and get little \u2014 or \u2014 nothing ! \" \" Still, granting even the ' nothing' \u2014 which God forbid be true for her \u2014 still she is happier so, to my thinking. The very power of loving is a blessing bringing its own reward: is it not ?\" His voice was now gentle and earnest ; she looked up again for an instant, and then said, hurriedly : \" I can't tell \u2014 I don't know. To some, perhaps. For such as she is, may be; but for others not. If it is turned back, it is poison \u2014 darkness \u2014 ruin ! \" Her voice sank quite to a whisper, and perhaps he did not catch the last words. Presently he said : \" They are two very sweet children : Lisa especially winds round one. I am proud of my nieces. How is it I never meet you at John's, though I am there every day ? \" \" I don't go often,\" she answered, coldly \u2014 almost in a defying manner. Miss Moore had joined Colonel Raymond nearer the fire, so the two were alone by* the pianoforte. \" I am sorry for it,\" he said, gravely but gently. \" Yet, from what I see of Bessie, she would be glad of her sister. Even while loving her husband and children as she does, her heart is open for others. I don't think her nature can ever mingle or assimi late entirely with my sisters. Don't you think she needs you sometimes ? \""], [131, "ADVANCE AND RETREAT. 119 He looked at her and their eyes again met, for his serious and appealing tone had drawn hers to his face. The feeling with which he spoke made his face absolutely beautiful for the moment, in spite of the irregular features and the red-tinted hair. \" Forgive me, if I speak as \u2014 as I can't quite forget old days. And you know, there is a link \u2014 it seems to give me a kind of claim to something more than cold, formal acquaintanceship, that we both call those children nieces and Bessie \u2014 sister.\" \"I don't know that I have ever denied your claim,\" she replied, tryfing to bring her voice under control; but her fingers were tightly pressed against the pianoforte in the effort to subdue all outward emotion. \" But,\" she went on, \" you must forgive me, when I say that about this \u2014 in this matter, you are, and can be, no judge. Though, of course, I know what hard things are said of me.\" \" I can only judge from what I see,\" he answered. \"I find Bessie sad and tearful, and by dint of putting things together, (never \u2014 understand this \u2014 never by any hint of hers) I feel that she is hurt ; or rather, that she mourns for her old friend, her loved and once loving twin sister.\" \"Oh, but when people marry, they should not want sisters ! It is impossible that it can ever be the same thing. Depend on it, what you think is fretting for me, is only some nursery or domestic"], [132, "120 UPS AND DOWNS. trouble, of which poor dear Bess manages to get her full share.\" Bv striving to make her manner careless and lignt, it became flippant and contemptuous. He made no answer. They both remained silent, not moving, except that Ellen, in an absent way and without any purpose, turned over and back the leaves of the music-book. Very soon he remarked that it was getting late, and he must say, \" Good night.\" She bowed, without speaking; but he held out his hand, and she, blushing, gave hers, saying rather indistinctly : \" I thought the Mortimers never shook hands.\" He smiled slightly, and, bowing to the others, left the room. Almost immediately after, Miss Moore's servant was announced, and she took her leave ; Alick gallantly insisting on accompanying her, though not without a hint from Ellen to that effect. A walk was arranged between the two ladies for the next day, and when they were gone, Colonel Raymond said he was very tired with his long ride and advised Ellen not to sit up, seeing there was to be a party on the next night. She remained, however, indulging in her own thoughts, till old Robert came in and said, \" It was time everything but bats and owls were a-bed.\" He then volunteered, with his grim smile, to remark"], [133, "ADVANCE AND RETREAT. 121 that, \" If Mr. Granville Mortimer hadn't much gift of talking, like Mr. John, no one couldn't deny that he sang finely.\" \" Good-night, Robert,\" said Ellen ; \"I am too sleepy to stay* chattering to-night.\" \" Sleepy be you, miss ? \" he muttered, as he put out the lamp. \" 'Tis a new kind of a sleepiness then. I did think when old friends came back safe from foreign parts, some folks would be more what they used to be ; but it don't seem much good, that I can see, so he may- just take himself off again, as far as my leave goes : don't want no more of the breed. Miss Ellen will match for the credit of the family, if she marry at all : and 'taint every man will venture on the spirit that blazes up in they eyes of hers. She'd better come to me for a character. There 's gunpowder there, not a doubt ; but if folks would be careful, 't would only go off in squibs and crackers, and do no harm.\" Ellen was up-stairs long before this soliloquy was ended. Robert, having lived in the family ever since Colonel Raymond returned to England, considered himself privileged to watch over its interests, and to make his own observations ; which, however, were strictly confined to his own bosom. Robert was a man who indulged in but few words, and hid whatever feelings he had under a sarcastic, dry shrewd manner. He had been, in his own way, fond of Mrs. Raymond ; but it was said, that he did"], [134, "122 UPS AND DOWNS. not care much for the master : holding certain of Ids goings on, in utter contempt. His remarks to Ellen were often amusing to her, showing that he con sidered himself privileged to criticise and even advise. She enjoyed the silent but unmoveable manner in which he resisted all Mrs. Hay's attempts at interference in anything coming under his depart ment. On this point, if on nothing else, he and Ellen had a common feeling, though it was never openly expressed on either side."], [135, "123 CHAPTER VIII. \"IT IS ALL FOR YOUR GOOD.\" Ellen was waiting for Miss Moore, and looking forward to a pleasant walk, for it was one of those rare, lovely days which sometimes light up an English Avinter. A stiff reception, and a frown of annoyance she could not restrain, was given to a Miss Dalton, a young lady who tried very hard to persuade her self and Ellen that they were intimate friends, and whom Robert had shown in now, not aware of Ellen's engagement. Miss Dalton was older than Ellen by some years. She lived with an aunt, on whom she was dependant, and was a useful person in the town ; always at the beck and call of the clergyman, or of any one needing help. She was considered very amiable : just the reverse, in fact, of what Miss Raymond was thought, in Poole ; but singularly, Miss Dalton made a point of seeking Ellen's friendship in every possible way, and contrived whenever she could, to be near her at all the parties ; putting up, it must be con fessed, with many a cold word, or what Alick called a \" snubbing,\" for her pains."], [136, "124 UPS AND DOWNS. \" You are going out, I am sure ! pray, don't let me prevent you !\" exclaimed Miss Dalton, seeing Ellen's bonnet and shawl on. \" Perhaps I should so much enjoy a walk with you. May I ? \" \" Thank you,\" answered EUen, formally, and drawing forward a chair, \" I am engaged already for a walk.\" \" Indeed ! \" and Miss Dalton wondered a little with whom. \" I wished so much to see you : it is always such a treat to me ; but at the last quadrille party I couldn't get near you at all. How very well you looked that night : that soft black lace and the pale, blush wild roses, so exquisitely becoming. Many remarked it! Shall I whisper who ? Among others, Mr. Granville Mortimer ; he admired your choice of colours so much, he said.\" Miss Dalton paused, and after a moment's silence, she said, with a knowing yet confidential smile, \" What very strange things people do say ! What odd upside-down stories they get hold of, to be sure!\" \" Any fresh efforts of imagination going the Poole rounds?\" asked Ellen, scornfully. \" Well ; yes. You know, my* dear, I always like perfect candour between friends, i\" don't like to say one thing behind a person's back and another to her face. You know of old my character for sincerity- and plain speaking.\" \" Well ! Of course you have some very delicious little tit-bit, after that preface. I am eager \u2014 im-"], [137, "\"IT IS ALL FOR YOUR GOOD.\" 125 patient for it. Well ? \" continued Ellen, with flush ing eyes, causing little Miss Dalton to shrink and to hesitate when she spoke. \" I contradicted it, of course. I always fire up in your defence : I become a perfect 'fury*,' as Mr. John Mortimer called me the other day. Can't help it : it is my nature, when I hear my friend abu not quite understood.\" \" Oh, if it was from my brother-in-law \u2014 you need hardly repeat it. Of course that can be of no conse quence : he is privileged.\" \"He would hardly have said what I mean, though he laughed when he heard it. But a laugh often conceals a deeper feeling : no doubt he was hurt and shocked. As for me I determined to tell you ; that at least, you might be on your guard and take care \" She hesitated and tried to catch another glance at the flushed face, which however was hidden from her view. \" What I mean \u2014 what I heard \u2014 from whom is no matter, I suppose ; but it was said : indeed more than one has said it.\" \" Said what? \" exclaimed Ellen, in a tone of impa tient annoyance. \" Don't be hurt or agitated, dear,\" she answered, laying her hand on Ellen's arm : \" don't allow it to distress you ; but it is best to tell the truth \u2014 I should not be the friend I flatter myself I am to you, were I not to tell you what is said.

Mr. Granville Mortimer, naturally ; he is new, and coming from abroad, and his singing \u2014 it all makes people think much of him. Now, you were looking pale and grave, rather out of your usual spirits, in fact, at the quadrille party ; indeed, people say you have been so once or twice before, and it was said \u2014 asserted as a fact \u2014 that it was owing to him ; that there had been an old attachment between you \u2014 and that he has been heard to say 1 deny it all vehe- mently \u2014 so that, you see, people think you are fret- ting for him. I denied it entirely, and said I knew from good authority you were \u2014 in fact, I hinted you were half-engaged elsewhere.\" \" That is not true,\" interruped Ellen. \" Don't blush, dear, I said no harm, trust me ! Miss Mortimer certainly did say in answer to this asser tion, that she didn't quite believe that; but she added, very ill-naturedly (just like her, you know,) that per haps you wish for all the fish in your own net, and grudged even one who would not be caught. Very vulgar, her expressions sometimes are! But she said, she didn't believe^there was, or ever had been, any attachment, certainly not now, on either side.\" \" Quite true,\" said Eden, in a still, subdued voice. \"What else?\" \" Oh, why, it was talked about farther, and she \u2014 the person \u2014 went on to say that she had heard him, Mr. Granville Mortimer, deny, in a scornful way, any truth in the fancy- ; emphatically denying his"], [139, "\"IT IS ALL FOR YOUR GOOD.\" 127 being a ' suitor ' at all.

I have to thank you for my hearing many a bit of Poole opinion. You mean weU ; yet, Miss Dalton, I don't know what good it does, either. However, it teaches me that in Poole, be .one ever so thed, or ever so indisposed for laughing and merri ment, from accidental causes \u2014 such as, a headache perhaps, or a home worry-- \u2014 it won't do to give way. Thank you ! I will be more careful in future.\" \"I fear \u2014 I fear you are displeased,\" said Miss Dalton, in a deprecating manner, trying to take her hand. \"But you must see that it is envy and jealousy which makes you so continually misunder stood : you, who if really known, are so very \" \" So very perfect and amiable,\" repeated Ellen with a toss of her head and a mocking laugh. \" I ought to be very- proud of the constant interest I inspire ; of the perpetual conversation, for which I make subjects.\" \" Well, I won't detain you ! Such a lovely morn ing, everyone ought to be out, I am sure,\" and Miss Dalton rose and said, \" Good-morning.\" She woidd have kissed her, but that Ellen decidedly drew back, and with great ceremony conducted her visitor to the door herself. \" There she goes, to carry this interview, friendly"], [140, "128 UPS AND DOWNS. and confidential, to ever so many houses ! Friend, indeed ! I believed her to be so, or that she wished to be so, once, because she told me such disagreeable things : things I had far better never have heard : they were not intended for my ears.

A CURE FOR THE BLUE DEVILS. \" I AM glad that I happened to come out to-day,\" said Ellen, as they paused to look about and inhale the soft ah*. \" I suppose it is good for one to walk, and to-day it is sweetly soft.\" \" The walks around Poole are very pretty. In summer these lanes must be charming,\" said Miss Moore. \" I don't admire Poole ! I believe my pleasure iu a landscape is all from association. I hate Poole ! When you came to turn me out of my den to-day, I was as low \u2014 as much in the blue devils \u2014 or, perhaps, rather in a horrid bad temper, I should say \u2014 as poor wretch ever was. I am longing for a change \u2014 to get away anywhere ! and to day the post brought me a disappointing letter, for my friend will be detained in Paris, and it must be at least a month before I go.\" \" Why do you hate Poole so ?

For instance, one does not often meet with so clever and agreeable a family as the Mortimers,\" said Miss Moore, rather dryly, and as if expecting an amusing answer. \" Oh, don't talk of them ! I am so tired of the Mortimers : as a family I detest them ! I grant they have gifts \u2014 that family voice, for instance, is won derful ! \u2014 that clear enunciation is a great charm ! \" \" And their singing ? \" interrupted Miss Moore. \" Very fair,\" said Ellen ; \" though the only really cultivated, educated singer is Mr. Granville Mor timer.\" A slight smde dawned for an instant on her features : she was pleased to find how coldly she coidd speak sometimes. \" I agree with y*ou in liking his style the best, \u2014 I hardly know why \u2014 but your brother-in-law sings beautifully, Miss Raymond.\" \"Does he? Oh, Miss Moore! don't let us talk of people : you don't know what a misanthrope I am. It is very heroic of you to venture on a tete-a-tete walk with me. But I warned you before hand how cross and ' ajar' I am.\" She leant back against a gate-post as she spoke and looked wearily on the view before them. The ploughed field into which the gate led, formed a pleasant wavy bit of foregound with its rich brown mould, and a holly-tree stood up sharp and bright from the descending hedge, serving to measure and throw back the distance. The end of the"], [143, "A CURE FOR THE BLUE DEVILS. 131 field was lost in the steepness of the descent ; and then the eye was carried on to brown copse woods, meeting and receding as if the winding river was playing at hide-and-seek in their mossy skirts. Miss Moore had laughed in answer to Ellen's speech, and then they both remained silent. Most persons understand the oppression of a spring day ; particularly, perhaps, those who have any \u2014 the least morbid point in them. There is in spring's budding beauty that undertone of sadness which is usually found mingled with the highest pleasures : and so it should be ! In times of fullest joy, as in hours of heaviest woe, we need to be reminded of our veiled and darkly seeing condition. \" '0 Florence ! with the Tuscan fields and hills, And famous Arno, fed with all their rills ; Thou brightest star of stars \u2014 bright Italy ; Rich, ornate, populous, all treasures thine The golden corn, the olive, and the vine.

Something, 'palace with its storied halls ; Fountains, where love lies listening to their falls.' \" Oh, Miss Moore, do yon ever long and yearn to go to Italy?\" said Ellen.

The two brothers, Cecd and Granvdle Mortimer, were returning from a brisk walk. The countenances of both were lighted up with a certain look of con fidence and affection, independent of the glow caused by exercise. Evidently their animated tete-a-tete had strengthened the old brotherly attachment and admiration the one held for the other.

Cecil was glad to find that three years' experi ence had sobered what he considered some rather wild crotchets of Granville's, and knocked out some of the romance and poetry. His brother's prose writings pleased and astonished him, from the clear ness and nerve in every line. He began to think"], [152, "140 UPS AND DOWNS. that Granville might turn out something better than a mere \"dreamer\" after all, and he brought up the old subject of family dispute \u2014 namely, the living which might have been Granville's, had he not, after passing his degrees, found some troublesome scruples existing, and which no persuasion of his family had succeeded in overcoming. The living was still to be had ; and Granville owned that he had no longer the plea of conscience to prevent his presenting himself for holy orders. But he also told his brother that his mind was pre-occupied : that he was not in that calm, open state, which he thought only a necessary pre paration. On Cecil's pressing the point, and urging that he might control his mind and enforce this calmness \u2014 for what could there be to hinder his leading a perfectly quiet life, and giving himself due time for reflection and thought ? \u2014 GranviUe drew back like a snail to his shell : he was shut up in proof armour from that moment ; and Cecil, after a glance at the changed countenance, respected the feeling.

The Mortimers' house was pecuhar, as Granville had said. It was thoroughly a street house, being a continuation of the Bank budding, and standing in a central situation. It was a substantial, solid piece of masonry with the thick walls of olden times, and well fitting doors and windows. Everything was the perfection of neatness and brightness, from the good sized entrance hall to the back regions. The sitting rooms, except one, looked out on a spacious walled garden, so well contrived with ivy and groups of evergreens, that one forgot it was in the very centre of a town. A grand old mulberry-tree gave a dignity to the level and unshapely lawn : the shape coidd not be altered, so it was wisely retained without an effort to disguise it; but its straight lines were framed or set in bright and gorgeous colours. In summer, it was a show place for choice flowers \u2014 and the colours were arranged by no unskilful hand. No anemones were ever so fine and perfect as those in the one long bed before the drawing-room window in the \" Bank-garden.\" \u2014 Their carnations, chrysanthemums, and geraniums were always the best hi the neighbourhood. For several generations, the love for choice flowers had been a special charac teristic. A Mortimer had introduced dahlias to Poole ; another had spent an almost fabulous sum on Dutch tulips ; nor was Cecil a degenerate son of the"], [155, "THE MORTIMERS. 143 house. A first-rate gardener was employed, and each season yielded its blossoms and kept a perpetual round of varying gem-like beds hi the Mortimers' garden. The garden, too, like the old-fashioned furniture so admirably suited to the house, had a character of its own. It was in fact a Mortimer garden : there was an air of decision and precision about it. The gravel walks so straight, so firm, so smooth ; the walks so solid ; while the very box edging grew up confidently, with no gaps, no fadure of leaf any where : any half-grown, blighted weakling, was im mediately rooted out and cast ruthlessly away. There w*as no tender sickly plant, to be nursed and cherished, with shade and water, and kindly props ; all must, and did, flourish and be strong : each plant was fit for a horticultural show. It might also be observed, that only gay and showy flowers were favourites : violets and lilies of the valley were not to be found. Even myrtle was only tolerated, in indulgence of one of \" Mrs. Mortimer's sentimental fancies : \" Miss Mortimer thought it a very dismal plant, only fit for funerals. Mrs. Mortimer loved violets as weU as myrtle, and Ellen Raymond kept her supplied; for she liked though she slightly despised the kindly gentle old lady, who was so unlike her children, and was kept in such good order by them. Her taste and her \" soft hearted little follies,\" were unsparingly rallied by her"], [156, "144 UPS AND DOWNS. family, while a great deal of attention was paid to her as \" Mrs. Mortimer.\" Poor little sensitive woman! she returned thanks perpetually for being the proud mother of such a fine family-. She devoutly- believed in and admired her children ; but in the fulness of their prosperity and success she sighed sometimes, and perhaps, if the truth were told, would have been glad if any one of them had even a bad headache, which might be an excuse for her showing, and their receiving, a little \" foolish\" affection. Even as children they had been singularly self sustained and independent of all mother-love or fond coaxing. The only one who had secretly sought and cared for her sympathy and comfort was Granville; and in spite of his having some of the family manner, he was really more like his mother than his father. Less regularly good looking than his brothers, or any* one of the party but Anne, he inherited the deep earnest, luminous, blue eye of his mother, which paled and glowed with each passing emotion, and often was strangely at variance with the cold stillness he could throw over his other features. As a child, he had been sensitive, anxious, and wayward. His excellent but exceedingly pompous father had frowned and puzzled over this deviation from the family type. He was inclined to take \"severe measures, or the lad would turn out a disgrace to the Mortimers ; \" but his mother knew and understood the \" type.\""], [157, "THE MORTIMERS. 145 On her shoulder, the passionate boy would cry, when provoked beyond his power of endurance by his less sensitive brothers and sisters. Too anxious to be successful, though with deeper powers, he often saw his more brilliant, and rather shallow, brother John carry off the prize he had striven for. Proud and ambitious, he felt the mortification of being less handsome, and less showy in attainments, than the other, with the character of a bad temper in addition. Once, when giving way to a passionate fit, the indescribable contempt, the goading scorn, and the lofty air of superiority, assumed by his brothers and sisters, struck him deeply. From that hour he stifled all outward demonstration of passion, or even of feeling. He would rush away to the fields, or to an empty room, quivering in every limb : each pulse throbbing wildly, pale with suppressed agitation. But he never again exposed himself before them. He admired and respected his father, and all his brothers and sisters ; he loved, but after that memo rable day, he dared not show that he loved, his mother. He became a silent, unsociable, reserved boy, and a greedy reader. His mother felt this estrangement very much ; but she understood the cause, and was silent. Her husband was pleased to find the lad had learnt to control himself. He would never be equal to the others, Mr. Mortimer would remark ; he was so unready and bashful, so sullen and silent, and VOL. i. L"], [158, "146 UPS AND DOWNS. all that reading of idle books would make him unfit for life. The father died very suddenly, and Mr. Hay, brother to Mrs. Mortimer, kindly gave his help and advice about settling the boys. He took John himself, to study'medicine under him, and left to him his excellent practice. He also did what old Mr. Mortimer would never have consented to \u2014 he sent Granville to college. But notwithstanding the well doing of her children, and her brother's ready help, Mrs. Mortimer never quite revived after her husband's death. Missing his strong, reliable head and arm, which had so long entirely guarded and upheld her, she shrank more and more from contact with active, busy hfe, and at last, meekly conquering all opposition, remained secluded in her own room ; leaving aU the management of the house to her not unwilling daughter. There was a gathering in Mrs.'Mortimer's \"Snug gery.\" She was herself holding a skein of wool for her eldest daughter, and looked a little flushed, but very soft and pretty in the close, neat, quiUed lace border, which formed a becoming setting to the face, stdl bearing many marks of beauty. She looked every- now and then proudly around on her progeny ; yet, when in so doing she hindered the smooth run of the scarlet thread, and her daughter recalled her attention, with \"Mrs. Mortimer! Mrs. Mortimer!"], [159, "THE MORTIMERS. 147 spare my Berlin wool \u2014 if you please ! \" there was a nervous twitch about the mouth, and a slight tremble in the little white hands, which bespoke a nervous temperament. In the window seat, were Rosamond and GranviUe. She was looking her best : her complexion was fresh and clear, her skin white and lips red, and her brown eyes and curly brown hair nearly faultless. Granville looked at her admiringly, and played now and then with her long curls. \"It is pretty hair, Rosy,\" he remarked, smiling slightly. \" Granville, don't be absurd ! \" she retorted ; for it was not customary among the Mortimers to use any of those little endearments or caresses which brothers and sisters sometimes indulge in. He conthiued, without heeding her, \"It is the colour of Alick's. How very good looking the boy is ! Aunt Hay is very proud of him.\" \" To be sure ! \u2014 yet, I beheve he vexes her greatly.\" \"How so?\" Rosamond blushed, and played with her watch chain as she answered, \" Because he provokes her and opposes her, ' for fun' as he says. He pretends to be very sweet\" (the Mortimers among them selves had a set of expressions and words which some people chose to call slang) \"with Ellen Ray mond, whom she doesn't love particularly.\" \" Pretends ! \u2014 I fancied it was something more ! \" L 2"], [160, "148 ULS AND DOWNS. \"I daresay he thinks her handsome, and Miss Raymond is just what you gentlemen always admire.

By the by, Granville, what do you think of the youth? He is good-looking, isn't he? though I can't under stand the fuss that is made about him. But then I confess, I dislike the Creole manner and way of speaking.\" \" I do not observe anything peculiar,\" said Gran ville. \" Of course you would not. You incline to West Indians \u2014 I don't ! For mercy's sake, Rose, don't you be getting up a love affair with Alick ! I shrewdly suspect you. But one connection of the kind is sufficient.\" \"You seem to have a prejudice, Eliza, against them.\" \" Prejudice ! No ! it is a dislike. All my feelings are antagonistic to them \u2014 an unsuccessful, fallen race, who possessed riches and had not the wit to keep enough to live upon. They all want a good shaking!\" Mrs. Mortimer laughed faintly, and ventured to remark, \" I confess, I always had a liking for"], [161, "THE MORTIMERS. 149 them. I knew many West Indian families when I was young. There was so much gentlemanly feeling, so much of the old-fashioned courtesy and honour, which is not the fashion now, I think.\" \" Yes ; \" chimed in Granville, \" they were a race that a certain set of circumstances had served to make peculiar. They had their faults, but also a great many good qualities. I take it we shall not on the whole, see their ldie again.\" \" Spoiled children ! \" reiterated Miss Mortimer, with her bright, sunny smile, which served to temper the asperity of her speech, and won her the character of being amiable : \"Enervated Sybarites! just able to loll about and drawl out their orders to a parcel of negroes, and live luxuriously on Madeira, pineapples, and pepperpot.\" \" From all accounts, their luxurious living at least sat very gracefully on them. And, notwithstanding Wilberforce and Company, I believe few English masters are ever so generous, liberal, and indulgent, as these persons were to their negroes \u2014 I speak of latter times, of course. If they had wealth, they knew how to be hospitable and charitable ; and Eliza, surely, you wdl allow, that now, in adver sity, poverty, and distress, these ' Sybarites ' have shown endurance and patience to a very uncommon degree.\" \" But no energy,\" put in Miss Mortimer. \" That I deny. I happen to know of instances, and"], [162, "150 UPS AND DOWNS. those not a few, of quiet energetic perseverance to an extent rarely met with. It is not their nature to be noisy or bustling. They have borne cruel taunts, and bitter wrongs ; and I know (for I happen to have heard a great deal about her) of one woman \u2014 a lady reared in all the luxury and wealth you describe \u2014 now in the decline of Use. Well ! her education, though expensive and according to the fasldon of her age, has not fitted her to teach the rising generation, nor can she sew so as to be a milliner. Starvation stared her in the face \u2014 or dependance on a distant relative. This frail gentlewoman, visited I can't tell how many lawyers' rooms and offices ; she wrote a good clear hand, and craved employment in copying papers and deeds. At last she secured enough of this drudgery, to gain her a few shillings a week ; on which, she lives in a small lodging in London ; and out of which, to my certain knowledge, she spares some to an old faithful, broken-down servant \u2014 a brown woman.\" He paused, having spoken fast and warmly. He had come behind his mother's chair and leant on its back. She was looking up fondly at him. He stooped and kissed her forehead, very gently, and then, in a quieter tone, added, \" And this is only one example among hundreds ! It is true, that those of the old generation are unfit to \u2014 to \u2014 struggle, with the different spirit which stamps this age and generation. They, with their"], [163, "THE MORTIMERS. 151 warm hearts, strong passions, and generous, open handed liberality \u2014 have had their day; have done their work too, as I believe. With other circum stances, another and different set must spring up on the old soil ; but who shall say that the fallen leaves have not enriched the ground, even as they fell ? \" There was an earnestness in his voice which checked even the smart reply that was on his elder sister's lips. A little pause of sdence followed, broken presently by the mother. \" Granville is right. Oh, I knew and loved several Creoles ; and Eliza has reason also, in what she says,\" added Mrs. Mortimer, glancing timidly towards her daughter. \"Of course, it was very wrong to have slaves ; only, I don't think they were so very cruel, after all. But remember, my dears, to be care ful what you say ; Mrs. John is coming presently, and you know both her father and her mother were West Indians.\" \" I, for one, am not likely to forget the fact,\" returned Miss Mortimer, and she added, \" Perhaps she is one of your specimens of Creole energy \u2014 eh, Granville? \" But the conversation was stopped by the entrance of Cecil, looking satisfied, pleased, and successful, as he always did. He had not seen his mother before that day. \" Good-day, Mrs. Mortimer. Ah ! quite a reunion,"], [164, "152 UPS AND DOWNS. and if I mistake not, here comes an accession \u2014 and a very pleasing and delightful one, I am sure,\" he added as Bessie came into the room. She seemed a little flurried, and, not quite certain whether to shake hands or not, coloured up, remem bering that \" the Mortimers\" never did so among themselves ; she breathed out a gentle \" thank you,\" as Granvdle placed a chair for her next his mother, and as Mrs. Mortimer put her hand on hers and said, \u25a0\"I am glad to see you, my love,\" Bessie bent over her and kissed her; blushing yet more after doing so, and scarcely daring to meet the eye of others. Mrs. Mortimer liked these kisses of her daughter in-law ; and, when not observed, many a little expression of tenderness and love was wont to be exchanged between them. \" And where is Jack ? \" asked Cecil. \" Not re turned from work yet ? \" \" Yes ; oh yes, some time ago,\" Bessie answered, with a stifled sigh. \" He is not very busy now : I suppose it is a very healthy season, and of course one ought to be glad. But John promised to follow very soon,\" she added brightly. \" It would not have hurt him if he had walked with you through the slippery streets,\" remarked Granville, who still stood behind his mother's chair. She turned and looked at him with a sweet deprecating smde. \"He was so taken up with a"], [165, "153 THE MORTIMERS. book : it is my fault, for he said I had better wait for him; but \u2014 but I was afraid \u2014 that is I thought I might keep tea waiting, and I don't the least mind walking alone : I never do.\" \"You were right to come, my dear,\" said Mrs. Mortimer, patting her hand. \" And I hope John won't be long, for, you know, it is my birthday, and this is to be a quite a party, and I shall have some singing.\" \" Well, Mrs. Mortimer, I will say, that I don't believe a finer looking woman of her years is to be hunted up a hundred miles round. Why, posi tively- your colour rivals Rose's: you don't rouge, do you, Mrs. Mortimer ? \" \" Oh Cecil ! an old woman like me \" But come, isn't it time to order the tea up ? \" Granville rang the bell. \" A pretty ' squash' it will be,\" exclaimed Anne, who had not before looked up from her book, but who generally acted as tea-maker. \" Yes, I don't exactly understand why tea couldn't be taken downstairs, as usual,\" said Miss Mortimer. \" I am sorry ; I hope it won't be very uncom fortable,\" said the mother nervously. \"I forgot how large the party was, I believe ; and, I thought \u2014 just for once, you know, to-day \u2014 I should like to have you all here for tea: all but dear Charlotte; and then Granville's return, and \" In fact, Mrs. Mortimer was sentimentally inclined"], [166, "154 UPS AND DOWNS. to-day,\" pronounced her eldest daughter. \" Well, squeeze in, good people : lucky it is cold weather. Now, Mrs. Mortimer, here we all are, round the table \u2014 all but that defaulter, Jack. A capital opportunity for you to admire your family.\" Miss Mortimer spoke in her clear well-toned voice, ending in a musical laugh. Granvdle settled his mother's seat and then looked at his sister. \" It is a pleasant sight ; especially after wandering about so long. \" As you say, Gran,\" said Cecil, throwing down his newspaper, \" a very pleasant sight, and I am hungry. To a hungry man, that exceedingly delightful looking cake is about as goodly a sight \u2014 as Mont Blanc itself, eh Gran ? \" \" Good patience ! what in the name of wonder is all this ? \" exclaimed John, standing in the door way and drawing up his eyebrows ; which made him strikingly like his elder sister. Then, with a loud laugh, he came in. \" A famdy party, as I 'm alive ! Too much for your nerves, eh, Mrs. Mortimer?\" \" No ; I like to see all my children about me.\" \" Here is room,\" said Bessie, looking at her husband, and moving her chair to the corner, and so nearer to Granville. \" Thanks, Mrs. John ; yet excuse me, but I prefer this seat. Rosy, you look w*ell : you 're a young woman I am not ashamed to own as sister, or to sit"], [167, "THE MORTIMERS. 155 near,\" he added, placing himself by his youngest sister. His wife tried to hide her flushed face in her cup. Granville remarked in a low voice, \" Don't sit so uncomfortably at the corner, Bess,\" and pushed her chair straight again. Cecil, meanwhile, cut the cake, and after eating some and praising it, he inquired if it was home made. \" Eliza made it,\" answered Anne. \" Incomparable woman ! \" exclaimed Cecd. \" Miss Mortimer, you are worthy of all praise.\" \" Yes, faith, she is a passable woman,\" said John. \" I can't think how it came to pass that you are stiU ' Miss Mortimer,' \" he added, shaking back his hand some curly head, with a roguish smile. \" You 're the very woman for a wife ! Any man might jump at such a one.\" \" Thank you. I suppose you mean a compliment. But I had no vocation that way, Jack.\" \" The combination of sugar, spice and egg, is reaUy super-excellent,\" put in Cecil, cutting another slice. \"A praiseworthy accomplishment is that of cookery, Miss Mortimer.\" \" According to my notions, every woman should know something about it,\" she answered, lightly. \" True,\" said John. \" Mrs. John, do you hear?\" \" Your wife is not much of a housekeeper, I"], [168, "156 UPS AND DOWNS. think?\" remarked Rosy, smiling coquettishly at her handsome brother. \"I am Aery stupid,\" said Bessie, hesitating and blushing ; \" but I have now a receipt-book and I mean to learn.\" \" You learn ! \" laughed her husband, scornfully. \" One of the aristocratic Raymonds deign to beat eggs and bake ? I like that ! \" \" I should think a mother could find something more important to do than even beating eggs,\" retorted Granville, with a frown, and in his coldest manner. \" Yes, such babes too ! \" put in Mrs. Mortimer. \" How are they, my dear ? they didn't come to give granny a kiss to-day.\" \" It was so cold, and Lisa has a cough,\" pleaded Bessy. \" She 's a sweet little thing ! \" said grandmamma. \"Not nearly so handsome as the other,\" urged Miss Mortimer. \" Ah ! baby is hke her papa,\" exclaimed Bessie, in a pleased voice. \"I daresay! No doubt she is the handsomest,\" said Mrs. Mortimer, \" yet, I must own, to me \" She paused and sighed a very little, adding apolo getically, \" You know Lisa is such a loving child, and she is fond of me, though I am an old woman.\" \" She is more of a Raymond than a Mortimer in looks,\" Anne asserted in a quiet positive tone. \" And in temper, too,\" added Miss Mortimer."], [169, "THE MORTIMERS. 157 \" The Mortimers have been ever famous for hand some women,\" said Mrs. Mortimer. \" And men, I believe,\" added John. \" Yes !

Now they are all gone.\" \"Don't be falling into dismalities, pray,\" said Rosamond, pertly. \" Well ! \" exclaimed Cecil, having finished his tea, and gazing slowly and with a benevolent smile at all the faces assembled, \" Mother, I don't think the present representatives of our respected family dis grace the name.

A little light and pleasant chatter now took place between the three brothers and Rosamond. Miss Mortimer had left the room to fetch something. John was joking his bachelor brothers ; especially Cecil, who he declared had tried hard to win so many fair ladies, but they were all afraid of his height and size. \" Listen ! \" presently said Anne, \" here is a bit of advice for you, and she read out \u2014 \" Comment, disaient Us, sans philtres subtils, etre aimes des belles ?

Eh, Granville, do you beheve it?\" \" Perhaps I did once. Yes,\" he added presently, \" I beheve it, under certain circumstances.\" \"Believe what?\" asked Miss Mortimer, again joining them. \"That love brings love, in plain English,\" said Cecil. \" If so, Jack, how many hearts do you count? \" \" One true one, certainly,\" murmured Granville, in a very low voice ; but his sister heard him. \" One !

Ellen Raymond was a favourite partner once, or I am mistaken.\" Granvdle looked) quickly and keenly towards his brother, who turned on his heel muttering a word not fit to be written, and, to his wife's utter confusion and distress, he laughed in a jeering way, and, chucking her under the chin, said : \" Mrs. John here knows, and can bear witness; how I love and admire her amiable sister, don't you, Bess?\" \"I wish it were more, John,\" she sighed]; and catching his hand, she tried to hold it a moment, murmuring that it was cold, and chafing it with hers; but he snatched it away and went to the window seat, where Rosamond was dressing a doll. \" For whom ? \" asked John. \" For Lisa ; I promised her one.\" \" That reminds me, Mrs. John,\" he said, \" you will have to be sharp with that child, or she '11 turn out a miserable little fret.

Poor child ! \" murmured Bessie ; and she rose up as if intending to go to her. \" Sit still, I beg,\" said her husband ; \" you spoil that child.\" \" Indeed, Mrs. John, I fear you will make her but a sensitive weakling if you don't teach her to control her feelings,\" said Miss Mortimer. And then Anne spoke ; and even Rosy had her word about it. Cecil said something about Solomon and a rod. Bessie looked and felt very wretched and very gudty, but infinitely grateful for her mother-in-law's kind whisper \u2014 \" Lisa's temper won't bear severity. She is such a tender, sensitive thing ! \" \" Sensitive and tender be hanged ! \" cried John. \" I don't see any good such feehngs do.\" Miss Mortimer here proposed some singing, and after a little discussion they had some glees, Rosa mond giving the key-note on her guitar. It w*as very beautiful to hear the harmony and precision of style; the family voice blending so well. No wonder that the mother's eyes (N.B. \u2014 she was not"], [173, "THE MORTIMERS. 161 born a Mortimer !) were somewhat dim, causing her to stoop and cover them with her thin and w*hite hand. It was really beautiful music \u2014 they were her children ! And Bessie bent over the little sock she was knitting, and listened for every note in one voice, forgetting all the rest in that ! But, in proposing another, Granville was called for ; they then, for the first time, discovered he was not there. From having been so long absent, most of their glees were complete without him ; now, however, he was wanted and inquiries were made. But neither Mrs. Mortimer nor Bessie had noticed him leave the room. Before another song had been decided on, he returned, and was greeted by \u2014 \" Where have you been ? \" \" Come, you must take this tenor ; you three men are to sing it together.\" \" I don't know it.\" \" What does that signify ? You can sing at sight, and it is easy.\" He said no more, but begged Rosamond just to play his part over on her guitar; and then they sano-. When it was finished, Granville walked quietly round to Bessie's chair, and, stooping, he whispered hi her ear : \" Be easy, Bess !

After a good deal of music interspersed with talk ing, Mrs. Mortimer said she was very tired, and must leave them. She looked pale, and had held her hand to her side for some little time. \" Nonsense, Mrs. Mortimer ! Can't be allowed ! It is quite early : your birthday, too ! \" But Mrs. Mortimer was wishing Bessie \" Good night,\" in her gentle, low voice, and Granville had lighted her candle. As she left the room, accompanied by Rosamond, and the door shut, Miss Mortimer remarked, carelessly : \" The fact is, she has so long played at fancying herself an invalid, she can't bear anything.\" \" You 're wrong, Miss Mortimer. There 's no play in the matter,\" said John, biting his lips. Cecil looked up. \" What do you mean, John ? \""], [175, "THE MORTIMERS. 163 \" I mean that Well, it is perhaps better to speak out: only don't go and make a fuss and tell her.\" \" Tell her what ? \" asked Granville, gravely. \" Why, that it is the heart : something amiss there.

Every eye was now fixed on him, as he w*as speaking professionally, and so gravely and firmly that his wife was surprised : even in her true distress at his words, her heart beat with fond pride for him. \" The state of the case is this,\" continued John : \" She may drop down at any moment ; she may live for months, even for years ! But any sudden agita tion would probably- be fatal.\" A profound silence followed. Miss Mortimer's bright face was grave, Cecil leant on his hands, and was stooping with both elbows on the table. Gran ville stood erect, stiU and calm, but pale ; and his fingers were closed tightly on the back of the chair. Bessie stared at her husband with a look of horror and inquiry. Then she rose to go home, and they all left the room; each, in his own way, thinking there would be a blank, when they would no longer find there the sympathy which never failed \u2014 when it ceased to be M 2"], [176, "164 UPS AND DOWNS. the centre of all the pleasant family gossip and meeting !

CHAPTER XL MRS. HAY AT HOME. \" Good morning, Granville ! Do you know that I was rather hoping to see you? all weU at home, I trust?\" said Mrs. Hay as her nephew Granville Mortimer entered her drawing-room. The blinds were half-down, and large muslin curtains spread over the windows admitted only a subdued light. A delicious but strong perfume filled the room, from hot-house plants, which were arranged in tiers on either side the deep bay windows. Two or three gay plumed birds in glittering cages hung there, veiled by the soft folds of mushn drapery. The room was small, but filled up with ottomans, easy- chairs and faded fauteuils with tarnished gold tassels. An exquisite little work-table with netting materials stood by Mrs. Hay, and some haff-open letters lay beside her. A keen eye would perhaps note that the carpet was faded and threadbare, and the sofa cushions much the worse for wear. There was a mixture of luxury and poverty in the air of the room ; of good and bad taste : for execrable pictures hung on the walls, and a number"], [179, "MRS. HAY AT HOME. 167 of shabby old-fashioned albums and annuals were stuck, >hy house-maids' rule, on the centre table. The whole tint was neutral \u2014 a sort of dim hazy grey : there was no decided colour anywhere ; except the parrot's feathers and the brilliant red camelias. \" We heard you had a headache, Aunt. Alick reported dismally of you: I hope he coloured highly?\" \" Nothing, nothing, dear Granville ! a little fretted, a little anxious ; and he, poor dear fellow, partly knows why, and likes to ascribe it to headache.\" \" What is the Western news ?

I wish to my heart he had his commission : his prospects are very poor.

I heard of it from herself,\" and he walked once up and down the room and then sat down again. \" You need say no more.

She spoke of other matters, lightly and freely ; he scarcely answering, but sitting erect, disdaining the inviting cushions : he seemed to be strengthening himself for some resolution, and doing even then, fierce battle with temptation. He looked positively fierce as he sat there con fronting his aunt, looking at her, and making random replies to her remarks. She fidgetted about for her salts-bottle ; she tied up her letters ; even put aside her work-table ; but he did not stir. \" Granville ! my dear nephew,\" said she, after a pause, \" this has been a very painful conversation to us both \u2014 now tell me of yourself ; what are your prospects ? \""], [185, "MRS.

No ! It must be dug up \u2014 unearthed \u2014 made clear, Aunt! The Mortimers never like a mystery, as our motto shows.\" \" Oh, Granville, for Heaven's sake, be careful ! Take care what you do !

In spring it was a pretty lane, gemmed with violets and blue-bells, and tricke d out with ferns ; now it was wet and dirty, with a bare leafless hedge-growth. Here he had often rambled with the young Raymonds when they came home for the holidays. He leant on a gate for a long time, and then hurried back. That night he shut himself up in his own room and wrote a long letter. His sisters wondered whether a \"poetical fit\" had suddenly seized him."], [187, "175 CHAPTER XII. CONFESSIONS. From Granville Mortimer to his Friend. Poole, February. \" Dea e Richaed, Very strange it seems to me, that this same thin sheet of paper should be my only medium of communication with you \u2014 stranger still, that it should be destined for India. \" I did not linger long after our parting at Cairo. I relinquished my intended stay in Provence, and further exploration of the Pyrenees, owing to letters from home. Not any illness, not any apparent urgent affair, called me home ; but simply a gossip ing, chatty letter, crossed and re-crossed, from my little sister. I confess, too, I was home-sick. I am, as you know, an Englishman to the bone ; specially in my appreciation of home. Ah, Dick ! what visions has that same word of four letters raised in my mind. What is home ? It is not merely a house \u2014 a building of any kind: a bachelor cannot have a home ! \" You have heard me describe my home, many a"], [188, "176 UPS AND DOWNS. time. I found it pretty much as I left it ; and, thank God ! the centre \u2014 the pivot on which all besides hangs for me \u2014 my mother \u2014 was here to welcome me. I declare, Dick, my heart smote me then for leaving her so long. I did not dream of it before ; but now I know that her remaining days are probably, or rather possibly, to be few. My brother, the doctor, says that her heart is diseased. I feel that hers will be no common mother's loss. She is of another mould than we are. I dread the absence of her gentler, and more retiring, her more affectionate and tender mind and heart. The Mortimers are not a bad set ; but it strikes me, as it never did before, that there is a certain hardness pervading us all. For myself, I am growing more rigid, more ' unapproachable,' as you used to say, than ever. \" Some author says, ' The setting of a great hope is like the setting of the sun. The brightness of our life is gone. The soul withdraws into itself.' The brightness of my life is gone !

If I am now moved to confession \u2014 if I am irresis tibly impelled, as it were, to allow some vent to my long pent-up, raging passion \u2014 it is solely, under the knowledge that you are so far away ; that the sea rolls betwixt us, and that in your comely face I may never look again.

I was a strange, I may say an ill conditioned child. Strong feeling, sensitive nerves, caused my life to be rough and dark. I alone of all the family, was not handsome; at which I early heard my mother sigh and saw my father frown. I alone had the curse of a temper which, when much provoked, became violent and was always self-vexing, suspicious, anxious and wayward. vol. i. x"], [190, "178 UPS AND DOWNS. My mother's soft kisses and pitiful eye were my one only comfort. But I learnt to be ashamed of and to shun that. I became almost a misanthrope : I hated society and sought solitude, where I indulged in strange fancies that seemed in their utter shape lessness hke dreams. But I wiU hurry over this picture of about as disagreeable a boy as could be found, I suppose ; sensitively conscious of not being liked, and yet with a fierce heart which greedily craved for what it was too proud to seek. What I should have become, I can't teU ; but I was saved. \" My health faded ; no wonder, from the life I led and the conflict ever going on between self and circumstances. I was sent to an old servant who had married and settled at a poor fishing village \u2014 the wddest and most romantic of places. The peculiar, extreme, and to me, new beauty of the scene, afforded me my first sensation of happi ness. A new page hi the book of hfe was opened to me. Those restless waves tossing on that rocky shore ; \u2014 the poor, but picturesque straggling village on the hill, the rich valley, and the stately Abbey which was so beautifully sheltered and folded among grand old trees ! All this formed an era in my life. I became conscious of new powers. I felt, young as I was, I could defy the world, whde I could dream and revel hi such a scene. On wild, stormy evenings, when the rain had driven me in against my will, I listened to old tales, mingled"], [191, "CONFESSIONS. 179 with village gossip, of the family who lived in the Abbey. Some of these stories were as exciting and as bad as any boy could desire. Some of them \u2014 would I could forget now ! But as I write, they rise up and confirm but no matter ! \" One day, when I was as usual, stretched out on a rock perched midway between sea and sky, half way down the steep cliff, I was disturbed by the sound of girls' voices. I had before seen them about, but in my wretched shyness, I had shunned them as if they were wild beasts. Now, however, they were close to me. One of them, daring to climb where I had climbed, finding herself in a difficulty, called on me for help. I remember feeling inclined to feign sleep, to slip down at the risk of death \u2014 anything to avoid speaking ; but, however, I looked up, and the sight of those clear, spirited, honest eyes, charmed me. I helped her, and then her sister. When we were all safe on the pebbles, she threw off her bonnet, declaring it was shady here, and she could do without it. And I then noted her hair. I had never seen such : it was so full of colour ; Uke some silks I have observed, assuming different shades in different light. I never before thought of remarking hair \u2014 never dreamt of its behig beautiful ! Well, they asked me to play with them, and I did so. Then, by and by, they led me to see their mamma.

To her, I owe whatever I have succeeded in, whatever I have avoided of sin. She was the lady of the Abbey. Her husband was at that time in the West Indies, attending to business. Their property decreasing, the Abbey lands were soon after sold or let, and they came to live quietly at Poole ; induced to do so by my uncle's wife, who had been an early friend of theirs. By this means my intimacy was kept up and strengthened. The girls were as sisters to me ; more so tban my own sisters ever were. I loved them both, but their mother even more ; and from the very first, my heart had singled out and preferred one above the other. When I say, preferred, I hardly know if that is a right expression. For certainly I often approved more of the other ; though I was strangely fascinated, in spite of some faults and now and then a quarrel between us, by \u2014 her name was \u2014 Ellen! \" I soon found out that Mrs. was not happy in her marriage.

The sisters grew more and more lovely. My brother admired and liked them, and joined us occasionally. I knew suddenly, from some little jealousy which sprang up, owing to her little coquetry and my brother's admiration, I felt all at once, that w*ild throb \u2014 that intoxication \u2014 that kindling of a fire never again to be quenched, in fact I felt \u2014 love ! I knew I loved her, not as a brother \u2014 not as a friend. I have loved her ever since.

When I parted from her, to set out on my travels, we said ' good-bye,' as friends. But even at that moment, our eyes met. I don't know now what to think ; but then, I believed she read my heart, and I read hers. I sometimes repented my resolve, and longed to remain near her ; feeling a presentiment that these two, but especially that she, would need a friend and a protector.

I trusted her : I knew her better than they did. My heart grew sick sometimes, when my sister spoke of flirtations in connection with her name !

I made allowances and excuses, and set aside my aunt's most gently expressed opinion of her unamiabdity.

It had been Mrs. Ray mond's, and many relics were affectionately retained in their old corners. There was the large high-backed chair, not very inviting; not like those Ellen loved to sink mto down-stairs : but somehow she liked this. And the little old table, with a faded flower mat and an old fashioned watch-case, and a tiny vase of very common material \u2014 but it had been \" a fairing,\" from the twins to their mother. She had valued it, so there it stood ; and seldom was it without its offering of flowers ; or if blossom there was none \u2014 a few tastefully disposed leaves. There were pictures on the walls ; many of them old prints which Mrs. Raymond had brought from the Abbey. Some portraits of large wigged gentlemen and powdered and patched ladies, looking handsome, but brimfull of gossip and frivolity. There was a sketch or two in water-colours, evidently by a bold hand : one a seaside scene \u2014 wild and"], [199, "ELLEN'S BROTHER-IN-LAW. 187 mournful \u2014 with high frowning rock, a grey tem pestuous sky and foaming waves, with only a gull or two to relieve the monotony. Another more finished sketch of a gentleman's seat, with smooth lawn and shrubs, prettily managed for such a bad subject. Then there was a sweet, half chalk, half-tinted portrait of a very beautiful woman in full dress ; not a very young person, but full of charm in outline and expression : \" J. C. Went worth,\" was written beneath. And under this picture there was a curious frame and glass, with a dried, withered bunch of flowers, tied with grass: a strange relique, in its dry decay, contrasting almost painfully with the massive and gorgeous gilt frame. Under these two was an exquisite statuette of pure white alabaster ; a bust of a lovely woman, evidently the same as the crayon portrait. This was the chosen corner. Here, on a small table, some choice plants in blossom always stood and a few well-bound books: SheUey, Byron, and Coleridge, lay there. The room was not exactly neat : there were several \" rummage \" baskets ; a weU worn and dl used writing case, and a work-box in such a tangle and confusion that nothing less than the old Fairy Order, could put it right. The window looked out over the garden and lawn to the town. It was a pleasant place from which to watch the thrushes and robins and to hear the church-"], [200, "188 UPS AND DOWNS. bells; and now as the sunshine streamed in at the open windows, Ellen sighed as she remembered that very* soon this room, this sunny, calm retreat, would be hers no longer.

Mrs Hay has plenty of her own.\" \" Oh Nell ! let us look at your shells, for a treat, do ! \" and Ruth knelt down and coaxed, by kissing her sister's hand. Having obtained leave, she flew to the draw. Hetty remained watching Ellen fill the little old vase with violets. \" Ellen ! Mrs. Hay came mto your room, j ust now, while you were out.

But Ellen 'did not even look up at the per formance, though generally she laughed at Hetty's clever hits. \" Is my own room to be invaded? Even, perhaps, my desk and my drawers searched?

She did not admire y*our taste, she said. \" Didn't she indeed ! \" and Ellen laughed a scornful bitter laugh. When the violets were arranged, she threw aside her bonnet and sat down on the high backed chair, and rested her elbows on its huge sides, looking thoughtful and grave. \" Ellen ! we are going to spend the evening with sister Bessie, and to nurse the baby ; and she asked if you would come and bring your work.\""], [202, "190 UPS AND DOWNS. \"I can't, I am engaged: Lily is coming for a lesson to-night.

The stiffness about the mouth gave way to a sweet curl ; she glanced shyly at the little girls as she bade them do no mischief. There was a buoyant yet hesitating spring in her step. She paused at the end of the passage, and pressed her hand to her side; a habit she had when at all agitated: again she hurried on, with a fast rising colour, again paused as her fingers touched the door-handle ! \" Now, Ruth ! \" said Hetty, meanwhde, \" let us have some fun, and turn out the drawers.\" \" No, no, no ! \" rephed Ruth, holding both Hetty's hands. \"Nonsense!

See, Ruth, it is a frame : and look ! look at this picture, what can it be ? who can it be ? a dark faced, rather handsome, but scowling fellow. Good gracious me ! here is a pretty to do !

He had seen the flash of fear \u2014 the change from hope to annoyance ; though it was so soon subdued into the frigid, haughty calmness with which she now greeted him. He answered carelessly, with a joke, but did not offer his hand to her. \" The top of the morning to you, Miss Raymond ! Glad to see you look so very well.

A ring at the door-bell made Mrs. John Mortimer flush up, and inquire hurriedly of the servant if she was sure that Jane had tidied the drawing-room ; then leaving the little \" two year old \" to be carried by the nurse, she took the baby down-stairs. The young sisters were there, all their late troubles vanished into bright expectations of nursing the youngest niece, and amusing the other. \" Where is Ellen ? \" inquired the proud young mother, first glancing round the room to see if her sister were there, and then back at her little fairy's face. \" She could not come ; she is engaged.\" \" Engaged ? How gay she is.\" This was followed by a gentle, disappointed sigh. \" Not very gay to-night,\" answered Hetty, sharply : \" you should have seen her face ; as long and black as the sky is before a storm.\""], [214, "202 UPS AND DOWNS. \"Hush, hush!

Mrs. John Mortimer recurred more than once to Ellen \u2014 and always with the slightest possible tone of dejection, and w*ith a short, smothered sigh. But with her lovely babies, and their two ardent admirers, the young aunts \u2014 she could not long brood on any disappointment. Tea was brought in : but the mistress said she should not make it just yet \u2014 perhaps Mr. Mortimer would be at home soon. It was not long before he was in the house, but in the noise of a game of romps with Lisa, and songs for baby, his entrance was not heard till they were all startled by his saying, \" Mercy on us, what a Babel !

The nurse was for bearing her off, regardless and unheeding; but the mother came back at the moment and tried to pacify her \u2014 without, however, understanding the cause of the cry. \" Give her a cake, can't you ? \" exclaimed her father, in no gentle voice ; and when Lisa and cake and all were carried off \u2014 he further exclaimed, \" There, that's the blessing of babies and matri mony ! \" \" For shame, John ! \" exclaimed both Hetty and Ruth.\" He looked round at them with a keen eye. \" Hetty ! you are growing handsome.

Ruth blushed and smiled; alternately admiring her clever sister, yet not without doubts or fear. When they drew round the tea-table, it was found that the toast was not weU made. John's cold blue eyes looked fearfully angry, as he flung a piece down, and with no very choice words upbraided his wife. She rang the bell and ordered more, her gentle voice all rippled by the passing storm. There was a bright hectic spot on each cheek long before tea was over ; and Ruth quietly remarked that Bessie had eaten nothing, and only taken some tea after every one else was served \u2014 cold and weak. \" Bless my soul ! don't you know Mrs. John Mortimer's peculiar desire is to be a martyr? Now don't disturb her, Ruth, 'tis cruel of you. \" Chacun a son gout,\" said her husband. Bessie looked at him and smiled, a sweet but deprecating smile, but the flush deepened. Then she spoke of Ellen \u2014 how she had expected her and was disappointed; on which her husband broke into loud laughter, at the very* idea of her expecting \" Miss Raymond in this plebeian hole, the refined Miss Raymond ! \" \" By the by, Mrs. John Mortimer,\" he added, \" Do you remember the singing-master Signor some body, at your school ? \""], [217, "THE THREE AUNTS. 205 \" He was not there in my time, you know,\" she answered. \" I was out of health, and had left.

But it was evident that she was listening anxiously at the heavy steps upstairs, at the opening and shutting of doors ; till at last, her husband passed the window, and was really gone. When they returned home, the children found that the Colonel was out, and they sought Ellen's room, before going to the nursery.

But no one did see it. Per haps no one in Poole had ever seen this expression of the ever varying face, which was cried up as that of a distinguished beauty. Every line was full of tender softness, and to the brilliant light of the eyes succeeded a look of impassioned love and gentle gratitude, which would have astonished her admirers who raved of her imperious and haughty or wild and provoking beauty. \"Now then I shall dance all the evening to the music of these words.

She could wrap up, and it was such a hard frost : it was dry. The Colonel hesitated. \" It did not look well.\" But she laughingly declared that no one would see her; and in her happy spirits, she kept up a light and merry chatter during their walk. The father could not conceal his admiration of her as she joined him at the door, having laid aside her wraps : he thought she had never looked so lovely : he was surprised, recollecting her weary look of annoyance at dinner that day*. No sooner were they inside the room, than several eager claimants for her hand surrounded them. But with a nonchalant air she declared her\" intention of not dancing the first dance, and took possession of a"], [227, "THE WARNING AND THE CHOICE. 215 seat in one of the window recesses which commanded a full view of the door. \"Are you vexed with me to-night ? \" asked Alick Hay, presently, taking his station beside her. \" Be cause you certainly were angry with me the other evening, yet I couldn't make out what I had done.\" \" I forget ! \u2014 I beheve you wearied me: you would not leave me a moment, and I was not inclined for jokes.\" \" Your words differ so.

Truly, he was a hand some fellow !

Thank you, Mr. Hay ! but I am not intruding, am I ?

Aster the waltz, Ellen returned to her seat and was warmly thanked for so doing by Miss Dalton. \" I have been engaged to-day* as I often am, I am both proud and sorry to say,\" Miss Dalton observed, in a subdued voice, finding Alick had at last paused"], [231, "THE WARNING AND THE CHOICE. 219 in his running fire of quizzing jokes \u2014 \" I mean, in taking your part, my dear friend : may I not call you so ? \" \" You may call me so if you like ; but it is a character I \u25a0 don't profess to act towards any one ! \" \" Oh, don't say* so ?

Alick laughed, shook his head, and declared he must go and search for his partner, Rosamond Mor timer, to whom he had been engaged for a week or more. Ellen was also engaged, and again poor Miss Dalton was left alone. This time, however, she made her way to Mrs. Hay, with w*hom she was very soon in earnest talk. \" Repeating to my mother all we said just now,\" Alick whispered, glancing towards his mother and Miss Dalton, as the dance brought him to Ellen."], [233, "THE WARNING AND THE CHOICE. 221 \" V ery likely,\" she said.

She became suddenly grave and sdent, and made random answ*ers to her partner, who was Mr. Taylor. He smiled, and remarked that \"such a tall, still figure, which seemed to be cut out of granite, yet with such a reproving frown on his face, was enough to petrify all the dancers. If there was truth in animal magnetism, or whatever the power was called, he wondered that some people had not the gift of stiffening those they looked upon.\" But his wit, if it was intended to pass for such, fell to the ground unheeded. Miss Raymond did not seem to understand who was meant by \" the figure.\" She repeated some astounding facts she had lately read, about mesmerism, etc., and as soon as the quadrille ended, she said she must look for another seat, her own corner being occupied. Her partner found a phair, rather near the door. A waltz was being played, which Ellen declined dancing, pleading fatigue. She sat alone therefore, and watched the dancers, as they whisked past her. At length, as it sometimes happens, her eye became riveted unconsciously on one particular couple. At first, her"], [234, "222 UPS AND DOWNS. thoughts were elsewhere ; and she was only conscious of their extreme agility and swiftness, and of a spinning bar (as it seemed) of scarlet, caused by the lady's sash, which made her dizzy to watch. But these rapid waltzers stopped at last, just before her ; and she recognised the one who had made the scarlet line to be Lucy Taylor; and her partner \u2014 John Mortimer. \" You beat Rosy hollow. You are now, out and out, the best waltzer here,\" he observed as soon as he had breath. \"No; not so good as Ellen Raymond, or your own wife.\" \" Pooh ! my wife ! what fun is there in a matri monial waltz ? Yet, to please her little jealous heart, I do submit to the penance now and then, to be sure ; but \" \" I have not observed you dance with your sister in-law lately.

She turned just a little, and said \u2014 \" How is it you have not danced ? Have you forsworn such folly ? \" \" It has lost its charm,\" returned Granville Mor timer. \" I never was a great lover of dancing, for dancing's sake.

Mrs. Hay could not sit, as there was no other chair. Ellen rose, and with a formal, freezing polite ness, begged Mrs. Hay to take her seat, pushing it out of the door draught ; and then, with a low sweep of her small and stately head, looking so well with its bright coronet of hair, she passed swiftly behind the persevering waltzers, and joined some ladies who were at the opposite side of the room. A conversa tion was soon got up with one of the group, who wished to know about Lily Day, having set her heart on getting her as a housemaid ; and she now set forth a long string of reasons, why it would be a far better plan for the girl than the scheme proposed by her own friends, namely living in London with an aunt she had never seen.

The ladies had also gone for some tea or coffee, which was being served in another room. Ellen was again alone. She looked about her, but seeing no one with whom she cared to be, with her usual independence she sat down on the cushioned bench which lined that side of the room. Presently John Mortimer approached, with a sneering smile, and a burning light in his clear blue eyes. \" I wish you would stand up with me !

No word was spoken on either side till she had finished the coffee which Granville brought her.

Do confess now, that you are as curious as any woman to know what she said of you.\" \" I was thinking of something very different,\" he answered ; smiling, too, a little, as he caught that look of hers. \" You won't confess ; but I know you to be curious of old. Do you remember when Bessie and I joked you so unmercifully, as to who \" She stopped, and her smile went out, leaving her face dark and troubled. He answered quickly, not heeding her sudden breaking off: \" Yes ; I remember well. I don't believe there is one incident, one word, one look, I don't remember and recall \u2014 vividly. Sometimes I wish my memory was less good \u2014 my imagination, or fancy, less quick at reproducing past scenes like pictures. No, not pictures, but like living realities.\" \" Surely it is a pleasure ! What would life be without old memories ? \" she sighed. \" It makes the present so very dull and dreary,\" he answered.

But the room was again fiding, and they were no longer able to speak safely. John Mortimer passed near, and looking at Ellen, whistled. It seemed to wrap her in some dark cloud instantly ; or rather, to bind her with some strong but invisible cord. She stiffened in every limb \u2014 in her attitude, as well as in each feature. Her shivering drew Granvdle's attention. \" You will be id to-morrow, I see !

I remember now all about it. To be sure ! Has she any beauty left?\" Ellen vouchsafed not a word or look. Granville earnestly watched her evident agitation, and then his eyes scanned his brother's handsome, reckless, gay countenance and bearing.

She is still a"], [252, "240 UPS AND DOWNS. magnificent \u2014 a beautiful woman: at least to those who like that style,\" said Granville. John did not seem to hear him ; he looked in a meaning way at his brother, and then at Ellen. He held out his hand, but withdrew it again, as if with sudden recol lection. \" For heaven's sake, Ellen, command yourself ! \" he said, speaking low, but so that Granville could hear every word. \" What have I done to excite such burning hate ? My very neighbourhood seems to excite you ! Whatever I say, the kinder, the more fraternal I try- to be \" He spoke in a tone of blunt yet keen regret, and turning appealingly to Granville, shrugged his shoulders, and murmured low, in his brother's hearing, \" Unfortunate ! Dis tressing, by Jove ; and seems to get worse.\" With strong effort, impelled by a proud and decided will not often met with, Ellen succeeded in mastering herself ; and as Granville turned towards her again, in evident surprise, after watch ing and hearing John, she met him with a determined and haughty self-possession, which was shown in the set of her head as weU as the expres sion of her face. He looked earnestly at her, as if half-expecting, if not seeking, some explanation. But when she began to laugh and talk in her usual free and lively strain to a gentleman who now joined them, Granville drew himself up, and wrapping closely round him his usual reserve and"], [253, "THE WARNING AND THE CHOICE. 241 coldness, he walked with slow steps to where his sister was. Miss Mortimer was tired, and wanted to go home, but her dancing sisters pleaded for a little more. \"Leave them to my care,\" said Mrs. Hay. \" Granville is looking sadly fagged, too \u2014 a headache, I fear?

Thank you ! \" she nodded to him, and \" Good-night ; pleasant dreams,\" she said to Miss Mortimer and Granville, who were leaving the room. Before long, there was a general rush to go, and several parties preferred a walk home in the hard frost to waiting for the one sedan chair. Alick Hay was persuading Ellen to walk home with him : she was looking about for her father, when John stepped up. \" The Colonel is gone long since : I am in charge. Alick, you are not to presume to do my lawful work. My sister Ellen is left to me : if she walks, I shall take her; if she goes in the chair, I shall march by her side \u2014 her body-guard.

Every one seemed gone but herself; and the tired, yawning attendants were hardly awake enough to assure her \"it was all right, the chair would return for her in two minutes.\" When it did, as she ran down the stairs her hand was taken. She tried to pull it away from John Mortimer, but she could not ; and the men standing about made her silently submit. Before he handed her in, he whispered in her ear \u2014 \" It is folly* to defy me so, Ellen. Why do you drive me to hatred ? \u2014 yes, and revenge ! One look of yours turns me like a weathercock !

Well, well !\u2014 Good-night.\" She wrenched away her hand, as he pressed it hi both his ; and when she was fairly shut in, burning tears forced their way, trickling slowly over her cheeks, while one convulsive, choking sob, shook her. Presently she looked out ; holding the silken curtain aside. It was so clear : so frosty, so still ! But she heard the tramp, tramp ; and, keeping up with the chairmen's step walked a cloaked figure. He looked towards her, and moved closer ; laying his hand on the pole, he talked to the man, who laughed. She watched, hoping to see him turn off"], [255, "THE WARNING AND THE CHOICE. 243 to his own house ; but no : he went on up the road with them. \" Robert will be there to let us in, that 's one comfort.

Before there was time to ring, Robert the gardener appeared. \" Oh, you 're there, then, Mr. John ! Why, only half-an-hour ago a message came to say you must please to go home directly.\" \" Any one ill wanting me ? \" In his eager ques tioning he still did not forget to hand Ellen out, and lead her, against her will, into the hall. \" Wanting you very bad, I believe,\" said Robert, more dryly and sarcastically than ever. \"Who?\" \" The girl said she had been to the ball-room, but didn't get no account of you there. She wasn't to disturb you if you were dancing, but to wait till you stopped. She came here thinking you had come home with Miss Ellen and master.\" \" What is it all about ? \" inquired John, im- patiently. \" Some nonsense of Mrs. John's, of course.\" \" Well, sir, that's a good guess ; for 'tis nonsense to fall ill !

How nurse ? \" \" Well \u2014 I don't know exactly ; but the servants say some one came inquiring for their master, and not seeing him, wished to see the missus.

And she said it was nothing : nothing at all. They wasn't to say anything of it to their master. Soon after she fainted right away, and the girls did send for him ; but there was some blunder, and they didn't find him at the assembly-room. He gave her some composing medicine, and she fell asleep, and is very well to-day ; \u2014 so he says.\" \" Did you see her ? \" \" Yes. She looked shaky-like, and I begged her to go out and get a little fresh air. The maids say she hardly ever gets out unless Mr. Granville conies and makes her.\" While Colonel Rapnond and Ellen were at break fast, and discussing this attack of Mrs. John Morti mer's, a note was brought to Ellen from her sister, begging her to walk with her ; to which she scribbled an answer of assent, hastily. \" Any one else in the whole world would go at once to a sick sister,\" said the Colonel, angrily. Ellen made no answer, but she looked very unhappy, and played in a pre-occupied way with her teaspoon. \" If it were only \u2014 only- to stop rumours \u2014 to blind people \u2014 it would be well for you to go oftener,\" he continued. \" I cannot go there, papa ! \" she answered, quietly. \"I know you hear things from \u2014 from in fact you are mistaken.

I have already said I will not allow you to seek a false justification. Your reason is perfectly well known to me \u2014 and a shameful one it is. I expect Sir John and Lady Wood to lunch here to-morrow,\" he added, after a pause. \" They wish to see my collection of medals. I wish you to be here and make yourself agreeable ; and consult with the cook as to a suitable lunch : remember Sir John is particular.\" When the Colonel lest the room, Ellen muttered in a tone of annoyance, some broken words about \" Grandees : such a fuss ! She hated such toadying. Why would her father think himself honoured by a visit from a Knight, losing his own dignity and being so desperately servile to one half a step above him.\" These visits, which delighted the Colonel's vanity, were irksome beyond expression to Ellen. She marvelled afresh each time at the inconsistency, as it seemed to be to her, in her father's character, which made him at once so proud, and yet so anxiously deferential to those he fancied above him in rank or wealth ; so fussy in all the preparations made to receive these visitors in due style, so fearful of maintaining his own opinion in opposition to theirs, and also so ready to overlook what in some others would be enough to make him quarrel. Ellen never thought her father showed to such little advantage as at such times, and the more civil and"], [260, "248 UPS AND DOWNS. obsequious he was, the colder and more repelling did she become. She disliked the wealthy and purse proud Knight, and haughtily resisted all endeavours of his rather affected lady to patronize her. Lady Wood had tried hard to induce Ellen to stay with her, to drive with her, and to draw her portrait in the \"sketchy, clever way Miss Raymond had of taking faces.\" Ellen would not be either a \" lion or a satellite,\" she declared. And now, with dl grace and heavy heart, she went to give the neces sary orders, before preparing for a w*alk with her sister. Bessie was looking unusually pale and delicate ; but she made very light of her fainting fit, saying it arose from fatigue, and several bad nights follow ing with the baby. She declared that a nice walk with Ellen would quite set her up; and as they wadied on, a faint colour tinged her cheeks, and she grew calmer and less constrained. \" I suppose you thought me a selfish, hard-hearted wretch, as I felt, not to come at once ? \" Ellen remarked. \" Oh, no ! I knew you had been dancing and were tired. Of course, I never for one moment expected or thought of \" \" Didn't you ? As if any amount of dancing would keep me from you ! As if you would not fly to me were you ever so tired?\" There was silence; both sisters looking on the"], [261, "SISTERS AND BROTHERS. 249 ground, and evidently full of some passing thoughts which they did not like to express. At last, after looking up more than once at Ellen, Bessie said earnestly, and with grave, wistful, loving look in her face \u2014 \"But, why then, Ellen, why should you not come ? Oh, if you would but tell me in what \u2014 how I \u2014 or how we have displeased you ! \u2014 why, why such cruel things are said ? It breaks my heart, Ellen.\" Ellen's face was working with strong and pas sionate agitation. It was not possible for her to speak directly*. When she could, she said in a vehement and excited tone \u2014 \" Don't, don't ! for Heaven's sake don't begin that : you must not ask, Bessie. You know what a creature I am, unsisterly, unamiable. Make up your mind to it : or rather don't think of me ! You are a wife and don't need a sister so much. Now, let us end this ; talk of something else ! How is Lisa ? and what ails baby that she keeps you from sleeping ? \" Bessie shook her head sorrowfully and sighed: she didn't answer Ellen's questions, feeling that the answer was not really cared for ; but she did not again allude to the forbidden subject. When next she spoke, making some casual remark on the hedge flowers, her voice was rather cold and her whole manner graver ; even stern \u2014 as stern as one so meek"], [262, "250 UPS AND DOWNS. and gentle could be. Ellen glanced quickly at her sister's face, and bit her lips ; and a common-place and restrained conversation was just kept up between them. When they returned Bessie asked Ellen to go with her to see Mrs. Mortimer, which Ellen acceded to ; for she liked to do so, if she could by any means get admitted to Mrs. Mortimer's quiet room without having to encounter any of the family. Bessie coloured scarlet when her mother-in-law questioned her as to the cause of her swoon, and suggested that it arose from fright at some visitor. She pleaded her former excuse, namely fatigue, and said it was only a man who wished to see her husband on business. Mrs. Mortimer told them that she had been honoured by a visit from Miss Moore, with whom she was much pleased. \" Yes,\" said Bessie, \" she does, indeed, seem a very nice person ; and her brother, too. I do wish there was no ill \u2014 I mean harsh \u2014 feeling between them and John. I really believe John does rather mis understand Dr. Moore.\" \" It strikes me that Cecil admires the lady not a little,\" observed Mrs. Mortimer, smiling. \" Indeed ? How odd ! Cecil ! I never think of him as likely to yet I don't see why* he shouldn't, I am sure,\" said Bessie, correcting herself : \" Miss Moore admires John's singing, and remarked what a good voice his was in speaking.\""], [263, "SISTERS AND BROTHERS. 251 \" Yes, true ; John has his father's voice exactly. It was the first tiling about Mr. Mortimer which struck my fancy. I was very young, not more than seventeen, when coming home in the dark one night, my father drove his gig against another. A gentle man called out. I thought even then I had never heard such a voice ; not sweet exactly, but like music : deep music. I never forgot it. Some months after I was introduced to Mr. Mortimer, and recog nised the voice. He used to say it was peculiar to his family- : that, and a neat ankle and foot. I hope, my dear Mrs. John, that your little girls have pretty feet?\" \" Call me Bessie, won't you ? \" \" So I will, my dear ; I like it best ; but I hear them all say Mrs. John, and so I fall into it.

But I got used to it, you know ! \" and Mrs. Mortimer sighed. \" But I don't get used to it, and never shall,\" returned Bessie. \" Sometimes when he forgets, and brings out Bessie or Bess, oh, I like it so much.\" Mrs. Mortimer now turned and addressed Ellen, who was looking at the pictures on the walls, and very soon she rose and said she need not hurry* her sister, but she must go home. Bessie remained. In the hall, Ellen was detained by Miss Mortimer and Anne ; but she refused their pressing invitations"], [264, "252 UPS AND DOWNS. to sit a little while with them. When a few steps from their door, she met Miss Moore. \"Your face is pleasant, by way of contrast,\" Ellen said. \" What a Mortimer-imbued place it is ! Every stone, every chair \u2014 the very air I breathe is a la Mortimer. How I do detest it.\" Miss Moore smiled. \" I cannot make out why ! I think them so agreeable. I like the dear old lady so much. Surely you don't dislike all, do you?\" \" I may possibly be inclined to make an exception.

Mrs. Hay might he seen gliding along in another direction with a very thick lace veil over her face. She opened the bank-house door without"], [265, "SISTERS AND BROTHERS. 253 using the ceremony of knocking, and proceeded at once to Mrs. Mortimer's snuggery. \" A little bit of business brought me here this morning,\" Mrs. Hay said, with a smile, after the usual greetings and laying aside some of her wraps, as if preparing for a longish visit. \" I think I saw Ellen ? \" she observed, parenthetically, and looking at Bessie. \" Indeed ? She has been here, and with you ! I am rejoiced, I am sure. And your father tells me that she is not going to run away* from us all just yet ! That is well.\" \" To say truth, I fancied \u2014 I thought you might be disappointed about it,\" timidly suggested Bessie. \" My dear ! And why so ? Oh ! \u2014 you mean on account of my poor darling Alick ! \u2014 well \u2014 yes \u2014 I do confess that for his sake I might be excused from desiring her absence. Not but that I fully rely on its being a mere boyish whim \u2014 nothing, more at all ; and, indeed, love, it is a pity she should encourage attention which can end in nothing, and which certainly draws every one's notice. But it is not of this I come to speak, but rather of Granville \u2014 dear Granville ! Now, my dear sister, you know me thoroughly, I am sure.

She nodded to her aunt, but only said \u2014 \" Mrs. Mortimer ! I am come to look after you ! So many visitors, one after another ! Oh, fye, Mrs. Mortimer !

I assure you it does not hurt ; \" and Mrs. Mortimer laid a detaining hand on her daughter-in-law, looking humbly at the same time towards Miss Mortimer. \" I trust what I have to say will do no harm,\" murmured Mrs. Hay. \" We were lamenting over your brother's \u2014 over Granville's unfortunate scruples, my dear,\" observed Mrs. Mortimer. \" Indeed !

A spell ! \" murmured poor Mrs. Mortimer to herself, moving her fingers, in a hurried manner, and looking distressed and troubled. The letter contained a request for Mrs. Hay to recommend some clever man, who could and would devote three hours daily in reading with an invalid young nobleman, obliged to reside for some time in London for the benefit of first-rate surgical assistance. Liberal terms were offered, but it was wished that the gentleman should only* come daily and not live in the house. \"Doesn't it strike you, that this would be the very thing now? Granville could take lodgings. His being in town would suit him for his literary- occupa tions, as he himself told me the other day. What do y*ou say ? \" said Mrs. Hay."], [271, "SISTERS AND BROTHERS. 259 \" The very thing. He must accept it, of course,\" observed Miss Mortimer, decidedly. \" Is it soon ? Must he go directly ? He has been away so long and now \" The poor mother's eyes were dim with tears as she thought of so soon losing Granville's thoughtful attentions. \" Come, Mrs. Mortimer ! pray, don't allow your maternal feelings to interfere with your son's real good.\" \" Don't look piteous at him, for goodness' sake, but encourage his accepting and going; the sooner the better,\" said her daughter. \" Indeed, Eliza is right, but I know what a trial it is to you. Yet, as you value his future happiness, send him away-, urge him to go.\" After a little further consultation, it was agreed that Mrs. Hay should enclose the letter with a note from herself, urging on him the desirableness of his undertaking the work. It must be lest to him to communicate it or not to his mother and sisters. So reserved and sensitive as he was, it would be knocking the whole thing over, were they to say they had talked about it and settled it, before he was even consulted. Miss Mortimer's keen eyes failed to discover if Granville had heard anything, when they met at tea that evening. Except that he was, perhaps, a shade more grave and silent, there was no outward sign of difference. After tea he disappeared. But as he s 2"], [272, "260 UPS AND DOWNS. often did so no observation was made. Indeed it was one of the Mortimer rules and customs for each member of the family to take his or her way, and to act with entire independence, no remarks or questioning being the consequence. \" I am so very sorry ! I do so wish John would come ! Almost every evening you haA*e been here it has so happened that he is absent. It is so dull ! \" Bessie remarked this, as tired out with hushing a fractious baby, she seated herself before a large and formidable basket of work, and found her brother-in-law Granville in quiet possession of the parlour. He was apparently in deep thought and very grave ; but he smiled slightly as she spoke. \"I didn't come for John \u2014 I didn't think of him, in fact. I came to inquire after you \u2014 and to enjoy the quiet and the calm I always find here.\" He sighed and fell into silence again, which she was too much occupied in her sewing, to break directly. Presently, however, she uttered what was in her thoughts. \" I wonder where John is ! \" and then sighed an answer to her own query, for Granville did not seem to hear. \" Well, I shall miss this place, I shall miss you, Bess,\" he soon said, looking round with a long sigh."], [273, "SISTERS AND BROTHERS. 261 \" Miss me ! where are you going ? \" \" To London, possibly.\" \" London ! what for ? Granville, why don't you be a clergymstn, and live in that nice parish ? \u2014 you could marry and have a home of your own, and \" \" Take Holy Orders, in order to marry and live comfortably ! eh, Bessie, is that your doctrine ?

I am so sorry ! You are so kind to me, but I can't help you a bit \u2014 or comfort you,\" and she let her work drop, looking wistfully- at him. His deep eyes were singularly troubled and excited. He made a few steps to and fro, and sat down again, seeming about to speak, but did not do so. \" London ! \" she repeated. \" Well, I suppose you will like the society there. So many learned and clever men \" \" Bessie,\" he said abruptly, and at the same time giving the fire a hearty stirring up, \" Bessie, can't you prevail on El on your sister, not to go to Blair?\" \" I ! \u2014 not to go to Blair !

Bessie gazed in surprise and perplexity at his face, now turned towards her. \" But how do you know ? Have you seen Mrs. Wentworth? She was mamma's friend.\" \" So I have heard. I can hardly credit or under stand how. So unlike your mother, so very, very unlike. Yes ; I have seen her. I heard enough and too much, and at last I met her, once at Florence and again in a large party at Rome. She was immensely admired \u2014 the centre of attraction.

Well, that much \u2014 that portion of regard and interest due to the friend of early years I may reckon on, I suppose \u2014 or rather I might, for surely my coming, my living presence, has dispelled the feeling ?

She knocked once \u2014 twice \u2014 and no answer. Then she opened the door softly and went in. Her father was not there. The table was strewn with papers, an open tin box stood on a chair, and his writing desk on the table. The study or library opened into another room, also private to the Colonel. Probably he was gone there for a book or paper. While she waited her eye was caught by a case containing a picture, lying among the papers half hidden. She stooped to look at it. It was the side face of a young girl, very lovely in colouring and expression. \"Ellen,\" was written in gold letters beneath, and a lock of auburn hair, perhaps a shade lighter than her ow*n at present, lay curled in an open paper and in her father's writing \u2014 \" My dear, dear Ellen's hair.\" Tears stood in her eyes. \"And does he \u2014 did he ever love me \u2014 me so? And oh, father, why, why* or what shall divide us so cruelly now ? \" Her whole heart softened towards him, at this un expected proof of hidden love.

I was occupied, busy about old business affairs, and it is not pleasant to be surprised,\" he said in a quieter tone, but casting suspicious and inquiring glances from the case in his hand to her face. Then placing it in his desk and locking it, he took his chair and wheeled it opposite to another to which he motioned her. He cleared his voice and threw about some papers in evident perturbation, and not able to recall the composure or dignity he wished. She sat upright and still, and very, very pale, aU loving impulse, ad affectionate yearning, frozen into icy rigidity. Her inward thought was \"If it was me, that woman's shadow is between us, and he no longer sees me.\" A feeling very like pity for his delusion arose, and when he at last asked her a"], [284, "272 UPS AND DOWNS. question the tone of her voice was soft and gentle, though her look was hard. She said, \"I don't understand \u2014 what do you mean ? \" \" I mean,\" and his face flushed up as he held out a paper, and his finger trembled as he pointed to something written on it. \" I mean, is that, or is it not, your writing ?

She was no longer young, yet at times she was inclined to let her dignity stoop to her affection, and do the desired work rather than leave her charges. Another motive urged her to this ; she knew the real motive of putting the alternative before her was, iii fact, to force her to go, when a girl of Mrs. Hay's educating was to take her place, or rather the present housemaid's place, and the same person was expected to attend on Miss Raymond. Nursing there would be none in future. Nurse succeeded in making Ellen open her door ; but she found that nothing but the quiet she craved would be of any use. So after looking about and making things comfortable, she left her with a promise to explain her necessary absence from the dinner-table to the Colonel.

And as soon as ever her back was turned, I just let them have it again. Your mamma aUowed it, I know ! \" \" Is that the only time she has been here, Nurse ? \" \" I dare say not. But I don't know, seeing I keep myself to myself pretty much, and am seldom out of the nursery. Then your dear sister was here, wanting sorely to see you, as I told you, and she saw"], [294, "282 UPS AND DOWNS. her papa, and sat a bit with him and so did Mr. John. Indeed he took his tea with master last night and sat here quite late, talking \u2014 Robert said, they were quite in confab for hours, and that the tea stood cold in their cups \u2014 just as men do when there's no ladies there, you see. Missed you, I warrant; and Mr. John asked me quite particular after you and your symptoms, and I saw he wished he could see you. But I knew fresh air would do you more good than doctor's stuff. Do'ee dress yourself and go out. Take the little girls out for company. They '11 be sure and behave.\" Ellen allowed nurse to fetch her bonnet and shawl, and mechanically dressed herself. Before leaving her room, however, she locked up her father's letter, murmuring to herself, \"I see now who is my kind friend ! But his motive ? It is all a mystery, and I may be sure mischief is at the bottom for me.\" Then her movements became as hurried as they were slow before. Directly she felt the pleasant ah*, she was eager and restless to be out \u2014 to take a long walk somewhere. But where ? The little girls wanted to go and search for -flowers. Primroses must be in ther prime, and daffodils might possibly be found in a certain orchard. But Ellen could not decide which road to take, and at last, strangely enough, chose one which of necessity led quite through the centre of the town."], [295, "OVERTURES OF PEACE, AND P. P. C. VISITS. 283 Just as they passed the bank house the door opened, and Ellen visibly started. It was Miss Rosamond Mortimer, looking very pretty in her fresh and gay spring attire, and in that, as in all other ways, a contrast to Ellen, who was carelessly and badly dressed in a winter bonnet decidedly the worse for wear. She was looking thin too, and had not a shade of colour. \" Glad to see you out. Aunt Hay gave a deplorable aceOunf of you. So you wouldn't see any medical man either ? Well, you look palish. Lovely weather, isn't it. Poor Granville is envying us here, and doesn't think the trees in the parks half so pretty as our lanes, he says.\" \" Parks ! Where is he then ? \" \" Oh, didn't you know ? How very odd ! Why he has been gone just a week, I think \u2014 no, not quite \u2014 let me see \" \" Gone to hve in London ? I did hear some report of the sort, but I did not believe \u2014 I \" \"Oh, quite true. And it is a good opening for him. He means to run down again just to pack up the books and things he lest behind. One misses him very much though, and for our Easter ball it will be dreadful, for John is to be away too. But I detain you, good-morning.\" \"Let us turn back and go to the lane, as yon wish for primroses,\" said Ellen, turning round as she spoke."], [296, "284 UPS AND DOWNS. \" But now we are here \u2014 and you had rather go this way, Nelly,\" observed Ruth, holding her hand. \" I don't care now \u2014 I mean, I had rather go to the lane. I want some flowers, too. Come, walk fast out of this detestable street, or we shall be meeting some one.\" \" Didn't you expect to meet some one, NeU?\" asked Hetty, saucily. \" I thought you came on purpose to meet cousin Alick, or, perhaps, Miss Moore.\" \" Then you were mistaken, Hetty,\" said Eden^ gravely. Luckily for Ellen the hedges were too full of treasures to make her utter silence and dulness observable. She did feel very dull ! Yet it was a more than commonly beautiful day ; and at any other time its sweet and bright colouring, the effects of light cloud shadows and the hits of exquisite pure green and the rich warm tints of the newly ploughed up earth \u2014 the gladsome songs of busy birds, and the hum of the bee already deep in spring flower harvest, would have filled her mind with pictures. For Ellen had an artist's eye, and no sign given by Nature was unnoticed by her. To-day, however, she could not lift her mind to look, far less enjoy. She was conscious only of a dreary sense of apathy. She knew \u2014 yes, as she leant against a gate while the children gathered"], [297, "285 OVERTURES OF PEACE, AND P. P. C. VISITS. flowers, she confessed to herself that it was Rosa mond's news which had fallen on her like lead. She had not known before how the hope, the chance of meeting, of, perhaps in some unforeseen way, falling into good understanding and getting a smile or a word spoken in a tone of voice she longed to hear ; she had not known how all this had seemed to keep her up. How this very day her coming out at all had this secret wish closely hidden and folded up among other motives. Now, all was gone \u2014 all over. He was gone ! Not even a farewell look or word ! She tried to recall what had been their last meeting ! Then, walking on, she roused herself to cast it off and waste not another thought, far less regret, on the subject. Blair \u2014 Blair alone must be her hope in future. Poole, and all belonging to it, must be blotted out. Nonsense ! She disliked the Mortimers every one of them. There was no excep tion. They and she never could assimilate. So she forced herself to search for blossoms, and chat lightly to the children ; and when they looked up pleased and surprised, she said, the sight of the flowers and the lovely singing birds were enough to shake the blue devils out of any one. When they proposed making a famous bunch for Lisa, she agreed, and moreover promised to leave it at the door. Which accordingly they did, finding Bessie and the children all out, as they should be"], [298, "286 UPS AND DOWNS. on such a day. Cheered and encouraged by her unwonted sympathy and cheerfulness, which they did not observe was forced, the two children held tightly one by each of her hands, and chatted freely and merrily. She promised them either a game at cards, or a story for the evening, which Ruth pronounced would mark it as a white day altogether, and wishing that the weather was always fine, and prim roses always grew in the hedges, they reached North House garden gate. The Colonel and Mrs. Hay were walking in the garden, which was well worth looking at for its very splendid plot of anemones and other spring flowers. Robert was deservedly famous for his gardening performances, and very proud he was of the whole thing. There was no professed gardener kept, only* a common labouring man, under Robert. The meeting between father and daughter was all the stiffer for the presence of the lady. But Ellen seemed to be determined to throw off any constraint on her part, and talked fast about their walk, and about the garden show, answering Mrs. Hay's gentle inquiries after her health carelessly enough. Colonel Raymond was visibly surprised and pleased. He drew nearer and talked too, and then aster a little hesitation, scarcely looking towards Ellen, he proposed that the whole party should go into the house and have an early tea, declaring he had dined at Sir John Wood's lunch, where he had been"], [299, "OVERTURES OF PEACE, AND P. P. C. VISITS. 287 calling, and adding some polite words about knowing ladies' taste for early tea. Ellen smothered a heavy sigh, at this unexpected result of her civility. But feeling that she owed her father something for his forbearance, from whatever mistaken cause it sprang, and however hard it was to be forced to acquiesce by silence in the supposition of her guilt, where she could not prove her innocence, she resolved to try and please him, or at least not displease him for this one evening. But it was hard work. Very hard, when Mrs. Hay hi her peculiarly impressive, confidential, and charming manner, inquired about Mrs. Wentworth, and when Ellen's visit to Blair was likely to take place. Perhaps her keen eye saw this was not safe ground, and she soon shifted and began to speak of Hetty and Ruth and school, and then of the Mortimer family in general, skilfully avoiding the sharp corners. AU at once, as a natural conse quence, she went off to Jamaica, and riveted even Ellen's unwilling attention by her description of old scenes there \u2014 scenes in which she and the Colonel had acted together, so that his memory was also kindled and he waxed warm and chatty. Nothing could be more cleverly managed. Nothing was alluded to which could annoy, and the con versation did not flag. Ellen confessed her a very clever woman, with rare powers of fascination where"], [300, "288 UPS AND DOWNS. she was not well known. This mental confession and reservation led her again to pity, rather than blame her father, and she tossedl ong, restless, and uneasy on her pillow that night, revolving the many ways in which her undutifulness and lack of agreea bility had served to strengthen the charm he always felt in Mrs. Hay*. \"Is it too late now to win him back ? Could I do so ? \" and she felt conscious of some power, if she would encourage it, and she longed very much to love her father, and be] loved by him. That, would indeed make her life different. That picture \u2014 that lock of hair ! What could it mean ? Why was he so agitated and so angry ? Yet after all, it was natural. He was full of the idea of her having secretly obtained money, money which was to be advanced by a mere stranger \u2014 he was angry with her \u2014 that accounted for his manner. He had been kind afterwards. As far as he could know, he was kind and forbearing. If he would let her, she could love him. Resolutions rounded off into hopes, till an airy and bright structure was raised in the air. But soon it came tumbling down, for how were all the rumours, false and exaggerated, to be done away with \u2014 Mrs. Hay not always as she was to-night, and John Mortimer, and much \u2014 much besides \u2014 how could it be surmounted ? Yet \u2014 and Ellen prayed fervently, and with tears, as the thought arose \u2014 she did hope, that a day might"], [301, "OVERTURES OF PEACE, AND P. P. C. VISITS. 289 come, even here in this life, when she might clear herself to him, confess and be absolved. Ellen's resolutions were not destined to be proved yet, for the next day she felt very ill. Whether worry and trouble, or something more purely physi cal, was the cause, it was not easy to determine. It was a time of year when people are apt to be ill, and much sickness was about. Nurse was uneasy and wished for advice, but Ellen steadily refused to see her brother-in-law, and Dr. Moore's presence as medical adviser in that house was pronounced to be impossible. She was slightly delirious, and oftentimes lay apparently insensible, in a kind of coma. Mrs. Hay resolutely pushed her way into the sick room, and once there, she insisted on remaining sole watcher for one night. Ellen was too ill to resist, if, indeed, she was aware of it. Nurse was rebuked for disrespect, in ven turing to oppose the measure. Nurse and Mrs. Hay agreed in nothing. If one wished for cooling treatment, the other considered stimulants and heat the right thing, and so on. They were holding a whispering argument one day when Bessie came in, looking wan and haggard, and very little less ill than her sick sister. On being told that Ellen persisted in refusing to see her husband, she fixed her eyes steadily and sadly on her. Ellen coloured up and said : VOL. I. V"], [302, "290 UPS AND DOWNS. \"No, Bessie, I can't. It is horrid to have a doctor relation \u2014 don't you understand ? \" \"Yes; I understand,\" was the answer, in a strangely quiet, almost dry tone, with her eyes stid fixed on her sister's flushing face, herself pale as marble. \" Ellen is right, Aunt Hay,\" she added, and turning towards Mrs. Hay, \" it is not desirable, perhaps not pleasant, as she says. Why should not Dr. Moore be sent for?\" \" My love, surely after all that is said, what would John think ? Oh, dear, no : rather than that Colonel Raymond would, I am sure, send to Silver ton.\" \u2022\u2022 I don't see that. John would not \u2014 could not object, I am sure.\" \"Pardon me, my dear love, but from what he said to me, I feel sure he would feel himself peculiarly aggrieved. Ellen's feelings are too sensi tive, too delicate ; but it woidd be right to overcome them. AVe must not let feelings run away with us.\" Eden turned away with a look of disgust, and the flush fading, her face was seen in all its waste of flesh and fadure of tint. Bessie was a little shocked. She sighed heavily, and as she took Ellen's hot hand and pressed it to her lips, she half whispered : \"Pray, send for Dr. Moore, or why not Mr. Lawrence, whom John says is really clever?\""], [303, "OVERTURES OF PEACE, AND P. P. C. VISITS. 291 \" He is always tipsy,\" remarked Mrs. Hay. \"What, the man living in that village \u2014 that rough creature?\" exclaimed Ellen. \"No; let me alone. Leave me to Nurse. Nurse, and quiet, will do all I need. Only leave me to her,\" she added, rather fretfully. And Bessie signed to Mrs. Hay to follow her out of the room, whispering that she was weak, and excitement was very bad for her. Luckily for Ellen some letters from Jamaica claimed all Mrs. Hay's time and attention, and her wish of being left to Nurse and quiet was fulfilled, Bessie only paying such short and hurried visits as she could snatch time for, having dismissed all her servants but one and a small girl. When she came she always looked ill and worn, and stdl she bent the same steadfast, pitying, yet sometimes half reproachful look on Ellen. Youth and a good constitution battled bravely against disease, and without medical aid Ellen grew better, and again sat up in her mother's chair and enjoyed the lovely flowers with which the grim Robert supplied her. A letter from Mrs. Wentworth bearing the date of Blair, did most towards her recovery. Mrs. Wentworth was at home and impatient to welcome Ellen there. She must set off directly. It was joy to think of it\u2014 joy to prepare, at first in thought, or slowly sorting and arranging a few trifles suited to her strength. U2"], [304, "292 UPS AND DOWNS. Mrs. Hay took away Hetty and Ruth to Mrs. Harding. Nurse was to leave. Old sores and worries again came to sting her and strengthen her desire to go. Yet she was bitterly upset one evening, not having got her usual strength back, to find her father concluding that she left home for ever, that Blair would henceforth be her home \u2014 taking the old half-repented threat, in earnest ! She was too proud to say she regretted it, or to plead to stay. True his stipulated conditions still remained unful filled. She had never directly, or, indeed, indirectly, begged Mrs. Hay's pardon: yet, of late, she had striven to endure more meekly, and Mrs. Hay had so far triumphed as to gain her point, and Ellen had then no resentment. She had believed things would be better. Aster a visit to her friend, she should return and find home happier. But instead of this she was banished \u2014 sent away in disgrace. She was wished away. Then her tears dried up, and the old haughty defying spirit came back. Ellen packed and arranged her parting gifts with a hard and assumed indifference. And the days sped on, till she reached the one before that fixed for her journey. Rainy weather had set in, but she scrupulously called and left farewell cards every where. The boxes were filled and only waiting for Robert's good cording. She had put away under his charge several articles of her room furniture,"], [305, "OVERTURES OF PEACE, AND P. P. C. VISITS. 293 which she considered peculiarly her own, as belong ing once to her mother. It remained to take a last walk round the garden, and to see Bessie. In heavy, soaking rain, she walked once round each bed, and on each path, and she took it for an omen, that this last leave-taking should have been in such dismal rain. Then lingering, as if unwilling, she begged Robert to conduct her with his lantern to Bessie's house. The streets were in miserable plight, and Poole was peculiarly unpleasant in such rain. They had gone half the way in silence, but as Robert stopped for a moment to throw more light on a large puddle, Ellen made some remark about the rain which had lasted for two or three clays. \" Can't think whatever she 's up to,\" was the answer, in a gruff voice, but with a peculiar sparkle in the eye. \" Spring is just a female and no mistake. Here she came prancing in so gay and smiling, tempting a body to trust to her, and now, after two days ugly wind, fit to cut one in half, here she is indulging in shower baths! Don't see no sense in spring ; winter and summer are more to be counted on; but spring \u2014 well, as I said, she is a female, and that 's all about it.\""], [306, "294 UPS AND DOWNS. CHAPTER XIX. THE LAST POOLE VISIT. \" Don't wait, Robert, I don't know how long I may be here. Yet, I don't know \u2014 well, come in an hour or rather more,\" said Miss Ray*mond, hesitating, and remembering the lack of servants in Bessie's house. \"Is your mistress up-stairs?\" Ellen inquired, as she took off her clogs in the passage, and gave the girl her dripping umbrella. \" She is, ma'am ; in the nursery she is. Master's out \u2014 I '11 light you ma'am ; and she proceeded with her candle. Bessie was walking up and down, with a rumpled collar and rough hair, trying to pacify her baby. The room was what the girl emphatically and truly termed a \"rummage,\" and she bustled about to clear a chair for Ellen, heaping children's clothes and toys in confusion on the table. \" So you are really going ! \" Bessie said, while she threw one arm round her sister's neck and kissed her, and then again soothed the child. \" Yes ; I go to-morrow. I could not go without seeing you.\" 55"], [307, "THE LAST POOLE VISIT. 295 \" No ! \u2014 John is out \u2014 gone for two days on busi ness,\" she observed hurriedly, and hiding a rising blush by bending low over her baby. \" I could not leave the house to-day. I wished so much to come and see you ! I am glad you thought of coming. Thank you for it, Ellen!\" and she held out her hand. \"Thank me!\" she suddenly stopped, and went to the cot in which lay little Lisa, half asleep. She kissed her and stroked the fair silky hair tenderly, murmuring some affectionate words. Meanwhile Bessie put the baby into its cradle, and then drawing in two chairs she begged Ellen to sit by her. They were both silent for some little time. Once Ellen sighed very deeply, and Bessie turned and looked at her. \" I suppose,\" Ellen said, speaking rapidly, \"I suppose you know I am leaving this for good, for ever ? \" \"No \u2014 no \u2014 no! I neither suppose nor believe that, Ellen! Yet,\" she added in a low and almost solemn voice and laying her hand on her sister's, \"I feel it is right you should go now \u2014 for some time, perhaps even a long visit. But not for always, Ellen!\" \" My father says so. Yes ; hut he does indeed. And what is there to prevent it. Who cares to keep me here ? at least, except yourself, not a soul ! And there I, even I, may be happy ! \" \"But you will feel \u2014 I know you will, that you"], [308, "296 UPS AND DOWNS. can be happy, in your own home. I can't under stand and I grieve .\" \" No, Bessie, you don't and you can't understand ! Be sure you cannot. Don't grieve. Be happy*, be content, you know nothing of me. I will not sub mit to be crushed and driven! I can make a way for my*self: other places besides this narrow Poole are open to a determined spirit ! You and I are so different.\" \" Very different, indeed,\" said Bessie, quietly and sadly. \" Too different, at least in feehng, about some things \u2014 Why is it so?\" and bending down, tears fell on her sister's hand. Ellen's lips quivered a little, but she shook it off, and presently said \u2014 \" Bessie, do you remember the old days when we first ' came out,' and talked to each other of our partners ? Don't cry so \u2014 oh, Bessie, don't let me think I make you unhappy ! You say you are glad I should go.\" \" So I am \u2014 oh, yes, Ellen, it is right. But I must say it this once \u2014 for I know, and I hope \u2014 indeed, clear, I hope it \u2014 that you will return. To stay away for ever would be too horrible ! Only \u2014 dear, dear Ellen, if you do come back \u2014 leave me and mine alone.\" Her voice was suddenly quite steady, and she upturned her pale, sweet face, and looked at Ellen. \"I know now, why you objected to my marriage,"], [309, "THE LAST POOLE VISIT. 297 Ellen ! it is too late now. Leave me to all I have got, or might have.\" \"What do you mean? What are you saying? What are you thinking of ? \" \" Only that you are right to go away \u2014 to stay away for a time. I shall pray for you, and for us all, and \" A loud sob here broke in, and she pressed her hand tightly on her heart. \" Ellen ! we have always been friends, as well as sisters \u2014 I must say this once, I think you wrong in many ways ; yes, though I know you are sorely tried. Your own heart will tell you what I mean. If you don't alter, you never, never can be happy, and we must all be miserable \u2014 very miserable ! \" Ellen looked, and felt surprised at Bessie's very unusual manner. She was also hurt \u2014 pained to the heart. Nothing is perhaps more terrible than reproval from a gentle and timid person, who would naturally do everything to spare another's feelings. Condemnation blent with love is a divine attribute. These loving, but stern, unflinching words from Bessie gave almost intolerable pain to Ellen. In vain she strove to throw off the impression, and resist all outward emotion. For a few moments she could find no voice. At last she burst out vehe mently and wddly : \" No doubt I am a great sinner! but, it is a strange time to throw it all in my face. Very strange! You have got hold of some trumped up stories about me, I see ! I"], [310, "298 UPS AND DOWNS. expected otherwise from you \u2014 you, Bessie ! But, never mind, I am used to hard blows. Well, I won't forget your parting lecture.\" \" Ellen, Ellen ! \" was all that Bessie could answer, in a tone both imploring and deprecating ; her dis tress was evidently great, now that the righteous impulse which had moved her to open her mind had been obeyed. \" Forgive me, Ellen ! don't think me unkind.\" Now it was Ellen's turn to resume her wonted office. She stilled her own strong agitation by great effort and comforted her sister \u2014 whispering her to \" forget it, and talk no more in that manner. After all she was right, and Ellen herseU wrong. She was very wrong, very wicked, and when they were separated, Bessie must try and think better of her, and withhold judgment, for that she knew not all.\" At last Bessie looked up with something like a smile : \"Can I \u2014 shall I, try to say any-thing to papa, or to Mrs. Hay ? Perhaps, when you are away, I might do some good.\" \" Never ! Don't say anything, please. But I will again warn you against that woman, though she is your husband's aunt, and has the reputation of being an ' excellent creature.' Don't trust too much to her words, Bessie.\" \" Well, I will be careful, I promise,\" and her grave face returned. \" Do you know, Granville"], [311, "THE LAST POOLE VISIT. 299 half frightens me about Mrs. Wentworth ? I wonder where he can have picked up his notions ? \" \" Mortimer prejudice ! They are all so unwilling to allow merit to any one not a Mortimer. Nothing else, Bess ! Pray, don't listen to all you hear of me or of my \u2014 surely, Bess, I may say \u2014 our friend? You haven't forgotten ' Worthy,' mamma's \u2014 our friend and companion, and the sweetest and love liest of women ? \" They chatted for a time about this and old recollections connected with Mrs. Wentworth and their old home, till Bessie looked at her watch, and exclaimed in surprise at the hour, adding that she feared she must have left Granville long alone, and waiting for her. Ellen started a little, and coloured up, but she only remarked in a quiet voice, \" I thought he was in London.\" \" Yes ; he was so. But he returned yesterday, and he is to leave again the day aster to-morrow. He promised to come in this evening, for having so much to do for the children, I really have no time during the day to see or enjoy any one.\" \" Robert must be come for me. I will say good bye, and you can go to him,\" said Ellen, rising with nervous haste. \" Stay a little longer ! Let us both go down,\" pleaded Bessie. Robert was not come, and Ellen was persisting in"], [312, "300 UPS AND DOWNS. going alone, refusing to enter the drawing-room, for, she said, \" it was late, and high time to be at home : she should meet Robert half way most likely.\" Bessie remonstrated and entreated, and at last suddenly opening the parlour door, she called Gran ville. \" Do come and make Ellen stay till Robert is here. Or won't y*ou go with her ? She ought not to go alone now, ought she ? \" Ellen looked vexed, and gave Granville a distant greeting in consequence. She said she would not allow him to go out on such a night. Rather than that, she would wait longer. He did not urge it, but followed the sisters into the room, with a grave, reserved manner. Ellen rattled on about trifles, with a heightened colour, a strong contrast to Bessie's pale and subdued looks and manner, and when very soon Robert was announced, she hastily kissed Bessie, offered her hand without looking at him to Granvdle, and calling out, \" Farewell,\" ran out of the room. As she reached the door, Granville was there too : \" You won't let me go with you ? \" \" You see I have an escort. Why come out in the rain. Well \u2014 if not actually dropping at this moment, it is both dirty and damp. Bessie and you expected a pleasant evening together. No ! I won't disturb you ; thank you.\" \" And you go to Blair to-morrow ? \" he said, detaining her hand, which he had taken once more."], [313, "THE LAST POOLE VISIT. 301 \" I do. I always do as I say I will. Besides \u2014 ask Bessie ! She approves. So does my father.\" He sighed. \" I wish I could hope any words of mine could weigh with you. But Well ! Good-bye, Ellen ! Good-bye.\" He pressed her hand in a lingering way, nor did she withdraw it. It was like old days, his manner of calling her Ellen. It was a pleasant parting token, and she did not wish to run the risk of marring it by further discussion. She returned the good-bye, and signed to Robert to go on with the lantern. This was her last Poole visit. A pleasant fire, just the right size, compact and lively, gave welcome to Ellen, as she went to her own beloved room to take off her wet things. She sighed as the flame trembled and quivered on each familiar object, remembering it might be the last evening she should call that room her own. Her visit had left a painful impression. Bessie's manner and words, while conscious how truly her conduct in some ways deserved it, startled and alarmed her a little. She did not know exactly to what Bessie alluded. That she should learn at last to believe her own husband's and his aunt's version of the story, Ellen too well knew her sister's disposi tion to be astonished at. In fact Bessie had believed in her far longer than she expected, for Mrs. Hay's iufluence was immense, and strengthened by the"], [314, "302 UPS AND DOWNS. reverence for persons older than herself, which was a strong point in Bessie's character. In nothing had these twin sisters differed more than this temper. One being meek and obedient without question, her unbounded faith in others set over her, simplifying and as it were narrowing all her duties and aspira tions. The other, keen to perceive defects, doubtful and apt to cavil with a strong and determined will, which nothing but high principle or the deepest love could daunt and control. Bessie inherited her mother's temper and mind, as weU as her style of beauty ; Ellen was after another type, and strongly resembled her mother's only sister. From very early childhood, the mother had been convinced, that this singularly loving and interesting child was difficult to deal with. But, as under her watchful care the rougher parts smoothed and toned down, and, thanks to this care and love, she escaped being soured or being dubbed \" the naughty child,\" Mrs. Raymond failed to note the inner working of the girl's mind. She felt her to be strong either for good or evil, and believing the last to be put far from her, she in her declining strength, leaned towards Ellen's higher and stronger mind \u2014 all the more so, perhaps, for her sound and perfect health, aud commended the timid Bessie to her care ; strangely overlooking the many indica tions of the unquiet spirit which was even then beating against its prison bars, she only feared for Bessie's sensitive mind and frail body. When the"], [315, "THE LAST POOLE VISIT. 303 mother left them, Ellen at once and naturally to both assumed the elder sister ; at least in most things. For now and then, on rare occassions, when Bessie's strict principles were threatened by Ellen's more daring spirit, she would throw aside all yielding and timidity, and with a solemn sternness which nothing could move, Bessie reproved or advised. At such moments Ellen became the disciple rather than the protector. Ellen's pride and the dash of coquetry which was innate to her often rather shocked her sister ; while, on the other hand, Bessie's matters of fact, prudence, and lack of spirit, and her ten dency to dawdle and mope often irritated Ellen. In spite of all they truly loved each other. Even Blair faded out of her thoughts this evening, as, tired and anxious, Ellen threw herself into her high chair and thought of their parting, and all the difficulties and troubles which gathered round her, making her now virtually a banished child ; and as she keenly felt (wincing as it occurred to her), the subject of general condemnation and wonder in Poole. There were moments when, with her passions roused, Ellen's heart seemed to beat high and almost rejoice in this battle against society : especially with those for whom she did not care. But, after all, this life of antagonism is not natural to the young, and in the solitude of her own room, she shrank from it in exceeding weariness and"], [316, "304 UPS AND DOWNS. disgust. Once again this night she revolved in her own heart, the possibility of confiding everything to her father. Surely he was her natural friend and protector, and if he knew all, bitterly as he still might blame her, he would shield her even from the consequences of her faults. She could bear this, she thought. Just reproof, with love, would be balm and comfort to her soul. Should she write \u2014 write a full history of herself from her first wrong step, and tell him all \u2014 even the wrong she had borne from others ? He must be bound to solemn secresy ; for Bessie's happiness must be secured, at all events \u2014 at least, as far as it was in any one's power ; and Ellen sighed as she recalled the increasing sadness, the evident marks of mourning, in that sweet young face she loved so well.

His very isolation and reserve had charmed her fancy, and as a very young child she had been in the habit of watching him silently ; rewarded sometimes, in a way precious to her heart and gratifying to her pride, by a word of approval, or a smile. But she knew that any such demonstration was sure to be followed by strange and excited words. He seemed to be drawn to her against his will ; to love her in spite of himself, while sometimes her very look and her voice, or more still, the sound of her name, would seem to annoy and agitate him beyond all control. She put this down to Mrs. Hay. Sbe believed that Mrs. Hay- cordially hated and feared her. There was a natural antipathy between them. And Mrs. Hay had all-powerful influence over the Colonel, even before his wife's death.

Twenty years ago, railroads were only beginning theh* career. Some persons considered such rapid travel ling in the light of presumption, and wouldn't risk their lives on any account. Others bewailed over the ruin they would cause to that stalwart race of red faced, bulky beings, the coachmen. The demorali sation of the whole country was predicted. But the monster rushed on, panting and shrieking, cutting his way through every county, till the whole land in its length and breadth is a vast iron net-work. Poole was out of the reach of any line, and as Colonel Raymond had long since sold his close carriage and horses, his daughter travelled by a good old-fashioned, fast-going, thoroughly uncomfortable mail coach. Robert was to mount guard outside, for the Colonel, though not given to concern himself much about his children's comforts, would on no account have it said that \" Miss Raymond \" was seen in a public conveyance unattended.

But, as the Colonel observed, that was only nine miles from Blair, and he could not suffer her to travel the other thirty-six miles alone. Robert, having seen his young lady's luggage safely stowed away, placed himself with his own grim smile on the coach-box, and if the coachman had never heard of the Raymonds before, he cer tainly gathered facts enough that day, at all events to give him a great idea of their original importance.

She and Alick exchanged a little joke at the opposite window, and she looked so well as she smiled and chatted that he could not turn his horse's head just then.

A man lighting the inn lamp \u2014 the panting, smoking horses, standing aside, while fresh ones were being led out by a wee urchin \u2014 all these objects were as so many pictures passing before her, taking light from her own serene state of mind.

Everything was bright and bearable under the influence of the hour. Hilton, a poverty-stricken, forlorn-looking place, seemed to her then, cheerful and pleasant. Suddenly, by one of those strange links of association which are so bound up in our life, all was changed, and her mind was carried back, as if by a flash, to a day long ago.

Groups of shrubs waved wildly* in the now high wind, looking like dark spectres, and the white stone vases glared in a ghastly- way as the carriage lamps threw their light for a moment on them. Then yellow lights appeared, \" all in a row,\" and Ellen knew the house was near.

She passed the butler and the footman, and felt herself clasped in a warm, impulsive embrace, while a soft voice whispered, \" Ellen ! my love ! You are welcome ! I have been uneasy, it is such a stormy night ! But I have you, and how well you look ! My dear child, to think you are here at last!\" Ellen could find no words.

But it mustn't, and shan't be said that I left my poor home for my rich friend ! I wish you were poor, Worthy ! I have often wished it lately.\" \" Thank you ! but I am content as I am. I doubt very much if poverty and I should suit each other.\" \" But seriously,\" resumed Ellen, \" I have some money of my very own \u2014 that is, I shall have in a few months, when I am twenty-one, though how much it is, I don't quite know,\" and she paused, looking grave. \"Your uncle left you each 5,000/., didn't he?\" said Mrs. Wentworth. \" Yes, but Well, whatever it is, it will be enough to dress me, and all ' that,' you see.

Let them see that I did not come to you for the loaves and fishes, as they dared insinuate.\" \" My dear, you need not punish me for the insinuation, by giving my poor hair such a spiteful pull,\" said Mrs. Wentworth, as Ellen, whde playing with her friend's soft, jetty hair, in her indignation unconsciously pulled somewhat hard. \" You are a proud minx, but, however, I agree. Shall we draw up a regular form of agreement, and have it sealed and signed ? Bread and butter and mutton, you said ? I hope I shan't transgress, and by mistake offer you to share a fowl or a partridge.\" They laughed and they chatted till Mrs. Went worth insisted on its being bed-time, which Ellen would not believe. \" It was so cozy, such a treat ! A little longer could do no harm.\" But Mrs. Wentworth was firm, and said she was bent on preserving Ellen's complexion. Nothing so destruc tive to good looks as night vigils. And after such a wearisome journey too, no, not even an adjournment to the dressing-room fire would she allow for that night. With many a gracious and winning word and caress, she left Ellen in her own room, begging her to ring for whatever she wanted. Watkins \u2014 of course, Ellen remembered \" Watty\" \u2014 would be"], [342, "330 UPS AND DOWNS. proud to wait on her, and was the same good, jealous, faithful creature as ever. But Ellen soon dismissed this favourite attendant, after a few rather forced civil words. The truth was, she never had liked her, nor was this feehng unreturned. Watkins could ill brook any one being very dear and very intimate with her mistress, over whom, hy well judged flattery and obsequious attention, mixed as it was with much real skill and kindness of heart, she had obtained more influence than was quite right. On her former visit, when younger in character as well as years, Ellen had felt some slight fear of this formidable lady's maid. She now resolved to begin on the safe side, by keeping up a due, though polite distance. One of the subjects on which she already found she could not quite agree with her friend, was the familiarity which existed between Mrs. Went worth and her one or two favourite attendants \u2014 a familiarity which had a large spice of despotic selfish ness in it, and leading to a manner which was very distasteful to Ellen. After listening quietly to Watkins' history of her dear lady's health, and replying to her questions, such as, \" Wasn't Mrs. Wentworth looking well and lovely ? not a bit altered ; and wasn't that velvet dress becoming ? \" &c. Ellen bade her good-night, assuring her that she preferred undressing herself. When alone, she surveyed the room; this room which was to take the place of the old familiar"], [343, "EIGHT MILES AN HOUR TO HAPPINESS. 331 retreat at home! There was no evidence here of all the wealth and luxury which pervaded Mrs. Wentworth's own particular apartments or the sitting rooms. She never troubled herself about home affairs, but lest it to her servants ; and Ellen was prepared, by experience, not to find over much attention paid to comfort. The bed hangings were of damask, once handsome, but now faded. There was a splendid press of inlaid wood, costly and curious, but sadly out of repair, handles and locks alike imperfect. It was the same throughout, betraying an absolute lack of care or thought, for which splendour but dl makes up. Rather to her dismay, Ellen found that there was no bell \u2014 at least, none which would ring; but she determined to have aU these things put right to morrow, and with just one small sigh of regret, that she could not transport all her own comforts here, she rested on all the beauty and aU the love and charm of manner which fascinated her so entirely. Here she was at last at Blair ! Nearly forty mdes from the scene of her troubles. The sound of the raging wind, and the gushing rain, the shaking and rattling of windows, and the peculiar wailing sound which the wind made among the thick-set fir-trees, aud more than all, that dull, distant rumble, which she knew must be the sea, made her forget her fatigue, and the late hour- Wrapt in her own thoughts, she sat pulling out"], [344, "332 UPS AND DOWNS. her long hair, till all at once she jumped up, roused by a sudden impulse, and taking up her candle, quietly left her room, and found her well remem bered way to that of Mrs. Wentworth. She paused a moment outside the door, and listened. All was stdl. Watkins was gone. So she opened the door and said, \" Worthy ! are you asleep ? May I come in?\" \" Bless me, Ellen ! My dear child, what is it ? Frightened at the storm, or at the Abbey tales ? \" said Mrs. Wentworth sitting up in her bed. A small shaded lamp stood on a stand, and Ellen left her candle outside, and went to the bed side. She took Mrs. Wentworth's hands and kissed them, hiding her face in them. \" What is it, Ellen ? \u2014 What is it, Lena? for I shall go back to my old name. Are you frightened ? \" \" No \u2014 no ; not at all. But I could not sleep, Worthy, without a confession. I thought Watkius would be gone, and \" \" Confession ! Well out with it, before I am too sleepy to absolve my fair penitent.

No, child ; his mother is detestable, and he has no fortune. Pray \" \" I do not care for him \u2014 at least, in the sense you"], [345, "EIGHT MILES AN HOUR TO HAPPINESS. 333 mean. But, Worthy, you asked if I had no regret. Now \u2014 I answered, as I thought truly, that I had none, and I don't think I have. But it is not quite exactly honest and frank to say so either. Some times In fact, I don't understand myself, Worthy. Sometimes, it is anger and dislike, and sometimes the old feehng will come back, and though I do mean to give it up \u2014 for why should I care for one who despises me? \u2014 yet, perhaps, I am wrong in letting you suppose that I am entirely free \u2014 that is \" \" What is all this, Ellen? Who do you mean?

Not him, Ellen ? \" \" Yes,\" she answered in a very low voice. \" But don't be angry, Worthy, for I assure you I have made the most of it. I didn't like to deceive you in the least. But he and I are separated. You need not fear, \u2014 though you are utterly, entirely mistaken about him \u2014 his character, I mean.\" \"Never mind his character! Essentially moral and odious, no doubt,\" Mrs. Wentworth said, with some degree of fretfulness and anger in her tone. \" Forget him as soon as possible, I beg. Why he is even worse than the other !

And after all I was right, and your eyes were right. But yon have left Poole and all belonging to it. No more such nonsense. Good night, my dear love, good-night.\" Ellen kissed her face and kissed her hands, and partly reheved, partly troubled, she again crept through the dark and dismal corridor, and was right glad to reach her own room and stir the fire up to throw its cheery and comforting beams around. At Blair all her troubles were to have vanished. This was Blair. Even now the sound of her friend's sweet voice echoed in her ear, and the touch of her hand was still fresh on her brow. Why, then, did she feel grave and sad ? Did the shadow follow her, even here ?"], [347, "335 CHAPTER XXI. THE WITCH OF ASHBY CROSS. The wind had lulled. It had passed with the night, and the sun rose with a whispering breeze, which stirred the leaves gently ; the waves were less high and boisterous, though still white with foam, and telling the history of the past night. Blair HaU stood on high ground, and \"as the gardener observed, \" felt such breezes. He thought it must be the gales : they didn't always keep to their right time. They were late this season.\" When Ellen awoke and drew back the thick curtain, which had so well courted sleep to linger, shrouding the daylight and muffling all sounds of wind and storm, \u2014 when Ellen looked out, she saw Mrs. Wentworth in her garden costume, followed by her gardener, looking at the wreck of Ameri can shrubs and the destruction of some precious plants. \" 'Tis naught but trouble and vexation to have to deal with such a place,\" grumbled the man : \"just to see the Abbey, lying so snug in the valley, and"], [348, "336 UPS AND DOWNS. shut in by that belt of firs ! That 's something like a place, that is ! \" \" A sad wilderness now, Thomas.\" \" No denying of that, ma'am. But the wilderness is man's doing or neglect, and not the fault of the elements. Half the care I give this place, would keep that a paradise.\" Some of these remarks reached Ellen, who had opened her window to admit the soft air. Her breakfast was brought to her by a rosy faced village maiden, lately hired as under-house maid, and to whom she took a sudden liking, and determined to get her as her attendant, if possible. She lingered pleasantly over her cofl'ee, and then leisurely put her things away \u2014 a proceeding which differs wonderfully, in point of time, with different persons. While doing this she was struck by two pictures, which had not attracted her notice on the previous night. Now the light was full on them. One she immediately recognised as having hung in Mrs. Wentworth's own room on her last visit, and she knew it was \"Bertha Raymond,\" her mother, when a very young girl. There was one at North House, but it never gave Ellen much pleasure, beautiful as it was. It was so different from her recollection of her mother, as a pale, worn, and tearful woman, whose heart was said to be broken when her little son had died. The youthful, ripe bloom of the picture was too great"], [349, "THE WITCH OF ASHBY CROSS. 337 a contrast to her notion of her mother, and excited bitter regrets at the early withering of so much delicate beauty. But it was with deep interest she again looked at her mother in her girlhood, fresh and joyful, gentle and womanly, with gay animation expressed in her attitude. She was smiling amused at a kitten which was playing with her bonnet strings. It was indeed a fair face, and the artist had admirably combined contrast with harmony in the two portraits. The other was also a young girl, with sunny auburn hair. Her mother's hair was of a pale, golden tint. This one, Ellen Raymond, was bending over a book, and thereby showing a lovely profile, full of character and spirit. \" I must hear more of her history,\" thought Ellen, as she gazed earnestly at the picture. \"Poor Aunt Ellen ! there is some sad mystery about her, which has always puzzled me. I have only been allowed glimpses, but I will make Worthy tell me all. I wonder if I am at all like her ! Bessie is rather like mamma.\" Mrs. Wentworth was still engaged with her flowers and shrubs, when Ellen joined her. \" The wind did some mischief, I fear,\" Ellen remarked, lifting up a broken spray of Kalmia. \" Ah, indeed it did ; look here, \u2014 and here,\" said vol. i. z"], [350, "338 UPS AND DOWNS. poor Mrs. Wentworth, pointing to the damaged shrubs. \" My precious myrtle, too ! \" Ellen follow*ed her for some time from tree to shrub, and joined in the exclamations of regret and dismay, but though fond enough of flowers, EUen was not much of a practical gardener, and she weU knew that for the next hour or so, Mrs. Wentworth's atten tion would be devoted to the garden. So, casting a wistful eye on the green cliffs and the flag-staff, which were plainly seen from the higher part of the lawn, she said, \u2014 \" I think I shall take a run to the old cottage. I shall be back again before luncheon. I can't resist the temptation of the waves dashing over the rocks this morning : after last night they will be splendid, and they may be quite smooth again to-morrow !\" \"Yes, \u2014 very well, my dear. Yet stay, Ellen; you must not go, on any account, without an offering for Goody. You know of old her temper, and it is not improved. But a slice of meat or pudding has a wonderful effect : it acts like soda, and destroys the acidity, setting her off bubbling and efferves cing on old times ! \" \" Certainly, then, I must take some pudding to Goody. May I ask Mrs. Rasldeigh?\" A nod and a smile answered her. Ellen obtained the desired peace-offering from the housekeeper, and was very soon on her way to the cottage, with a well stocked basket swinging on her arm."], [351, "THE WITCH OF ASHBY CROSS. 339 The long stony lane leading from Blair Hall to the church at Ashby Cross, showed a few primroses, but nothing more. The banks on either side were high, and the lane was narrow and straight. Yet it was with a pleasurable feeling of expectation, that Ellen trod the well-known road. The pleasure of sitting on a rock and watching the splashing waves, led her on. She loved the fantastic cliffs, which as a child she had so often tried to draw on her lesson-books. The sand hills, the sea-pinks, and the mussel and cockle shells, all were delightful remem brances, interwoven with happy thoughts; and though she knew she must bitterly feel the change which had come over all since last she saw it, still she bounded on with intense expectation. The fresh sea breeze called up a briUiant colour, and blew about her hair in no unbecoming way. She arrived at the four cross-roads. The opposite one led to the cove, which was reached by a steep, step-like path, worn by frequent descents, in the cliff. The one to the left, led to the church, whose whitened tower, standing on an eminence, formed a beacon for sailors and fishermen at sea, and country people inland. It stood in the centre of a large burying ground, one side of which stretched out to the very edge of the cliff, and was enclosed by a low wall, composed of the round smooth pebbles found on the beach. The right-hand road led to the \"cottage on the 7. 2"], [352, "340 UPS AND DOWNS. rock,\" which was at the other and opposite side of the cove from the village of Ashby Cross. This cottage had been built by the Raymonds, very long ago, for the convenience of sending the children of the family for bathing. It had also been used for picnics. Latterly it had been inhabited by an old woman of doubtful reputa tion. Goody Fleet had in her youth been laundress at the Abbey. Poor Goody's temper had not been sweetened with age and trouble. She was bitter against every one, both the old family for leaving the place, and the new comers for daring to turn the Abbey into a farm. The whole village rejoiced when Mr Lewis offered her to live at the cottage rent free, finding he could get no paying tenant for it. It was whispered about Ashby Cross that Goody was not as she should be, and she was made to figure in many of the mysterious tales which caused the ignorant people to shudder. She and her old white cat were not liked at all, and such hubbub and commotion was some times raised by them, that Farmer Lewis was glad to get her away to the lonely cottage, where she could talk to the winds and waves, and keep the house aired. A handsome myrtle, flourishing in the saline and soft breezes, a china rose, and a wild, unpruned Virginian creeper, covered the cottage, even to the thatched roof."], [353, "THE WITCH OF ASHBY CROSS. 341 The front was to the road, divided from it by a neat little garden, well planted in with laurels. The green gate was kept chained by Goody, who said \" folks might come in the back way if they wished to see her.\" A good-sized yard lay on one side, and a lawn extended behind to a terrace walk, which was divided from the cliff by a wall, like that in the churchyard. A latch gate led out to a steep path, over-hanging the sea, and by which the cottage tenants could reach the beach or cove. In high or spring tides, the sea dashed its foam quite into the cottage lawn. It was a singularly wild and picturesque spot, and Ellen loved it for its own sake as well as for all the dear associations connected with it. Here she had stayed with her mother and Bessie and her little brother. Here Granville had made their acquaintance. Here, again, she had spent many an hour with Mrs. Wentworth, and while listening to her reading some bewitching poetry or tale, she had sketched every point and every curve, every little fishing boat or group of half dressed children, playing with shells or \" picking cockles.\" After rattling the gate in vain, Ellen walked round to the back entrance, and found Goody seated on a log of wood, peeling potatoes for her pig. She wore a thick linen cap, drawn very tightly round her face, and meeting with a mob under her chin. Her cotton gown was tucked up behind, display ing an old fashioned, quilted, patchwork petticoat."], [354, "342 UPS AND DOWNS. Large buckles fastened her shoes, and a clean and very bright, red cotton handkerchief was pinned over her bust tightly. So far, all was well. Her appear ance was tight and cleanly, hut when she raised her face to see who stood before her, Ellen thought she had seldom, or never, beheld so ill-favoured a coun tenance. Yellow, lean, and wrinkled, with huge bristly eyebrows, hiding piercing, small, dark eyes. Her nose long and sharp, and much hooked, almost meeting her chin, which was up-turned. Her under lip hung down, and the upper one sank in, for she was toothless. \" No' wonder,\" thought Ellen, \" that they call her a witch ! \" \" Good-day,\" she said gruffly, and without moving. \"If so be you be come to look at the rooms, y*ou must bide till I have opened the shutters. The wind was up last night, but it didn't blow me or the house away, after all,\" and she chuckled and grinned as she resumed her work. \"I didn't wish to see the rooms particularly, I know them very well. Goody, here is something which Mrs. Wentworth sends you.\" Goody snatched at the basket, and mumbled, \" Madam Wentworth ! 'Tisn't of her blood ye be, though; I know the cut of your face ! No one deceives me. Ye are a Raymond ! \" \" You are right,\" said Ellen, smiling. \" So, then, ye are come back, eh ? Well, and didn't I dream you would ? I said Ellen Raymond"], [355, "THE WITCH OF ASHBY CROSS. 343 would come back yet, in the flesh, and tell her own tale. Ha, ha ! and here ye be ! I bain't a feared, not I, and ye look bonny too, and not like a corpse a bit.\" \"A corpse! what are you talking of? Why, Goody, don't you remember me \u2014 two little girls and their mother ? My mother was Bertha Raymond of the Abbey \u2014 don't you know ? We came here for bathing \u2014 long ago. We used to play here on this lawn, and you were living in the village, and you washed all our clothes.\" \" Aye, aye ! madam gave me five shillings, and said she hoped better times were coming for all. La ! bless her, didn't I see Death sitting on her shoulder then, and that sickly boy too. I laughed in my sleeve,^I did, for I knew never, never, no better days would come to the Raymonds. The sins of the fathers go down from generation to generation, so parsons say, and the Raymonds were always a bad set, from the time when one of 'em took the Abbey lands from the good monks, and marched them all out to starve. Aye, and there's old Peggy Rogers, who heard her grandmother say, as how her grandfather telled her, that there was a mighty deal more done for the poor then, and how good and charitable they was at the Abbey. But your wicked ancestor just turned 'em out, and brought in a bad, rough, ill-living set. He didn't come to good, for he was murdered. You may see his image"], [356, "344 UPS AND DOWNS. on the tomb in the church at Alwington, for 'twas afore this here one was built. He was called Sir Gerald. The name has come down with ye, it seems. Hey now ! I see, by the spark in your eye, ye luke to hear of all these-- dead and gone folks. Ah ! ye 're a Raymond all over, I see.\" \"No great honour or gain, according to your account, Goody.\" \"No, indeed ! Well, the widow of that bad Sir Gerald tried all she could, poor soul ! to undo his mischief. Folks 'dored her, and thought her some saint. She said she'd build a church on the estate. The stones were brought and laid by her order \u2014 I can show you the very spot, I can \u2014 but when they came next morning to work, every single stone was clean gone. More was fetched, and again it all went; and this just went on for ever so many times, and at last they found the stones all laid on the hill by the cliff, and so she saw she wasn't allowed to build a church on that land, and the church was reared where it stands now, and a fine mark is the tower for the fishing-boats.\" \"Indeed, is that the legend?\" said Ellen, in terested in the story, but disconcerted at the woman's leer, and thoroughly malicious expression, as she glanced to note the effect of her words, and then fell to peeling potatoes again. Presently she began to unpack the basket. \" Aye, aye, these be good things. Madam Went-"], [357, "THE WITCH OF ASHBY CROSS. 345 worth is good to the poor when she is here ; she is no Raymond.\" \" What have the Raymonds ever done towards you, that you have so much dislike for them?\" \" Well, \u2014 nothing to me in particular, as you say. But I was fond of one of 'em, and that was her you take after. Once when she was ill, as a bit of a girl, I sat up o' nights, and I liked her, and she always liked me. She was used shamefully, and I don't like none of them concerned in it, not I ! Wasn't you here? let me see, I don't know rightly how long back. But I mind two young ladies riding through the place, and there was a sort of lad along side of them \u2014 tall and light haired. He was un common fond of his books, and used to sit for hours on the rocks. He only stayed a few days that time, but he was here as a boy for his health \u2014 I don't know his name. That was you and your sister, I guess. Did he marry either of you?\" \" No ; but his brother married my sister. Do you know, Goody,\" said Ellen, her face brightening up, \"I think one of these days I shall come and live here.\" Goody chuckled and wiped away a tear, which her eye was for ever shedding, though it was caused by no emotion either of sorrow or joy. \" When the sun shines on the roses and the sea is quiet, may be 'twould please you. Oh yes, you would stretch yourself out, as the gentry do, with"], [358, "346 UPS AND DOWNS. your books and y*our nonsense, and dawdle away ; but la ! bless fyou, when the spirits be out, and the water heaves, and roars, and dashes, and the very gulls take fright and keep to their nests, and the wind whines and whistles, or she blusters fit to pull down any waU, what would you do then, eh ? The winds do sometimes pipe a dismal ditty, I can tell you.\" \" Oh, I should like it much ! And now I wdl run to the old cove, and see all my favourite seats,\" she said, rising from the three-legged stool she had taken. \" You must have had a rough night of it, Goody,\" she added. \" Aye, aye ; but it didn't carry me off ! Perhaps I did take a flight on my cat\u2014 eh, Tony ? Did we whirl round and round the tower, old boy, or did we go and scratch out the farmer's seed, or poison the hens, eh ? Perhaps so, Tony,\" and she stroked the large cat, who purred an answer. \" But we warn't carried off this time \u2014 not yet \u2014 not yet ! \" and grinning hideoushz she hobbled off into the house with the dinner which Ellen had brought her. Remembering the old pleasure of reading to the accompaniment of the sea's monotonous chant, Ellen had provided herself with a book. But it is not at first, nor till one is more accustomed to it, that the music and play of the waves allow of reading or thinking, except in a very dreamy and desultory fashion. There is enough to do in watching every curl \u2014 each wave so like and yet so unlike another,"], [359, "347 THE WITCH OF ASHBY CROSS. or speculating on the probable distance which that high wall of water will reach, when it crashes over and sends in its tribute to the thirsty shell-fish \u2014 admiring the exquisite fall of spray, and the wide, clear line of horizon. Ellen found this : what with the waves, and the village children picking cockles, and two men mending a boat, she not only did not read, but would have found it difficult to say what had been her thoughts, so unconnected and dreamy they were. From her ancestress the builder of the church to poor Bessie toiling in the nursery at Poole \u2014 from her last visit here to all the vexations and troubles she had left behind her \u2014 her thoughts wandered to and fro. One thing she did settle, which was that she certainly ought to write to Bessie that very day \u2014 and that if she did not hurry back she would miss the post. So she turned, and again mounting the rock steps, said good-morning to Goody, who only grinned, and reached home just as Mrs. Wentworth was wondering where she was. \" I have ordered the carriage, and we will drive to the Abbey woods directly, Ellen. I know you are all impatience to see them.\" \" Thank you, but do you know I must say no \u2014 I must write to Bessie.\" \" Indeed ! that is provoking ! Well, but write a few lines \u2014 there will still be time for our drive. I have much to tell you.\""], [360, "348 UPS AND DOWNS. \" I ought to write a long letter to Bessie,\" said Ellen hesitating. \" I am going to get a cutting of the white rose \u2014 I missed doing so in the autumn. Do come, the sun is out, and will gild the dark woods nicely.\" Mrs. Wentworth was a good persuader. Ellen hurried off a few lines to say that she was safe at Blair, and would write more fully very soon; after which she and her friend were speedily on their road to the Abbey. ENE OF VOL. I.
