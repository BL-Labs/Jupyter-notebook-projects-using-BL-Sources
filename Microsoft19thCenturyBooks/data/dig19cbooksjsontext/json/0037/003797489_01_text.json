UNDER THE TREES AT CHAGRES. It is very early morning at Chagres, and those who have any business to do (and no man has yet been known to go to Chagres for pleasure) are setting about it while they may. In one of the temples of commerce in the city of London, which I used to visit, was an inscrip tion in Latin with a merciful translation for the benefit of such clerks and office lads who had not made any portion of the ascent to Parnassus. The English was, \" Friend, de spatch thy business and depart.\" AVhatever temptations may exist in London for delay in business, there are none in Chagres. He who goes there takes pains to leave as soon as he can possibly do so. It is not a health resort. I do not think it will ever be one, not even when M. de Lesseps has finished his Canal, which is allowing time for development. If vol. i. 1"], [14, "2 TWO PARDONS. there be on the face of the globe any spot more unhealthy I have not heard of it, although it boasts itself more salubrious than Panama on the other side of the isthmus. \" Senor,\" a Chagres host will tell you, \" un happily our climate is not a favourable one for strangers, but it is, at least, much more healthy than Panama.\" \" Our town has not a good reputation,\" says a Panama man, \" but think how* very much worse off they are at Chagres. Now that is really an unhealthy place.\" AVhen a Panama native meets a Chagres citizen they agree in extolling their own towns and pitying the fate of those unfortunates who live at Colon. This place, they agree, is deadly. They are all bad enough, in plain truth. From the wet soil, on which every variety of tropical water-plant grows in profusion, come fearful malarious vapours which seize upon the stranger and strangle the life out of him. The country is a great hot swamp \u2014 a paradise for vegetation, a hell for men. One might be disposed to imagine that this would be the Utopia of an acclimatized undertaker, but it is not so. Your undertaker thrives upon cere mony and display, and there is httle of either"], [15, "UNDER THE TREES AT CHAGRES. 3 over a dead man in Chagres. In the time of which I am writing very little notice was taken of how a man died, none whatever of how he was buried. Shot, stab or local fever ; a trench in the sand, a hole in the swamp \u2014 wiiat mattered it ? On this particular morning when Chagres is just going about its work, at an unfrequented spot situated some distance from the huddled collection of houses and huts w*hich made up the Chagres of those days, three men are assembled under the shade of some cacaos and prickly pear trees. They are waiting for some one, it is clear, and to judge by their faces the business on hand is serious. Tw*o of them are leaning against the stem of a giant tree, whilst the third is seated a few paces from them upon a fallen log. All three are smoking contem platively, but are evidently doing so to while away the time only. There is a difference between the ages of these men ; of the two leaning against the tree one is young, the other of advanced middle-age ; the man on the log is the youngest of all, if we may judge by his face. He is pre-occupied and takes no heed of his companions, and it is not often that you will see on a face so young a look so hard and clour. 1\u20142"], [16, "4 TWO PARDONS. The eldest man speaks : \" I reckon it'll pan out just as I said. AVe may wait here till noon and be scorched up to tinder ; they've got appointments somewhere else. I know these Greasers.\" \" The Greasers know* that they haven't to fight, and he thinks he's coming out here to make the matter up. They'll come, captain.\" \" AVell, I don't see why the matter can't be made up. It's a pity to fight for a mistake ; can't it be managed ? \" \" Look at his face.\" \" Yes, I'll own it looks black. I haA'en't seen such a sudden change in anyone. I never took a greater fancy to a passenger, but I scarcely recognise him as the same man.\" \" He's not the same man.\" \" Is it an old quarrel ? \" \" It's an old quarrel.\" \" Well, it's a funny one. I don't want to pry into matters, but Frenchy swore last night that he'd never seen him before and hadn't said a word against him. A'ery well, says I, tell him so to-morrow morning.\" \" Yes, and he'll come out here to do so.\" \" And what will happen ? \" \"He'll stop here, I'm thinking.\""], [17, "UNDER THE TREES AT CHAGRES. 5 \" Well, well, I shall stand by my own kind, and it won't be the first time I've seen carving done, but blamed if it isn't a mystery to me ! However, I've said that I won't pry into it and I won't, though that's a good deal for a New Englander to say. You'll not refuse, after this, to give us credit for being rather less inquisitive than you usually Hello ! here are our men coming after all, I expect.\" The remark seems to be made, not so much on account of the speaker having observed any approaching forms, as because he sees the youngest man spring up from his seat and stand looking eagerly with shaded eyes towards the town. In a moment he turns to his com panions and nods, then places himself at their side, but without either speaking or changing the stern, hard expression of his face. In a few minutes the httle group is joined by three other men. Two of them need little description or notice save for the part which they are going to play. They are of the plump-faced, fat-handed variety of Mexican, and seem to think that by much swagger they may be mistaken for Spaniards, forgetting that calmness, dignity and grace are as natural to a Spanish gentleman as dark"], [18, "6 TWO PARDONS. hair and bright eyes. But the third man is of different mould. Tall, thin and strikingly handsome, he contrasts strongly with his com panions. He does not swagger, but his manner is bad. AVhereas the Alexicans have evidently put on airs of importance as though they have dressed for their parts, he has not taken the pains or has not the ability to conceal the roughness of his nature and the coarseness of bis mind. As his friends approach the waiting group they salute with all the pomposity of which they are capable, and the compliment is gravely returned even by the youngest member of it. But the third new-comer makes no sign. After whispering a few words to his compan ions he walks to a tree against which he leans, then rolling a piece of leaf-tobacco into a rough cigarette he lights it, and, turning his back to the party, looks towards the sea and affects to pay no attention to their proceedings. It is evident that no very peaceable motive has brought these six men out of Chagres this morning, and it is not difficult to discover who is to be the adversary of this apparently indif ferent principal. The youngest man of the Other party never for an instant takes his eyes from him. Every movement of hand or body"], [19, "UNDER THE TREES AT CHAGRES. is watched and, if possible, the hard look grow*s harder and the hatred in the face more and more deeply marked. This man is neither uninterested nor careless, if the other be. It is a singular sight this of watcher and w*atched, and, looking more attentively at it, one can see that while there is no disguise of the deadly purpose in the face of one man there is much that is assumed in the apparent unconcern of the other. The trembling of the hand, occa sionally caressing the dark beard, tells less of excitement than of trepidation, and there is a nervous change of the pose now* and then which betokens anxiety if not fear. You would say, could you see the pair, that each wishes the strife over, but for reasons as far asunder as the poles. The Mexicans approach the other two men, the elder of whom regards them with great disfavour. The faint wish which he just now expressed, that some means might be found of averting a fight, vanishes when he reflects that he will, in that case, have to treat with two Greasers. He internally lumps all three to gether, principal and seconds, hopes for a good fight and for his man to. win. The first compliments having been paid in"], [20, "TWO PARDONS. 8 Spanish, which it appears all speak, one of the Mexicans comes to the root of the matter, apparently Avith great vigour of speech and certainly with abundant gesticulation. \" Senores, our esteemed and most gallant friend, who comes with us this morning, bids us say to the friends of the cabaUero yonder that he knows not in what he has offended the proud spirit of their brave comrade. Behold, what is done ! Our gallant friend reclines, at the Hotel, against a post of the verandah. Sees not the approach of the caballero ; hinders him not from passing. Something has roused the anger of this last one : certainly not the act of our friend. Instantly, the verandah being full of people, your companion and com patriot hurls our gallant friend from his place, strikes him \u2014 ah, Madre de Dios! \u2014 on the breast, and \u2014 assuredly in a fever of rage \u2014 calls him ' Dog ! ' ' Hound ! ' ' Scoundrel ! ' Truly this is much. AVhat says the noble American captain ? \" The noble American captain, without any more signs of respect for the speaker than the strictest etiquette demands, replies : \" Truly it is much. Is it not enough for your gallant friend ? \""], [21, "UNDER THE TREES AT CHAGRES, 9 The word \" gallant \" is perhaps a trifle over-accented. \" Enough ? \" replies the Mexican. \" Car amba ! has our friend the heart of a do-?, think you, Senor Capitan ? \" \" We have not thought about him,\" breaks in the younger of the two seconds. \" AVe are wasting words and the sun is getting up. Do you wish the whole rabble of Chagres to come out here ? \" \" Senor,\" says the other Mexican, \" my compatriot has well stated that our gal lant friend has not injured your comrade there \" \" But he has stated what occurred last evening at the Hotel.\" \" A thousand pardons, senor, I know it well. But our gallant friend will not fight with your compatriot till he knows the cause of his attack.\" \" He is a Mexican, I suppose,\" says the cap tain irascibly. \" Once more, pardon ; he is not of that great and noble nation : yet he is brave, ah \u2014 brave as a hon.\" \" Or a Mexican ? \" \" Or a Mexican,\" says the representative of"], [22, "10 TAVO PARDONS. that lion-like race, with a grave bow and total obliviousness of the irony. \" Well,\" says the younger second, \" your srallant friend shall know the cause of the affray last night. Aly friend will tell him, himself.\" \" Many thanks, sefiores,\" say the Alexicans, and, with a profound bow', they return to their principal. The captain turns inquiringly to his asso ciate : \" He is to tell him, then ? \" \" Yes, and he will too. But when he speaks to him, look you sharply out for treachery. You are heeled, of course ? ' ' \" Navy, and know how to use her,\" says the captain. \" Good ! AVatch that fellow, and, if you see the shine of a barrel or a blade before our man is ready, drill a hole in him ! I'll answer for another, and these two Greasers don't count among men. Look out now ! \" And just as keenly as ever he watched the weather does the captain look out, his fingers clenched round the butt of his revolver. The Alexicans speak to their man, wdio shrugs his shoulders, throws aw*ay his cigar ette, and turning round towards his adversary"], [23, "UNDER THE TREES AT CHAGRES. 11 approaches him. Then, for the first time that morning, he meets that look, so stead fast, so full of hatred. His own face looks troubled and he tries in vain to force a laugh. It sounds too husky, when it comes, to be mistaken for mirth. He makes, how ever, an effort to appear at ease, and coming up to his adversary raises his hat. \" Senor, it is not my custom to submit to either blows or hard words, nor my habit to forego the punishing of those who inflict them ; but the darkness of the even ing and of the verandah may be some excuse. If you have that to urge in your defence you are excused and I say no more. If not, I demand, before meeting you, the reason for your outrage of last night.\" His adversary takes a step tow*ards him, and leaning forward so that none but he may catch what is said, whispers a few words in his ear. Whatever those words may be, the effect on him who hears them is as apparent as though they had been accompanied by a heavy blow. He fairly reels . under them. All vestiges of colour leave his face, and he stands for a moment panting for breath."], [24, "12 TWO PARDONS. Then a sudden despair seems to seize him \u2022 he gazes round as though to seek a means of escape. The younger man comes a step nearer as he shrinks back. There is no chance. In a second he draws a knife \u2014 the deadly Alexican machete \u2014 and turns to his foe. The hand of the American captain comes out of his pocket, swiftly but quietly, at the gleam of the steel, but he sees that his man also draws and he remains still. There is no need of any further preliminaries and one can guess what kind of a fight this will be. The Alexicans mutter to themselves and fidget uneasily ; the other seconds w*atch intently every movement, and the comba tants, w*ho are eyeing each other with looks as deadly in appearance as their weapons, wheel slowly round and wait the opening for the blow. It is not long in coming. With a spring as of some lithe beast, the elder man makes at his enemy. Instantly his right wrist is grasped by the left hand of the other and he sees the bright machete raised ; he makes a convulsive leap and in turn seizes a wrist, and then for a moment the two men look each other in the eyes, their faces only a few"], [25, "UNDER THE TREES AT CHAGRES. 13 inches apart. Only for a moment, however. A shadow* of horrible pain crosses the face of the elder man ; his wrist is wrenched round so violently that his agonised right hand relaxes its grip of the weapon ; a power ful wrench frees his enemy, and deep down into his breast plunges the machete, struck home with a blow so fierce, so well-timed and so true that there seems small need of another. But the w*eapon has yet more work ; it is withdrawn and once more descends with all the might of the young giant who wields it. Without a cry, without a groan \u2014 so well have those fell strokes done their work \u2014 an inert corpse falls to the ground and hes there laving the ground with a red stream. The four seconds run forward as he falls, but there is no help for one who has received blows such as those two. There is only a momentary investigation, no need of more. The Mexicans hastily cross themselves and look stupidly at the body. \" Quite dead,\" says the American captain. \" Senor,\" replies one of the Mexicans, \" undoubtedly, quite dead.\" \" And, as you saw, killed in a fair fight.\""], [26, "TWO PARDONS. 14 \" In most regular and honourable combat, seiior.\" \" So much for that. What of the\u2014 body.\" \" Senor, my illustrious friend will send some peons to inter it \u2014 is it not so, Don Leon ? \" \" It is so.\" \" Arery well then, gentlemen, w*e wish you a very good morning.\" \" Senores, we kiss your hands.\" And with a solemn salute the three friends leave them. The Mexicans do not remain long on the scene of the fatal duel. They are soon making for Chagres, not without much muttering and an occasional glance over the shoulder at the spot which they have left. The dead man is alone, lying with his face to the sky, just as they turned him over. That must have been a beautiful face once. That of a lovely babe\u2014 a noble-looking youth \u2014 perhaps a handsome lover with flashing eyes and homed hps. It is all over now. A scarlet tanager hops on to a shrub and looks at him with head on one side ; forms his ow*n opinion and flies away to his green and yellow mate. A carrion bird, circling"], [27, "UNDER THE TREES AT CHAGRES. 15 high, makes a note of him and determines that he will w*ait until there are not so many people about. Presently arrives a gang of labourers who approach the spot half stolid, half frightened, custom having bred in them certain superstition. AVith scant ceremony they raise the body, deposit it in a grave, easily dug in the yielding soil, and having covered it up, shoulder their spades and pace off with rather more of content in their faces to claim the promised wage and aguardiente. And this is the last scene of a wicked life. \" I said that I wouldn't seek to know anything about it,\" says the American cap tain, that evening, as they watch the receding coast, \" but I own that I'm more satisfied now that I have heard the statement of our friend here. You've no call to make yourself a bit uneasy about that coyote yonder. If ever an animal needed killing, he did. No, sir, his ghost won't haunt you ! \""], [28, "CHAPTER I. MR. ABEL BOMPAS SELLS A HOUSE, AND THE PURCHASER PUZZLES A TOWN. The town of Avonham in Marlshire was having a day-sleep. This was common enough to the place. AVhen the sun was fiercely beathig down on the red roofs and pohited gables, blistering the painted beams of the wood-franie houses, bleaching the w*ell-w*ashed pavement and the cobblestones of the old market-place, touching up the face of the market clock with a blaze of glaring gold, and making of the motion less w*eather-cock on the church steeple a burning arrow pointing to the hills from w*hich no breezes came \u2014 when it drove the masterless curs into doorways and under garden bushes, and set prowling cats a-nod ding in sight of their natural foes, when it fairly beat the inhabitants from the street, then Avonham used to pull down its blinds and indulge in a day-sleep. From the sixteen-"], [29, "MR. BOMPAS SELLS A HOUSE. 17 arched bridge that spanned its river, to the \" Bear Hotel,\" that seemed to close in the end of the town, and to keep a good look out down the road for any customer approaching, no one was astir in the street. Occasionally a white aproned, shirt-sleeved tradesman came to the door of his shop and gazed listlessly up and down, then, yawning, went back to his trade less counter, and nodded himself to sleep again ; the hum of the great mill-wheel at the bridge alone broke the silence, and the town seemed an appanage of the Sleeping Palace, waiting for the Prince to come. It was a pleasant place as it lay in the blaz ing June sun. Planted in a valley, with tree crowned hills at its western end, and watered by the pretty Avon, it stood in the midst of a smiling land of plenty. Around it, and bounded only by the wooded hills on one side and the great downs to its east, were meadows rich with waving grass, in which the feeding kine stood knee deep. The river breaking from the chalk was clear as crystal, and sparkled through the valley in generous, ever full stream winch turned countless wheels and rushed over httle weirs with pleasant plash \u2014 little weirs at the foot of which lurked speckled vol. i. 2"], [30, "TWO PARDONS. 18 trout and bold-biting perch ; at the town it flashed under a sixteen-arched bridge, built by some ancient Abbot of the Priory whose ruins stood just outside the town, and w'hose Hospi tium was still the front of the old \" Bear Hotel.\" From this bridge to the hotel ran the great broad street which formed the \u00a9 principal portion of the town ; on the right were the market-place and town hall, on the left the local bank and the residences of the magnates, the successful banker, the respected grey-headed solicitor, and the flourishing old fashioned country doctor. Then, at the top of the town, stood the old \" Bear,\" snuggest and cosiest of inns, with large yard still echo ing to the feet of post-horses and coach horses, and the spanking tits that drew the traps of the dashing commercial travellers, who still droA-e their journey through pleasant Aiarlshire, for there was no railway that had reached Avonham, and the nearest station was five miles away.

At the head of one of these streets stood the splendid Abbey Church of St. Hddegarde, with its spacious churchyard, crossed by a paved walk leading to the street in question, which it reached by steps. Beyond this churchyard were the Grammar School, and some houses of the better class, and, back ing on to the httle Alarden, w*ere the grounds of the Priory House. This was a large and imposing mansion, with finely wooded grounds concealed from public view by high walls. In the other side street were both private houses and shops, together with some offices and a brewery ; and lower down, and nearer the river, stood a large modern villa, in some grounds which ran to the Avon. One of the houses of this street, called from its direction South Street, was a combination of private house and office, and in one of the rooms of this house on this particular hot day sat a highly respectable family, consisting of father, mother, and three pretty daughters, engaged in discussing the penultimate course 2 2"], [32, "20 TWO PARDONS. of an English middle-class mid-day dinner.

He pur sued his way, however, in his usual imposing manner, and, having to deal with an ordinary and well-known client, was able to effect his business without any other mental shock.

There were two sections of Society in Avonham, and there was a Pariah Section which was not in Society at all. There was no neutral ground ; to one of the coteries everyone was bound to belong.

For the Mayor,"], [52, "40 TWO PARDONS. by virtue of his office, was of course the leader of all the pubhc doings in Avonham, and on him devolved the reception of any traveling greatnesses who might be visiting in the neigh- bourhood. He it was through whom was given that great moral support which Avonham has always extended to the Crown, and which the occupants of the throne haA'e esteemed so highly, eversince the days of Queen Mary who gave the town its charter. In the Town Hall was the bust of Sir Jabez Potts, who on being entrusted with an address to George III., on the occasion of the great defeat of the French by Lord Howe in 1794, had been kiighted by the King, to his great elation and to the pride and glory of Avonham, of which town he was a cloth-weaver. AVhat had happened before might happen again, and each succeeding Alayor of Avonham felt, as he buckled on the sword of office and donned the robes of State, that he too might kneel before his Sovereign o \u00a9 and after a few sweet and ennobling\" words \u00a9 might rise and return to his townsfolk and family a full-blown doughty knight. On the other hand, although at present the state of Alayoralty in Avonham was satisfac tory so far as the position of the occupier of"], [53, "GUESTS AT THE PRIORY HOUSE. 41 the civic throne was concerned, he being a sohcitor and having succeeded Mr. Bompas, who w*as presentable in \" Society,\" yet there were times when the gentility had been ter ribly puzzled as to how to receive a Alayor who was a butcher, w*ho stood at his door with his blue apron on, left the slaughter-house for the Tow*n Council, and exchanged the Chop ping-block for the Chair. And then again, although the Alayor might be tolerated in his official robes and with the handsome chain of office round his neck, yet, alas ! there was one appalling fact to consider, which was that there was neither chain nor scarlet robe of office wherewith to deck the Mayoress. So it came to pass that Society which, as we all know, has its immense tasks forced upon, and not sought by it, had to suffer greatly in re conciling wrhat was due to itself with what was due to the town. Such sacrifices were, how ever, made with that patience and courage which has generally characterised all martyr doms ; and the town and its gentility managed to work together amicably and for the interests of both. There was a second section of Society, re spectable in its way, larger than the Gentility"], [54, "42 TWO PARDONS. section, and in reality the mainstay of Avon ham ; front this class came more of the Aiayors than from the \" upper-crust,\" as the youth of the second section termed it. It had no re gular leader, the ladies being less amenable to the rule of one person than the follow*ers of Airs. Stanhope. It had one link and one link only that bound it socially with the first class, and that was the Church and its affairs. But it was as exclusive towards its inferiors as if it had been the highest society in the land ; stofid respectabibty was its great characteristic ; its female members inhausted much tea, its males had their club at which they consumed much tobacco, settled the affairs of the country-side with solemnity, and observed towards the Crown, the Church, and the Constitution, that reverence and loyalty for wdiich the httle town had long been noted, but into which reverence a most curious anomaly crept, which was that, though devotedly Protestant and unfeignedly Evangelical, it yet respected and admired, just as most other Protestant communities detested and abhorred, the memory of pastor-roasting Alary, from w*hom the place held, as we said before, the charter which made it a town. AVe mention the Pariah section as cautiously"], [55, "GUESTS AT THE PRIORY HOUSE. 43 as possible and with this saving clause for it, that it consisted in a great measure of youths, who, not having yet acquired any reverence for the respectabilities, had not become at tached to either party, but openly held aloof from both. These were generally reconciled to one of the sections by the face and form of some female member, whose influence induced the youth, first to neglect his old companions and pursuits, next to hover about the outskirts of the section which held his charmer, and finally, having attained the object of his affec tions in the parish church, to settle down re spectably and quietly in the station of Avon ham hfe to which the young lady called him. There were sometimes instances of an inverse working of this rule, when a youthful member of one of the great parties, having been rejected by a lady, left his party in desperation and joined the ranks of the Pariahs, but such in stances were rare, and the Pariahs, who were not at all bad Pariahs, but some of the liveliest youths of the place, were not fond of encourag ing these deserters, but more often insisted, kindly and firmly, in being suffered to go their own way alone. Aiany of these wild blades were in the habit of making excursions to"], [56, "44 TWO PARDONS.

And to-day the notabilities of Avonham w*ere as sembled there to welcome no smaller a lumi- nary than the Right Rev*, the Bishop of the Diocese. Seated in the most comfortable of armchairs under the shadiest of trees, the worthy father was chatting smoothly and mellifluously with lis fair hostess.

Standing beside his lordship and also in conversation with his hostess was Sir Head ingly Cann, Bart., Alember of Parliament for Avonham, which he represented entirely to the satisfaction of his constituents, who had not troubled themselves or him with a contested election for eighteen years : a tall fresh coloured good-looking Enghsh gentleman with all the precise and perhaps pedantic courtesy of the good old school. At a little distance from this group, an old beau, with a most wonderful assumption of youth, was chatting the smallest of small talk with the three pretty daughters of Mr. Bompas and with their mamma, whilst, some paces from them, Mr. Bompas himself and Mr. Boldham, the banker, were discussing some weighty point of finance, which hfted them awhile from the surrounding gaiety, and had involved them in a stream of figures so inexplicably dense that it made one hot to listen, for which reason, probably, they w*ere entirely alone."], [58, "46 TWO PARDONS. Regarding the antique beau, whose name was Trumphy, and who was the delight of all the maiden ladies of Avonham, was a young fellow of about twenty-six, who was leaning against the pillar of a verandah and casting glances of excessive scorn from a pair of very black eyes upon the unconscious little gentle man, wrho was smirking and bowing and keep - ing up a string of extravagant compiments, and w*ho was firmly persuaded of his ability to hold entranced all the pretty maidens at the party, but who was at present especially devoting himself to the undoubted belle of them all, Adelaide Bompas, w*hom we have already described as a very pretty, merry Engish lassie. There seemed to be no reason why Alfred Shelman should not have joined that or any other group that afternoon, but he chose rather to stand by the verandah and scowl at little Air. Trumphy in a belicose and unpleasant manner. For he had not a pleasing expression, this black-haired, black whiskered, black - eyed, dark - complexioned young man, and httle white patches came and w*ent round his thin lips and nostrils in a manner not good to look upon. He was aroused from his meditation by a voice \u2014 a"], [59, "GUESTS AT THE PRIORY HOUSE. 47 lazy, drawding voice which seemed to express half sloth, half contempt, and appeared to have a pleasing effect on the person who possessed it, and a most irritating one upon him who heard. \" Going to sleep, Shelman, or planning an escape from this outdoor oven, eh ? \" \" What do you mean ? \" said Shelman with a start, \" planning what ? going where ? \" \"Oh, I see,\" drawled the other, \"it's the Bompas girls \u2014 Gad, I haven't seen 'em for an age.

He was not so morose as Shelman, but had an indolent, sleepy sort of face, which, in its pink - and - whiteness, its regularity and its want of expression, looked hke the face of a doll. He was curled and ringed and scented, and on the best terms with himself, and was as conceited a piece of vanity as any in Marl shire.

He had had his cheery little old-world gossip, had paid his well-worn compliments and earned his meed of praise, having really amused his good natured hearers, and lo ! his triumph was to depart at the first words of the good-looking boy who w*as sauntering towards them. But he had reckoned without his host ; the young ladies certainly bowed, but immediately cast little meaning glances at one another ; buxom Airs. Bompas was the only one who took the outstretched hand, but a cloud passed over her merry face as she did so, and Air.

And rumour spoke of others also. Rumours said that AAralter RiA*ers had been also sent away by one of the trio, to which statement was sometimes added the fact that the young gentleman had been astounded by getting that curious social entomological specimen a \" flea in his ear \" from the lady whom he supposed he was honouring by those attentions so welcome to many, but so unre quited where he most wished them faA*ourably receiA*ed.

Dray's rostrum, a kind of wheeled reading desk which was draw*n by a pony from point to point. The bidding started briskly, and very soon reached a hundred guineas, for the Duke's whip made a sudden and bold leap when sixty was reached and seemed to fancy that the horse was his. Mr. Shelman, however, and a httle wiry local steeplechase jockey, still opposed, and at a hundred and thirty he turned aside with a sigh \u2014 he had really exceeded his hmit, but he said to his neighbour, \" I know* the Duke 'ud a liked him, and it's a shame to lose him, on'y I got my orders A*ery particular about price this early time.\" The httle jockey was still manfully bidding against Mr. Shelman, to the latter's visible annoyance, so he crossed the ring and went to him. vol. i. 0"], [94, "82 TAVO PARDONS. \" Why the devil can't you let me have the horse, Hart ?

He had made his way to Mrs. Bompas, and w*as greeting the ladies in her circle, when the young farmer, who had A*olunteered to bring back the news of the sale, returned. He saw Shelman in the room and so told his tale in a low tone of voice, but the news evoked an ex clamation of surprise from two or three of the group. Shelman turned and adA'anced towards them, saluted the ladies, and shook hands with some of the young men, amongst them the young farmer, the son of one of his tenants. \" I thought you meant having that chestnut just now, sir,\" said the latter. \" Ah,\" said Shelman, carelessly, \" you were 6\u20142"], [96, "84 TWO PARDONS. there, Rodwell, of course, I saw you \u2014 yes \u2014 but he went too high.

Sir Headingly Cann and his nephew sat at breakfast one summer morning, about a week after the fair.

Here he sat then, toying with some straw berries, and opposite him his nephew, whom this sort of luxurious ease just suited.

He fell to thinking OA*er his past career, and there was nothing in it that he could recall (with the exception of his mother's death) but w*as gay, cheerful, pain less, and free from all care, and now came this crowning piece of good fortune.

Christopher Raraty, the post master of the town, learned in horse-flesh and eloquent of the old coaching days when he himself drove the Defiance a hundred and sixty miles in eighteen hours, stoppages included ; and then Mr. Barnabas Chickleholt, who was rough of exterior and affected \u2014 only affected, mind you \u2014 a grumpiness of manner which caused strangers to look upon him as haAing been improperly named by his sponsors, and as"], [118, "106 TAVO PARDONS. being anything but a son of consolation. Then sturdy John Rann, the market clerk, who was the centre of all the political business of the town. Next to him was the enormous form of ex-AIayor Killett, most prosperous of sine curists, the only butcher hi AA*onham, as his father and grandfather had been before him, a giant with the carcass and strength of a raging Bull, and the manners of a Southdown Lamb. As a contrast in size, but a counterpart in manners, Air. Reuben Alatley came next to him : the organist of the parish church and teacher of music and drawing, a real genius blushing unseen in this little Aiarlshire town for sheer want of that impudence and dash that had taken men with half his ability into the front rank of native musical talent. Opposite his burly son, to whom he had transferred his business some years ago, was old \" Alaster\" Killett, the Nestor of the country-side iioav that Air. Rax was gone, a hale, weather-bitten, fresh-coloured man of oA*er fourscore years, who, sixty years before, had been the foremost man at backsw*ord and elbow and collar wrestling for twenty miles around.

And beside him was Air. Sennett \u2014 Lawyer Sennett he was generally called \u2014 who made all the AA'onham wills and injured his business but increased his circle of friends by patching up half the country side quarrels, and on whose shoulders this year rested the awful responsibility of being mayor. On Mr. Arto's left was Mr. Daniel Follwell, the proprietor of the woollen factory of the towm, w'ho turned out a small quantity of cloth each year, but that of so rare a quality and so precious a value that it was whispered that the one great London tailor to whom it was all sold reserved it entirely for the backs of Dukes and Earls, and that an untitled digni tary might pray for a coat of it in vain. Mr. Follw*ell was a short man, who, to judge by his dress, neither w*ore his own cloth nor employed the' great London tailor aforesaid, and whose rebellious stubbly head of hair gave him the uninviting appearance of an overgrown cloth teazle'.

Then came two brothers, the inseparables of A\\*onham, AVolstenholme Pye and Hoppenner Pye, fellmongers, two httle wizened-faced old men, w*ho silently absorbed A*ast quantities of liquor Avith no other effect than that produced by the air-pump upon a wrinkled apple \u2014 the good spirits seemed to smooth out the lines on their faces by degrees, until at the close of the sitting they looked quite sleek-faced for a time. Next to Hoppenner was Mr. Timothy Rapsey, an amiable Paul Pry, always burning for information and utterly unable to resist the temptation of diving into his neighbours' af fairs ; a good-humoured httle fellow, howeA*er, and Avithout the least grain of mischief in him.

Rax dropped, and coirversation became general and was carried on in louder and more cheerful tones. There was not a wide range of subjects in Avonham, but to wear those few threadbare was the dehght of the Club. These friends had met on hundreds of nights and had talked the same small talk ; the same subjects had lasted their fathers' time and their own too, and it was only very rarely that any matter of special import cropped up ; but to-night the Club, which had already gone vol.

Air. Rann was eA'idently elated by it in no ordinary degree ; he laid down his pipe, leaned a little forward with his hands on his knees and triumphantly surveyed the astonished room. \" I opine,\" said Air.

For eighteen years Sir Headingly Cann had been the member for Avonham, in the Con servatiA*e interest, and his position had never been assailed. He had been a steady A*oter for his own side, a constant and regular attendant at St. Stephen's ; he never gave the AVhips the least anxiety, and seldom troubled the House with a speech, certainly never bored them with a long one ; Avhen he did lift up his voice it was on some agricultural topic, and he was admitted to be an authority on that point ; he had never sought office, had no poor rela tions to be provided for by the country, and was altogether a model representative of high character, and A*ery much liked by members"], [130, "118 TAVO PARDONS. on both sides of the House. In Avonham he was generous to the poor, watchful OA*er the interests of the town, hospitable and affable, and a general favourite in the neighbourhood ; so it had come to pass that, for many years, party politics had been a dead-letter in Avon ham. Contented Avith a member who was a moderate and liberal-minded man, people were unAvilling to run the risk of that upheaA*al of society which takes place in a small town at election times, and, when they read of scenes of riot, of military interference, and damaged property, they congratulated themselves upon their immunity from such scenes, and were entirely satisfied with the old state of things . But all this time there had been slowiy and almost imperceptibly growing up in AA*onliam that unreasoning dislike to long continued \u00a9 \u00a9 customs so characteristic of younger genera tions ; four miles from Avonham AA'as the borough of Dunstalne, winch returned a very advanced Liberal, AA'ith the same consistency that Avonham showed towards its mild Tory ; and the advanced Liberal member for Dun stalne was one of the great lights of Parliament, a brilliant speaker, an able statesman, who had been tAAice a member of the Cabinet ; s > that"], [131, "AVONHAM IS THOROUGHLY EXCITED. 119 Dunstalne was apt to be loud in praise of the man it had chosen, and the praise reached four miles, and excited interest in Avonham, so much so that when the great man came dow*n to address his constituents, he would have fifty or sixty of the younger politicians of Avonham among his audience, and this fact was not un observed by the leaders, the great wire-pullers ( \u00bbf the party, so that a kind of thumb-nail note Avas made of Avonham at the Reform Club, and it was hinted at as a place not unw-orthy the honour of an assault.

Rann, who, perfectly satisfied of his ow*n importance in the eyes of his Club fellows, went home by himself, chuckling The next morning, Sir Headingly Cann and his nephew AA'ere seen by the indefatigable Timothy Rapsey driving swiftly through Avonham tow*ards the railway station, fiA*e miles from the town ; this eA*ent was duly reported by him to those of his friends w*hom he met during the day, and was at the present stage of affairs much commented on. The next morning's papers contained an account of the Alinisterial defeat in the House \u2014 and following hard upon this came the dissolution. Then, for the first time for eighteen years, was any political excitement visible in AA*onham. In every public-house, at every tea-table, on the"], [134, "122 TWO PARDONS. j market, in the street, in shops and offices, and everywhere that men do congregate, nothing was talked of for a week but the election. For a day or two no sign was made, and the old Conservatives of Avonham were just lul ling themselves to sleep again when a most surprising eA*ent happened. Sir Headingly had issued small and well printed handbills, which had been posted to every A*oter on the register, announcing briefly the fact of the dissolution and his intention of offering himself again for election, but had made no other public movement. One Tues day night the little town went serenely to sleep as usual, and when it was buried in re pose certain mysterious figures emerged from the \" AAroolpack Inn,\" and, after a short con sultation at the door, separated and dispersed in various directions.

There was one point concerning Galbraith upon which all Avonham was agreed. He Avas a thorough iorseman. In a county of hunting men he was already distmguished for the grace of his seat, for the fineness of his hands, and for the dashing style of his ridhig. It was not exactly the English hunting- seat Avhich he adopted \u2014 there was a something in it, men said, which told that the horseman had been used to wilder scenes than an orthodox fox hunt ; but it was certain that between horse and man there was such a thorough under standing that the two together might have formed a Centaur.

One or two had been in the house during Galbraith's stay there, pre vious to the purchase of the \" Coombes,\" and these, venturing on a \" Good morning, sir,\" were so affably answered, that they took heart and entered gladly into conversation with him, to their great delight. Among these faA*oured indiA*iduals was Mr. Timothy Rapsey, who was quite unable to conceal his joy at having at last got into com*ersation with the stranger who had baffled his most determined efforts, and about whom he had been able to learn next to nothing during his residence in Avon- \u00a9 \u00a9 ham. He knew not where to begin to tackle him ; he wanted to know so much that he ran some great chance of letting every opportunity slip in his anxiety to put the question that should tell him most ; the election was, of course, the safest subject as being the most natural at the present time, and so on that he started ; but, alas ! he was foiled ; Mr. Gal braith had no interest in it, did not possess a vote, and said so rather curtly ; he seemed to understand Mr. Rapsey pretty well, as that gentleman was quite shrewd enough to perceive. But, if Mr. Galbraith had no interest in the election, others had, and to introduce the 9\u20142"], [144, "132 TWO PARDONS. subject was like starting a fire in a straw yard. Worthy Mr. Pinniffer, whose neat wines and choice spirits were innocent of politics, w*as the only other man in the room disinclined to enter upon the topic, everyone else seeming to fancy that the matter could be just as well settled then and there by his own individual vocal exertions as at the hustings. Galbraith lit a cigar and listened, making no remark. The chief interest of the election seemed to be that it was less of a political than a personal contest, and that, how*ever ardent a partisan of one candidate a man might be, he was al ways willing and indeed eager to admit the virtues of his opponent ; it soon appeared that the Church party w*ould follow Sir Headingly Cann and the Dissenters Air. Boldham ; that the \" gentle-folk \" w*ere supposed to be about equally divided, and lastly, that Sir Headingly seemed to have the better chance of winning, but that Mr. Boldham would be sure to run him pretty close and make a hard fight of it. \" Tell you what though,\" said Air.

Meanwhile the innocent cause of all this agitation was quietly riding along the Dun stalne Road and up the rather steep Berry Hill which intervened between that town and Avonham ; he cantered easily along, skirting Dunstalne without entering it and emerged on \u00a9 \u00a9 the high road which exactly divides the rich table-land of the Aiarlshire Downs ; there is scarcely another galloping ground in the king dom like this, as the four or fiA-e trainers who daily use it know full well. Alore than one Derby winner has set the Marlshire A'illage bells a-ringing ; many of the equine heroes of Newmarket and Yorkshire have had to suc cumb to Aiarlshire trained racers, and horses who are not perfectly sound give their trainers less anxiety on these A*elvety downs than at any other horsey centre of England. Leaving the road^ Galbraith pulled his horse together and sent him at a smart pace for about a mile,"], [153, "THE \"RECLUSE\" COMES OUT. 141 then walked him quietly at the side of the road, just on the turf, riding past barrow's where lay the bones of unknown heroes, un sung dead, and boulders and stones whose use and meaning ha\\*e baffled sages of all times and of which nothing certain is knoAvn even now. He had proceeded in this way for some two miles, when he saw in front of him two horses, on one of which sat a lady, who was watching with great interest the action of a groom who was examining the foot of the other. As he approached nearer he perceived that the lady was Miss Adelaide Bompas, and that the old coachman and groom of the family was lamenting OArer his horse, which was dead lame. \" 'Tes no good, Miss Addie,\" said the old fellow, rising from his inspection, \" you'll hev to goo alone, uther back or forrard ; old Brownie can't goo no further.

Galbraith's meditation. \" I'm rather glad we came across each other hke this.

He returned the glance, and there was something so comical in the situation that Adelaide rippled out a merry httle trill of laughter, Galbraith followed with a hearty peal, and then Aliss Bompas slightly blushed and struck Brunetta smartly with her dainty whip. \" Here we are,\" she said, after a short period of silence. \" That is Beytesbury House on the green there.\" vol.

Galbraith ; pray don't trouble.\" They drew up in front of a fine old-fashioned house on the green. Galbraith leaped quickly from his horse and assisted Miss Bompas to dismount. A peal at the gate brought out a neatly-dressed handmaid, who summoned a man to take the horses. \" I will wait for you here, Aliss Bompas,\" said Galbraith, and Adelaide thanking him, went into the house. Mr. Millard was an old friend of Air. Bom pas, and Adelaide was his god -daughter and had been a great favourite of his for many years. Now it is one of the privileges of old friends of a family to be very facetious with the daughters of the said family respecting their admirers, and Air. Alillard, who had seen from his window that Adelaide was accom panied by a gentleman, was not slow* in avail ing himself of his rights. He listened gravely"], [159, "THE \"RECLUSE\" COMES OUT. 147 to Adelaide's account of Brownie's lameness, and of the meeting on the road, and then laughing, said : \"Well, my dear, it's an ill wind that blows nobody good, and if poor Brownie got lame, you see, you got rid of an old man and met with a young one, so it's not so bad after all. Ha, ha, ha ! \" \" Well, I couldn't help that, could I ? said Adelaide. \" Why should you, my dear ? \" said the merry old fellow. \" A good-looking young gentleman's better company any day than an old groom, isn't he, Martha ? \" \" Lor', Addie, my dear,\" said Airs.

After thanking Mr. and Mrs. Millard for their hospitality and commenting on the weather, he drew the conversation to the surrounding country and its agricultural resources. He talked easily and fluently, and was an excellent listener. Air.

He discoursed with Mrs. Alillard of the \\irtues of Annatto in cheese, and told her husband of a dressing for sheep. His host and hostess were charmed with him, and Adelaide sat in wonder at hear ing the man, whom she and her laughing sisters had dubbed the \"recluse,\" taking the chief part of the talking on his own shoulders, and bearing the burden so easily and so well."], [161, "THE \"RECLUSE\" COMES OUT. 149 When she rose to go, Mr. Millard was most pressing in his invitation to Mr. Galbraith to come again. \" Now mind,\" he said, shaking him cordially by the hand, \" I shall look for you very soon.

They rode along briskly enough, their horses refreshed by the rest, and rapidly approached Dunstalne. Now what was Miss Adelaide to do ? She was almost as well known in Dunstalne as in Avonham, yet she must call and see that Brownie was all right. It really was very embarrassing haAing this escort with her. And yet she liked it too. At Dunstalne Air.

Air. Galbraith rode back to Miss Adelaide with this news and they proceeded on their way to Avonham. It was four o'clock in the afternoon when they reached that town, and almost the first person Aliss Adelaide saw in the street was Shelman. He started as though a blow had been given to him as he saw who her companion was ; she rode rapidly past, giAing her mare the spur lightly, and swiftly crossing the market place ; as they reached her father's house Air.

Aiore luggage, more excitement. Next, Mr. Galbraith's black servant entered the hotel, and, bestowing a grin upon Mr. Pinniffer, passed upstairs. The company could hear the sound of laughing, talking and greeting as the door opened. Then a waiter came down in a mighty hurry, recei\\*ed a bottle of bitters from Miss Pinniffer, and disappeared again. And now haA'ing seen all they were likely to see, until the dinner was over, having taken in the stupendous fact that there were five gentlemen, entire strangers to the town, dining with a resident scarcely better known than they, the company fell to smoking stolidly. Upstairs the dinner proceeded merrily ; the two waiters and Air. Pinniffer, who superin tended them, attended assiduously to the"], [170, "158 TWO PARDONS. gentlemen, who seemed to have had their ap- petites thoroughly sharpened by the Aiarlshire air. Mr. Pinniffer's heart swelled with pride as he listened to the encomiums passed upon the cookery and the whies. The conversation was disappointing in the extreme to the worthy waiters, who had, hke the Bath coachman, been interviewed by Air. Rapsey, before dinner ; two of the gentlemen, the party from Bath, in fact, had been making a tour of the Continent, and imparted freely their impressions and ex- periences. Air. Galbraith w*as uniformly ad- dressed as \" Harry,\" but as most people in AA*onham knew that he had signed the feAv written notes and cheques which from time to time he had sent his tradesmen \" H. Gal- braith,\" that did not seem A*ery A*aluable information to give to any enquirer. And once, in the middle of the dinner, when Gal- braith had drunk most cordially to his friends (as far as they could make out), the language in which his short speech was made was en tirely unknown to the attendants, as was also that in which his guests had replied ; and the rest of the talk whilst dinner lasted had been of things for the most part beyond their ken. Hints they got that the party had been long"], [171, "FRIENDS FROM FAR AVEST. 159 known to one another and that they had passed through adventures, the recollection of which caused sometimes laughter and sometimes sor rowful murmurs of regret ; but as the dinner drew to a close, and the wine was freely circulating, the conversation was carried on almost entirely in this \" forrin' tongue,\" which the party all spoke, and which Air. Pin niffer was ready to aA*ow was not French, nor anything like it. At last, the dinner was at an end, the cloth was removed, and the wine having been set, the waiters and Mr. Pinniffer, with many bows, left the room. Cigars were lit and the decanters were briskly passed. Galbraith waited till all were primed and smoking, and then turning to his serA*ant, who had entered the room, said : \" Edward, you'll take a few cigars, and a bottle of wine, and sit in the next room, so that you can see if anyone comes to the door. If anyone does, send him downstairs again if I want you I will ring the hand-bell you brought.\" \" Very well, sah,\" said the negro, and taking his cigars and wine he withdrew. \" Now, boys,\" said Galbraith, turning to his"], [172, "160 TWO PARDONS. guests, \" bumpers ! here's to the Old Squire Gulch boys, and here's to the old Squire ! \" (Mr. Reuben Matley downstairs took his pipe from his mouth and mildly observed that the gentlemen upstairs seemed to be enjoying themselA'es. \" Drinking the Queen's health,\" Mr. Foil well supposed.) \" AVell, boys,\" said the elderly gentleman, who had first driven up with Galbraith ; \" they were good days while they lasted, and we didn't do badly out of them, eh ? \" \" No, Squire, thanks to you and your iron rule.\" \" How many times I've thought OA*er the dear old place,\" said the young naA*al officer ; \" and the Squire and you, Harry, and old Polecat who ran the saloon, and how he got shot that time you fellows went over to Cin nabar Mountain, and came back so deadbeat \u2014 such a trio of scarecrow's.\" \" Served us right,\" said another ; \" we haven't forgotten how you took us back, and never shook us, but chummed us in again as if nothing had happened ; you haven't for gotten that, Harry, have you ? \""], [173, "FRIENDS FROM FAR WEST. 161 \" No, Fred, and never shall, old fellow ; here's to the stay-at-homes of Old Squire Gulch ! \" (\" They're going through the list of toasts proper,\" said Mr. Pinniffer, downstairs, \" that's the Army and Navy, I s'pose.\" \" Most likely,\" said the customers.) \" How queer though,\" said Fred, \" that we should all be in Europe together, and that you knew it, Harry.\" \" Precious lucky, I fancy ; the sight of six old Gulchers, and the Squire one of them, is a sight for sore eyes, I think.

There was a dead silence, a sympathetic silence, one such as falls on a circle of friends wrho know* that the next words which break it will be fraught with unpleasant meaning, leading to the opening of some hidden wound, the marring of some dream of joy ; then AValter Bryceson said : \" Ah !

Reginald and I are sons of the same mother, but Reginald's father died when he was quite a child, and mother married again. Aly father was never particularly fond of either of us, that I could see ; but he was anything but kind to Reginald. That was the reason of his going away from home ; an uncle took care of him, and, when he died, left him a A*ery nice income, about \u00a3400 a-year. Of course Reginald was under age, and so he came home for a bit, and my father managed his money. Well, they couldn't agree, and one day, after a terrible row, Regi nald declared he would stay at home no longer ; he was then eighteen years old, and I was twelve. Mother was hi delicate health, or I believe Reginald would have gone before. At any rate, go he did, and of course America"], [179, "FRIENDS FROM FAR WEST. 167 was his destination. When he had been there three years, and I was only fifteen, mother died, and I was left at home with father. I beheve he was fond of me in his w*ay, but he was a reserved kind of man, and whatever he might ha\\*e felt he kept pretty much to him self. Aly youthful days at home were not my happiest ones, and I was always glad enough to get back to fagging at Rugby, I can tell you. Reginald was twenty-one when he made his appearance at home to claim the money his uncle had left him, and w*as a fine, manly looking fellow. Father and he were no more affable to one another than usual, and although the money was scrupulously accounted for, and father had really managed affairs in the best possible way, yet there was a row OA*er the settlement, as indeed there w*as over almost all that passed between those two. It was then that Reginald conceiA*ed the idea of taking me over to America with him. I had been grumbling to him one day about some fancied wrongs in home-life, and eagerly accepted his offer. We left home on a visit to an aunt, my mother's sister. AVe did not go there, but went to Liverpool, and before father knew that we had not paid our visit we were three parts"], [180, "168 TAVO PARDONS. of the way across. AVell, when we got there, Reginald decided to put me to school, and I went first to a tutor's, and then, as you know, AValter, to Yale, where we were class-mates.\" \" We were, for three years,\" said Bryceson. \" It was during that time that Reginald Avent AVest. It was there he met this woman, who was singing at a theatre in St. Louis. He w*as fascinated AA'ith her, and married her : she was, as some of you know*, a remarkably handsome woman.\" \"She was indeed,\" said the Squire, \"and poor Reginald AA'as very fond of her, and she of him at first, apparently.\" \" AVell, you know how she treated him : how she made him jealous with other men, how she refused to come East, how her tantrums drove him nearly wild, and how, one time w*hen he had run East to see me one A*acation, she left him for eAer, and drove him to madness and death.\" The speaker's voice trembled, and he paused and drank some wine before resuming : \" I shall never forget how Reginald took the news, how* he rushed away from me\u2014 it was the last time I eA*er saw him \u2014 quite fran tic.

After Reginald AVilding had gone East to see you, this woman, as you say, left with a fellow from New York. Reginald was of course told of it by one of us. AVe'd no idea of anything Avrong until the mischief was all done. He came back quite like a madman, refused all offers of help, but traced the runaway couple' to Memphis and Baton Rouge. There, by all accounts, he met them ; and there, as we learned afterwards, Avas shot by the fellow who had robbed him of his wife, and died in a few days, delirious and unknown.\" \" That's right, Fred,\" said Tom Reynolds, \" we both tried all w*e knew to get hold of the blackguard and have a shot at him, but he got away to New Orleans, and from there to HaA'anna, as far as we could make out, and we never set eyes on either of them \u2014 bad luck to them.\" \" But, Harry,\" said Ralph Derring, \" why is it, old fellow*, that you bring this up again ? Do you remember that when you came West"], [182, "170 TAVO PARDONS. to St. Louis, where we all were, and whence we had intended starting for Colorado with poor Reginald before this affair happened, it was agreed after we had, as Tom says, adopted you, that we shouldn't let you brood over these matters ? \" \" I'll answer that,\" said the Squire, break ing in before Galbraith had time to reply. \" The reason is one that Harry can hardly giA*e you.

CANVASSING. \" Hoav many 'lections haA*e you seen in Avon ham in your time, father ? \" said ex- Alayor Killett, grazier and butcher, taking his clay pipe from his mouth and lifting a healthy looking brown jug thereto.

There was no more affectionate and dutiful child hi the country side than the braw*ny Hercules w*ho had succeeded him : and no one who paid him more deference. The old man was the oracle of the neighbourhood, and the son sat at his feet as at those of another Gama liel. It was acknowledged that no one could compete with old Alas'r Killett in local lore, and the evening of his life was spent in telhng the younger generations around him what had passed and happened in Aiarlshire in its morn-"], [185, "CANA*ASS1NG. 173 ing. He now in turn remo\\*ed his pipe, and, taking a draught from his own especial brown jug, conveniently placed at his elbow and filled with his son's best home-brewed, proceeded to answer his question. Now when Mas'r Killett or any other Marl shire oracle spoke of the days of yore in reply to any query put, a certain manual exercise was gone through with time-honoured solem nity. First, the capacious w*aistcoat w*as slowiy pulled down until its wrinkles had well-nigh disappeared, then the disengaged hand {i.e., the hand which held neither pipe nor tankard) was rubbed slowly and softly up and down the side of the leg a few times ; after that the body was inclined forwards, and the pipe stem pointed to the interlocutor (if there were no pipe present the forefinger performed its office) , and lastly, the rubbing hand stopped and rested on the point of the knee, emphasising the answer by a series of taps or slaps, according to whether the subject were being calmly or excitedly discussed\u2014 and the first word of the reply was \" whoy ! \" This w*as the cabahstic forerunner of the speech of the average Marl shire oracle. There were great advantages in this. In"], [186, "174 TWO PARDONS. the first place, you got your reply diplomati cally, and therefore trustworthily. Having surrounded the desired information with all the ancient ceremony and pomp due to its merit, no Aiarlshire sage would think for a moment of advancing anything but the best at his command. Then, again, it was not a hasty answer, but one which was being pain fully and carefully revolved in the mind whilst the hands w*ere gracefully preparing the way for it. Lastly, it precluded heat and anger, and showed that your question was re spected as it was expected the reply would be. All the appropriate man\u0153uvres having been performed by old Alas'r Killett, and the pre liminary \" whoy \" haA*ing been produced, he answered his questioning son. \" Not more than about a five, my son ; Sir Headingly (Mr. H. Cann he were when he first come here), he\\*e sat here for eighteen year, and afore him w*as Mr. Aleares, him as is Sir John now, a notable old man he must be, and lives somewheres abroad. Thirty-four year he sat for AA*onham. There was Air. Alathews sat with him till the Great Bill of '32.

I mind Mr. Mathews' funeral as if 'twas only yesterday. Why, Sir John was member then, and it was before Sir Headingly sat here at all.\" \" To be sure, my son, to be sure it was.

One arm he had only, and great doings there was at his 'lection. I was but a lad, but I remem ber it well.

And that's all the 'lection domgs that's been in Avonham this eight-and-sixty years, as many men could testify if so be as they were alive to do so.\" \" 'Tis surely seldom a towm does have so few,\" said the son, reflectively. \" Yes,\" said the old man, \" and 'twill put many good men into a quandary now* how to A'ote to save giving offence.\" \" 'Twill that, father. I wish the 'lection w*ere further ; we've been li\\ing quiet and neighbourly for years, and had nothin' to come in betw*een friends 'cept maybe a bit o' market-day trading that seemed to pinch one side now and again.

There was going to be words over it I could see, only I hurried cutting Rann's steak and draAved Air. Arto off on to a saddle of mutton and saved trouble so.\" And the good-hearted giant shook his head sadly as he thought of the division in the town. He was not the only old inhabitant who regretted the existing state of things ; the younger men of the town dehghted in the contest, and went heart and soul into the fray for their respective sides, but the seniors shook their heads. Among them Sir Headingly Cann had a perceptible majority, although some hke Doctor Aiompesson were in favour of a younger and more energetic man. There was no burning question of the day imported into the election at Avonham as was the case with larger constituencies. Air. Boldham made the Railway Bill his trump card, and twitted his vol. I. 12"], [190, "178 TWO PARDONS. rival with having so long delayed bringing it forward. Sir Headingly again promised the Bill and rested his claim on his long services, on his Church and State proclivities, and on his personal influence in the town. To say truth, the old man had a task before him winch was not only uncongenial but repugnant to him. For eighteen years his annual address had been for him only a small part of a connection which long use had made A*ery pleasant. To reply for the House of Commons after the great local banquets ; to preside at the Agricultural and Horticultural Show* dinners, to see his name as patron or president of almost all the societies or asso ciations in that part of the county, had been the principal tasks imposed upon him by his position, and he had fulfilled them with grace and dignity. The sense of being guardian over the public interests of his constituents had gradually led him to adopt tow*ards the tow*n a paternal and protecting air which was eminently pleasing to him and not at all resented by Avonham. So that now when he came to face a meeting only half sympathetic Avith him, when he was \" heckled \" by sud denly sprung-up local politicians, and when his"], [191, "CANVASSING. 179 bland and conciliatory responses w*ere stigma tised as \" blarney \" and \" soft soap,\" the old man, who was the soul of honour and tenacious of it to a degree, felt almost inclined to choke at what he called the \" unthankful depravity \" of his constituents. NeA*ertheless, the A*ery meekness with which he bore himself was one of his strongest recommendations. Alany an Avonham elector, who had felt aggrieved that the Railw*ay Bill had not been obtained for the town and w*ho had made up his mind to show Sir Headingly that he individually would submit to no further delay, came away from the meeting fully settling- hi his own mind that after all it was a shame to desert the old man, and that he, for one, would stand by him once more. Much of Sir Headingly's labour and anxiety was taken oft* his hands by his nephew. For no one in Avonham recognised more clearly than this young fellow the exact position of parties, and no one was more keenly alive to his own interests in the matter. Defeat for Sir Headingly meant just such a golden chance for Boldham and Shelman after him as his chance had been considered for the last few years. He saw* clearly that if his uncle lost 12\u20142"], [192, "180 TWO PARDONS. this seat his own political career would receive a rough check from which it would not readily recover. Sir Headingly would be so grieved at the loss of the seat that he would doubtless at once seA*er all connection with the town, and retire altogether from pohtical life. Where then would be bis chance of stepping into the shoes which he had always considered such an easy fit for him ? Gone, and nothing left for it but either to wait a new election and fight Avonham on his oavii account, or to seek another constituency under the wing of one of his uncle's political friends. AVould he get another chance ? Not very likely, for he was looked upon as being sure to retain Avonham for the party after his uncle's career was fin ished, and if this opportunity were allowed to slip, farewell to political patronage for some time to come. Thus urged on by self interest he left no stone unturned to ensure success ; he was more affable than ever ; even political opponents were not made aware of the slightest change of feeling. The younger politicians were keenly argued with, but the argument was neA*er allowed to get to the length of a dispute ; there was no fault to be found with him, and"], [193, "CANVASSING. 181 he frankly told the \" Boldhamites,\" as his uncle's opponents were called, that he was glad that the contest had occurred, as it gaA*e him an opportunity of showing his real feelings towards all in Avonham, political friend and political foe alike. Alfred Shelman came out of the ordeal A*ery much less skilfully than his rival. Never accustomed to conciliate, by nature rather aggressiA'e than yielding, Avith a hasty temper under scarcely any control, and with an ill-dis guised contempt for the people whom he had to visit and fraternise with, he compared most unfavourably Avith the suaA*e and courteous RiA*ers. If the baronet were helped by his nephew, the banker was rather hampered by bis, although Shelman w*orked hard and ener getically in his way, and took the greatest possible interest in the conflict. The Pariahs whom we mentioned before were the ones who extracted the most enjoy ment out of the turmoil. Here was a legiti mate chance for a fling at respectability at last. The heavy fathers of the town, the sobersides, were set by the ears, the youthful spirits had their turn. True, most of them had no votes, but their fathers and uncles had ; their crusade"], [194, "182 TWO PARDONS. could be carried into eA*ery household. Air. Pinniffer and the \" Bear \" Hotel did not care over much for the company of these young men, but the Blues of them mustered at the \" Great George \" and the Yellows at the \" Woolpack,\" and from these two strongholds the w-arfare was waged. Of course the first thing to be done was to vocalise the contest, so a soaring genius at the \" Great George \" decided. Having collected a chorus of boys from the Church schools and elsewhere, and enlisted them on the Blue side, he supplied them Avith a soul-stirring election song, which went to a popular tune of the day, so that the youngsters, who entered hugely into the fun of the thing and were made bold by the unwonted license of the whole surround ings, made the side streets, the smaller lanes and the \\*ery churchyard itself echo with their chant : \" \\*ote boys, do, For the old true blue ; Blue is the colour of the sky ; So vote every man For Sir 'Edin'ly Canii, And we'll make old Boldy fly.\" This, of course, was felt by the \" AVool pack \" contingent to be a political moA*ement of very deep significance, and one against"], [195, "CANVASSING. 183 w'hich a counter mine must be sprung ; after deep cogitation and much poetical outpouring, another song was evolved from the inner con sciousness of a Yellow bard, and some Yellow boys having been enlisted and duly trained, the town was made hideous with another song. The same tune w*as adopted, it being considered that a monopoly was to be denied the Blues, as it was an air well known to both parties alike. So the Yellow side sang : \" Cann, Cann, Cann, Will never be the man, And the Tories '11 say he's sold 'em And all the silly Blues Will be shaking in their shoes AVhen we bring in Mister Boldham This second effort was voted weak, and the singing boys complained that the extra feet of verse fitted the tune but ill, and that the Blue boys had the ad\\*antage. A few deserted and sang the original chant, and altogether the Yellow* party had the w*orse of the poetry. The Yellow poet, on being appealed to to remedy this defect, waxed wroth, declared that his version was infinitely superior to the other, that a redundance of feet was a positive advan tage as giA'ing the song more \" go,\" and finally threatened to transport his genius and efforts"], [196, "184 TWO PARDONS. bodily to the \" Great George \" if he w*ere bothered any more about it. His loss would have been such a dire calamity to the party that the bard was suffered to rest in peace. Air. Sennett, the mayor, had no enviable position ; he, of course, in A'irtue of his office, held the post of returning officer, and he heartily wished the whole business at the bottom of the Aa'oii. The Club was excited OA*er it. AVolstenholme and Hoppenner Pye were staunch supporters of Sir Headingly. Dr. Alompesson and Mr. Follwell, on the other hand, were just as keen for Air.

Abel Bompas had A*ery httle of Mr. Timothy Rapsey's curiosity in his composi tion. He liked, of course, to know what w*as going on around him, and took care to keep himself posted in the affairs of the town, but there was nothing obtrusive in the man. He Avould chirp (if so A'enerable an old bird might with propriety be said to chirp) at his family table over the small talk of his neigh bours, would retail Avhat he had heard in the street, or at the Club, and would hicrease his store of news from the gatherings of Airs. Bompas, who, as most plump, amiable, well preserved matrons do, dearly loA*ed a bit of gossip with a neighbour over the fragrant Souchong. This was the extent of Air. Bom pas's share in the chatter and scandal of Avonham. The confidential nature of much of his business demanded a reticence which had by degrees become customary, and the good heart of the pompous but kindly old"], [205, "MR.

Bompas at this stage of our tale, being much exercised in mind respecting cer tain occurrences taking place under his eyes, did shut himself up within himself, and ceas ing to retail to others any of the observations which he took by wholesale, gave his mind solely to taking very particular notice of cer tain events happening all rotuid him. About the election Mr. Bompas was quite easy ; he had been duly waited on by both candidates in person, and had frankly, and at once, declined to haA*e anything to do with the matter at all. He would vote for neither party, would attend no meetings, would have neither lot nor part in it. Never a politician at heart and the A*ery reverse of a noisy man, he left the struggle to those who were inter- \u00a9\u00a9 ested in it, and went on his own way. But Air. Bompas had matters nearer his own household to attend to, and circumstances affecting the well-being of his own household to w*atch ; and, first among* these matters, was the conduct of his articled pupil, Mr. Adolphus Carter. VOL. i. 13"], [206, "194 TAVO PARDONS. From time immemorial it has been accepted as an orthodox state of things that the 'pren tice, articled pupil, or probationer of any mer chant, craftsman, or professional man possess ing any daughter with good looks as a portion of her endowment, shall fall in love with the said daughter. AVhether the passion be re quited or not has nothing whatever to do with it ; the young man must bow to his fate, and the young lady likes it \u2014 expects it \u2014 looks for it as a perquisite and a right. She may not definitely accept the proffered deA*otion, but she would most assuredly feel that the foundations of apprenticeship were shaken to their centre, and that the fountains of the great deep of romance were broken up, if she did not re ceive it. Air. Adolphus Carter had, of course, followed orthodoxy as befitted the son of a country parson, and had eA*en exceeded the prescribed limits of passion, for, whereas, it is undoubtedly correct to attach oneself to one fair object in a family, Air. Carter had allowed his tender heart to become enmeshed in the toils of all three of his master's daughters. \u00a9 Until lately this had been a position of great comfort to him, and he complacently basked in the smiles of the Alisses Bompas, and was"], [207, "MR.

AVhen all the country-side youth were sighing for the fair ones, when schemes for gaining brief entrance into the pm*ate apartments of the house of the worthy auctioneer were laid with a depth and circumstantiality befitting a political plot, how blest was the lot of the fortunate youth who met the charmers every day, who was frequently partaker of the cheerful tea and the more jovial supper, and who stood well enough in his principal's graces to be able to indulge the not unreason able hope that he might effect in time a double partnership, and enter the business and the family at the same time. AVhich of the ladies he w*ould honour he had not yet made up his mind, but that was a matter which could be decided upon at leisure or perhaps might be better left to accident to determine. Mr. Adolphus had, therefore, resented as a personal injury to himself the escort which has been described in a former chapter, and the face and form of Air. Galbraith were odious to him. His nerves had been roughly shaken by their first interview* ; he had vow*ed vengeance then, but his wrath had somewhat subsided 13\u20142"], [208, "196 TAVO PARDONS. until the day of the ride to Beytesbury, which had caused it to burst forth again with increased fury. He grinned saA*agely at Galbraith when he saw him in the street, and hinted mysteri ously to his friends of a dark and dreadful fate OA'er shadowing someone whom he hated, finding \u00a9 \u00a9 in this that subtle relief w*hich little men and little minds feel in A'enting their spite on some absent and unconscious person. But after the dinner at the \" Bear \" his enemy had become insupportable ; he could stand him no longer, his very life was embittered, and made a burden to him ; not alone through his first foe, but through his friend. And this friend w*as also the cause of much heaA*y pondering to Air. Carter's employer. AVhen Mr. Galbraith's guests had consumed Air. Pinniffer's excellent dinner, and had tried and approved of the luxurious feather beds which w*ere the pride of his worthy spouse, had eaten a hearty breakfast and seen the lions of Avonham, which were few, they had driven away from the town in the highest spirits, bearing with them their host, who went to see then all off.

The negro Edward had moved a portmanteau to the \" Coombes,\" and the Avonham carrier, in a few* days, carried a portly looking and weighty trunk there from the railw*ay. This trunk at once came under the scrutiny of Mr. Rapsey, who announced that the gentleman staying with Mr. Galbraith was a certain Walter Bryceson, Esq., and Mrs. Pinniffer and Aliss Pinniffer, her rosy-cheeked daughter, declared that he was as handsome a looking young man as anyone might wish to see, w'hilst Air.

Walter Bryceson, haA*ing seen that he was in a goodly land, proceeded to make the best of it, and amused himself greatly with the town and its inhabitants; he would stroll through the market-place, cigar"], [210, "198 TAVO PARDONS. in mouth, and chat to the farmers ; he speedily knew the face of every young lady who assisted in the commerce of the town, from Miss Pinniffer, at the \" Bear,\" to the milliner's apprentices at the bridge foot, and such an admirer of the fair sex was, it may be sure, not long in discovering the pretty faces and grace ful shapes of the acknowledged belles of the town. Air. Carter was agonised to find that Air. Bryceson had obtained an introduction to Air. Bompas, and wras high in the good graces of his employer's helpmeet. So his brow* grew darker than ever, he puzzled his friends by hints still more obscure and deadly, and startled Air. Bompas greatly at times by a snappishness and abruptness which greatly discomposed him. Air. Bompas also noticed about this time that Aliss Adelaide was in the habit of blush ing in the rosiest manner wheneA*er Air. Galbraith's name Avas mentioned, and he also made the discovery that the name was men tioned A'ery frequently by the young lady's sisters, apparently with the intention of bringing about that pleasing state of con fusion ; and finally the good father made up his mind that something was amiss between"], [211, "MR.

Mr. Bompas had indeed not forgotten his perplexities, nor his friend Sennett's adAice, but he knew that his scheme would result at any rate in giA'ing his wonienkincl pleasure, so it was with feelings of complete satisfaction that he broached the subject on the day following. He commenced by alarming Airs. Bompas by what he described as the immensely inse cure position of the non-A*oting inhabitants during the election, and then proceeded to express his wish that it were possible for him to arrange for their absenting themselves for a few days from Avonham.

Bompas suggested that a visit to the seaside AA'ould perhaps be the best means of flight. But here he had reckoned without his host. Nothing but a trip to London would satisfy the young ladies. They were staunchly backed up by Mrs. Bompas, and soon carried their point. \" AVell, my dears,\" said the father, \" London be it, then. AVhen will you be ready to go ?

I shall myself be glad of a week in London, and will join you there. I shall of course accompany you there and see you settled, and then return.\" And congratulating himself on his capital tact, the worthy man left his family rejoicing at the prospect of their holiday, and went to his business with a serene mind. Mr. Adolphus Carter and the other clerks had arriA*ed, but Air. Carter had not yet com menced business. He was standing at the door of the office, scowling in a A'ery dark and unpleasant manner at two gentlemen who were passing down the other side of the street, Air. Galbraith and his friend. Air. Bompas had taken his hat from the hall as he crossed it, and he now tapped the unconscious articled pupil on the shoulder to make him sensible that he wanted to pass out into the street. Adolphus started as he felt the touch of his employer's hand, and then hastily gave him the usual morning salutation as he made way for him."], [225, "MR.

He had no sooner stepped out of his office door, however, than the young men stopped in their course and crossed the street to speak to him. Mr. Adolphus Carter, with a darker scowl than ever on his face, listened eagerly to what was being said, still retaining his place in the doorway. The customary greetings having been ex changed, the young men entered on their business. \" Mr. Bompas,\" said Galbraith, \" I am anxious to acquire, if possible, that meadow next to my lawn hedge. Can you tell me whose land it is ? \" \" It belongs, Mr. Galbraith,\" said Bompas, \" to your former landlord, or, as may be deemed more fitting, considering the fact that she is of the opposite \u2014 ah \u2014 sex, landlady, Mrs. Stan hope.\" \" She seems to own lots of land about here,\" said Mr. Bryceson, taking a cigar from his case. \" You smoke, Air.

Meanwhile his unconscious m-al made his way up the town, and, after calling at the committee-room at the \"Woolpack,\" and haA-ing a brief interview with his uncle, proceeded towards the churchyard path leading to the Priory House. He had not reached the gate, how*ever, when he espied the Alayor, who was coming towards him \u2014 to him of course he must speak. The first words of Air. Sennett did not improA*e his ill humour ; they were words of condolence on his appearance. The Alayor thought he looked ill, supposed that it was the effect of the election work, and threw in a good-natured caution not to oA*erdo matters. To all this Shelman listened, chafing the while. There was nothing specially irritating in the remarks, and he was inwardly ashamed of him self for allowing them to fret him ; so he concealed his chagrin, confessed to feeing tired, and smilingly promised to take care of himself. To his great relief the conversation took a turn, and the everlasting election topic was shelved for a time. \"I saw Millard the other night,\" said Air. Sennett, \"and he was telling me that you"], [232, "220 TAVO PARDONS. had made him an offer for the Downholmes land.\" \" Yes, I did. I want to buy some land to build on, and enough to make a kind of park on a small scale with two or three meadows and home paddocks. There is just about the right quantity in Air.

I would have built awing on each side of the present house, thrown a light iron bridge across the m*er, let my garden and lawn run down to the bank this side, and had a stream right through my property.\" \"AVhy didn't you buy it ? \" said Air. Sen nett, for once yielding to a little curiosity, for he was really anxious to know."], [233, "HOW ALFRED SHELMAN SPENT AN AFTERNOON. 221 \" I didn't know it was in the market, I assure you. I had made Mrs. Stanhope an offer for it at the time Aiajor Currie left, and she had dechned to part with it then, or eA*en to let it.

This young man was evidently A*ery peevish over something, and, besides, was good enough to assume that any matters left in the Alayor's hands for management would haA*e been sub ject to his peculiar wishes and his particular fancies.

You have the management of this, at any rate ? \" \" Yes, and full power to treat ; so if you will give me a call to-morrow* we can talk the matter over. At present I am going to a meeting of the Alarket Committee. Say eleven o'clock to-morrow morning.\" \" Arery well. Good day, Air. Alayor.\" \" Good day.\" \" Come, that's something done, at any rate,\" mused Shelman, as he turned into the church yard path. \" And now for the other matter.\" His ring at the bell of the Priory House gate brought a servant, who ushered him into the room in which, though he httle dreamed it, his rtval had successfully pleaded his suit but a few days before.

He walked unsteadily to the gate, and was thankful that no one saw him. AVhen he stood in Priory Street the ground appeared to heave, and his eyes seemed full of blood ; he paused a moment to steady himself, and looked up and down the street, uncertain which way to take. \" I must get away somewhere quietly and think this over. I'm not fit to be trusted among men. I should have murdered her in ten minutes more.\" He walked quickly down Priory Street, turned down a lane which ran past the back of Airs. Stanhope's stables, and reached the"], [247, "HOW ALFRED SHELMAN SPENT AN AFTERNOON. 235 bank of the Marden, which was crossed by a little foot-bridge ; here he sat on the rail at the side, and drawing his case from his pocket, lit a cigar, and gave himself resolutely up to getting the better of his rage. There are some tempers which terrify even those possessed of them ; such a one was Shelman's. He had startled himself by the violence of the passion which had torn his breast, nor was that passion easy to quiet. He had played his cards so badly, had blun dered so egregiously, and had laid himself so open to defeat that his reflections were of the bitterest kind ; he railed against himself, against his lost love, and against his rival un known. He gave no thought to Rivers ; the idea that he was the man who had supplanted him never occurred to him, and he puzzled his brains in vain to couple a name with the widow's. And, again, the manner of his defeat had been so galling ; what an ass he had been not to take his rejection quietly instead of letting his temper get the better of him, and run away with his reason as it had. It was an hour before he felt fit to move from the bridge and enter the town. His cigar had gone out, and had been crushed between his"], [248, "236 TWO PARDONS. fingers and plucked at and broken, and finally thrown into the little stream to sicken some nibbling gudgeon. He took another from his case, lit it, and rising from his seat strolled backwards and forwards across the bridge, and then went slowly back towards the town. His face showed clearly enough the effects which the terrible mental struggle had had on him ; it was white, and haggard, and drawn, like the face of a death-stricken man. He passed the gates of the Priory, mounted the steps of the churchyard path and crossed it, going towards the Bank. As good luck would hav*e it, there was no one in the street who noticed him, and he entered the Bank and walked through into the room behind. Here he touched the hand-bell on the table, and the chief clerk came in. \" Dear me, Air. Alfred,\" said the old gen tleman, starting, as he looked at the ashen face of his young superior, \" how ill you look, sir ; what is the matter ? \" He forced himself to speak calmly. \" I am overworked, I think, Norton, and I have been w'alking in the sun, and feel rather faint.

He opened a cupboard in the room, and taking a decanter of brandy from it, mixed himself a glass, half spirit, half water, and drank it hastily. He sat dowm again for a few minutes, still smoking, until the Bank doors were closed, and then went into the street again, crossed the market-place, and walked down South Street until he came to the office of Mr. Bompas.

INTERVIEWING. AIr. AValter Bryceson seemed very comfort able in the snug quarters of his friend Gal braith, and in no hurry to quit them. So freely had he mixed with the townspeople during the weeks which he had spent in Avon ham, that his intentions and opinions were pretty well known there. His health, he stated, was far from good, though he had rosy cheeks, a pair of bright eyes, and a merry laugh that smacked very httle of the invalid ; rest, he said, was what had been prescribed for him \u2014 rest, country air, and pure milk. The two former he partook of freely, the first from choice, the second, as he spent much of his time in the open, from necessity ; how much of the last of his requisites he took no one knew*, as no one in the town ever saw him drinking any, although it was rumoured that he quaffed enormous bowls of it in private. His looks, he declared, were fallacious and de- vol. i. 16"], [254, "242 TAVO PARDONS. ceptive in the highest degree ; nothing but a long course of invigorating Aiarlshire air would ever give him the use of his lungs and his \u00a9 \u00a9 strength again. Having gravely told this to good, motherlv, sympathising Airs. Pinniffer, he would wind up with a laugh that made the glasses ring in the bar-parlour of the \" Bear,\" and emphasize his woes with a hearty slap on her husband's back, which made the ex- Fusilier stagger. In his visits to the town he was not always accompanied by his friend and host. \" Aly friend, Galbraith,\" he would say, \" is a devilish good fellow, a devilish good fellow ; but he's a little too studious and quiet for me \u2014 too bookish, you know \u2014 bless me, my health would never stand his amount of study. No, sir, rest and fresh air is what I require, and where could I get it better ? Your air round here is pure and soft, your downs are breezy and large and healthy, your town is quiet, although it is, as you say, somewhat agitated by the election, and of course in a grazing country like this I get the richest and best of milk.

Sit dow*n and make vourself comfortable. I declare I feel better in this beautiful air already.\" It was not long, of course, before Mr. Bryceson made acquaintance with some of the leaders of the two political parties of the tow*n. His opinions were so broad that they at first shocked the politicians, and his ideas of con ducting elections were startling in the extreme.

Bryceson's schemes w*ere too much advanced for any ordinary election agent, and the mem bers of committee to whom he explained some of the most successful of transatlantic tricks upon voters held up their hands in amazement at the stories he told them. Even a royal commission might have sat at his feet and gained information. Getting thus into notice as a gentleman of somewhat advanced views \u00a9 but one who took a great interest in the com ing struggle, it was not very long before this young fellow* found himself being introduced to both the young men wiio were fighting the battle and bearing the burden of the day for their respective uncles. Shelman was disposed to treat him chuffly and with scant courtesy as not being of much use to him, but Rivers, whose plan it was to make friends of every body, took vastly to him, invited him to lunch, laughed at his stories, and was not so short sighted as to miss any of the really good suggestions for carrying on the election ; more especially did he incline his ear to those methods of annoying an adversary which Air. Bryceson had in plenty, and over which the young men laughed heartily as they smoked their cigars after lunch. Sir Head-"], [257, "INTERVIEWING. 245 ingly Cann coming into the room one day when they were thus engaged was in troduced to the stranger, and, on learning that he had spent some time in America, was interested enough to put many questions respecting some of the institutions of that country, to which he receiA*ed such bright and amusing answ*ers that he went aw*ay highly pleased with his nephew's new* acquaintance and with a cordial invitation to his house so soon as the now rapidly approaching struggle should be over. Bryceson, who did not care twopence which way the election ended, was yet more favourably disposed toward the Cann faction than the Boldham. He accepted the invitation and wished the Baronet success. Meanwhile Galbraith went on in his old quiet way ; of course the friends were often together, but Bryceson was about the town alone a great deal in search of that fresh air which he aA*erred was so indispensable to his well-being.

He seemed as much at his ease at the \" AVoolpack \" with Air. Boldham's party as he did at the \" Great George \" among the supporters of Sir Headingly Cann, though his favourite house was the \" Bear,\" where he made himself thoroughly at home . It chanced one day that he was passing* up the street in company with one of the young men of the town, with whom he had struck up a friendship, when outside the shop of Air. Pol limoy, the traveller, the Royahst, the stationer, they saw the carriage of Airs. Stanhope, the leader of society in Avonham, as Air. Bryceson was informed by his companion. Airs. Stanhope was leaning back in the carriage, listening to some explanation which Air. Pollimoy, who stood bareheaded by the side, was giving her. After a few moments' conversation, the sta tioner returned to the shop and presently emerged with a specimen of the particular article she w*as wanting, and handing it to her explained that he had a variety within. Bryceson left the arm of his friend for a moment, and excusing himself walked into the shop. He requested to look at some small article, which he had noticed in the window,"], [259, "INTERVIEWING. 247 and was examining it most attentively when Airs. Stanhope, having been coaxed out of her carriage by the obsequious Pollimoy, entered the shop. On that side of the counter where Bryceson was standing there was only one chair, which he immediately handed to the lady with a bow. Mrs. Stanhope thanked him, and taking the chair proceeded to explain to Air. Pollimoy how she wished her order exe cuted. Bryceson, who was waited upon by Aliss Ruth Polhmoy, a rosy-cheeked, bright eyed damsel, also busied himself about sta tionery, and seemed absorbed in the business. It was a business which necessitated a good deal of search on the part of Miss Ruth, and some apology as to giving trouble was needed. Air. Bryceson seemed to want a good many httle knick-knacks ; a card-case, a pocket book (which took some httle time to select), a leather purse (several bead ones having been inspected and rejected), and a pen-knife were already marked down, and the young friend outside, tired of waiting, had strolled up the street, and stdl Mrs. Stanhope sat in the shop or moved from side to side making selections of small articles, or giving instructions for the order of new dainties in leather and gilt-edged"], [260, "248 TWO PARDONS. paper ; still, also, Bryceson remained and kept Aliss Ruth employed. Air. Pollimoy beamed with joy and regarded both purchasers with eyes of favour. A glass ink bottle, a hundred envelopes, an ivory paper-cutter, and a pack of playing cards were added to the gentleman's list, when the lady rose to go. Mr. Pollimoy accompanied her to the carriage, and bowed profoundly as she drove off. Bryceson wanted change, it appeared, when he came back to his shop \u2014 had nothing but a bank note for ten pounds ; Pollimoy was sorry to keep Air. Bryceson waiting, but would have to send to the Bank for the money. The customer was perfectly affable and chatted agreeably whilst waiting for his change. Air. Pollimoy informed him that the lady who had just gone out was a widow, very well off too, nice lady and quite the leader of the town. Bryceson listened politely, but seemed uninterested in the sub ject, and, the change arriving, took his leave, ordering the goods he had purchased to be sent up to the \" Coombes.\" AVhen he rejoined his companion, however, he appeared to have for gotten what the stationer had told him, for he asked two or three questions about the lady, and on hearing that she was a rich widow*,"], [261, "INTERVIEWING. 249 declared he would make love to her him self. \" I'm afraid you wouldn't have much chance,\" said the friend. \" Pooh, nonsense, my dear fellow,\" said Bryceson, \" these widows always want fresh husbands.\" \" Yes, and there are twro or three who w*ould like to marry her too ! \" \" Humph, how long has she been a widow ? \" \" About four years.\" \" Ah ! well, she's a good-looking widow, and a rich one, and here's her very good health, and her ' next wentur's.' \" \" Then you give her up ? \" \" Not a bit of it \u2014 Miss Pinniffer, aren't you going to make me a rosette for the election ? \" \" AVhat colours will you have, Mr. Bryceson,\" said rosy Miss Pinniffer ; \" blue or yellow ? \" \" Both \u2014 both certainly \u2014 half blue and half yellow.

Friday was market day, and being the second Friday in the month was also cheese market, and consequently the town was full. The \" pitch \" of cheese was not large in this par ticular month, and the covered part of the market yard sufficed for that commodity. The bulls as usual were attached to stout posts in the upper part of the market-place, where they remained (unless sold and driven off) all day with angry eyes and parched lips, until they were released at four o'clock to go charging down the street to the welcome water, where they were reclaimed by their A*arious owners and w*ere driven home. The sheep w*ere hustled into pens, and the poultry cackled and screamed, the taverns reeked with hot brandy and-water and tobacco, and the tables at the farmers' ordinaries were heaped with solids and fluids of the most substantial sort. On this occasion Air. Alillard, of Beytesbury, had ridden in on his rare old cob, and having put up his nag, w*as wending his way down South Street to call on Mr. Bompas, when he met Galbraith, who, with his friend Bryce son, was going towards the market-place. A cordial greeting took place between the three, and when Air.

Air. Bompas had not been in the house since he had sold it to Gal braith ; Air. Alillard had never visited it at all, and both were somewhat glad of the oppor tunity of seeing the interior of a residence of which so much was talked, and so very httle know*n. Entering the dining-room by the back way through the French windows that looked out on to the lawn and the river beyond, Galbraith summoned the black servant, who presented himself to the eyes of the two visitors clad in the white jean suit winch is the usual costume of the negro attendants in American hotels, and which set off the black face and woolly hair of the African to perfection. \" Brino* some drinks, Edward,\" said his master, without entering into details, and shortly after, a host of decanters, large and small, two flasks of champagne, ice, sugar, soda-water, lemons, and iced water made their appearance on a large tray. \" Now, Air.

Alillard, have you any choice ? \" \" Really, my dear sir, so long as the drink is cool and refreshing, I have no choice,\" said Alillard ; \" there is such a large variety here that I should have some difficulty in making a selection.\" Mr. Bompas was of the same opinion. \" A^ery well, Edward, then go to work as you hke.

He then presented to the two visitors a beA*erage in beaded glasses, topped with glittering ice and fragrant as a nosegay. Both the old fellows applied them selves to the straw*s, and when their jovial faces looked up there was on each that expression of sweetly satisfied content that is best seen after a cool draught on a broiling day. \" Upon my word,\" said Millard, setting bis goblet down on the table beside him and looking round as if to emphasize his speech \u2014 \" upon my word, Mr. Galbraith, I do not remember that I ever tasted anything so capital in my life.\" \" Alost admirable,\" chimed in Bompas ; \" perfectly delicious.
