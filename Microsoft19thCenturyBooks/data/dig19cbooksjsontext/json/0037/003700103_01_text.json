Never theless, it has been judged expedient in the present edition to introduce some additional matter ; the motives to which may deserve to be explained. It having been suggested, a few years ago, that it might be well to bring duwn the Elements of General History, from the period where Professor Tytler had terminated his labours, as nearly as could be to our own times, an attempt was made to do so in a Third Volume, published in 1822, and comprehending the space intermediate a 3"], [12, "VI ADVERTISEMENT. between the end of the reigns of Lewis XIV. and Queen Anne, and the demise of George III. In the course of the above undertaking, the author's attention was naturally drawn, more than might otherwise have been the case, to the form and composition of the first Two Volumes ; and comparing them with the title of \" Elements of General History,\" and considering that they were in use, not merely in the universities of the land, but in all respectable schools and semin aries, he could not help thinking that, though they might require no very essential alteration, yet that they fell too much under the descrip tion given by the learned author himself, of the Disconrs sur VHistoire Universelle of the cele brated Bossuet, namely, that \" though it was a work of great merit, it was rather useful to those who had already studied history in detail, for uniting in the mind, the great current of events, and recalling to the memory their order and connection, than fitted to convey information to the uninstructed.\" \u2014 The very title of \" Ele ments\" evidently seems to apply more to the uninstructed than the initiated. But the learned and ingenious author himself supplies the best excuse for all that has been attempted in the present edition ; for in the ad-"], [13, "ADVERTISEMENT. VII vertisement prefixed to his own Second Edition, he acknowledges that \" several errors had been corrected, a few omissions supplied, and some amplifications made in the text where they seemed necessary for the better illustration of the subject,\" and that \" the whole work had undergone a revisal.\" Nothing but what is entirely consistent with the above passage has been attempted in the present edition ; and in order to run no risk of interfering with the established credit of the original work, the author of the additions now made, has been careful to include within brackets, all that has proceeded from himself that no reader may be deceived ; hereafter it may of course be found expedient to incor- porate them with the original text. If ampli- fication alone had been the object, there is scarcely a section that might not have admitted of some enlargement; especially, considering the immense amount of modern publications, tend- ing to throw more or less light on different por- tions of history, or periods of time, from the very earliest ages to the present day : but wherever the original work was judged to be already full enough, or the author's own opinions seemed to be deliberately expressed, on parti- a 4"], [14, "ADVERTISEMENT. VIII cular subjects, especially on topics still open to discussion (not to say litigation or controversy), the text has been scrupulously left as it was. Though the pages in this edition, as in former ones, will appear, unencumbered with notes and references, yet it may be well to observe, that with regard to the latter, they are all preserved, as vouchers for every word of new matter ; and that nothing has been altered or interpolated but upon such respectable authority, as would probably have had weight with the learned author himself. So much attention, indeed, has been paid to this, that not unfrequently, the smallest additions or corrections have been found to give the most trouble ; as an instance of which, we may state the following circum stance. In all prior editions, at the battle of Fontenoy in France, in the year 84>1, as many as one million, expressed in figures 1,000,000, are stated to have fallen in the field. It was not difficult to suspect an error ; but it was not easy to correct it, for few authors mention the number. It was easy to strike out a cypher ; but an authority was still wanting. At length in an English Edition of Voltaire's Universal History, the number was found to be, in figures 100,000, and doubts expressed of course, whe-"], [15, "ADVERTISEMENT. IX ther there might not have been some exagger ation. This was probably no mistake of the learned Professor; but that such a misprint should have so long escaped detection is cer tainly surprising. In another part of the work, there are two misprints of Priuli for Friuli, the Dukedom of Berengarius, competitor of the Emperor Arnold, towards the end of the ninth century. Friuli happens to be a place well known, in ancient times, as the Forum Julii, preserved in its more modern name ; Priuli therefore was a gross mistake and should have been sooner detected. It is certainly singular enough, but true, that the very same mistake is to be found in the English Edition of Voltaire already mentioned. It would, however, be needless, and might by some perhaps be thought invidious, to insist upon all the errors that have been detected, in a work which came perhaps as perfect from the hands of the original author, as any other that could be named ; but it is certainly not too much to say with regard to the present Edition, that even to the very last of those previously delivered to the public, some errors of consider able importance appear to have passed current through schools and universities without, de-"], [16, "ADVERTISEMENT.

The value of any science is to be estimated according to its tendency to promote improve ment, either in private virtue, or in those qua lities which render man extensively useful in society. \u2014 Some objects of pursuit have a se condary utility ; in furnishing rational amuse ment, which, relieving the mind at intervals from the fatigue of serious occupation, invigo rates and prepares it for fresh exertion. It is the perfection of any science, to unite these advantages, to promote the advancement of public and private virtue, and to supply such a degree of amusement, as to supersede the necessity of recurring to frivolous pursuits for the sake of relaxation. Under this description falls the science of History. 2. History, says Dionysius of Halicarnassus, is \" Philosophy teaching by examples.\" The VOL.

History, which adds to our own experience an immense treasure of the experience of others, furnishes innumerable proofs, by which we may verify all the precepts of morality and of prudence. 3. History, besides its general advantages, has a distinct species of utility to different men, according to their several ranks in society, and occupations in life. 4. In this country, it is an indispensable duty of every man of liberal birth to be acquainted, in a certain degree, with the science of Politics ; and History is the school of Politics. It opens to us the springs of human affairs ; the causes of the rise, grandeur, revolutions, and fall of empires : It points out the reciprocal influence of government and of national manners : It dis- sipates prejudices, nourishes the love of our country, and directs to the best means of its im provement : It illustrates equally the blessings of political union, and the miseries of faction ;"], [31, "3 INTRODUCTION. the danger, on the one hand, of uncontrolled liberty, and, on the other, the debasing influence of despotic power. 5. It is necessary that the study of History should be prosecuted according to a regular plan ; for this science, more perhaps than any other, is liable to perversion from its proper use. With some, it is no better than an idle amuse ment ; with others, it is the food of vanity ; with a third class, it fosters the prejudices of party, and leads to political bigotry. It is dangerous for those who, even with the best intentions, seek for historical knowledge, to pursue the study without a guide ; for no science has been so little methodised. The sources of prejudice are infinite ; and the mind of youth should not be left undirected amidst the erring, the partial, and contradictory representations of Historians. Besides the importance of being able to dis criminate truth from falsehood, the attention ought to be directed only to useful truths. \u2014 Much danger arises from the perusal of me moirs, collections of anecdotes, &c. ; for many of those works exhibit the most depraved pic tures, weaken our confidence in virtue, and present the most unfavourable views of human b 2"], [32, "4 INTRODUCTION. nature. \u2014 [Epistolary correspondence has some thing in it of a different nature : partaking of the character both of memoirs and anecdote, it may yet be found to contain not only much of real history, but of history that would not otherwise have been known, and that conveyed to us in a style and manner, more animated and particular, than can often be said to be the case with any other records or historical documents whatsoever, according to the remark of Bacon : \" Epistol\u00e6, magis in proximo at ad vivum negotia solent representare, quam vel annales vel vita.\" Much, however, will of course depend on the import ance of the times and events to which such cor respondence may relate, as well as on the talents, dignity, or station of the writer.] 6. There are many difficulties which attend the attempt of forming a proper plan of study, and giving an instructive view of General History. Utility is to be reconciled with amusement, pre judices are to be encountered, variety of taste to be consulted, political opinions balanced, judgment and decision exercised on topics keenly controverted. The proposer of such a plan ought, therefore, to be possessed equally of firmness of mind, and moderation of sentiment."], [33, "5 INTRODUCTION.

Disregarding every partial and inferior con sideration, he must direct his view solely to the proper end of all education, \u2014 the forming of good men, and of good citizens. 7. The object and general purpose of the fol lowing Course, is to exhibit a progressive view of the state of mankind, from the earliest ages of which we have any authentic accounts, down to the close of the 17th century, \u2014 to delineate the origin of states and of empires, the great outlines of their history, the revolutions which they have undergone, the causes which have contributed to their rise and grandeur, and operated to their decline and extinction.

While so much regard is had to Chronology as is necessary for showing the progress of man kind in society, and communicating just ideas of the state of the world in all the different ages to which authentic history extends, we shall, in the delineation of the rise and fall of empires, and their revolutions, pay more attention to the connection of Subject than that of Time. In this view, we must reject the common me thod of arranging General History according to epochs, or eras. When the world is viewed at any period, either of ancient or of modern history, we gene rally observe one nation or empire predominant, to whom all the rest bear, as it were, an under part, and to whose history we find that the principal events in the annals of other nations may be referred from some natural connection.

The Jewish history, belonging to a different department of academical education, enters not into the plan of these Lectures ; though we often resort to the sacred writings for detached facts illustrative of the manners of ancient nations. In the ancient world, among the profane na tions, the Greeks are the earliest people who make a distinguished figure, and whose history is at the same time authentic. The Greeks owed their civilisation to the Egyptians and Ph\u0153nicians.

Various notions have been formed with re spect to the population of the antediluvian world and its physical appearance; but as these are rather matters of theory than of fact, they scarcely fall within the province of history ; and they are of the less consequence, that we are certain the state of those antediluvian ages could have had no material influence on the times which succeeded them* c 2"], [48, "20 ANCIENT HISTORY.

Ninus the son of Belus, and his queen Semi ramis, [particularly the latter,] are said to have raised the empire of Assyria to a higher degree of splendour. From the death of Ninias the son of Ninus [andSemiramis,] down to the revolt of the Medes under Sardanapalus, a period of 800 years, there is a chasm in the history of Assyria and Babylon.

II. CONSIDERATIONS ON THE NATURE OF THE FIRST GOVERNMENTS, AND ON THE LAWS, CUSTOMS, ARTS, AND SCIENCES OF THE EARLY AGES. \u00a7 1. The earliest Government is the Patriarchal, which subsists in the rudest periods of society. The patriarchal government leads by an easy progress to the monarchical. The first monarchies must have been very weak, and their territory extremely limited. The idea of security precedes that of conquest. In forming our notions of the extent of the first monarchies, we are deceived by the word King, which, according to modern ideas, is con nected with an extent of territory, and a pro- c 3"], [50, "PART I. 22 ANCIENT HISTORY. portional power. \u2014 The kings in Scripture are no more than the chiefs of tribes. There were five kings in the vale of Sodom. Joshua de feated in his wars thirty-one kings, and Adoni zedec threescore and ten. The regal office was in all probability at first elective. The transmission of the sceptre to the heir of the last monarch arises, in time, from the experience of the r ischiefs attending fre quent elections, and the disorders occasioned by ambitious men aspiring at that dignity. The first ideas of conquest must have pro ceeded from a people in the state of shepherds, who, necessarily changing their pastures, would probably make incursions on the appropriated territory of their neighbours. Such were the Arabian or Ph\u0153nician invaders, who, under the name of Shepherd -kings, conquered Egypt. But kingdoms so founded could have little duration. Laws, and good policy, essential to the stability of kingdoms, are the fruit of intellectual refine ment, and arise only in a state of society con siderably advanced in civilisation. The progress from barbarism to civilisation is slow : because every step in the progress is the result of necessity, after the experience of an error, or the strong feeling of a want."], [51, "SECT. 2. 23 ANCIENT HISTORY. [It has perhaps been rather too generally con cluded, that the gradations have been regular from the state of hunters and fishers subsisting upon wild animals, through the pastoral or shep herd-state, to the agricultural ; the foundation of fixed and settled property. But the strong attachment of the rudest or savage tribes to the peculiarities of their mode of life seldom, if ever, allowing them to pass spontaneously even so far as to the pastoral state, tends rather to show that the course of things has been different ; that accidental discoveries having conduced to the amelioration of particular regions, civilisation has been propagated from thence as from a cen tre, correcting in its progress some error, or supplying some want, in the neighbouring parts, till barbarism has been subdued, or brought to give way, to the adventitious refinements of a higher civilisation. It was thus that Greece was civilised by colonies from Egypt and Ph\u0153 nicia, Italy by Asiatic and Grecian adventurers, our own country, in the first instance, by the Roman invaders, and the whole continent of America by the Europeans of modern days.} \u00a7 2. Origin of Laws. \u2014 Certain political wri ters have supposed, that in the infancy, of so- c 4"], [52, "PART I. 24 ANCIENT HISTORY. ciety penal laws must have been extremely mild. We presume the contrary to have been rather the case ; as the more barbarous the people, the stronger must be the bonds to restrain them ; and history confirms the supposition, in the an cient laws of the Jews, Egyptians, Greeks, Ro mans, and Gauls. Among the earliest laws of all states are those regarding marriage ; for the institution of mar riage is coeval with the formation of society. The first sovereigns of all states are said to have instituted marriage; and the earliest laws pro vided encourai ements to matrimony. Among the ancient nations, the husband pur chased his wife, by money, or personal services. Among the Assyrians the marriageable women were put up to auction ; and the price obtained for the more beautiful was assigned as a dowry to the more homely. The Laws of Succession are next in order to those of marriage. The father had the absolute power in the division of his estate. But primo geniture was understood to confer certain rights. Laws arise necessarily and imperceptibly from the condition of society ; and each particular law may be traced from the state of manners, or the political emergency which gave it birth."], [53, "SECT. 2. ANCIENT HISTORY. 25 Hence we perceive the intimate connection be tween history and jurisprudence, and the light which they must necessarily throw upon each other. The laws of a country are best inter preted from its history ; and its uncertain history is best elucidated by its ancient laws. \u00a7 3. Earliest Methods of authenticating Con tracts. \u2014 Before the invention of writing, con tracts, testaments, sales, marriages, and the like, were transacted in public. \u2014 The Jewish and the Grecian histories furnish many examples. \u2014 Some barbarous nations authenticate their bar gains by exchanging symbols or tallies. \u2014 The Peruvians accomplished most of the purposes of writing by knotted cords of various colours, termed Quipos. \u2014 The Mexicans communicated intelligence to a distance by painting. \u2014 Other nations used an abridged mode of painting, or hieroglyphics. \u2014 Before the use of writing, the Egyptians used hieroglyphics for transmitting and recording knowledge : after writing, they employed it for veiling or concealing it from the vulgar. \u00a7 4. Methods for recording Historical Facts and publisliing Laws. \u2014 Poetry and song were"], [54, "26 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. the first vehicles of history, and the earliest mode of promulgating laws. The songs of the bards record a great deal of ancient history : the laws of many of the ancient nations were com posed in verse. Stones, rude and sculptured, tumuli and mounds of earth, are the monuments of history among a barbarous people ; and columns, trium phal arches, coins, and medals, among a more refined. \u2014 These likewise illustrate the progress of manners and of the arts. \u00a7 5. Religious Institutions. \u2014 Among the ear liest institutions of all nations, are those which regard religious worship. The sentiment of religion is deeply rooted in the human mind. An uninstructed savage will infer the existence of a God, and his attributes, from the general order and mechanism of nature ; and even its temporary irregularities lead to a religious vene ration or dread of the unknown Power which conducts it. Before conceiving the idea of a being utterly imperceptible to his senses, a savage would na turally seek that Being in the most striking ob jects of sense to which he owed his most appa rent benefits. The sun, extending his beneficial"], [55, "SECT. 2. ANCIENT HISTORY. 27 influence over all nature, was among the earliest objects of worship. The fire presented a sym bol of the sun. The other celestial bodies na turally attracted their share of veneration. [But the storm and the tempest had their votaries also ; nor can it be fairly alleged, that a sense of beneficence was the only excitement to religious feeling : there constantly existed a strange pro pensity to cruel and sanguinary rites, to appease deities of a malevolent cast, or conciliate aveng ing demons ; sig ?ujt\u00a7ov roig \"rtpuogiMj 8ct.ju.wrt, as Philo renders the account given of the Ph\u0153ni cian sacrifices by Sanchoniathon], The symbolical mode of writing led to many peculiarities of the idolatrous worship of the ancient nations. Animals, symbolical of the attributes of Deity, became gods themselves. The same god, represented by different animals, was supposed to have changed himself into dif ferent forms. \u2014 The gratitude and veneration for men whose lives had been eminently useful, joined to the belief of the soul's immortality, led to the apotheosis of heroes. \u2014 Many excel lent reflections on idolatry and polytheism are found in the apochryphal book called The Wis dom of Solomon. The priesthood was anciently exercised by the"], [56, "28 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. chief or monarch ; but as an empire became ex tensive, the monarch exercised this office by his delegates ; and hence an additional source of veneration for the priesthood. The priests were the framers and the administrators of the laws. \u00a7 6. Arts and Sciences of the Ancient Nations. \u2014 The useful arts are the offspring of necessity ; the sciences are the fruit of ease and leisure. The construction of huts, of weapons of war, and of hunting, are the earliest arts. Agriculture is not practised till the tribe becomes stationary, and property is defined and secured. The sciences arise in a cultivated society, where individuals enjoy that leisure which in vites to study and speculation. The priests, maintained in that condition by the monarch, were the earliest cultivators of science. The Egyptian science was confined to the priests. Astronomy, which is among the earliest of the sciences, owed its origin probably to supersti tion. Medicine was among the early sciences. All rude nations have a pharmacy of their own, equal in general to their wants. Luxury, creat ing new and more complex diseases, requires a profounder knowledge of medicine, and of the animal economy."], [57, "SECT. 3. 29 ANCIENT HISTORY. III. OF THE EGYPTIANS. 1. A great portion of the knowledge and attainments of the ancient nations, and by con sequence of those of the moderns, is to be traced to Egypt. The Egyptians instructed the Greeks ; they performed the same office to the Romans ; and the two latter have transmitted much of that knowledge to the world of which we are in pos session at this day. * 2. The antiquity of this empire, though we give no credit to the chronicles of Manetho, [which, like those of the Chaldeans, Chinese, and Indians, appear clearly to have been more astro nomical than historical,] must be allowed to be very great. \u2014 The Mosaic writings represent Egypt, about 430 years after the flood, as a flourishing and well-regulated kingdom. \u2014 The nature of the country itself affords a presump tion of the great antiquity of the empire, and its early civilisation. \u2014 From the fertilising effects of the waters of the Nile, it is probable that * For the supposed origin of Egyptian science, see Part II. Sect. 50."], [58, "30 PART I, ANCIENT HISTORY. agriculture would be more early practised there, than in regions less favoured by nature. \u2014 The periodical inundations of the Nile are owing to the vapours of the Mediterranean condensed on the mountains of Ethiopia. 3. The government of Egypt was a hereditary monarchy. \u2014 The powers of the Monarch were limited by constitutional laws ; yet in many re spects his authority was extremely despotical. \u2014 The functions of the Sovereign were partly civil and partly religious. \u2014 The King had the chief regulation of all that regarded the worship of the gods ; and the priests, considered as his deputies, [and having more skill and learning than the other orders,] filled all the offices of state. They were both the legislators and the civil judges ; they imposed and levied the taxes, and regulated weighs and measures. \u2014 The great national tribunal was composed of thirty judges, chosen from the three principal depart ments [or cities] of the empire, \u2014 [Heliopolis, Thebes, and Memphis.] \u2014 The administration of justice was defrayed by the Sovereign, [who exacted an oath from his judges, not to yield obedience even to himself, if he passed any unjust sentence,] and, as parties were their own advocates, the expence was no burden upon the people. [So tender were they in regard to the"], [59, "6EiCT\u00ab c?\u00bb ANCIENT HISTORY. 31 purity and impartiality of their decisions, that, besides excluding professed advocates and public pleaders, that no extraordinary gifts of oratory might mislead them, every case was laid before them in writing, that the parties might stand on an equal footing, and on the exact merits of the question.] \u2014 The penal laws of Egypt were un commonly severe. \u2014 Female chastity was most rigidly protected, [and personal security so guard ed by the laws, that whoever saw another attack ed, and neglected to render him assistance, was liable to be punished as an assassin.] \u2014Funeral rites were not conferred but after a scrutiny into the life of the deceased, aud by a judicial decree approving of his character. The characters even of the sovereigns were subjected to this enquiry. [Daily, indeed, during their lives, in the morning service of the temple, and in the pre sence of the whole court, were their kings, in a remarkable manner, and with singular delicacy, so reminded of c/ery regal virtue, and of the baseness of every opposite quality, as pretty generally to ensure their conformity to the laws; as a proof of which, most of them are reported to have passed the last ordeal of the posthumous judgment before mentioned, with credit and re spect, and to have been, on their deaths, very sincerely lamented by their subjects.]"], [60, "32 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. There was an extraordinary regulation in Egypt regarding the borrowing of money. [As it was usual to preserve, in a remarkable manner, the dead bodies of their ancestors,] the borrower gave in pledge the body of his father, and was deprived of funeral rites if he failed to re deem it. Population was encouraged by law ; and every man was bound to maintain and educate the children born to him of his slaves. 3. The manners of the Egyptians were very early formed. They had a singular attachment to ancient usages ; a dislike to innovation ; a jealousy and abhorrence of strangers. 4. They preceded most of the ancient nations in the knowledge of the useful arts, and in the cultivation of the sciences. \u2014 Architecture was early brought to great perfection. \u2014 Their build ings, the pyramids, obelisks, &c. have, from the mildness of the climate, suffered little injury from time. \u2014 Pliny describes the contrivance for transporting the obelisks. \u2014 The whole country abounds with the remains of ancient magnifi cence. \u2014 Thebes, in Upper Egypt, was one of the most splendid cities in the universe. The pyramids are supposed to have been erected about 900 years B. C. \u2014 They were"], [61, "SECT. 3. 33 ANCIENT HISTORY. probably the sepulchral monuments of the So vereigns. The Egyptians believed that death did not separate the soul from the body ; and hence their extreme care to preserve the body entire, by embalming, concealing it in caves and catacombs, and guarding it by such stupendous structures. \u2014 Mr. Bruce supposes the pyramids to be rocks hewn into a pyramidal form, and encrusted, where necessary, with mason-work. The remains of art in Egypt, though vene rable for their great antiquity, are extremely deficient in beauty and elegance. \u2014 The Egyp tians were ignorant of the construction of an arch. \u2014 The remains of painting and sculpture evince but a slender proficiency in those arts. [Their use of symbols and hieroglyphics is too well known to be insisted upon. They appear not only to have taken the lead in such kinds of allegorical painting, but to have surpassed most other nations in the obscurity and mysticism of their fictions.] 5. The Egyptians possessed considerable know ledge of geometry, mechanics, and astronomy. They had divided the zodiac into twelve signs ; they calculated eclipses ; and seem to have had an idea of the motion of the earth. VOL. I. D"], [62, "34 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. b'. The morality taught by the priests was pure and refined ; but it had little influence on the manners of the people. 7. So likewise the theology and secret doc trines of the priests were rational and sublime ; but the worship of the people was debased by the most absurd and contemptible superstition. [We know, upon the authority of the sacred writings, how addicted they were to magic, and enchantments, though the grounds and extent of their operations have constantly eluded the enquiries and researches of the learned. They appear to have been a combination of the mys teries and delusions of astrology and demon ology, but by what arts or influence they managed to impose on the senses of mankind must for ever remain in obscurity.] 8. Notwithstanding the early civilisation and the great attainments of this people, their na tional character was extremely low and despicable among the contemporary nations of antiquity. The reason of this is, they were a people who chose to sequestrate themselves from the rest of mankind ; they were not known to other na tions by their conquests ; they had little con nection with them by commerce ; and they had 18"], [63, "SECT. 3. ANCIENT HISTORY. 35 an antipathy to the persons and manners of strangers. 9. There were likewise many circumstances of their own manners which tended to degrade them in the opinion of other nations. \u2014 All pro fessions were hereditary in Egypt, and the rank of each was scrupulously settled : [the principle upon which they acted in this arrangement of things was in itself not discreditable ; for the intention was, that no person should be excused or exempt from serving the community, and that all professions and employments should on this ground be accounted honourable ; but in a prac tical point of view nothing could be more ad verse to all emulation, and all improvement.] The objects of the religious worship were dif ferent in different parts of the kingdom ; a fertile source of division and controversy : their parti cular superstitions were of the most absurd and debasing nature ; and the manners of the people were extremely loose and profligate. [It has been doubted whether their hieroglyphics were the cause of their worshipping such a variety of animals, or the variety of objects of worship the origin of their hieroglyphics.] d 2"], [64, "36 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. IV. OF THE PH\u0152NICIANS. 1. The Ph\u0153nicians, [occupying the narrow tract of country between Syria and Judea to the north and south, and the Mediterranean sea to the west,] were among the most early civilised nations of the East. We are indebted to them for the invention of writing, [possibly also of arithmetic and astronomy,] and for the first at tempts at commercial navigation ; [to which they were very naturally led by the convenience of their harbours, and the excellent materials for ship-building with which the surrounding mountains abounded: \u2014 The \"fir trees of Senir, the cedars of Lebanon, and the oaks of Bashan.\" Ezekiel, xx vii. ] \u2014 The fragments of Sanchoniath on are the most ancient monuments of writing after the books of Moses. Sanchoniathon was contem porary with Joshua, about 1440 B. C. and 500 before the cities of Attica were united by Theseus. 2. The Ph\u0153nicians (the Canaanites of Scrip-"], [65, "SECT. 4.

[3. The Ph\u0153nicians appear to have made an early progress in manufactures. The glass of Sidon, the purple and fine linen of Tyre, were held in high estimation ; through their neigh bours, the Syrians, they trafficked largely with the eastern countries, distributing the products of the latter in the west ; the whole commerce of which, they may be said, for many years to have engrossed, being jealous of all interference. The circumnavigation of Africa, in the time of Nechos, king of Egypt, six centuries before the birth of our Saviour, if entitled to credit, was entrusted to Ph\u0153nicians.} d 3"], [66, "38 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. V. THE HISTORY OF GREECE. 1. Greece being indebted for the first rudi ments of civilisation to the Egyptians and Ph\u0153 nicians, its history is properly introduced by an account of those more ancient nations. 2. The early antiquities of this country are disguised by fable ; but from the time when it becomes important, it has been treated of by eminent writers. 3. The ancient inhabitants of Greece, the Pelasgi, Hiantes, Leleges, were extremely bar barous ; but a dawning of civilisation arose under the Titans, a Ph\u0153nician or Egyptian colony, who settled in the country about the time of Moses. \u2014 The Titans gave the Greeks the first ideas of religion, and introduced the worship of their own gods, Saturn, Jupiter, Ceres, &c. Succeeding ages confounded those Titans them selves with the gods, and hence sprung number less fables. 4. Inachus, the last of the Titans, founded the kingdom of Argos, 1856 B. C. \u2014 And Egialeus, one of his sons, the kingdom of Sicyon ;"], [67, "SECT. 5. 39 ANCIENT HISTORY. [though, if we might trust to some of the earlier records of Sicyon, it would appear to have been founded more than two centuries before Argos. Its modern name of Basilico has, indeed, been considered, by some grave writers, as a standing proof and memorial of its being the most an cient kingdom of Greece ; but we think without sufficient foundation.] 5. In the following century happened the deluge of Ogyges, 1796 B. C. \u2014 Then followed a period of barbarism for above 200 years. 6. Cecrops, the leader of another colony from Egypt, landed in Attica, 1582 B. C, and, con necting himself with the last king, succeeded, on his death, to the sovereignty. [Having opened his country as an asylum to the innocent and persecuted,] he built twelve cities, [Athens amongst others, originally called after himself Cecropia,] and was eminent both as a lawgiver and politician. 7. The Grecian History derives some authen ticity at this period from the Chronicle of Paros, preserved among the Arundelian marbles at Oxford. \u2014 The authority of this Chronicle has been questioned of late, and many arguments adduced, presumptive of its being a forgery ; but on a review of the whole controversy, we d 4"], [68, "PART I. 40 ANCIENT HISTORY. judge the arguments for its authenticity to pre ponderate. It fixes the dates of the most re markable events in the history of Greece, from the time of Cecrops down to the age of Alex ander the Great. 8. Cranaus succeeded Cecrops, in whose time happened two remarkable events recorded in the Chronicle of Paros, \u2014 the judgment of the Areopagus between Mars and Neptune, two princes of Thessaly ; and the deluge of Deu calion. \u2014 The court of Areopagus, at Athens, was instituted by Cecrops. The number of its judges varied at different periods from nine to fifty-one. [Judgment wras pronounced in the open air by night, after the most simple exposi tion of matters, and its decisions have been declared by Demosthenes to have been in variably just and impartial.] \u2014 The deluge of Deucalion, magnified and disguised by the poets, was probably only a partial inundation. 9. Amphictyon, the contemporary of Cranaus, if the founder of the Amphictyonic Council, must have possessed extensive views of policy. \u2014 This council, from a league of twelve cities, became a representative assembly of the states of Greece, and had the most admirable political effects in uniting the nation, and giving it a"], [69, "SECT. 6. 41 ANCIENT HISTORY. common interest. [The assemblies met some times at Thermopyl\u00e6, sometimes at Delphi. Their decisions also were held in great vener ation.] 10. Cadmus, about 1519 B. C. introduced alphabetic writing into Greece from Ph\u0153nicia. \u2014 The alphabet then had only sixteen letters; and the mode of writing (termed Boustrophedon) was alternately from left to right, and right to left. \u2014 From this period, [supposed to be coin cident with the settlement of the Israelites under Joshua, in the land of Canaan, whereby many of the Ph\u0153nicians \" were probably driven to seek refuge in other countries,] the Greeks made ra pid advances in civilisation. \u2014 [Cadmus is re ported to have taught them the use of the vine, and all the processes of metallurgy.] VI. REFLECTIONS ON THE FIRST AND RUDEST PERIODS OF THE GRECIAN HISTORY. 1. The country of Greece presents a large, irregular peninsula, intersected by many chains of mountains, separating its different districts, and opposing natural impediments to general intercourse, and therefore to rapid civilisation."], [70, "PART I. 42 ANCIENT history. \u2014 The extreme barbarism of the Pelasgi, who are said to have been cannibals, and ignorant of the use of fire, has its parallel in modern bar barous nations. \u2014 There wTere many circum stances that retarded the progress of the Greeks to refinement. The introduction of a national religion was best fitted to remove these ob stacles. Receiving this new system of Theology from strangers, and entertaining at first very confused ideas of it, they would naturally blend its doctrines and worship with the notions of religion which they formerly possessed ; and hence we observe only partial coincidences of the Grecian with the Egyptian and Ph\u0153nician mythologies. \u2014 It has been a vain and prepos terous labour of modern mythological writers to attempt to trace all the fables of antiquity, and the various systems of Pagan Theology, up to one common source. \u2014 The absurdity of this is best shown by comparing the different and most contradictory solutions of the same fable given by different mythologists ; as, for example, by Lord Bacon and the Abbe Banier. Some au thors, with much indiscretion, have attempted to deduce all the Pagan mythologies from the Holy Scriptures. \u2014 Such researches are not only un profitable, but positively mischievous."], [71, "SECT. 6. 43 ANCIENT HISTORY. 2. Superstition, in the early periods, was a predominant characteristic of the Greeks. \u2014 To this age, and to this character of the people, we refer the origin of the Grecian oracles, and the institution of the public games in honour of the gods. The desire of penetrating into futurity, and the supers^tion common to rude nations, gave rise to the oracles of Delphi, Dodona, &c. The resort of strangers to these oracles on particular occasions led to the celebration of a festival, andto public games. [The Amphictyonic council had the particular charge and superin tendence of the temple and proceedings at Delphi, and it may be noticed, as redounding to the credit of the oracles, that the maintenance of freedom and good order, and the softening of manners, appear to have been the chief ob jects of their responses.] The four solemn games of the Greeks, par ticularly termed Ispot, were the Olympic, the Pythian, the Nemean, and the Isthmian. They consisted principally in contests of skill in all the athletic exercises, and the prizes were chiefly honorary marks of distinction. \u2014 Archbishop Potter, in his Arch\u0153ologia Gr\u0153ca, fully details their particular nature. \u2014 These games had ex-"], [72, "44 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. cellent political effects, in promoting national union, in diffusing the love of glory, and training the youth to martial exercises. They cherished at once a heroical and a superstitious spirit, which led to the formation of extraordinary and hazardous enterprises. VII. EARLY PERIOD OF THE GRECIAN HISTORY. THE ARGONAUTIC EXPEDITION. WARS OF THEBES AND OF TROY. 1. The history of Greece, for a period of 300 years preceding the Trojan war, is intermixed with fables; but contains, at the same time, many facts entitled to credit, as authentic. Erectheus, or Ericthonius, either a Greek who had visited Egypt, or the leader of a new Egyptian colony, cultivated the plains of Eleu sis, and instituted the Eleusinian mysteries, in imitation of the Egyptian games of Isis. These mysteries were of a religious and moral nature, conveying the doctrines of the unity of God, the immortality of the soul, and a future state of reward and punishment. Cicero speaks of them with high encomium. \u2014 But the ceremo- 14"], [73, "SECT. 7. ANCIENT HISTORY. 45 nies connected with them were childish and ridiculous. 2. Theseus laid the foundation of the gran deur of Attica, by uniting its twelve cities, and giving them a common constitution, 1257 B. C. ; [reserving to himself scarcely any privilege, ex cept that of presiding in the council, and at the celebration ' of sacrifices, and the command in time of war.] 3. The first great enterprise of the Greeks was the Argonautic expedition, 1263 B. C. (Usher), and 937 B. C. (Sir I. Newton). [But the latter computation is now judged to be liable to insurmountable objections.*] This expedition is supposed to have been both a military and a mercantile adventure, and was singularly bold for the times in which it was undertaken. The object was to open the commerce of the Euxine sea, and to secure some establishments on its coasts ; [led thereto probably by the prospect of obtaining in abundance the precious metals.] The astronomer Chiron directed the plan of the voyage, and formed, for the use of the mariners, a scheme of the constellations, fixing with ac curacy the solstitial and equinoctial points. Sir * See Stevenson's Historical Sketch of the Progress of Discovery, Navigation, and Commerce. 1824."], [74, "46 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. Isaac Newton has founded his emendation of the ancient Chronology, on a calculation of the regular procession of the equinoxes from this period to the present, as well as on an estimate of the medium length of human generations.* 4. The state of the military art at this time in Greece may be estimated from an account of the sieges of Thebes and of Troy. In these enterprises the arts of attack and defence were very rude and imperfect. The siege was entirely of the nature of blockade, and therefore necessarily of long duration. \u2014 A dispute for the divided sovereignty of Thebes between the brothers Eteocles and Polynices, gave rise to the war, which was terminated by single combat, in which both were killed. 5. The sons of the commanders slain in this war renewed the quarrel of their fathers, and occasioned the war of the Epigonoi, a subject on which Homer is said to have written a poem, now lost, equal to the Iliad and Odyssey. 6. The detail of the war of Troy rests chiefly on the authority of Homer, and ought not, in spite of modern scepticism, to be refused, in its principal facts, the credit of a true history. \u2014 * See preceding note."], [75, "SECT. 8. 47 ANCIENT HISTORY. After a blockade of ten years, Troy was taken, either by storm or surprise, 1184 B. C, and, being set on fire in the night, was burnt to the ground : not a vestige of its ruins existing at the present day. The empire fell from that moment. The Greeks settled a colony near the spot; and the rest of the kingdom was occupied by the Lydians. 7- Military expeditions at this time were car ried on only in the spring and summer. \u2014 In a tedious siege, the winter was a season of armis tice. \u2014 The science of military tactics was then utterly unknown, every battle being a multitude of single combats. \u2014 The soldier had no pay but his share of the booty, divided by the chiefs. \u2014 The weapons of war were the sword, the bow, the javelin, the club, the hatchet, and the sling. A helmet of brass, an enormous shield, a cuirass, and buskins, were the weapons of defence. VIII. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE GREEK COLONIES. 1. About eighty years after the taking of Troy began the war of the Heraclid\u00e6. Her culus, the son of Amphitryon, sovereign of"], [76, "PART I. 48 ANCIENT HISTORY. Mycen\u00e6, was banished from his country with all his family, while the crown was possessed by an usurper. His descendants, after the period of a century, returned to Peloponnesus, and, subduing all their enemies, took possession of the states of Mycen\u00e6, Argos, and Laced\u00e6mon. 2. A long period of civil war and bloodshed succeeded, and Greece, divided among a num ber of petty tyrants, suffered equally the mise ries of oppression and anarchy. Codrus, King of Athens, [on an irruption of the Heraclid\u00e6 into Attica, and to give a par ticular turn to an oracle,] showed a singular example of patriotism, in devoting himself to death for his country ; yet the Athenians, weary of monarchy, [which had been the settled form of government without interruption for the space of four hundred and eighty-seven years, from Cecrops to Codrus,] determined to make the experiment of a popular constitution. Medon, the son of Codrus, was elected chief magistrate, with the title of Archon ; [at first an office for life, but in course of time subject to many limitations, as will be seen hereafter.] This is the commencement of the Athenian republic, about 1068 B. C. 3. It was at this time that the Greeks began"], [77, "SECT. 8. 49 ANCIENT HISTORY. to colonise. The oppression which they suf fered at home forced many of them to abandon their country, and seek refuge in other lands. \u2014 A large body of \u00c6olians from Peloponnesus founded twelve cities in the Lesser Asia, of which Smyrna was the most considerable. A troop of Ionian exiles built Ephesus, Colophon, Clazomene, and other towns ; giving to their new settlements the name of their native country Ionia. The Dorians sent off colonies to Italy and Sicily, founding, in the former, Tarentum and Locri, and in the latter, Syracuse and Agri gentum. The mother-country considered its colonies as emancipated children. \u2014 These speedily attained to eminence and splendour, rivalling and surpassing their parent states : and the example of their prosperity, which was attributed to the freedom of their governments, incited the states of Greece, oppressed by a number of petty despots, to put an end to the regal government, and try the experiment of a popular constitution. Athens and Thebes gave the first examples, which were soon followed by all the rest. 4. These infant republics demanded new laws ; and it was necessary that some enlight ened citizens should arise, who had discernment VOL. I. E"], [78, "PART I. 50 ANCIENT HISTORY'. to perceive what system of legislation was most adapted to the character of his native state ; who had abilities to compile such a system, and sufficient authority with his countrymen to re commend and enforce it. Such men were the Spartan Lycurgus and the Athenian Solon. IX. THE REPUBLIC OF SPARTA. 1. The origin of this political system has given rise to much ingenious disquisition among the moderns, and affords a remarkable instance of the passion for systematising. It is a prevail ing propensity with modern philosophers to reduce every thing to general principles. Man, say they, is always the same animal, and, when placed in similar situations, will always exhibit a similar appearance. His manners, his im provements, the government and laws under which he lives, arise necessarily from the situa tion in which we find him ; and all is the result of a few general laws of nature which operate universally on the human species. But in the ardour of this passion for generalising, these"], [79, "sect. 9= 51 ANCIENT HISTORY. philosophers often forget, that it is the know ledge of facts which can alone lead to the disco very of general laws : a knowledge not limited to the history of a single age or nation, but ex tended to that of the whole species in every age and climate. Antecedently to such knowledge, all historical system is mere romance. 2. Of this nature is a late theory of the con stitution of Sparta, first started by Mr. Brown in his Essay on Civil Liberty ; and from him adopted by later writers. It thus accounts for the origin of the Spartan constitution. * \" The army of the Heraclid\u00e6, when they came to re \" cover the dominion of their ancestors, was \" composed of Dorians from Thessaly, the most \" barbarous of all the Greek tribes. The \" Ach\u00e6ans, the ancient inhabitants of Laconia, \" were compelled to seek new habitations, \" while the barbarians of Thessaly took posses \u00a5 sion of their country. Of all the nations \" which are the subject of historical record, this \" people bore the nearest resemblance to the \" rude Americans. An American tribe, where \" a chief presides, where the council of the aged \" deliberate, and the assembly of the people \" gives their voice, is on the eve of such a poli- * Logan's Philosophy of History, &c. E 2"], [80, "52 ANCIENT HISTORY*. PART 1. \" tical establishment as the Spartan constitu \" tion,\" The Dorians or Thessalians settled in Laced\u00e6mon, manifested, it is said, the same manners with all other nations in a barbarous state. Lycurgus did no more than arrest them in that state, by forming their usages into laws. He checked them at once in the first stage of their improvement. \" He put forth a bold \" hand to that spring which is in society, and \" stopt its motion.\" 3. This theory, however ingenious, is con futed by facts. All ancient authors agree, that Lycurgus operated a total change on the Spar tan manners, and on the constitution of his country; while the moderns have discovered that he made no change on either. The most striking features of the manners and constitution of Sparta have not the smallest resemblance to those of any rude nations with which we are acquainted. The communion of slaves, and of many other species of property, the right of the state in the children of all the citizens, their common education, the public tables, the equal division of lands, the oath of government be tween the kings and people, have no parallel in the history of any barbarous nations. 4. The real history of Sparta and its consti tution is therefore not to be found in modern"], [81, "SECT. 9- 53 ANCIENT HISTORY. theory, but in the writings of the Greek histo rians, and these are our sole authorities worthy of credit. After the return of the Heraclid\u00e6, Sparta was divided between the two sons of Aristodemus, Eurysthenes, and Procles, who jointly reigned ; and this double monarchy, transmitted to the descendants of each, continued in the separate branches for nearly 900 years. A radical prin ciple of disunion, and consequent anarchy made the want of constitutional laws be severely felt. Lycurgus, brother of Polydectes, one of the kings of Sparta, a man distinguished alike by his abilities and virtues, was invested, by the concurring voice of the sovereigns and people, with the important duty of reforming and new modelling the constitution of his country, 884 B. C. 5. Lycurgus instituted a senate elective, of twenty-eight members ; whose office was to pre serve a just balance between the power of the kings and that of the people. Nothing could come before the assembly of the people which had not received the previous consent of the senate ; and, on the other hand, no judgment of the senate was effectual without the sanction of the people. The kings presided in the senate j e 3"], [82, "54 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. they were the generals of the republic ; but they could plan no enterprise without the consent of a council of the citizens. 6. Lycurgus bent his attention most particu larly to the regulation of manners; and one great principle pervaded^ his whole system ; \u2014 luxury is the bane of society. He divided the territory of the Republic into 39,000 equal portions, among the whole of its free citizens ; [and he seems to have had it in view to keep the population within these precise limits by continual warfare, the establishment of colonies, restraints upon the sale of land, the exposure of infants, and destruction of slaves.] He substituted iron money for gold and silver, prohibited the practice of commerce, abolished all useless arts, and allowed even those neces sary to life to be practised only by the slaves. [Strangers were as much as possible excluded by a particular law, lest they should introduce bad customs, soft manners, or vicious habits.] The whole [of the] citizens, [young and old,] made their principal repast at the public tables. The meals were coarse and parsimonious ; the conversation was fitted to improve the youth in virtue, and cultivate the patriotic spirit, [To ex ercise the judgment, and improve the reasoning"], [83, "SECT. 9- ANCIENT HISTORY. 55 powers, questions were proposed to the young, on points connected either with politics or morals, to which they were expected to give the readiest and most direct replies, in brief and pithy sentences, without any circumvention or superfluity of words ; \u2014 a form of discourse pro verbially named after them, and preserved to this day in the term laconic.'] The Spartan education rejected all embel lishments of the understanding. It nourished only the severer virtues. It taught the duties of religion, obedience to the laws, respect for parents, reverence for old age, inflexible honour, undaunted courage, contempt of danger and of death : \u2014 above all, the love of glory and of their country. 7\u00ab But the general excellence of the institu tions of Lycurgus was impaired by many ble mishes. The manners of the Laced\u00e6monian women were shamefully loose. They frequented the baths, and fought naked in the Pal\u00e6stra pro miscuously with the men, [the ostensible motive being, to strengthen their bodies that they might produce a vigorous and manly offspring.] Theft was a part of Spartan education. The youth were taught to subdue the feelings of humanity ; the slaves were treated with the most barbarous E 4"], [84, "56 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. rigour, and often massacred for sport. The in stitutions of Lycurgus had no other end than to form a nation of hardy soldiers. 8. A faulty part of the constitution of Sparta was the office of the Ephori ; magistrates elected by the people, whose power, though in some respects subordinate, was in others paramount to that of the kings and senate. [They were in number five : their office was annual : in every instance they acted as public censors, and, as might naturally be expected, often very capri ciously ; while the limited period of their office naturally led them, like the consuls at Rome, to engage in some enterprise to distinguish the year of their magistracy, and this impatience and desire to do something, often ended, as might be expected, in some rash and precipitate measure,] X. THE REPUBLIC OF ATHENS. 1. On the abolition of the regal office at Athens, the change of the constitution was more nominal than real. The archonship was, during three centuries, a perpetual and here-"], [85, "SECT. 10. ANCIENT HISTORY. 57 ditary magistracy. In 754 B. C. this office be came decennial. In 648 the archons were an nually elected, and were nine in number, with equal authority. Under all these changes, the state was convulsed, and the condition of the people miserable. 2. Draco, elevated to the archonship 624 B. C, projected a reform in the constitution of his country, and thought to repress disorders by the extreme severity of penal laws. But his talents were unequal to the task he had under taken. [Had his laws prevailed, the character of the people would have been rendered more barbarous than ever ; but, in fact, they were impracticable.] S. Solon, an illustrious Athenian, of the race of Codrus, attained the dignity of archon 594 B. C, and was intrusted with the care of fram ing for his country a new form of government, and a new system of laws. He possessed ex tensive knowledge, but wanted that intrepidity of mind which is necessary to the character of a great statesman. His disposition was mild and temporising; and, without attempting to reform the manners of his countrymen, he ac commodated his system to their prevailing habits and passions. [Had he trusted more to his"], [86, "PART I. 58 ANCIENT HISTORY. own talents for legislating, he might have con ferred much benefit on the state.] 4. The people claimed the sovereign power, and they received it : the rich demanded offices and dignities : the system of Solon accommo dated them to the utmost of their wishes. He divided the citizens into four classes, according to the measure of their wealth. To the three first, the richer citizens, belonged all the offices of the commonwealth. The fourth, the poorer class, more numerous than all the other three, had [a deliberative voice and] an equal right of suffrage with them in the public assembly, where all laws were framed and measures of state decreed. Consequently the weight of the latter decided every question. 5. To regulate in some degree the proceed ings of those assemblies, and balance the weight of the popular interest, Solon instituted a senate of 400 members, (afterwards enlarged to 500, and 600,) with whom it was necessary that every measure should originate before it became the subject of discussion in the assembly of the people. 6. To the court of Areopagus, [which under Draco had lost much of its original weight and importance,] he committed the guardianship of"], [87, "SECT. 10. 59 ANCIENT HISTORY. the laws, and the power of enforcing them, with the supreme administration of justice. To this tribunal belonged likewise the custody of the treasures of the state, the care of religion, and a tutorial power over all the youth of the republic. The number of its judges was various at dif ferent periods, and the most immaculate purity of character was essential to that high office. [They were, according to the laws of Solon, to be entirely chosen from those who had pre viously discharged, with credit and reputation, the duties of archon.] 7. The authority of the senate and Areopagus imposed some check on the popular assemblies ; but as these possessed the ultimate right of de cision, [and an appellant jurisdiction above the senate,] it was always in the power of ambitious demagogues to sv^ay them to the worst of pur poses. Continual factions divided the people, and corruption pervaded every department of the state. The public measures, the result of the interested schemes of individuals, were often equally absurd as they were profligate. Athens often saw her best patriots, the wisest and most virtuous of her citizens, shamefully sacrificed to the most depraved and most abandoned. 8. The particular laws of the Athenian state"], [88, "60 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. are more deserving of encomium than its form of government. The laws relating to debtors were mild and equitable, as were those which regulated the treatment of slaves. \u2014 But the vassalage of women, or their absolute subjection to the control of their nearest relations, ap- proached too near to a state of servitude. The proposer of a law, found on experience impolitic, was liable to punishment ; an enactment appa- rently rigorous, but probably necessary in a po- pular government. [In cases of public commo- tion, every person was bound to take a part, with a view that all who were wise might be brought forward to stem the torrent of popular distraction, and that no secret influence, the most dangerous weapon in all conspiracies, might screen from public notice the prime mover in such disturbances.] 9. One most iniquitous and absurd peculiarity of the Athenian, and some other governments of Greece, was the practice of the Ostracism, a ballot of all the citizens, in which each wrote down [upon a shell (whence the term of Ostracism)'] the name of the person in his opinion most ob noxious to censure; and he who was thus marked out by the greatest number of voices, though unimpeached of any crime, was banished for"], [89, "SECT. 10. 61 ANCIENT HISTORY. ten years from his country. This barbarous and disgraceful institution, ever capable of the grossest abuse, and generally subservient to the worst of purposes, has stained the character of Athens with many flagrant instances of public ingratitude. [The author of it, and the precise period of its commencement, are equally un known.] 10. The manners of the Athenians formed the most striking contrast to those of the Lace d\u00e6monians. The arts were, at Athens, in the highest esteem ; the Laced\u00e6monians despised the arts, and all who cultivated them. [At Athens, nature was outraged by the too free indulgence of every licentious propensity : the Laced\u00e6monians thwarted nature, by checking and obstructing the force and influence of every tender feeling.] At Athens, peace was the natural state of the republic, and the refined en joyment of life the aim of all its subjects : Sparta was entirely a military establishment ; her subjects, when unengaged in war, were to tally unoccupied. Luxury was the character of the Athenian, as frugality of the Spartan. They were equally jealous of their liberty, and equally brave in war. The courage of the Spartan sprung from constitutional ferocity, that of the"], [90, "62 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. Athenian from the principle of honour. [Had the two characters been blended in either state, the consequences would probably have been most beneficial ; manliness and refinement, so far from being opposed to, being admirable cor rectives of each other.] 11. The Spartan government had acquired solidity, while all the rest of Greece was torn by domestic dissensions. \u2014 Athens, a prey to fac tion and civil disorder, surrendered her liberties to Pisistratus, 550 B. C. ; who, after various turns of fortune, established himself firmly in the sovereignty, exercised a splendid and munificent dominion, completely gained the affections of the people, and transmitted a peaceable crown to his sons Hippias and Hipparchus. [Solon, unable to bear the sight of his country's subjec tion, died, at an advanced age, in a state of self banishment] 12. Hermodias and Aristogiton undertook to restore the democracy ; and succeeded in the attempt [against the sons of Pisistratus]. Hippar chus was put to death ; and Hippias, dethroned, solicited a foreign aid to replace him in the so vereignty. Darius, the son of Hystaspes, medi tated at this time the conquest of Greece. Hip pias took advantage of the views of an enemy 14"], [91, "SECT. 11. 63 ANCIENT HISTORY. against his native country, and Greece was now involved in a war with Persia. XL OF THE STATE OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE, AND ITS HISTORY DOWN TO THE WAR WITH GREECE. 1. The first empire of the Assyrians ended under Sardanapalus ; and three monarchies arose from itsruins, Nineveh, Babylon, and the king dom of the Medes. 2. The history of Babylon and of Nineveh is very imperfectly known. The Medes, hitherto independent tribes, were united under a monar chy by Dejoces- His son Phraortes conquered Persia, but was himself vanquished by Nabucho donoser L, king of Assyria, and put to death. Nabuchodonoser II. led the Jews into captivity, took Jerusalem and Tyre, and subdued Egypt. 3. The history of Cyrus is involved in great uncertainty ; nor is it possible to reconcile or apply to one man the different accounts given of him by Herodotus, Ctesias, and Xenophon. Succeeding his father Cambyses in the throne"], [92, "PART I. 64 ANCIENT HISTORY. of Persia, and his uncle Cyaxares in the sove reignty of the Medes, he united these empires, vanquished the Babylonians and Lydians, sub jected the greatest part of the Lesser Asia, and made himself master of Syria and Arabia. 4. He was succeeded by his son Cambyses, distinguished only as a tyrant and a madman. 5. After the death of Cambyses, Darius, the son of Hystaspes, was elected sovereign of Persia, a prince of great enterprise and ambi tion. Unfortunate in a rash expedition against the Scythians, he projected and achieved the conquest of India. Inflated with success, he now meditated an invasion of Greece, and cor dially entered into the views of Hippias, who sought, by his means, to regain the sovereignty of Athens. 6. Government, Manners, Laws, <\u00a7pc. of the Ancient Persians. \u2014 The government of Persia was an absolute monarchy: the will of the sovereign being subject to no control, and his person revered as sacred ; yet the education bestowed by those monarchs on their children was calculated to inspire every valuable quality of a sovereign. The ancient Persians in general bestowed the utmost attention on the education of youth."], [93, "SECT. 11. 65 ANCIENT HISTORY. Children at the age of five were committed to the care of the Magi, for the improvement of their mind and morals. They were trained at the same time to every manly exercise. The sacred books of the Zendavesta promised to every worthy parent the imputed merit and reward of all the good actions of his children. 7. Luxurious as they were in after-times, the early Persians were distinguished for their tem perance, bravery, and virtuous simplicity of manners. They were all trained to the use of arms, and displayed great intrepidity in war [upheld by the confidence so prevalent in the East, that all who died in the field were sure of future happiness]. The custom of the women following their armies to the field, erroneously attributed to effeminacy, was a remnant of bar barous manners [but, as might naturally be expected, it was attended with great incon veniencies]. 8. The kingdom of Persia was divided into several provinces, each under a governor or satrap, who was accountable to the sovereign for the whole of his conduct. The prince, at stated times, visited his provinces in person, correcting all abuses, easing the burdens of the oppressed, and encouraging agriculture and the vol. r. F"], [94, "66 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. practice of the useful arts. [When the sovereign did not personally interpose, a constant com munication with the most distant parts of the empire was carried on by means of couriers, in the manner of our posts. Cyrus has the credit of being the author of this establishment, which was but slowly adopted in the western parts of the world.] The laws of Persia were mild and equitable, and the utmost purity was observed in the administration of justice. 9. The religion of the ancient Persians is of great antiquity. It is conjectured that there were two Zoroasters ; the first the founder of this ancient religion, and of whom are recorded miracles and prophecies ; the second a reformer of that religion, contemporary with Darius the son of Hystaspes. The Zendavesta, or sacred book, compiled by the former, was improved and purified by the latter. It has been lately translated into French by M. Anquetil, and ap pears to contain, amidst a mass of absurdity, some sublime truths, and excellent precepts of morality. The theology of the Zendavesta is founded on the doctrine of two opposite prin ciples, a good and an evil, Ormusd and Ahriman, eternal beings who divide between them the government of the universe, and whose warfare 14"], [95, "67 SECT. 11. ANCIENT HISTORY. must endure till the end of 12,000 years, when the good will finally prevail over the evil. A separation will ensue of the votaries of each : the just shall be admitted to the immediate en joyment of paradise ; the wicked, after a limited purification by fire, shall ultimately be allowed to partake in the blessings of eternity. Ormusd is to be adored through the medium of his greatest works, the sun, moon, and stars. The fire, the symbol of the sun, the air, the earth, the water, have their subordinate worship. The morality of the Zendavesta is best known from its abridgment the Sadder, compiled about three centuries ago by the modern Guebres. It inculcates a chastened species of Epicurism ; allowing a free indulgence of the passions, while consistent with the welfare of society. It pro hibits equally intemperance and ascetic mortifi cation. It recommends, as precepts of religion, the cultivation of the earth, the planting of fruit trees, the destruction of noxious animals, the bringing water to a barren land. 10. Such were the ancient Persians. But their character had undergone a great change before the period of the war with Greece. At this time they were a degenerate and corrupted people. Athens had recently thrown off the f 2"], [96, "PART I. 68 ANCIENT HISTORY. yoke of the Pisistratid\u00e6, and highly valued her new liberty. Sparta, in the ardour of patriot tism, forgot all jealousy of her rival state, and cordially united in the defence of their common country. The Persians, in this contest, had no other advantage than that of numbers, an unequal match for superior heroism and military skill. XII. THE WAR BETWEEN GREECE AND PERSIA. 1. The ambition of Darius the son of Hys^ taspes, heightened by the passion of revenge, gave rise to the project of that monarch for the invasion of Greece. The Athenians [offended by the countenance given by the Persians and Spartans to Hippias, the banished son of Pisis tratus,] had aided the people of Ionia in an attempt to throw off the yoke of Persia, and burnt and ravaged Sardis, the capital of Lydia. Darius speedily reduced the Ionians to submis sion, and then turned his arms against the Greeks, their allies ; the exile Hippias eagerly prompting the expedition. 2. After an insolent demand of submission, which the Greeks scornfully refused, Darius"], [97, "69 SECT. 12. ANCIENT HISTORY. began a hostile attack both by sea and land. The first Persian fleet was wrecked in doubling the promontory of Athos ; a second, of 600 sail, ravaged the Grecian islands ; while an im mense army, landing in Eubcea, poured down with impetuosity on Attica. The Athenians met them on the plain of Marathon, and, headed by Miltiades, [who had nobly proposed that the enemy should be intercepted on its march to Athens, ] defeated them with prodigious slaughter, 490 B. C. The loss of the Persians in this battle was 6300, that of the Athenians 190. 3. The merit of Miltiades, signally displayed in this great battle, was repaid by his country with the most shocking ingratitude. Accused of treason for an unsuccessful attack on the Isle of Paros, his sentence of death was commuted into a fine of fifty talents ; which being unable to pay, he was thrown into prison, and there died of his wounds. 4. The glory of ungrateful Athens was yet nobly sustained in the Persian war by Themistocles and Aristides [though the latter had as much to allege against his countrymen as Miltiades himself]. Darius dying, was succeeded by his son Xerxes, the heir of his father's ambition, but not of his abilities. He armed, as is said, five f 3"], [98, "70 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. millions of men, for the conquest of Greece ; 1200 ships of war, and 3000 ships of burden. Landing in Thessaly, he proceeded, by rapid marches, to Thermopyl\u00e6, a narrow defile on the Sinus Maliacus. The Athenians and Spartans, aided only by the Thespians, Plat\u00e6ans, and \u00c6ginetes, determined to withstand the invader. Leonidas, king of Sparta, was chosen to defend this important pass with 6000 men. Xerxes, aster a weak attempt to corrupt him, imperiously summoned him to lay down his arms. Let him come, said Leonidas, and take them. For two days the Persians in vain strove to force their way, and were repeatedly repulsed with great slaughter. An unguarded track being at length discovered, the defence of the pass became a fruitless attempt on the part of the Greeks. Leonidas, foreseeing certain destruction, com manded all to retire but 300 of his countrymen. His motive was to give the Persians a just idea of the spirit of that foe whom they had to en counter. He, with his brave Spartans, were all cut off to a man, 480 B. C. A monument, erected on the spot, bore this noble inscription, written by Simonides: O stranger, tell it at Laced\u00e6mon, that we died here in obedience to her laws."], [99, "SECT. 12. 71 ANCIENT HISTORY. 5. The Persians poured down upon Attica. The inhabitants of Athens, after conveying their women and children to the islands for security, [on an artful but successful suggestion, of The mistocles, in the interpretation of an oracle,] betook themselves to their fleet, abandoning [with a profusion of tears and lamentations] the city, which the Persians pillaged and burnt. The fleet of the Greeks, consisting of 380 sail, was attacked in the straits of Salamis, by that of the Persians, amounting to 1200 ships. Xerxes himself beheld from an eminence on the coast the total discomfiture of his squadron. He then fled with precipitation across the Hellespont [alarmed by a false report that his bridge of boats was about to be destroyed]. A second overthrow awaited his army by land : for Mar donius, at the head of 300,000 Persians, was totally defeated at Plat\u00e6a by the combined army of the Athenians and Laced\u00e6monians, [under the command of Pausanias,] 479 B. C. On the same day the Greeks engaged and destroyed the remains of the Persian fleet at Mycale. From that day the ambitious schemes of Xerxes were at an end ; and his inglorious life was soon after terminated by assassination. He was suc- f 4"], [100, "72 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I, ceeded in the throne of Persia by his son Ar taxerxes Longimanus, 464 B. C. 6. At this time the national character of the Greeks was at its highest elevation. The com mon danger had annihilated all partial jealousies between the states, and given them union as a nation. But with the cessation of danger those jealousies recommenced. Sparta meanly op posed the rebuilding of deserted Athens. \u2014 Athens, rising again into splendour, saw with pleasure the depopulation of Sparta by an earth quake, and hesitated to give her aid in that juncture of calamity against a rebellion of her slaves. 7. Cimon, the son of Miltiades, after expel ling the Persians from Thrace, attacked and destroyed their fleet on the coast of Pamphylia, and, landing his troops, gained a signal victory over their army the same day. \u2014 Supplanted in the public favour by the arts of his rival Pericles, he suffered a temporary exile ; to return only with higher popularity, [on the motion of Peri cles himself,] and to signalize himself more [than ever] in the service of his ungrateful country, He attacked and totally destroyed the Persian fleet of 300 sail ; and, landing in Cilicia, com-"], [101, "SECT. 12. 73 ANCIENT HISTORY. pleted his triumph, by defeating 300,000 Per sians under Megabyzes, 460 B. C. Artaxerxes now had the prudence to sue for peace, which was granted by the Greeks on terms most ho nourable to the nation. They stipulated for the freedom of all the Grecian cities of Asia, and that the fleets of Persia should not approach their coasts from the Euxine to the extreme boundary of Pamphilia. The last fifty years were the period of the highest glory of the Greeks ; and they owed their prosperity entirely to their union. The peace with Persia dissolv ing that connection, brought back the jealousies between the predominant states, the intestine disorders of each, and the national weakness. 8. The martial and the patriotic spirit began visibly to decline in Athens. An acquaintance with Asia, and an importation of her wealth, introduced a relish for Asiatic manners and luxuries. With the Athenians, however, this luxurious spirit was under the guidance of taste and genius. It led to the cultivation of the finer arts ; and the age of Pericles, though the national glory was in its wane, is the \u00e6ra of the highest internal splendour and magnificence of Greece."], [102, "74 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. XIII. AGE OF PERICLES. I. Republics, equally with monarchies, are generally regulated by a single will : only, in the former, there is a more frequent change of masters. \u2014 Pericles [who by great art had raised himself to the head of affairs] ruled Athens with little less than arbitrary sway ; and Athens pre tended at this time to the command of Greece. She held the allied states in the most absolute subjection, and lavished their subsidies, bestowed for the national defence, in magnificent build ings, games, and festivals, for her own citizens. The tributary states loudly complained, [that what was paid for the defence and benefit of the country at large should be spent in the em bellishment of only one city ; but they] durst not call this domineering republic to account ; and the war of Peloponnesus, dividing the nation into two great parties, bound the lesser cities to the strictest subordination on the predominant powers."], [103, "SECT. 13. 75 ANCIENT HISTORY. 2. The state of Corinth had been included in the last treaty between Athens and Sparta. The Corinthians waging war with the people of Corcyra, an ancient colony of their own, both parties solicited the aid of Athens, who took part with the latter ; a measure which the Co rinthians complained of, not only as an infrac tion of the treaty with Sparta, but as a breach of a general rule of the national policy, that no foreign power should interfere in the disputes between a colony and its parent state. War was proclaimed on this ground between Athens and Laced\u00e6mon, each supported by its respective allies. The detail of the war, which continued for twenty-eight years, with various and alter nate success, is to be found in Thucydides. Pe ricles died before its termination ; a splendid ornament of his country, but reproached as a corrupter of her manners, by fostering the spirit of luxury. [The charge, indeed, cannot perhaps be got over, but it may fairly be observed in vindication of his fame, that the luxury he intro duced was of no common stamp. It was con ducive to the improvement of the public taste, the promotion of the fine arts, and even the encou ragement of science.

Had he been only profuse and not licentious, his ad- ministration might be looked back to as in all respects a truly brilliant \u00e6ra, in the history of the world; and if we cannot clear him of the charge of corrupting the morals of his countrymen, some blame should be thrown on the philosophers his contemporaries, who having the possession of the public ear, to a degree unknown before, should have inculcated principles of a more exalted nature.] Alcibiades ran a career [similar to that of Pericles] with equal talents, equal am- bition, and still less purity of moral principle. In the interval of a truce with Sparta, he incon siderately [and in defiance of much opposition particularly from Nicias,] projected the conquest of Sicily; and failing in the attempt, [as might"], [105, "SECT. 13.

He hesitated not to wreak his ven geance against his country, by selling his services, first to Sparta, and afterwards to Persia. Finally, he purchased his peace with his country, by betraying the power which protected him, and returned to Athens, [which, it must be acknow ledged, had fallen into great difficulties and con fusion in his absence,] the idol of a populace as versatile as worthless. 3. A fatal defeat of the Athenian fleet at \u00c6gos Potamos, by Lysander, reduced Athens to the last extremity ; and the Laced\u00e6monians blockaded the city by land and sea [after a desperate resistance, even under the pressure of famine]. The war was ended by the absolute submission of the Athenians, who agreed to demolish their port, to limit their fleet to twelve ships, and undertake for the future no military enterprise, but under command of the Laced\u00e6 monians, 405 B.C.

It is to the same Lysander, who termi nated the Peloponnesian war so gloriously for Laced\u00e6mon, that history ascribes the first great breach of the constitution of his country, by the introduction of gold into that republic. \u2014 Lysander, after the reduction of Athens, abo lished the popular government in that state, and substituted in its place thirty tyrants, whose power was absolute, [and who exercised that power in so arbitrary and unjust a manner, that] the most eminent of the citizens fled from their country ; but a band of [these fugitive] patriots, [who had been barbarously refused shelter by the Spartans,] headed by Thrasybulus, attacked, van quished, and expelled the usurpers, and once more re-established the democracy. 5. One event which happened at this time reflected more disgrace on the Athenian name than their national humiliation : this was the persecution and death of Socrates, a philosopher who was himself the patron of every virtue which he taught. The sophists, whose futile"], [107, "SECT. 13. 79 ANCIENT HISTORY. logic he derided and exposed, represented him as an enemy to the religion of his country, because, without regard to the popular super stitions, he led the mind to the knowledge of a Supreme Being, the Creator and ruler of the universe, and the belief of a future state of retribution. His defence he made himself with the manly fortitude of conscious innocence; but in vain : his judges were his personal enemies ; and he was condemned to die by poison, 397 B. C. (See Section XXIII. \u00a7 5.) [The Athenians, it is true, soon repented of their error, punished his accusers and their abettors, and did honour to his memory, but too late, as was generally the case with that hasty, fickle, and inconstant people. Not many years aster the death of Socrates, Phocion suffered in the same ignominious man ner ; being barbarously and ungratefully con demned to die, forced to drink the deadly poison, and yet, soon afterwards, honoured with a public statue to commemorate his worth and important services.] 6. On the death of Darius Nothus, his eldest son, Artaxerxes Mnemon, succeeded to the empire of Persia. His younger brother, Cyrus, [commanding in Asia Minor,] formed theproject of dethroning him ; and, with the aid of 13,000"], [108, "PART I. 80 ANCIENT HISTORY. Greeks, [whom Cyrus had seduced to join his army,] engaged him near Babylon ; but was de feated and slain ; a just reward of his most culpable enterprise. The remainder of the Grecian army, to the amount of 10,000, under the command of Xenophon, made a most amaz ing retreat, traversing a hostile country of 1600 miles in extent, from Babylon to the banks of the Euxine [continually attacked, but always victorious, and finally reaching their own country by the Hellespont]. Xenophon has beautifully written the history of this expedition ; but has painted the character of Cyrus in too flattering colours, and without the smallest censure of his criminal ambition. 7- The Greek cities of Asia had taken part with Cyrus. Sparta was engaged to defend her countrymen, and consequently was involved in a war with Persia. Had Athens added her strength, the Greeks might have once more defied the power of Asia ; but jealousy kept the states divided, and even hostile to each other ; and the gold of Artaxerxes excited a general league in Greece against Laced\u00e6mon, Agesi laus, King of Sparta, [who owed his elevation to that dignity entirely to his own merit,] sustained, for a considerable time, the honour of his country,"], [109, "SECT. 14. 81 ANCIENT HISTORY. and won some important battles in Asia ; but others were lost in Greece ; and a naval defeat near Cnidos utterly destroyed the Laced\u00e6monian fleet. Finally, to escape total destruction, the Spartans sued for peace, and obtained it, by the sacrifice to Persia of all the Asiatic colonies, 387 B. C. Artaxerxes further demanded, ob tained, [and secured to] his allies the Athenians, the [possession of the] islands ofScyros, Lemnos, and Imbros. A disgraceful treaty ; a mortify ing picture of the humiliation of the Greeks [and, above all, of the fatal effects of discord, and political rivalry]. XIV. THE REPUBLIC OF THEBES. 1. While Athens and Sparta were thus visibly tending to decline, the Theban Republic emerged from obscurity, and rose for a time to a degree of splendour eclipsing all its cotem porary states. The Republic was divided by faction, one party supporting its ancient demo cracy, and the other aiming at the establishment of an oligarchy. The latter courted the aid of the Spartans, who embraced that occasion to VOL. I. G"], [110, "82 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. take possession of the citadel [in a manner by no means honourable]. Four hundred of the exiled Thebans fled for protection to Athens. Among these wasPelopidas, [a man of family and wealth, brave and enterprising,] who planned and ac complished the deliverance of his country. Dis guising himself and twelve of his friends as peasants, he entered Thebes in the evening, and joining a patriotic party of the citizens, they surprised the heads of the usurpation amid the tumult of a feast, and put them all to death. Epaminondas, the friend of Pelopidas, [but a man of very different habits, in moderate circum stances, and much given to study, yet brave and generous,] shared with him in the glory of this enterprise ; and attacking, with the aid of 5000 Athenians, the Laced\u00e6monian garrison, drove them entirely out of the Theban territory. 2. A war necessarily ensued between Thebes and Sparta, in which the former had the aid of Athens. This, however, was but for a season. Thebes singly opposed the power of Sparta, and the league of Greece ; but Epaminondas and Pelopidas were her generals. The latter, amidst a career of glory, perished in an expedition against the tyrant of Pher\u00e6a. Epaminondas, triumphant at Leuctra and Mantinea, fell in"], [111, "SECT. 15. 83 ANCIENT HISTORY. that last engagement, and with him expired the glory of his country, 363 B. C. Athens and Sparta were humbled at the battle of Mantinea. Thebes was victorious ; but she was undone by the death of Epaminondas. All parties were tired of the war ; and Artaxerxes, more power ful among those infatuated states than in his own dominions, dictated the terms of the treaty. It was stipulated, that each power should retain what it possessed ; and that the lesser states, now free from the yoke of the greater, should remain so. XV. PHILIP OF MACEDON. 1. Greece was now in the most abject situa tion : the spirit of patriotism appeared utterly extinct, and military glory at an end. Athens seemed to have lost all ambition : the pleasures of luxury had entirely supplanted heroic virtue : poets, musicians, sculptors, and comedians, were now the only great men of Attica. Sparta, no less changed from the simplicity of her ancient manners, and her power abridged by the new g 2"], [112, "84 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. independency of the states of Peloponnesus, was in no capacity to attempt a recovery of her former greatness. In this situation, [so favour able to the attempts of any person of genius and enterprise,] Philip of Macedon formed the am bitious project of bringing under his dominion the whole of Greece [having been delivered up by his father as an hostage to the Thebans, he had had an opportunity of learning the art of war under'Epaminondas]. 2. He had mounted the throne of Macedon [at an early age, and] by popular choice, in vio lation of the natural right of the nearer heirs to the crown ; and he secured his power by the success of his arms against the Illyrians, P\u00e6o nians, and Athenians, who espoused the interest of his competitors. Uniting to great military talents the most consummate artifice and ad dress, [and having great revenues at his com mand, from the mines of Macedonia, and Thrace,] he had his pensionaries in all the states of Greece, who directed to his advantage every public measure; [he knew how to proceed with caution, and to wait for favourable events.] The miserable policy of the Grecian states, embroiled in per petual quarrels, co-operated with his designs [$nd Athens itself had degenerated so far as to"], [113, "85 SECT. 15. ANCIENT HISTORY. have become a prey to corruption]. A sacrile gious attempt of the Phocians to plunder the tem ple of Delphos [under circumstances, however, of no small provocation,] excited the Sacred War, in which almost all the republics took a part ; and Philip's aid being courted by the Thebans and Thessalians, he began hostilities by invad ing Phocis, the key to the territory of Attica. \u00c6schines the orator, bribed to his interest, at tempted to quiet the alarms of the Athenians, by ascribing to Philip a design only of punishing sacrilege and vindicating the cause of Apollo. Demosthenes, with true patriotism, exposed the artful designs of the invader, and with the most animated eloquence roused his countrymen to a vigorous effort for the preservation of the na tional liberties. But the event was unsuccess ful. The battle of Cheron\u00e6a, fought 3S7 B. C, decided the fate of Greece, and subjected all her states to the dominion of the King of Ma cedon. But it was not his policy to treat them as a conquered people. They retained their separate and independent governments, while he controlled and directed all the national mea sures. [To which rule and authority nothing contributed more than his being chosen, on the dispossession of the Phocians, head of the Am- g 3"], [114, "86 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. phictyonic council.] Convoking a general coun cil of the states, Philip was appointed comman der-in-chief of the forces of Greece ; and he laid before them his project for the conquest of Persia, appointing each republic to furnish its proportional subsidies. On the eve of this great enterprise, [while celebrating the nuptials of his daughter Cleopatra,] Philip was assassinated by Pausanias, a captain of his guards, in revenge of a private injury, 336 B. C. The Athenians, on the death of Philip, meanly expressed the most tumultuous joy, in the hope of a recovery of their liberty [Demosthenes himself descending so low, as to propose giving a crown to the assassin] ; but this visionary prospect was never realised. The spirit of the nation was gone ; and in their subsequent revolutions they only changed their masters. XVI. ALEXANDER THE GREAT. 1. Alexander, the son of Philip, succeeded, at the age of twenty, to the throne of Macedon, and, after a few successful battles against the"], [115, "SECT. 16. 87 ANCIENT HISTORY. revolted states, to the command of Greece. [He had profited by his education under Aristotle, as well as by the instructions he received from his father, so that he was in all respects a most accomplished prince, having a great genius both for politics and war ; well versed in philosophy, and much addicted to letters.] Assembling the deputies of the nation at Corinth, he commu nicated to them his resolution of prosecuting the designs of his father for the conquest of Persia. 2. With an army of 30,000 foot, and 5000 horse, the sum of 70 talents, and provisions only for a single month, he crossed the Hellespont, and, in traversing Phrygia, visited the tomb of Achilles. Darius Codomannus, resolved to crush at once this inconsiderate youth, met him on the banks of the Granicus with 100,000 foot and 10,000 horse. The Greeks swam the river, their king leading the van, and attacking the as tonished Persians, left 20,000 dead upon the field, and put to flight their whole army. Draw ing from his first success a presage of continued victory, Alexander now sent home his fleet, leaving to his army the sole alternative, that they must subdue Asia or perish. Prosecuting their course for some time without resistance, the g 4"], [116, "88 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. Greeks were attacked by the Persians in a nar row valley of Cilicia, near the town of Issus. The Persian host amounted to 400,000 ; but [numbers could not compensate the want of order and discipline, and] their situation being such that only a small part could come into action, they were defeated with prodigious slaughter. The loss of the Persians in this battle was 1 10,000, that of the Greeks (according to Q. Curtius) only 450. 3. The history of Alexander by Quintius Cur tius, though a most elegant composition, is ex tremely suspicious on the score of authentic information. Arrian is the best authority. [Be sides an excellent judgment displayed in the composition of his history, he seems to have en joyed the advantage of deriving his information from those who were well able to furnish him with the facts, such as they really were.] 4. The generosity of Alexander was displayed after the battle of Issus, in his attention to his noble prisoners, the mother, the wife and family of Darius. To the credit of Alexander, it must be owned that humanity, however overpowered, and at times extinguished by his passions, cer tainly formed a part of his natural character. 5. The consequence of the battle of Issus was"], [117, "SECT. 16. 89 ANCIENT HISTORY. the submission of all Syria. Damascus where, Darius had deposited his chief treasures, was be trayed and given up by its governor. The Ph\u0153nicians were pleased to see themselves thus avenged for the oppression they had suffered un der the yoke of Persia. 6. Alexander had hitherto borne his good fortune with moderation : Felix, says Curtius, si hoc continentia ad ultimum vit\u0153 perseverare po tuisset; sed nondum Fortuna se animo ejus infu derat. [Being desirous, as it has been supposed, of keeping up his communication with the sea, in consequence of some intelligence he had pick ed up at Damascus,] he directed his course to wards Tyre, and desired admittance to perform a sacrifice to Hercules. The Tyrians shut their gates, and maintained for seven months a noble defence. The city was at length taken by storm ; and the victor glutted his revenge by the inhuman massacre of 8000 of the inhabitants. The fate of Gaza, gloriously defended by B\u00e6tis, was equally deplorable to its citizens, and more disgraceful to the conqueror. Ten thousand of the former were sold into slavery, and its brave defender dragged at the wheels of the victor's chariot : Glorianie rege, Achillem, a quo genus"], [118, "PART 1. 90 ANCIENT HISTORY. ipse deduceret, imitatum se esse, p\u0153na in hostem capienda. Curt. 7. The taking of Gaza opened Egypt to Alex ander, and the whole country submitted without opposition. Amidst the most incredible fa tigues, he now led his army through the deserts of Lybia, to visit the temple of his father Jupiter Ammon. On his return he built Alexandria, at the mouth of the Nile, afterwards the capital of the Lower Egypt, and one of the most flourish ing cities in the world. Twenty other cities of the same name were reared by him in the course of his conquests. It is such works as these that justly entitle the Macedonian to the epithet of Great. By rearing in the midst of deserts those nurseries of population and of industry, he re paired the waste and havoc of his conquests. But for those monuments of his glory, he would have merited no other epithet than that assigned him by the Brahmins of India, The mighty Murderer. 8. Returning from Egypt, Alexander traversed Assyria, and was met at Arbela by Darius, at the head of 700,000 men. The Persian had proffered peace, consenting to yield the whole country from the Euphrates to the Hellespont, to give Alexander his daughter in marriage, and"], [119, "SECT. 16. 91 ANCIENT HISTORY. the immense sum of 10,000 talents. But these terms were haughtily rejected, and peace refused but upon the unqualified submission of his enemy. The Persians were defeated at Arbela, with the loss of 300,000 men. Darius fled from province to province. At length, betrayed by Bessus, one of his own satraps, he was cruelly murdered ; and the Persian empire, which had subsisted for 206 years from the time of Cyrus the Great, submitted to the conqueror, 330 B. C. 9. Alexander now projected the conquest of India, firmly persuaded that the gods had de creed him the sovereignty of the whole habitable globe. He penetrated to the Ganges, and would have advanced to the Eastern Ocean, had the spirit of his army kept pace with his ambition. But his troops seeing no end to their toils, re fused to proceed. He returned to the Indus, from whence, sending round his fleet to the Per sian Gulf under Nearchus, he marched his army across the desert to Persepolis. 10. Indignant that he had found a limit to his conquests, he abandoned himself to every excess of luxury and debauchery. The arrogance of his nature, and the ardour of his passions, height ened by continual intemperance, broke out into the most outrageous excesses of cruelty, for which, in the few intervals of sober reflection,"], [120, "PART I. 92 ANCIENT HISTORY. his ingenuous mind suffered the keenest remorse. From Persepolis he returned to Babylon, and there died in a fit of debauch, in the thirty-third year of his age, and thirteenth of his reign, 324 B.C. 11. Of the character of Alexander the most opposite and contradictory estimates have been formed. While by some he is esteemed nothing better than a fortunate madman, he is by others celebrated for the grandeur, wisdom, and solid ity of his political views. Truth is rarely to be found in extreme censure or applause. We may allow to Alexander the spirit and the talents of a great military genius, without combining with these the sober plans of a profound politician. In a moral view of his character, we see an ex cellent and ingenuous nature corrupted at length by an unvarying current of success, and a strik ing example of the fatal violence of the passions, when eminence of fortune removes all restraint, and flattery stimulates to their uncontrouled in dulgence. [12. Some circumstances, however, seem clearly to prove, that though the termination of his ex pedition was highly disgraceful to him, he was, at the commencement of it, as desirous of acquiring the fame of being the patron of learning and of the"], [121, "SECT. 16. ANCIENT HISTORY. 93 arts, as of passing for the conqueror of the world : he had always persons in his suite, particularly qualified to examine the interior of the countries he visited, as well as their coasts, cities, rivers, &c. All the rare and uncommon animals he met with were carefully transmitted to his pre ceptor, Aristotle. And the books and writings found at Tyre and Babylon, with many curious astronomical and hydrostatical observations, be ing removed to Alexandria, were the means of laying open to the Greeks the knowledge and learning of the Ph\u0153nicians and Chaldeans. The voyage of Nearchus, indeed, already spoken of, appears to have been expressly designed for a voyage of discovery and observation, conducive to the establishment of a more direct trade be tween India and Alexander's European dominions. So that, all things considered, it seems but fair to conclude, leaving out of the question the mad excesses at Persepolis, which clouded and ob scured the latter days of his short life, that the real character of Alexander as has been well ob served, \" would be much raised in the opinion of men of humanity, and philosophers, if the particulars we possess of his endeavours to im prove the condition of those he conquered, and to advance the interests of science, scanty and"], [122, "94 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. imperfect as they are, were more attentively considered, and had not been neglected and overlooked in the glare of his military achieve ments.\"] XVII. SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER. 1. Alexander, on his death-bed, named no successor, but gave his ring to Perdiccas, one of his officers. When his courtiers asked him to whom he wished the empire to devolve upon his death, he replied, \" To the most worthy ;\" and he is said to have added, that he foresaw this le gacy would prepare for him very extraordinary funeral rites ; a prediction which was fully veri fied. 2. Perdiccas, sensible that his pretensions would not justify a direct assumption of the go vernment of this vast empire, brought about a division of the whole among thirty-three of the principal officers ; and trusting to their inevita ble dissensions, he proposed by that means to reduce all of them under his own authority. Hence arose a series of wars and intrigues, of"], [123, "SECT. 17- 95 ANCIENT HISTORY. which the detail is barren both of amusement and useful information. It is sufficient to say, that their consequence was a total extirpation of the family of Alexander, and a new partition of the empire into four great monarchies, the shares of Ptolemy, Lysimachus, Cassander, and Seleu cus: of these the most powerful were, that of Syria under Seleucus and his descendants ; and that of Egypt under the Ptolemies. [The latter were decidedly the most worthy successors of the Macedonian conqueror, in carrying into execu tion his plans for the extension of commerce and navigation, promoting science, and conferring glory on his own city of Alexandria, the rival of Tyre, and, during the long space of eighteen centuries, the emporium or channel of mercantile communication between India and Europe.] \" We cannot (says Condillac) fix our atten \" tion on the history of the successors of Alex \" ander, though a great theatre is opened to \" our view, a variety of scenes, and multiplied \" catastrophes. A picture is often displeasing \" from the very circumstance of its greatness. \" We lose the connection of its parts, because \" the eye cannot take them in at once. Still \" less will a large picture give us pleasure, if \" every part of it presents a different scene,"], [124, "96 ANCIENT HISTORY PART I. \" each unconnected with the other.\" Such is the history of the successors of Alexander. XVIIL FALL AND CONQUEST OF GREECE. 1. Nor is the history of Greece from the period of the death of Alexander any longer an interesting or pleasing object of contemplation. Demosthenes once more made a noble attempt to vindicate the national freedom and to rouse his countrymen, the Athenians, to shake off the yoke of Macedon. But it was too late. The pacific counsels of Phocion suited better the languid spirit of this once illustrious people. 2. The history of the different republics pre sent from this time nothing but a disgusting series of uninteresting revolutions ; with the exception only of that last effort made by the Ach\u00e6an states to revive the expiring liberty of their country. The republic of Achaia was a league of a few of the smaller states to vin dicate their freedom against the domineering spirit of the greater. They committed the go vernment of the league to Aratus of Sicypn,"], [125, "SECT. 18. 97 ANCIENT HISTORY. with the title of Pr\u00e6tor, a young man of high ambition, who immediately conceived the more extensive project of rescuing the whole of Greece from the dominion of Macedon. But the jealousy of the greater states rendered this scheme abortive. Sparta refused to range her self under the guidance of the Pr\u00e6tor of Achaiaj and Aratus, forgetting his patriotic designs, sought only now to wreck his vengeance against the Laced\u00e6monians. For this purpose, with; the most inconsistent policy, he courted the aid; even of the Macedonians ; the very tyrants whQ> had enslaved his country. 3. The period was now come for the inteiv vention of a foreign power, which was to reduce all under its wide-spreading dominion. The Romans were at this time the most powerful of all the contemporary nations. The people of \u00c6toli, attacked by the Macedonians, with a rash policy, besought the aid of the Romans,. who, eager to add to their dominion this de voted country, cheerfully obeyed the summons, and speedily accomplished the reduction of Ma cedonia. Perseus, its last sovereign, was led. captive to Rome, and graced the triumph of Paulus \u00c6milius, 167 B. C. From that period, the Romans were hastily advancing to the do- VOL. I. H"], [126, "98 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. minion of all Greece ; a progress in which their art was more conspicuous than their virtue. They gained their end by fostering dissensions between the states, which they directed to their own advantage ; corrupting their principal ci tizens, and using, in fine, every art of the most insidious .policy. A pretext was only wanting to unsheath the sword ; and this was furnished by the Achaean states, who insulted the depu ties of imperial Rome. This drew on them at once the thunder of the Roman arms : Metellus marched his legions into Greeqe, gave them battle, and entirely defeated them. Mummius the consul terminated the work, and made an easy conquest of the whole of Greece, which from that period became a Roman province, under the name of Achaia, 146 B. C. 4. Rome had acquired from her conquests a flood of wealth, and began now to manifest a taste for luxury, and a spirit of refinement. In these points Greece was to her conquerors an instructor and a model : Gr\u00e6cia capta serum victorem cepit, et artes Intulit agresti Latio. Hence, even though vanquished, she was regarded with a species of respect by her ruder masters."], [127, "SECT. 19. ANCIENT HISTORY. 99 XIX. POLITICAL REFLECTIONS ARISING FROM THE HIS- TORY OF THE STATES OF GREECE. 1. The revolutions which .the states of Greece underwent, and the situations into which they were thrown by their connection and differences with each other, and their wars with foreign nations, were so various, that their history is a school of instruction in political science. The surest test of the truth or falsehood of abstract principles of politics is their application to actual experience and to the history of nations. 2. The oppression which the states of Gxeece suffered under their ancient despots, who were subject to no constitutional control, was a most justifiable motive for their establishing a new form of government, which promised them Abe enjoyment of greater political freedom. We be lieve, too, that those new forms of government were framed by their virtuous legislators in the true spirit of patriotism. But as to the real me rits of those political fabrics, it is certain that they were very far from corresponding in prac- h 2"], [128, "100 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. tice with what was expected from them in theory. We seek in vain, either in the history of Athens or Laced\u00e6mon, for the beautiful idea of a well ordered commonwealth. The revolutions of go- vernment which they were ever experiencing, the eternal factions with which they were em- broiled, plainly demonstrate that there was a ra- dical defect in the structure of the machine, which precluded the possibility of regular motion. The condition of the people under those govern- ments was such as partook more of servitude and oppression than that of the subjects of the most despotic monarchies. The slaves formed the actual majority of the inhabitants in all the states of Greece. To these, the free citizens were rigor- ous bond-masters ; and bondage being a conse- quence of the contraction of debts even by a free man, a great proportion even of these were subject to the tyrannical control of their fellow- citizens. Nor were their richer classes in the actual enjoyment of independence. They were perpetually divided into factions, which servilely ranked themselves under the banners of the con tending chiefs of the republic. Those parties were kept together solely by corruption. The whole was, therefore, a system of servility and debasement of spirit, which left nothing of a"], [129, "SECT. 19. 101 ANCIENT HISTORY. free or ingenuous nature in the condition of indi viduals, nor any thing that could furnish enco mium to a real advocate for the dignity of hu man nature. Such was the condition of the chief republics of antiquity. Their governments promised in theory, what they never conferred in practice, the political happiness of the citizens. 3. \" In democracy (says Dr. Fergusson) men \" must love equality ; they must respect the \" rights of their fellow-citizens ; they must be \" satisfied with that degree of consideration they \" can procure by their abilities fairly measured \" against those of an opponent ; they must la \" bour for the public without hope of profit ; \" they must reject every attempt to create a \" personal dependence.\" \u2014 This is the picture of a republic in theory. If we reverse this pic ture in every single particular, and take its direct opposite, we shall have the true portrait of a re publican government in practice. 4. It is the fundamental theory of Montes quieu's Spirit of Laws, that the three distinct forms of government, the monarchical, despo tical, and republican, are influenced by the three separate principles of honour, fear, and virtue; and this theory is the foundation on h 3"], [130, "ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. 102 which the author builds a great part of his poli tical doctrines. That each of these principles is exclusively essential to its respective form of government, but unnecessary and even preju dicial in the others, is a position contrary both to reason and to truth. No form of government can subsist where every one of those principles has not its operation. The admission of such a theory leads to the most mischievous conclu sions ; as, for example, that in monarchies the state dispenses with virtue in its officers and magistrates ; that public employments ought to be venal ; and that crimes, if kept secret, are of no eonsequence. 5. It is only in the infant periods of the Grecian history, that We are to look for those splendid examples of patriotism and heroic virtue, which the ardent mind of uncorrupted youth will ever delight to contemplate. The most remarkable circumstance which strikes us on comparing the latter with the more early periods of the history of the Greeks, is the total change in the genius and spirit of the people. The ardour of patriotism, the thirst of military glory, the enthusiasm of liberty, decline with the rising grandeur and opulence of the nation : and an enthusiasm succeeds of another species,"], [131, "S.ECT. 20. ANCIENT HISTORY. 103 and far less worthy in its aim ; an admiration of the fine arts, a violent passion for the objects of taste, and for the refinements of luxury. \u2014 This leads us to consider Greece in the light in which, after the loss of her liberty, she still continued to attract the admiration of other nations. XX. STATE OF THE ARTS IN GREECE. 1. It is not among the Greeks that we are to look for the greatest improvements in the useful and necessary arts of life. In agriculture, manu factures, commerce, they never were greatly dis tinguished. [For their corn they were chiefly indebted to foreign countries ; Sicily, Egypt, and the Crimea. Corinth seems to have abounded most in manufactures, particularly those of brass, (or that curious compound metal so called and named after the city,) coverlets for beds, and earthen- ware ; the latter, for the most part, taste fully ornamented. Corinth was, also, the great mart for foreign commerce ; their importations, in exchange for the manufactures above men tioned, consisting chiefly of paper and sail-cloth H 4"], [132, "104 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. from Egypt ; ivory from Lybia ; leather from Cyrene; incense from Syria; dates from Ph\u0153nicia; carpets from Carthage ; and fruit from Eub\u0153a. Much of their traffic was carried on at their fairs, which took place commonly at the time of their public games and assemblies, all hostilities being suspended on those occasions, so as to allow merchants and others to pass with safety.] But, [if the Greeks depended much on others for the supply of their necessities,] in what are termed the Fine Arts, they surpassed all the contemporary nations ; and the monuments of these which yet remain are the models of imit ation, and the confessed standard of excellence, in the judgment of the most polished nations of modern times. 2. Aster the defeat of Xerxes, the active spirit of the Athenians, which would have otherwise languished for want of an object, taking a new direction from luxury, displayed itself signally in all the works of taste in the fine arts. The administration of Pericles was the \u00e6ra of luxury and splendour. The arts broke out at once with surprising lustre, and architecture, sculp ture, and painting, were carried to the summit of perfection. This golden age of the arts in"], [133, "SECT. 20. 105 ANCIENT HISTORY. Greece endured for about a century, till aster the death of Alexander the Great. 3. The Greeks were the parents of that system of architecture which is universally allowed to be the most perfect. The Greek architecture consisted of three distinct orders ; the Doric, the Ionic, and Corinthian. The Doric has a masculine grandeur, and a superior air of strength to both the others. It is, therefore, best adapted to works of great magnitude and of a sublime character. The character of sublimity is essentially connected with chasteness and simplicity. Of this order is the temple of Theseus at Athens, built ten years after the battle of Marathon, and at this day almost entire. The Ionic order is light and elegant. The former has a masculine grandeur ; the latter a feminine elegance. The Ionic is likewise simple j for simplicity is an essential requisite in true beauty. Of this order were the temple of Apollo at Miletus, that of the Delphic oracle, and the temple of Diana at Ephesus. The Corinthian marks an age of luxury and magnificence, when pomp and splendour had become the predominant passion, but had not"], [134, "106 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. yet extinguished the taste for the sublime and beautiful. It attempts, therefore, an union of all these characters, but satisfies not the chast ened judgment, and pleases only a corrupted taste. \" First unadorned, \" And nobly plain, the manly Doric rose ; \" The Ionic then, with decent matron grace, \" Her airy pillar heav'd ; luxuriant last \" The rich Corinthian spread her wanton wreath.\" Thomson'* Liberty, part 2. 4. The Tuscan and the Composite orders are of Italian origin. The Etruscan architecture appears to be nearly allied to the Grecian, but to possess an inferior degree of elegance. The Trajan column at Rome is of this order ; less remarkable for the beauty of its proportions than for the admirable sculpture which deco rates it. \u2014 The Composite order is what its name implies : it shows that the Greeks had in the three original orders exhausted all the prin ciples of grandeur and beauty ; and that it was not possible to frame a fourth, but by combining the former. 5. The Gothic architecture offers no contra diction to these observations. The effect which it produces cannot be altogether accounted for from the rules of symmetry or harmony in the"], [135, "SECT. SO. ANCIENT HISTORY. 107 proportions between the several parts ; but de pends on a certain idea of vastness, gloominess, and solemnity, which are powerful ingredients in the sublime. 6. Sculpture was brought by the Greeks to as high perfection as architecture. The remains of Grecian sculpture are at this day the most perfect models of the art ; and the modern artists have no means of attaining to excellence so certain as the study of those great master pieces. 7. The excellence of the Greeks in sculpture may, perhaps, be accounted for chiefly from their having the human figure often before their eyes quite naked, and in all its various attitudes, both in the Pal\u00e6stra and in their public games. The antique statues have, therefore, a grandeur united with perfect simplicity, because the atti tude is not the result of an artificial disposition of the figure, as in the modern academies, but is nature unconstrained. Thus, in the Dying Gladiator, when we observe the relaxation of the muscles, and the visible failure of strength and life, we cannot doubt that nature was the sculptor's immediate model of imitation. * * Cresilas vulneratum dtficientem fecit, ex quo possit Intel ligi quantum restet animi. Pun. lib. 36."], [136, "108 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. 8. And this nature was in reality superior to what we now see in the ordinary race of men. The constant practice of gymnastic exercises gave a finer conformation of body than what is now to be found in the vitiated pupils of mo dern effeminacy, the artificial children of mo dern fashion. 9. A secondary cause of the eminence of the Greeks in the arts of design was their theology, which furnished an ample exercise for the ge nius of the sculptor and painter. 10. We must speak with more diffidence of the ability of the Greeks in painting, than we do of their superiority in sculpture ; because the existing specimens of the former are very few, and the pieces which are preserved are probably not the most excellent. But in the want of actual evidence, we have every presumption that the Greeks had attained to equal perfection in the art of painting and in sculpture : for if we find the judgment given by ancient writers of their excellence in sculpture confirmed by the universal assent of the best critics among the moderns, we have just reason to presume an equal rectitude in the judgment which the same ancient writers have pronounced upon their paintings. If Pliny is right in his opinion"], [137, "SECT. 20. ANCIENT HISTORY. 109 of the merits of those statues which yet remain, the Venus of Praxiteles, and the Laocoon of Agesander, Polydorus, and Athenodorus, we have no reason to suppose his taste to be less just, when he celebrates the merits, and critically characterises the different manners of Zeuxis, Apelles, Parrhasius, Protogenes, and Timanthes, whose works have perished. 11. The paintings found in Herculaneum, Pompeii, the Sepulchrum Nasonianum at Rome, were probably the work of Greek artists ; for the Romans were never eminent in any of the arts dependent on design. These paintings ex hibit great knowledge of proportions, and of the chiaro-oscuro ; but betray an ignorance of the rules of perspective. 12. The music of the ancients appears to have been very greatly inferior to that of the moderns [which is the more surprising, because they seem to have had much sensibility, and to have been capable of such strong excite ment from the powers of harmony, as to have rendered music an object of the particular atten tion of their legislators, statesmen, and philo sophers]. 13. The peculiar genius of the Greeks in the fine arts extended its effects to the revolutions"], [138, "PA*T I, 110 ANCIENT HISTORY. of their states, and influenced their fate as a nation. XXI. OF THE GREEK POETS. 1. The Greeks were the first who reduced the athletic exercises to a system, and consi dered them as an object of general attention and importance. The Panathen\u00e6an, and aster wards the Olympic, the Pythian, Nem\u00e6an, and Isthmian games, were under the regulation of the laws. They contributed essentially to the improvement of the nation ; and, while they cherished martial ardour, and promoted hardi ness and agility of body, cultivated likewise urbanity and politeness. 2. The games of Greece were not confined to gymnastic or athletic exercises. They en couraged competitions in genius and learning. They were the resort of the poets, the historians, and the philosophers. 3. In all nations poetry is of greater antiquity than prose-composition [sentiment and imagin ation having the start of reason, as faculties of"], [139, "SECT. 21. 111 ANCIENT HISTORY. the human mind]. The earliest prose-writers in Greece, Pherecydes of Scyros, and Cadmus of Miletus, were 350 years posterior to Homer. Any remains of the more ancient poets, as Linus, Orpheus, &c, are extremely suspicious. Homer is generally supposed to haye flourished about 907 B. C. ; to have followed the occupa tion of a wandering minstrel, and to have com posed his poems in detached fragments, and separate ballads, and episodes. [Lycurgus is said to have first brought them into Greece, but] Pisistratus, about 540 B. C. first em ployed learned men to collect and methodise these fragments ; and to this we owe the com plete poems of the Iliad and Odyssey. [A more perfect edition was prepared by Aristotle for his pupil Alexander, to which the learned world may also probably be much indebted. The Macedonian prince is reported to have esteemed them so highly, as to have kept them in a golden casket, under his pillow, when he slept.] The distinguishing merits of Homer are, his profound knowledge of human nature, his faithful and minute description of ancient manners, his ge nius for the sublime and beautiful, and the har mony of his poetical numbers [a fine moral sentiment breathes throughout the whole]. His"], [140, "112 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. fidelity as an historian has been questioned ; but the great outlines of his narrative are probably authentic. [The extreme accuracy of his state ments in many particulars was acknowledged to be such, that different states have been known to refer to his works, to settle disputes about ter ritory, and ascertain their rights of dominion.] 4. Hesiod was nearly contemporary with Ho mer ; a poet, of whose merits we should be little sensible, were they not seen through the me dium of an immense antiquity. The poem of the Works and Days contains some judicious precepts of agriculture. The Theogony is an obscure history of the origin of the gods, and the formation of the universe. 5. About two centuries after Homer and Hesiod, flourished Archilochus, the inventor of Iambic verse ; Terpander, equally eminent as a poet and a musician ; Sappho, of whose compo sition we have two exquisite odes ; Alc\u00e6us and Simonides, of whom there are some fine frag ments ; and Pindar and Anacreon, who have left enough to allow an accurate estimate of their merits. 6. Pindar was esteemed by the ancients the chief of the lyric poets. He possesses unbounded fancy and great sublimity of imagery ; but his"], [141, "SECT. 21. 113 ANCIENT HISTORY. digressions are so rapid and so frequent, that we cannot discover the chain of thought ; and his expression is allowed, even by Longinus, to be often obscure and unintelligible. [In ge neral, however, it must be admitted that his precepts are just and noble, and his sentiments pure.] 7. Anacreon is a great contrast to Pindar. His fancy suggests only familiar and luxurious pictures. He has no comprehension of the sublime, but contents himself with the easy, the graceful, and the wanton. His morality is loose, and his sentiments little else than the effusions of a voluptuary. 8. The collection termed Anthologia, which consists chiefly of ancient epigrams, contains many valuable specimens of the taste and poe tical fancy of the Greeks, and contributes ma terially to the illustration of their manners. The best of the modern epigrams may be traced to this source. 9. The \u00e6ra of the origin of dramatic com position among the Greeks is about 590 B. C. Thespis was contemporary with Solon. Within little more than a century the Greek drama was carried to its highest perfection ; for \u00c6schylus died 456 B. C. \u00c6schylus wrote sixty-six tra- vol. 1. 1"], [142, "114 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. gedies [some, indeed, make them amount to ninety, the titles of which have been collected by Fabricius]. For thirteen he gained the first prize of dramatic poetry at the Olympic games. Only seven are now extant. Like Shakspeare, his genius is sublime, and his imagination un bounded [terror seems to have been the chief end of all his pieces]. He disdained regularity of plan, and all artificial restriction ; but unfor tunately he disdained likewise the restraints of decency and of good morals. 10. Sophocles and Euripides flourished about fifty years after \u00c6schylus. Euripides is most masterly in painting the passion of love both in its tenderest emotions and in its most violent paroxysms ; yet the characters of his women demonstrate that he had no great opinion of the virtues of the sex [and Sophocles, indeed, com paring Euripides with himself, lets us into the secret, that the latter described them, not as they should be, but as they were]. Longinus does not rate high his talent for the sublime ; but he possessed a much superior excellence ; his verses, with great eloquence and harmony, breathe the most admirable morality. There re main [only nineteen] tragedies of Euripides"], [143, "SECT. 21. ANCIENT HISTORY. 115 [out of nearly a hundred] ; of these the Medea is deemed the most excellent. 11. Sophocles shared with Euripides the palm of dramatic poetry ; and is judged to have sur passed him in the grand and sublime. Of 120 tragedies which he composed, only seven remain. They display great knowledge of the human heart, and a general chastity and simplicity of expression, which give the greater force to the occasional strokes of the sublime. The \u0152di pus of Sophocles is esteemed the most perfect production of the Greek stage. 12. The Greek comedy is divided into the ancient, the middle, and the new. The first was a licentious satire and mimicry of real personages exhibited by name upon the stage. The laws repressed this extreme license, and gave birth to the middle comedy, which continued the sati rical delineation of real persons, but under fic titious names. The last improvement consisted in banishing all personal satire, and confining comedy to a delineation of manners. This was the new comedy. Of the first species, the an cient, we have no remains. The dramas of Aris tophanes are an example of the second or middle comedy. The grossness of his raillery, and the malevolence which frequently inspired it, are a i 2"], [144, "116 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. reproach to the morals of that people which could tolerate it, [and derogate greatly from the credit they might, otherwise, have acquired from the better taste of their tragedians. The plays of Aristophanes, nevertheless,] have their value, as throwing light upon ancient manners. 13. Of the new comedy Menander was the bright example ; possessing a vein of the most delicate wit, with the utmost purity of moral sentiment. Unfortunately we have nothing of him remaining but a few fragments preserved by Athen\u00e6us. We see a great deal of his merits, however, in his copyist and translator Terence. 14. The actors, both in the Greek and Roman theatres, wore masks, of which the features were strongly painted, and the mouth so constructed as to increase the power of the voice. \u2014 It is probable the tragedy and comedy of the Greeks and Romans were set to music, and sung like the recitative in the Italian opera ; and some times one person was employed to recite or sing the part, and another to perform the correspond ing action or gesticulation. 15. The Mimes were burlesque parodies on the serious tragedy and comedy. The Panto mimes consisted solely of gesticulation, and were carried to great perfection."], [145, "SECT. 22. ANCIENT HISTORY. 117 XXIL OF THE GREEK HISTORIANS. 1. The most eminent of the Greek historians were contemporaries. Herodotus died 413 B. C.j Thucydides, 391 B. C. ; and Xenophon was about twenty years younger than Thucydi des. Herodotus writes the joint history of the Greeks and Persians from the time of Cyrus to the battles of Plat\u00e6a and Mycale. He treats incidently likewise of the Egyptians, Assyrians, Medes, and Lydians. His veracity is to be de pended on in all matters that fell under his own observation ; but he admits too easily the reports of others, and is in general fond of the marvel lous. [He displays much learning in his ac count of Grecian affairs, and an ardent love of his country, but as he read his work to a large assembly whom he wished to please, he may, without violating the truth, have suppressed what might have been disagreeable to his audi ence.] His style is pure, and he has a eopious elocution. 2. Thucydides, himself an able general, has 1 3"], [146, "118 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. written with great ability the history of the first twenty-one years of the Peloponnesian war ; in troducing it with a short narrative of the preced ing periods of the history of Greece. He is justly esteemed for his fidelity and candour. His style is a contrast to the full and flowing period of Herodotus, possessing a sententious brevity, which is at once lively and energetic. [He is often, indeed, as must be admitted, harsh and obscure, but when his meaning is discovered, it is always found to be important and instruc tive: he constantly writes like a statesman.] The history of the remaining six years of the war of Peloponnesus was written by Theopompus and Xenophon. 3. Xenophon commanded the Greek army in the service of Cyrus the younger, in his culpable enterprise against his brother Artaxerxes. (See Sect. XIII. % 6.) After the failure of this en terprise, Xenophon directed that astonishing retreat from Babylon to the Euxine, of which he has given an interesting and faithful nar rative. He wrote likewise the Cyropedia, or the history of the elder Cyrus, which is believed to be rather an imaginary delineation of an ac complished prince than a real narration. He continued the history of Thucydides, and has"], [147, "SECT. 22. 119 ANCIENT HISTORY. left two excellent political tracts on the consti tutions of Laced\u00e6mon and Athens. His style is simple and energetic, familiar, unadorned, and free from all affectation. [A fine strain of moral feeling pervades all his writings : he was a disciple of Socrates, and fellow-pupil of Plato : his attachment to his master was most amiable and exemplary; he vindicated his fame,; defended him in a most affecting and interesting apology, and transmitted his sentiments and discourses to posterity with impressive effect.] 4. Greece, in her decline, produced some historians of great eminence. Polybius, a native of Megalopolis [in Arcadia], wrote forty books of the Roman and Greek history during his own age ; that is, from the beginning of the second Punic war to the reduction of Macedonia into a Roman province ; [treating of the Ach\u00e6an league, the Macedonian, Syrian, Egyptian, Cap padocian, and Persian empires ;] but of this great work only the first five books are entire, with an epitome of the following twelve. He merits less the. praise of eloquence and purity than of authentic information, [great impartia lity,] and most judicious reflection. 5. Diodorus Siculus flourished in the time of Augustus, and composed, in forty books, a i 4"], [148, "PART 1. 120 ANCIENT HISTORY. general history of the world, under the title of Bibliotheca Historica [embracing a period from the reign of Ogyges, King of B\u0153otia, to his own time]. No more remain than fifteen books ; of which the first five treat of the fabulous periods, and the history of the Egyptians, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, &c. prior to the Trojan war. The next five are wanting. The remainder bring down the history from the expedition of Xerxes into Greece till after the death of Alexander the Great. He is taxed with chro nological inaccuracy in the earlier parts of his work; but the authenticity and correctness of the latter periods are unimpeached. 6, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, eminent both as a historian and rhetorician, flourished in the age of Augustus. His Roman Antiquities contain much valuable information, though his work is a good deal tinctured with the spirit of systematising [and in general his writings betray too much of the orator. 7. Strabo, a native of Crete, lived also in the time of Augustus and of his successor Tiberius. We derive from him much curious information relating to the state and circumstances of the ancient world; and in all that he was capable of ascertaining by personal observation, he is"], [149, "SECT. 22. ANCIENT HISTORY. 121 remarkably accurate : he presents to us regular details of the institutes, policy, manners, and religion of the several countries he visited, par ticularly of the territory of Judea. His travels extended to Egypt, Ethiopia, Greece, Italy, and Sardinia.] 8. Plutarch, a native of Cheronea, in B\u0153otia, flourished in the reign of Nero. His Lives of Illustrious Men is one of the most valuable of the literary works of the ancients ; intro ducing us to an acquaintance with the private character and manners of those eminent persons whose public achievements are recorded by pro fessed historians. His morality is excellent ; [though his writings, as might be expected, are sometimes sullied with the impurities of heathenism ;] his style, though not eloquent, is clear and energetic. 9. Arrian wrote, in the reign of Adrian, seven books of the wars of Alexander, with great judgment and fidelity ; his narrative being com posed on the authority of Aristobulus and Ptolemy, two of Alexander's principal officers. [A History of India, also by the same author, is still extant, and a work on military tactics.] His style is unadorned, but chaste, perspicuous, and manly. [Arrian was a native of Nicomedia,"], [150, "122 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. and a disciple of Epictetus. He enjoyed the confidence of the Emperor Adrian to so high a degree as to be appointed by him governor of Cappadocia, when that province was in arms. Antoninus Pius admired his writings, and is sup posed to have learned from him much of the doctrines of Epictetus.] XXIII. OF THE GREEK PHILOSOPHERS. 1. After the time of Homer and Hesiod, the increasing relish for poetical composition gave rise to a set of men termed Rhapsodists, whose employment was to recite at the games and festivals the composition of the older poets, and to comment on their merits and explain their doctrines. Some of these founding schools of instruction were dignified by their pupils with the epithet of Sophists, or teachers of wisdom. 2. The most ancient school of philosophy was that founded by Thales, 640 B. C, and termed the Ionic. Thales is celebrated for his knowledge both in geometry and astronomy. His metaphysical doctrines are but imperfectly known. He taught the belief of a First Cause,"], [151, "SECT. 23. ANCIENT HISTORY. 123 and an over-ruling Providence ; but supposed the Divinity to animate the universe, as the soul does the body. The moral doctrines of the Ionic school were pure and rational. The most eminent of the disciples of Thales were Anaxi mander and Anaxagoras. 3. Soon after the Ionic, arose the Italian sect, founded by Pythagoras, who was born about 586 B. C. He is supposed to have derived much of his knowledge from Egypt ; and he had, like the Egyptian priests, a public doctrine for the people, and a private for his disciples : the former a good system of morals, the latter pro bably unintelligible mystery. His notions of the Divinity were akin to those of Thales ; but he believed in the eternity of the universe, and its co-existence with the Deity. He taught the transmigration of the soul through different bodies. His disciples lived in common ; they abstained rigorously from the flesh of animals ; they held music in high estimation, as a cor rective of the passions. Pythagoras believed the earth to be a sphere, the planets to be inhabited, and the fixed stars to be the suns and centres of other systems. His most eminent followers were Empedocles, Epicharmus, Ocellus Lucanus, Tim\u00e6us, Archytas."], [152, "124 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. 4. The Eleatic sect was founded by Xeno phanes, about 500 B. C. Its chief supporters were Parmenides, Zeno, and Leucippus, citizens of Elea. The metaphysical notions of this sect were utterly unintelligible. They maintained, that things had neither beginning, end, nor any change ; and that all the changes we perceive are in our own senses. Yet Leucippus taught the doctrine of atoms, from whence he supposed all material substances to be formed. Of this sect were Democritus and Heraclitus. 5. The Socratic school arose from the Ionic. Socrates died 401 B. C, the wisest, the most virtuous of the Greeks. He exploded the futile logic of the Sophists, which consisted of a set of general arguments applicable to all manner of questions, and by which they could, with an ap pearance of plausibility, maintain either side of any proposition. Socrates always brought his antagonist to particulars ; beginning with a simple and undeniable position, which being granted, another followed equally undeniable, till the dis putant was conducted, step by step, by his own concessions, to that side of the question on which lay the truth. His rivals lost all credit as philo sophers, but had influence to procure the de struction of the man who had exposed them."], [153, "SECT. 23. ANCIENT HISTORY. 125 The doctrines of Socrates are to be learned from Plato and Xenophon. He taught the belief of a First Cause, whose beneficence is equal to his power, the Creator and Ruler of the universe. He inculcated the moral agency of man, the immortality of the soul, and a future state of reward and punishment. He exploded the Poly theistic superstitions of his country, and thence became the victim of an accusation of impiety. (See Section XIII. \u00a7 5.) 6. The morality of Socrates was successfully cultivated by the Cyrenaic sect, but was pushed the length of extravagance by the Cynics. Virtue, in their opinion, consisted in renouncing all the conveniences of life. They clothed them selves in rags, slept and eat in the streets, or wandered about the country with a stick and a knapsack. They condemned all knowledge as useless. They associated impudence with ignor ance, and indulged themselves in scurrility and invective without restraint. 7. The Megarean sect was the happy inventor of logical syllogism, or the art of quibbling. 8. The Academic sect had Plato for its founder ; a philosopher whose doctrines have had a more extensive empire over the minds of mankind than those of any other among the"], [154, "126 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. ancients. This is in part owing to their intrinsic merit, and in part to the eloquence with which they have been propounded. Plato had the most sublime ideas of the Divinity, and his at tributes [drawn, probably, from Hebrew sources during his sojournment among the Ph\u0153nicians]. He taught that the human soul was a portion of the Divinity, and that this alliance with the Eternal Mind might be improved into actual intercourse with the Supreme Being, by ab stracting the soul from all the corruptions it derives from the body ; a doctrine highly flat tering to the pride of man, and generating that mystical enthusiasm which has the most powerful empire over a warm imagination. 9. The Platonic philosophy found its chief op ponents in four remarkable sects, the Peripatetic, the Sceptic, the Stoic, and the Epicurean. 10. Aristotle, the founder of the Peripatetic sect, was the tutor of Alexander the Great, and established his school in the Lyceum at Athens; a philosopher, whose tenets have found more zealous partisans, and more rancorous oppo nents, than those of any other. His Metaphy sics, from the sententious brevity of his expres sion, are extremely obscure, and have given rise to numberless commentaries. The best analysis"], [155, "SECT. 23. 127 ANCIENT HISTORY. of his logic is given by Dr. Reid, in Lord Kames's Sketches of the History of Man. His physical works are the result of great observ ation and acquaintance with nature ; and his critical writings, as his Poetics and Art of Rhe toric, display both taste and judgment. It is the latter works that will ever continue to be most valued. The peculiar passion of Aristotle was that of classifying, arranging, and combin ing the objects of his knowledge so as to reduce all to a few principles ; a dangerous propensity in philosophy, and repressive of improvement in science. 11. The Sceptical sect was founded by Pyrrho. They formed no systems of their own, but endeavoured to weaken the foundations of those of all others. They inculcated universal doubt as the onlv true wisdom. There was, in their opinion, no essential difference between vice and virtue, farther than as human compact had discriminated them. Tranquillity of mind they supposed to be the state of the greatest happiness, and this was to be attained by abso lute indifference to all dogmas or opinions. 12. The Stoics [the followers of Zeno], pro posing to themselves the same end, tranquillity of mind, took a nobler path to arrive at it."], [156, "128 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. They endeavoured to raise themselves above all the passions and feelings of humanity. They believed all nature, and God himself the soul of the universe, to be regulated by fixed and im mutable laws. The human soul being a portion of the Divinity, man cannot complain of being actuated by that necessity which actuates the Divinity himself. His pains and his pleasures are determined by the same laws which deter mine his existence. Virtue consists in accom modating the disposition of the mind to the immutable laws of nature; vice in opposing those laws : vice, therefore, is folly, and virtue the only true wisdom. A beautiful picture of the Stoical philosophy is found in the Enchiri dion of Epictetus, and in the Meditations of M. Aurelius Antoninus. [But theirs seems to have been a moderated Stoicism, founded much more on the principles of resignation than on pride or apathy ; too much of which is ap parent in the tenets of the older branches of the sect. J 13. Epicurus taught that man's supreme hap piness consisted in pleasure. He himself limited the term so as to make it mean only the prac tice of virtue. But if pleasure is allowed to be the object, every man will draw it from those 5"], [157, "SECT. 24. 129 ANCIENT HISTORY. sources which he finds can best supply it. It might have been the pleasure of Epicurus to be chaste and temperate. We are told it was so ; but others find their pleasure in intemperance and luxury ; and such was the taste of his prin cipal followers. Epicurus held that the Deity was indifferent to all the actions of man. They therefore had no other counsellor than their own conscience, and no other guide than the in stinctive desire of their own happiness. 14. The Greek philosophy, on the whole, affords little else than a picture of the imbecility and caprice of the human mind. Its teachers, instead of experiment and observation, satisfied themselves with constructing theories; and these, wanting fact for their basis, have only served to perplex the understanding, and retard equally the advancement of sound morality and the pro gress of useful knowledge.

ANCIENT HISTORY. ing object of attention ; and the history of this empire, in its progress to universal dominion, and afterwards in its decline and fall, involves a collateral account of all the other nations of antiquity which in those periods are deserving of our consideration. 2. Although we cannot conjecture witn cer tainty as to the \u00e6ra when Italy was first peopled, we have every reason to believe that it was in habited by a refined and cultivated nation many ages before the Roman name was known. These were the Etruscans, of whom there exist at this day monuments in the fine arts, which prove them to have been a splendid, luxurious, and highly polished people. Their alphabet re sembling the Ph\u0153nician, disposes us to believe them of eastern origin. [Both Greek and Latin writers agree in considering them to have come from Lydia, conducted into Italy by Tyrrhenus, son of Atys, King of Lydia, in the time of a great famine, from whom the adjoining sea had its name of Tyrrhenian.] The Roman histo rians mention them as a powerful and opulent nation long before the origin of Rome, Tusco rum ante Romanum imperium late terra marique opes patuere, liv. v. 33. ; and Dionysius of Ha licarnassus deduces most of the religious rites"], [159, "SECT. 24. ANCIENT HISTORY. 131 of the Romans from Etruria. [They are said, indeed, to have been called Tuscans, from the Greek \u00aeua>, denoting their great skill in sacrifi cial ceremonies, in which, as well as in all kinds of augury, they were particularly experienced.] 3. The rest of Italy was divided among a number of independent tribes or nations, com paratively in a rude and uncultivated state ; Umbrians, Ligurians, Sabines, Veientes, Latins, \u00c6qui, Volsci, &c. [But the Etruscans and La tins are the only two nations in Italy of whom we find any thing material recorded before the foundation of Rome.] Latium, a territory of fifty miles in length and sixteen in breadth, contained forty-seven independent cities of states. 4. The origin of the city and state of Rome is involved in great uncertainty. Dionysius supposes two cities of that name to have existed, and to have perished before the foundation of the city built by Romulus. The vulgar account of the latter is, that it was founded 752 B. C. by a troop of shepherds or banditti, who peopled their new city by carrying off the wives and daughters of their neighbours the Sabines. 5. The great outlines of the first constitution of the Roman government, though generally K 2"], [160, "PART I. 132 ANCIENT HISTORY. attributed to the political abilities of Romulus, seem to have a natural foundation in the usages of barbarous nations. Other institutions bear the traces of political skill and positive enact ment. 6. Romulus is said to have divided his peo ple into three tribes, and each tribe into ten cu rice. The lands he distributed into three por tions ; one for the support of the government, another for the maintenance of religion, and the third he divided into equal portions of two acres to each Roman citizen. He instituted a senate of 100 members, (afterwards increased to 200,) who deliberated on and prepared all public measures for the assembly of the people, in whom was vested the right of determination. The Patrician families were the descendants of those centum patres. J. The king had the nominaiion of the sena tors, the privilege of assembling the people, and a right of appeal in all questions of importance. He had the command of the army, and the office of Pontifex Maximus. He had, as a guard, twelve lictors, and a troop of horsemen named Celeres or Equites, afterwards the distinct order of Roman- knights. These regulations are of"], [161, "SECT. 24. ANCIENT HISTORY. 133 positive institution : others arose naturally from the state of society. 8. The patria potestas is of the latter nature, being common to all barbarous tribes. [In the first ages of the Republic, this obtained to an unreasonable extent, but it ought to be added, was seldom abused.] \u2014 The limitation of all arts to the slaves arose from the constant employ ment of the citizens in warfare or in agricul ture. 9. The connection of patron and client; was an admirable institution which at once united the [different classes of] citizens, and maintained an useful subordination. 10. The Sabines were the most formidable enemy of the early Romans ; and a wise policy united for a while the two nations into one state. After the death of Romulus, who reigned thirty seven years, Numa, a Sabine, was elected king. His disposition was pious and pacific, and he en deavoured to give his people the same character. He pretended to divine inspiration, in order to give the greater authority to his laws, which in themselves were excellent. He multiplied the national gods ; [introducing such, particularly, as might best lead the people to a knowledge and practice of the first duties of society ; as the Dii k 3"], [162, "134 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. Termini, presiding over boundaries, whereby the rights of property were t rendered sacred and in- violable ; to which we may justly add his Bona Fides, to whom he caused altars to be erected, and who being set forth as the avenger of all breaches of vows, promises, oaths, and engage- ments, as well public as private, gave a great security to treaties, and became a salutary check upon those who might be disposed, especially in their private dealings, and contracts, to act deceitfully or fraudulently;] he built temples, and instituted different classes of priests, Flami- nes, Salii, &c, and a variety of religious ceremo- nies. The Flamines officiated each in the ser- vice of a particular deity ; the Salii guarded the sacred bucklers ; the Vestals cherished the sacred fire ; the Augurs and Aruspices divined future events from the flight of birds and the entrails of victims [and were permitted, in a very ex- traordinary manner, to interfere with the civil go- vernment, even so far as to annul laws, dissolve the public assemblies, and displace magistrates]. The temple of Janus was open in war, and shut during peace. \u2014 Numa reformed the kalendar, regulating the year at twelve lunar months, and distinguished the days for civil occupation (Fasti) from those dedicated to religious rest (Nefasti)."], [163, "SECT. 24. ANCIENT HISTORY. 135 Agriculture was lawful on the latter, as a duty of religion. Numa reigned forty-three years. 11. Tullus Hostilius, the third king of Rome, of warlike disposition, subdued the Albans, Fi denates, and other neighbouring states. The Sabines, now disunited from the Romans, were among the most powerful of their enemies. Tul lus reigned thirty-three years. 12. Ancus Martius, the grandson of Numa, was elected king on the death of Tullus. He inherited the piety and virtues of his grandfa ther, and joined to these the talents of a warrior- He increased the population of Rome by natu ralising some of the conquered states ; enlarged and fortified the city, and built the port of Ostia at the mouth of the Tiber. He reigned glori ously twenty-four years. 13. Tarquinius Priscus, [the son of] a citizen [and merchant] of Corinth, popular from his wealth and liberality, was elected to the vacant throne. He enlarged the senate by 100 new members from the Plebeian families, Patres mi norum gentium. This body consisted now of 300, at which number it remained for some centuries. Tarquin was victorious in his wars, and he adorned and improved the city with works of utility and magnificence. Such were k 4"], [164, "136 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. the Circus or Hippodrome [after the manner of the Greeks] ; the walls of hewn stone ; the Ca pitol [which indeed he only lived to begin] ; the Cloac\u00e6, those immense common sewers, which lead to the belief that the new Rome had been built on the ruins of an ancient city of greater magnitude. Tarquinius was assassinated [at the instigation of the sons of Ancus Mar tius] in the thirty-eighth year of his reign. 14. Servius Tullius, who had married the daughter of Tarquinius, secured by his own ad dress, and the intrigues of his mother-in-law, his election to the vacant throne. He courted popularity by acts of munificence ; discharging the debts of the poor, dividing among the citi zens his patrimonial lands, improving the city with useful edifices, and extending its bounda ries. The new arrangement which he introduced in the division of the Roman citizens is a proof of much political ability, and merits attention, as on it depended many of the revolutions of the Republic. 15. From the time that the Romans had ad mitted the Albans and Sabines to the rights of citizens, the Urban and Rustic tribes were com posed of those three nations. Each tribe being divided into ten curi\u0153, and every curia having"], [165, "SECT. 24. 137 ANCIENT HISTORY. an equal vote in the comitia, as each individual had in his tribe, all questions were decided by the majority of suffrages. There was no pre eminence between the curi\u0153, and the order in which they gave their votes was determined by lot. This was a reasonable constitution, so long as the fortunes of the citizens were nearly on a par ; but, when riches came to be unequally di vided, it was obvious that much inconvenience must have arisen from this equal partition of power, as the rich could easily by bribery com mand the suffrages of the poor. Besides, all the taxes had hitherto been levied by the head, without any regard to the inequality of fortunes. These \"obvious defects furnished to Servius a just pretext for an entire change of system. His plan was to remove the poorer citizens from all share of the government ; while the burdens attending its support should fall solely on the rich. 16. All the citizens were required, under a heavy penalty, to declare upon oath their names, dwellings, number of their children, and amount of their fortune. After this numeration or cen sus, Servius divided the whole citizens, without distinction, into four tribes, named, from the quarters where they dwelt, the Palatine, Su-"], [166, "138 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. burran, Collatine, and Esquiline. Besides this local division, Servius distributed the whole people into six classes, and each class into se veral centuries or portions of citizens, so called, not as actually consisting of an hundred, but as being obliged to furnish and maintain 100 men in time of war. In the first class, which con sisted of the richest citizens, or those who were worth at least 100 mince*, there were no less than ninety-eight centuries. In the second class (those worth 75 min\u00e6) there were twenty two centuries. In the third (those worth 50 min\u00e6) were twenty centuries. In the fourth (those worth 25 min\u00e6) twenty-two centuries. In the fifth (those worth 12 min\u00e6) thirty cen turies. The sixth, the most numerous of the whole, comprehending all the poorer citizens, furnished only one century. Thus the whole Roman people were divided into 193 centuries, or portions of citizens, so called, as furnishing each an hundred soldiers. The sixth class was declared exempt from all taxes. The other classes, according to the number of centuries of which they consisted, were rated for the public burdens at so much for each century. [And * About 300*. sterling."], [167, "SECT. 24. 139 ANCIENT HISTORY. thus, when an army or a large supply of money was wanted for a war, each century furnished its quota both of men and money ; so that the first class, which contained more centuries, though fewer men, than all the others together, supplied more men, and more money, than the whole Roman state besides ; and by the same means the Roman armies were brought to con sist, for the most part, of the richer citizens of Rome, who, having lands and effects of their own to defend, fought with more resolution, and were the best able to support the expenses of a campaign, j 17. The poor had no reason to complain of this arrangement; but something was wanting to compensate the rich for the burdens to which they were subjected. For this purpose Servius enacted, that henceforth the Comitia should give their votes by centuries ; the first class, consisting of ninety-eight centuries, always voting first. Thus, although the whole people were called to the Comitia, and all seemed to have an equal suffrage, yet, in reality, the richer classes determined every question, the suffrage of the poor being merely nominal : for as the whole people formed 193 centuries, and the first and second classes contained 120 of these, if"], [168, "140 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. they were unanimous, which generally happened in questions of importance, a majority was se cured. Thus in the Comitia Centuriata, in which the chief magistrates were elected, peace and war decreed, and all other important business discussed, the richer classes of the citizens had the sole authority, the votes of the poor being of no avail. And such was the ingenuity of this policy, that all were pleased with it : the rich paid their taxes with cheerfulness, as the price of their power ; and the poor gladly exchanged authority for immunities. The census, per formed every five years, was closed by a lustrum, or expiatory sacrifice ; and hence that period of time was called a Lustrum. [Even in this Servius evinced much wisdom, policy, and feeling ; duly and properly considering, that in the compass of five years there might be great alterations in the fortunes of private persons, so as to make it rea sonable not only to raise some to a higher class, but to reduce others to a lower and less burden some situation.] 18. Servius was assassinated, after a reign of forty-four years, by his infamous daughter Tul lia, married to Tarquinius, the grandson of Pris cus, who thus paved the way for his own eleva tion to the throne. The government of Tarquin,"], [169, "SECT. 24. 141 ANCIENT HISTORY. surnamed the Proud, was systematically tyran nical. He ingratiated himself with the lower orders, to abase by their means the power of the higher ; but insolent, rapacious, and cruel, he finally disgusted all ranks of his subjects. A rape, committed by his son Sextus on Lucretia, the wife of Collatinus, who, unable to survive her dishonour, stabbed herself in presence of her husband and kindred, roused their vengeance, and procured, by their influence with their coun trymen, the expulsion of the tyrant, and the utter abolition of the regal dignity at Rome, 509 B. C. 19. Reflections on the Government and State of Rome during the Period of the Kings. \u2014 The whole structure of the constitution of the Romans under the monarchy has been by most authors erroneously attributed exclusively to the abilities of Romulus, a youth of eighteen, the leader of a troop of shepherds or banditti. This chimerical idea we owe to Dionysius of Halicarnassus. The truth is, the Roman government, like almost every other, was the gradual result of circumstances ; the fruit of time, and of political emergency. 20. The constitution of the Roman senate has occasioned considerable research, and is not"], [170, "142 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. free from obscurity. It is probable that the kings had the sole right of naming the senators, that the consuls succeeded them in this right, and afterwards, when these magistrates found too much occupation from the frequent wars in which the state was engaged, that privilege de- volved on the censors. The senators were at first always chosen from the body of the Patri- cians, but afterwards the Plebeians acquired an equal title to that dignity. In the earlier pe- riods of the Republic, the people could not be assembled but by the senate's authority ; nor were the plebiscita of any weight till confirmed by their decree. Hence the early constitution of the Republic was rather aristocratical than democratical. From this extensive power of the senate, the first diminution was made by the creation of the Tribunes of the people ; and other retrenchments successively took place, till the people acquired at length the predominant power in the state. Yet the senate, even after every usurpation on their authority, continued to have, in many points, a supremacy. They regulated all matters regarding religion ; they had the custody of the public treasure ; they superintended the conduct of all magistrates ; they gave audience to ambassadors, decided on"], [171, "SECT. 24. 143 ANCIENT HISTORY. the fate of vanquished nations, disposed of the governments of the provinces, and took cogni sance, by appeal, in all crimes against the state. In great emergencies they appointed a Dictator with absolute authority. 21. At the period of the abolition of the regal government, the territory of the Romans was extremely limited. The only use they made of their victories was to naturalise the inhabitants of some of the conquered states, and so increase their population. Thus their strength being always superior to their enterprises, they laid a solid foundation for the future extension of their empire. 22. In the accounts given by historians of the strength of the armies, both of the Romans in those early times, and of the neighbouring states their enemies, we have every reason to believe there is much exaggeration. The territories from which those armies were furnished were inca pable of supplying them. 23. In the continual wars in which the re public was engaged, the Romans were most commonly the aggressors. The causes of this seem to have been the ambition of the consuls to distinguish their short administration by some splendid enterprise, and the wish of the senate"], [172, "144 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. to give the people occupation, to prevent in testine disquiets. 24. The regal government subsisted 244 years, and in that time only seven kings reigned, several of whom died a violent death. These circum stances throw doubt on the authenticity of this period of the Roman history. It is allowed that, for the five first centuries after the building of Rome, there were no historians. The first is Fabius Pictor, who lived during the second Punic war. Livy says that almost all the ancient records were destroyed when Rome was taken by the Gauls. XXV. ROME UNDER THE CONSULS. 1. The regal government being abolished, it was agreed to commit the supreme authority to two magistrates, who should be annually elected by the people from the Patrician order! To these they gave the name of Consules ; \" a \" modest title, (says Vertot,) which gave to \" understand that they were rather the counsel \" lors of the Republic than ita sovereigns ; and \" that the only point they ougp to have in view"], [173, "SECT. 25. 145 ANCIENT HISTORY. \u00ab' was its preservation and glory.\" But, in fact, their authority differed scarcely in any thing from that of the kings. They had the supreme administration of justice, the disposal of the public money, the power of convoking the se nate, and assembling the people, raising armies, naming all the officers, and the right of making peace and war. The only difference was, that their authority was limited to a year [but as they were chosen exclusively from the Patrician order, the power of the latter was augmented at the hazard of the people's liberty]. 2. The first consuls were Collatinus, the husband of Lucretia [and Brutus the voluntary avenger of her wrongs. He had affected idiotcy, to avoid the evils that had befallen his father and brother, who were murdered by order of Tarquin; but having been roused to throw off the mask, nothing less would satisfy him than the utter expulsion of the tyrant and his family]. Tarquin was at this time in Etruria, where he got two of the most powerful cities, Veii and Tarquinii, to espouse his cause. He had likewise his par tisans at Rome ; and a plot was formed to open the gates to receive him. It was detected;- and Brutus had the mortification to find his two sons in the number of the conspirators. He con- VOL. I. L"], [174, "146 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. demned them to be beheaded in his presence ; Exidt patrem utconsulem ageret ; orbusque vivere, quampublic\u00e6 vindict\u0153 deesse maluit. Val. Max. 3. The consul Valerius, successful in an engagement with the exiled Tarquin, [in which his colleague Brutus fell by the hand of Aruns, Tarquin's son,] was the first Roman who enjoyed the splendid reward of a triumph. Arrogant from his recent honours, his popularity began to decline ; and in the view of recovering it, he proposed the law, termed, from him, the Valerian, which \" permitted any citizen who \" had been condemned to death by a magistrate, \" or even to banishment or scourging, to appeal \" to the people, and required their consent pre \" viously to the execution of the sentence.\" This law gave the first blow to the aristocracy in the constitution of the Roman republic. [And to render the change more striking and manifest to the people, he caused the axe to be separated from the rods borne before the consuls by the lictors, that it might be seen at once that the power of punishment had passed from the con suls to the people at large ; but it was soon re stored.] 4. For thirteen years after the expulsion of Tarquin the Romans were involved in continual"], [175, "SECT. 25. ANCIENT HISTORY. 147 wars on his account. Of these the most remark able was that with the Etrurians under Porsena ; a war fertile in exploits of romantic heroism. 5. Soon after this period began those domestic disorders, which continued long to embroil the republic. Great complaints had arisen among the poorer classes of the citizens, both on ac count of the inequality of property from the partial distribution of the conquered lands, which the higher ranks generally contrived to engross to themselves, and from the harsh policy by which it was in the power of creditors to reduce to a state of slavery their insolvent debtors. As there was no legal restraint on usury, the poor, when once reduced to the necessity of contract ing debts, were left entirely at the mercy of their creditors [slavery, corporal punishment, con fiscation of lands, were continually resorted to, to enforce payment]. These grievances, felt in common by a large proportion of the citizens, excited much discontent, which, from complaints long disregarded, grew at length into a spirit of determined resistance. The wars required new levies ; and the plebeians positively refused^ to enrol their names, unless the senate should put an end to their oppression, by decreeing at once an abolition of all the debts due by the poor to l 2"], [176, "148 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. the rich. The emergency was critical, as the enemy was at the gates of Rome. The consuls found their authority of no avail ; for the Valerian law had given any citizen condemned by them a right of appeal to the people. An extraordinary measure was necessary, and a Dictator was created for the first time ; a magistrate, who, for the period of six months, was invested with absolute and unlimited authority [the func- tions of all the other magistrates being pro tem pore suspended]. Lartius, nominated to this high office, armed the twenty-four lictors with axes, summoned the whole people to the Comitia, and calling over the names, under the penalty of death to any citizen who should dare to murmur, enrolled all such as he judged most fit for the service of their country. This expedient became henceforward a frequent and certain resource in all seasons of public danger [and for the space of four hundred years, it is remarkable, that no person appointed to this high and paramount office, however popular or victorious, ever sought to pfolong his authority beyond the settled period, or to withdraw himself from public enquiry]. 6. The death of Tarquin removed one check against the tyranny of the higher over the lower"], [177, "SECT. 25. 149 ANCIENT HISTORY. orders ; for the latter had hitherto kept alive a salutary apprehension, that, in case of extreme oppression, they would be under the necessity of calling back their king. When this fear was at an end, the domineering spirit of the Patricians, exceeding every bound both of good policy and humanity, drove the people at length to deeds of mutiny and rebellion. An alarm from the enemy gave full weight to their power, and made the chief magistrates of the state solemnly engage their honour to procure a redress of their grievances,' as soon as the public danger was at an end. The promise, either from a failure of will or of power, was not fulfilled, and this violation of faith drove the people at length to extremities. Bound by their military oath not to desert their standards, they carried them along with them ; and the whole army, in military array, withdrew from Rome, and deliberately encamped on the Mons Sacer, at three miles' distance from the city ; and here they were soon joined by the greatest part of the people. This resolute procedure had its desired effect. The senate deputed ten persons, the most respectable of their order, with plenary powers ; and these, seeing no medium of compromise, granted to the people all their demands. The debts were l 3"], [178, "150 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. solemnly abolished; and x for the security of their privileges in future, they were allowed the right of choosing magistrates of their own order, who should have the power of opposing with effect every measure which they should judge prejudicial to their interests. These were the Tribunes of the people, chosen annually ; at first five in number, and afterwards increased to ten. Without guards or tribunal, and having no seat in the senate-house, they had yet the power, by a single veto, to suspend or annul the decrees of the senate and the sentences of the consuls. Their persons were declared sacred, but their authority was confined to the limits of a mile from the city. The Tribunes demanded and obtained two magistrates to assist them, who were termed \u00c6diles, from the charge committed to them of the buildings of the city. 7- From this \u00e6ra (\"260 years from the found ation of Rome) we date the commencement of the popular constitution of the Roman republic ; a change operated by the unwise policy of the Patricians themselves, who, by yielding to just complaints, and humanely redressing flagrant abuses, might have easily anticipated every ground of dissatisfaction. The first wish of the people was not power, but relief from tyranny"], [179, "SECT. 25. 151 ANCIENT HISTORY. and oppression ; and had this been readily granted them, if not by abolishing the debts, at least by repressing enormous usury, and putting an end to the inhuman right of corporal punish ment and the bondage of debtors, the people would have cheerfully returned to order and submission, and the Roman constitution have long remained what we have seen it was at the commencement of the consular government, aristocratical. But the plebeians now obtaining magistrates of their own order with those high powers, we shall see it become the object of the magistrates to increase their authority by continual demands and bold encroachments. The people, regarding them as the champions of their rights, are delighted to find themselves gradually approaching to a level with the higher order ; and, no longer bounding their desires to ease and security, are soon equally influenced by ambition as their superiors. While this people, borne down by injustice, seek no more than the redress of real grievances, we sympa thise with their feelings, and applaud their spirited exertions ; but compassing at length the end they wished, attaining ease and security, nay, power, which they had neither sought nor expected ; when we see them, after this, increas- i, 4'"], [180, "152 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. ing in their demands, assuming that arrogance they jusly blamed in their superiors, goaded on by the ambition of their leaders to tyrannise in their turn ; we view with proper discrimination the love of liberty and its extreme licentiousness ; and treat with just detestation the authors of those pernicious measures which embroiled the state in endless faction, and paved the way for the total loss of that liberty, of which this deluded people knew not the value when they actually possessed it. XXVI. THE LAW OF VOLERO. 1. The disorders of the commonwealth, ap peased by the creation of the Tribunes, were but for a time suspended. It was necessary that the popular magistrates should make an experi ment of their powers. In an assembly of the people, one of the consuls, interrupted by a tribune, rashly said, that had tne tribunes called that assembly, he would not have interrupted them. This was a concession on the part of the consuls, that the tribunes had the power of"], [181, "SECT. 26. 153 ANCIENT HISTORY. assembling the comitia, which from that moment they assumed as their acknowledged right. It was a consequence of this right, that the affairs of the commonwealth should be agitated in those meetings, equally as in the assemblies held in virtue of a consular summons, or senatorial decree, and thus there were, in a manner, two distinct legislative powers established in the re public. [For it was soon brought to that issue, that whenever the senate refused to confirm the Plebiscita, or decrees of the tribunitial assemblies, the people refused to pay any deference or obe dience to the Senatus-Consulta.~\\ 2. The trial of Coriolanus for inconsiderately proposing the abolition of the Tribunate, an offence interpreted to be treason against the state, threw an additional weight into the scale of the people. [For by this the plebeians absolutely acquired and established a right to become judges of the patricians, and to call before their tribunal the greatest men in the commonwealth, and to decide their fate. The peculiar character of Coriolanus, and the uncontroulable impetuosity of the proceedings against him being particularly calculated to show to how great an ascendancy the popular party had attained, and how entirely the nature of the government was changed.] The"], [182, "154 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. proposal of an Agrarian law, for the division of the lands acquired by recent conquests, resumed at intervals, though never carried into execution, inflamed the passions of the rival orders. 3. Publius Volero, formerly a centurion, and a man distinguished for his military services, had, in the new levies, been ranked as a common soldier. Complaining of this unmerited degra dation, he refused his services in that capacity ; and the consuls having condemned him to corporal punishment, he appealed from their sentence to the people. The contest lasted till the annual term of elections, when Volero him self was chosen a tribune of the people. He had an ample revenge, by procuring the enactment of a most important law. The comitia, by cen turies and by curi\u00e6, could not be called but in virtue of a decree of the senate, after consulting the auspices ; and in those comitia the tribunes had hitherto been elected, and the most import ant public affairs discussed. It was decreed by the law of Volero, that the election of the tribunes should be made, and the chief public business henceforward discussed, in the comitia held by tribes, which were unfettered by any of those restraints [and thus the whole power of the patricians might be said to be transferred at"], [183, "SECT. 27. 155 ANCIENT HISTORY. once to the plebeians ; for while in the Comitia Centuriata the former were sure to prevail by means of their wealth, and in the Comitia Curiata both by their wealth and patronage, in the Comitia Tributa, there being only four tribes in the city, and as many as seventeen in the country, the patricians had no longer under such an arrangement, any proportionable weight either in the way of wealth, patronage, or numbers, to oppose to the wills and decrees of the commons]. From this period, the supreme authority in the Roman republic may be considered as having passed completely from the higher order into the hands of the people. The Roman constitu tion was now plainly a democracy, 471 B. C. XXVII. THE DECEMVIRATE. 1. The Romans had, till this period, no body of civil laws. Under the regal government the kings alone administered justice ; [though not altogether without consulting the people, as Cicero has observed in the case of the Horatii ;J"], [184, "156 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. the consuls succeeded them in this high pre rogative; and thus possessed, without control, the absolute command of the fortunes and civil rights of all the citizens. [For acting upon laws not known to the people at large, they had, as it were, merely a penal jurisdiction ; there was no preventive justice.] To remedy this great defect, Terentillus, a tribune, proposed the nomination of ten commissioners, to frame and digest a code of laws for the explanation and security of the rights of all orders of the state. A measure so equitable ought to have met with no opposition. It was, however, strenuously, though ineffectually, opposed by the patricians, who, by a fruitless contest, [which continued eight years,] only exposed their own weakness. The decemviri were chosen ; but the election being made in the comitia by centuries, the consul Appius Claudius, [the third of that name,] with his colleague, were at the head of this important commission [associated with five others of similar rank, and three senators, who had been specially deputed to Athens to examine and make collections from the laws of Solon and other Grecian legislators *]. The laws were * [Gibbon after Bonamy questions the fact of this embassy, but Mr. Butler in his Hor\u00e6 Juridic\u00e6 admits it.]"], [185, "SECT. 27. ANCIENT HISTORY. 157 framed, those celebrated statutes known by the name of the Twelve Tables, which are the basis of the great structure of the Roman jurispru dence, 451 B. C. \u2014 [Great care had been taken to have the concurrence of the people, by expos ing the several laws in the most conspicuous parts of the forum, and inviting observation, for the purposes of amendment or correction.] 2. An acquaintance with these ancient laws is therefore of importance. Even in the most flourishing times of the republic they continued to be of the highest authority. They have the encomium of Cicero himself; [qualified, however, with some hints at a reform;] and we learn from him, that to commit these laws to memory was an essential part of a liberal education. From the twelve tables the juris-consulti composed a system of judicial forms, for the regulation of the different tribunals. The number of the laws was likewise from time to time increased by the Senatus-Consulta and Plebiscita. 3. The decemvirs were invested with all the powers of government, for the consulate had ceased on their creation. [They were even freed from any popular interruption by the sus pension of the tribunate.] Each decemvir by turn presided for a day, and had the sovereign"], [186, "158 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. authority, with its insignia, the fasces. The nine others officiated solely as judges in the determination of law-suits, and the correction of abuses. An abuse, however, of the most flagrant nature, committed by the chief of their own number, [in the third year of their rule,] was destined speedily to bring their office to its termination. 4. Appius Claudius, [who had very artfully managed to get himself re-chosen on the dissolu tion of the first decemvirate, and to associate with himself persons entirely devoted to his will,] inflamed by lawless passion for the young Virginia, the betrothed spouse of Icilius, formerly a tribune of the people, employed a profligate dependent to claim the maiden as his own pro perty, on the false pretence of her being the daughter of one of his female slaves. The claim was made to the decemvir himself in judgment, who pronounced an infamous decree, which tore from her family this helpless victim, and put her into the hands of his own minion. Her father, to save the honour of his child, plunged a dagger into her breast ; and the people, witnesses of this shocking sqene, would have massacred Appius on the spot, had he not found means to escape amidst the tumult. Their vengeance,"], [187, "SECT. 28. ANCIENT HISTORY. 159 however, was satiated by the instant abolition of this hated magistracy, and by the death of Appius, who chose by his own hand to prevent the stroke of the executioner. The decemvirate had subsisted for three years. The consuls were now restored, together with the tribunes of the people, 449 B. C. [But the laws were estab lished, the people wisely distinguishing between the merit of the work, and the infamy of its authors.] XXVIII. INCREASE OF THE POPULAR POWER. 1. The scale of the people was daily acquir ing weight, at the expense of that of the highest order. Two barriers, however, still separated the patricians and plebeians ; the one, a law which prevented their intermarriage, and the other, the constitutional limitation of all the higher offices to the order of the patricians. It was now only necessary to remove these re straints, and the patricians and plebeians were on a footing of perfect equality. The first, after a long but fruitless contest, was at length"], [188, "160 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. agreed to by the senate ; and this concession had its usual effect of stimulating the people to inflexible perseverance in their struggle for the latter. On an emergence of war, the customary device was practised, of refusing to enter the rolls, unless upon the immediate enactment of a law, which should admit their capacity of hold ing all the offices of the republic. The senate sought a palliative, by the creation of six military tribunes in lieu of the consuls, three of whom should be patricians, and three plebeians. This measure satisfied the people for a time : the con suls, however, were soon restored. 2. The disorders of the republic, and frequent wars, had interrupted the regular survey of the citizens. This was remedied by the creation of a new magistracy. Two officers, under the title of Censors, were appointed, (437 B. C.) whose duty was not only to make the census every five years, but to inspect the morals and regulate the duties of all the citizens ; [having power to degrade senators, dismount knights, and even remove plebeians,- by turning them down from a superior to an inferior tribe. It was always] an office of dignity equal to its importance, ex ercised in the latter times of the republic, only"], [189, "SECT. 28. 161 ANCIENT HISTORY. by consular persons, and afterwards annexed to the supreme function of the emperor. 3. The dissensions between the orders con tinued [for several years] with little variation either in their causes or effects. [The consuls were superseded by military tribunes, and the latter by consuls again, while] the people, gene rally, as the last resource, refused to enrol them selves, till overawed by the supreme authority of a dictator. To obviate the frequent necessity of this measure, which enforced at best an un willing and compelled obedience, the senate had recourse to a wise expedient ; this was, to give a regular pay to the troops [an expedient easily rendered agreeable to the unreflecting po pulace, who, though accustomed to take the field stimulated by the hopes and prospect of plunder, generally left their farms unfilled, so as in the ensuing season to be reduced to borrow, subject to all the vexations and distresses arising out of usurious contracts]. To defray this expense, a moderate tax was imposed in proportion to the fortunes of the citizens. From this period the Roman system of war assumed a new aspect. The senate always found soldiers at command ; the army was under its control ; the enterprises of the republic were more extensive, and its VOL. I. M"], [190, "162 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. successes more signal and important. Veii, the proud rival of Rome, and its equal in extent and population, was taken by Camillus, after a siege of ten years, A.U.C. 396. The art of war was improved, as it now became a profes sion, instead of an occasional occupation. The Romans were, from this circumstance, an over match for all their neighbours. Their domi nion, hitherto confined to the territory of a few miles, was now rapidly extended. It was im possible but the detached states of Italy must have given way before a people always in arms, and who, by a perseverance alike resolute and judicious, were equal to every attempt in which they engaged. 4. The taking of Veii was succeeded by a war with the Gauls. This people, a branch of the great nation of the Celt\u00e6, had opened to themselves a passage through the Alps at four different periods, and wTere at this time estab lished in the country between those mountains and the Appenines. Under the command of Brennus, they laid siege to the Etruscan Clu sium ; and this people, of no warlike turn them selves, solicited the aid of the Romans. The circumstances recorded of this war with the Gauls throw over it a cloud of fable and romance. 5"], [191, "SECT. 28. 163 ANCIENT HISTORY. The formidable power of Rome is said to have been in a single campaign so utterly exhausted, that the Gauls entered the city without resist ance, and burnt it to the ground, 385 B. C. Though thus overpowered, the Romans, in a single engagement, [under Camillus, who re turned from a state of banishment, to save his country,] retrieve all their losses, and in one day's time there is not a Gaul left remaining within the Roman territory. To the burning of the city by the Gauls, the Roman writers attribute the loss of all the re cords and monuments of their early history. 5. It is singular, that most of the Roman revolutions should have owed their origin to women. From this cause we have seen spring the abolition of the regal office and the decem virate. From this cause arose the change of the constitution, by which the plebeians became capable of holding the highest offices of the commonwealth. The younger daughter of Fa bius Ambustus, married to a plebeian, envious of the honours of her elder sister, the wife of a patrician, stimulated her father to rouse the lower order to a resolute purpose of asserting their equal right with the patricians to all the offices and dignities of the state. After much u 2"], [192, "164 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART ft turbulence and contest, the final issue was the admission of the plebeians, first to the consulate, and afterwards to the censorship, the pr\u00e6torship, and priesthood (A.U.C. 454, and B.C. 300); a change beneficial in the main, as consolidating the strength of the republic, and cutting off the principal source of intestine disorder. The fac tions of the state had hitherto confined the growth of its power, its splendour, and pros perity ; for no state can at once be prosperous and anarchical. We shall now mark the rapid elevation of the Roman name and empire. XXIX. CONQUEST OF ITALY BY THE ROMANS. 1. The war with the Samnites now began, and was of long continuance ; but its successful termination was speedily followed by the reduc tion of all the states of Italy. In the course of this important war, the Tarentines, the allies of the Samnites, sought the aid of Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, one of the greatest generals of his age. Pyrrhus landed in Italy with 30,000 men,"], [193, "SECT. 29. 165 ANCIENT HISTORY. and a train of elephants, 280 B. C. He was at first successful, but no longer so than till a short experience reconciled the Romans to a new mode of war [for it was the first contest be tween Greeks and Romans, between the legion and the phalanx ; the first occasion on which the Roman soldier had to contend with and to face the ponderous elephant, more formidable to the cavalry than the infantry, the horses being thrown into confusion, through dread of their noise, and disgust at their smell]. Sensible at length of the difficulties of his enterprise, and dreading a fatal issue, Pyrrhus embraced an in vitation from the Sicilians to aid them in a war with Carthage. On this pretext, which at least was not dishonourable, Pyrrhus withdrew his troops from Italy. In this interval the Romans reduced the Samnites, the Tarentines, and the other allied states to extremity. Pyrrhus re turned, and made a last effort near Beneventum. He was totally defeated, lost 26,000 men, and, abandoning at once all further views upon Italy, returned with precipitation to his own domi nions, 274 B. C. The hostile states submitted to the victorious power ; and Rome, 480 years from the foundation of the city, was now mis. tress of all Italy. m 3"], [194, "166 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. 2. The policy observed by the Romans, with respect to the conquered nations, was wise and judicious. They removed to Rome all the lead ing men of the principal conquered cities, ad mitting these into the ancient urban and rustic tribes, and thus soothing the pride of the van quished, by giving them an apparent share in their own domestic government ; while in ar ranging the constitution of the cities, they filled their magistracies with illustrious Romans, whose abilities and influence were fitted to maintain those new provinces in allegiance to the Roman government. 3. Sicily had long been considered as the granary of Italy. The Carthaginians at this time possessed very considerable settlements in the island, and were ambitious of acquiring its entire dominion. An obvious policy led the Romans to dispute with them this important acquisition, and gave rise to the Punic wars. This leads, by a natural connection, to a short view of the history of Carthage and of Sicily."], [195, "SECT. 30. 167 ANCIENT HISTORY. XXX. HISTORY OF CARTHAGE. 1. Carthage, according to the most probable accounts, was founded by a colony of Tyrians, about seventy years before the building of Rome. The colony had the same language, the same or nearly similar laws and constitution, the same national character with the parent state. The city of Carthage was, at the period of the Punic wars, one of the most splendid in the universe, and had under its dominion 300 of the smaller cities of Africa bordering on the Mediterranean sea. 2. The constitution of the republic is cele brated by Aristotle as one of the most perfect of the governments of antiquity ; but we know little <nore than its general nature from ancient writers. Two magistrates named Suffetes, annu ally chosen, seem to have possessed powers akin to those of the Roman consuls [except that the latter engaged in military expeditions, while the former strictly confined themselves to civil affairs]. The Carthaginian senate [also resem- m 4"], [196, "168 ancient history. PART I. bled] that of Rome; with this remarkable differ- ence that, in the former, unanimity of opinion was requisite in all measures of importance. A divided senate transmitted the business to the assembly of the people [a reference which na- turally laid the foundation for cabals and fac- tions ; which led the rich to court the populace, and descend to actions unbecoming their condi- tion in life. In course of time every thing became venal, the commonwealth was neglected, and the leaders of the several parties thought only of themselves. But these things did certainly not take place so soon as might have been ex- pected]. A tribunal of 104 judges took cogni- sance of military operations and of the conduct of their generals. A superior council of five seems to have controlled the decisions of the larger tribunal. Two peculiarities of the Car- thaginian policy have been censured by Aristo- tle. One was, that the same person might hold several employments or offices in the state ; the other, that the poor were debarred from all offices of trust or importance. But the former of these is frequently both expedient and neces- sary, and the latter seems agreeable to the sound- est policy ; for in offices of trust, poverty offers too powerful an incitement to deviation from"], [197, "sect. 30. 169 ANCIENT HISTORY. duty. [The people were extremely superstitious, and their rites barbarous, human victims being often sacrificed. They were, also, proverbially treacherous and unfaithful. Punka Fides, and Punica Religio, are, in the classical writers, but other terms for hypocrisy and deceit.] 3. The first settlements made by the Cartha ginians were entirely in the way of commerce [which appears to have been the pursuit of all ranks and classes]. Trading to the coast of Spain for gold, they built Carthagena and Gades ; and coasting along the western shore of Africa, they had establishments for the same purpose as far as the 25th degree of N. latitude. The Periplus of Hanno affords a proof of ardent enterprise and policy. Desirous of extending a limited territory, they armed against the Mauritanians, Numidians, and all the neighbouring nations; employing mercenary troops, which they levied, not only in Africa, but in Spain, the Gauls, and Greece. 4. The annals of the Carthaginian state are but little known till their wars with the Romans. The first of their wars mentioned in history is that with the Greek colonies of Sicily. Darius courted their alliance when he meditated the conquest of Greece, and Xerxes renewed that"], [198, "170 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. treaty when he followed out the designs of his father. XXXI. HISTORY OF SICILY. 1 . The early periods of the history of Sicily are no less unknown than those of Carthage. The Ph\u0153nicians had sent colonies thither before the Trojan war. The Greeks, in after times, made considerable settlements in the island. The Corinthians founded Syracuse, which be came the most illustrious of the Greek cities of Sicily ; and from Syracuse arose afterwards Agrigentum, Acra, Casmene, Camarene, and several other Sicilian towns. 2. The government of Syracuse was monar chical, and might long have remained so, had all its sovereigns inherited the abilities and virtues of Gelon. But his successors, exercising the worst of tyranny, compelled their subjects at length to abolish the regal government; and their example was speedily followed by all the Gre cian states of Sicily. 3. The monarchy of Syracuse, however, was"], [199, "sect. 31. 171 ANCIENT HISTORY. revived about sixty years after in the person of Dionysius, a man of obscure origin, but of signal ability. Twice expelled for a tyrannical exer cise of dominion, he as often found means to overpower his enemies, and re-establish himself in the throne. At his death, the crown passed, without opposition, to his son, Dionysius the Younger, a weak and capricious tyrant, whom his subjects, judging unworthy to reign, de throned and banished, 357 B. C. The crown was conferred on Dion, his brother-in-law : but this prince, whose amiable character rendered him the delight of his people, after a short reign, fell a victim to treason. Aided by the distrac tions of Syracuse consequent on this event, Dio nysius remounted the throne, ten years after his expulsion ; but his tyrannical disposition, height ened by his misfortunes, became at length so intolerable, that he was expelled a second time, and banished to Corinth, where he ended his days in poverty and obscurity. The author of this revolution was the illustrious Timoleon, to whose abilities and virtues his country owed equally its liberty and its subsequent happiness and prosperity, 343 B. C."], [200, "172 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. The signal opposition of national character between the Romans and Carthaginians may be easily accounted for, when we attend to the effects of a commercial life on the genius and manners of a nation. The vices of a commer cial people are, selfishness, cunning, avarice, with an absence of every heroic and patriotic virtue. The favourable effects of commerce are, industry, frugality, general courtesy of man ners, improvement in the useful arts. Attend ing to these consequences of the prevalence of the commercial spirit, we shall see the principal features of the Carthaginian character opposed to the Roman. XXXII. THE PUNIC WARS. 1. The triumph which the Romans had ob tained over Pyrrhus seemed to give assurance of success in any enterprise in which they should engage. The Mamertines, a people of Campania, [who had been called into Sicily by Agathocles to assist him in his wars, being desirous of settling themselves in the island,] obtained aid from the"], [201, "sect. 32. ancient history. 173 Romans in an unjustifiable attempt which they made to seize Messina, a Sicilian town allied to Syracuse. The Syracusans, at first, assisted by the Carthaginians, opposed this invasion; but the former, more alarmed by the ambitious en croachments of the Carthaginians on Sicily, soon repented of this rash allance, and joined the Ro mans in the purpose of expelling the Carthagi nians entirely from the island. In fact, the Si cilians seem to have had only the desperate choice of final submission either to Rome or Carthage. They chose the former, as the alter native least dishonourable : the Romans had ever been their friends, the Carthaginians their enemies. [To the former it was become par ticularly valuable, from its large supplies of corn.] 2. Agrigentum, possessed by the Carthagi nians, was taken, after a long siege, by the joint forces of Rome and Syracuse, and a Roman fleet, the first they ever had, [for the purposes of maritime warfare,] and equipped [in a most extraordinary manner in the compass of only] a few weeks, gained a complete victory over that of Carthage, at this time the greatest maritime power in the world, 260 B. C. These successes were followed by the reduction of Corsica"], [202, "174 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. and Sardinia. In a second naval engagement, the Romans took from the Carthaginians sixty of their ships of war, and now resolutely pre pared for the invasion of Africa. The consul Regulus [the most consummate warrior Rome had to send out] commanded the expedition. He advanced to the gates of Carthage ; and such was the general consternation, that the enemy proposed a capitulation. Inspirited, however, by a timely aid of Greek troops under Xantippus, the Carthaginians made a desperate effort, and defeating the Roman army, [with im mense loss on the part of the latter,] made Regulus their prisoner. But repeatedly de feated in Sicily, [and jealous of the help they had received from a stranger,] they became at length seriously desirous of a peace ; and the Roman general was sent with their ambassadors to Rome to aid the negociation, under a solemn oath to return to Carthage as a prisoner, should the treaty fail. It was rejected, [in a very ex traordinary manner,] at the urgent desire of Regulus himself, who, [neglecting all private considerations, and renouncing every personal comfort,] sacrificed his [family, his property, and his] life, to what he judged the interest of"], [203, "SECT. 32. ANCIENT HISTORY. 175 his country. [He died by torture on his return to Africa.] 3. Lilyb\u0153um, the strongest of the Sicilian towns belonging to Carthage, was taken, after a siege of nine years. Aster some alternate successes, two naval battles won by the Romans terminated the war ; and Carthage at last ob tained a peace on the humiliating terms of abandoning to the Romans all her possessions in Sicily, the payment of 3200 talents of silver, the restitution of all prisoners without ransom, and a solemn engagement never to make war against Syracuse or her allies. The island of Sicily was now declared a Roman province, though Syracuse maintained her independent government, A. U. C. 511, and B. C. 241. 4. The peace between Rome and Carthage was of twenty-three years' duration. The latter power was recruiting her strength, and medi tated to revenge her losses and disgrace. The second Punic war began on the part of the Car thaginians, who besieged Saguntum, a city of Spain in alliance with the Romans. The young Hannibal [who had been bred a soldier, under his father Hamilcar, and bound by oath to op pose the Romans,] took Saguntum, after a siege of seven months ; the desperate inhabitants set-"], [204, "176 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. ting fire to the town, and perishing amidst the flames. Hannibal [in revenge of the insults of fered by the Romans to his native city in Africa,] now formed the bold design of carrying the war into Italy. He provided against every diffi culty, gained to his interest a part of the Gallic tribes, passed the Pyrenees, and finally the Alps*, in a toilsome march of five months and a half from his leaving Carthagena ; and arrived in Italy with 20,000 foot and 6000 horse [though the amount of his force has been differently esti mated by different historians]. 5. In the first engagement the Romans were defeated, and they lost two other important bat tles at Trebia and the lake Thrasymenus. In the latter of these the consul Flaminius was kill ed, and his army cut to pieces. Hannibal ad vanced to Cann\u00e6 in Apulia [under particular advantages, in regard to situation] ; and the Ro mans there opposing him with their whole force, * The passage of Hannibal over the Alps has been lately illustrated, in a most learned and ingenious essay, by Mr. Whitaker, (the celebrated historian of Manchester, and vin dicator of Queen Mary,) who has, with great acuteness, traced every step of the Carthaginian general, from his cross ing the Rhone to his final arrival in Italy."], [205, "SECT. 32. 177 ANCIENT HISTORY. [through the rashness of the consul Terentius Varro,] a memorable defeat ensued, in which 40,000 were lest dead upon the field, and amongst these the consul \u00c6milius, [who would have deferred the engagement,] and almost the whole body of the Roman knights. Had Han nibal taken advantage of this great victory, by instantly attacking Rome, the fate of the repub lic was inevitable ; but he deliberated, and the occasion was lost. The Romans concentrated all their strength ; even the slaves armed in the common cause, and victory once more attended the standards of the republic. Philip [the Se cond] King of Macedon joined his forces to the Carthaginians, [under a promise of invading Italy with 200 ships,] but, being defeated by [the consul] L\u00e6vinus, he speedily withdrew his assist ance. Hannibal retreated before the brave Marcellus. Syracuse had now taken part with Carthage, and thus paved the way for the loss of her own liberty. Marcellus besieged the city, which was long defended by the inventive genius of Archimedes, but taken in the third year by escalade in the night [Archimedes himself being slain in his own house by a Roman soldier]. This event put an end to the kingdom of Syracuse, which now became a part of the VOL. I. N"], [206, "178 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. Roman province of Sicily, A. U. C. 542, B. C. 212. 6. While the war in Italy was prosperously conducted by the great Fabius, who, by con stantly avoiding a general engagement, found the true method of weakening his enemy, the younger Scipio accomplished the entire reduc tion of Spain. Asdrubal was sent into Italy to the aid of his brother Hannibal, but was de feated by the consul Claudius, and slain in bat tle. Scipio, triumphant in Spain, [returned to Rome, and being made consul at the age of twenty-nine, and having Sicily assigned to him as his province with a view to his attempts against the enemies of Rome,] passed over into Africa, and carried havoc and devastation to the gates of Carthage. Alarmed for the fate of their empire, [Scipio having been joined by Massi nissa, one of the most powerful chieftains of the country,] the Carthaginians hastily recalled Han nibal from Italy. The battle of Zama decided the fate of the war, by the utter defeat of the Carthaginians. They entreated a peace, which the Romans gave on these conditions : That the Carthaginians should abandon Spain, Sicily, and all the islands ; surrender all their prisoners, give up the whole of their fleet except ten gal-"], [207, "SECT. 82. 179 ANCIENT HISTORY. lies, pay 10,000 talents, and, in future, under take no war without the consent of the Romans, A. U. C. 552, B. C. 202. 7. Every thing now concurred to swell the pride of the conquerors, and to extend their do minion. A war with Philip of Macedon [pro fessedly in support of the freedom of the Greeks] was terminated by his defeat ; and his son Demetrius was sent to Rome as a hostage for the payment of a heavy tribute imposed on the vanquished. A war with Antiochus, King of Syria, [with whom Hannibal on his expulsion from Carthage had taken refuge,] ended in his ceding to the Romans [under the command of Lucius Scipio, brother of Scipio Africanus,] the whole of the Lesser Asia. But these splendid conquests, while they enlarged the empire, were fatal to its virtues, and subversive of the pure and venerable simplicity of ancient times. [The interval between the second and third Punic wars has been selected, by eminent writers, as the period in which the last rays of republican glory and virtue shed their lustre on Rome.] 8. The third Punic war began A. U. C. 605, B. C. 149,- and ended in the ruin of Carthage. An unsuccessful war with the Numidians had reduced the Carthaginians to great weakness, and N 2"], [208, "180 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. the Romans meanly laid hold of that opportu nity to invade Africa. Conscious of their utter inability to resist this formidable power, the Car thaginians offered every submission,, and con sented even to acknowledge themselves the sub jects of Rome. The Romans demanded 300 hostages, for the strict performance of every condition that should be enjoined by the senate. The hostages were given ; and the condition required was, [the memorable sentence of the rigid Cato,] that Carthage itself should be \" razed to its foundation.\" Despair gave courage to this miserable people, and they determined to die in the defence of their native city. [There is something bordering on the romantic in the accounts that have been given us of the extent of their exertions.] But the noble effort was in vain. Carthage was taken by storm, [under Scipio \u00c6milianus,] its inhabitants mas sacred, and the city burnt to the ground, A. U. C. 607, B. C. 146. 9. The same year was signalised by the entire reduction of Greece under the dominion of the Romans [Macedonia having been previously subdued, and, to grace the triumph of Paulus \u00c6milianus, the last successor of Alexander, with his two sons, carried captive to Rome, and com-"], [209, "SECT. 33. 181 ANCIENT HISTORY. pelled to walk before the chariot of the victor]. This was the \u00e6ra of the dawn of luxury and taste at Rome, the natural fruit of foreign wealth, and an acquaintance with foreign manners. [In the struggle with the Grecians, Corinth having fallen, was sacked by the Romans under Mum mius, and many works of art and luxury, fell into their hands, though the majority, as is sup posed, perished in the flames ; the riches of the Romans were increased greatly also by their plunder of Asia Minor.] In the unequal dis tribution of this imported wealth, the vices to which it gave rise, the corruption and venality of which it became the instrument, we see the remoter causes of those fatal disorders to which the republic owed its dissolution. XXXIII. THE GRACCHI, AND THE CORRUPTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH. I. At this period arose Tiberius and Caius Gracchus, two noble youths, whose zeal to reform the growing corruptions of the state precipitated them at length into measures destructive of all N O"], [210, "182 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. government and social order. Tiberius, the elder of the brothers, [having been chosen tribune,] urged the people to assert by force the revival of an ancient law, for limiting pro perty in land, and thus abridging the overgrown estates of the patricians. [To which end he procured three new officers to be appointed, whom he called Triumviri, and whose business it was to take strict account of every man's pro perty, and to allow of no additions being made to it beyond the law.] A tumult was the con sequence, in which Tiberius, with 300 of his friends, were killed in the forum. This fatal ex ample did not deter his brother, Caius Gracchus, [who possessed greater abilities and was more eloquent than Tiberius,] from pursuing [not very long afterwards,] a similar career of zeal or of ambition. After some successful experiments of his power, while in the office of tribune, he directed his scrutiny into the corruptions of the senate, and prevailed in depriving that body of its constitutional control over all the inferior magistrates of the state. Employing, however, like his brother, the dangerous engine of tumul tuary force, [to which indeed he was a good deal provoked by the conduct of the senate,] he fell a victim to it himself^ with 3000 of his par-"], [211, "SECT. 33. ANCIENT HISTORY. 183 tisans, who were slaughtered in the streets of Rome. The tumults attending the sedition of the Gracchi were the prelude to those civil disorders which now followed in quick succes sion to the end of the commonwealth. 2. The circumstances attending the war with Jugurtha [in Africa] gave decisive proof of the corruption of the Roman manners. Jugurtha, grandson of Massinissa, [the ally of Scipio,] sought to usurp the crown of Numidia by de stroying his cousins, Hiempsal and Adherbal, the sons of the last king. He murdered the elder of the brothers ; and the younger, applying for aid to Rome, Jugurtha bribed the senate, who basely declared him innocent of all culpable act or design, and decreed to him the sovereignty of half the kingdom. This operated only as an incentive to his criminal ambition. He declared open war against his cousin, besieged him in his capital of Cirta, and finally put him to death. To avert a threatened war, Jugurtha went in person to Rome, pleaded his own cause in the senate, and once more by bribery secured his acquittal from all charge of criminality. A per severance, however, in a similar train of conduct [contrary to the advice and remonstrances of Scipio, who ably foresaw that he would fall a n 4"], [212, "184 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. victim to the corruption he had stooped to encourage,] finally drew on him the vengeance of the Romans ; and being betrayed into their hands by his own father-in-law, he was brought in chains to Rome, to grace the triumph of the Consul Marius, confined to a dungeon, and starved to death, A.U.C. 651, B.C. 103. 3. The ambition of the allied states of Italy to attain the rights of citizenship produced the Social war, which ended in a concession of those rights to such of the confederates as should return peaceably to their allegiance. This war with the allies was a prelude to that which followed between Rome and her own citizens. Sylla and Marius, rivals, and thence enemies, were at this time the leaders of the republic. Sylla [having obtained the] command of a war against Mith ridates, was [through the intrigues of Marius] superseded, and recalled [on the eve of his de parture for] Asia. He refused to obey the mandate ; and found his army well disposed to support him. \" Let us march to Rome,\" said they, with one voice ; \" lead us on to avenge the \" cause of oppressed liberty.\" Sylla accordingly led them on, and they entered Rome sword in hand ; Marius and his partisans fled with pre cipitation from the city, and Sylla ruled for a"], [213, "SECT. 33. 185 ANCIENT HISTORY. while triumphant. But the faction of his rival soon recovered strength. Marius, returning to Italy, and joining his forces to those of Cinna, his zealous partisan, laid siege to Rome ; and, while Sylla was engaged in the Mithridatic war, compelled the city to absolute submission. After a horrible massacre of all whom they esteemed their enemies, Marius and Cinna proclaimed themselves consuls, without the formality of an election ; but Marius died a few days after in a fit of debauch. 4. After a victorious campaign in Asia, Sylla returned to Italy, and, joined by Cethegus, Verres, and the young Pompey, gave battle to the party of his enemies, and entirely defeated them. His entry into Rome was signalised by a dreadful massacre, and a proscription, which had for its object the extermination of every enemy whom he had in Italy. Elected dictator for an unlimited period, he was now without a rival in authority, and absolute master of the govern ment, which, of course, was substantially no longer a republic. In the exercise of his domi nion, he deserved more praise than in the means of acquiring it. He restored the senate to its judicial authority, regulated the election to all the important offices of state, and enacted many"], [214, "186 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. excellent laws against oppression and the abuse of power. Finally, he gave demonstration, if not of a pure conscience, at least of a magnani mous intrepidity of character, by voluntarily re signing all command, retiring to the condition of a private citizen, and offering publicly to give an account of his conduct. He died within a short time after his resignation : \u2014 a man certainly of great strength of mind, and who had some of the qualities of an heroic character ; but he lived in evil times, when it was impossible at once to be great and to be virtuous. 5. The death of Sylla renewed the civil war. Lepidus, a man of mean abilities, aspired to suc ceed him in power ; and Pompey, with superior talents, cherished the same ambition. While the latter was employed in the reduction of the revolted provinces of Asia, the conspiracy of Catiline threatened the entire destruction of Rome. It was extinguished by the provident zeal and active patriotism of the consul Cicero ; and Catiline himself, with his chief accomplices, were attacked in the field, and defeated by [the army under Petreius, lieutenant of the consul,] Antonius [absent through illness]. The traitor made a desperate defence, and died a better death than his crimes had merited. [His party fought"], [215, "SECT. 33. ANCIENT HISTORY. 187 furiously to the very last, not so much with any hope of obtaining the advantage, as resolved to sell the victory as dearly as possible.] 6. Julius C\u00e6sar now rose into public notice. Sylla dreaded his abilities and ambition, and had numbered him among the proscribed. \" There is many a Marius,\" said he, \" in the person of that young man.\" He had learned prudence from the danger of his situation, and tacitly courted popularity, without that show of enter prize which gives alarm to a rival. While Pompey and Crassus contended for the command of the republic, C\u00e6sar, who knew, that by at taching himself to either rival, he infallibly made the other his enemy, showed the reach of his talents by reconciling them, and thus acquiring the friendship of both. From favour to their mutual friend, they agreed to a partition of power; and thus was formed the first Triumvirate. C\u00e6sar was elected consul. He increased his popularity by a division of lands among the poorer citizens, and strengthened his interest with Pompey, by giving him his daughter in marriage. He had the command of four legions, and the government of Transalpine Gaul and Illyria."], [216, "188 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART 1. 7. The military glory of the republic, and the reputation of C\u00e6sar, were nobly sustained in Gaul. In the first year of his government he subdued the Helvetii, who, leaving their own country, had attempted to settle themselves in the better regions of the Roman province. He totally defeated the Germans under Ariovistus, who had attempted a similar invasion. The Belg\u00e6, the Nervii, the Celtic Gauls, the Suevi, Menapii, and other warlike nations, were all successively brought under subjection [C\u00e6sar knowing as well how to take advantage of their dissensions at home as to get the better of them in the field]. In the fourth year of his govern- ment, he transported his army into Britain. Landing at Deal, he was opposed by the natives with equal courage and military skill. He gained, however, several advantages, and binding the Britons to submission, withdrew, on the approach of winter, into Gaul. He returned in the fol- lowing summer with a greater force, and pro- secuting his victories, reduced a considerable portion of the island under the Roman dominion, B. C. 54. But the pressure of affairs in Italy suspended for a time the progress of the Roman arms in Britain."], [217, "SECT. 33. ANCIENT HISTORY. 189 8. C\u00e6sar dreaded the abilities of Cicero, who had opposed him in his views of ambition. By the machinations of his partisans, while himself absent in Gaul, he procured the banishment of Cicero, and the confiscation of his estates, on the pretence of illegal measures pursued in the suppression of the conspiracy of Catiline. Dur ing an exile of sixteen months in Greece, Cicero gave wray to a despondency of mind utterly un worthy of the philosopher. Pompey had aban doned him, and this ungrateful desertion bore most heavily upon his mind : but Pompey him self, in the wane of his reputation, soon became desirous to prop his own sinking fortunes by the abilities of Cicero, and eagerly promoted his recall from exile. The death of Crassus, in a rash expedition against the Parthians, [with whose country he was not sufficiently ac quainted,] now dissolved the Triumvirate; and C\u00e6sar and Pompey, whose union had no other bond than interest, began each to conceive se parately the view of undivided dominion."], [218, "190 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I XXXIV. PROGRESS OF THE CIVIL WARS. \u2014 SECOND TRI- UMVIRATE. \u2014 AND FALL OF THE REPUBLIC. 1. The ambition of C\u00e6sar and of Pompey had now evidently the same object ; and it seemed to be the only question in those degenerate times, to which of these aspiring leaders the re public should surrender its liberties. The term of C\u00e6sar's government was near expiring ; but to secure himself against a deprivation of power, he procured a proposal to be made in the senate by one of his partisans, which wore the appear ance of great moderation, namely, that C\u00e6sar and Pompey should either both continue in their governments, or both be deprived of them, as they were equally capable of endangering the public liberty by an abuse of power. The mo tion passed ; and C\u00e6sar immediately offered to resign, on condition that his rival should do so ; but Pompey rejected the accommodation : the term of his government had yet several years' duration, and he suspected the proposal to be a snare laid for him by C\u00e6sar. He resolved to"], [219, "SECT. 34. ANCIENT HISTORY. 191 maintain his right by force of arms, and a civil war was the necessary consequence. The con suls and a great part of the senate were the friends of Pompey. C\u00e6sar had on his side a victorious army, consisting of ten legions, and the body of the Roman citizens, whom he had won by his liberality. Mark Antony and Cas sius, at that time tribunes of the people, left Rome, and repaired to C\u00e6sar's camp. 2. The senate, apprehensive of his designs, pronounced a decree, branding with the crime of parricide any commander who should dare to pass the Rubicon [a small rivulet near Ari minum, and] (the boundary between Italy and the Gauls) with a single cohort, without their per mission. C\u00e6sar [after meditating for some time on the irrevocable step he was disposed to take, at length] infringed the prohibition, [passed the Ru bicon,] and marched straight to Rome. Pompey, to whom the senate committed the defence of the state, had no army. He quitted Rome, followed by the consuls and a part of the senate, and en deavoured hastily to levy troops over all Italy and Greece; while C\u00e6sar triumphantly entered the city amidst the acclamations of the people, seized the public treasury, and possessed himself of the supreme authority without opposition. Having"], [220, "192 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. secured the capital of the empire, he set out to take the field against his enemies. [Pompey fled before him, and embarking at Brundusium abandoned Italy.] The lieutenants of Pompey had possession of Spain. C\u00e6sar [apprehending that if he lest them behind him, they might pass into Italy, and make it the seat of war in his absence,] marched thither, and subdued the whole country in the space of forty days, [con tending with wonderful success, not merely against skilful commanders, but the greatest im pediments of a difficult country : his soldiers almost destitute of provisions, continually wad ing through rivers up to their necks, and by sudden marches frustrating all the attempts of the enemy. On the defeat of Afranius and Pe treius, C\u00e6sar] returned victorious to Rome, where, in his absence, he had been nominated dictator. In the succeeding election of magi strates he was chosen consul, and thus invested, by a double title, with the right of acting in the name of the republic. Pompey had by this time raised a numerous army, and C\u00e6sar was anxious to bring him to a decisive engagement. He joined him in Illyria, and the first conflict was of doubtful issue ; but leading on his army to Macedonia, where they found a large reinforce-"], [221, "SECT. 34. 193 ANCIENT HISTORY. ment, [and thence to Thessaly,] he gave battle to Pompey in the field of Pharsalia, and entirely defeated him. Fifteen thousand were slain, and 24,000 surrendered themselves prisoners to the victor, A.U.C. 705, B. C. 49. 3. The fate of Pompey was miserable in the extreme. AVlth his wife, Cornelia, the com panion of his misfortunes, he fled to Egypt in a single ship, trusting to the protection of Ptolemy, whose father had owed to him his settlement on the throne. But the ministers of this young prince, dreading the power of C\u00e6sar, basely courted his favour by the murder of his rival. Brought ashore in a small boat by the guards of the king, a Roman centurion, who had fought under his own banners, stabbed him, . even in the sight of Cornelia, and cutting off his head, threw the body naked on the sands. \u2014 C\u00e6sar pursued Pompey to Alexandria, where the head of that unhappy man, presented as a grateful offering, gave him the first intelligence of his fate. He wept, and turned with horror from the sight. He caused every honour to be paid to his memory, and from that time showed the utmost beneficence to the partisans of his unfor tunate rival. 4. The sovereignty of Egypt was in dispute VOL. i. o"], [222, "194 ANCIENT HISTORY\". PART I. between Ptolemy and his sister Cleopatra. The latter, though married to her brother, and joint heir by their father's will, was ambitious of un divided authority ; and C\u00e6sar, captivated by her charms, decided the contest in favour of the beauteous queen. A war ensued, in which Ptolemy was killed, and Egypt subdued by the Roman arms. In this war the famous library of Alexandria was burnt to ashes, B. C. 48. A revolt of the Asiatic provinces, under Pharnaces the son of Mithridates, was signally chastised, and the report conveyed by C\u00e6sar to the Ro man senate in three words, Veni, vidi, vici. The conqueror returned to Rome, which needed his presence ; for Italy was divided, and the partisans of Pompey were yet extremely formi dable. His two sons, with Cato and Scipio, were in arms in Africa [Juba king of Maurita nia having joined them]. C\u00e6sar [though at first strangely interrupted by a mutiny of his veteran troops, not excepting his favourite tenth legion,] pursued them thither, and proceeding with caution till secure of his advantage, de feated them in a decisive engagement at Thap sus. Scipio perished in his passage to Spain [while Juba and his General Petreius slew each other]. Cato, shutting himself up in Utica,"], [223, "SECT. 34. 195 ANCIF.NT HISTORY. meditated a brave resistance; but finally, seeing no hope of success, he determined not to sur vive the liberties of his country, and fell deliber ately by his own hand. Mauritania was now added to the number of the Roman provinces, and C\u00e6sar returned to Rome absolute master of the empire. [His triumph lasted four days, be ing, in fact, so many distinct triumphs ; the first for Gaul ; the second for Egypt ; the third for his victories in Asia, and the last for Africa. The people were entertained at upwards of 20,000 tables : they requited his gratuities by heaping upon him all the titles and dignities of the state.] 5. From that moment his attention was directed solely to the prosperity and happiness of the Roman people. He remembered no longer that there had been opposite parties ; beneficent alike to the friends of Pompey as to his own. He laboured to reform every species of abuse or grievance. He introduced order into every department of the state, defining the separate rights of all its magistrates, and ex tending his care to the regulation of its most distant provinces. The reformation of the kalendar, the draining the marshes of Italy, the navigation of the Tiber, the embellishment of o 2"], [224, "196 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. Rome, the complete survey and delineation of the empire, alternately employed his liberal and capacious mind. [He adorned the city with magnificent buildings, and caused Carthage and Corinth to be rebuilt, establishing cplonies in both cities.] \u2014 Returning from the final over throw of Pompey's party in Spain, he was hailed the father of his country, was created consul for ten years, and perpetual dictator. [One of the months of the year was appointed to be called after his name, statues were erected to him, and money stamped with his image ; public sacrifices were appointed to be offered on his birth-day, and an apotheosis hinted at even during his life.] His person was declared sacred, his title hence forth Imperator, A. U. C. 709, B. C. 45. 6. The Roman republic had thus finally, by its own acts, resigned its liberties. They were not extinguished, as Montesquieu has well re marked, by the ambition of a Pompey or of a C\u00e6sar. If the sentiments of C\u00e6sar and Pompey had been the same with those of Cato, others would have had the same ambitious thoughts ; and since the commonwealth was fated to fall, there never would have been wanting a hand to drag it to destruction. Yet C\u00e6sar had by force subdued his country ; he therefore was an"], [225, "SECT. 34. ANCIENT HISTORY. 197 usurper ; and had it been possible to restore the liberties of the republic, and with these its hap piness, by the suppression of that usurpation, the attempt had merited the praise, at least, of good design. Perhaps so thought his murderers ; and thus, however weak their policy, however base and treacherous their act, with many they will ever find apologists. They madly dreamed an impossible issue, as the event demonstrated. 7- A conspiracy was formed by sixty of the senators, at the head of whom were Brutus and Cassius ; the former a man beloved of C\u00e6sar, who had saved his life, and heaped upon him numberless benefits. [But Brutus had imbibed the stern principles of Cato, and fancied that his name alone pointed him out as the restorer of the laws and liberty of Rome. Cassius had private piques against C\u00e6sar.] It was rumoured that the dictator wished to add to his numerous titles that of king, and that the ides of March was fixed on for investing him with the diadem. On that day, when taking his seat in the senate- house, [in contempt not only of certain omens, but of express warnings,] he was suddenly as sailed by the conspirators : he defended himself for some time against their daggers, till, seeing Brutus amongst the number, he faintly ex- o 3"], [226, "198 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. claimed, \" And you, too, my son !\" and cover ing his face with his robe, resigned himself to his fate. He fell, pierced by twenty-three wounds, A.U.C. 711, B.C. 43 [in the fifty sixth year of his age]. 8. The Roman people were struck with horror at the deed ; they loved C\u00e6sar, master as he was of their lives and liberties. Mark Antony and Lepidus, ambitious of succeeding to the power of the dictator, resolved to pave the way by avenging his death. The people, to whom C\u00e6sar, by his testament, had bequeathed a great part of his fortune, were penetrated with grati tude to his memory. A public harangue from Antony over the bleeding body, exposed in the forum, inflamed them with the utmost indigna tion against his murderers, who must have met with instant destruction, had they not escaped with precipitation from the city. Antony profited by these dispositions ; and the avenger of C\u00e6sar, of course the favourite of the people, was in the immediate prospect of attaining a similar height of dominion. In this, however, he found a formidable competitor in Octavius, the grand-nephew and the adopted heir of C\u00e6sar, who at this critical moment arrived in Rome. Availing himself of these titles, Octavius gained"], [227, "SECT. 34. ANCIENT HISTORY. 199 the senate to his interest, and divided with Antony the favour of the people. The rivals soon perceived that it was their wisest plan to unite their interests ; and they admitted Lepidus into their association, whose power, as governor of Gaul, and immense riches, gave him a title to a share of authority. Thus was formed the second Triumvirate, the effects of whose union were beyond measure dreadful to the republic. The Triumviri divided among themselves the provinces, and cemented their union by a deli berate sacrifice made by each of his best friends to the vengeance of his associates. Antony consigned to death his uncle Lucius, Lepidus his brother Paulus, and Octavius his guardian Toranius, and his friend Cicero. In this horrible proscription 300 senators and 3000 knights were put to death. [Cicero fell by the hand of Popillius L\u00e6nas, whom he had successfully de fended in a cause which affected his life. He died with dignity, weary of the corrupt times in which he lived, having completed his sixty-third year.] 9. Octavius and Antony now marched against the conspirators, who had a formidable army in the field in Thrace, commanded by Brutus and Cassius. An engagement ensued at Philippi, which decided the fate of the empire. Antony o 4"], [228, "200 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. was victorious, for Octavius had no military talents : he was destitute even of personal bravery ; and his conduct after the victory was stained with that cruelty which is ever the at tendant of cowardice. Brutus and Cassius escaped the vengeance of their enemies by a voluntary death. Antony now sought a recom pence for his troops by the plunder of the East. While in Cilicia, he summond Cleopatra to answer for her conduct in dethroning an infant brother, and in openly favouring the party of Brutus and Cassius. The queen came so Tarsus, and made a complete conquest of the Triumvir. Immersed in luxury, and intoxicated with love, he forgot glory, ambition, fame, and every thing for Cleopatra ; and Octavius saw this phrenzy with delight, as the preparative of his rival's ruin. He had nothing to dread from Lepidus, whose insignificant character first drew on him the contempt of his partisans ; and whose folly, in attempting an invasion of the province of his colleague, was punished by his deposition and banishment. 10. Antony had in his madness lavished the provinces of the empire in gifts to his paramour and her children. The Roman people were justly indignant at these enormities; and the"], [229, "SECT. 34. ANCIENT HISTORY. 201 divorce of his wife Octavia, the sister of his colleague, was at length the signal of declared hostility between them. An immense arma ment, chiefly naval, came to a decisive conflict near Actium, on the coast of Epirus. Cleopatra, who attended her lover, deserted him with her galleys in the heat of the engagement; and such was the infatuation of Antony, that he abandoned his fleet, and followed her. After a contest of some hours, they yielded to the squadron of Octavius, A.U.C. 723, B.C. 31. The victor pursued the fugitives to Egypt ; and the base Cleopatra proffered terms to Octavius, including the surrender of her kingdom, and the abandonment of Antony. After an unsuccessful attempt at resistance, he anticipated his fate by falling on his sword. And Cleopatra soon after, either from remorse, or, more probably, from mor tified ambition, as she found it was Octavius's design to lead her in chains to Rome to grace his triumph, had courage to follow the example of her lover, and put herself to death by the poison of an asp. \u2014 Octavius returned to Rome, sole master of the Roman empire, A. U. C. 727, B. C. 25."], [230, "202 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. XXXV. CONSIDERATIONS ON SUCH PARTICULARS AS MARK THE GENIUS AND NATIONAL CHARACTER OF THE ROMANS. SYSTEM OF ROMAN EDUCATION. 1. A virtuous but rigid severity of manners was the characteristic of the Romans under their kings, and in the first ages of the republic. The private life of the citizens, frugal, temperate, and laborious, had its influence on their public character. The patria potestas gave to every head of a family a sovereign authority over all the members that composed it ; and this power, felt as a right of nature, was never abused. Plutarch has remarked, as a defect of the Roman laws, that they did not prescribe, as those of Laced\u00e6mon, a system and rules for the educa tion of youth. But the truth is, the manners of the people supplied this want. The utmost at tention was bestowed in the early formation of the mind and character. The excellent author of the dialogue De Oratoribus (whether Quin tilian or Tacitus) presents a valuable picture of"], [231, "SECT. 35. 203 ANCIENT HISTORY. the Roman education in the early ages of the commonwealth, contrasted with the less virtuous practice of the more refined. The Roman matrons did not abandon their infants to mer cenary nurses. They esteemed those duties sacred, and regarded the careful nurture of their offspring, the rudiments of their education, and the necessary occupations of their household, as the highest points of female merit. Next to the care bestowed in the instilment of virtuous morals, a remarkable degree of attention seems to have been given to the language of children, and to the attainment of a correctness and purity of expression. Cicero informs us, that the Gracchi, the sons of Cornelia, were educated non tarn in gr\u00e6mio quam in sermone matris. That urbanity which characterised the Roman citizens showed itself particularly in their speech and gesture. 2. The attention to the language of the youth had another source. It was by eloquence, more than by any other talent, that the young Roman could rise to the highest offices and dignities of the state. The studiaforensia were, therefore, a principal object of the Roman education. Plutarch informs us, that among the sports of the children at Rome one was the pleading"], [232, "204 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. causes before a mock tribunal, and accusing and defending a criminal in the usual forms of judi cial procedure. 3. The exercises of the body were likewise particularly attended to; whatever might harden the temperament, and confer strength and agi lity. These exercises were daily practised by the youth, under the eye of their elders, in the Campus Martius. 4. At seventeen the youth assumed the manly robe. He was consigned to the care of a mas ter of rhetoric, whom he attended constantly to the forum, or to the courts of justice; for, to be an accomplished gentleman, it was necessary for a Roman to be an accomplished orator. The pains bestowed on the attainment of this charac ter, and the best instructions for its acquisition, we learn from the writings of Cicero, Quintilian, and the younger Pliny. XXXVI. OF THE PROGRESS OF LITERATURE AMONG THE ROMANS. 1. Before the intercourse with Greece, which took place after the Punic wars, the Roman peo-"], [233, "SECT. 36. ANCIENT HISTORY. 205 pie was utterly rude and illiterate. As among all nations the first appearance of the liter ary spirit is shown in poetical composition, the Roman warrior had probably, like the In dian or the Celtic, his war-songs which celebrated his triumphs in battle. Religion, likewise, em ploys the earliest poetry of most nations; and if a people subsists by agriculture, a plentiful harvest is celebrated in the rustic song of the husbandman. The Versus Fescennini men tioned by Livy were probably of the nature of poetical dialogue, or alternate verses sung by the labourers, in a strain of coarse merriment and raillery. This shows a dawning of the drama. 2. About the 390th year of Rome, on occa sion of a pestilence, Ludiones (drolls or stage dancers) were brought from Etruria, qui ad tibi cinis modos saltantes, haud indecoros motus more Tusco dabant. Livy tells us, that the Roman youth imitated these performances, and added to them rude and jocular verses, probably the Fes cennine dialogues. It was not, however, till the year 514 A. U. C. that the regular drama was introduced at Rome from Greece by Livius An dronicus. The earliest Roman plays were, therefore, we may presume, translations from the Greek."], [234, "206 PART 1. ANCIENT HISTORY. Post Punica bella quietus qu\u00e6rere cepit, Quid Sophocles, et Thespis, et \u00c6schylus utile ferrent. 3. Of the early Roman drama, Ennius was a great ornament, and from his time the art made rapid advancement. The comedies of Plautus, the contemporary of Ennius, with great strength and spirit of dialogue, display a considerable knowledge of human nature, and [though rather adapted to the taste of the lower orders, from their indelicacy, yet, owing to the purity of the Latin in which they are written, they] are read at this day with pleasure : [many passages, indeed, are to be found in them favourable not only to morality but religion]. 4. C\u00e6cilius improved so much on the comedy of Plautus, that he is mentioned by Cicero as perhaps the best of the Roman comic writers. Of his compositions we have no remains. His patronage fostered the rising genius of Terence, whose first comedy, the Andria, was performed A. U. C. 587. The merit of the comedies of Terence lies in that nature and simplicity which are observable alike in the structure of his fables, in the delineation of his characters, and in the delicacy and purity of the sentiments of his pieces [the subjects, however, not being always"], [235, "SECT. 36. ANCIENT HISTORY'. 207 so unexceptionable as his language]. They are deficient in comic energy ; and are not calcu lated to excite ludicrous emotions. [Being, as well as those of Plautus,] chiefly borrowed from the Greek of Menander and Apollodorus [they furnish no description of Roman manners]. 5. The Roman comedy was of four different species ; the Com\u0153dia Togata or Pr\u00e6textata, the Com\u0153dia Tabernaria, the Attellan\u00e6, and the Mimi. The first admitted serious scenes and personages, and was of the nature of the modern sentimental comedy. The second was a repre sentation of ordinary life and manners. The Attellan\u00e6 were pieces where the dialogue was not committed to writing, but the subject of the scene was prescribed, and the dialogue filled up by the talents of the actors. The Mimi were pieces of comedy of the lowest species; farces, or entertainments of buffoonery ; though some times admitting the serious, and even the pa thetic. 6. The Roman tragedy kept pace in its ad vancement with the comedy. The best of the Roman tragic poets were Actius and Pacuvius, of whom we have no remains. The tragedies published under the name of Seneca are gene-"], [236, "208 ANCIENT HISTORY'. PART I. rally esteemed the work of different hands. They are none of them of superlative merit. 7. Velleius Paterculus remarks, that the \u00e6ra of the perfection of Roman literature was the age of Cicero ; comprehending all of the preced ing times whom Cicero might have seen, and all of the succeeding who might have seen him. Cicero, Quintilian, and Pliny, celebrate, in high terms, the writings of the elder Cato, whose prin cipal works were historical, and have entirely perished. We have his fragments, De Re Rus tica, in which he was imitated by Varro, one of the earliest of the good writers among the Ro mans, and a man of universal erudition. Of the variety of his talents we may judge, not only from the splendid eulogium of Cicero, but from the circumstance of Pliny having recourse to his authority in every book of his Natural History. 8. Sallust, in order of time, comes next to Varro. This writer introduced an important improvement on history, as treated by the Greek historians, by applying (as Dionysius of Hali carnassus says) the science of philosophy to the study of facts. Sallust is, therefore, to be con sidered as the father of philosophic history ; a species of writing which has been so successfully cultivated in modern times. He is an admir-"], [237, "SECT. 36. 209 ANCIENT HISTORY. able writer for the matter of his compositions, which evince great judgment and knowledge of human nature ; but by no means commendable for his style and manner of writing. He affects singularity of expression, an antiquated phrase ology, and a petulant brevity and sententiousness, which has nothing of the dignity of the histori cal style. 9. C\u00e6sar has much more purity of style, and more correctness and simplicity of expression ; but his Commentaries, wanting that amplitude of diction and fulness of illustration which is essen tial to history, are rather of the nature of annals. [The principal beauty of the Commentaries is, that they make us acquainted with the author : the force of his genius, the depth of his designs, and the extent and variety of his plans, are to be traced in almost every page.] 10. In all the requisites of an historian, Livy stands unrivalled among the Romans ; possess ing consummate judgment in the selection of facts, perspicuity of arrangement, sagacious re flection, sound views of policy, with the most copious, pure, and eloquent expression. It has been objected, that his speeches derogate from the truth of history ; but this was a prevalent taste with the ancient writers; and as those vol. i. p"], [238, "210 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. speeches are always known to be the composition of the historian, the reader is not deceived. [The prodigies he relates must also be referred to the circumstances of the times. The ancient world believed such things, and had not the means we have of judging properly of their utter incredibility.] As to the style of Livy, though in general excellent, we sometimes perceive in it, and most commonly in the speeches, an affec tation of the pointed sentences (the vibrantes sententiol\u0153) and obscurity of the declaimers, which evinces the pernicious influence acquired by those teachers at Rome since the time of Ci cero and Sallust. [It is truly melancholy to think, how small a portion of so great a work has escaped the ravages of time : but Velleius Paterculus affords us assistance, when we are compelled to relinquish Livy]. 11. In the decline of Roman literature, Taci tus is an historian of no common merit. He successfully cultivated the method pointed out by Sallust, of applying philosophy to history. In this he displays great knowledge of human nature, and penetrates, with singular acuteness, into the secret springs of policy, and the motives of actions. But his fault is, that he is too much of a politician, drawing his characters after the"], [239, "SECT. 36. ANCIENT HISTORY. 211 model of his own mind ; ever assigning actions and events to preconceived scheme and design, and allowing too little for the operation of acci dental causes, which often have the greatest in fluence on human affairs. Tacitus, in his style, professedly imitated that of Sallust; adopting all the ancient phraseology, as well as the new idioms introduced into the Roman language by that writer. To his brevity and abruptness he addgd most of the faults of the declaiming school. His expression, therefore, though ex tremely forcible, is often enigmatically obscure ; the very worst property that style can possess. 12. Among the eminent Roman poets (after the dramatic) Lucretius deserves first to be no ticed. He has great inequality, being at some times verbose, rugged, and perplexed, and at others displaying all the elegance as well as the fire of poetry. This may be in great part attri buted to his subject. Philosophical disquisition is unsuitable to poetry. It demands a dry pre cision of thought and expression, rejecting all excursive fancy and ornament of diction. That luxuriance of imagery, which is the soul of poetry, is raving and impertinence when ap plied to philosophy. [His celebrated poem founded on the precepts of Epicurus, was un- p 2"], [240, "212 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. doubtedly calculated to produce a gloomy scep ticism in regard to some of the first principles of religion, whether natural or revealed ; but in declaiming against various disorders and passions of the human mind he appears the friend of virtue.] IS. Catullus, the contemporary of Lucretius, is the earliest of the Roman lyric poets. His Epigrams are pointed and satirical, but too licentious; [the common fault of the times;] his Idyllia tender, natural, and picturesque. He flourished in the age of Julius C\u00e6sar. [He was the countryman and friend of Cornelius Nepos.] 14. In the succeeding age of Augustus, poetry attained to its highest elevation among the Romans. Virgil, Horace, Ovid, and Tibullus, were all contemporaries. Virgil is allowed the same rank among the Roman poets as Homer among the Greek. If Homer excels him in the sublime, he surpasses the Greek in the tender and the elegant. The transcendant merits of Homer are sullied by occasional defects ; Virgil is the model of a correct taste. The difference of manner in the Bucolics, the Georgics, and the \u00c6neid, shows that Virgil was capable of excelling in various departments of poetry ; and such is the opinion of Martial, who affirms, that"], [241, "SECT. 36. 213 ANCIENT HISTORY'. he could have surpassed Horace in Lyric Poetry, and Varius in Tragedy. 15. Horace excels as a Lyric poet, a satirist, and a critic. In his Odes there is more variety than in those of either Anacreon or Pindar; and he can alternately display the sublimity of the one, and the jocose vein of the other. His Satiresjiave that characteristic slyness and obli quity of censure, associated with humour and pleasantry, which strongly distinguish them from the stern and cutting sarcasm of Juvenal. [Horace, indeed, though a satirist of no common stamp, seems to have possessed a degree of candour and equity, which rendered him indul gent towards human frailties.] As a critic, his rules are taken chiefly from Aristotle ; but they contain the elements of a just taste in poetical composition, and therefore do not admit of variation. [Though he often writes as if he were a votary of Epicurus, we may easily collect from other parts of his works that he was not insen sible to the attractions of a severer philosophy.] The Satires of Juvenal, compared with those of Horace, are deficient in facetiousness and urbanity ; but they are superior in acuteness of thought, and in manly vigour of sentiment p 3"], [242, "214 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. . 16. In variety of talent, without supreme excellence, and ease and elegance of numbers, no Roman poet has excelled Ovid. In his Metamorphoses particularly, with great fancy, we have specimens of the pathetic, the descrip tive, the eloquent, and even the sublime. [The mythological stories they contain render them useful and instructive, while in the remains of his Fasti, or calendary verses, we find much that tends to illustrate and explain the religious rites, festivals, and sacrifices of the ancient Romans, and even to throw a considerable light on various ceremonies and observances of the present day.] His elegies have more of nature and of real passion than those of either Tibullus or Pro pertius. His amatory verses have much ten derness, but are too frequently loose, and even grossly licentious. 17. There is nothing more elegant than the compositions of Tibullus, nothing more delicate than the turn of his expression ; but it is not the language of passion. The sentiments are tender, but their power of affecting the heart is weakened by the visible care and solicitude of the poet for refined phraseology and polished numbers ; nor is there either much fancy or variety of thought."], [243, "SECT. 36. ANCIENT HISTORY. 215 A single elegy exhibits the sentiments of the whole. 18. Martial is the last of the Roman poets who can be mentioned with high approbation. His Epigrams, independent of their art and ingenuity, are valuable, as throwing light upon the Roman manners. He possesses, above every other poet, a naivete of expression, which is chiefly observable in his serious Epigrams. He is well characterised by the younger Pliny, in geniosus, acer, et qui in scribendo et salis haberet etfellis, nee candor is minus. Epist. iii. 21. 19. Luxuriance of ornament, and the fond ness for point, and brilliancy of thought and ex pression, are certain indications of the decline of good taste. These characters strongly mark the Latin poets of the succeeding ages. Lucan has some scattered examples of genuine poetic imagery, and Persius some happy strokes of animated satire ; but they scarcely compensate the affected obscurity of the one and the bombast of the other. The succeeding poets, Statius, Silius-Italicus, and Valerius Flaccus, in their at tempts at the most difficult of all species of poetry, the Epic, have only more signally dis played the inferiority of their genius, and the manifest decay of the art. p 4"], [244, "216 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. XXXVII. STATE OF PHILOSOPHY AMONG THE ROMANS. 1. The Romans, in the earlier periods of the republic, had little leisure to bestow on the cul tivation of the sciences, and had no idea of philo sophical speculation. It was not till the end of the sixth century from the building of the city, and in the interval between the war with Perseus and the third Punic war, that philosophy made its first appearance at Rome. A few learned Ach\u00e6ans, banished from their country, had settled in various parts of Italy, and, applying themselves to the cultivation of literature and the education of youth, diffused a taste for those studies hitherto unknown to the Romans. The elder citizens regarded these pursuits with an unfavourable eye. Jealous of the introduction of foreign manners with foreign studies, the senate banished the Greek philosophers from Rome. But an Athenian embassy arriving soon after, brought thither Carneades and Critolaus, who revived the taste for the Greek philosophy, and left behind them many able disciples, who publicly taught their doctrines."], [245, "SECT. 37. ANCIENT HISTORY. 217 2. It was natural that those symptoms should be most generally adopted which were most suitable to the national character. While the manners of the Romans had yet a tincture of ancient severity, the Stoical system prevailed. Scipio, L\u00e6lius, and the younger Cato, rank among its chief partisans. 3. The philosophy of Aristotle was little known in Rome till the age of Cicero. Cratippus and Tyrannion then taught his system with great reputation. Yet Cicero complains that the Peri patetic philosophy was little understood at Rome ; and, on that account, he sent his son to study its doctrines in the schools of Athens. 4. Lucullus, whose stay in Greece gave him an opportunity of being acquainted with all the different sects, disseminated, on his return to Rome, a very general taste for philosophy. His patronage of learned men, and his liberality in allowing his library to be open for the public use, contributed greatly to the promotion of literature. 5. The Old and New Academy had each their partisans. Of the former, which may be termed the Stoico-Platonic, the most illustrious disciples were Marcus Brutus and Terentius Varro. To the philosophical talents of Brutus, and the universal erudition of Varro, [of whose"], [246, "218 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. literary productions so few have been preserved,] the writings of Cicero bear the most ample testimony. Cicero himself must be deemed the most eminent of all the Roman philosophers. He is classed among the principal supporters of the New Academy ; though it seems rather to have been his purpose to elucidate the Greek phi losophy in general, than to rank himself among the disciples of any particular sect. 6. The cultivation of Physics, or Natural Philosophy, seems to have been little attended to either by the Greeks or Romans. Unless Agriculture should be classed under this descrip tion, we know of no Roman authors, except Varro and the elder Pliny, who seem to have bestowed much attention on the operations of nature. The works of the former have perished, except a few fragments ; but the Natural History of Pliny is a most valuable storehouse of the knowledge of the ancients in Physics, \u0152cono mics, and the Arts and Sciences. It is to be regretted that the style is unsuitable to the matter, being too frequently florid, declamatory, and obscure. [Western Europe, indeed, stands practically indebted to Rome for the introduc tion of many common fruits, and culinary plants, which in the course of her conquests in the East she was careful to collect, and transfer to Italy ;"], [247, "SECT. 38. ANCIENT HISTORY. 219 such as apples, pears, cherries, and, in all likeli hood, the olive, so much esteemed in France, Spain, and all the southern parts of the Con tinent.] 7- The philosophy of Epicurus was unknown in the early ages of the Roman commonwealth. It was introduced with luxury, and kept pace in its advancement with the corruption of man ners. Cineas having discoursed on the tenets of Epicurus at the table of Pyrrhus, Fabricius exclaimed, May the enemies of Rome ever entertain such principles ! Yet these principles were, in a short time from that period, but too current among her own citizens. XXXVIII. OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MANNERS OF THE ROMANS. 1. The manners of the Romans in the early ages of the republic were so different from those of the latter times, that one should be led to suppose some very extraordinary causes to have co-operated to produce so remarkable a change: yet the transition is easy to be ac-"], [248, "220 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. counted for. A spirit of temperance, of fru gality, and probity, is the characteristic of every infant establishment. A virtuous simplicity of manners, and a rigour of military discipline, paved the way for the extension of the Roman arms, and for their prodigious conquests : these conquests introduced wealth, luxury, and cor ruption. 2. In the early times, the patricians, when in the country, forgot the distinction of ranks, and laboured in the cultivation of their fields like the meanest plebeians. We have the examples of Cincinnatus, Curius, the elder Cato, and Scipio Africanus. [The very names of some of the most distinguished families, as the Lentuli, Piso nes, Fabii, &c, are supposed to have been as sumed, expressly to mark the skill and success of the bearers of them in the cultivation of par ticular vegetables. It was accounted more no ble to belong to one of the thirty-one rustic, than to either of the four city tribes.] The town was visited only every ninth or market-day. In those times of virtuous simplicity, says Sal lust, Domi militi\u00e6que boni mores colebantur. \u2014 Duabus artibus, audacia in bello, ubi pax evene rat, \u0153quitate, seque remque publicam curabant. But when, in consequence of this very disci-"], [249, "SECT. 38. ANCIENT HISTORY. 221 pline, and these manners, the Romans had ex tended their dominion, they imported with the wealth of the conquered nations their tastes, their manners, and their vices. 3. The Romans had no natural taste in the fine arts. On the conquest of Greece, an im mense field opened at once to their eyes, and the masterpieces of art poured in upon them in abundance. But their excellences they could not appreciate. The Roman luxury, so far as the arts were concerned, was in general displayed in an awkward, heavy, and tasteless magnifi cence. [From the regal to the imperial govern ment, the greatest persons appear to have worn clothes prepared by their wives and daughters. The robes made by Queen Tanaquil for the first Tarquin, were preserved in the time of the C\u00e6 sars, and Augustus wore dresses prepared by the hand of Livia.] 4. The public and private life of the Romans will be best elucidated by a short account of the manner in which the day was passed at Rome, both by the higher and lower ranks of the peo ple. The morning hours were spent by a part of the citizens in visiting the temples; by others, in attending the levees of the great. The Clien tes waited on their Patroni; the patricians vi-"], [250, "222 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. sited each other, or paid their compliments to the leaders of the republic. Popularity was al ways the first object of ambition at Rome, as paving the way to all advancement. From the levee they proceeded to the forum, either to as sist in the public business, or for amusement. There the time was spent till noon, the hour of dinner among the Romans, chiefly a very light repast, and of which it was not customary to invite any guests to partake. After dinner the youth repaired to the Campus Martius, where they occupied themselves in athletic exercises and sports till sunset. The elder class retired for an hour to repose, and then passed the after noon in their porticoes, galleries, or libraries, where they enjoyed the conversation of their friends, or heard recitations of literary works: [even while they were in the baths they had persons to read to them :] others repaired to the theatres, or to the shows of the circus and am phitheatre. 5. Combats of gladiators were introduced for the first time about the 490th year of the city, and soon became a most favourite amusement, as did the combats with wild beasts. The spi rit of luxury, which in general is not unfavour able to humanity, showed its progress among the"], [251, "SECT. 38. 223 ANCIENT HISTORY. Romans by an increasing ferocity and inhuma nity of the public spectacles. Theatrical enter tainments were in high request. (See supra, Sect. XXXVI. \u00a7 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.) The taste for pantomime came to such a height, that the art was taught in public schools, and the nobility and people were divided into parties in favour of the rival performers : an abuse which called at length for the interposition of the laws. 6. From the porticoes, or from the theatre and amphitheatre, it was customary to go to the baths, of which there were many for the use of the public, while the rich had them in their own houses, vying with each other in this as in every other article of luxury or magnificence. From the bath they went immediately to supper, gene rally about the ninth or tenth hour, counting from sunrise. At table they reclined on couches. The luxury of the Roman suppers far exceeded every thing known among the moderns. An antec\u0153nium of pickles and spices was presented to prepare and sharpen the appetite. Cookery became a science. The number and costliness of the dishes were incredible. The entertain ment was heightened by every thing gratifying to the senses ; by male and female dancers, musi cians, pantomimes, and even shows of gladiators."], [252, "224 PART 1. ANCIENT HISTORY. 7. In the end of the republic, pleasure and amusement were the darling objects of all ranks of the citizens : they sought no more than panem et circenses. XXXIX. OF THE ART OF WAR AMONG THE ROMANS. 1. From the prodigious success which attended the arms of the Romans, and that dominion they acquired over the greatest part of the known world, it seems a natural inference, that they must have carried the military art to a higher degree of perfection than any other of the con temporary nations. Vegetius expressly assigns their extensive conquests to that cause alone. It is the discipline of an army that makes the multitude act as one man. It likewise increases the courage of troops ; for each individual con fides in the steady co-operation of his fellows. 2. From the constant practice of athletic exer cises, the Romans were inured from infancy to hardiness and fatigue, and bred to that species of life which a soldier leads in the most active campaign in the field."], [253, "SECT. 39. ANCIENT HISTORY. 225 3. The levies were made annually, by the tribes called out, and divided into their respective num ber of centuries^ each century presenting by rotation as many soldiers as there were legions intended to be raised ; and the tribunes of the several legions taking their turn by rotation in the selection of the men presented by the cen turies. (See supra, Sect. XXIV. \u00a7 16.) The number of soldiers in the legion was various at different periods, from 3000 tolO.OOO and 1 1,000. [The term Legion, it may be well to observe, implied selection ; among the disqualifications, poverty being accounted an insuperable one, it not being judged expedient or safe to intrust the fate of the community to persons who had nothing to lose.] 4. Among the ancient nations there were usually but two different arrangements of the troops in order of battle. The one the Phalanx, or close arrangement in parallelogram, inter- sected only by great divisions ; a disposition commonly used by the Greeks and by most of the barbarous nations. The other the Quincunx, or Chequer, consisting of small companies or platoons, disposed in three straight lines, with alternate spaces between them equal to the space occupied by each company. In the first line vol. 1. \u00ab"], [254, "226 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. were the Hastati, in the second, the Principes, and in the third, the Triarii. On the flanks of the first line were the cavalry, likewise in de tached companies ; and in front of the line were the Velites, or light-armed troops, who usually began by a skirmishing attack, and then were withdrawn to make way for the main body to come into action. The arms of the legion were, for the hastati and principes, the pilum or heavy javelin, and the sword and buckler ; and for the triarii, the long spear, with the sword and buckler. The advantages of this arrangement were, that the line of battle could be three times formed with fresh troops, and that it was more fitted than any other for rapid changes of move ment. [From the spear of the triarii, the Romans are supposed to have acquired their ap pellation Quirites, it being a weapon adopted from the Sabines, and in their language called Quiris, according to the following line of Ovid : **** Sive quod hasta Quiris priscis est dicta Sabinis.\" Fast, ii.] 5. Notwithstanding these advantages, the quin cunx went into disuse towards the end of the republic, and from that time various arrange ments of the legion were used according to 10*"], [255, "SECT. 39. 227 ANCIENT HISTORY'. circumstances. The tactic of the Romans is supposed to have been at its greatest pitch of excellence during the Punic wars. Hannibal was a great master of the science, and the Romans profited by the experience of his ability. The battle of Cann\u00e6, as described by Polybius, affords signal evidence of the great talents of the Carthaginian general. That description has been misrepresented by Folard, but is accu rately explained in the Memoires Militaires of M. Guischardt, [the Quintus Icilius of Frederic the Second of Prussia]. Had the quincunx disposition been kept by the Roman army in that engagement, the event might have been very different, as it would have disappointed the effect of an artful man\u0153uvre planned by Han nibal, on observing his enemy's army arranged in the unusual order of the phalanx. [The Cuneus and Forceps were among the most curious arrangements, the former being in the form of a wedge, which, by being ably directed against any weak part of the enemies' forces, was sure to penetrate the ranks with irresistible force. To counteract such operations the forceps was invented, which, by suddenly opening to receive the wedge, and then closing upon it, committed the greatest slaughter, the cuneus Q 9"], [256, "228 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. being from its form incapable of any retrograde movement.] 6. The art of intrenchment was carried to great perfection by the Romans, particularly by Julius C\u00e6sar. With 60,000 men he defended himself in his intrenchments before Alexia, while the lines of circumvallation were attacked by 242,000 Gauls, and the lines of countervallation by 80,000 without effect. These intrenchments consisted of a ditch from nine to fifteen feet in depth and width, fenced on the inside by the mound of excavated earth, and on the outside by strong stakes with pointed branches. 7. In besieging a town, several camps were formed around the place, joined to each other by lines of circumvallation and countervallation. A mound of earth (agger) was raised, beginning by a gentle slope from one of the camps, and gradually rising in elevation as it approached the city. The front, where the workmen were em- ployed, was defended by a curtain of hides fixed on strong posts. On this mound the engines of attack, Catapult\u0153 for the discharge of heavy stones, and Balist\u00e6 for arrows, were advanced, till they played on the very spot which the be siegers wished to assail. The same machines were used by the besieged for annoying the *8"], [257, "SECT. 39- 229 ANCIENT HISTORY. enemy. When the batteries from the terrace had silenced those on the walls, the battering ram (aries) was then brought up under a pent house (testudo), and, if it once reached the wall, was generally decisive of the fate of the town. The main object of the besieged was, therefore, to prevent its approach by every power of an noyance. Stones, darts, and combustible mat ters, were continually launched upon the assail ants; and sometimes a mine was dug from the city to scoop away the terrace and all its en gines. \u2014 These arts of attack and defence of for tified places were in general use among the na tions of antiquity, and continued down to modern times, till the invention of gunpowder. 8. The naval military art was utterly unknown among the Romans till the first Punic war. A Carthaginian galley was the first model; and in the space of two months they equipped a fleet of 100 gallies of five banks of oars, and 20 of three banks. The structure of these gallies, and the mode of arranging the rowers, may be learned from the ancient sculptures and medals ; [but there was more difficulty in making mariners than ships : they were obliged to learn the art of navigation on shore, as it were, and to adopt such a mode of warfare as enabled them to fight, Q 3"], [258, "230 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. indeed, but more like soldiers than sailors]. The combatants at sea assailed at a distance with javelins, missile combustibles, and some times with catapult\u00e6 and balist\u0153 ; but the serious attack was made in boarding, when the vessels grappled together by means of a crane let down from the prow. 9. In the times of the empire, the Romans maintained their distant conquests, not only by their armies, but by their fleets, which were moored in the large rivers and bays, and gene rally preserved a fixed station, as did the legions. XL. REFLECTIONS ARISING FROM A VIEW OF THE ROMAN HISTORY DURING THE COMMONWEALTH. 1. The history of all nations evinces that there is an inseparable connection between the morals of a people and their political prosperity. But we have no stronger demonstration of this truth than the annals of the Roman commonwealth. To limit to republics alone the necessity of vir tue as a principle, is a chimerical notion fraught"], [259, "SECT. 40. ANCIENT HISTORY. 231 with dangerous consequences. Quid leges sine moribus van\u00e6 prqficiunt, is a sentiment equally applicable to all governments whatever; and no political system, however excellent its fabric, can possess any measure of duration, without that powerful cement, virtue, in the principles and manners of the people. (Supra, Sect. XIX. \u00a7 4.) 2. The love of our country, and the desire for its rational liberty, are noble and virtuous feelings, and their prevalence is ever a test of the integrity of the national morals. But there is no term which has been more prostituted than the word liberty. Among a corrupted people, the cry for liberty is heard the loudest among the most profligate of the community. With these its meaning has no relation to patriotism ; it imports no more than the aversion to restraint; and the personal character of the demagogue, and the private morals of his disciples, are al ways sufficient to unmask the counterfeit. The spirit of patriotism and a general corruption of manners cannot possibly be co-existent in the same age and nation. 3. On the other hand, while the morals of a people are pure, no public misfortune is irre trievable, nor any political situation so desperate, that hope may not remain of a favourable o. 4"], [260, "232 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. change. In such a crisis, the spirit of patriot ism pervading all ranks of the state will soon recover the national prosperity. The history of the Roman people, and that of the Grecian states, in various crises, both of honour and of disgrace, afford proof's alike of this position and of its converse. 4. The national character of the Romans seems to have undergone its most remarkable change for the worse, from the time of the de struction of their rival Carthage. Sallust assigns the cause : Ante Carthaginem deletam, me tus hostilis in bonis artibus civitatem retinebat. Sed ubi ilia formido mentibus decessit, scilicet qa qu\u0153 secund\u0153 res amant, lascivia atque superbia invasere. 5. In the last ages of the commonwealth, avarice and ambition, unrestrained by moral principle, were the chief motives of the Roman conquests. It was sufficient reason for going to war, that a country offeied a tempting object to the rapacity and ambition of the military leaders. The conquest of Italy paved the way for the re duction of foreign nations. Hence the Romans imported, with their wealth, the manners, the luxuries, and the vices of the nations they sub dued. The generals returned not as \u25a0 formerly,"], [261, "SECT. 40. 233 ANCIENT HISTORY. after a successful war, to the labours of the field, and to a life of temperance and industry. They were now the governors of kingdoms and pro vinces ; and at the period of their command abroad, disdaining the restraints of a subject, they could be satisfied with nothing less than so vereignty at home. The armies, debauched by the plunder of kingdoms, were completely dis posed to support them in all their schemes of ambition ; and the populace, won by corruption, always took part with the chief who best could pay for their favour and support. Force or bri bery over-ruled every election ; and the inhabi tants of distant states, now holding the rights of citizens, were brought to Rome at the command of the demagogue, to influence any popular con test, and turn the scale in his favour. In a go vernment thus irretrievably destroyed, by the decay of those springs which supported it, it was of little consequence by the hands of what parti cular tyrant, usurper, or demagogue, its ruin was finally accomplished. 6. From the consideration of the rise and fall of the principal states of antiquity, it has been a commonly received observation, that the consti tution of empires has, like the human body, a period of growth, maturity, decline, and extinc-"], [262, "PART I. 234 ANCIENT HISTORY. tion. But arguments from analogy are extremely deceiving, and particularly so when the analogy is from physical to moral truths. The human body is, from its fabric, naturally subject to de- cay, and is perpetually undergoing a change from time. The organs, at first weak, attain gra- dually their perfect strength, and thence, by a similar gradation, proceed to decay and dissolu- tion. This is an immutable law of its nature. But the springs of the body-politic do not necessarily undergo a perpetual change from time. It is not regularly progressive from weakness to strength, and thence to decay and dissolution ; nor is it under the influence of any principle of corruption which may not be checked, and even eradicated by wholesome laws. Thus, the beginning of the corruption of Sparta is attributed to the breach by Lysander of the institutions of Lycurgus, in introducing gold into the treasury of the state instead of her iron money. But was this a ne cessary or an unavoidable measure ? Perhaps a single vote in the senate decreed its adoption, and therefore another suffrage might have saved or long postponed the downfall of the common wealth. The Roman republic owed its dissolu tion to the extension of its dominions. Had it been a capital crime for any Roman citizen to"], [263, "SECT. 40. ANCIENT HISTORY. 235 have proposed to carry the arms of the republic beyond the limits of Italy, its constitution might have been preserved for many ages beyond the period of its actual duration. \" Accustom your \" mind,\" said Phocion to Aristias, \" to discern, \" in the fate of nations, that recompence which \" the great Author of nature has annexed to the **} practice of virtue. No state ever ceased to \" be prosperous but in consequence of having \" departed from those institutions to which she \". owed her prosperity.\" History, indeed, has shown, that all states and empires have had their period of duration ; but history, instructing us in the causes which have produced their decline and downfall, inculcates also this salutary lesson, that they themselves are in general the masters of their destiny, and that all nations may, and most certainly ought to, aspire at immortality. 7. It was a great desideratum in ancient poli tics, that a government should possess within itself the power of periodical reformation ; a ca pacity of checking any overgrowth of authority in any of its branches, and of winding up the machine, or bringing back the constitution to its first principles. To the want of such a power in the states of antiquity, which was ineffectually endeavoured to be supplied by such partial con-"], [264, "236 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. trivances as the Ostracism and Petalism, we may certainly ascribe in no small degree the decay of those states ; for in their governments, when the balance was once destroyed, the evil grew worse from day to day, and admitted of no re medy but a revolution, or entire change of the system. \u2014 The British constitution possesses this inestimable advantage over all the govern ments both of ancient and of modern times. Besides the perpetual power of reform vested in parliament, the constitution may be purified of every abuse, and brought back to its first prin ciples, at the commencement of every reign. But of this we shall afterwards treat in its proper place. XLI. ROME UNDER THE EMPERORS. 1. The battle of Actium decided the fate of the commonwealth, and Octavius, now named Augustus, was master of the Roman empire. He possessed completely the sagacity of dis cerning what character was best fitted for gain ing the affections of the people he governed, and"], [265, "SECT. 41. ANCIENT HISTORY. 237 the versatility of temper and genius to assume it. His virtues, though the result of policy, not of nature, were certainly favourable to the hap piness, and even to the liberties, of his subjects. The fate of C\u00e6sar warned him of the insecurity of an usurped dominion ; and, therefore, while he studiously imitated the engaging manners and clemency of his great predecessor, he af fected a much higher degree of moderation and respect for the rights of the people. 2. The temple of Janus was shut, which had been open for 188 years, since the beginning of the second Punic war ; an event productive of universal joy. \" The Romans (says Condillac) \" now believed themselves a free people, since \" they had no longer to fight for their liberty.\" The sovereign kept up this delusion, by main taining the ancient forms of the republican con stitution, in the election of magistrates, &c, though they were nothing more than forms. He even pretended to consider his own function as merely a temporary administration for the pub lic benefit. Invested with the consulate and censorship, he went through the regular forms of periodical election to those offices; and at the end of the seventh year of his government actually announced to the senate his resigna-"], [266, "238 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. tion of all authority. The consequence was a general supplication of the senate and people, that he would not adandon the republic, which he had saved from destruction. \" Since it must \" be so, (said he,) I accept the empire for ten \" years, unless the public tranquillity should \" before that time permit me to enjoy that re \" tirement I passionately long for.\" He re peated the same mockery five times in the course of his government, accepting the administration sometimes for ten, and sometimes only for five years. 3. It was much to the credit of Augustus, that in the government of the empire he reposed un limited confidence in Mec\u00e6nas, a most able mi nister, who had sincerely at heart the interest and happiness of the people. It was by his ex cellent counsels that all public affairs were con ducted, and the most salutary laws enacted for the remedy of public grievances, and even the correction of the morals of the people. It was to his patronage that literature and the arts owed their encouragement and advancement. It was by his influence and wise instructions that Au gustus assumed those virtues to which his heart was a stranger, and which, in their tendency to"], [267, "SECT. 41. ANCIENT HISTORY. 239 the happiness of his subjects, were equally effec tual as if the genuine fruits of his nature. 4. On the death of Marcellus, the nephew and son-in-law of Augustus, (23 B. C.) a prince of great hopes, the Emperor bestowed his chief favour on Marcus Agrippa, giving him his daughter Julia, the widow of Marcellus, in mar riage. Agrippa had considerable military talents, and was successful in accomplishing the reduc tion of Spain, and subduing the revolted pro vinces of Asia. Augustus associated him with himself in the office of censor, and would pro bably have given him a share of the empire ; but the death of Agrippa occasioned a new arrangement. The daughter of Augustus now took for her third husband Tiberius, who became the son-in-law of the Emperor by a double tie, for Augustus had previously married his mother Livia. This artful woman, removing all of the imperial family who stood betwixt her and the object of ambition, thus made room for the suc cession of her son Tiberius, who, on his part, bent all his attention to gain the favour and con fidence of Augustus. On the return of Tiberius from a successful campaign against the Germans, the people were made to solicit the Emperor to confer on him the government of the provinces"], [268, "240 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. and the command of the armies. Augustus now gradually withdrew himself from the cares of empire. He died soon after at Nola in Cam pania, in the 76th year of his age, and 44th of his imperial reign, A. U. C. 767. and A. D. 14. [The empire at the time of his death may be said to have been bounded on the west by the Atlantic ocean, on the north by the Rhine and Danube, on the east by the Euphrates, and on the south by the deserts of Africa and Arabia. Roads issuing from the forum at Rome, in all directions, kept up a communication with the several provinces to an extent of 4000 miles.] 5. A considerable part of the lustre thrown on the reign of Augustus is owing to the splendid colouring bestowed on his character by the poets and other authors who adorned his court, and repaid his favours by their adulation. Assuredly other sovereigns of much higher merits have been less fortunate in obtaining the applause of posterity : Illacrymabiles Urgentur, ignotique longa Nocte, carent quia vate sacro. [6. He was the child of fortune, whose gifts were wasted upon him as far as regarded the"], [269, "SECT. 41. ANCIENT HISTORY. 241 empire he established. He availed himself very adroitly of the events and accidents which led to his own elevation, but he did little or nothing to advance the permanent interests of his people ; he very unfeelingly delivered them over to a successor of whose ill qualities he could not but be aware ; it has even been imputed to him by Tacitus, Suetonius, and Dion Cassius, that he adopted Tiberius expressly with the view, that when he himself should be removed by death, the remembrance of his own reign might be the more grateful and popular.] One great event distinguished the reign of Augustus, the birth of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which, ac cording to the best authorities, happened in the 754th year A. U. C, and four years before the vulgar date of the Christian \u00e6ra. * 7. Augustus had named Tiberius his heir, together with his mother Livia, and substi tuted to them Drusus, the son of Tiberius, and Germanicus. Tiberius was vicious, debauched, and cruel ; yet the very dread of his character operated in securing an easy succession to the empire. An embassy from the senate entreated * Vide Dr. Playfair's System of Chronology, p. 49, 50. ; a work of great research and accuracy, and by far the best on that subject. VOL. I. R"], [270, "242 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. him to accept the government, which he mo destly affected to decline, but suffered himself to be won by their supplications. Notwithstanding this symptom of moderation, it soon appeared that the power enjoyed by his predecessor was too limited for the ambition of Tiberius. It was not enough that the substance of the republic was gone, the very appearance of it was now to be demolished. The people were no longer as sembled, and the magistrates of the state were supplied by the imperial will. 8. Germanicus, the nephew of Tiberius, be came the object of his jealousy, from the glory he had acquired by his military exploits in Germany, and the high favour in which he stood with the Roman people. He was recalled in the midst of his successes, and dispatched to the oriental provinces, where he soon after died, as was generally believed, of poison, administered by the Emperor's command. 9. \u00c6lius Sejanus, pr\u00e6fect of the pr\u00e6torian guards, the favourite counsellor of Tiberius, and the obsequious minister of his tyranny and crimes, conceived the daring project of a revolution, which should place himself on the throne, by the extermination of the whole imperial family. Drusus, the son of the Emperor, was cut off by poison. Agrippina, the widow of Germanicus,"], [271, "SECT. 41. 243 ANCIENT HISTORY. with the elder of her sons, was banished, and the younger confined to prison. Tiberius himself was persuaded by Sejanus, under the pretence of the discovery of plots for his assassination, to retire from Rome to the Isle of Capre\u00e6, and devolve the government upon his faithful minister. But while Sejanus, thus far successful, meditated the last step to the accomplishment of his wishes, by the murder of his sovereign, his treason was detected ; and the Emperor dis patched his mandate to the senate, which was followed by his immediate sentence and execu tion. The public indignation was not satisfied with his death : the populace tore his body to pieces, and flung it into the Tiber. 10. Tiberius now became utterly negligent of the cares of government ; and the imperial power was displayed only in public executions, confis cations, and scenes of cruelty and rapine. At length the tyrant, falling sick, was strangled in his bed by Macro, the pr\u00e6fect of the pr\u00e6torian guards, in the 78th year of his age, and 23d of his reign. 11.

Tiberius had nominated for his heir Cali gula, the son of Germanicus, his grandson by adoption, and joined with him Tiberius, the son of Drusus, his grandson by blood. The former enjoyed, on his father's account, the favour of the people ; and the senate, to gratify them, set aside the right of his colleague, and conferred on him the empire undivided. The commence ment of his reign was signalised by a few acts of clemency and even good policy. He restored the privileges of the Comitia, [which had been suspended by his predecessor,] and abolished arbitrary prosecutions for crimes of state. But, tyrannical and cruel by nature, he substituted military execution for legal punishment. The provinces were loaded with the most oppressive [and before unheard of] taxes, and daily [cruel and capricious] confiscations [helped to] fill the imperial coffers. The follies and absurdities of Caligula were equal to his vices, [and were they not well attested, would exceed all belief]/ It is hard to say whether he was most the object of hatred or of contempt to his subjects. [But they submitted to him too long. Seneca's reflec tion, that nature seemed to have brought him forth, to show what was possible to be produced by the greatest vice supported by the greatest authority, is but a faint description of matters."], [273, "SECT. 41. ANCIENT HISTORY. 245 There was as much of insanity as vice in his pro ceedings ; and he should have been restrained. If it were mere vice, the agents, ministers, and executioners of his perverse will, the panders to his exorbitant passions, the abettors of his odious tyranny, were found amongst the people ; and his subjects must bear their share of the indignities heaped upon his memory: but Tacitus, perhaps, has justly accounted for their apathy and for bearance. Cuncta discordiis civilibus fessa sub imperium accepit (populus). Caligula, at length, however, as might have been expected,] perished by assassination in the 4th year of his reign, and 29th of his age, A.U.C. 794, A.D. 42. 13. Claudius, the uncle of Caligula, was sa luted Emperor by the pr\u00e6torian guards, who had been the murderers of his nephew. He was the son of Octavia, the sister of Augustus ; a man of weak intellects, and of no education ; yet his short reign was marked by an enterprise of importance. He undertook the reduction of Britain ; and, after visiting the island in person, [in the second year of his reign,] left his gene rals, Plautius and Vespasian, to prosecute a war which was carried on for several years with va rious success. The Silures, or inhabitants of South Wales, under their king Caractacus (Ca- r 3"], [274, "246 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I, radoc) made a brave resistance, but were finally defeated, and Caractacus led captive to Rome, where the magnanimity of his demeanour pro cured him respect and admiration. 14. The civil administration of Claudius was weak and contemptible. [Though, as was the case with the emperors who resembled him, the com mencement of his reign promised better things ; he executed certain public works of great utility, and with no small magnificence, such as the draining of the lake Fucinus, and turning its waters into the Tiber ; but more particularly his celebrated aqueduct, which bore his name, con veying water to the metropolis from the distance of 40 miles.] He [soon, however, became] the slave even of his domestics, and the dupe of his infamous wives, Messalina and Agrippina. The former, abandoned to the most shameful profli gacy, was at length put to death, on suspicion of treasonable designs. The latter, who was the daughter of Germanicus, bent her utmost endea vours to secure the succession to the empire to her son Domitius \u00c6nobarbus, and employed every engine of vice and inhumanity to remove the obstacles to the accomplishment of her wishes. Having, at length, prevailed on Clau dius to adopt her son, and confer on him the"], [275, "SECT. 42.

Claudius was put to death in the 15th year of his reign, and 63d of his age. XLII. 1. The son of Agrippina assumed the name of Nero Claudius. He had enjoyed the benefit of a good education under the philosopher Se neca, but reaped from his instructions no other fruit than a pedantic affectation of taste and learning, with no real pretension to either. While controlled by his tutor, Seneca, and by Burrhus, captain of the pr\u00e6torian guards, a man of worth and ability, Nero maintained for a short time a decency of public conduct ; but the re straint was intolerable, and nature soon broke out. His real character was a compound of every thing that is base and inhuman. In the murder of his mother Agrippina, he revenged the crime she had committed in raising him to the throne ; he rewarded the fidelity of Burrhus by poisoning him ; and as a last kindness to his r 4"], [276, "248 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. tutor Seneca, he allowed him to choose the mode of his death. It was his darling amusement to exhibit on the stage and amphitheatre, [not in Italy only, but in Greece,] as an actor, musi cian, or gladiator ; [so much to the annoyance, often, of his auditors and spectators, who were forbidden to depart till the exhibition was con cluded, that they had recourse to expedients, sometimes the most hazardous, at others the most absurd, to procure their earlier dismissal ; and yet such was the abject state of the world at that period, that he is reported to have re ceived not less than eighteen hundred crowns, and most of them at the Isthmian, Nemean, and Pythian games]. At length become the object of universal hatred and contempt, a rebellion of his subjects, headed by Vindex, an illustrious Gaul, hurled this monster from the throne. He had not courage to attempt resistance, [and he knew not how to die, till] a slave, at his own re quest, dispatched him with a dagger. Nero pe rished in the 30th year of his age, after a reign of fourteen years, A. D. 69. 2. Galba, the successor of Nero, was of an ancient and illustrious family. He was in the 73d year of his age when the senate, ratifying the choice of the pr\u00e6torian bands, proclaimed"], [277, "SECT. 42. 249 ANCIENT HISTORY. him Emperor. But an impolitic rigour of dis cipline soon disgusted the army : the avarice of his disposition, grudging the populace their fa vourite games and spectacles, deprived him of their affections ; and some iniquitous prosecu tions and confiscations excited general discon tent and mutiny. Galba adopted and designed for his successor the able and virtuous Piso, a measure which excited the jealously of Otho, his former favourite, and led him to form the daring plan of raising himself to the throne by the destruction of both. He found the pr\u00e6to rians apt to his purpose : they proclaimed him Emperor, and presented him, as a grateful offer ing, the heads of Galba and Piso, who were slain in quelling the insurrection. Galba had reigned seven months, Major privato visus (says Tacitus) dum privatus suit, et omnium consensu capax imperii, nisi imperasset. 3. Otho had a formidable rival in Vitellius, who had been proclaimed Emperor by his army in Germany. It is hard to say which of the competitors was, in point of abilities, the more despicable, or in character the more infamous. A decisive battle was fought at Bedriacum, near Mantua, where the army of Otho was defeated, and their commander, in a fit of despair, ended"], [278, "250 ANCIENT HISTORY.

[Had his reign been pro longed, we cannot pretend to say, what sort of a sovereign he might have become, but during the very short time he acted as Emperor, he appears to have manifested a much better disposition, and to have displayed more virtues, than from his conduct as a private person he could have been supposed to possess.] 4. The reign of Vitellius was of eight months' duration. He is said to have proposed Nero for his model, and it was just that he should resemble him in his fate. Vespasian, who had obtained from Nero the charge of the war against the Jews, which he had conducted with ability and success, was proclaimed Emperor by his troops in the East ; and a great part of Italy submitting to his generals, Vitellius meanly ca pitulated to save his life by a resignation of the empire. The people, indignant at his dastardly spirit, compelled him to an effort of resistance ; but the attempt was fruitless. Priscus, one of the generals of Vespasian, took possession of Rome, and Vitellius was massacred, and his body flung into the Tiber. 5. Vespasian, though of mean descent, was worthy of the empire, and reigned with high"], [279, "SECT. 42. ANCIENT HISTORY. 251 popularity for ten years. He possessed great clemency of disposition ; his manners were af fable and engaging, and his mode of life was characterised by simplicity and frugality. He respected the ancient forms of the constitution, restored the senate to its deliberative rights, and acted by its authority in the administration of all public affairs. The only blemish in his character was a tincture of avarice, and even that is greatly extenuated by the laudable and patriotic use which he made of his revenues. \u2014 Under his reign, and by the arms of his son Titus, was terminated the war against the Jews. They had been brought under the yoke of Rome by Pompey, who took Jerusalem. Under Augustus they were governed for some time by Herod as viceroy ; but the tyranny of his son Archelaus was the cause of his banishment, and the reduction of Judea into the ordinary condi tion of a Roman province. Rebelling on every slight occasion, Nero had sent Vespasian to re duce them to order; and he had just prepared for the siege of Jerusalem, when he was called to Rome to assume the government of the em pire. Titus wished to spare the city, and tried every means to prevail on the Jews to surrender : but in vain ; their ruin was decreed by Heaven."], [280, "252 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. After an obstinate blockade of six months, Jeru salem was taken by storm, the Temple burnt to ashes, and the city buried in ruins. \u2014 The Ro man empire was now in profound peace. Ves pasian associated Titus in the imperial dignity, and soon after died, universally lamented, at the age of sixty-nine, A. D. 79. 6. The character of Titus was humane, mu nificent, dignified, and splendid. His short reign was a period of great happiness and prosperity to the empire, and his goverment a constant ex ample of virtue, justice, and beneficence. In his time happened that dreadful eruption of Ve suvius which overwhelmed the cities of Hercu laneum and Pompeii ; and the public losses from these calamities he repaired by the sacrifice of his fortune and revenues. He died in the third year of his reign, and fortieth of his age ; ever to be remembered by that most exalted epithet, Delici\u00e6 humani generis. 7. Domitian, the brother of Titus, and sus pected of murdering him by poison, succeeded to the empire, A. D. 81. He was a vicious and inhuman tyrant. A rebellion in Germany gave him occasion to signalise the barbarity of his disposition ; and its consequences were long felt in the sanguinary punishments inflicted under"], [281, "SECT. 42.

[His assumption of the cognomen Germanicus was no better than a burlesque upon himself, as intimating a victory over persons whom in reality he never had sub dued.] The prodigal and voluptuous spirit of this reign was a singular contrast to its tyranny and inhumanity. The people were loaded with insupportable taxes to furnish spectacles and games for their amusement. The successes of Agricola in Britain threw a lustre on the Roman arms, no part of which reflected on the Em peror, for [being jealous of his fame] he used this eminent commander with the basest ingra titude. After fifteen tedious years, this monster fell at last the victim of assassination, the Em press herself [who had accidentally found her own name in his tablets as one of the persons doomed to die] conducting the plot for his murder, A. D. 96. 8. Cocceius Nerva, a Cretan by birth, was chosen Emperor by the senate, from respect to the virtues of his character ; but too old for the burden of government, and of a temper too placid for the restraint of rooted corruptions and enor mities, his reign was weak, inefficient, and con temptible. His only act of real merit, as a sovereign, was the adoption of the virtuous"], [282, "254 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. Trajan as his successor. Nerva died, after a reign of sixteen months, A. D. 98. 9. Ulpius Trajanus possessed every talent and every virtue that can adorn a sovereign. Of great military abilities, and an indefatigable spirit of enterprise, he raised the Roman arms to their ancient splendour, and greatly enlarged the boundaries of the empire. He subdued the Dacians, conquered the Parthians, and brought under subjection Assyria, Mesopotamia, and Arabia Felix. Nor was he less eminent in pro moting the happiness of his subjects, and the internal prosperity of the empire. His lar gesses were humane and munificent. He was the friend and support of the virtuous indigent, and the liberal patron of every useful art and talent. His bounties were supplied by a well judged economy in his private fortune, and a wise administration of the public finances. In his own life he was a man of simple manners, modest, affable, fond of the familiar intercourse of his friends, and sensible to all the social and benevolent affections [not disdaining, sometimes, in private company to exceed the bounds of strict temperance, but subject to this singular precaution, a positive injunction previously given to his ministers, never to carry into execution"], [283, "SECT. 42. 255 ANCIENT HISTORY. any orders he might at such times chance to issue]. In a wrord, [he so lived and ruled, as very justly to] merit the surname universally bestowed on him, Trajanus Optimus. [He had studied philosophy under the celebrated Plu tarch, which probably rendered him not insen sible to the mild remonstrances of Pliny, who ventured to interpose in favour of the Christians, whom, contrary to his general disposition, he was inclined to view with too jealous an eye, the only blot perhaps in his character ; the most estimable qualities being in him so balanced, as to leave little room for excess in any.] He died at the age of sixty-three, after a glorious reign of nineteen years, A. D. 117. 10. \u00c6lius Adrianus, [by descent a Spaniard,] nephew of Trajan, and worthy to fill his place, was chosen Emperor by the army in the East, and his title was acknowledged by all orders of the state. He adopted a policy different from that of his predecessor ; and, judging the limits of the empire too extensive, abandoned all the conquests of Trajan, bounding the eastern pro vinces by the Euphrates. He visited in person the whole provinces of the empire, reforming, in his progress, all abuses, relieving his subjects of every oppressive burden, rebuilding the ruined"], [284, "256 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. cities, and establishing every where a regular and mild administration under magistrates of approved probity and humanity. [Though compelled to punish a revolt of the Jews se- verely, he remitted the sentence of persecution issued against the Christians, on the interposition of Granianus the proconsul of Asia.] He gave a discharge to the indigent debtors of the state, and appointed liberal institutions for the educa- tion of the children of the poor. [His public works were numerous, and though in some in- stances complimentary to himself, as is shown in the names of \u00c6lia and Adrian ople bestowed on the cities he rebuilt, he was not unmindful of the fame of others : he adorned the tomb of Epaminondas at Mantinea ; rebuilt and beauti- fied the one placed over the remains of Pompey in Egypt ; and completed the temple of Jupiter Olympus, begun by Antiochus Epiphanes ; he built also a library at Athens.] To the talents of an able politician, he joined an excellent taste in the liberal arts. [He could compose both in verse and prose ; excelled as an orator ; was deeply versed in the mathematics, and skilful in physic ; in drawing, painting, and music, he dis played no inconsiderable abilities, but his talents for business exceeded all his other attainments.]"], [285, "SECT. 43. ANCIENT HISTORY. 257 His reign, [in short, which lasted nearly] twenty two years, was an \u00e6ra of public happiness and splendour [of peace and prosperity]. In the last year of his life, [which disease rendered sadly distressing to him,] he bequeathed to the empire a double legacy, in adopting and declar ing for his immediate successor Titus Aurelius Antoninus, and substituting Annius Verus to succeed upon his death. These were the An tonines, who for forty years ruled the Roman empire with consummate wisdom, ability, and virtue. Adrian died, A. D. 138, at the age of sixty-two. XLIIL AGE OF THE ANTONINES, &C. 1. The happiest reigns furnish the fewest events for the pen of history. Antoninus was the father of his people. He preferred peace to the ambition of conquest ; yet in every neces sary war the Roman arms had their wonted renown. The British province was enlarged by the conquests of Urbicus, and some formidable rebellions were subdued in Germany, Dacia, and vol. i. s"], [286, "258 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. the East. The domestic administration of the sovereign was dignified, splendid, and humane. With all the virtues of Numa, his love of re igion, peace, and justice, he had the superior advantage of diffusing these blessings over a great portion of the world. [For his friendship, alliance, and advice were solicited and courted by the most distant nations ; over some of which he was even requested to appoint a king, whom they were afterwards careful and even proud to obey. He succoured and relieved the oppressed Christians, forbidding any to molest them on the score of religion : he favoured and rewarded learned persons, and established funds for the advancement of education.] He died at the age of seventy-four, aster a reign of twenty-two years, A.D. 161. 2. Annius Verus assumed, at his accession, the name of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus ; and he bestowed on his brother Lucius Verus a joint administration of the empire. The former was as eminent for the worth and virtues of his cha racter as the latter was remarkable for pro fligacy, meanness, and vice. Marcus Aurelius was attached both by nature and education to the Stoical philosophy, which he has admirably taught and illustrated in his Meditations ; and 18"], [287, "SECT. 43. ANCIENT HISTORY. 259 his own life was the best commentary on his precepts. The Parthians were repulsed in an attack upon the empire, and a rebellion of the Germans was subdued. In these wars the mean and worthless Verus brought disgrace upon the Roman name in every region where he com manded ; but fortunately relieved the empire of its fears by an early death. The residue of the reign of Marcus Aurelius was a continued bless ing to his subjects. He reformed the internal policy of the state, regulated the government of the provinces, and visited himself, for the pur poses of beneficence, the most distant quarters of his dominions. V He appeared,\" says an ancient author, \" like some benevolent deity, \" diffusing around him universal peace and hap m piness.\" He died in Pannonia in the 59th year of his age, and 19th of his reign, A.D. 180, [and with him seem to have expired the glory and prosperity of the Roman empire.] 3. Commodus, his most unworthy son, suc ceeded to the empire on his death. He re sembled in character his mother Faustina, a woman infamous for all manner of vice, but who yet had passed with her husband Marcus for a paragon of virtue. [The extreme contrast be tween the characters of Aurelius and Commodus, s 2"], [288, "260 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. and the resemblance of the latter to his mother, naturally led people to question his legitimacy : it is doubtful whether he himself did not harbour the same suspicions.] Commodus had an aver sion to every rational and liberal pursuit, and a fond attachment to the sports of the circus and amphitheatre, the hunting of wild beasts, and the combats of boxers and gladiators. The measures of this reign were as unimportant as the character of the sovereign was contemptible. His concubine and some of his chief officers prevented their own destruction by assassinating the tyrant, in the 32d year of his age, and 13th of his reign, A.D. 193. 4. The pr\u00e6torian guards gave the empire to Publius Helvius Pertinax, a man of mean birth, but who had risen to esteem by his virtues and military talents. He applied himself with zeal to the correction of abuses ; but the austerity of his government deprived him of the affections of a corrupted people. He had disappointed the army of a promised reward ; and after a reign of eighty-six days was murdered in the imperial palace by the same hands which had placed him on the throne. 5. The empire was now put up to auction by the pr\u00e6torians, and was purchased by Didius"], [289, "SECT. 43. 261 ANCIENT HISTORY. Julianus ; [a man of great wealth, and eminent as a lawyer;] while Pescenius Niger in Asia, Clodius Albinus in Britain, and Septimius Severus in Illyria, were each chosen Emperor by the troops they commanded. Severus [an African by birth] marched to Rome ; and the pr\u00e6to rians, on his approach, abandoned Didius, who had failed to pay the stipulated price for his elevation, and the senate formally deposed and put him to death. Severus, master of Rome, [after very properly degrading the pr\u00e6torian soldiers who had so basely put the empire up to sale,] prepared to reduce the provinces which had acknowledged the sovereignty of Niger and Albinus ; and these two rivals being successively subdued, the one lost his life in battle, and the other fell by his own hands. The administration of Severus was wise and equitable, but tinctured with despotic rigour. It was his purpose to erect the fabric of absolute monarchy, and all his institutions operated with able policy to that end. He possessed eminent military talents ; and it was a glorious boast of his, that having received the empire oppressed with foreign and domestic wars, he left it in profound, universal, and honourable peace. He carried with him into Britain his two sons, Caracalla and Geta, s 3"], [290, "262 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. whose unpromising dispositions clouded his latter days. In this war the Caledonians under Fingal are said to have defeated, on the banks of the Carron, Caracul, the son of the king of the world. [Though finally compelled to sue for peace, they certainly contributed largely to the reduction of the Roman army, which also suffered consider ably from the rigours of a northern climate.] Severus died at York, in the 66th year of his age, after a reign of eighteen years, A.D. 211. 6. The mutual hatred of Caracalla and Geta [who happened to be of very different disposi tions] was increased by their association in the empire ; and the former, with brutal inhumanity, caused his [more mild and placid] brother to be openly murdered in the arms of his mother. His reign, which was of six years' duration, and one continued series of atrocities, was at length terminated by assassination, A. D. 217. [He was not indeed neglectful of the embellish ment of the city of Rome ; his baths, in parti cular, were of singular magnificence.] 7- Those disorders in the empire which began with Commodus continued for about a century, till the accession of Diocletian. That interval was filled by the reigns of Macrinus, Helioga balus, [a monster of wickedness and folly,]"], [291, "SECT. 43. 263 ANCIENT HISTORY. Alexander Severus, Maximin, Gordian, Philip Decius, Gallus, Valerianus, Gallienus, Claudius, Aurelianus, Tacitus, Probus, and Carus ; a period of which the annals furnish neither amusement nor useful information. [Though they afford a striking proof of the very low estate to which the empire was reduced under the tyranny of the soldiery, six princes being cut off by the sword in the short space of three years. In the reign of Gallienus no less than thirty different persons, in the several pro- vinces, assumed the rights of sovereignty at the head of their respective armies ; not one, how- ever, was allowed to enjoy a moment's peace, or to die a natural death.] The single exception [to the tumultuous and perplexed proceedings of the above period] is the reign of Alexander Severus ; a mild, beneficent, and enlightened prince, whose character shines the more from the contrast of those who preceded and followed him. [Of Decius, indeed, whose reign was too short to admit of his doing any thing very con- siderable, it may be observed that he displayed virtues which reminded his subjects of the times of Trajan, whose name he bore.

D. 284, and introduced a new system of administration, dividing the empire into four governments, under as many princes. Maximian shared with him the title of Augustus ; and Galerius and Constantius were declared C\u00e6sars. Each had his separate department or province, all no minally supreme, but in reality under the direc tion of the superior talents and authority of Diocletian ; an unwise policy, which depended for its efficacy on individual ability alone. [Neither of these princes chose to reside at Rome ; Diocletian making Nicomedia in Bi thynia the seat of his empire, and Maximian Milan. This had, as might have been expected, a great effect on the power of the senate, and other ancient institutions. The civil offices of consul, proconsul, censor, and tribune, were suppressed, and the foundation laid, for what soon after took place, the establishment of another capital, and the division of the empire.] Diocletian and Maximian, trusting to the con tinuance of that order in the empire which their vigour had established, formally retired from sovereignty, and left the government in the"], [293, "SECT. 43. 265 ANCIENT HISTORY. hands of the C\u00e6sars ; but Constantius died soon after in Britain, and his son Constantine was proclaimed Emperor at York, though Galerius did not acknowledge his title [and set up Se verus in opposition to him ; allowing Constan tine, indeed, to be C\u00e6sar, but giving the title of Augustus to Severus]. Maximian, however, having once more resumed the purple, bestowed on Constantine his daughter in marriage, and thus invested him with a double title to empire. On the death of Maximian and Galerius, Con stantine had no other immediate competitor than Maxentius, the reputed son of the former [for Licinius, who had been declared C\u00e6sar by Galerius in the room of Severus, together with his colleague Maximin, were in the eastern provinces]. The contest between [Constantine and Maxentius] was soon decided by the sword. Maxentius fell in battle, and Constantine [after the death of both his eastern competitors, Max- imin in 313, and Licinius, who after marrying his sister, and acting with him as joint emperor, died in opposition to him,] remained sole master of the empire. 9. The administration of Constantine was, in the beginning of his reign, mild, equitable, and politic. Though zealously attached to the Chris-"], [294, "266 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. tian faith, he made no violent innovations on the religion of the state. He introduced order and economy into the civil government, and repressed every species of oppression and cor- ruption. But his natural temper was severe and cruel ; and the latter part of his reign was as much deformed by intolerant zeal and san- guinary rigour, as the former had been remark- able for equity and benignity. From this un- favourable change of character, he lost the affections of his subjects ; and, from a feeling probably of reciprocal disgust, he removed the seat of the Roman empire to Byzantium, now termed Constantinople [originally a Grecian colony, well situated for trade, and admirably calculated to become the seat of empire]. The court followed the sovereign ; the opulent pro prietors were attended by their slaves and re tainers ; [the common people received gifts of money and corn ;] Rome was in a few years greatly depopulated, and the new capital swelled at once to enormous magnitude. It was cha racterised by eastern splendour, luxury, and voluptuousness ; and the cities of Greece were despoiled for its embellishment. [But the most remarkable of the new erected edifices were the churches, to the number of fourteen, appropriated"], [295, "SECT. 44. 267 ANCIENT HISTORY. to the worship of the true God, and the rites of Christianity.] Of the internal policy of the empire we shall treat in the next section. In an expedition against the Persians, [seven years after the dedication of the new city,] Constan tine died at Nicomedia, in the 30th year of his reign, and 63d of his age, A. D. 337- In the time of Constantine the Goths had made several irruptions on the empire, and, though repulsed and beaten, began gradually to encroach on the provinces. XLIV. STATE OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE AT THE TIME OF CONSTANTINE. HIS SUCCESSORS. 1. In lieu of the ancient republican distinc tions, which were founded chiefly on personal merit, a rigid subordination of rank and office now went through all the orders of the state. The magistrates were divided into three classes, distinguished by the unmeaning titles of, 1. The Illustrious; 2. The Respectable; 8. The ClaA rissimi. The epithet of Illustrious was bestowed on, 1. The consuls and patricians ; 2. The pr\u00e6-"], [296, "268 PART 1 ANCIENT HISTORY. torian pr\u00e6fects of Rome and Constantinople ; 3. The masters-general of the cavalry and in- fantry; 4. The seven ministers of the palace. The consuls were created by the sole authority of the Emperor : their dignity was inefficient ; they had no appropriate function in the state, and their names served only to give the legal date to the year. The dignity of patrician was not, as in ancient times, a hereditary distinction, but was bestowed, as a title of honour, by the Emperor on his favourites. From the time of the abolition of the pr\u00e6torian bands by Con- stantine, the dignity of pr\u00e6torian pr\u00e6fect was conferred on the civil governors of the four de- partments of the empire. These were, the East, Illyria, Italy, and the Gauls. They had the supreme administration of justice and of the finances, the power of supplying all the inferior magistracies in their district, and an appellative jurisdiction from all its tribunals. Independent of their authority, Rome and Constantinople had each its own pr\u00e6fect, who was the chief magistrate of the city. In the second class, the Respectable, were the proconsuls of Asia, Achaia, and Africa, and the military comites and duces, generals of the imperial armies. The third class, Clarissimi, comprehended the inferior"], [297, "SECT. 44. 269 ANCIENT HISTORY. governors and magistrates of the provinces, re sponsible to the pr\u00e6fects and their deputies. 2. The intercourse between the court and provinces was maintained by the construction of roads, and the institution of regular posts or couriers ; under which denomination were rankedthe numberless spies of government, whose duty was to convey all sorts of intelligence from the remotest quarters of the empire to its chief seat. Every institution was calculated to sup port the fabric of despotism. Torture was em ployed for the discovery of crimes. Taxes and impositions of every nature were prescribed and levied by the sole authority of the Emperor. The quantity and rate was fixed by a census made over all the provinces, and part was gene rally paid in money, part in the produce of the lands ; a burden frequently found so grievous as to prompt to the neglect of agriculture. Every object of merchandise and manufacture was likewise highly taxed. Subsidies, moreover, were exacted from all the cities, under the name of free gifts, on various occasions of public con cern ; as the accession of an emperor, his consu late, the birth of a prince, a victory over the Barbarians, or any other event of similar import ance."], [298, "270 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. 3. An impolitic distinction was made between the troops stationed in the distant provinces and those in the heart of the empire. The latter, termed Palatines, enjoyed a higher pay, and more peculiar favour, and, having less employ- ment, spent their time in idleness and luxury ; while the former, termed the Borderers, who, in fact, had the care of the empire, and were exposed to perpetual hard service, had, with an inferior reward, the mortification of feeling themselves regarded as of meaner rank than their fellow-soldiers. Constantine, likewise, from a timid policy of guarding against mutinies of the troops, reduced the legion from its ancient complement of 5000, 6000, 7000, and 8000, to 1000 or 1500, and debased the body of the army by the intermixture of Scythians, Goths, and Germans. 4. This immense mass of heterogeneous parts, which internally laboured with the seeds of dis solution and corruption, was kept together for some time by the vigorous exertion of despotic authority. The fabric was splendid and august ; but it wanted both that energy of constitution and that real dignity which, in former times, it derived from the exercise of heroic and patriotic virtues."], [299, "SECT. 44. ANCIENT HISTORY. 271 5. Constantine, with a destructive policy, had divided the empire among five princes, three of them his sons, and two nephews ; but Constan tius, the youngest of the sons, finally got rid of all his competitors, and ruled the empire alone with a weak and impotent sceptre. A variety of domestic broils, and mutinies of the troops against their generals, had left the western fron tier to the mercy of the barbarian nations. The Franks, Saxons, Alemanni, and Sarmatians, laid waste all the fine countries watered by the Rhine ; and the Persians made dreadful incursions on the provinces of the East. Constantius indolently wasted his time in theological controversies, but was prevailed on to adopt one prudent measure, the appointment of his cousin Julian to the dignity of C\u00e6sar. 6. Julian possessed many heroic qualities, and his mind was formed by nature for the sovereignty of a great people ; though educated [as a Christian, and outwardly conforming for some time to its principles and discipline, he had unfortunately imbibed] at Athens, in the schools of the Platonic philosophy, [during his exile from the court,] a rooted antipathy to the doctrines of the Gospel. With every talent of a general, and possessing the confidence and affec-"], [300, "272 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. tion of his troops, he once more restored the glory of the Roman arms, and successfully re pressed the invasions of the Barbarians. His victories excited the jealousy of Constantius, who meanly resolved to remove from his com mand the better part of his troops. The conse quence was a declaration of the army, that it was their choice that Julian should be their Emperor. Constantius escaped the ignominy that awaited him by dying at this critical junc ture, [in Cilicia,] and Julian was immediately acknowledged sovereign of the Roman empire. 7. The reformation of civil abuses formed the first object of his attention ; which he next turned to the reformation, as he thought, of re ligion, by the suppression of Christianity. He began by reforming the Pagan theology, and sought to raise the character of its priests, by inculcating purity of life and sanctity of mo rals ; thus bearing involuntary testimony to the superior excellence, in those respects, of that religion which he laboured to abolish. [Though it must be acknowledged it did not receive the countenance it might have done from the cor respondent manners of its own priesthood. After the church became triumphant, the passions of the latter hurried them into excesses very con-"], [301, "SECT. 44. 273 ANCIENT HISTORY. trary to the pure spirit of the religion they taught.] Without persecuting, Julian attacked the Chris tians by the more dangerous policy of treating them with contempt, and removing them, as visionaries, from all employments of public trust. He refused them the benefit of the laws to decide their differences, because their religion forbade all dissensions ; and they were debarred the studies of literature and philosophy, which they could not learn but from Pagan authors. He was himself, as a Pagan, the slave of the most bigotted superstition, believing in omens and auguries, and fancying himself favoured with an actual intercourse with the gods and goddesses. To avenge the injuries which the empire had sustained from the Persians, Julian marched into the heart of Asia, and was for some time in the train of conquest, when, in a fatal engagement, though crowned with victory, he was slain at the age of thirty-one, after a reign of three years, A.D. 363. 8. The Roman army was dispirited by the death of its commander. They chose for their Emperor, Jovian, [a Pannonian by birth,] a captain of the domestic guards, and purchased a free retreat from the dominions of Persia by the ignominious surrender of five provinces, which vol. 1. T"], [302, "274 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. had been ceded by a former sovereign to Galerius [including Nisibis, the most important garrison on the eastern frontier]. The short reign of Jovian, a period of only seven months, [for he died before he reached Constantinople,] was mild and equitable. He favoured Christianity, and restored its votaries to all their privileges as subjects. He died suddenly at the age of thirty three. 9. Valentinian was chosen Emperor by the army on the death of Jovian ; a man of obscure birth and severe manners, but of considerable military talents. He associated with himself in the empire his brother Valens, to whom he gave the dominion of the eastern provinces, reserving to himself the western. The Persians, under Sapor, were making inroads on the former, and the latter was subject to continual invasion from the northern barbarians. They were successfully repelled by Valentinian in many battles ; and his domestic administration was wise, equitable, and politic. The Christian religion was favoured by the Emperor, though not promoted by the per secution of its adversaries ; a contrast to the conduct of his brother Valens, who, intemper ately supporting the Arian heresy, set the whole provinces in a flame, and drew a swarm of in- 7*"], [303, "SECT. 44. ANCIENT HISTORY. 275 vaders upon the empire in the guise of friends and allies, who in the end entirely subverted it. These were the Goths, who, migrating from Scandinavia, had, in the second century, settled on the banks of the Palus M\u00e6otis, and thence gradually extended their territory. In the reign of Valens they took possession of Dacia, and were known by the distinct appellation of Ostro goths and Visigoths, or Eastern and Western Goths ; a remarkable people, and whose man ners, customs, government, and laws, are after wards to be particularly noted. 10. Valentinian died on an expedition against the Alemanni, and was succeeded in the empire of the West by Gratian, his eldest son, a boy of sixteen years of age, A. D. 367. Valens, in the East, was the scourge of his people. The Huns, a new race of barbarians, of Tartar or Siberian origin, now poured down on the provinces both of the West and East. The Goths, compara tively a civilised people, fled before them. The Visigoths, who were first attacked, requested protection from the empire, and Valens impru dently gave them a settlement in Thrace. The Ostrogoths made the same request, and, on refusal, forced their way into the same province. T 2"], [304, "276 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. Valens gave them battle at Adrianople : hi army was defeated, and he himself slain in the engagement. The Goths, unresisted, ravaged Achaia and Pannonia. 11.

The character of Theodosius, deservedly sur named the Great, was worthy of the best ages of the Roman state. He successfully repelled the encroachments of the Barbarians, and se cured, by wholesome laws, the prosperity of his people.

PROGRESS OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION FROM ITS INSTITUTION TO THE EXTINCTION OF PAGANISM IN THE REIGN OF THEODOSIUS. 1. The reign of Theodosius was signalised by the downfall of the Pagan superstition, and the full establishment of the Christian religion in the Roman empire. This great revolution of opinions is highly worthy of attention, and naturally induces a retrospect to the condition of the Christian church from its institution down to this period. It has been frequently remarked, because it is an obvious truth, that the concurrence of cir cumstances at the time of our Saviour's birth was such as, while a Divine revelation seemed to be then more peculiarly needed, the state of the world was remarkably favourable for the extensive dissemination of the doctrines it con veyed. The union of so many nations under one power, and the1 extension of civilisation, were favourable to the progress of a religion T O"], [306, "278 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. which prescribed universal charity and benevo lence. The gross superstitions of Paganism, and its tendency to corrupt instead of purifying the morals, contributed to explode its influence with every thinking mind. Even the prevalent philosophy of the times, Epicurism, more easily understood than the refinements of the Platonists, and more grateful than the severities of the Stoics, tended to degrade human nature to the level of the brute creation. The Christian reli gion, thus necessary for the reformation of the world, found its chief partisans in those who were the friends of virtue, and its enemies among the votaries of vice. 2. The persecution which the Christians un derwent from the Romans has been deemed an exception to that spirit of toleration they showed to the religions of other nations : but they were tolerating only to those whose theologies were not hostile to their own. The religion of the Romans was interwoven with their political constitution. The zeal of the Christians, aim ing at the suppression of all idolatry, was not unnaturally regarded as dangerous to the state ; and hence they were the object of hatred and persecution. In the first century, the Christian church suffered deeply under Nero and Domi-"], [307, "SECT. 45. ANCIENT HISTORY. 279 tian ; yet those persecutions had no tendency to check the progress of its doctrines. 3. It is a matter of question what was the form of the primitive church, and the nature of its government ; and on this head much differ ence of opinion obtains, not only between the Catholics and Protestants, but between the dif ferent classes of the latter, as the Lutherans and Calvinists. It is moreover an opinion, that our Saviour and his Apostles, confining their pre cepts to the pure doctrines of religion, have left all Christian societies to regulate their frame and government in the manner best suited to the civil constitutions of the countries in which they are established. 4. In the second century, the books of the New Testament were collected into a volume by the elder fathers of the church, and received as a canon of faith. The Old Testament had been translated from the Hebrew into Greek, by order of Ptolemy Philadelphus, 284 years before Christ. The early church suffered much from an absurd endeavour of the more learned of its votaries to reconcile its doctrines to the tenets of the Pagan philosophers ; hence the sects of the Gnostics and Ammonians, and the Platonising Christians. The Greek churches T 4"], [308, "280 ANCIENT HISTORY'. PART I. began in the 2d century to form provincial as sociations, and establish general rules of govern ment and disipline. Assemblies were held, termed Synodi and Concilia, over which a me tropolitan presided. A short time after arose the superior order of Patriarch, presiding over a large district of the Christian world ; and a subordination taking place even among these, the Bishop of Rome was acknowledged the chief of the Patriarchs. Persecution still attended the early church, even under those excellent princes, Trajan, Adrian, and the Antonines; and in the reign of Severus, the whole provinces of the empire were stained with the blood of the martyrs. [It was impossible for Christianity to enter into competition with the tenets and rites of Paganism, without offending many pre judices, interfering with many interests, exciting many alarms, and giving a handle to all persons in power or otherwise, who wished to be free from moral restraint, to proscribe it, as a religion incompatible with the course and stability of worldly affairs.] 5. The 3d century was more favourable to the progress of Christianity and the tranquillity of its disciples. In those times it suffered less from the civil arm than from the pens of the 9*"], [309, "SECT. 45. ANCIENT HISTORY. 281 Pagan philosophers, Porphyry, Philostratus, &c. ; but these attacks called forth the zeal and ta lents of many able defenders, as Origen, Diony sius, and Cyprian. A part of the Gauls, Ger many, and Britain, received in this century the light of the Gospel. 6. In the 4th century, the Christian church was alternately persecuted and cherished by the Roman Emperors. Among its oppressors we rank Diocletian, Galerius, and Julian. Among its favourers, Constantine and his sons, Valen tinian, Valens, Gratian, and the excellent Theo dosius, in whose reign the Pagan superstition came to its final period. 7- From the age of Numa to the reign of Gratian, the Romans preserved the regular suc cession of the several sacerdotal colleges, the Pontiffs, Augurs, Vestals, Flamines, Salii, &c, whose authority, though weakened in the latter ages, was still protected by the laws. Even the Christian Emperors held, like their Pagan pre decessors, the office of Pontifex Maximus. Gra tian was the first who refused that ancient dig nity as a profanation. In the time of Theodo sius, the cause of Christianity and of Paganism was solemnly debated in the Roman senate between Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan, the"], [310, "282 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. champion of the former, and Symmachus, the defender of the latter. The cause of Christi anity was triumphant ; and the senate issued its decree for the abolition of Paganism, whose downfall in the capital was soon followed by its extinction in the provinces. Theodosius, with able policy, permitted no persecution of the an cient religion, which perished with the more rapidity that its fall was gentle and unresisted. 8. But the Christian church exhibited a su perstition in some respects little less irrational than Polytheism, in the worship of saints and relics ; and many novel tenets, unfounded in the precepts of our Saviour and his apostles, were manifestly borrowed from the Pagan schools. The doctrines of the Platonic philosophy seem to have led to the notions of an intermediate state of purification, celibacy of the priests, as cetic mortifications, penances, and monastic se clusion."], [311, "SECT. 46. ANCIENT HISTORY. 283 XLVI. EXTINCTION OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE IN THE WEST. 1. In the reigns of Arcadius and Honorius, the sons and successors of Theodosius, the bar barian nations established themselves in the frontier provinces both of the East and West. Theodosius had committed the government to Rufinus and Stilicho, during the nonage of his sons ; [the former as guardian of Arcadius in the East, the latter of Honorius in the West ;] their fatal dissensions gave every advantage to the enemies of the empire. The Huns, actually invited by Rufinus, [who sought to ascend the Byzantine throne himself,] overspread Armenia, Cappadocia, and Syria. The Goths, under Alaric, ravaged to the borders of Italy, and laid waste Achaia to the Peloponnesus. Stilicho, an able General, [a Vandal by birth,] made a noble stand against these invaders ; but his plans were frustrated by the machinations of his rivals, and the weakness of Arcadius, who purchased an ignominious peace, by ceding to Alaric the whole of Greece."], [312, "284 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. 2. Alaric, now styled King of the Visigoths, prepared to add Italy to his new dominions. He passed the Alps, and was carrying all before him, when, amused by the politic Stilicho with the prospect of a new cession of territory, he was taken at unawares, and defeated by that General, then commanding the armies of Hono rius. The Emperor triumphantly celebrated, on that occasion, the eternal defeat of the Gothic nation ; an eternity bounded by the lapse of a few months. In this interval, a torrent of the Goths breaking down upon Germany, forced the nations whom they dispossessed, the Suevi, Alani, and Vandals, to precipitate themselves upon Italy. They joined their arms to those of Alaric, who, thus reinforced, determined to overwhelm Rome. The policy of Stilicho made him change his purpose, on the promise of 4000 pounds weight of gold; a promise repeatedly broken by Honorius, and its violation finally re venged by Alaric, by the sack and plunder of the city, A.D. 410. With generous magnani mity, he was sparing of the lives of the van quished, and with singular liberality of spirit, anxious to preserve every ancient edifice from destruction. [The enemies of Stilicho accused him of conniving at the attacks of Alaric, if not"], [313, "SECT. 46. ANCIENT HISTORY. 285 even of having invited him into Italy, and by so representing matters to Honorius, caused him to be arrested and decapitated. It seems still doubtful whether there were not grounds for the imputation ; but an able minister, ill supported by a weak master, might easily act so, with the best intentions, as to lay himself open to misre presentations. Zosimus denies the truth of the charges brought against him, and Claudian has immortalised his memory.] 3. Alaric, preparing now for the conquest of Sicily and Africa, died at this \u00e6ra of his highest glory ; and Honorius, instead of pro fiting by this event to recover his lost provinces, made a treaty with his successor Ataulfus, gave him in marriage his sister Placidia, and secured his friendship by ceding to him a portion of Spain, while a great part of what remained had before been occupied by the Vandals. He allowed soon after to the Burgundians a just title to their conquests in Gaul. Thus the Western empire was by degrees mouldering from under the dominion of its ancient masters. 4. In the East, the mean and dissolute Arca dius died in the year 408, leaving that empire to his infant son Theodosius II., whose sister Pulcheria swayed the sceptre with much pru-"], [314, "286 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. dence and ability ; and the weakness of her brother allowed her government to be of forty years' continuance. Honorius died in the year 423. The laws of Arcadius and Honorius are, with a few exceptions, remarkable for their wisdom and equity ; a singular ph\u00e6nomenon, considering the personal character of those princes, and evincing at least that they employed some able ministers. 5. The Vandals, under Genseric, subdued the Roman province in Africa. The Huns, in the East, extended their conquests from the borders of China to the Baltic Sea. Under Attila they laid waste M\u0153sia and Thrace ; and Theodo sius II., after a mean attempt to murder the Barbarian General, ingloriously submitted to pay him an annual tribute. It was in this crisis of universal decay, that the Britons implored the Romans to defend them against the Picts and Scots, but received for answer, that they had nothing to bestow on them but compassion. The Britons, in despair, sought aid from the Saxons and Angles, who seized, as their property, the country they were invited to protect, and founded, in the 5th and 6th centuries, the king doms of the Saxon Heptarchy. (See Part II. Sect. XII. \u00a7 5.)"], [315, "SECT. 46. ANCIENT HISTORY. 287 6. Attila, with an army of 500,000 men, threatened the total destruction of the empire. He was ably opposed by \u00c6tius, General of Valentinian III., now Emperor of the West, who was himself shut up in Rome by the arms of the Barbarian, and at length compelled to pur chase a peace. On the death of Attila, his dominions were dismembered by his sons, whose dissensions gave temporary relief to the falling empire. 7- After Valentinian III. we have in the West a succession of princes, or rather names ; for the events of their reigns merit no detail. In the reign of Romulus, surnamed Augustulus, the son of Orestes, the empire of the West came to a final period. Odoacer, Prince of the Heruli, subdued Italy, and spared the life of Augustulus, on the condition of his resigning the throne, A. D. 476. From the building of Rome to this \u00e6ra, the extinction of the Western Empire, is a period of 1224 years. 8. We may reduce to one ultimate cause the various circumstances that produced the decline and fall of this once magnificent fabric. The ruin of the Roman empire was the inevitable conse quence of its greatness. The extension of its dominion relaxed the vigour of its frame ; the"], [316, "288 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. vices of the conquered nations infected the vic torious legions, and foreign luxuries corrupted their commanders; selfish interest supplanted the patriotic affection ; the martial spirit was pur posely debased by the Emperors, who dreaded its effects on their own power ; and the whole mass, thus weakened and enervated, fell an easy prey to the torrent of Barbarians which over whelmed it. 9. The Herulian dominion in Italy was of short duration. Theodoric, Prince of the Os trogoths, (afterwards deservedly surnamed the (jireat,) obtained permission of Zeno, Emperor of the East, [who was anxious to remove the Ostrogoths from his own dominions,] to attempt the recovery of Italy, and a promise of its so vereignty as the reward of his success. The whole nation of the Ostrogoths attended the standard of their prince ; and Theodoric, victo rious in repeated engagements, at length com pelled Odoacer to surrender all Italy to the con queror. The Romans had tasted of happiness under the government of Odoacer, and it was increased under the dominion of Theodoric, who possessed every talent and virtue of a so vereign. His equity and clemency rendered him a blessing to his subjects : he allied himself"], [317, "SECT. 46. 289 ANCIENT HISTORY. with all the surrounding nations, the Franks, [having married the sister of their King, Clovis,] Visigoths, Burgundians, and Vandals ; and he left a peaceable sceptre to his grandson Atha laric, during whose infancy his mother Amala sonte governed with such admirable wisdom and moderation, as left her subjects no real cause of regret for the loss of her father. 10. While such was the state of Gothic Italy, the empire of the East was under the govern ment of Justinian, a prince of mean ability, vain, capricious, and tyrannical. Yet the Roman name rose for a whde from its abasement by the merit of his Generals. Belisarius was the sup port of his , throne, yet to him he behaved with the most shocking ingratitude. The Persians were at this time the most formidable enemies of the empire, under their sovereigns Cabades and Cosrhoes ; and from the latter, a most able prince, Justinian meanly purchased a peace, by a cession of territory, and an enormous tribute in gold. The civil factions of Constantinople, arising from the most contemptible of causes, the disputes of the performers in the circus and amphitheatre, threatened to hurl Justinian from the throne, had they not been fortunately com posed by the arms and the policy of Belisarius. vol. i. u"], [318, "290 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. This great General overwhelmed the Vandal sovereignty of Africa, and recovered that pro vince to the empire. He wrested Italy from its Gothic sovereign, and once more restored it, for a short space, to the dominion of its ancient masters. 11. Italy was once more subdued by the Goths, under the heroic Totila, who besieged and took the city of Rome, but forbore to de stroy it at the request of Belisarius. The for tunes of this great man were now in the wane. He was compelled to evacuate Italy; and, on his return to Constantinople, his long services were repaid with disgrace. He was superseded in the command of the armies by the eunuch Narses, who defeated Totila in a decisive en gagement, in which the Gothic prince was slain. Narses governed Italy with great ability for thir teen years, when he was ungratefully recalled by Justin II., the successor of Justinian. He invited the Lombards [under Alboin, who had fought with him against Totila,] to avenge his injuries ; and this new tribe of invaders over-ran and conquered the country, A. D. 568."], [319, "SECT. 47. ANCIENT HISTORY. 291 XLVII. OF THE ORIGIN, MANNERS, AND CHARACTER, OF THE GOTHIC NATIONS, BEFORE THEIR ESTAB- LISHMENT IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 1. The history and manners of the Gothic nations are curious objects of enquiry, from their influence on the constitutions and national character of most of the modern kingdoms of Europe. As the present inhabitants of these kingdoms are a mixed race, compounded of the Goths and of the nations whom they subdued, the laws, manners, and institutions of the modern kingdoms are the result of this conjunction; and in so far as these are different from the usages prevalent before this intermixture, they are, in all probability, to be traced from the ancient manners and institutions of those northern tribes. We purpose to consider, 1. The original cha racter of the Gothic nations ; and, 2. The change of their manners on their establishment in the Roman empire. 2. The Scandinavian chronicles attribute to the ancient inhabitants of that country an u 2"], [320, "292 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. Asiatic origin, and inform us that the Goths were a colony of Scythians, who migrated thither from the banks of the Black Sea and the Caspian ; but these chronicles do not fix the period of this migration, which some later writers suppose to have been 1000 years, and others only 70, before the Christian \u00e6ra. Odin, the chief deity of the Scandinavians, was the god of the Scythians. Sigga, a Scythian prince, is said to have under taken a distant expedition ; and, after subduing several of the Sarmatian tribes, to have pene trated into the northern parts of Germany, and thence into Scandinavia. He assumed the honours of divinity, and the title of Odin his national god. He conquered Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, and gave wise and salutary laws to the nations he had subdued by his arms. 3. The agreement in manners between the Scythians and the ancient Scandinavian nations is strongly corroborative of the accounts given in the northern chronicles of the identity of their origin. The description of the manners of the Germans by Tacitus (though this people was probably not of Scythian but of Celtic origin) may, in many particulars, be applied to the an cient nations of Scandinavia ; and the same description coincides remarkably with the ac-"], [321, "SECT. 47. ANCIENT HISTORY. 293 count given by Herodotus of the manners of the Scythians. Their life was spent in hunting, pasturage, and predatory war. Their dress, their weapons, their food, their respect for their women, their religious worship, were the same. They despised learning, and had no other re cords for many ages than the songs of their bards. 4. The theology of the Scandinavians was most intimately connected with their manners. They held three great principles or funda mental doctrines of religion : \" To serve the \" Supreme Being with prayer and sacrifice; to \" do no wrong or unjust action ; and to be in \" trepid in fight.\" These principles are the key to the Edda, or sacred book, of the Scan dinavians, which, though it contains the sub stance of a very ancient religion, is not itself a work of high antiquity, being compiled in the thirteenth century by Snorro Sturleson, supreme judge of Iceland. Odin, characterised as the Terrible and Severe God, the Father of Carnage, the Avenger, is the principal deity of the Scan dinavians : from whose union with Frea, the heavenly mother, sprung various subordinate di vinities ; as Thor, who perpetually wars against Loke and his evil giants, who envy the power of u 3"], [322, "294 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. Odin, and seek to destroy his works. Among the inferior deities are the virgins of the Valhalla, whose office is to minister to the heroes in paradise. The favourites of Odin are all who die in battle, or, what is equally meritorious, by their own hand. The timid wretch, who allows himself to perish by disease or age, is unworthy of the joys of paradise. These joys are, fighting, ceaseless slaughter, and drinking beer out of the skulls of their enemies, with a renovation of life, to furnish a perpetuity of the same pleasures. 5. As the Scandinavians believed this world to be the work of some superior intelligences, so they held all nature to be constantly under the regulation of an Almighty will and power, and subject to a fixed and unalterable destiny. These notions had a wonderful effect on the national manners, and on the conduct of indi viduals. The Scandinavian placed his sole delight in war : he entertained an absolute con tempt of danger and of death, and his glory was estimated by the number he had slain in battle. The death-song of Regner Lodbrok, who com forts himself in his last agonies by recounting all the acts of carnage he had committed in his"], [323, "SECT. 47. 295 ANCIENT HISTORY. lifetime, is a faithful picture of the Scandinavian character. 6. We have remarked the great similarity of the manners of the Scandinavians and those of the ancient Germans. These nations seem, however, to have had a different origin. The Germans, as well as the Gauls, were branches of that great original nation termed Celt\u00e6, who inhabited most of the countries of Europe to the south of the Baltic, before they were invaded by the northern tribes from Scandinavia. The Celt\u00e6 were all of the Druidical religion; a sys tem which, though different from the belief and worship of the Scandinavians, is founded nearly on the same principles ; and the Goths, in their progress, intermixing with the Germans, could not fail to adopt, in part, the notions of a kindred religion. Druidism acknowledged a God that delighted in bloodshed ; it taught the immor tality of the soul, and inculcated the contempt of danger and of death: Ignavum reditur\u0153 parcere vit\u00e6. Tacitus remarks of the ancient Germans, that they had neither temples nor idols. The open air was the temple of the divi nity, and a consecrated grove the appropriated place for prayer and sacrifice, which none but the priests were allowed to enter. The chief sa. u 4"], [324, "296 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. crifices were human victims, most probably the prisoners taken in war. The Druids heightened the sanctity of their character by concealing the mysteries of their worship. They had the highest influence over the minds of the people, and thus found it easy to conjoin a civil au thority with the sacerdotal ; a policy which in the end led to the destruction of the Druidical system ; for the Romans found no other way of securing their conquests over any of the Celtic nations than by exterminating the Druids. 7. Whatever difference of manners there may have been among the various nations or tribes of Gothic origin, the great features of their cha racter appear to have been the same. Nature, education, and prevailing habits, all concurred to form them for an intrepid and conquering people. Their bodily frame, invigorated by the climate they inhabited, ever inured to danger and fatigue, war their habitual occupation, be lieving in an unalterable destiny, and taught by their religion, that a heroic sacrifice of life gave certain assurance of eternal happiness ; how could a race of men so characterised fail to be the conquerors of the world ?"], [325, "SECT. 48.

It has been erroneously imagined, that the same ferocity of manners which distinguished the Goths in their original seats attended their successors in their new establishments in the provinces of the Roman empire. Modern au thors have given a currency to this false idea. Voltaire, in describing the middle ages, paints the Goths in all the characters of horror ; as \" a troop of hungry wolves, foxes, and tigers, \" driving before them the scattered timid herds, \" and involving all in ruin and desolation.\" The accounts of historians most worthy of credit will dissipate this injurious prejudice, and show these northern nations in a more favourable point of view, as not unworthy to be the successors of the Romans. 2. Before the settlement in the southern provinces of Europe, the Goths were no longer idolaters, but Christians; and their morality,"], [326, "298 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. was suitable to the religion they professed. Salvianus, Bishop of Marseilles, in the fifth cen tury, draws a parallel between their manners and those of the Romans, highly to the credit of the former. Grotius, in his publication of Procopius and Jornandes, remarks, as a strong testimony to their honourable character as a nation, that no province once subdued by the Goths ever voluntarily withdrew itself from their government. 3. It is not possible to produce a more beautiful picture of an excellent administration than that of the Gothic monarchy in Italy under Theo doric the Great. Although master of the country by conquest, he was regarded by his subjects with the affection of a native sovereign. He retained the Roman laws, and as nearly as possible the ancient political regulations. In supplying all civil offices of state, he preferred the native Romans. It was his care to preserve every monument of the ancient grandeur of the empire, and to embellish the cities by new works of beauty and utility. In the imposition and levying of taxes, he showed the most humane indulgence on every occasion of scarcity or calamity. His laws were dictated by the most enlightened prudence and benevolence, and"], [327, "SECT. 48. ANCIENT HISTORY. 299 framed on that principle which he nobly incul cated in his instructions to the Roman senate, Benigni principis est, non tarn delicta velle punire, quam tollere. The historians of the times delight in recounting the examples of his munificence and humanity. Partial as he was to the Arian heresy, many even of the Catholic Fathers have done the most ample justice to his merits, ac knowledging that, under his reign, the church enjoyed a high measure of prosperity. [By fixing, however, upon Ravenna as the seat of govern ment, he gave the greater scope to the Popes for establishing their authority in Rome.] Such was Theodoric the Great, who is justly termed, by Sidonius Apollinaris, Roman\u0153 decus columen que gentis. 4. But a single - example could not warrant a general inference with regard to the merits of a whole people. The example of Theodoric is not single. If it does not find a complete parallel, it is at least nearly approached to in the similar characters of Alaric, Amalasonte, and Totila. Alaric, compelled by his enemy's breach of faith to revenge himself by the sack of Rome, showed, even in that revenge, a noble example of humanity. No blood was shed without ne cessity ; the churches were inviolable asylums ;"], [328, "300 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. the honour of the women was preserved; the treasures of the city were saved from plunder. Amalasonte, the daughter of Theodoric, re- paired to her subjects the loss of her father, by the equity and wisdom of her administration. She trained her son to the study of literature and of every polite accomplishment, as the best means of reforming and enlightening his people. Totila, twice master of Rome, which he won by his arms after an obstinate resistance, imitated the example of Alaric in his clemency to the vanquished, and in his care to preserve every remnant of ancient magnificence from destruc tion. He restored the senate to its authority ; he adorned Rome with useful edifices, regulated its internal policy, and took a noble pride in reviving the splendour and dignity of the empire. Habitavit cum Romanis, says a contemporary author, tanquam pater cum f His. 5. The stem of the Gothic nation divided itself into two great branches, the Ostrogoths, who remained in Pannonia, and the Westrogoths or Visigoths, so termed from their migrating thence to the west of Europe. Italy was pos sessed by the latter under Alaric, and by the former under Theodoric. The Visigoths, after the death of Alaric, withdrew into Gaul, and"], [329, "SECT. 48. ANCIENT HISTORY. 301 obtained from Honorius the province of Aqui taine, of which Thoulouse was the capital. When expelled from that province by the Franks, they crossed the Pyrenees, and, settling in Spain, made Toledo the capital of their kingdom. The race of the Visigoth princes was termed the Balti, as that of the Ostrogoths the Amali. The Ostrogoths enforced in their dominions the observance of the Roman laws ; the Visigoths adhered to a code compiled by their own sove reigns, and founded on the ancient manners and usages of their nations. From this code, there fore, we may derive much information relative to the genius and character of this ancient people. 6. It is enacted by the Laws of the Visigoths that no judge shall decide in any lawsuit unless he finds in that book a law applicable to the case. All causes that fall not under this description are reserved for the decision of the sovereign. The penal laws are severe, but tempered with great equity. No punishment can affect the heirs of the criminal ; omnia crimina suos sequan tur auctores \u2014 ille solus judiceter culpabilis qui culpanda commiserit, et crimen cum illo quifecerit moriatur. Death was the punishment of the murder of a freeman, and perpetual infamy of"], [330, "302 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. the murder of a slave. \u2014 Pecuniary fines were enacted for various subordinate offences, accord- ing to their measure of criminality. \u2014 An adul- terer was delivered in bondage to the injured husband; and the free woman who had com- mitted adultery with a married man became the slave of his wife. \u2014 No physician was allowed to visit a female patient, but in the presence of her nearest kindred. \u2014 The Lex talionis was in great observance for such injuries as admitted of it. It was even carried so far, that the incendiary of a house was burnt alive. \u2014 The trials by judi- cial combat, by ordeal, and by the judgment of God, which were in frequent use among the Franks and Normans, had no place among the Visigoths. \u2014 Montesquieu has erroneously as- serted, that in all the Gothic nations it was usual to judge the litigants by the law of their own country; the Roman by the Roman law, the Frank by that of the Franks, the Aleman by that of the Alemans. On the contrary, the Vi- sigoth code prohibits the laws of all other nations within the territories of that people ; Nolumus sive Romanis legibus, sive alienis institutionibus, amplius convexari. The laws of the Franks and Lombards are remarkable for their wisdom and judicious policy."], [331, "SECT. 48. 303 ANCIENT HISTORY. 7. The government of the Goths, after their settlement in the Roman provinces, was monar chical ; and, at first elective, became afterwards hereditary ; the sovereign on his death-bed appointing his successors, with the advice or consent of his grandees. Illegitimacy did not disqualify from succession or nomination to the throne. 8. The Dukes and Counts were the chief officers under the Gothic government. The Duke (Dux exercitus) was the commander-in chief of the troops of the province ; the Count (Comes) was the highest civil magistrate ; but these officers frequently intermixed their func tions ; the Count being empowered, on sudden emergencies, to assume a military command, and the Duke, on some occasions, warranted to exercise judicial authority. In general, however, their departments were distinct. Of Comites there were various orders, with distinct official powers ; as, Comes cubiculi, Chamberlain ; Comes stabuli, Constable, &c. These various officers were the proceres or grandees of the kingdom, by whose advice the sovereign conducted him self in important matters of government, or in the nomination of his successor : but we do not find that they had a voice in the framing of laws,"], [332, "PART I. 304 ANCIENT HISTORY. or in the imposition of taxes ; and the prince himself had the sole nomination to all offices of government, magistracies, and dignities. [When the Gothic tribes settled themselves in the pro vinces of the Roman empire, and became Chris tians, a new order, namely, the Bishops, were admitted to the council of the Sovereign, as will be seen hereafter.] XLIX. METHOD OF STUDYING ANCIENT HISTORY. 1. A general and concise view of ancient history may be acquired by the perusal of a very few books : as that part of the Cours d' Etude of the Abbe Condillac which regards the history of the nations of antiquity ; the Elements of General History by the Abbe Millot, part 1. ; the Epitome of Turselline, with the notes of L'Agneau, part 1. ; or the excellent Compendium Histori\u0153 Universalis, by Professor Offerhaus of Groningen. The two first of these works have the merit of uniting a spirit of reflection with a judicious selection of events. The notes of"], [333, "SECT. 49. ANCIENT HISTORY. 305 L'Agneau to the Epitome of Turselline, contain a great store of geographical and biographical information; and the work of Offerhaus is peculiarly valuable, as uniting sacred with pro fane history, and containing most ample re ferences to the ancient authors. The Discours sur I'Histoire Universelle, by the Bishop of Meaux, though a work of high merit, is rather useful to those who have already studied history in detail, for uniting in the mind the great current of events, and recalling to the memory their order and connection, than fitted to convey information to the uninstructed. But the student who wishes to derive the most complete advantage from history, must not confine himself to such general or compendious views ; he must resort to the original historians of ancient times, and the modern writers who have treated with amplitude of particular periods. It may be useful to such students to point out the order in which those historians may be most profitably perused. 2. Next to the historical books of the Old Testament, the most ancient history worthy of perusal is that of Herodotus, which comprehends the annals of Lydia, Ionia, Lycia, Egypt, Persia, VOL. I. x"], [334, "306 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. Greece, and Macedonia, from about 700 years to 479 B.C. Book 1. Contains the History of Lydia from Gyges to Cr\u0153sus ; Ancient Ionia ; Manners of the Persians, Babylonians, &c. ; History of Cyrus the Elder. B. 2. History of Egypt, and Manners of the Egyptians. B. 3. History of Cambyses. \u2014 Persian Mo narchy under Darius Hystaspes. B. 4. History of Scythia. B. 5. Persian Embassy to Macedon ; Athens, Laced\u00e6mon, Corinth, at the same period. B. 6. Kings of Laced\u00e6mon. \u2014 War of Persia against Greece, to the Battle of Marathon. B. 7- The same War to the Battle of Ther mopyl\u00e6. B. 8. The naval Battle of Salamis. B. 9. The Defeat and Expulsion of the Persians from Greece. (The merits of Herodotus are shortly charac terised supra, Sect. XXII. \u00a7 1.) 3. A more particular account of the periods treated by Herodotus may be found in Justin, lib. 1, 2, 3. and %; the Cyrop\u00e6dia of Xenophon; the lives of Aristides, Themistocles, Cimon, Miltiades, and Pausanias, written by Plutarch"], [335, "SECT. 49. 307 ANCIENT HISTORY. and Cornelius Nepos ; and those of Anaxi mander, Zeno, Empedocles, Heraclitus, and Democritus, by Diogenes Laertius. 4. The Grecian History is taken up by Thu cydides from the period where Herodotus ends, and is continued for seventy years, to the twenty first of the Peloponnesian war. (This work characterised, Sect. XXII. \u00a7 2.) The period he treats of is more amply illustrated by perusing the 11th and 12th books of Diodorus Siculus ; the lives of Alcibiades, Chabrias, Thrasybulus, and Lysias, by Plutarch and Nepos ; the 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th books of Justin, and 14th and 15th chapters of the first book of Orosius. 5. Next to Thucydides, the student ought to peruse the 1st and 2d books of Xenophon's History of Greece, which comprehends the nar rative of the Peloponnesian war, with the con temporary history of the Medes and Persians ; then the expedition of Cyrus (Anabasis), and the continuation of the history to its conclusion with the battle of Mantinea. (Xenophon charac terised, Sect. XXII. \u00a7 3.) For illustrating this period, we have the lives of Lysander, Agesilaus, Artaxerxes, Conon, and Datames, by Plutarch and Nepos; the 4th, 5th, and 6th books of x 2"], [336, "308 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. Justin ; and the 13th and 14th of Diodorus Siculus. 6. After Xenophon, let the student read the 15th and 16th books of Diodorus, which con tain the history of Greece and Persia, from the battle of Mantinea, to the reign of Alex ander the Great. (Diodorus characterised, Sect. XXII. \u00a7 5.) To complete this period, let him read the lives of Dion, Iphicrates, Timo theus, Phocion, and Timoleon, by Nepos. 7. For the history of Alexander the Great, we have the admirable works of Arrian and Quintus Curtius. (The former characterised, Sect. XXII. \u00a7 8.) Curtius possesses great judgment in the selection of facts, with much elegance and perspicuity of diction. He is a good moralist and a good patriot ; but his passion for embellishment derogates from the purity of history, and renders his authority suspicious. 8. For the continuation of the history of Greece from the death of Alexander, we have the 18th, 19th, and 20th books of Diodorus; and the history of Justin from the 13th book downwards ; together with the lives of the prin cipal personages, written by Plutarch. The history of Justin is a most judicious abridgment"], [337, "SECT. 49. ANCIENT HISTORY. 309 of a much larger work by Trojus Pompeius, which is lost. Justin excels in the delineation of characters, and in purity of style. 9. I have mentioned the lives of Plutarch and Cornelius Nepos as the best supplement to the account of particular periods of ancient history.- It is the highest praise of Plutarch, that his. writings breathe the most admirable morality,. and furnish the most instructive lessons of active virtue. He makes us familiarly acquainted- with the great men of antiquity, and chiefly delights in painting their private character and manners. The short lives written by Nepos show great judgment, and a most happy selection of such facts as display the genius and character of his heroes. They are written likewise with great purity and elegance. 10. For the Roman history in its early pe riods, we have, first, the Antiquities of Diony sius of Halicarnassus, which bring down the history of Rome to 412 A.U.C. They are chiefly valuable, as illustrating the manners and customs, the rites, civil and religious, and the laws of the Roman state. But the writer is too apt to frame hypotheses, and to give views instead of narratives. We look for these in the modern writers who treat of ancient times, x 3"], [338, "310 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. but we cannot tolerate them in the sources of history. 11. The work of Livy is infinitely more valu- able ; a perfect model of history, both as to matter and composition. (Characterised, Sect. XXXVI. \u00a7 10.) Of 132 books, we have only remaining 35, and these interrupted by a consi- derable chasm. The first decade (or ten books) treats of a period of 460 years ; the second de- cade, containing seventy-five years, is lost ; the third contains the second Punic war, including eighteen years ; the fourth contains the war against Philip of Macedon, and the Asiatic war against Antiochus, a space of twenty-three years ; of the fifth decade there are only five books ; and the remainder, which reaches to the death of Drusus, 746 A. U. C, has, together with the second decade, been supplied by Frein- shemius. To supply the chasm of the second decade, the student ought to read, together with the epitome of those lost books, the first and second books of Polybius; the 17th, 18th, 22d, and 23d books of Justin ; the lives of Mar cellus and Fabius Maximus by Plutarch ; and the Punic and Illyrian wars by Appian. 12. But the history of Polybius demands a separate and attentive perusal, as an admirable"], [339, "SECT. 49. 311 ANCIENT HISTORY. compendium of political and military instruction. Of forty books of general history we have only five entire, and excerpts of the following twelve. The matter of which he treats is the history of the Romans, and the nations with whom they were at war, from the beginning of the second Punic war to the beginning of the war with Ma cedonia, comprising in all a period of about fifty years. Of the high estimation in which Poly bius stood with the authors of antiquity, we have sufficient proof in the encomiums bestowed on him by Cicero, Strabo, Josephus, and Plutarch ; and in the use which Livy has made of his his tory, in adopting his narratives in many parts of his work, by an almost literal translation. 13. The work of Appian, which originally consisted of twenty books, from the earliest period of the Roman history down to the age of Adrian, is greatly mutilated; there remain ing only his account of the Syrian, Parthian, Mithridatic, Spanish, Punic, and Illyrian wars. His narrative of each of these wars is remarkably distinct and judicious, and his composition, on the whole, is chaste and perspicuous. After the history of Appian, the student should resume Livy, from the beginning of the third decade, or 21st book, to the end. Then he may peruse x 4"], [340, "312 PART I. ANCIENT HISTORY. with advantage the lives of Hannibal, Scipio Africanus, Flaminius, Paulus \u00c6milius, the elder Cato, the Gracchi, Marius, Sylla, the younger Cato, Sertorius, Lucullus, Julius C\u00e6sar, Cicero, Pompey, and Brutus, by Plutarch. 14. The histories of the Jugurthine war, and the conspiracy of Catiline by Sallust, come next in order. (Sallust characterised, Sect. XXXVI. \u00a7 8.) Then follow the Com mentaries of C\u00e6sar, (Sect. XXXVI. \u00a7 9.) re markable for perspicuity of narration and a happy union of brevity with elegant simplicity of style. The epitomes of Floras and of Velleius Paterculus (the latter a model for abridgment of history) may be perused with advantage at this period of the course. [Cicero, as a living witness of some of the most extraordinary events that took place in the last struggles of the republic, and as an actor in many of them, of singular abilities, knowledge, and discernment, supplies us, particularly in the second book of his Offices, and familiar Letters, with information of the very highest importance, political, historical, and philosophical.] 15. For the history of Rome under the first Emperors we have Suetonius and Tacitus ; [both"], [341, "SECT. 49. ANCIENT HISTORY'. 313 authors of what has been called the Silver Age of Latinity ;] and for the subsequent reigns, the series of the minor historians, termed Histori\u00e6 August\u0153 Scriptores, and the Byzantine writers. Sueto nius rather gives us a series of detached cha racters, illustrated by an artful selection of facts and anecdotes, than a regular history. His work is chiefly valuable as descriptive of Roman manners, though his genius has too much of the caustic humour of a satirist. Tacitus, with greater powers and deeper penetration, (see Sect. XXXVI. \u00a711.) has drawn his picture of the times in stern and gloomy colours. From neither of these historians will the ingenuous mind of youth receive moral improvement, or pleasing or benevolent impressions ; yet we cannot deny their high utility to the student of politics. 16. If we except Herodian, who wrote with taste and judgment, it is doubtful whether any of the subsequent writers of the Roman history deserve a minute perusal. It were pref ! able that the student should derive his knowled.,\"_ of the history of the decline and fall of the** .:, re from modern authors, resorting to the or al writers only for occasional information on de-"], [342, "314 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. tached points of importance. For this purpose, the General History by Dr. Howel is a work of very high utility, as being written entirely on the basis of the original historians, whose nar rative he in general translates, referring con stantly to his authorities in the margin. The student will find in this work a most valuable mass of historical information. 17. The reader, having thus founded his knowledge of general history on the original writers, will now peruse with great advantage the modern histories of ancient Greece and Rome, by the able pens of Mitford, Gillies, Gast, Hooke, Gibbon, and Fergusson, and will find himself qualified to form a just estimate of their merits, on which (though too frequently the practice) it is presumptuous to decide without such preparatory knowledge. 18. The greatest magazine of historical in formation which has ever been collected into one body, is the English Universal History ; a most useful work, from the amplitude of its matter, its general accuracy, and constant re ference to the original authors. We may occa sionally consult it with great advantage on points where deep research is necessary; but we cannot read it with pleasure as a continued work, from"], [343, "SECT. 49. 315 ANCIENT HISTORY. its tedious details and harshness of style, as well as from its abrupt transitions, and the injudicious arrangement of many of its parts. 19. Geography and chronology have been justly termed the lights of history. We cannot peruse with advantage the historical annals of any country without a competent notion of its geographical site, and even of its particular topo graphy. In reading the description of all events, the mind necessarily pictures out the scenes of action ; and these it is surely better to draw with truth from nature and reality, than falsely from imagination. Many actions and events are like wise intimately connected with the geography and local circumstances of a country, and are unintelligible without a knowledge of them. 20. The use of chronological tables is very great, both for the purpose of uniting in one view the contemporary events in different na tions, which often have an influence on each other, and for recalling to the memory the order and series of events, and renewing the impres sions of the objects of former study. It is ex tremely useful, after perusing the history of a nation in detail, or that of a certain age or period, to run over briefly the principal occur rences in a table of Chronology. The most"], [344, "316 ANCIENT HISTORY. PART I. perfect works of this kind are the chronological tables of Dr. Playfair, which unite history and biography ; the tables of Dr. Blair ; or the older tables by Tallent.
