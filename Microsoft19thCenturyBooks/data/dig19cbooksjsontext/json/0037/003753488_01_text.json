The world Avas bright with Spring sunshine, which Avas aAvakening to new life the floAvers and grass soaa'u in the eternal sequence of Nature. But amid the earth's joyousness a chord of sadness vibrated through the hearts of those gazing from the windows of the country rectory of Slade ; sad with the knoAAledge that the vital sap of Spring would in no AA'ise restore to health a loved AA'ise and mother. Mrs. Lesley lay on a sofa facing the AAdndoAv, Avhile her only daughter, Bertha, stood breathing VOL.

My heart would have broken not to have been Avith my OAA'n dear, suffering miitterchen.\" \" Still, you miss a friend Avith bold un trammelled thoughts, Bertha, and have come back to responsibility and loneliness. Oh ! child, you will be good to Louis Avhen I am gone, and try to like the restraints of a clergyman's life for your father's sake,\" AAras the sad appeal of the mother. \" As to Louis, he shall ahvays be my care,\" AA'as Bertha's ready promise ; \" but I cannot practice Avhat I knoAv nothing of; and, mother, you have never been a curate in petticoats, and AA'hy should I, because my father is ordained, act a lie . \" B\u2014 2"], [16, "4 DOCTOR, OR LOVER 1 \" No ; and Bertha, you Avill never run to the other extreme, never let your spirit of liberty and genuineness cast aside all reason, will you, dear .\" The one ansAver Avas a prolonged kiss, and then, Avith a feAV admonitory words as to quiet and rest, Bertha Lesley left the room. A fortnight later, and Mrs. Lesley passed to a brighter and more peaceful certainty of rest than any amount of love and care can procure on this earth. Louis Lesley, the idol of the dying mother's heart, had received a hasty summons from Cambridge ; and bitterly did his mother realise Avhat her death would be to her son and daughter ; while Louis at the bed side gave way to impotent grief, and even Mr. Lesley seemed to become selfish in the sorroAv of the moment, so that the last desire was spoken to Bertha : \" Take care of them both, and never leave them so long as they miss me, child.\" And as the soul left its earthly tenement,"], [17, "5 MOTHER AND DAUGHTER. Bertha had comforted her mother AA'ith the assurance : \" My life is theirs, mother \u2014 and you Avill pray for me . \" And AA'ith a kiss those lips AA'ere sealed until, in the probation of the soul, they breathed a prayer for and listened to the chants of those left behind to struggle onwards to the same merciful rest. Now AA'e must leave Slade Rectory, to return, after the lapse of two years. Up to this period Bertha Lesley's responsible post as head of her father's household had been both easy and pleasant to fulfil. The Reverend Charles Lesley was a clergyman of more than the average brain power found among members of the cloth, and on the basis that veneration is natural to the human mind, used practical goodness and even ordinary subjects to shoAv forth the reality of his Catholic faith. \"With such a father, Bertha found that the parish required no interference"], [18, "6 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? from herself except the material gifts emanating from a Avell ordered kitchen. As regards her only brother, the long vacation AA'as the only time he had been at Slade since their mother's death. But hoav Louis was leaving Cambridge for good, his college life having come to an end, AA'ith little apparent benefit, except the monetary support afforded to an ancient institution. For no one could have studied less than Louis Lesley during the three years he Avas up, and he had only been alloAved his ordinary. Noav he Avas coming to Slade for a year, AA7hen, haA'ing made himself acquainted AA'ith the parish, he would be ordained and succeed his father in the living, in the due order of an entailed family estate. Soon after returning home, Louis had asked the one friend his college life had given him to come for the Christmas time to stay at Slade. This friend was Karl Troika, of Russian parentage, but English education. Having finished his University career just twelve months before"], [19, "MOTHER AXD DAUGHTER. 7 Louis, and being four years his senior in age, Troika, with all the intensity of his Slavonic ancestry had bent Louis Lesley's Aveak will from the very first, and persuaded him to become a Freemason, though only just one and twenty ; but Karl's appointment as third Secretary at the Russian Embassy had separated them for awhile. Bertha, on the day of this stranger's arrival AA'as quite as expectant as Louis, for her brother had roused all a woman's curiosity, and all a young girl's intolerance as regards this Anglo- Russian ; and at the present moment sister and brother Avere still eagerly discussing him. \" Troika is about as unlike me as can be. He hates ladies' society, and is only at his ease AA'hen talking politics ; but I hope the governor Avill give us none of his Conservative twaddle, or there'll be an explosion, for Troika is so broad minded.\" Louis Lesley explained. \" Narrow, I suppose you mean, Louis,\" ansAvered Bertha ; and as for putting up with"], [20, "8 DOCTOR, OR LOVER . father's opinions, I think .it would be better to reverse the sentence.\" \" Well, Troika never leaves anyone who is Avorth convincing alone ; he's not like me, con tent to let live aaIio may.\" \" Then he has not considered your views worthy of alteration .\" And a smile passed over Bertha's face. \" I'm not so sure about that, but he hates opinionated females, Bertha ; so take care Troika never finds AA'hat a Democrat you are \u2014 not that he ever condescends to talk to girls.\" \" Indeed ! Well, avc can do very well without such a bear. I suppose Mr. Troika can admire inane innocents aaIio are as deep as they are foolish.\" And again Bertha turned teasingly to her brother, Avho retorted : \" If you mean Lilie Marsh, you're mistaken, for Karl Troika is a regular misogamist, and you'll be clever to find out any weakness of his.\" There"], [21, "9 THE TABLES TURNED. the discussion rested, and Bertha Avas set at heart in proving to Louis that this demi-god, Karl Troika, Avas fallible, and, therefore, made up her mind to exert herself, and entertain him, and AA'hen she had proved this Troika but as other men, to revenge herself on Louis."], [22, "10 DOCTOR, OR LOVER. CHAPTER II. THE TABLES TURNED. The afternoon of the following day found Bertha Lesley aAvaiting her brother's return, he having driven to the station to meet Karl Troika. At the appointed time for returning, Louis entered the drawing-room alone, causing his sister to enquire : \" So the misogamist has not come . Even the fear of one poor creature Avearing long clothes has been too much for him ! \" \" Don't be absurd, Bertha. Of course Troika came, but that infernal tobacconist never gave the guard my weed, and there's not a piece of decent stuff in the house, so I'm off again \" \u2014 and Louis Lesley closed the door AA'ith a bang,"], [23, "THE TABLES TURNED. 11 leaving Bertha standing, as AA'hen he entered, near the high window: Ten minutes later, and the door Avas again opened, this time to admit Louis' friend, Karl Troika \u2014 and Bertha turned to greet him with the words : \" Louis has gone out, so I must introduce myself, Mr. Troika, unless you already knoAv my brother has only one sister ; \" and Bertha smiled, determined to carry out her little ruse of agreeable hostess. Karl Troika murmured something about it being too bad of Louis, and then gazed at his OAvn shoe leather. But Bertha Lesley's precon ceived railleries died on her lips, so thoughtful a broAv and so tired a look had the young Anglo- Russian. Fortunately, the Rector interrupted the pause, by his entrance, AA'ith the cheery Avelcome : \" Glad to see one AA'ho is such a friend of my boy's ; and I hope, betAA'een us, we shall make your stay at Slade a pleasant one, Mr. Troika.\""], [24, "12 DOCTOR, OR LOVER . \" Thanks. I never depend on companionship ; so long as my books are in my bag, no place can be dull,\" Avas the dry ansAver. \" Come, come ! in my young days,\" AA'as the Rector's not over pleased remark, \"AA'e should have thought of our hostess first, and our books after. Why, even noAvyou are missing a chance of making your peace ! Come, Bertha, your old father after all must be your lot.\" And Mr. Lesley gave his arm to his daughter, dinner having been announced, Avhile Karl Troika let the opportunity of gaining the good AA'ill of his host slip by. But not treating his remark as a joke, and biting his under lip in sheer annoyance, he folloAved Louis, aaIio rushed cloAA'n stairs at the last moment. SomehoAv, that evening seemed interminable to Bertha, and yet Louis and his friend spent the greater part of it in the smoking-room, and came in only a short time before prayers, or rather, the reading of three psalms, for the benefit of all aaIio Avere not too sleepy to profit"], [25, "THE TABLES TURNED. 13 by the third, ere they retired to their legitimate rest. \" What a different man to AA'hat I expected,\" Avas Bertha Lesley's thought the folloAving morning, as she sat alone working. Yet it Avould have puzzled that young lady to have shoAvn where the difference lay ; for a cabinet photograph of Karl Troika, which had stood on Louis' dressing table, had familiarised Bertha Avith the grave handsome features, the thick moustache and massive eyebroAvs of this young man, and the conversation at the breakfast table had but confirmed Louis' statements as regards his friend's Socialistic opinions and abhorrence of Conservatism. Was it then in his conduct as regards members of the gentler sex . Surely not, for Karl Troika had never shown his right to the title of a gentleman by one small attention, and certainly no compliment had passed his lips. Nevertheless, it Avas here that the difference lay; for this Anglo-Russian, ignoring the ordinary"], [26, "14 DOCTOR, OR LOA'ER. idea of a AA'oman's inferior intellect, included Bertha in the arguments as equally able to converse as her father and brother, so that the sarcastic speeches she \u2014 Bertha \u2014 had prepared for some vainglorious puppy, lost all their sting. \" Sitting in such a morning as this, Bertha! \" exclaimed the Rector, as he came to the morning room in search of The Times. \" Why, Rore will be eating his head off if you take to stopping in so. \" I knoAv, father, but I thought you Avould ride Avith me if I Avaited till after luncheon \u2014 that is, if the District Visitors don't imprison you,\" AA'as Bertha's reply. \" You Avicked Turk, they have the Curate now, remember ; but Louis should have taken you, only this young bear takes up all his time. Ah ! well, Ave all have our tastes, but this Karl Troika is certainly not to my mind,\" and Mr. Lesley settled himself comfortably in an armchair to read. At luncheon, Louis mentioned their having"], [27, "15 THE TABLES TURNED. ridden to Court Leas. This AA'as a county seat belonging to a Mr. Tom Marsh, Avho, by dint of Scotch shreAvduess, had made a collossal fortune out of bricks and mortar. An explanation of this caused Mr. Lesley to remark : \" And saAv Tom Marsh, I hope, for in him you have your Liberal theories practically exemplified, Air. Troika ; and yet, twenty years hence, that man will have only one desire, and that is, to be respectable enough to turn Conservative.\" \" Indeed!\" Avas young Troika's comment. \" I certainly saw Mr. Marsh, and he struck me as being highly respectable.\" \" I am glad you think so, but he has no idea hoAV to treat his tenants, and is a Liberal, not from any principle, but because his money was made out of a Liberal Ministry.\" \" And even then, I think Mr. Marsh is better with his Liberalism than without.\" \" There my father will agree AA'ith you,\" put in"], [28, "16 DOCTOR, OR LOVER. Bertha, \" he believes in no man who hides Ms opinions ; the open enemy is ever liable to be conquered. Is not he, father . \" But to Bertha's surprise, the appeal met with no support from Mr. Lesley, avIio ansAvered : \" No, Bertha, no false opinions should be tolerated. Voltaire's expression of revolutionary ideas did more than a thousand and one secret societies to compass the ruin of France.\" \" You think so . \" eagerly questioned Troika. \" Well, it will ever seem to me that to meet an evil Avith full knoAA'ledge of its extent, is to conquer it. And as regards a country, it can never remain stationary ; and, therefore, to make liberty and progress perfect in his day, is the duty of every man.\" \" You make such sAveeping assertions, sir,\" Avas the Rector's vexed reply, \" that I do not care to argue the question any longer.\" \" That's right, father, for Karl has practical"], [29, "THE TABLES TURNED. 17 proof for his assertions, and you can hardly expect him to accept your old theories.\" Louis evidently prided himself in putting the closure on so neatly, but Bertha took up the cudgels indignantly. \" Hoav dare you call anyone's theories old, knoAA'ing so little as you do, Louis . And as for your friend, he knoAvs about as much as you, and takes every Avord the last public speaker chose to use as so much gospel truth.\" The Rector seem rather vexed at the vehement tone his daughter spoke in, but the only notice the stranger took, Avas a slight elevation of the eyebroAvs, just as the Frenchman employs his hausser les epaules ; AA'hile Louis remarked : \" What a pity you have AA'asted so much zeal, noAV ; if the Marshes had been present, it might have been appreciated. But AA'hy not have come AA'ith us this morning . \" \" Simply because I did not knoAv you intended calling on Lilie Marsh.\" VOL. I. c"], [30, "18 DOCTOR, OR LOVER? Now, this AAas a home thrust for Louis Lesley, AA-ho, AA'hile entertaining a deep admiration for the young lady in question, AAas very adverse to acknoAvledging the slightest partiality in that quarter, owing to the large fortune Lilie Marsh AA'as knoAA-n to be heiress to. So Louis replied, crossly: \" When I do call on Miss Marsh I will tell you beforehand ; but Karl will tell you that Avas not the object of our visit to Court Leas this morning.\" \" Oh ! for that matter, old fellow,\" laughed Troika, \" I can't say AA'hat Ave Avent for ; but if that pretty piece of simplicity is Miss Marsh, I fancy you forgot the object in the reality, for, at any rate, I saAv nothing else.\" A laugh from Bertha, and the subject dropped ; but just before they left the luncheon table a question from Mr. Lesley, as to Avhat time the horses Avere to come round, roused Louis' curiosity, and to his enquiry as to where they were off to, Bertha replied :"], [31, "19 THE TABLES TURNED. \" Only for a ride ; father and I arranged it this morning.\" \" Then Troika may as Avell go AA'ith you, as I'm due at the club.

Y'ou knoAv Rore cannot go Avell with a fresh horse.\" \" Then leave me out by all means. I should not like to spoil your ride by my presence.\" And Troika laid a stress on the last AA'ords. Y\"et as they left the dining room he asked the butler as he passed out Avhat time the horses AA'ere ordered for. \"Three o'clock, sir,\" ansAA'eredthat functionary; and Karl joined Louis in the smoking room. The steeds stood at the hall door punctually to the hour: the Rector's horse, a broad-backed weight carrier, and Rore, a dark bay about c\u2014 2"], [32, "20 DOCTOR, OR LOA'ER. fourteen and a half hands, to all appearances a veritable lamb as he arched his neck to Karl Troika's caresses. Mr. Lesley, with a stalworth hunting crop, and Avearing a respectable chimney-pot, under which one may hide a Avell-developed and states manlike skull, was the first of the tAvo riders to appear, and, seeing the young Anglo-Russian Avith one of the ordinary crush hats of the day, remarked : \" So you're not coming with us . or do you young men ride in those frying-pans of hats I They never could have been introduced if brains had remained in fashion.\" \" No, I'm not coming, sir,\" and Karl gave a quiet smile as Bertha Lesley came toAvards her horse, and coming forward, held his hand for her to mount. Involuntarily Bertha vaulted into her saddle, and then, noticing Karl arranging the stirrup, it flashed to her thoughts hoAV she had voAved to treat this man differently from"], [33, "21 THE TABLES TURNED. others ; and she hastily exclaimed, \" How forget ful of me ! Y'ou are doing the groom's work, and that Avill necessitate my thanking you, Mr. Troika, Avhereas if the proper person had done it I should have been spared that trouble.\" \" Why not leaA'e the thanks alone 1 A groom Avho does his duty deserves it much more in my opinion than any one stepping in for mere pleasure. Perhaps one day you AA'ill think, as I do, all equal ; but till then I must expect to be misunderstood and debarred from the pleasure of your ride, not by Rore, but by her mistress.\" The parting Avords might have easily been lost to less attentive ears, but Bertha Lesley took in their fullest meaning, and an angry flush sprang to her face as she realised hoAv fully this man had seen through her, and hoAV much he despised such feminine subterfuge."], [34, "DOCTOR, OR LOVER . 22 CHAPTER III. TO THE LETTER OF THE LAW It Avas Karl Troika's first Sunday at Slade, and as he gave a last tAA'irl to his moustache before leaving the glass, such a grimace distorted his face that no one could have recognised the OAvner as a more than ordinarily handsome man ; but Karl's thoughts Avere in accord, for they ran as folloAvs : \" Sunday. I should think a regular Avet blanket ; still, if Louis oggles that pretty little Marsh girl, I shall talk politics with the sister, in spite of the gratuitous information that they are a forbidden subject on the Seventh Day.\" These thoughts had been called up by Louis, who had just left his friend's bedroom, after"], [35, "23 TO THE LETTER OF THE LAW. telling him that Mr. Lesley had long ago enforced a Sunday rule of no discussion of any kind on that day. Now, the Rector had done this in sheer self defence on Bertha Lesley's return from Ger many ; for Louis being home from college, these tAA'o had plucked his pulpit orations of all their oratorical splendour, and tested them AA'ith the fire of plain common sense. So, for the future, every one Avas alloAved the glorious liberty of keeping their opinions to themselves on the Sabbath and airing them on Monday, the result being that they lost all their keen interest and not a little of the satire that otherwise would have flavoured them. One duty the Rector's daughter took upon herself con amove, and that was playing upon the organ at the Sunday services, and in this way Bertha Lesley escaped from the amount of small talk so pleasing to members of congrega tions in general. But the Misses Price, head of"], [36, "24 DOCTOR, OR LOVER . the district-visiting clan, could have exempted Miss Lesley from the office of organist, as the curate, the Reverend Ebenezer Reel, invariably came from the Vestry, and took upon himself the deputy-organist post by arranging the music for the next service and going to dine at the Rectory. On this particular Sunday Mr. Lesley preached on Sodom and Gomorrah, turning his text to a very practical conclusion by warning his parishioners not to destroy their bees in the brimstone pit, or they justly deserved a foretaste of AA'hat he AA'as about to give them. And to Karl Troika's utter amazement, the clerk, aa'Iio sat near the pulpit, approached the square stove for warming the church, and sliding back the flat iron top, sprinkled the contents of a packet of sulphur on the red-hot coke ! A cloud of smoke of a most suffocating kind made Karl press his handkerchief into service ; but, except for Louis, all the parish ioners seemed unconcerned, so true is it that"], [37, "TO THE LETTER OF THE LAW. 25 constant deviations from the beaten track become accepted facts. \" We'll go as soon as possible,\" AA'hispered Louis, annoyed beyond measure at the practical illustration of his father's t3xt ; but Karl simply gave a dry cough by way of reply, and, when the close of the service was reached, ansAvered : \" I've been A'astly edified, my dear felloAv, and intend Avaiting out your sister's voluntary. But those Court Lea folks are Avaiting for you, arn't they . so look sharp.\" And Louis, Avho little guessed that Karl had made a random shot at what he expected AA'as the rule rather than the exception, hastened out of the seat. Troika waited, and in a very short time the last countryman banged his way out. Then he got up and went toAvards the organ, remarking to Bertha, aa'Iio AA'as still engaged on Mozart's TAvelfth Mass : \" That is a glorious voluntary. I suppose you have never heard it any other way, Miss Lesley.\""], [38, "26 DOCTOR, OR LOVER . \"No; but you are scarcely English in your taste, Mr. Troika, or you would have scuttled out of church before the first bar had been played.\" \" Should I ?

As they left the Church the Rector detained the visitor to sIioav him some architectural curiosity in the AYest AvindoAv ; but Karl, Avho Avas not over pleased at the arrangement, Avalked so quickly that they soon joined Aliss Lesley and the Curate, AA'ho AA'as just speaking, expressing his regret at the backAA-ardness of of the choir bovs."], [39, "TO THE LETTER OF THE LAAV 27 \" I regret the choir not getting up that anthem, even noAV, Miss Lesley.\" \" I certainly never expected them to, Mr. Reel,\" replied Bertha, \" there is a very poor chance of a country choir taking to more than one tune during a lifetime in my opinion.\" \" And you think what is true, Miss Lesley,'' interposed Karl. \" Any one entertaining the idea that country lads might become imbued Avith the enthusiasm of the organist in this case must be incapable of appreciating the worth of the music.\" The Curate looked blackly at Air.

But the Rector was not so easily put off the scent of coining evil, for he added : \" I little thought of you, Bertha, as an advocate on this Anglo-Russian's part ; but, at anv rate, Louis, as usual, finds a warm defender in you, eA'en AA'hen his friends are personally D\u2014 2"], [48, "36 DOCTOR, OR LOA'ER. objectionable, as I am sure this Troika must be.\" With all her heart Bertha wished it might have been so, but her father's inquiry simply engraved the knoAvledge that Karl Troika's departure would mean some spring of happiness removed from her life, and the concentrated thought of this man's opinion of her, and forgetfulness of her brother's slightest AA'him, caused Bertha to OAvn, that he, Avhom she had meant to despise, had become her beau ideal of manhood \u2014 had become a part of her interest in life, would henceforth have a part in her thoughts and actions ; and knoAving this, the girl sighed as her father left the morning-room. Bertha let her work drop, and bent forward, burying her face in her hands, which pressed close to those fair cheeks that had gone so far to betray the heart's secret, as noAvthe lips whispered it to the breeze, in the AArords : \" Mother ! my dear, loving mother, Avhy"], [49, "37 SECRET LOVE. cannot one be happy, be content in one's self ? \" A silence folloAved, and, as Avas to be guessed, Bertha, stirred by strong feeling, ansAvered her OAvn impetuous question. \" Life is not worth living without love, and yet here am I rebelling. What does it matter to this man Avhether I shall miss him or not . \" Seldom it is that Ave are ansAvered so positively as this girl thinker Avas ; but the very man who formed the object of those thoughts Avas Avalking leisurely doAAn the drive AA'ith Louis Lesley, and, seeing Bertha sitting at the open windoAV, decided to cross the laAvn and speak to her. So, turning to his companion, Karl said : \" There's your sister, I think AA'e'll turn across the grass and tell her about the run, shall Ave . \" Better keep it for luncheon time, and then the governor will hear at the same time.\" But as Troika turned off, Louis added, \" Well, go if you like, I'm off to see about my cob.\""], [50, "38 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? Noav, Bertha had caught the sound of voices, and had purposely withdrawn from the AvindoAv, Avhen Karl Troika's tall shadow Avas cast across the casement. \" Shall I be giving you cold if I stay here, Miss Lesley . Louis and I have had such a gallop Avith the hounds that I did not realize it Avas chilly till you gave that shiver.\" Bertha, who insensibly kneAv Karl Avas there, turned toAAards the window, and, evading his question, asked another. \" Did you see Lilie Marsh . Father told me she AA'as driving furiously, so as to see the hounds throAv off.\" \" Miss Marsh 1 No, I think not ; but Ave must ask Louis that,\" and Karl gave a melodious laugh, as he leant forAvard on the window sill. \" But I missed Rore and her mistress, and being my last run in these parts, I should have liked to carry aAA-ay a remembrance of the day and the companionship.\""], [51, "39 SECRET LOVE. \" Then you are leaving us ? I did not know that when we arranged our plans this morning. I suppose you are tired of Slade, already . \" In vain Bertha Lesley tried to speak in an indifferent tone, that after chord of regret would sound audibly to the acute ear. \" No ; the place itself has neither tired me nor otherAA'ise ; and if I had myself knoAA-n my plans, I should have asked you to spare me this morning's ride. Will you let me tell you why I am going . \" Karl Troika had taken possession of Bertha Lesley's hand, and, if ever a pair of handsome eyes looked pleading a cause con amore, his did. But this young man really simply recognised that a AA'oman above the average, both in intellect and looks, Avas Avithin his means of captivating, and he determined that to aAvaken the heart of such an one would be Avorth risking another invitation to Slade."], [52, "40 DOCTOR, OR LOVER . Bertha framed no positive reply to his request; but the hand still remained captive, and Karl continued : \" Well, then, I am going, because you are more to me than I dare to think of, and yet for even one small spark of liking on your part I would Avait \u2014 I Avould undergo any probation. But because I love you Bertha, I cannot trust myself; therefore I must go.\" \" Must you go . \" The Avords sounded senseless, but the tone and look told Karl that a bold stroke would Avin the day. One bound, and he stood in the room, and a passionate kiss Avas imprinted on her brow. \" Only for a time, and I would have spared you that had I believed my feeling of love AA\"as likely to be understood. But loving as I do, made me feel fearful of taking to heart any kindness from you.\" Then Bertha in a feAv simple words told hoAv she had meant to despise this friend of her"], [53, "SECRET LOVE. 41 brother's ; but how he had Avon her respect and she added : ' When I heard you were leaving us, I kneAV, Karl, that life would never be the same without you, And hoav, Karl, you say you love me! \u2014 and I have loved you almost from the first, it seems to me. The final words Avere so gently spoken, that it was Avell Karl Troika AA-as no half-hearted wooer in the way of encircling Bertha's Avaist with his arm, or he might have never heard them, for on the girl's part this love was too intensely in earnest to run a smooth course. \" Then my revolutionary ideas never made you misjudge me . Oh ! Bertha, I wish I could think your father AA'as as unprejudiced ; he Avill never think me worthy of his daughter.\" Entirely trusting in Karl Troika's honour, it AA'as an easy matter for Bertha to consent to their love for one another to remain a secret, both from Mr. Lesley and Louis, for the three months"], [54, "42 DOCTOR, OR LOVER . of Troika's absence, for he promised to ask the former's consent to the engagement the folloAA'ing Easter. \" And as for Louis,\" Karl explained, \" he need only be told that you are interested in my Avork for the social Avelfare of Liberals generally.\" \" And my letters may come direct to you, Karl . I could not Avait for Louis' whims in writing to you. It Avill be doubly hard for me keeping my love from father.\" Bertha's voice shook, for father and daughter had been all in all to one another for the last few years, but Karl Troika Avas ready Avith an ansAA'er that Avas theoretically perfect, yet equally unpractical. \" Then let me go to Mr. Lesley at once. I would not have waited one moment, Bertha, but you shared my doubts as to his consent being given.\" \" No, I could not bear him to refuse; it Avould mean leaving him in anger.\""], [55, "43 SECRET LOVE. \" Then, for your sake, there shall be no such cruel chance, I Avill gain your father's better opinion, and Avait until Ave are sure of his blessing.\" If Karl Troika had said his personalty, it AA'ould have been nearer the truth ; but so it Avas, that Bertha Lesley bound herself by a secret engagement to one, of whom the most she kneAv Avas that as an orphan of twelve years old. Karl Troika, left under the guardianship of a Pole then keeping a boys' school in the suburbs of London, and from the same school Karl Troika, by means of a Avell-earned scholarship entered the University of Cambridge. There tradition ended, and Bertha Avas supposed to have knoAvn this Anglo-Russian's history through Louis : hoAv, at tAventy-one, through some un explained influence, Karl had gained the appoint ment of an Under Secretaryship at the Russian Embassy in London ; also that Troika Avas a prominent member among the Freemasons, and"], [56, "44 DOCTOR, OR LOVER . had persuaded Louis Lesley to join them during the long A-acation which had been spent in town. This Avas then all that Bertha Lesley kneAv of the past of the man to Avhose keeping she had entrusted her love. But no shadow of mistrust darkened the parting on the morrow, when Karl snatched a last kiss, and AA'hispered the AATords : \" I go but to work for my Bertha ; to live on dreams of thee.\" Then he went into the hall to bid a formal adieu to the Rector, for it had been agreed betAA-een the lovers that Bertha should be spared the general leave taking, But the Rector as it happened had mislaid a book, and had come from his study to seek his daughter's help, so that young Troika's explanation as to having bid good-morning to Miss Lesley Avent for nothing, and, in response to her father's call, Bertha came forward. \" I have lost my Cicero, Bertha,\" the Rector ex plained, \"but AA-ait noAvuntil Mr. Troika has gone.\""], [57, "SECRET LOVE. 45 So father and daughter Avere left standing at the Rectory door together, Bertha outwardly indifferent to Karl Troika's final gaze, while a feeling of loneliness crept over her, only to be intensified by her father remarking : \" Well, good riddance to such Radical rubbish. What do you say, childie . \" \" That Louis' friends can ne\\erbe that to me, father.\" \" A good job this felloAv has that recom mendation in your eyes, for it Avas as much as I could do to put up Avith this Karl Troika about the place. No reply Avas made by Bertha, who simply went into the study, and found the missing Cicero, and then Avent to her OAvn room, oppressed by two feelings : a longing, unsatisfied love for the man her father despised, and a hard feeling of the injustice on that father's part, AA-hose every act till uoav had been perfect in the loving reverence of a childlike fidelity."], [58, "DOCTOR, OR LOA'ER . 46 CHAPTER V. SUPPRESSED FEVER. On Louis Lesley's return from seeing Karl Troika off for London, he announced the arrival of Colonel Gorten and his family at Slade. \" The furniture, I hear, came last week,\" con tinued Louis, \" and the hall is furbished up. There is one daughter, Bertha, but she has spine complaint they say, and is perfectly helpless.\" \" Yes, I kneAv that, but had no idea the Gortens \\\\Tere taking possession of the hall so soon as this ; it is altogether a mistake coming doAA'n here at this time of the year,\" added Mr. Leslev. And then he asked : \" Did you see any of the sons, Louis .\" \" Yes, three great Rugby cubs; look Avell"], [59, "SUPPRESSED FEVER. 47 enough in the cricket field, but at the station seemed doing their best to murder their sister by dropping her carrying chair.\" \" Do you know how old this daughter is, father . \" And Bertha turned to Mr. Lesley, adding : \" I have little doubt but that the parish oracles have supplied all the necessary information about these Gortens.\" \" Just SAA-eet seventeen, Bertha, and Miss Price told me \u2014 and she is your priestess of Didonia, I fancy,\" Avas the Rector's reply, and he laughed at Bertha's sharp guess that he Avould be so fully aAvare of the latest gossip. \" Onlv seventeen, poor girl ! Well, she will escape one misery, that of being pestered to take a district.\"' \" No doubt ; but Colonel Gorten can hardly be aAvare that scarlet feA-er is about doAArn here \u2014 to bring an invalid child Avhere it must be risky.\" \" Scarlet fever !\" exclaimed Louis, \" Why,"], [60, "48 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? father, I never knew it was in Slade, so a stranger stands very little chance of knowing about it. That's why the Marshes are speaking of leaving Court Leas for a time. But did you knoAv there Avas fever in the village, Bertha . \" Yes, it would have been more startling to me, Louis, to hear there AA-as not a single fever case in Slade, for it is always more or less among the poor here in the valley. Is it not, father .\" The Rector looked grave. He AA'as thinking out his duty in enlightening the neAv comer, but he answered his daughter's question with the words, \" Yes, fever of one kind or another. Its frequency engenders contempt, I fear, still the danger to a neAv inhabitant Avill intensify the ill. And so neither Louis, nor you, Bertha, must call at the Hall till I have seen Iioav matters are.\" The Rector Avas right. The Gortens had not been more than tAAro weeks at the Hall before the Colonel found out that several cases of scarlet fever existed in Slade, and being a man of action he"], [61, "49 SUPPRESSED FEVER. called at the Rectory, holding the orthodox opinion that a State Church makes its ministers responsible not only for the welfare of souls, but of sanitary bodies. Mr. Lesley had long ago tried to cure, or, at any rate, mitigate, the evil ; but, single-handed as he was, reform Avas impossible. And directly his visitor explained the object of his call, the Rector gave the true state of matters. \" The fever is nursed in the damp Avails and thatch of the cottages, and by most of the drains running close to the wells. I am like our old doctor here \u2014 so used to it that I never fear infection. There is literally no one of position or energy left to help me to cope with it, because Mr. Marsh, Avho owns Court Leas, always turns his back on Slade whenever the fever gets ahead of its usual chronic condition.\" \" Well, Avith your assistance,\" answered Colonel Gorten, \" I am more than willing to cope AAith this scourge. I have already been vol i. E"], [62, "DOCTOR, OR LOVER . 50 appointed on the magisterial bench, and we will call in legislative aid. It is not right that any man should sit contentedly down, even if his OAAm particular eyrie is above the stricken valley. I should not now be mourning my dear Avife if I had not sat supinely in my verandah at Agra when the cholera raged there.\" \" A terrible loss, as I myself know.\" And the Rector sighed heavily at the recollection of past days. Then he added : \" You Avill write to Whitehall then, and let me know AA'hat is decided . \" \" Certainly ; and, meanwhile, I shall see this Marsh, and get him to support any local measure we propose.\" \" I have little hope of his assistance, but Court Leas is not far from here, and a call would bring him round perhaps. Will you make my daughter's apologies to Miss Gorten for not calling at present. I thought it AAiser with this fever to Avait a time.\""], [63, "51 SUPPRESSED FEVER. '\u2022 Certainly, and thanks for such considera tion. You may have heard that my poor Grace is helpless from spine complaint,\" replied the Colonel ; and the Rector having expressed his sympathy, the visitor took his departure. In the afternoon, Bertha Lesley drove over to Court Leas, to find both Mrs. and Mr. Marsh in a panic caused by the Colonel's visit ; for, although the conjecture that scarlet fever Avas in Slade had been known for some Aveeks, still a bare statement of the fact had paralysed this characterless mother and daughter. Questions followed each other in hot haste as Bertha came into the drawing room. \" Hoav many fresh cases had broken out since Colonel Gorten came . \" This from the anxious mother. \" Had Bertha come to say good-bye before start ing for Europe . \" from Lilie Marsh ; and then : \" Was Colonel Gorten afraid that his invalid daughter had taken the fever . \" E\u2014 2"], [64, "DOCTOR, OR LOVER . 52 When duly assured by Bertha that none of these things were likely to take place, Mr. Marsh explained the Colonel's visit of that morning, and, in a pompous tone, gave his answer in extenso for Bertha's benefit. \" YTou know, I told him I Avas not going to stop in Slade to support any one's measures, but I said : ' You're Avelcome, Colonel, to draw a big cheque on my bankers if you'll wait till I and my Aviso and daughter are safely out of this fever stricken hole.\" \" And what did Colonel Gorten say . \" asked Bertha, looking at the millionaire, with just a shadow of a smile on her lips. \" Well, he seemed just taken aback ; but talked about unselfish regard for those poor around us, and never so much as asked for the cheque, though I told him I should not be here longer than Avas just necessary for the women to pack up.\" \" Y'es,\" interposed Lilie ; \" Ave are going to"], [65, "SUPPRESSED FEVER. 53 Brighton, and really I am so frightened that when I saAv you coming.

Lilie ain't frightened of Mr. Louis, are you, Lilie . \" broke in Mrs. Marsh, \" He does us such good Avith his jokes and bright spirits. I wish you'd both come and take rooms at Brighton.\" \" Then a on really intend to leave Slade ? For myself it would be foolish, because there is really no more fever in the place than usual,\" was Bertha's cool answer."], [66, "DOCTOR, OR LOVER . 54 \" Well, of course, we shall be glad to get braced up in any case. But here's Mr. Louis coming. Just go out and tell him his sister's here, there's a good child.\" And mamma Marsh turned to the \" Innocent,\" as Karl Troika styled her ; Avhile Bertha ground her teeth at the thought of Avhat a malleable tool Louis Avas in the Marshs' hands. When young Lesley entered the room, Mrs. Marsh continued: \"Just who Ave wanted. I have been trying to persuade your sister to come to Brighton. We are going there to-morroAv. What do you say, Mr. Louis . \" \" That it's a first-rate idea,\" was Louis's eager ansAver. \" You'll go, Bertha . \" and the speaker turned to his sister. \" Certainly not. If matters arc as serious as one might suppose by such a general exodus from Slade, I should not care to leave my father alone,\" Avas Bertha's quiet ansAver. \" Oh ! you are unkind, Bertha ; you might"], [67, "SUPPRESSED FEVER. 55 come,\" pleaded Lilie. But when it was proposed that if Louis would remain with their father, Bertha would see about coming to Brighton for a week, the question was left undecided, and Bertha left Court Leas convinced of one fact, and that was that it was Louis' company that was so- desirable, in-as-much that her brother had been persuaded into running doAvn to Brighton the end of that same Aveek it being Wednesday the afternoon of their visit. Saturday soon came, and Bertha drove her brother to the station. To the enquiry whether he intended to remain away till Slade Avas con sidered free from infection, Louis answered : \" I can't say yet when I shall return, for I intend running up to town, and then having a final sea breeze if our friends are still at Brighton.\" \"That means that you'll stay aAvay as long as your present allowance lasts. I only hope the"], [68, "56 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? Marshes Avon's find new friends pleasanter than old ones.

The end of another week brought a communi cation from Whitehall, and it ran as follows : \u2014 \" The cases of fever and the generally insanitary state of Slade and the neighbourhood, have received our earnest attention, and the Inspector for South Devon, Dr. Lee West, M.D., has received instructions to thoroughly look into sanitation in the district, and to remain on the spot until such time as he shall deem all measures tending to the general health carried out. It is trusted that all the assistance possible will be given to the above appointed official in your poAA'er.\" This letter, addressed to Colonel Gorten, A\\-as"], [72, "DOCTOR, OR LOVER . 60 brought by him to the Rectory, and also the information, that at Doctor West's request, the Colonel had bespoken the only apartments in Slade \u2014 those of a Airs.

This widow, without the incumbrance of a heavy balance at the bank, but with a small villa-house, left to her by the late lamented Price, let tAvo rooms, by way of realizing some ready money, and, up to recently, these had been occupied by the Curate, who, for the time being, worked under Air.

But, Avhen his reverence, Ebenezer Reel, appeared on the scenes, he chose humbler quarters, Avhere, no doubt, his heart, if not his purse aaus safer, as daughters were not among the advantages offered in his present lodgings.

His father had died in harness, leaving a first rate practice, but no means AA'hereAvith to keep it together. Mr. West, senior, Avas content to live up to his income, the truth being, that the amount of that income had for some years been an unstated quantity. At the time of his father's death, Lee was seventeen ; too young to slip into his father's shoes, and yet the education of tAvo sisters prevented his mother from substituting a locum tenens."], [74, "62 DOCTOR, OR LOVER? So the practice Avas sold, and mother and daughters retired to Newport, where the youngest \u2014 Matilda \u2014 was still at school, for Lee West came between the two girls, a veritable rose between tAvo thorns, as all who knew the home circle would attest. Emily West Avas lost to all the practical aims of life \u2014 an enthusiastic disciple of Spiritualism \u2014 and existing in a state of highly wrought nervousness, and on all sides meeting with mesmeric non-conductors and mediums among her circle of friends. When Lee West had walked his duly allotted number of hospitals, he returned to Newport, and was in the nick of time to take up a country partnership with a Doctor White, of Roncheme; and, to further lighten his mother's hands, Emily West was to settle with her brother, and keep house for him in the main street of this small watering place. It was not long before the young Doctor, on"], [75, "63 THE YOUNG .Al.D. his rounds, heard rumours of his sister's spirit rapping tendencies, couched in the following remarks : \" Oh !

And being a great reader, it did not trouble him to know that invitations were less frequent than at first ; and, of course, if his sister chose to make her eccentricities so marked she must abide by the consequences in being shunned, and, therefore, rather dull. Matters remained in this state till Lee West"], [76, "64 DOCTOR, OR LOVER 1 had been a year at Roncheme, when a young lady, a Miss Melville, came to this out-of-the-Avay seaside village as a patient of Bis partner. Dr. White. She Avas recovering from a nen-ous fever, and had come down from London, with a French nurse, to regain strength in the quiet, fresh air of Roncheme. Noav, at his partner's desire, Lee had asked Emily to see as much of the invalid as possible ; but, at the same time, Avarned her not to speak on her favourite subject until such time as he gave her permission. Dr. White took more than an ordinary interest in the case, as Mr. Melville Avas a school felloAv, and he Avas thoroughly acquainted with the ins and outs of the case, AA-hich he communicated to AYest as folloAvs : Miss Melville had been engaged to a French officer, Avhen she, in all innocence repeated some remark about a gambling debt oAved by her oaati brother Pierre, to another army officer, and that so enraged young Melville that he called Rene"], [77, "65 THE YOUNG M.D. out, and a bullet from that officer's pistol left Pierre Melville dead on the turf. From that moment Amy Melville lost both a brother and lover, for Rene disappeared, and melancholia with all its attendant miseries set in, which Paris AA'ith all its physicians and all its honeyed attractions failed to cure. But London, where Mr. Melville settled, brought matters to a climax, and brain fever Avas the effort of nature through which it Avas fondly hoped Amy Melville Avould be restored to life and reason. As Avas mentioned, Lee West kneAv the cause, and, therefore, when asking his sister to show Amy Melville every kindness, entreated her to abstain from Avorking on the imagination of a still Aveak brain poAver. So favourably had the case gone on that Emily often joined the invalid for a stroll on the sands, and got quite accus tomed to her companions acute sensibility and timidity, and at last looked on Lee's Avaming as a, foolish veto ; so that one afternoon when Amy VOL.

Melville asked her friend to remain for a chat in the lodgings instead of returning home, what more natural, than that Emily should hold forth on her pet hobby \u2014 spirit influence. Soon Amy Melville got deeply interested, and the conver sation approached that captivating but dangerous speculation \u2014 the condition of the departed. The invalid recalled the tragic past, and asked : \" Is it possible to recall a soul from the other world to ask for then forgiveness .\" \" Yres, possible ; and quite right to ask such a boon,\" Avas Emily West's emphatic reply. \" Would the spirit understand an explana tion . And, if forgiveness AA'as AA-ithheld, did that mean eternal hate . \" Amy Melville entreated to know, and the spiritualistic friend continued to explain : \" Yres.

It Avas close upon the stroke of seven that same evening when the surgery bell at Doctor West's was violently rung, and, not waiting for a message to be brought, the French bonne, with her large frilled cap set rakishly on one side of her head, rushed into where Dr. West and his sister were sitting, and exclaimed : \" Ah ! mon JJieu ! the English lady has killed ma petite sainte ! Make for your life to run docteur and snatch her from the demons !

When Lee reached Miss Melville's lodgings he found his partner already there ; the patient was in a state of delirium, calling frequently on her brother, But even had the spirit of the departed one been alloAA'ed, in God's infinite mercy, to return an ansAver to the girl's prayer, the brain could not have realized it ; all the tenour of the mind was snapped asunder, and both doctors knew that then science availed nought at this crisis. But Lee West felt his helplessness keenly on account of his sister's part in the break down of all their hopes for Amy Melville's cure.

When the day's Avork Avas over, and after an hour's imperative rest, Lee West approached the subject of all his trouble by informing his sister that Dr. White had discussed the subject, and had for some time doubted the wisdom of his sister's antipathic influence among the patients ; and, of course, after what had occurred he (Dr. White) should not feel justified in receiA'ing an invalid with the risk of so fatal a termination as in Miss Melville's case was ahA'ays possible.

It Avould hardly be safe, with the fever so bad as it still is.\" \" Oh ! Bertha. It makes no difference with her, she is often in and out among your poorer patients. It is my son Louis Avho is such a coward about it ; but my daughter, like myself, does not believe in your scientific code of un-ordained ills.\" And the Rector laughed pleasantly, as he told .a servant to sIioav Dr. AYest up stairs, and to point out the draAA'ing-room door. AA'hen he came down, the door stood ajar, and Lee could hear some familiar refrain being played on the piano.

His latch-key had scarcely turned in the door before the tout ensemble of Prices confri mted Lee, eager to know what had caused such a punctual man not to \" come home to tea.\" Aliss Price, as clericus petticoatus principia began : \" Oh !

Though March carried away the damp, and in that Avay, the fever, still the Alarshes remained absent from Court Leas. But Bertha had heard through Karl Troika that Louis had left Brighten for good, and Avas now in London. The fact that no fresh cases of fever had broken out in Slade for the last fortnight Avas communicated to Louis Lesley, but it AA'as not until a month later that the real cause of Louis' exodus from Brighton came to his sister's knoAvledge. It happened in this Avise. A certain officer in the 12th Hussars Avas struck AA'ith a happy thought, that even lost Aitches can be plugged in by gold, and that Lilie Alarsh AA'as herself by no means bad form. It Avas soon apparent to Louis, that this dashing Hussar Avas"], [98, "86 DOCTOR, OR LOVER . paying marked attention to Aliss Marsh, and that he himself AA'as at a discount. \" You see,\" said mamma, \"he looks so fine harm in harm with my Lilie, and then he's somehoAv connected with the 'Ouse of Alarl borough.\" \" Y'es, on the hanging committee, I should hope,\" Avas Louis Lesley's savage reply, as he turned from Airs. Alarsh to saunter alone on the sands. It AA'as so much vinegar to Louis, Avho, to give him his due, cared for Lilie Alarsh for herself, not for her fortune. But thus it Avas : this young man Avas suspected by the parents of being a fortune hunter, Avhile the officer, barely liAing on his pay, but making great outAAard pretension, was encouraged in his suit.

But it Avas not until the return of the Alarshes, with theh future son-in-law in attendance, that Bertha Lesley saAv through her brother's recent conduct. For Karl Troika had forwarded a rambling letter from Louis, asking his sister to send him money to meet some pressing bills, Karl Troika's comment on the same, running thus : \" Your brother has given me his confidence, and asks me to second his request for some money.

The features of all present bore the characteristic stamp of the Caucasian type, and their dress would enable one to classify them as belonging to the working class, or bourgeois. Karl Troika Avas asking a question : \" Then three of you have your leave extend ing to the end of April, and then must return to your own province . \" The ansAver AA'as in the affirmative, and the alternative loss of the small plot to the State and wife and family driven forth as vagrants. \" One rule that has no exception, my friends,\" said Karl, in a decided voice. \" AA'ell this is the twenty-fifth of AIarch,and youhave heard m v offer.

If Avell, I Avill ask that the Avoids of the St. Petersburg JNoro, of last Aveek, be read.\" And AA'ith this suggestion, the speaker dreAA from his pocket an edition of that paper, and passed it to Troika, who read aloud this para graph : \" The policy of Russia is superb.

I am here for the reward when the work is done.\" \" Right !\" The young Anglo-Russian rose from his chair and unrolled a parchment, which each man signed with a name or a cross, silently and gravely ; and then one after the other took their departure, with the exception of the man who produced the St. Petersburg paper.

And iioav avc must leave these secret circles, and let the 25th day of the month reveal the plot round AA'hich so much of their hopes and thoughts centred. AYhile the clays had been fraught with such deep import to Karl Troika's future, Bertha"], [125, "113 CONSPIRACY. Lesley's existence had been peaceful and uneventful. The love-letter, written each alter nate night, Avas posted from the neighbouring hamlet of Rungley, secret love having taught the watchfulness of Briareus and his numerous eyes. And in Slade the letters had to be placed in an open box at the Rectory door ; and what should prevent Air. Lesley from noticing his daughter's sudden mania for letter-AA'riting . So Bertha Lesley's walks Avere so arranged that either in going or coming they touched on Rungley, and thus the village gossips lost a fund of expectant speculation so dear to then county hearts. The fever had run its course in Slade, and yet Dr. Lee AA'est remained. He no longer occupied the rooms at Airs. Price's, but had taken a small cottage residence about a quarter of a mile from the main A'illage street, and had a Cornish woman as working-housekeeper. Sunday seemed always an off day with the AOL.

Doctor, for, of course, during the week he had to spend three or four clays in a distant part of the County ; but the last train on Saturday invariably brought AA'est back to Slade, and the following morning he as regularly appeared in church. And yet at Newport Airs. AYest and his two sisters wondered where Slade Avas, for even the excellent map Aland had used at the high school had no such place marked ; and none of their friends, Avell up in South Devon, had any knoAvledge of Slade, so it must, indeed, be an out-of-the-Avorld spot. AYhen week after Aveek went by and Lee's address remained stationary, Emily AYest had exclaimed : \" It is so like Lee, to bury himself alive ; otherwise, if he must give up a private practice, why not have made Newport his headquarters instead of this pokey little Slade . \" \" Y'ou forget he is under Government, and must be somewhere in Devonshire for his"], [127, "115 CONSPIRACY'. work, Emily ; besides, I always think Lee likes the country,\" AAas the younger sister Aland's reply. \" AYell, I only hope he may find this place an agreeable desert, for I'm sure neither of us will care to trouble him with our company.\" Alaud Avas amused at her sister's speech, as she ansAvered : \" No ; I should not Avonder if that decided Lee in settling there.\" And the comersation having got upon dangerous ground, the peacemaker \u2014 the AvidoAved mother \u2014 turned then thoughts to other subjects. But it AAas not Avonderful that at home Lee's conduct caused them some surprise, for he him self had never taken Slade into consideration when he first came, although the station AA'as only the first on a branch line in communication Avith the Great AYestern service. At the end of that Aveek, Avhen we saAv old Dr. Moore offering to give up part of his practice, Lee's decision to 1\u20142"], [128, "116 DOCTOR, OR LOVER . remain at Slade had been made ; and, in after years, Lee AVest tried to solve the riddle of which part of that evening had most weighed AA'ith him in fixing on his former home. But itAA'as many and many a day before it was answered. Sunday, and noAV and again a quiet smoke at Dr. Aloore's, brought Lee and the Rector together ; but when all the needful improve ments had been carried out, Air. Lesley and his model, as Bertha laughingly styled the young doctor, did not see much of one another. Colonel Gorten had invited him to the Hall directly the Alarshes returned to Court Leas, and had assured him fear of infection AA'as over. The friendship grew ; for, besides the Colonel and his horse-loving sons, the kind, thoughtful face AA'as looked for by Grace Gorten, as she lay hour by hour through the day on her sofa, hoping that Dr. AA^est had not been sent for, as he AA'as sure to come in AA'ith her father, or, later on, with one of her brothers."], [129, "CONSPIRACY. 117 .And yet Lee himself never seemed to shirk any call, however trivial, except on Sunday eAening, and then if any one detained him he would become impatient, and plead a standing invitation from the Rector as an excuse for haste ; and yet on these occasions the Curate invariably came in after service, and as invariably engrossed all Bertha Lesley's attention by arrangements for the next Sunday ; Avhilc Lee A\\ est, except for Air. Lesley's remarks and kindness, seemed left completely out in the cold. Each Sunday, Lee would Avish that the Curate might share the fate of any ass but Balaam's. Y'et he would never forego this supper, even AA'hen Colonel Gorten kept his brougham waiting after sen-ice to take him back to the Hall. Was Bertha Lesley the magnetic pole . If so, the Doctor himself scarcely realised it, and, certainly, the points AA'ere non-conductive ones so far as she Avas concerned."], [130, "118 DOCTOR, OR LOVER. CHAPTER X. THE PLOT WORKS. The daily papers of April 26th, under their heading of foreign news, had the startling information : \" The St. Petersburg Xoro, of last evening startled the civilized world with the news that the Russian Aral Fleet Avas threatened AA'ith entire destruction, Avhile entering the harbour at Neulaif. Just as the Fleet Avas coming to its anchorage, a frigate, under the command of Novaliski, hoisted its signal to bespeak the flag-ship ; and, after a short interview AA'ith the Admiral of the Fleet, it Avas noticed the Avhole fleet stood out to sea again and anchored off Serpent Island. It is stated that, from secret"], [131, "119 THE PLOT AVORKS. information, Count Novaliski discovered a plot by which the fleet as it passed into Neulaif AA'as to be blown up by means of a sub-marine mine, and within the course of a few hours a torpedo boat. With hands on board, Avas taken red-handed, close to the spot where the fleet would have cast anchor. Another Nihilists' plot aimed at the life of the Czar, as it Avas expected he would be on board, and land at Neulaif, eu route from Aden.\" This paragraph conveys to us the history of Karl Troika's conspiracy ; and yet so little did Bertha Lesley dream of her lover's part in an event that shook the confidence of the whole of Europe, 'that in her next letter to Karl Troika, she remarked : \" Have you seen how the Russian fleet Avas endangered, and at the last moment, by God's mercy, the whole plot AAas exposed, and the originators, or rather their tools, met with a just retribution . I, as you know, long for the"], [132, "120 EOCTOR, OR LOVER. freedom of Russia, but not through wholesale slaughter.\" When Karl Troika read this, he Avas on his way from the Lyceum. Now the Russian Ambassador in London had also been to see Irving and Aliss Terry, and Karl Troika, the third Secretary at the Embassy, Avas remarkably anxious to secure a good place at the same theatre on this night of the 25th of April. In this he showed the wisdom of not being over confident, for he knew, that should the plot of the torpedo explosion miscarry, his unconcerned behaviour on that special evening, would count in his favour afterwards. And again on the following evenings Karl sat directly facing the box used by those from Chesham House. And iioaa he Avas reading Bertha's letter in a hansom on his way home ; and chuckling to himself, murmured : \" AYcll, if only this just retribution will fall speedily and get those chaps out of the Avav, I"], [133, "121 THE PLOT WORKS. shall be equally thankful to any man \u2014 or God \u2014 who achieves it.\" On reaching Soho Square, Karl Troika found a Concise note awaiting him. \" The words spoken at Cracow have been bravely remembered. Six, proud to call them selves Poles, are now on their AA'ay to Siberia ; and we ourselves are, as our countryman said, willing to leave to our posterity\u2014 -happier, perhaps, than ourselves \u2014 those means of saving our dear country, whereof we are bereft at present. Forced by circumstances to accept these, the only means of release, avc accept them. This is the message to our circle ; we trust it may cement the gap.\" This then Avas the cypher. No number of any kind Avas on the paper, so, that even had it wafted toAvarcls Scotland Yard, the finder would have been no Avit the AA'iser. But to Troika it was as plain as daylight in June. The six men Avhom we saw at the secret"], [134, "122 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ! meeting in Soho Square, had been sacrificed by those who knew that no erratic explosion, no assasination of the Czar, would place power and liberty in their hands, until the pillars sup porting that despotism, protecting that autocrat, Avere removed by cunning ; and, therefore, their one aim was to get their ablest patrio ts \u2014 their Polish nobles\u2014 round the Czar's person, to all outward appearance Russians, but waiting patiently until such time, as surrounded by a poAA'erful circle of traitors, the tyrant would call in vain on his Generals and the Officers of his fleet, for they AA'ould be the first to turn his own strength against him. Thus it Avas that Count Novaliski, fully cognisant of the torpedo plot, went out in a frigate to foreAA-arn the Admiral of the Russian Fleet of the hidden danger, and most certain doom awaiting them. By standing out to sea, safety was insured ; and then, in the dead of the night, the torpedo boat Avas AA'atched for and"], [135, "123 THE PLOT WORKS. surrounded by three ships of the line, and the six conspirators ordered to surrender or be shot down. Then they AA'ere taken on board the flag ship under a strong guard, and without trial banished to Kerson, whence they were finally drafted to the wilds of Siberia. Not one word of guilty or not guilty. While Count Novaliski, the providential means of saving the fleet \u2014 how Avas he treated . Why, sent to St. Petersburg and created Naval Attache, no reasons for his remarkable perspicuity being required here, the capital AA'as so honeycombed by con spiracy, AA'hile the Nihilists were so constantly laying themselves open to suspicion by the very caution and mystery in their movements. And the last place to be suspected Avas the Polish quarter in London, and Karl Troika still gathered round him those patriots of various nationalities and AA'as well content with his share in Count Novaliski's promotion as one step in the circle of revenge to come."], [136, "124 DOCTOR, OR LOVER. Time ran its rapid course, and it Avas noAV close upon Easter, and Bertha Lesley made a sugges tion in one of her letters that Louis should return home and Karl come to Slade again. Now, although wishing to avoid awkward questions on the head of Bertha Lesley's with drawn capital, still Horace's \" otum cum dignitate \" was too great a temptation, and Louis' reply was : \" AYell, I'm ready to go, and, perhaps, it Avill be less harrowing to be short of funds in that hole of a place, Slade, than up here.\" So Karl's next letter to Bertha told her to expect them that day AA'eek, which communica tion made Bertha feel very happy ; and she informed her father of it under the guise of a letter from Louis. \" Father, Louis is coining home next AYednesday, and is bringing Mr. Troika AAith him. I expect he thinks Slade would be too dull if he had no one of his own class to go about with.\""], [137, "125 THE PLOT WORKS. \" Indeed ! And that conceited wrong-headed Chartist is the only friend he has, I suppose. AYell, I care little Avhat Louis does, if he is only contented, and keeps Avithin his alloAA'ance. The truth is Bertha, Louis thinks of no one but himself, and will bring you many a grey hair before your time.\" \" And if he does, father, remember he is my only brother to care for,\" Avas Bertha's sisterly reply. \" AYell, like your dear mother, child, your brother's conduct ahvays finds some excuse ; but Louis should settle doAvn to a country clergy man's occupations, instead of flirting first with that pretty doll, Lilie Alarsh, and then Avasting time and money in London Avith an Atheist as his boon companion.\" \" Don't, father ; you and Louis will never understand one another. I shall ahvays, I trust, remember dear mother's charge to me.\" And Bertha's voice trembled, moved to tears"], [138, "126 DOCTOR, OR LOVER\"? by many thoughts ; for surely hers Avas a hard path \u2014 the thorny side laid falloAv, and the seed sown by her own hand, and yet thorns and briars springing all around it. But Bertha Lesley AA'as so constituted that having once chosen her path, though the other side were soft Avith cotton doAA'n, she would never deviate from the sharp pricks of the side she had started to tread. How eagerly Bertha looked forward to the Wednesday of the folloAving Aveek her throbbing heart alone kneAv ; and when the time came and she drove over to the station in the phaeton, it required all a firm mind's training to prevent the secret love existing betAveen Karl Troika and herself being betrayed. Karl him self loooked paler than on his previous visit, but, except for a warm clasp of Bertha Lesley's hand, seemed outwardly very calm. It Avas a curious position, for Louis kneAv nothing of their engagement, but the former's loA'e of slinking all trouble fitted in Avith a little plan of Troika's,"], [139, "127 THE PLOT WORKS. who suggested when they got near the Rectory plantation that they should take the short cut to the house. At this Louis demurred, but Karl was not to be frustrated. \" Perhaps Aliss Lesley would like the walk 1 and you could drive the phaeton on.\" This quite fell in with Louis' jouruey-Avearied spirit, and he dropped Karl and his sister out side the drive. Not many minutes, and the lovers Avere alone, and Bertha felt that for all the long Availing, all the tangled AA'eb of deceit, the love of the man at her side would be a full recompense ; for Karl Troika AA'as no luke warm lover, as he AA'as no shalloAv conspirator, proof of which Ave knoAv. And winding his arm round Bertha, he kissed her, as he mur mured : \" AA'as it long waiting, dear . AYell, noAV I have come, you shall knoAv Iioav I Ioac you, Bertha.\" And as they lingered along Bertha ansAvered, \" I am happy, fully happy, to Avait ; but, Karl, it"], [140, "128 DOCTOR, OR LOVER ? is hard to seem ashamed of you, and I am forced to be dumb in your defence.\" \" Then your father dislikes me as much as eA'er . \" AAas Troika's quick reply. \" AYell, I will stake all if you like, but it Avill break up our truce of peace.\" \" No ; I love you too Avell to risk anything, Karl ; let us be as Ave are till there is a chance of my father's consent.\" And so they talked, Bertha being the one to hasten their steps. But true love is ever vigilant, and Karl had put forth the plea of mercy as touching his OAvn comfort, and so it Avas all potent Avith that girlish, guileless heart that to a certain extent she should curb her love for Karl's sake, little dreaming that in this care for her loAer's sake alone lay her own safeguard. The Rector Avas coolly civil to Troika Avhen they met at dinner, but many a stolen hour Avas spent by the lovers, oAving to his indifference to his guest ; and yet the father, in his oaati blind"], [141, "129 THE PLOT WORKS. dislike, never suspected Bertha of taking more pleasure in the company of this Karl Troika than in that of Air. Reel, the curate. And Louis, aaIio knew his friend spent heaps of time AA'ith his sister, did not care to open his father's eyes, for disappointment in his oaati fancied love for Lilie Alarsh had made him sarcastic and indifferent on the subject; and when he was in an ill humour, and sitting in the smoking-room with Karl, he would comment on love and marriage in the fol lowing bitter strain : \" Well, if a fellow's fool enough to get engaged, let him go to the dogs, for me ; he's good for nothing else afterwards. So I'd AA'arn you to take care, old fellow.\" And certainly the speaker's future was a mournful realization of his doctrine. VOL. I. K"], [142, "130 DOCTOR, OK LOVER . CHAPTER XI. THROWN TO THE GROUND. The society of such a place as Slade Avas necessarily of two kinds : the stately periodical call and invitation to a large dinner party, and the social tea drinking of the old maids, such as Airs. Price's charming daughters. Now, during Airs. Lesley's life-time, the Rector and herself took part in both these grades of entertainment, and if Louis had cared for friends, he could have made Slade quite a gay place ; but directly he found Colonel Gorten's sons cared more for out-door sports than idly smoking and betting, he declared them \" regular cubs,\" adding, \" The only good point about them is their knowledge of a good horse ; but Avho Avants"], [143, "131 THROWN TO Till: GROUND that continually . For my part I'd rather pay a ' vet.' once for all than be constantly bothered.\" Then with regard to Lee AYest, who the Rector AAas ahvays pleased to see, Louis declared : \" AYest was all very well, but AA'ho cared to knoAv such an admirable Crichton . \u2014 certainly not he.\" So Karl Troika stood little chance of seeing a stranger ; and, if he had not had an end in view, would not have cared. But Karl AAas anxious to start a Alasonic Lodge doAvn in those parts, and though AA'illing to see Louis Lesley his OAvn con- Aert in an official post, still AA'as conA'inced he AA-ould not do as Aiaster, even if his age had per mitted. Now the tAvo most desirable converts to make seemed to Karl Troika to be Dr. AYest and Colonel Gorten's eldest son; and, with this object in view, Karl expressed to Bertha his surprise that no tennis had begun.

Bertha Lesley enjoyed her role of hostess as she Avelcomed many as yet only known to her by name ; she Avas dressed in a pale blue material, slashed with cream silk ; and, in spite of the general penchant for tight skirts, Bertha, by having her dress made in toAA'n, had managed so that the robing fell to her figure like the beau ideal of the Greek school. A filigree necklace, the gift of her lover, encircled her neck, while two cream Alareschal Neils \u2014 one in the front of her dress, and one in her hah \u2014 gave the finishing touch to a graceful and artistic costume. The roses had come from the Hall, for Grace Gorten, though unable to take part in the gaieties, had persuaded her father and tAvo of her brothers to accept the Lesleys' invitation, leaving Frank behind to be AA'ith her, he being still a minor, as one more term at Harrow as yet hardly qualified him for a grown up young man. Dancing began at a quarter to ten, and Bertha gave the first AA'altz to Karl, who, ever"], [146, "DOCTOR, or lover ? 134 vigilant, had suggested that they should only dance four of the list together, adding, as he did so : \" It Avould not do for your father to see you giving me dances to the exclusion of strangers.

Now, Lee West, who had looked forAvard to this evening, had hoped to gain the first waltz from Bertha Lesley ; but, although the first to ask for that privilege, he found Karl Troika's name already inserted. At once his calm, and almost indifferent manner seemed stirred to anger against the stranger staying at the Rectory, and, rejoining Air. Lesley at the side of the marquee, Lee watched with jealous eyes young Troika's appropriation of Bertha as they whirled round in perfect symmetry of step.

And Lee heard no more, but he felt vexed and indignant at this Karl Troika prying into Bertha Lesley's concerns ; and a Aliss Jones, his partner in the square dance, thought a bear would have been as agreeable a dancer as the young man beside her.

On seeing Louis come up, his sister exclaimed : \" Don't dismount \u2014 ride home for Dr. Aloore, and, if he is out, anyone ! Go quickly ! I will stay here.\" \"All right.\" And Louis, who hated scenes, gladly spurred his steed towards Slade, to return, as it seemed to Bertha, after a thousand years, with Dr. Aloore and two men Avith an improA ised"], [185, "\" AVE ARE ENGAGED.\" 173 stretcher. Bertha, as she knelt AA'atching beside the injured man, looked quite as white as Karl, but AA'as quite calm in helping the doctor in restoring free respiration, and in the removal of some of the soaked garments and boots. After a cursory examination, Dr. Aloore assured them that Air. Troika AAas in no Aviso hopelessly injured. A concussion of some part of the spinal cord Avas the most serious hurt, and the left ankle Avas put out of joint. After seeing the patient lifted into a cart that had come along the road, and had been enlisted for the pur pose, Bertha Lesley allowed her brother to drive her back to Slade in Dr. Aloore's gig \u2014 the latter accompanying Karl, to see the jolting Avas made easier to the injured man. On reaching the Rectory, they found Air.

I trust the injury to the spiue may be not so severe as the insensibility made me fear.\" \" Y'ou said it AA'as the nape of the neck Avhere the injury AA7as, I think ? \" enquired the Rector, \" and, if so, lock jaw is possible, I suppose V"], [187, "\" AVE ARE ENGAGED.\" 175 \" Quite so, and then Ave are powerless, I fear.\" Bertha caught the Doctor's reply as she crossed to the sick room, and those Avoids \u2014 \" then we are powerless, I fear \" \u2014 struck a chill to her heart; but in a moment the resolve not to leave her lover's side until that fear AA'as past took possession of her, and she installed herself in the A'isitor's room, with the old housekeeper from Dr. Aloore's. It must have been close upon eleven AA'hen Louis came up to the sick room AA'ith a message from his father. He (the Rector) Avas going to bed, and Avished to knoAv Avhether the gardener should stop, or whether, as Louis was to sit up till tAvo a.m., Bertha thought no one would be required. To avoid any chance of Karl being in a semi-conscious state, Bertha had gone out on the landing to talk to her brother. She replied : \" AYhy, send Crick home.

Lesley Avas quite content to let the gardener be dismissed, and to hear that Louis Avas undertaking to sit up till two o'clock, never dreaming that Bertha Avas to be his companion. So matters settled quietly down, and it only wanted half an hour to the termination of Louis' watch, AA'hen the old housekeeper Avould take his place. Bertha had gone to give the patient some medicine, seeing he Avas not asleep. But her hand trembled so that Louis took the glass and held it to Karl's lips, AA'hen"], [189, "\"WE ARE ENGAGED.\" 177 he found the latter' s teeth firmly locked, aud, pressing the rim of the glass against them, found it impossible to get a drop of the liquid through. In a second Bertha realized that lock-jaw had set in, and she turned peremptorily to her brother : \" Go for Dr. AYest, at once, Louis ! \u2014 the villa cottage next the schools ; not Dr. Aloore \u2014 he's of no use.

Taking one of Karl's hands in hers, Bertha stood AA'aiting, fully, terribly conscious of her poAverlessness. And thus her father and Lee AYest found her ; but the doctor AA'as so keenly interested in his professional skill that he forgot to notice the surroundings.
