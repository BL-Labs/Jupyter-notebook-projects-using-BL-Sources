On leaving Lady Marston, Sir Hubert, after directing his servant to take all that he required to an hotel, jumped into a cab and drove straight to Digby 's house at Kensington. To his great vexation he found no one at home, but as the servant told him that master and missis had only gone to the Gardens to hear the band, he determined to wait for them. In about an hour they returned. Lucy was the first up-staifs. VOL. III. 1"], [10, "2 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Sir Hubert ! \" she exclaimed. \" Of course you are come to dinner. Why did not you bring Susan with you ? \" \" Good God ! Marston,\" said Digby, enter ing the room, and struck by the wildness of his friend's looks, \"what is the matter? \" \" Nothing ; at least nothing that I will be questioned upon,\" replied Sir Hubert, in a determined, not to say a fierce, tone of voice. \" Lady Marston and I have separated for ever, and I have come to you to settle the terms.\" \" Separated ! You and Susan separated ! \" said Mrs Digby, sinking into a chair. \" And where is she now ? \" \" In her own house, doubtless, where I left her an hour ago.\" \" John, stop the carriage. I will go to her at once. Oh, Sir Hubert, how could you have the heart ! \" \" One minute, Lucy,\" said Digby. \" I must know something more of this, before I allow you to go to a wife, from whom her husband finds it necessary to separate.\" \" Not a word against her, Digby,\" exclaimed Sir Hubert. \" The cause of our separation"], [11, "3 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. lies between her and me. Let Mrs Digby go to her, for she sorely needs a friend, and she has done nothing to forfeit your respect or her cousin's affection.\" \" I only hope you will be able to say as much for yourself, Sir Hubert,\" said Lucy, sharply, as she left the room to hurry up to London. During her absence, Marston informed Dig by of the arrangements he proposed to make. Digby thought them extravagant, and said so. \" I did not come to you for advice,\" said Marston ; \"I did not even come to you as to a friend. I came to you as to my solicitor, to draw up a deed in accordance with my in structions, and I hope to see it completed and executed to-morrow.\" Digby saw that the moment was not pro pitious for further observations, and began noting down the various heads of the deed of separation from Marston's dictation. While they were thus employed, Lucy returned in a state of the most violent excitement. \" She is gone ! \" she exclaimed. \" She has left your house with nothing but a few things."], [12, "4 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. There is a letter she left for you. If she comes; to harm, I will bear witness against you as her murderer.\" Marston rose to receive the letter, but fell back into his chair as if he had been shot. For a minute his hands trembled so that he could not break the seal, and a film seemed to come over his eyes. When he had succeeded in reading it, he put it into Digby's hands without saying a word. \" Thank God, it is no worse,\" said Digby, returning the letter, which his wife had read over his shoulder. \" She has left your house certainly, and I should say, with no immediate intention of returning. But she cannot be gone far \u25a0 probably into lodgings ; and there will be no difficulty in tracing her.\" Marston rose. \" What are you going to do now ? \" asked his friend. \" Do you think I could rest without know ing what has become of her ? \" \" I will go with you,\" said Digby. \" Do not wait dinner for me, Lucy; I may be late.\"' Lucy sat sobbing in a chair."], [13, "5 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \"You hate me now, Mrs Digby,\" said Sir Hubert, taking her hand, \" and I love you the better for it.\" As may be supposed, all their efforts were in vain. After Marston had made every enquiry at his own house, they drove to Scotland Yard, and for the next eight-and-forty hours a score of policemen of every class were employed in investigating Lady Marston's disappearance, without success. They contrived to ferret out the cabman who had driven her to London Bridge, but unfortunately he had forgotten to which particular office he had taken her, and the consequence was that emissaries were de spatched to Ramsgate, Margate, Dover, Folk stone, and even to Boulogne ; in short, in every direction but the right one. During the whole of this time Marston thought not of rest. He passed the day and night in wander ing backwards and forwards between his hotel and Scotland Yard, his own house and Digby's chambers. His affliction too was greatly ag gravated by the somewhat sudden death of a very dear friend. Fortunately, Digby, who had a very exten-"], [14, "6 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. sive acquaintance with the gentlemen of the press, was able to keep the affair out of the public papers. The servants were informed that Lady Marston had been suddenly sum moned to visit a sick friend in the country, of which they believed as much, or as little, as they pleased. As, however, they were really attached to their master and mistress, they contented themselves with discussing the sub ject amongst themselves, and with exemplary fidelity told all visitors, that Lady Marston had gone out of town for a few days, but where, they did not know. Amongst others to whom this piece of in formation was communicated was our friend Mr Penrhys, who, faithful to his self-made ap pointment, knocked at Lady Marston's door a few hours after her departure. Notwithstand ing a very skilful cross-examination of the butler, he was obliged to retire completely baffled, cursing the vagaries and caprices of women. On the morning of the second day since Lady Marston's disappearance, Digby was wending his way, in a very pensive and dis-"], [15, "7 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. consolate mood, towards the hotel where Sir Hubert had established himself. Not a trace had any one been able to discover of the fugi tive, and he was beginning to give way to the most gloomy* conjectures as to her fate. Turning a corner, he nearly ran into the arms of a man coming rapidly in the opposite direction. \"Mr Digby !\" exclaimed the new comer, ex tending his hand. \" The very man I wanted to see.\" \"Dr Crossby!\" exclaimed Digby, in his turn. \" I beg your pardon, Mr Dean ; per mit me to congratulate you on your new dignity. Can I be of any service to you ? \" Dr Crossby, or, as he was now to be called, the Dean of Newport, had been a tutor at Oxford while Digby was pursuing his studies at that university, and they knew each other well. \" Thank you,\" replied the Dean. \" I be lieve you are acquainted with Sir Hubert Marston.\" \" Intimately. I am going to him now.\" \" Nothing could be more opportune. I have most urgent and particular business with"], [16, "8 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. him ; and I want you to introduce me to him, that he may not take me for an impostor.\" \" I would do so with pleasure, Mr Dean, at any other moment. But just now it is useless. He is in great affliction, and will see no one. Indeed he is not capable of attend ing to business at present.\" \" I can well believe it. But Mr Digby, I am come to bring him news of his wife.\" \" Of Susan ! Where is she ? Is she safe and well ? \" \" Perfectly safe, and I trust not ill enough to alarm her friends. Where she is I am not at liberty to mention. Do you now see any difficulty in introducing me to Sir Hubert ? \" A few minutes brought them to the hotel, and Digby, leaving his companion down-stairs, went up to Marston's room to prepare him for his visitor. A very few words put Sir Hubert in possession of the facts. \" Of course you will see him,\" said his friend. \" Of course. But leave me to myself for a few minutes. I never knew how very dear she is to me till now. But I must not keep"], [17, "9 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. him waiting \u2022 by the time you can bring him up-stairs I shall be ready to receive him.\" Digby disappeared, and soon returned with the Dean. After introducing them to each other, he took his leave, promising to look in again in the course of the afternoon. As soon as he had retired, Marston, striving to conceal his agitation in the presence of a stranger by the measured coldness of his words, began the conversation . \"I understand, Mr Dean, that you bring me news of Lady Marston. I trust that she is safe and well.\" The Dean did not take so lenient a view of Sir Hubert's conduct as Caroline Marston had done, and he was moreover a good deal disgusted by the apparently indifferent tone in which the question had been put, which he attributed to downright heartlessness. Could he have witnessed the fervour with which, a moment before, Marston had re turned thanks to God for his wife's safety, no doubt he would have seen cause to alter his opinion. As it was, he replied with equal"], [18, "10 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. coldness, \" Yes, Sir Hubert, that is the ob ject of my visit. Lady Marston is quite safe, and has taken up her residence with a lady, for whose perfect respectability I can vouch. I regret to say that the events of the last eight-and-forty hours have shaken her con siderably, but I have no doubt that repose and tranquillity will restore her to health in the course of a day or two.\" \u2014 He had been cautioned against saying anything of the rail way accident, for fear of giving a citie. \" And may I ask,\" said Sir Hubert, \" where Lady Marston now is, and the name of the lady with whom she is residing ? \" \" I am sorry to say I am not at liberty to answer these questions. In fact, it was only on condition of my keeping her present abode secret, that Lady Marston has permitted me to inform you of her safety.\" It was not a judicious speech. Sir Hubert saw in it a fresh proof of his wife's utter indifference to his feelings. He coloured to the roots of his hair as he replied, \" Be it so. You may assure her that I shall not make the slightest attempt, directly or indirectly, to"], [19, "11 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. discover what she is so anxious to conceal. There are however some matters, on which it is absolutely necessary that I should commu nicate with her. Perhaps you will have the kindness to act as my delegate on the present occasion. The proofs you have already given of your good nature encourage me to hope that you will not refuse to extend it a little further.\" The Dean could not quite determine whether it was said ironically or not. He began to feel that he had undertaken a more trouble some business than he had anticipated. How ever, he was in for it \u2022 and he looked to Caro line Marston for a proper indemnification for any annoyance to which he might be exposed. He signified his willingness to act as the medium of communication between Sir Hu bert and his wife. \"In the first place, then,\" said Marston, \"I shall order all her things to be packed, and held at your disposal, which you will have the goodness to forward to her. I wish you also to inform her that, notwithstanding her refusal in the first instance, the half of my income is still at her disposal. She can"], [20, "12 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. draw on my bankers for it at her own discre tion \u2014 through you, if she pleases. Also, she may look upon the house in town as her own, or if she prefers residing at Thornwood, it is at her service. It will be long before I shall go there again myself. And now comes the most painful, the most distressing part of my communication. Are you acquainted with Lady Marston's history ? \" \" Only with what has occurred in the last few days, and that in a very general way.\" Sir Hubert paused for a short space, as if seeking for words with which to continue. When he spoke again it was in a much gentler tone of voice, and, at times, tremulous from emotion. \" I must begin, then, by informing you, that Lady Marston had a brother, Flarry Ashford, who went out to the Cape and India some years ago to seek his fortune. Others would expatiate on his worth ; I will only tell you, that he was my very dear friend. To him, under God, in all probability, I owe my life. Last year, he] succeeded to a large fortune, and married a young lady, to whom"], [21, "13 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. he was devotedly attached. Having no fur ther motive for remaining in India, he deter mined, as soon as he could complete all his arrangements, to return and settle in England. He was not able to effect this till a few months ago, when he took his passage with his new married wife, on board a vessel that was to touch at the Cape, where he had passed many years \u2014 where, indeed, I made his acquaint ance, and where he had several friends whom he was anxious to see again, before he left that part of the world for ever. Soon after they left the Cape, Mrs Ashford was grossly insulted by a Captain Burke, an officer in the Company's service, who was also returning to England by the same vessel. In a moment of intoxication he attempted to embrace her. Poor Harry, at no time very patient or for bearing \u2014 he was a little like his sister in that \u2014 did what any other man would have done under the circumstances ; he inflicted severe chastisement on the aggressor, who sent him a challenge as soon as they arrived at St Helena, where the vessel touched. They fought, and both fell dangerously wounded. As soon"], [22, "14 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. as the mischief was done, the police of the island made their appearance, and took them into custody ; but so strong were the repre sentations of all those on board, who were cognizant of the circumstances, in Harry's favour, that he was allowed to be removed to his ship, and to continue his voyage, the cap tain receiving instructions to deliver him over to the proper authorities on his arrival. Burke's wound was too severe to admit of his removal. The surgeon, who was called in to examine it, said at once that there was little hope of his recovery. If he should survive, he was to be sent home by the first vessel that sailed. Ashford made very little progress in his re covery during the voyage. The ball could not be extracted, and, in all probability, the agi tation of his mind at the thoughts of what awaited him in case of Burke's death, acted on him with injurious effect. But the sym pathy felt for him on board, and, especially, for his poor, young wife, barely nineteen, was great, and when they arrived in the Channel, with the assistance of some of the passengers and orew, and no doubt with the connivance of the"], [23, "15 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. captain, they were smuggled on board the ves sel which brought out the pilot. They reached London in safety; and two days after their arrival I again saw my old friend. His wife had waited for me in the street near my own house, and, after ascertaining who I was, made herself known to me, and brought me to the lodgings they occupied. They did not remain there long, but removed to a small house I took for them in St John's Wood. Here I passed many hours every day, and, whenever the weather permitted, took out Mrs Ashford for a walk or a drive, for her health too was beginning to suffer from close confinement. I should mention that almost the first words Harry Ashford uttered on seeing me, were to exact from me a solemn promise to mention his arrival to no one, least of all to his sister. He could not bear the thought of first seeing her after so long a separation, while his fate was so uncertain, with a criminal prosecution hanging over his head. He carried this feel ing so far, that he would not even allow his wife to inform her father of their arrival. He had left India when they did, but coming by"], [24, "16 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. the overland route, had already been some time in England. The day before yesterday I took Ellen to the Zoological Gardens. The lady whom Lady Marston saw on my arm was her sister-in-law. Poor, young thing, she was so happy. Harry had shown such signs of improvement, and we had heard that Captain Burke was so far recovered as to be out of all danger, and would come to England by the next vessel. It was the last day of happiness she will know for many a long year. The next day she was a widow. Yesterday morn ing when I called on them, I found Ashford seated in an arm-chair near the window. 'I am getting on famously, old fellow,' he said, and stretched out his hand to me, when, in the very act, he exclaimed \u2014 ' My God, what is this ! ' and fell back dead. The bullet had probably moved and touched some vital part. The agony of his wife I need not \u2014 I could not \u2014 describe. I sent at once for her father, who took her back with him to his own house. As soon as the funeral is over they will go to Scotland, where she will be confined in Sep tember. We have managed to avoid an inquest"], [25, "17 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. and, thank God, Harry never knew the un happy terms on which Lady Marston and my self have been living for some time past. That grief at least was spared him, which could not have been the case had he lived. This is the sad tale which I must entreat of you to convey to Lady Marston. But do it very gently, very cautiously ; for, notwithstanding their long separation, her affection for him was un abated. She loved him, as such a brother deserved to be loved, and was looking forward with so much pleasure to his return. Tell her, too, that he never spoke of her but in terms which proved that his love for her was as un changed as her own. God knows, if I could, I would spare her this great sorrow, but it cannot be. She must know it. Will you undertake to tell her ? \" \" If I must, I will. But surely her husband is the only person who ought to tell her of her brother's death, who alone can give her the consolation of which she will stand so much in need. It is what she has a right to expect.\" \" Of that, Mr Dean, I am the best judge ; and Lady Marston herself will tell you that VOL. III. 2"], [26, "18 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. she has made all direct communication be tween us impossible.\" \" Is then your determination irrevocable, Sir Hubert? Recollect, the circumstances under which Lady Marston saw you were such, as might well have deceived an older and more experienced person. Even I must en treat your forgiveness, for from what I heard, I confess, I judged you as she did.\" \" Mr Dean,\" replied Sir Hubert, \" I asked you to tell me where Lady Marston was, and under the plea of a promise of secrecy you re fused to tell me. Perhaps as a husband I had a right to insist, but I respected your scruples. I, in my turn, refuse to discuss with you a question, at which I would not allow my dear est and best friend so much as to hint.\" This answer seemed to give the Dean fresh matter for thought. He evidently wished to say something, but seemed hardly to know how to set about it. At length, he said, \" Sir Hubert, I wish to ask you one question, but it is of so delicate a nature that nothing could justify me in putting it, but the very deep interest I take in the lady with whom"], [27, "19 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Lady Marston is residing. Is there anything in Lady Marston's conduct to deserve the censure of society ? \" \" It is a delicate question,\" was the replv, \" but I am glad you have put it, that you may hear me emphatically declare that in thought, word, and deed, Lady Marston is pure as an angel. I know but of one fault in her, but that is one which strikes at the root of all domestic happiness. I do not seek to excuse myself. I have no doubt that by adopting a different course I might, to a certain extent, have avoided the rock on which we have made ship wreck. But to do so, I must have changed my very nature. Believe me, I am speaking in her interest, quite as much as in my own, when I say that, after the experience of our married life, my settled conviction is, that with our dispositions, the happiness, or at least the tranquillity, of both will be best promoted by our separation. You will not therefore be surprised to hear that I abide by the decision I expressed to Lady Marston two days ago, and in which all her actions prove that she acquiesces.\""], [28, "20 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. There was nothing more to be said. The Dean took his leave, and passed the whole of that evening in writing a despatch to Caroline Marston, upon whom devolved the painful task of informing Susan of all that had passed. But, notwithstanding all her caution, all the tenderness with which the disclosure was made, the shock was too great. Grief for her brother's death, remorse for her own conduct, despairing love for her husband, who was now, through her own fault, lost to her for ever, threw her back upon the bed of sickness, which she had only just been permitted to leave. Her agony of mind was terrible, and Dr Baird, who, though ignorant of the causes which produced it, witnessed its effects upon her weakened frame, declared that, if it con tinued, it must inevitably end in brain fever, and then he could not answer for the result. Caroline attended on her with a devotion which could not have been exceeded, had she really been her sister, instead of an acquaint ance of a few days' standing. For two days and nights she never quitted the sick-room, sleeping, when sleep she could, on a mattress"], [29, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 21 near the bed, but the greatest part of her time was spent in listening to Susan's lament ations for her brother, or her expressions of heart-broken repentance for the unmerited re proaches she had heaped upon her husband on that fatal day. Vain were her sister-in law's attempts at consolation. \" No, Caroline,\" she would say, \" he cannot, he ought not to for give me. To call him liar \u2014 my noble, my true hearted husband a liar! For he is mine, mine still. Though he has ceased to love me, I alone have a right to call him 'mine.' ' And then, perhaps half dreaming, half delirious, she would address her brother, as when they were boy and girl together in their dingy old dwell ing at Bayswater. Once she woke from a doze exclaiming, \" Oh, that Penge ! Save me, Hubert, save me ! \" She saw her sister in-law standing over her in great alarm. \"Oh, Caroline,\" she said, \" such a dream, such a horrid dream ! \" Fortunately, another direction was soon given to her thoughts. Dr Baird had been informed that Mrs Hubert was a connection of Lady Marston's. He saw that there was some"], [30, "22 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. mystery connected with her, but, with a dis cretion which is not always met with amongst gentlemen of his profession, he neither sought to penetrate the secret, whatever it might be, on his own account, nor made it a subject of conversation with others. One morning, how ever, he did say to Caroline, \" I presume your friend is married, at least I see a wedding-ring on her finger. Has she ever had any children ? \" Caroline was taken at a disadvantage. That particular topic had never made part of her conversations with her sister-in-law, and it was awkward to be obliged to confess her ignorance on so interesting a subject. After a moment's silence, however, she replied, \" I am not quite sure, but I believe not. She has not been married more than two years.\" \" At all events,\" said Dr Baird, \" unless I am very greatly mistaken, she is in a fair way of having one now, and that before many months are over her head. If she is not aware of her situation, she ought to be informed of it at once, for I have not the slightest doubt myself of the fact.\""], [31, "23 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Caroline Marston undertook to impart this important piece of information to her whom it principally concerned, with very different feel ings from those which she had experienced on the receipt of the Dean's letter. She saw in it her best auxiliary in combating Susan's despondency. It was with a light step and a lighter heart that she approached the bed on which Susan was lying, gazing vacantly at the ceiling, while the big tears rolled slowly down her cheeks. \" Do you not think, dear est,\" said her visitor, kissing her forehead, and wiping away her tears, \" that it would do you good to sit up a little ? It is\" such a lovely day, and you shall have the sofa drawn into the window.\" \" No, thank you, I had rather remain as I am. I do not think I shall ever wish to leave my bed again.\" \" Shall I sit down by your bed-side ? I want to talk to you, if it will not tire you.\" \" Yes, come and talk to me about him. Oh, Caroline, what would have become of me with out you ! \" Caroline Marston did as she was desired."], [32, "24 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" There is one point of your history, Susan,\" she said, \" on which you have never enlight ened me, and about which I confess I am a little curious. Have you ever had a child ? \" \"Ah, no ! Do you think that I could have left my child behind ? But that was a bless ing I did not deserve. Would to God I had, for then perhaps he would have pity on the mother of his child.\" \" Would it indeed have made you so happy ? Because if it would, Dr Baird thinks that there is every prospect of your being a mother before very long.\" Susan almost threw herself out of her bed as she clutched her sister-in-law's hand. \" Caroline, Caroline, do not deceive me ; do not give me false hopes, for the disappoint ment would be more than I could bear.\" \" My dear Susan, try to calm yourself. It is not I, but Dr Baird who gives you hopes, and I have every confidence in him.\" Susan's tears flowed faster than before ; but they were not now the bitter tears of sorrow. \" Is it indeed possible,\" she cried, \" that such"], [33, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 25 happiness is reserved for me ? Always, al ways, when I have least dared to hope for it, I have received consolation in my distress. Oh that I but knew how to show my gratitude for the many mercies which have been vouchsafed to me ! Teach me, Caroline ; teach me as you would a little child, and pray for me, that if I have been a bad wife, I may at least be a good mother.\" \"With such feelings, your own heart will be your best guide. But I will not allow you to talk any more just now, for you need rest.\" And in truth Susan's flushed cheeks gave token of her excitement. \" When you are more equal to it we will discuss it all quietly, for we have plenty to talk about. At present you must not utter another word, or you will drive me away.\" \"Just one word, Caroline; when is Dr Baird coming again ? \" \" He said he should look in this evening.\" And in the evening the doctor did pay Susan another visit, in which, after a long conversation with her, he not only adhered to the opinion he had already expressed, but"], [34, "26 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. told her that, as far as he could judge, she might expect her confinement in the course of the autumn. \" Oh, how I hope it will be a boy ! \" she exclaimed. \" I think my husband would so much like to have a son.\""], [35, "27 CHAPTER II. As Caroline Marston had observed, there was much to be- discussed ; and, as is not unusual on such occasions, there was much difference of opinion. Caroline insisted on the propriety of informing Sir Hubert of the expected addition to his family at once, argu ing that it was not only his right to receive the earliest intimation of an event so deeply interesting to him, but that it could not fail to open the door to a complete reconciliation. But Susan had formed a plan of her own, and as usual, succeeded in silencing all opposition ; for, by degrees, her own firmness and decision of character obtained complete ascendancy over the more yielding nature of her sister-in-"], [36, "28 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. law. Her intention was to say nothing to any one till the event had taken place, and then, with the child in her arms, to present herself suddenly before her husband, and implore his forgiveness. \"I dare not go back to him now,\" she said, \" in opposition to his declared will ; and if I write he will have time for reflection, and perhaps repulse me. He would not believe in my repentance. I cannot risk it ; but if I wait, and take him by surprise, it cannot be but that, when he sees his son, he will relent towards the mother.\" Susan had quite made up her mind that it was to be a son. \" It must be as you will,\" replied Caroline. \" But, believe me, you do your husband in justice in thinking him capable of such unfor giving conduct.\" \" Ah, Caroline, you do not know how stern, how cold, how determined he can be. Per haps he might even take measures for depriv ing me of my child.\" Caroline wondered if this was indeed the Hubert Marston she had once known \u2014 the"], [37, "29 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. gentlest, the most kind-hearted, the most placable of men ; and she felt a pang of re morse, as she thought that it was perhaps her own conduct that had worked such a change in his nature. But the truth was \u2014 although, perhaps, she was unconscious of it \u2014 that Susan shrank from the thoughts of an inter view with the husband whom she had so cruelly wronged, and endeavoured to justify its postponement by allegations, which had some show of reason. In her defence, it may be said, that they were made rather for her own satisfaction, to quiet her own conscience, than for any other purpose. Could she have guessed the impression they made on her friend, she would have retracted them with a cry of self-accusation. From another quarter, too, she met with remonstrances, which she found it difficult to answer. The Dean of Newport, who might, with perfect propriety, have put up the Mar ston arms over his door, and styled himself \" Commissioner for conducting the affairs of Lady Marston,\" forwarded to Mrs Hubert half-a-dozen immense packages containing all"], [38, "30 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. her wardrobe, trinkets, books, and, in short, all that was hers. And with them came several letters : one from. Lord Deptford, written in the highest spirits, and giving the most ludicrous description, not only of all he had seen, but of all he expected to see. He was on the eve of marching from the camp near Varna with the troops destined for the reconnaissance towards the Danube. Another was from Lucy Digby. \" Susan, dearest Susan,\" it began, \" how could you be so cruel as to leave us in such a state of anxiety about you ! For two days and nights, neither your husband nor mine took off their clothes. But I will not scold you now, poor dear ; I will keep that till we meet. What I have to say is this. My hus band strongly advises your leaving your mys terious abode, and taking up your residence at Thornwood till this cloud has blown over, for blow over it must. Or, if you prefer it, come to us. John authorizes me to say that you will find a home here if you like, where you shall live as retired as you please ; and no questions will be asked to tease you."], [39, "31 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. In short, you will be entirely your own mis tress. I cannot tell you, dearest, how it pains me to be obliged to have recourse to the Dean of Newport to forward this letter. Will you not place a little confidence in one who loves you so well as your affectionate cousin, \"LucrD.\" Nor, indeed, was it with less pain that Susan sent her an answer through the same channel, and thought herself obliged to keep herself still enveloped in the same cloud of mystery. \" Thanks, dearest Lucy,\" she wrote, in re turn, \" to you and your dear husband for your kindness to one, who deserves it so little as I do. You, in your happy home, can little know the comfort, the happiness it gives me in my wretchedness, to find that I am not utterly cast off and disowned by all those whom I love. But I cannot go to Thorn wood, where the few happy hours of my life have been passed. I cannot accept your offer. I have incurred, and most justly, the heavy displeasure of my husband. How could I inhabit his house? How could I meet his"], [40, "32 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. friends ? I will never again appear amongst those whom I have known, till I can do so purified from my fault by his forgiveness ; if, indeed, he can ever extend it to me. But believe me, Lucy, when I so grievously offended him, I was mad. It was my very love for him that urged me on. But God has been very good to me. I have found a friend, who has taken me into her house, who tended me when I was ill with the care of a sister, who does her best to soothe and console me. My poor brother's death was, as you may imagine, a grievous addition to my sorrows. I felt as if I had lost the last, the only support to whom I could cling ; and for a few days I was con fined to my bed. I am now much better, and, as far as bodily health is concerned, have no doubt of being myself again in a day or two. God bless you and yours. Do not quite forget your grateful and affectionate \" Susan.\" To this resolution she adhered, notwithstand ing Lucy's representations that Sir Hubert had been informed of her offer ; and, if he had not expressly approved of it, had, at all"], [41, "33 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. events, offered no objection to it. By this time every one was aware of Lady Marston's secession from her husband's house, and, of course, the causes assigned were as various as the minds and dispositions of the commenta tors. Sir Flubert authorized his friends to say, for few ventured to question him directly on the subject, that Lady Marston had gone into the country to pay a long visit to a friend, and that the time of her return was uncertain. Lady Deptford, indeed, endeavoured to obtain more precise information, urged thereto by various considerations, amongst which her dis like to Susan was the most prominent. She told her brother that it behoved him to be more explicit in his communications ; that there was, on one hand, a report current that his wife had been compelled to leave his house by his ill-treatment and profligacy ; while, on the other, there were not wanting those who reversed the picture, and asserted that she had not fled unaccompanied. Marston cut her very short. He told her that he was aware there were such rumours, and also that they, both of them, emanated from the same person. VOL. III. 3"], [42, "34 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" In fact, Emily,\" he continued, \" it is from this house that they are put in circulation. I do not accuse you of inventing these slanders, but I do accuse you of giving the inventor of them encouragement, at least, by listening to them, and repeating them to your friends and acquaintance. For myself, I despise these stories as heartily' as I do their author ; and as for Lady Marston, young as she is, her character is too well established to be assail able by the calumnies of such a contemptible wretch as Mr Penrhys. But it is time this should end. You must choose between him and me. If you continue to receive him, this is the last time I shall set foot in your house.\" Lady Deptford wept, and protested that he was mistaken, but Sir Hubert was inflexible ; and as he could not succeed in extracting from her the promise he required \u2014 for Pen rhys had obtained a strange ascendancy over her \u2014 he carried his threat into execution. \" Farewell, Emily,\" were his parting words. \" I have endeavoured to act a brother's part to you, and I cannot say that I have met with"], [43, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 35 much return. At a time when a sister's sym pathy would have been invaluable to me, it was withheld ; and now, when I ask you for a proof of your regard for my honour, you meet me with a refusal. But, be warned in time. That man has alienated from you your chil dren and your brother. He is utterly un worthy of your confidence ; and if you con tinue to treat him on the footing of an intimate friend, the day will come when you will bitterly repent it.\" Lord Windermere and Sir Richard Bertie were but too glad to follow suit. They both intimated to Lady Deptford that, out of re spect for Sir Hubert Marston's feelings, they must decline allowing their wives to visit at a house where they were exposed to meeting Mr Penrhys. Against this decision the two ladies in question offered no remonstrance. Their mother's regime, while they were still unmarried, had left no very pleasing recollec tions on their minds ; they were very fond of their uncle ; they thought of Susan with affec tion, whenever they had time to think of her at all ; and they detested Mr Penrhys, who,"], [44, "36 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. it was understood, was in some mysterious way connected with the estrangement between Sir Hubert Marston and his wife. Even from her ally Lady Deptford did not meet with the commendation, which her de votion to him deserved. He was thoroughly out of humour with the turn which things were taking, and he rated her soundly for having lost the opportunity of reinstating her self in the office of mistress of Sir Hubert's house, now that the disappearance of his wife had left the post vacant. \" You had the ball at your foot,\" he said. \" By seeming to discard me, you might have gained credit with your brother for making a great sacrifice, and have done with him what you liked. Sooner or later you would have brought about a reconciliation between us. Now, you have brought down a regular ava lanche on both our heads.\" And this was only the truth. The world has, at least, this in its favour, \u2014 it is extremely impartial. If it likes to hear false witness borne against its neighbour, it is not sorry to find a crevasse in the armour of those who"], [45, "37 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. bear it. Mr Penrhys, whose admiration for Susan was fast turning into hatred, was very witty and caustic in his observations on the Marstons, and found plenty of laughers, though his cynical temper was too well known for his insinuations \u2014 he never ventured beyond in sinuation \u2014 to produce much effect. But, when his back was turned, those who had listened to his observations with the greatest zest, were the first to exclaim against the shame less effrontery of a man, who, while living on the most intimate terms with the sister, did his best to ridicule and defame the brother and sister-in-law. One guess was made as to his motives, not very far from the truth. \" I suppose the fact is,\" said Colonel S., \"he made love to my Lady, and my Lady sent him about his business ; small blame to her ! \" Nor did Lady Deptford escape censure for the patronage she continued to extend to the assailant of her brother, though the more charitable \u2014 they were not numerous \u2014 con cluded that in her presence, at all events, he refrained from his attacks."], [46, "38 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Marston, as has been remarked more than once, was a general favourite ; his wife, during her short appearance in society, had acquired many friends without making an enemy, while her beauty had secured for her many an un known champion ready to do battle in her cause. Penrhys had no friends, \u2014 he professed indeed not to wish for them. \" I had rather be feared than loved,\" was his profession of faith ; but, on the other hand, there were many who had smarted beneath his sarcasms, and who were not sorry to take their revenge. By degrees, he found his position in society by no means as pleasant as it had been. Women, indeed, shrank from making an enemy of a man whose tongue spared no one ; but his most pungent remarks on their presumed rivals were received with a constrained laugh, and the flimsiest pretexts were seized upon with alacrity for escaping the tetes-a-tetes, which had once been supposed to confer a sort of social distinction. Men were less scrupulous, or less timid, and met his advances with a coldness which was something new. When"], [47, "39 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. he entered his Club, instead of seeing an ad miring coterie gather round him, to laugh at his jokes and applaud his sayings, his appear ance was the signal for the dispersion of any group which he might approach ; or, if he did succeed in joining them, his observations elicited no reply, and as soon as he had ceased speaking, the original conversation was re sumed as if he had not been present. In short, he found himself on the high road to Coventry, and he felt that his only chance of regaining his position was by striking a bold stroke before it was too late. He had no lack of courage, and he determined to go to the fountain-head from which he presumed this torrent of disfavour to flow; and this fountain-head he settled in his own mind to be Sir Hubert Marston. In this he was wrong. The real cause of the animosity now shown him was his own malevolence and insufferably overbearing dis position. Some, no doubt, were disgusted with the way in which he spoke of the Mars tons ; but with the majority it was but a pre-"], [48, "40 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. text. As for Sir Hubert himself, he avoided as much as possible all mention of his enemy's name. He was not one to descant upon his own grievances. He felt himself quite competent to fight his own battles without any one's assistance ; and, fully intending to call Mr Penrhys to account at the very first fair open ing, he disdained entering upon a war of words. Nevertheless, when compelled to speak of him it was in terms of unmitigated contempt. Between two such congenial spirits \u2014 for Penrhyswas nowas eager for the fray as Marston could possibly be \u2014 it was not difficult to find an unexceptionable plea for gratifying their bellicose propensities. At a large dinner party Sir Hubert had expressed his disbelief of some scandalous story just then current. \" I assure you, Sir Hubert,\" said a lady thoughtlessly, \" I heard all the particulars from Mr Penrhys.\" \" In that case, Lady Eleanor,\" was the re ply, \" if you have no better authority than Mr Penrhys, you may be quite certain it is not true.\" This speech was repeated to Penrhys by"], [49, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 41 some good-natured friend, and the following evening he made his appearance in the smoking-room of the Club to which he and Marston belonged. \" Sir Hubert,\" he said, going straight up to him, \" I have been informed that yesterday you made use of these expressions,\" and he repeated them. \" I wish to know if my in formation is correct.\" \" Upon my word, Mr Penrhys,\" replied Marston, without taking his cigar from his mouth, \" after this lapse of time I cannot take upon myself to say what were the precise words I used, but as I am very much in the habit of saying what I think, I have no doubt I spoke to that effect.\" Penrhys was rather taken aback by this very explicit avowal, but he soon recovered himself. He came prepared for a quarrel, but his intention was to drive Sir Hubert into a corner, and if possible drag Susan's name into the discussion, than which, he was well aware, nothing could be more disagreeable to his adversary. \" I thank you, Sir Hubert,\" he said, \" for"], [50, "42 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. your candour, but you comprehend it will be more satisfactory to me, if you will condescend to state the grounds upon which you dared to use such language respecting me.\" But Sir Hubert was in no humour for lengthened explanations. The opening, for which he had been so long waiting, was at last offered him, and he availed himself of it at once. Flis answer was concise, and to the purpose. \" Because I believe you to be addicted to every sort of evil-speaking, lying, and slander ing,\" he said with the utmost composure. This time Penrhys' assumed calmness de serted him. He made a step towards Marston, who did not even attempt to rise from his chair ; but some of those present, amongst whom was Lord Windermere, apprehensive of an act of personal violence, threw themselves between the two. Without saying a word, Mr Penrhys turned on his heel, and left the room. But next morning, while Sir Hubert was at breakfast, Major Mallory was announced;"], [51, "43 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. and on being admitted, stated that he came on the part of his friend, Mr Penrhys, to demand either an ample apology for the outrageous language which had been applied to him on the previous evening, or, in case of that being refused, to propose an excursion to the coast of France, with a view to a hostile meeting. The latter alternative was the one selected by Marston, who referred the Major to Lord Windermere. At the appointed time, the parties met at Calais. \" Windermere,\" said Marston, \" I mean, if I can, to give Mr Penrhys a lesson, and that you know may bring me to grief, as, in the eyes of an intelligent jury, it will certainly appear that all the provocation came from me. Now as I have no desire to be hanged for doing my duty to society, this is what I wish you to pro pose to Major Mallory. Go and engage two French sons-officiers for each of us, to act as our seconds. There will be no difficulty about that. Then you and Mallory can sit quietly at home, keeping yourselves out of the scrape, and, what is quite as important, putting it out"], [52, "44 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. of your power to give evidence in case of a prosecution.\" Lord Windermere was a little staggered by this declaration of his friend's intentions. Apparently, he had not fully realized the dif ficulties of his position, and it flashed across him that, if any harm befell his principal, a large share of the blame would fall upon him self. But, to do him justice, his own respon sibility was that which weighed with him the least. He was sincerely attached to Marston. He shuddered at the thought of what might be the end of the adventure, and he faintly suggested the possibility of some sort of com promise which might satisfy Mr Penrhys, without actually having recourse to the last argument of angry men. \"My dear Windermere,\" said Marston, \" all compromise is out of the question. So far from retracting one word of what I said, I am quite ready to publish a second edition, revised and enlarged ; and, to do him justice, Penrhys is not the man to sit down quietly under such an insult. In short, there is nothing for it but to drink the wine, now that"], [53, "45 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. the cork is drawn. You know, as well as I do, this has been brewing for a long time. Why or wherefore I know not, but he hates me, and never loses an opportunity of showing it, and I have no extravagant feeling of affection for him. He came to the Club the other evening for the express purpose of quarrelling with me, and I was determined not to baulk him. And now the case stands thus. Mr Penrhys will kill me if he can ; I will not do that by him if I can help it, but in self-defence I must put it out of his power to take a second shot at me.\" \"Are you then so sure of yourself?\" asked Lord Windermere. \" I only wish Deptford were here to tell you how many half-crowns I won of him at Thorn wood last year, by bringing down swallows on the wing with a pistol, poor devils. It is my only accomplishment.\" \" One other question I must ask,\" said Lord Windermere, with a slight tremour in his voice. \" In case \u2014 \" \" I know what you are going to say. Well, if I am killed, but not else, you will send a"], [54, "46 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. letter, which is in my writing-desk, to my wife. My will is in Digby's hands. I have left her everything for her life. Afterwards Thornwood will go to Deptford, and my personal property will be divided amongst my sister's other children. And tell them all, as I now tell you, that I conjure them to treat Susan with all honour and affection. If we have not quite hit it off together, no doubt the fault is as much mine as hers. We all have our faults, but believe me she is a pearl beyond price ; a loving heart, and true as steel. Promise me you will be kind and gentle to her, for she will need it.\" Lord Windermere was much affected by this appeal at such a moment. \" You know,\" he said, \" we all love her, and I promise you, in my wife's name as well as my own, that we will treat her and cherish her as a sister. But surely, after bearing such testimony to her worth, your separation cannot last much longer.\" \" Hush, my dear fellow. On that subject not a word.\" Penrhys' intentions were quite as blood-"], [55, "47 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. thirsty as his antagonist gave him credit for ; he jumped at Sir Hubert's proposal. They met and fought in the French fashion, a. la barriere, in the presence of four non-commis sioned officers and the surgeon of their regi ment, who, catching at anything to break the monotony of his existence, had volunteered his services. Penrhys fired first, and with so true an aim that he knocked Marston's hat off his head. \" Well intended,\" muttered Sir Hubert, as he caught his hat in its descent and replaced it. \" Mr Penrhys,\" he said aloud, after cover ing him with his pistol, \" I give you your life.\" And turning round, he fired at and killed an unfortunate gull, which happened at the moment to be flying past the scene of action, unconscious of danger. The object of this magnanimity did not ap preciate it as it deserved. On the contrary, he was furious, and insisted upon continuing, but his own seconds declared that it was quite out of the question; and the surgeon, who,"], [56, "48 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. from the deference with which he was listened to, appeared to be an authority in such mat ters, intimated that such a proceeding would be a violation de toutes les convenances. The others would do as they pleased, but he would not stay to witness it. Penrhys withdrew from the ground in high dudgeon, and without the formality of taking leave, which want of courtesy elicited from the bystanders a pro longed \" C'rrre nom d'un nom, voila un parti culier bicn mat Sieve I\" Not so Sir Hubert. Turning to the seconds and raising his hat, he asked if he had done his duty as a man of honour, to which a unanimous \" Parbleu \" was the satisfactory answer. \" Permit me, then,\" he said, \" to thank you all for your services, and do me the favour to accept the contents of this purse to be divided amongst you. Moi aussi fai servi, et entre camarades cela se fait.\" A dogma, which was at once accepted as an article of faith by those to whom it was ad dressed. \" I could not do it,\" he said to Lord Win-"], [57, "49 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. dermere, when recounting to him the events of the morning. \" When I saw him so com pletely in my power, I felt it would be like murder.\" In the mean time Susan and Caroline Mar ston pursued the even tenour of their way un disturbed. Susan's health was completely re stored, and, with the new hopes inspired by her situation, her spirits, or at least her cheer fulness, returned. She was shocked to find how transitory had been the impression made on her by her brother's death. She accused herself of hardness of heart, and want of natural affection, forgetting that, however severe might have been the wound caused by the death of one whom she had not seen for years, it must of necessity make a less durable effect than that of one, less dearly loved perhaps, but whose loss, from constant association, would leave a void in the routine of daily life. When she first heard of Harry Ashford's fate, it fell on her with double force, as a dreadful and unexpected aggravation of the wretchedness under which she was then suffering. She had reckoned on him as a counsellor and support, VOL. III. 4"], [58, "50 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. as one who in her need would give her a home, and to whom she could pour out her troubles, sure of his sympathy. When he was gone, it seemed to her as if her last hope on earth had been wrested from her, at the very moment when his assistance was most required, when his mediation might have obtained for her a mitigation of her husband's anger. But now that mediation would no longer be needed. She had worked herself into the firm persua sion that, when she placed her son in her husband's arms, their reconciliation must follow as a matter of course. Could Hubert, on such an occasion, refuse to listen to her cry of repentance, could he reject her prayers for forgiveness ! Caroline Marston took very much the same view of the case. She had ceased to urge on Susan the expediency of communicating her situation to her husband, partly because she saw that her chance of success was but small, and partly because her friend and ally, Dr Crossby, strongly advised delay. He had seen enough in his interview with Sir Hubert to feel convinced, that any appeal to him from his"], [59, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 51 -wife at that time would be out of season. It is true, the worthy dean had not been initiated into the secret of Lady Marston's hopes. On this point Susan was inflexible, and her sister in-law yielded. But though, in all these domestic matters, Susan was allowed to have her own way, Caroline soon began to exercise over her, on subjects of greater importance, an influence as steady as it was beneficial. The elder Lady Marston had known sorrow also, and sorrow, in a great measure, of her own making ; but she accepted it in a meek and unrepining spirit, as the punishment justly due to the transgressions of her youth. If she was chas tised, she felt that it was by the hand of a Father, and she set resolutely to work to eradicate, or, at least, to bring under control, those infirmities of disposition in which her errors had originated. To education she owed little or nothing ; but she had a strong reli gious instinct, which, although it had received no encouragement during the years of her girlhood and married life, only needed the fostering hand of adversity to develope. Her"], [60, "52 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. father and mother, in good old country fashion, went to church when it was not too damp or too cold, to set a good example to their de pendents ; but, practically, they were as much in a state of heathenism as Sir Charles Mar ston, who, with a chosen band of canine and human attendants, generally devoted his Sun day mornings to the extirpation of rats from his barns and stables. Although Caroline felt that there was some thing wrong in all this, she was not one to set herself up in judgment upon those who were in authority over her ; but her own be reavement by the sudden death of her husband, from whom she had parted two hours before in all the pride of youth and strength, and who was brought home only to die, raised more serious thoughts in her mind. The danger now seemed to be, lest she should rush into the other extreme, and throw herself into the arms of the first theological empiric who would undertake to show her a short and sure road to salvation. She was already far gone in bewilderment over the mysteries of election and predestination, when, in the second year"], [61, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 53 of her widowhood, she had the good fortune to make the acquaintance of Dr Crossby, who was passing the vacation at Highbeach. He neither was, nor pretended to be, a profound theologian ; but he was a man of sense ; a firm believer in the excellence of the Church to which he belonged, teaching her doctrines with zeal and simplicity, inculcating universal charity, and practising what he preached. The particulars of Caroline Marston's his tory were not known at Highbeach; but enough transpired to satisfy the curious, that she, who now occupied a small house with a couple of servants, had, a few months before, been the mistress of a princely mansion, with a corresponding establishment, \u2014 that the wife of one of the oldest and wealthiest baronets of England was now a widow, living in ob scurity upon small means. This came to Dr Crossby's ears \u2014 he was not Dean yet \u2014 and he could not forbear admiring the resignation with which she seemed to bear her lot. Per haps \u2014 for even D.D.s are but men \u2014 her youth and beauty,, which her mourning garb could not conceal, had a little, a very little, to"], [62, "54 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. do in influencing his judgment. Lady Mar ston studiously avoided making acquaintance, but a trifling service which Dr Crossby had it in his power to render her paved the way to an introduction, and he asked permission to pay her a visit. He came, he saw, and was conquered. The first week he drank tea with her once, the second twice, and so on in progression, till he began to think that no tea was worth the trouble of drinking, unless made and poured out by Lady Marston. She, too, soon began to look forward to his visit as the great event of the day ; and, before long, she took him into her confidence, exposing to him all her doubts and difficulties, which he solved and removed, according to his lights, in the simplest manner and clearest language possible. She professed herself perfectly sat isfied. Could a Doctor of Divinity, and such a Doctor, be wrong ! Before Dr Crossby's holidays were over, they had come to a perfect understanding, not only upon religious sub jects, but upon matters of a more temporal nature. Caroline insisted on making a full confession of all the errors of her past life,"], [63, "55 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. though the Doctor in vain attempted to stop her. It gave him, however, a pretext for doing what he had long been wishing to do, but had never yet ventured upon. To his own surprise, as much as to hers, he sum moned up courage to kiss her, probably by way of giving her absolution. At that time Dr Crossby had nothing but his fellowship, and their marriage was, per force, deferred till some piece of preferment should fall in. It was only a few weeks be fore Susan's escapade that the Deanery of Newport had been conferred upon him \u25a0 and various reasons, unnecessary to mention, in duced them to put off their union for some months longer. He frequently contrived, how ever, to pay flying visits to Highbeach, where he made Susan's acquaintance, and soon took as much interest in her for her own sake, as he had hitherto done in obedience to her sister-in-law's behests."], [64, "56 CHAPTER III. The life upon which Susan now entered had, at least, the charms of novelty to recom mend it. The nearest approach she had made to it had been during the year she had passed at Mrs Tindal's ; but there her time had been devoted exclusively and conscientiously to re pairing the defects of her education. Her lessons occupied the whole of her mornings, her evenings were passed in reading or prac tising; for Mrs Tindal, with all her good qualities, had not much to say for herself in the way of mere conversation. From tea to bed-time the silence was seldom broken, ex cept by an occasional remark on Susan's exe-"], [65, "57 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. cution of some musical passage, or an appeal to her for assistance in selecting the right shade of lamb's-wool. Now and then a visitor would drop in, but, as Mrs Tindal's acquaint ance were all people of her own age and habits, after the first greeting, her pupil's presence seemed to be completely ignored \u2014 a circum stance for which that young lady was rather thankful than otherwise. She was left to pur sue the train of her own thoughts undisturbed, and her thoughts gave her ample occupation, though they were not exactly of such a nature that she would have wished to discuss them with others. But now, how different ! In her sister-in law Susan found not only a companion, but a friend, on whose sympathy she could rely, and to whom every secret of her heart was con fided. Except in moments of great excite ment, she was not by nature communicative, and this disposition had been strengthened by the miserable position in which her childhood had been passed. But something there was in Caroline Marston which enforced confid ence \u2014 something which seemed to say, \" I will"], [66, "58 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. make no unworthy use of the trust you place in me ; but if I can give you consolation and good counsel, I will.\" They lived in strict seclusion, for they neither of them felt any wish for society ; and day after day passed away without leaving any trace behind, as regarded the outer world, but marked by ever-varying subjects of inter est in their conversation and the simple details of their domestic life. On almost every point Caroline was inferior to Susan. She felt it and acknowledged it, without even a sigh of envy or mortification. She had neither Susan's beauty nor her intelligence ; she could not compete with her in argument, and even on those subjects to which female education is more particularly directed, she found that Susan's proficiency was greater than her own. But in one respect she was immeasurably her superior. She was a sincere and believing Christian ; Susan was so but in name, with nothing but the most vague and crude ideas on the subject of religion at all. Marston, as we have seen, when he became aware of Susan's deficiencies in this respect,"], [67, "59 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. had promised his assistance in solving the difficulties under which she laboured, and this promise he fully intended to perform as soon as they were settled ; but, somehow or other, when once they were established at the Priory, he never found time or opportunity for carry ing out his intention. Perhaps, when he saw his wife attending church and family prayers, with great regularity and apparent devotion, he thought there was no longer any necessity for it. At Thornwood, too, she visited the cottages of his labourers, was charitable to the full extent of her means, and when these were exhausted, had recourse to him. What more could be desired ! It was something, no doubt, but Caroline thought it was not enough. She had been a good deal shocked, and still more grieved, when she discovered how ignorant her sister-in-law was of the first principles of the religion she professed ; and as she, at any rate, had plenty of time and opportunity, she determined to spare no pains, to neglect no means, for put tina things on a more satisfactorv footing. Nor was it long before she found her efforts"], [68, "60 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. gradually crowned with success. If Susan was ignorant, it was because she had never found any one able and willing to instruct her ; but now she caught eagerly at the op portunity offered her, and Caroline was not more earnest in her desire to impart know ledge than she was to receive it. Whatever she did, she did with passion ; and it was with passionate fervour that she threw herself on the mercy of the God, Who had hitherto been to her rather a dream than a reality, \u2014 for Whom her heart had yearned, but Whom she now knew for the first time. Acting on the judicious advice of Dr Crossby, Caroline began at the beginning, treating Susan, as, indeed, she had expressed a wish to be treated, as a child ; but the child soon grew too strong for the mistress. Not content with Caroline's very clear expositions of the fundamental doc trines of the Christian religion, she plunged headlong into the most abstruse questions of imaginative theology, but in a totally differ ent direction from that to which her sister-in law had been attracted. Caroline was quite unable to follow her; her small truck of"], [69, "61 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. divinity was fairly run off the rails, and she endeavoured in vain to check the spirit of en quiry which she had raised, and the progress of which she was beginning to dread. For tunately, whilst she was in the midst of her perplexities, the Dean happened to come to Highbeach for a few days, as he had often done before. Susan naturally appealed to him for the solution of some mysterious passage in the Book of Revelations. She had invested ten shillings in a very clever work on that subject, but, unfortunately, on this particular point it gave her no information. \" My dear Susan,\" he began. \" I beg your pardon, Lady Marston \u2014 \" \"No, no; call me Susan. It looks as if you cared for me.\" \" Well, then, my dear Susan, it is because I do care for you, because I feel a real interest and affection for you \" \u2014 Susan could not re frain from stealing a look at her sister-in-law to see how she bore this declaration, but her sister-in-law seemed to think it quite natural ; at least, she gave no outward signs of disap probation \u2014 \" It is because I do care for you,"], [70, "62 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. that I strongly advise you not to indulge in this sort of speculation, which can do no good, and may do much harm. Depend upon it, what it is good or necessary for us to know is said clearly enough ; and what we are not intended to know, we have no right to pry into. In fact, it is presumptuous to do so.\" \" But I have got some books which seem to explain all these points very clearly.\" \" Then take my advice and burn them. They are the blind leading the blind. I say it very seriously, these are temptations which you ought to resist ; for with your imagina tive and enthusiastic temperament there is no saying to what they may lead.\" Then in a lighter tone, he continued, \" Why, if you go on at this rate, we shall have you, like the schoolmen of old, disputing upon the number of angels who can stand upon the point of a needle.\" \" Thank you, Mr Dean \u2022 I feel you speak like a friend, and I will follow your advice.\" She left the room, but returned in a few minutes with half-a-dozen volumes under her arm, which she straightway flung on to the"], [71, "63 SIR HUBERT MARST0N. fire. The Dean jumped up in great alarm, and, at the risk of burning his fingers, dragged them off again. \" My dear child,\" he said, \" do you want to set the chimney on fire ? Do not add to the other mischiefs, for which these would-be interpreters of prophecy may have to answer, that of burning your friend's house down.\" Before Susan retired for the night, she whispered to Caroline, \"You may tell him about baby, only he must remember it is a great secret.\" The longer Susan lived with Caroline Mar ston, the more she found to admire and reflect upon. She herself had known the two extremes of poverty and opulence. In her father's house she had discharged the most menial offices, scantily clad, with coarse and often insuffi cient food, the victim of domestic tyranny and parsimony ; the last two years of her life had been passed in the midst of every luxury that wealth can command, with no wish un gratified that money could realize. She had only to ask and to have. Now she found herself the member of a household, in which"], [72, "64 SIR HUBERT MARST0N. every necessary comfort, indeed, was to be found, but regulated upon the strictest prin ciples of economy. Caroline Marston was far from rich. Her dower was five hundred a year, and, till Susan insisted upon contribut ing her share to their expenditure, it was all she had. But her establishment, though small, was not unbefitting her station in life. If there was no ostentation, there was nothing niggardly about it. To her two servants she was a considerate and indulgent mistress ; there was no pinching in the kitchen to make a show in the parlour; but so good was her management, and so great her self-denial, where self only was concerned, that she was always able to devote a very considerable por tion of her income to relieving the necessities of her poorer neighbours. And the manner in which her charities were dispensed, the kind words with which they were accompanied, greatly enhanced their value. She was not a member of a Dorcas Society \u2014 she was not even enrolled as a district-visitor ; but her visits were none the less welcome on that account. She made a point of becoming"], [73, "SIR HUBERT MARST0N. 65 personally acquainted with those whom she assisted, and with many of them she was on terms of friendly intercourse. For Caroline really took an interest in the Poor, and the Poor quickly made the discovery that in her they had a friend, who could feel for their sorrows, comfort them in their afflictions, and sympathize with their rare and simple plea sures. No need, when she entered the cot tage, to hustle the paralytic old grandfather out of the easy chair, to give the baby a good shaking to stop its cries, or push the table out of the way, under penalty of seeing the tea things swept off it by the voluminous folds of her dress. Lady Marston took the first seat that offered, were it stool or chest, and entered into conversation with the inmates as naturally and easily as if she had been in her ow*n drawing-room. Susan was soon initiated into these occupa tions, though it was some time before she was quite at home in them. Ideal poverty, as described in novels, or represented on the stage, may be made attractive, but it is a very different thing from the real, genuine poverty VOL. III. 5"], [74, "66 SIR HUBERT MARST0N. of the labouring classes. We often meet with the phrase \" decent poverty,\" but it is hardly too much to assert, that, as regards the work ing population, it does not\u2014 and housed, or, rather, roomed, if the expression may be allowed, as they are, it cannot \u2014 exist. What sense of decency or shame can be expected in a family where father and mother, and half-a dozen children of all ages sleep in the same room, oftentimes in the same bed ! We may lecture, preach, educate as much as we please, but, till we give our Poor dwellings as com modious as those which we build for our dogs, our pigs, and our poultry, we can never hope to raise in them a feeling of self-respect, without which to work on, all our labour will be in vain. The seed sown may be good, but it will fall on uncongenial soil, and bring forth no fruit. It was with such poverty as this that Susan now became acquainted for the first time in her life, and the picture was not a pleasant one. If the truth must be told, she was often thoroughly disgusted by the dirt and untidi ness which met her eyes in the hovels of the"], [75, "67 SIR HUBERT MARST0N. fishing population of Highbeach, so different from the neat cottages of Thornwood, or even of Acton. The children were so rude and noisy, the women were so slovenly, the men so coarse and loud ; and, on one occasion, Paterfamilias had evidently taken more liquor than was good for him. \" How you can bear it, Caroline ! \" she said, on leaving the hovel. \" You, so refined in all your tastes, to listen so quietly to that drunken brute, who was half inclined to be insolent. If I had been alone, I should not have liked it at all.\" \" Oh, there was no danger,\" said Caroline, laughing ; \" his wife was there to keep him in order. But he is not given to drink. He is a real hard-working man. Did not you hear his wife say that he had been out in the boat for six-and-thirty hours ? At least, he had some excuse for his intemperance ; and I will bet you sixpence for the poor-box, that he brings me a lobster, or something of that sort, to-morrow morning, by way of apology.\" Susan, who was a gambler at heart, took the bet and lost it."], [76, "68 SIR HUBERT MARST0N. \" But,\" she said, \" if I were you, I should let them know when I was coining to see them. Then they would have things a little more in order, and that would be pleasanter for you, and for them too, I should think.\" \" No doubt, if I went only for my own pleasure. But as they never know when I may make my appearance, the possibility of my coming when they least expect it acts upon them as a sort of check, for they know I scold if I find things very bad indeed. By degrees I hope they will drift into more orderly habits, and indeed I think I can see a sort of im provement already. They mind what I say better than they did.\" \" Yes, I can see you have great influence now; but how did you acquire it?\" *' By treating them like fellow-creatures, as equals in the eyes of God, some of them per haps our betters.

Oh, Caroline, what can he know about it ? \" \" Yes, a Catholic priest. A friend of the Dean's, who introduced him to me.\" Susan could not recover from her astonish ment. \" Mrs Tindal has a very bad opinion of Catholic priests,\" she said, at length. \" Has she ? Well, I think she would have a good opinion of my friend Mr Franklin, if she knew him. He lives at some distance, but comes over here occasionally. I met him once or twice in the cottage of one of his flock ; and the Dean, who had known him at Rome, brought him to my house. There are not many Catholics here, and they are all miserably poor, and as he knows I shall not attempt to tamper with their faith, he is only too glad to accept for them the trifling assistance I have it in my power to give.\" \" Oh, Caroline, how good you are ! Now I know why it is you are so much loved at Thornwood. There is not a cottage there that has not some memorial of your kindness to"], [78, "70 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. show. When baby is born, and Hubert and I go back there, you must come too.\" \" Baby's father, I am afraid, will say, No, to that.\" \" Ah, if you say that, you do not know him. Almost the only time he mentioned you he said how willingly he would be your friend, if you would but let him.\" Caroline was silent for some time, and when she spoke again it was with a slight tremor in her voice. \" He has indeed a noble heart,\" she said, \" and you do well to love him as you do.\" Almost the only intercourse which Susan still kept up with the world was through the medium of Lucy's letters, anxiously expected, but generally more productive of pain than pleasure. They were always filled with re monstrances against the plan of mysterious seclusion which her cousin had adopted, and entreaties that she would listen to reason, and abandon a course of life which none of her friends could approve. \" I do not often see Sir Hubert,\" she wrote in one of her com munications, \" and when I do your name is"], [79, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 71 never mentioned. He told me on one occasion that if I ever alluded to you, he never would set foot in my house again. He said he made no complaint against you, but that the subject was too painful for him to discuss. But, though he says nothing, I am certain, and so is John, that your present conduct adds to his displeasure, and I cannot blame him. It places you both in such an extraordinary position, and people will talk. Believe me, believe one who loves you dearly, that the best thing you can do is to leave your present re tirement, and take up your abode at Thorn wood. I am sure he would like it, and it will conduce to your present comfort and future happiness.\" Some tears Susan let fall as she read these words, but she was unmoved in her resolution. Vain were Caroline's representations that the advice was good ; that if she wished for a re conciliation with her husband, she ought to endeavour to meet his wishes as much as it was in her power to do ; that no place was so proper as Thornwood for the birth of Sir Hu bert Marston's son and heir, since son and"], [80, "72 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. heir it was to be. Susan clung to her little bit of romance ; all she answered was, \" Ah, but Lucy does not know, none of them know what we know ; \" till another thought struck her. \"Are you tired of me, Caroline? \u2014 do you wish to get rid of me ? \" she asked. Caroline was hurt, as well she might be, and as her answer showed. \" It is for your good, Susan, not for mine, that I give you this advice ; for when I lose you I shall feel very desolate. Do you think I can part with my sister without a bitter pang ! Do you think I can so easily forget all the ties which bind us ! If I thought only of myself I should say, ' Stay here for ever.' But this cannot be. You have duties which you must not neglect ; duties to your friends, to society, to your hus band, to your unborn child. Our separation, sooner or later, is inevitable. The only question is how to make it most conducive to your future welfare. We shall meet some times, I trust ; that you will not forget me, that you will continue to love me, I feel cer tain ; though if anything could make me doubt it, it would be the words you have just"], [81, "73 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. now used. I did not think you could have given utterance to so unkind a thought.\" Susan's penitence was as extreme and as vehement in its expression as all her other feelings, but she carried her point. She could not convince her sister-in-law of the soundness of her arguments, but she obtained from her a promise never to broach the subject of their separation again. The next event was a letter from Lord Deptford. \" How grieved, how deeply grieved I am, dearest Aunt Susan,\" he wrote, \"at the in formation I have just received from Hubert. He says he will not allow me to hear of your separation from any one bufhimself. Not,one word of blame does he utter against you, and he strictly forbids me to enquire into the cause. I obey, and will not even ask you for any explanations, but if I can be of any service, if you think that Hubert would listen to me, if, in short, I can do anything for you, you know that you may depend upon me thorough ly. Not being acquainted with the circum stances myself, it is for you to decide.\" He"], [82, "74 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. then went into an account of the expedition to the Dobrudscha, from which he had just returned, apparently in a state of great dis satisfaction, \u2014 but then he was fond of grum bling. According to him, the only result of their labours had been to bring back all the horses with sore backs. He concluded by begging Susan to give him her address, this letter having been sent under cover to Digby. Susan was deeply touched by the constant anxiety manifested by her husband to shield her from reproach. Her adoration for him returned in full force, and amounted almost to frenzy at the receipt of Lucy's next letter. \" Dearest Susan,\" it began, \" he is safe, quite safe ;\" and then the writer went on to give a full history of Sir Hubert's late excursion to Calais, and its result. She then continued, \" Of course, the world believes that Mr Pen rhys' piece of scandal about Mrs D. was the cause of the quarrel, but we know better ; he does not even know Mrs D. Was it not clever of him to take so good a pretext ! I suppose it is better as it is, but I confess I should have been better pleased, had he given"], [83, "75 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. that wicked man just a little lesson. I cannot see the good sense of standing still to be shot at by such a rascal as that, without doing something in return. John calls me all sorts of names for this, and says Sir Hubert's con duct was just what it ought to have been, that it is universally approved, and that Mr Pen rhys will stand w*orse than ever in the eyes of the world. Mr D., I am told, swears that he will cut his ears off. That is some consolation, certainly, but I cannot help my own feelings, and I know what I should have done in Sir Hubert's place. But then John says, ali women are cruel, and blood-thirsty, and re vengeful. Do not you pity me, my dear Susan, for having married a man who has such an opinion of us ? \" \" Oh, my good, my brave husband ! \" ex claimed Susan, after reading out this letter aloud to her friend. \" Ah, if that wretch had injured but a hair of his head, I would have revenged him myself. Is he not a man to be proud of!\" Caroline did not see it quite in the same light."], [84, "76 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Yes,\" she replied, \" he is all you say, good, brave, and a man to be proud of. But on the present occasion, he would have done better not to have broken the laws of God and man ; he should have left Mr Penrhys to the punishment of his own conscience.\" \" His conscience ! As if he had a conscience ! Where was his conscience, when for the last year he has been doing his best to work upon my insane feelings of jealousy ! He knew only too well what a fool, what an infatuated fool he had to deal with, and he took advantage of my blindness. He is a wicked, bad man, Caroline; but Hubert found him out long ago. Do you think then that he ought to have taken no notice of all Mr Penrhys' provocations and insults ?\" \"But, dearest,\" Caroline replied, \"what ever Mr Penrhys' offences may have been \u2014 and I am sure I have not the least wish to excuse them, for, like you, I believe him to be a bad man \u2014 in this particular instance, the insult came from Sir Hubert, with the evident intention of provoking a quarrel, and in this he was wrong.\""], [85, "77 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Susan's wrath was extreme. \" Ah, it is because you do not like him,\" she exclaimed, \"because you hate him, that you condemn him, and try to set me against him. You have no right to say to his wife that he was wrong in anything he did.\" Caroline by this time was pretty well accus tomed to her sister's vehement way of express ing herself. \" My dear Susan,\" she said, \" it is not so long since you w*ere indignant with me for loving him well enough to take his defence against you, and now you are indignant with me because you think I hate him. Let us understand each other, and settle which I am to do to please you \u2014 Love him, or not.\" \" Love him, love him, Caroline, for his own sake ; and for mine, please never say an unkind word against him. Remember, it was on my account that he risked his life.\" \" You may be sure, dearest, that I will never \u2014 intentionally, at least \u2014 say anything unkind of him, or of any one else, I hope. And I cannot admit that I have done so now. At all events, I have said nothing of him that"], [86, "78 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. I would not say to him, were he here present. I cannot call that right which I know to be wrong ; but men, in general, do not see these things in the same light that I do, and I can make every allowance for him. He has, no doubt, suffered great wrong at Mr Penrhys' hands, and the mercy which he showed his enemy when he had him in his power, will, I trust, go far to atone for his offence. It re minds me of the story of San Giovanni Gual berti. Did you ever hear it ? \" \" No, never. What is it ? \" \" He was a noble of Florence ; and his only brother, Hugo, having been murdered, he swore to avenge his death. Riding with his servant to Florence, on Good Friday, he met his enemy in a narrow road, from which there was no escape. The murderer flung himself from his horse, fell on his knees, and besought Gualberti to spare him, for the sake of our Blessed Lord, who, on that day, had given his life for the sins of the world. Affected by this appeal, Gualberti raised the suppliant from the ground, and embraced him, saying,"], [87, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 79 * I can refuse nothing that is asked of me for the sake of our dear Lord. I give you not only your life, but my friendship for ever. Pray for me, that God may pardon my sins.' He afterwards became a monk. That was a noble, a generous action, was it not ? \" \" It was. But Hubert's was more so ; for he spared, without solicitation, the enemy who had just endeavoured to take his life.\" It was no use arguing with her ; she had an answer for everything. \" And now,\" said Caroline, \" having your permission to love your husband, I will say that I love him so well, that I rejoice most sincerely that he has escaped the danger to which he exposed himself ; and still more, that he is free from the stain of blood, either his own or another's. Susan was not quite satisfied with this formula, but she very wisely abstained from any further discussion of the subject. She knew that, with all Caroline Marston's facility of disposition in matters of small importance, she was inflexible in her ideas of right and"], [88, "80 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. wrong. Experience had not been thrown away upon her. As for Susan herself, her conviction remained unshaken. Unconsciously, she adopted the doctrine of those accommodat ing theologians, who hold that it is a most pernicious error to distinguish sins according to the fact, not according to the person. Hu bert must be right in all he did, though it might be wrong in others to act in the same way. Days and weeks passed away. They wrere now in the last days of August, and Dr Baird had fixed the middle of October as the pro bable time of Susan's confinement. It was now* that she regretted her want of skill with the needle. She worked hard at the trousseau of the young gentleman presumptive, but in those particular articles of baby-apparel, which required delicate manipulation, she was not as successful as her zeal and good-will deserved. They were generally turned over to Caroline for the finishing touches, though it sorely tried her equanimity. \" I should so like,\" she said, \" to make everything for him myself.\""], [89, "81 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. ' You do not, surely, grudge me doing a little work for my nephew,\" Caroline replied. \" Your nephew* ! So he will be. I never thought of that. Thank God, if I die, there will be some one to love him. You must be his mother, Caroline.\" \" I should always love your child, Susan, even if he were not my nephew. No need to talk of your dying to insure that. The chances are that you will out-live me, though, I trust, we have both of us long and happy days before us.\" \" Who knows ; who can tell ! I hope so ; and, if all goes well, we shall all pass Christmas together at Thornwood. By December, at latest, I shall be able to take baby to his father, and when I tell him all you have been to me, all you have done for me, he, too, will love you as I do. I wonder where he wall be then. In London, I hope.\" Caroline said nothing, but there was a touch of melancholy in the smile with which she listened to her sister-in-law's plans, though she little foresaw how soon her planning would be brought to nought. VOL. III. 6"], [90, "82 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. They lived so little in the world, and cared so little for its doings, that they were quite content to get the Times on the second day. It was on the morning following this convers ation, while Caroline Marston was reading some letters which she had just received, that she was startled by a cry of agony from Susan, who had possessed herself of the paper. \" What is it, Susan ? \" she exclaimed, start ing up, and hastening to her. \" He is gone, gone without one word \u2014 -one little word, to soften the bitterness of this lost hope. Oh, now I know he no longer loves me. That was, indeed, a last parting. I feel I shall never, in this world, see him again.\" Caroline took up the paper which her sister in-law had let fall, and soon found the para graph which had so deeply moved her. It was ship-news from Southampton, and ran thus : \u2014 \" Yesterday, the Eliza sailed with passen gers, and a detachment of troops for Varna."], [91, "83 SIR HUBERT MARSTON.

The intelligence was perfectly correct. Sir Hubert Marston had taken his departure for the East, with the intention of joining the army. It was no sudden or hasty resolution,. but one adopted after mature deliberation ; and to this step many reasons concurred in urging him. Accustomed to a life of action, he was utterly weary of the tranquil and pur poseless existence which he had been leading for the last two years, deprived as he now wras of the society of one who would have relieved it of its monotonous insipidity. He had been very fond of the profession which he had quitted so abruptly ; and now that there was a chance of seeing active service against an"], [93, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 85 European foe for the first time for forty years, he found it difficult to resist the temptation of sharing the glories, and, it might be, the dangers, of his old companions, though only as an amateur. All this was much, but the real, or, at all events, the most cogent reason of all was to be found in the state of his re lations with Susan. With the conviction that they were separated for ever, he was miserable without her. The sentence that parted them had come from his lips ; and though he re peated to himself that, after her conduct and injurious language, nothing should tempt him to recall it, he felt himself aggrieved by her making no effort to appease his anger, now, too, that she must be convinced how unfounded her charges against him had been. True, the terms he had used were such as to preclude all hopes of reconciliation ; but, had she loved him as he once fancied she did, she would not have submitted so patiently to her fate. At least, she might have sent him one line confessing her error. To this must be added the natural irritation he felt at her persisting in keeping the place of her abode concealed,"], [94, "86 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. and in refusing all his offers of assistance. She ought to have seen in them, not only his anxiety to contribute to her welfare, but his wish to give their separation as amicable a character as possible. She ought to have accepted his proposal to reside at Thornwood. That would have proved to the world that, though living apart, their estrangement had nothing of a hostile nature in it. There, she might still, with perfect propriety, have re- ceived her friends and his own ; she would have been in her proper position as the wife of Sir Hubert Marston, and might have set at defiance the ill-natured comments of the world. All this she pertinaciously rejected ; and he could only see in this conduct a de- termination to accept their separation as an accomplished fact, never to be rescinded. There were times when, thinking over all that had occurred in the past year, he almost per suaded himself that, in telling her that he would never see her again, he had only an ticipated her wishes, and that she was re joicing in her emancipation from ties which had become hateful to her. He was almost"], [95, "87 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. tempted to accuse her of duplicity, and this thought greatly aggravated his displeasure, but it also made him still more unhappy. Without taking counsel of any one, he deter mined to seek relief for his troubles in far distant and more stirring scenes. He ran down to Thornwood for a couple of days, announced to his servants that he was going abroad for a few months, but that it was not his intention to make any change in his establishment. It was not improbable, he said, that Lady Marston might come there before long, in which case her orders on every point were to be obeyed as his own. He only passed one night in London on his return, and then, without a word to any one, went down to Southampton, taking with him only a lad out of the stables, the son of one of the Thornwood gardeners. Before embarking, he wrote at great length to Digby, to whom he committed the entire management of his affairs during his absence. The only reason he gave for his departure was that he was tired of leading an inactive life. \" I know,\" he went on to say, \" that you will all be furious with me, and it is"], [96, "88 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. this feeling that has prevented my saying good bye to all those who are dear to me. I should have been overwhelmed with remonstrances, to which I could not have listened, and there fore I adopted this plan, to avoid the pain of saying No. And now I want your dear Lucy to execute a commission for me, and as nearly as possible in the words in which I give it. I wish her to write to Lady Marston, to tell her of my leaving England for some months. It is my intention to join the English army in Turkey, and the time of my return will naturally depend much upon the progress of events there. I wish to assure her that it is from no want of respect to her, or disregard of her feelings, that I have not myself informed her of my intentions, but as all direct com munication between us has long ceased, as I am even ignorant of her present place of abode, and as no doubt my proceedings are a matter of indifference to her, I shrink from taking a step which she might deem intrusive. I wish also to reiterate to her, though with small hopes of success, my most earnest request that she will make Thornwood her residence, at"], [97, "89 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. least during my absence. I have announced to the servants there the possibility of her re turn, instructing them to obey her orders in everything. There she can see whom she pleases, receive whom she pleases, and in short act in every way as absolute and uncontrolled mistress. Should anything happen to me, she will see by the dispositions of my will that I knew how to appreciate her worth. My great, my lasting regret is, that I should have taken advantage of her youth and inexperience, to induce her to join her fate to that of one evidently so little suited to her as myself. Former experience ought to have made me wiser. My only excuse is that I thought I could make her happy, and God is my witness I would have done so, had I known how.\" Before this letter reached Digby, the writer had sailed. Those only can enter into Susan's feelings who have known what it is to be deprived of hopes long indulged, hopes wdiich had grown more buoyant from day to day, to be destroyed on the eve of their seeming realization. She fell at once into a state of utter prostration"], [98, "90 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. and despair, rejecting impatiently all Caroline's well-meant attempts at consolation, and pas sionately exclaiming, whenever her tears would allow her to speak, that her only wish was to die ; that perhaps Hubert might think more kindly of her dead than he did of her while living. Her sister-in-law at length grew so much alarmed that in the evening she thought it advisable to send for Dr Baird, instructing him to come in] by the back door, and send for her to the housekeeper's room. When he arrived, she told him as much of the truth as it was necessary for him to know. \" The fact is,\" she said, \" she has just heard that her husband has gone to join the army, without taking leave of her, or even sending her a line of farewell.\" \" What a heartless brute the man must be!\" exclaimed the doctor. \" To abandon that beautiful, young creature so near her time.\" \" Hush, hush, Doctor. He does not know her situation. He is a very proud, determined man, but he is not so much to blame. It was a foolish quarrel at first, and Susan, poor child, feels that she was greatly in fault. It"], [99, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 91 is that which makes her so miserable, for she is passionately in love with him ; and if you speak of him to her as you have just now done to me, I will hardly answer for the conse quences. But something must be done. She hasbeen almost inhysterics the whole morning.\" \" I will put a stop to that at once. Let me see her.\" \" I am almost afraid she will refuse. I have lost all power over her.\" In this Lady Marston was not far wrong. When she returned to the drawing-room ac companied by Dr Baird, and announced him, Susan started up and tried to leave the room, saying\u2014 \" I will not see him, I will not see any one. How could you be so cruel, Caroline ! \" But the Doctor laid hands on her before she could make her escape. \" I am come to see you and to talk to you, Mrs Hubert,\" he said, in his quiet, firm man ner, \" and I will not go without it.\" He led her back unresisting to the sofa, and seated himself beside her. \"And now tell me, my dear, what it is all"], [100, "92 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. about. If you go on in this way you will kill yourself. Perhaps you will say, that is no business of mine ; but you will also kill your child. That is my business, and I cannot allow it.\" Susan burst into a passion of tears. \" Oh, my child, my poor, fatherless child ! \" \" Nonsense, my dear madam, you are not a widow yet. Many go to the wars, and come back safe, and so will Captain Hubert, too, I have no doubt.\" He bestow*ed this rank on the mysterious individual in question at a venture. \" Ah, you do not know, Doctor \u2014 \" No, and I do not want to know. All I do know is that, if you do not behave better, I shall be obliged to make a very bad report of you to your husband, when he does return.\" \" If he ever does return, he will be only too ready to believe you.\" \" The more reason for you to keep on good terms with me, and bribe me into telling him all the good I think of you. And as for his returning, I have prophesied that he will, and"], [101, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 93 I think it very uncivil in you not to believe me.

We are only intended to act as scarecrows, to frighten the Russian crows from the Turkish corn. I hope Captain Hubert is a very ugly man ; it will have a much greater effect if he is. Susan could not refrain from a smile. \" But do you really think,\" she asked, \" that there will be no war \u2014 no fighting war, I mean ? \" \"I do, indeed; or at least, that it will be confined to the navy.\" And so thought many others even at that time. Dr Baird was satisfied with the effect he had produced, and prepared to take his leave, signifying his intention to send some com posing draughts, which Susan consented to take. He also extracted from her a promise to go to bed at once, and endeavour to keep her mind as much at ease as possible. \" I"], [102, "94 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. assure you,\" he said, \" all this agitation is very detrimental to the young gentleman we are expecting.\" The composing draughts arrived, and were swallowed with proper submission. They had no doubt a very salutary effect, but the Doctor's composing words had a still greater. The healing art is not confined to the dispensing of drugs. Owing to the circuitous nature of her postal communications, it was not till the evening of the following day that Susan received Lucy Digby's letter, and when it did arrive the first impression it produced was one of pain and disappointment ; pain at being reduced to the humiliation of receiving information of her husband's movements through a third person ; disappointment at the cold formality in which she was mentioned by him, whilst sending her what he evidently thought might be a last farewell.

She is much more experienced in such matters than I am.\" \" I love Lucy dearly, but she is not to me, nobody ever can be to me, what you are. Besides, I have no confidence in any one but Dr Baird. Do not send me away, Caroline. I want yours to be the first face baby will look upon.\" \" My love,\" said Caroline, \" no one wants to send you away. As you attach so much importance to it, you shall stay here with me, and Dr Baird to attend you. We will have the first sight of baby all to ourselves, but it must be upon the condition that, when you are able to move, you will comply with your husband's wishes. You will be confined to wards the end of October, so the Doctor thinks, and in six weeks afterwards, if things go well, you can go to Thornwood, in time to pass your Christmas there. Will this plan suit you ? \""], [105, "97 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" I suppose it must. But what shall I do without you ! \" The result of this discussion was, that Susan wrote to her cousin, and begged her to inform Sir Hubert that, in compliance with his wishes, she would return to Thornwood before the end of the year, but that the arrangements she had already made would not allow her to think of moving before December. \" And then, dear Lucy,\" she continued, \" you and Mr Digby must come down with me. I shall pass through London on my way, and call for you. Remember, I will take no denial.\" She was not long left in the blissful delusion that the war would not be a fighting war, to use her own expression. News had arrived that the invasion of the Crimea had been finally decided, and again Susan was thrown into despair by the ignorance in which she was left of her husband's proceedings, and the seeming impossibility of obtaining any direct information respecting them. In this emer gency she bethought her of Lord Deptford. \" Deptford, dear Deptford,\" she wrote, \" if VOL. III. 7"], [106, "98 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. indeed you do feel for me the affection you have so often professed, now is the time to show it. Hubert has left England to join the army. He only sent me a message before he went, but did not write to me himself. I had no right to expect that he would. I do not deserve that he should waste a thought on me, but the agony of suspense to which his silence condemns me is more than I can bear. I do not complain of it, for it is the just punish ment of my wicked conduct ; but, dear Dept ford, it will kill me if it continues much longer. My only hope is in you ; that whenever you can you will write me one line \u2014 I ask no more \u2014 to tell me that he is safe and well. Address your letter to the care of the Dean of Newport ; and above all do not breathe a word of this letter to Hubert. I put it upon your honour to keep my secret. Perhaps he would be offended.

I need not tell you to watch over him and take care of his safety.\" She did not explain how a captain of"], [107, "99 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Hussars was to watch over the safety of a volunteer in the Guards. Fortune threw in her way the means of securing another correspondent. She and Caroline were returning home from a walk, when they suddenly came upon a soldier evidently trying to comfort a young woman, who lay sobbing in his arms. To their en quiries if they could be of any use, the man replied, that he was one of a detachment under orders for Turkey, \u2014 that the young woman was his wife, whom he had brought with him to Highbeach, her native place, where she was to remain during his absence. \" We thought,\" he said, \" she would do better, and get employment here, where she has friends, than in London, for she is main handy with her needle. So we were saying good-bye ; for I only got leave of absence for a few hours, just to settle her, and my time is up.

The sergeant was obtuse. \" Why, what have I done now, Mary ? \" he asked. \" Never mind,\" said Susan, blushing. \" Did you know Sir Hubert Marston, who was once in your regiment ? \" \" Captain Marston, I knew, Miss. A fine, tall, powerful young man, and a capital shot with the rifle, I remember. I did not know much of him myself, howsomever, for he left us soon after I joined.\" \"Yes, that is the one I mean.

You are my command ing officer in this here matter, and I promise to obey orders. My name, it is Sergeant Clarke.\" \" Now, Mrs Clarke, come up to-morrow to Ivy Cottage, and ask for Mrs Hubert. In the mean time, take this. I dare say there is some little thing you will like to get for your husband.\" She put two sovereigns into Mary's hand."], [110, "102 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. She had not many, but how could they be better employed than in obtaining news of Hubert ! Unborn, and happily unconscious, baby was the sufferer. The purchase of a cap, which Susan was dying to get for him, was adjourned sine die. Caroline Marston, with her usual consider ate kindness, had ordered the Times to be sent from London by the earliest train ; and of all the readers of Mr Russell's graphic sketches, there was no one by whom they were devoured with greater avidity than by Susan Marston. The frightful accounts of the devastation caused by the cholera filled her with terror ; the non arrival of letters made her feel certain that some dreadful disaster had occurred at sea, for weeks elapsed without bringing her a line in answer to her letter to Lord Deptford. Mrs Clarke was without any news from her husband, but she took it much more quietly, and, being of a mathematical turn of mind, had ascertained that it was impossible she could hear from him for a week or ten days. Lucy had written to say that Digby had heard from Sir Hubert from Malta, but simply on"], [111, "103 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. matters of business ; they were to sail for Varna on the following day. Then came the news of preparations for embarking the troops, and Susan's excitement became something frightful to witness. She could settle to no thing ; she wandered about the house from one room to the other, without ceasing and without purpose. She hurried down to Mrs Clarke's abode at all hours, overwhelming her with questions as to the earliest possible time at which she could hear from the Sergeant, all of which that good-natured individual an swered with perfect composure, and generally in the same form of words ; but, though pa tient under the infliction, she began to doubt whether she had made as advantageous a bargain as she had at first supposed. Twenty times a day Susan exclaimed, \" Ah, if Deptford would but write one line ! He used to say he loved me, and now he abandons me. I did not think he could be so cruel.\" In vain Caroline represented that, either he had not yet received her letter, or, what was more probable, that Sir Hubert had not yet"], [112, "104 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. arrived, and that he was waiting to see him before writing. At such a moment, too, he must necessarily have much to attend to, and perhaps could not find time. These suggestions were of no avail. \" I only asked for one line. Everybody can find time to write one line. Can you not see, Caroline, that if anything happens to Hubert, I shall be his murderer? I have driven him to this. I snail have killed my husband \u2014 my husband, for whom I would lay down my life this moment, and who, but for me, would now be in peace and safety at home.\" \"Dearest Susan,\" said Caroline, soothingly, \" God know*s I feel for you \u2022 but you must not give way to such thoughts as these. No doubt, your mistrust of your husband's truth was the original cause of your separation. But the act itself was his. He might have been more lenient, and made more allowance for your excitable nature, for appearances cer tainly were against him. He might have for given language wrung from you \u2014 \""], [113, "105 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" No, no,\" burst in Susan. \" I should have despised him for ever if he had.\" \" Well, at all events, as I said just now*, right or wrong, the actual separation was his own doing \u2022 and no reasonable being can hold you responsible for the consequences of his own act. But I cannot take so gloomy a view of tilings as you do. Sir Hubert's destiny is in the hands of God as much as ours. It is His to slay and to spare ; and the peaceful citizen at his own fireside cannot feel certain of seeing another sunrise, more than he over whom the sword is lifted in battle. My own conviction is, that your husband will return to you safe and unhurt. Remember Dr Baird \u2014 \" The allusion to Dr Baird was unfortunate. That learned gentleman did not happen to stand high in Susan's favour at that moment. \"Dr Baird!\" she exclaimed. \"How can you talk of Dr Baird ! He told me there would be no fighting, and you see what it has come to, with his stupid jokes about scare crows. I shall never believe a word Dr Baird"], [114, "106 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. says again. I hate the sound of his name.\" The scarecrow joke had rather amused her at the time; now she looked upon it as a great liberty and piece of impertinence. \" Susan, Susan, will you never learn to ex ercise a little self-control ! If you knew the pain it gives me to hear you use such violent language, you would try to check yourself.\" \" Yes, yes, you are right ; but I did not mean what I said. I know Dr Baird said it in kindness, but he ought not to have deceived me, and treated me like a child. He might have known that when I came to know the truth, it would be all the harder to bear.\" \" My dear Susan, if you knew Dr Baird as well as I do, you would feel certain that no earthly consideration would tempt him to utter a syllable, that he did not believe to be strictly true. When he said there would be no fighting, I am quite certain he believed it. As for treating you like a child, it is what I am very much inclined to do myself, and send you to bed without supper.\" \" Do, do, if you like, but only say you for give me first ; and you know I really do like"], [115, "107 SIR HUBERT MARSTON.

Then a few days later came the information that the Eliza had appeared in the offing, with three hundred men on board belonging to different regiments ; all well. She had immediately been ordered by signal to join the fleet without coming into port. \"And not a word of Hubert!\" exclaimed Susan, throwing down the paper in disgust. \" That proves,\" Caroline observed, \" that he is included in the * all well.' \" At length it was known that the army was to disembark at Eupatoria, and that in all probability their landing would be opposed by the Russians.

Some few there were, no doubt, whose widowed hearts felt this addition to our glory all too dearly purchased by the life-blood of a husband, a son, or a lover.

As soon as she had read through Lord Raglan's dispatch, and carefully examined the lists of the killed and wounded, she hurried off to hold a con sultation with her ally, Mrs Clarke ; but from her she derived small comfort. It was pretty clear that the transport, on board which the sergeant had sailed, could not as yet have reached the Crimea, and no intelligence there fore was to be expected from his wife.

But before he could answer, Caroline made her appearance, with an open letter in her hand. \" I bring you good news, dearest,\" she said. \" I have just heard from the Dean. He de sires me to tell you that as soon as the news of the battle arrived, he went off at once to the War Office, where Mr Crossby, a cousin of his, is high in office, and asked him if there was any news of Sir Hu \u2014 \" she stopped short, noticing the Doctor for the first time. \"Go on, Caroline,\" cried Susan. \"You may go on. I have told him my husband is Sir Hubert Marston.\" \" I am delighted to hear it. He is every way worthy of your confidence.

Mr Crossby had himself met Sir Hu bert once or twice at dinner at the Colonel's. In short, the Dean thinks there can be no doubt of his safety, if, indeed, he was in the action at all, which is doubtful.\" \" Thank God, thank God, indeed ! \" said Susan, her eyes brightening. \" Of course, he is a friend of Colonel Manning. How stupid of me to forget it ! \" The Doctor seemed a little fidgetty. \" Will you allow me to ask, Lady Mar ston \u2014 \" \" Mrs Hubert. I am nothing but Mrs Hubert now. Caroline is the only Lady Marston here. You will keep my secret, Doctor ? \" \"Faithfully, though you will permit me to say I regret the necessity for it, if necessity there is.

They are very foolish things in general. However, it is no busi ness of mine.\" Still eight-and-forty hours of anxious hopes and doubts, and then arrived the long-expected letter from Lord Deptford, thoroughly char acteristic of the writer.

And first, I must explain that I only received your letter while we were in the act of embarking, and la, my dear, you might have knocked me down with a feather, when I heard Hubert was coming out ; for, what with the cholera and other delicacies VOL. III. 8"], [122, "114 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. of the season, we have had a bad time of it, though we are doing better now. I would not write to you till I had seen Hubert, and that only occurred last night. Of the fitt itself, as my sergeant-major calls it, I will tell you nothing, for you will see all about it in the papers. Hubert was in the thick of it, and came out of it untouched. Between you and me, I believe he won the battle. For when a Russian battery was pitching shot and shell into our fellows as fast as they could, Hubert picked off the gunners with his rifle, like so many crows, till they were obliged to limber up and beat a retreat. I should not wonder if the papers - said that was owing to two of our guns which opened on them, but don't you believe it. Hubert did it all. As for us, we had nothing to do but to look on. Ah, my dear aunt, the government is in bad hands. If they had but had the nous (I would spell it for you in Greek, but have forgotten how) to give the command of the cavalry to Captain, Lord Deptford,* I think he would have as tonished their weak minds not a little. Such splendid opportunities lost ! It really looks"], [123, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 115 as if we were sent out merely for ornament. Seriously, if this sort of fun is to continue, I shall exchange into the line. Well now, fancy the battle over, and your devoted nephew wandering about in search of uncle Hubert. Oh, dear aunt Susan, that walk last night ought to cure me of laughing and jesting for the rest of my days . No one, who has not seen a field of battle when all is over, can form the slightest idea of its horrors. It is the most terrible, the most appalling of sights. Literally mounds of dead and dying ; men groaning in their agony, and imploring assistance, which one is powerless to give. But I will not grow sentimental ; it might lead me too far. Well, after a long search and enquiries innumerable, I found Hubert placidly smoking the cigar of indolence, and watching the operations of his servant, who under his directions was erecting a small tent he had brought with him, and very comfortable we found it, I cau tell you. He is looking uncommonly well, though as brown as a gipsy. I need not say that we were delighted to meet. He asked me no end of questions as to how I knew he had joined,"], [124, "116 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. how I had found him out, &c, some of which I found it difficult to parry, as you had so strictly forbidden me to say that you had ap pointed me his guardian. You may be sure I will do my best to discharge my duties as such to your satisfaction, but I am afraid, belonging to such different branches of the service, I shall never see much of him till the day's work is over. I suppose I am peculiarly adapted for looking after husbands, for Fanny, in her last letter, tells me that her sister, Mrs Fleming, depends upon me for taking care of Fleming. This will be easier, as he is in my own regi ment. I wonder if they have had the grace to tell Fleming to take care of me. They say there was a bevy of Russian ladies with Menschikoff, who had come from Sebastopol to see the English and French driven into the sea ! I wish I could have bagged one of them, to send Fanny as a lady's maid. By the by, do you recollect your little groom Dick ? He is the only servant Hubert has brought with him. I cannot help thinking that he owes this very questionable favour to his having been a protege of yours. The poor little fellow found"], [125, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 117 an opportunity of whispering to me, that he hoped My Lady was quite well when I last heard. How on earth could he have guessed that we were in correspondence ? What volumes I have written, and I have yet to write to Fanny and my mother, but I was de termined my first letter should be to dear aunt Susan. My next will, no doubt, be from Sebastopol. We shall just walk into it with as much ease and as little ceremony as I used to do into your house in London. I have formed a capital plan. I mean to take the best palace in the place, and you and Fanny shall come out to me and do the honours of it. We will give dinners, balls, masquerades, any thing you will, regardless of expense; and unless Hubert behaves properly he shall not get an invitation. And so, dearest aunt Susan, adieu. God bless you. Let me hear from you again soon. \" Ever your affectionate nephew, D.\" \" P. S. \u2014 Colonel Manning has just told me that Hubert has been pressed to take a com mission, with a promise of as speedy promotion as the rules of the service will allow, and that"], [126, "118 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. he has declined. Looks well for home-pro spects, I should say.\" \"That I call a satisfactory letter,\" said Caroline, when she had heard it read. \" Such a correspondent ought to be encouraged. I hope you mean to write to him again soon.\" This piece of advice was superfluous. Su san had not the slightest intention of allowing the correspondence to drop, especially as there was a sentence in his letter which had engendered a most brilliant idea in her mind, requiring however his co-operation. It was that in which, while lamenting the inactivity of the cavalry, he had suggested the proba bility that they had been sent out merely for ornament. Susan was not profoundly versed in military matters, and she jumped at the con clusion that Lord Deptford had hit upon the truth. If cavalry had really been required, of course those tall, powerful life-guardsmen would have been sent out. They were big enough and strong enough to cut their way through anything, but what general would have the heart to send those slight, delicate looking hussars and lancers into a melee, where"], [127, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 119 they would be chopped into minced meat, and their splendid uniforms cut to rags ! Perhaps they might occasionally be called upon to chase a flying foe, but in this there could be no great danger. If only Hubert could be enticed into joining them, he would enjoy all the excitement and participate in all the glories of the war, without sharing its dangers. It did not so much matter certainly, as probably Sebastopol w*as by that time in the hands of the allies, but still it was worth a trial. Fraught with this idea, which, however, she communicated to no one, she sat down to in dite what she considered to be a most artfully constructed epistle to her secret agent. She began by thanking him warmly for the long and delightful letter he had found time to write to her, and more especially for all he had told her about her husband. Then she ex pressed her regret that their different duties should prevent their seeing more of each other. \" How much more comfortable it would be for both of you,\" she went on to say, \" if you belonged to the same regiment. Of course, as Hubert is only a volunteer, he is at liberty"], [128, "120 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. to attach himself to any regiment he prefers. Do not you think you could persuade him to give up the Guards and join you. If you were either of you ill, only think how it would relieve the anxiety of all your friends at home, if we knew that you had some one, upon whom we could depend, to nurse you and look after you. Dear Deptford, I have set my heart upon this. Do try to manage it for me. By your account, you and Hubert might as well be serving in two different armies. I am sorry Hubert has taken Dick with him ; he is too young for such rough work. I always liked that boy, and it is pleasant to find that one is not forgotten by those one likes. Give him my kind regards, and tell him I hope he will serve his master with as much care and attention as he served me. I will send him a silver watch by the first opportunity, or if such an article is to be found in your part of the world, I wish you would buy it for me, and give it him in my name. Mind, this a com mission, so let me know what it costs, and do not ruin me, for I am not rich just now. In your next I expect to hear that you are in"], [129, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 121 Sebastopol, and that Hubert has joined your troop. I am afraid I must decline your in vitation. I have promised to return to Thorn wood before Christmas. Hubert wishes it.

As soon as I received your letter I bought a watch for him, which had belonged to a sergeant of the light division, killed in the trenches. I gave it him with your message four days ago, and his cheeks crimsoned with pleasure, while he begged me to thank you for your kindness. Now he is dead, after a few hours' illness. I do not think he suffered much, and Hubert tended him as if he had been a son of his own, giving up his own bed to him. I never saw him so much moved. He flung himself upon his knees by the bedside, and entreated"], [130, "122 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. the poor lad's forgiveness for having brought him away from home to die. ' Please, Sir Hubert, please don't,' he replied. ' You've always been a kind master to me and all of us.' Hubert asked him if there was any thing he wished done. * I should like, Sir Hubert,' he said, 'to send the watch My Lady gave me to father, and some things in my box to mother and the rest of them.' Of course Hubert promised to send it all to England, and assured him that as long as he lived his family should never want. ' Thank you, Sir Hubert, for all your kindness, and please give my humble duty to My Lady.' They were his last words. Ah, Susan, you win all hearts. That poor boy loved you, and carried his love for you to the grave. You know how calm and composed Hubert is. It was not so now. He cried like a child as he stooped down to kiss the inani mate forehead, and I am not ashamed to say I followed his example. ' Ah, my God,' he exclaimed, ' how shall I answer for that boy's death to his father and mother ! I shall be afraid to look them in the face.' Dick was"], [131, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 123 buried this morning, for we make quick w*ork of it out here, and then we proceeded to examine his box. Such a medley you never saw. A great coat, a foraging cap, a bayonet, a broken sword, fragments of shells, and Minie bullets, all ticketed with the names of relations or friends. And last, but not least, a huge bear skin cap, labelled ' For Baby.' But it would be a sin to cast a shade of ridicule on that exceedingly rare virtue, family affection. I can fancy how the poor lad chuckled when he fastened on the label. Of our doings I have nothing to tell. We might have taken Sebastopol by a coup de main, and would not ; and now we are in for a regular siege, which may last for months. I offered Hubert a shilling as bounty-money to enlist in my troop, but he refused. 'What can light cavalry do against stone-walls and mounds of earth ?' he said ; and he is right. He is quite well in health, but I think a little out of spirits, as is the case with many others.

My belief is we should have taken the whole Rus sian army prisoners, with Menschikoff at their head. Remember how the French mopped up the Prussians after Jena.\" \" Tempora rnutantur, nos et mutamur in Mis,\" said the uncle, sententiously, helping his visitor to the wing of a goose. \" If the Guards are changed, we are not"], [135, "127 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. I promise you,\" retorted the nephew, rather warmly. At that moment a well-known trumpet-call rang out shrill and clear through the morning air. \"By Jove, Boots and saddles!\" ex claimed Lord Deptford, jumping up. \"What is that about, I wonder ? \" While he was yet speaking, his servant galloped up on his charger. \" If you please, my Lord,\" said the man, \" you have no time to lose. Our men are getting into their sad dles as fast as they can. They say Sir Colin Campbell has sent up word that the Russians are advancing in force, and have already at tacked the Turkish redoubts. And if you please, Sir Hubert, as I passed the Guards' camp, I saw they were getting under arms.\" \"Now, old fellow,\" said Lord Deptford, lighting a cigar, and grasping his uncle's hand, \" if they give us a chance, you shall see we are not the milksops you all take us to be.\" \" God bless you, dear Deptford. To an other I might say do your duty like a brave man ; to you I will only say do not be fool hardy. Remember those at home.\""], [136, "128 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. By this time Lord Deptford was mounted. \" I shall expect you to supper to talk it all over,\" said Sir Hubert. \" All right,\" shouted out his nephew as he galloped off. \" Have that goose deviled.\" Marston took his rifle and revolver, and Avalked off at a swift pace to the ground occu pied by his regiment, taking his place, as he was in the habit of doing by permission of the Colonel, on the right of the line. So com pletely w*as he considered one of themselves, that Colonel Manning, either in joke or from forgetfulness, said to him with the utmost gravity, and in a tone of reprimand, \" You are late on parade this morning, Sir Hubert,\" to which Marston humbly replied, \" I beg your pardon, Colonel, but I came as soon as I heard the regiment was turning out.\" \" Well,\" said Manning, with a smile, \" as it is the first time I suppose I must overlook it.\" For some time the men of the first division were mere spectators of the brilliant feats of arms that day enacted. They saw the 93rd, drawn up in a line, calmly await and baffle by one well-directed volley the desperate charge"], [137, "129 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. of 3500 horsemen. They saw the Greys and Enniskillens, supported by the 4th and 5th Dragoon Guards, ride down and scatter like chaff a force of cavalry at least double their own in number. \" Poor Deptford ! \" whispered Marston to Colonel Manning, who happened to be near him at the time. \" He will be furious. That unfortunate light brigadewill be shelved again.\" Soon afterwards, the brigade of Guards was ordered to place itself at the disposal of Sir Colin Campbell, and was marched down to the extreme right, opposite the redoubts from which our excellent friends the Turks, for whom we were spending millions upon millions, and lavishing the best blood of our sons, had fled very early in the day, with scarcely an attempt at defence. From these redoubts the Russians kept up for some time an irregular fire on the troops opposed to them, but with out inflicting much loss. As the allied army advanced the enemy retired, and with this the French and English commanders were satisfied. They had no w-ish to bring on a general action from which there was nothing to be gained. VOL. III. 9"], [138, "130 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. During all this time the Guards remained in position to cover the road to Balaklava. It was late before they were marched back to their own camp. * Of what had been going on in other parts of the field they saw and heard but little. A report reached them that the light cavalry brigade had charged and taken one of the Russian batteries, and had been forced to re tire with considerable loss. Of the particulars they could learn nothing. It was with anxious forebodings that Marston took his way at once to the Cavalry camp, and before he reached it his worst fears were confirmed. Jenkins, Lord Deptford's servant, met him on the road, and in great agitation told him that neither his Lordship nor his horse had returned, that he had been one of the first to enter the bat tery, that two or three of his men were certain that they had seen him leave it, but in the confusion they had lost sight of him, and could * The military details in this and other chapters are taken almost exclusively from Mr Russell's excellent and lucid work, The British Expedition to the Crimea."], [139, "131 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. not say whether he was killed, or wounded, or a prisoner. One man, a corporal in his own troop, said that he had seen Lord Deptford half-way down the valley on the retreat, and that his horse did not go very freely, as if it had been wounded. Marston engaged two or three soldiers and Jenkins to accompany him, and then returning to his own tent, ordered his Maltese servant to bring a blanket and lantern \u2014 for it was now dark \u2014 -and follow him. But that worthy had no fancy for nocturnal expeditions, and flatly refused. He chose his time ill, however, for this piece of insubordina tion : his master dismissed him on the spot, and kicked him out of his tent. With Jenkins and the soldiers Marston now commenced his investigations, examining with care every mangled body \u2014 and there were many \u2014 that lay in his path. They had nearly reached the spot at which the corporal, who was one of the party, averred that he had last seen his captain. Lights on the neighbouring heights showed that they were in very unpleasant vicinity to the enemy, and Marston was beginning to"], [140, "132 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. think that his search would be in vain, when he heard a faint voice, a little to the right of wrhere he stood, pronounce his name. \" Deptford ! \" he exclaimed, turning to the spot, \" is that you ? \" It was indeed. Lord Deptford, evidently in great pain, was lying on the ground beneath his dead charger, unable to help himself, hardly able to speak. \" I knew you would come for me, Hubert,\" he murmured out. With the assistance of his companions, Marston contrived to extricate him, and laid him gently in the blanket, though the groans which escaped him during the operation suf ficiently proved the agony he was in. The men raised the blanket with great care and gentleness, and commenced their journey back to the camp, his uncle walking by his side and holding his hand. It was not till they were fairly under way, that Marston asked him if he thought he was seriously hurt. \" To death, uncle. I have fought my first and last fight.\" From that time he never ad dressed Sir Hubert except as uncle. It seemed"], [141, "133 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. as if he thought that the tie of relationship drew still closer the bonds of affection which united them. \" Oh, my dear, dear Deptford, I hope, I trust in God you are mistaken.\" Lord Deptford made no answer. As they w*ere approaching the camp, he said \u2014 \" Take me to your tent, uncle.\" Jenkins was sent on before to summon the surgeon, whom, on their arrival, they found in attendance. Lord Deptford was laid on Mar ston's small camp-bed, and after a short ex amination, the surgeon saw that the case was hopeless. He had received two bullets in his body, and a wound from a lance, which in itself was mortal. By his own account, he had been speared by a Cossack, as he lay struggling on the ground. While the surgeon was applying a hasty dressing to the wounds, Lord Deptford said, \" You need not tell me I am dying, Hawkins. I see it in your face \u2022 but indeed I knew it before, as I told my uncle. Thank God, I feel less pain now. When will it be ? I am not afraid to die, and it would be real cruelty not to tell me that.\""], [142, "134 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Would to God, my Lord,\" said Hawkins, \" I could hold out any hope, but I grieve to say that you have judged your state correctly. There is no very immediate danger of death, but I fear you will not live through another day.\" \"Thank you, Hawkins. This is not the first, though it is the best, proof of friendship you have given me. As there is nothing to be done for me, you had better go to those to whom you can be of use. I fear you have but too many. Is Fleming safe? \" \" Captain Fleming is wounded in the leg, but not severely.\" \" Thank God for that. Tell him\u2014 but no, never mind. Give my love to him and all my brother-officers, and tell them I thank them from the bottom of my heart for the invariable kindness and friendship I have experienced from every one of them, since I joined the regiment. I am thankful that I was permitted to share in the glory it has this day acquired. God bless you, dear Hawkins.\" \"Is there no hope?\" asked Marston, as he followed Mr Hawkins outside the tent."], [143, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 135 \" None whatsoever. Ah, Sir Hubert, I feel for you. You lose a nephew to be proud of. No wonder we were all his friends.\" \" Have you any instructions to leave, Mi- Hawkins ?\" asked Marston, in a broken voice. \" As he grows weaker, you may give him stimulants ; a little brandy from time to time. It can do no harm.\""], [144, "136 CHAPTER VI. When Sir Hubert re-entered the tent, he went to the bed-side, and sat down. \" Dear Deptford, speak freely, and tell me everything you wish done.\" \"Yes, but let me think a little.\" After a short silence, \u2014 \" Poor Fanny,\" he said ; \" poor, dear Fanny, and poor, dear aunt Susan ! It will be a blow to them, for they love me, and will grieve for me. Do you know, uncle, I wish now I had not cut down those three Russians at their guns. They were only do ing their duty, and no doubt there are those far away to whom they are dear, and who will mourn for them. What right had I to take their lives for doing their duty !\""], [145, "137 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Let the responsibility rest on him who sent them there to die,\" Marston replied \u2022 \" on the hard, bad man, the cause of all this misery and bloodshed. If they were doing their duty, you were but doing yours. The most severe casuist could find no cause of offence in this.\" \" I suppose you are right. I thought like you at the time, I know, but it is strange what a difference a few hours may make in the view one takes of things.\" \" My dear Deptford, you are exhausting yourself by dwelling on such thoughts.\" \" Uncle, if it can be managed without much inconvenience, I should like to be sent home. I know Fanny would wish it.\" \" Yes, yes. I will attend to your slightest wish.\" \" And, uncle,\" continued Lord Deptford, with an effort, \" you must cut off some of my hair, and divide it into two packets, which you must give yourself, not send, to Fanny and aunt Susan. Promise.\" \" As regards Miss Digby, I promise willing ly; but as regards your aunt, I know not when"], [146, "138 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. we shall meet. I do not even know her pre sent address.\" \" Uncle, uncle, she loves you with her whole heart and soul ; loves you passionately, de votedly ; better, I do believe, than woman ever loved man before. And that,\" he added, with a faint smile, \"is much for an engaged lover to say of another man's wife.\" \" I thought so too, once,\" replied his uncle, \" but I grieve to say that is past.\" \" Do not believe me, but believe her,\" re joined Lord Deptford. \" You will find her letters to me in my desk. How she urged me to persuade you to join us, thinking it the safest service, for I had been complaining that we never had anything to do. Poor, dear Su san ! she thought I could not see through her little artifice. She did not foresee this day. Thank God, she has been spared this. She has escaped the agony of thinking that, if you were hurt, it was owing to her suggestion. Promise me to read her letters, and then doubt if you can.\" \" I do promise you.\" \" Uncle, I am dying, and, as I told Hawkins,"], [147, "139 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. I am not afraid to die. But though I strive to keep down any rebellious feelings against the decree of Him, before whose judgment seat I am so soon to stand, I confess I should like to live. I have so much to make life desirable,* \u2014 youth, health, rank, a profession I like, a fortune amply sufficient for my wants ; but these I think I could resign almost with out a sigh. But I have a mother, sisters, friends, a betrothed wife, Susan, yourself, \u2014 and when I think of those I love, I do regret an existence which has hitherto been a very happy one, with a fair prospect of infinitely greater happiness in the future. And yet I declare to you that these regrets would vanish, or nearly so, if my last hours wrere soothed by the hope of a reconciliation between you and Susan, who, with Fanny, are the persons I love best in the world. Uncle, I entreat of you to throw aside every feeling of wounded pride or animosity against the wife, whom the fear of having lost1 your affection for ever has made utterly miserable. Can you reject the last prayer I shall ever make you ! Can you refuse this consolation to a dying man !\""], [148, "140 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" God bless you, dear Deptford,\" exclaimed Marston, while the tears streamed down his face. \" God will bless you, for ' Blessed are the Peacemakers,' and I thank you, in Susan's name and my own, for the anxiety you show at such a moment for our happiness.

Within a month.\" \" Thank God. Ah, you do not know how happy you have made me.

You know- how honest and trustworthy he is.\" Marston nodded assent ; and Jenkins, who had remained all the time outside the tent, answering the innumerable inquiries which were made of him with the fatal words, \" No hope,\" was summoned in. \" Jenkins,\" said his master, in a very feeble voice, \"we must part; but I have secured for you a better master than I have been.

That you should think of me at such a moment ! \" \" Leave us now, Jenkins,\" said Marston. \" We must not agitate Lord Deptford.\" \" I think that is all,\" resumed Lord Dept ford, after a short pause. \"And now, having done with man, let me turn my thoughts to God. Indeed, I feel too weak to talk.\" \" Take a little brandy to strengthen you,\" said Marston. \" No, uncle, thank you. Nothing more will pass my lips on earth.\" The rest of that weary night was passed in silence. For the first hour, the moving of his lips seemed to indicate that the dying man was engaged in fervent though silent prayer. Then he fell into an uneasy sleep, waking from time to time, but with his mind evidently wandering, \u2014 the names of Hubert, Fanny, Susan, mixed with words of command, falling from his lips by turns. Towards morning he"], [152, "144 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. grew more restless, and as the first pale rays of the autumn sun straggled into the tent, he half sprung up from the bed, exclaiming, \" Uncle, uncle, the time' is come. Give me your hand, for it is all darkness with me. Thank you for your loving kindness. Give my love to Susan. Believe me, you will see her soon ; when and where you least expect it. Tell dearest Fanny that my heart was entirely hers \u25a0 I never loved any one but her. I leave her, as my most precious legacy, to. Susan's care and yours. Say that my last thought was of her; her name the last \u2014 \" The sentence was never finished. Heaving a deep sigh, Lord Deptford fell back upon the bed, and without a struggle his last breath passed away. When Jenkins looked into the tent two hours later, he found his new master sitting motionless as a statue, gazing on the cold re mains before him, and still clasping in his the hand of the nephew he had loved so well. Without disturbing him, Jenkins went in quest of Colonel Manning, and soon returned with him."], [153, "145 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" My dear Marston,\" said the colonel, entering the tent without ceremony, \" I will not attempt to offer you consolation or con dolences for such a loss as this. It is irrepar able ; and there is not a man in the army who knew your nephew, who will not sympathize with your affliction. What brought me here was to know if I can be of the slightest use to you. You know you may command me to the utmost.\" \"Thank you, Manning: it is irreparable,\" Marston replied, rising, and endeavouring to preserve his composure. \" If you can manage to have his actual death kept out of this day's dispatch, it will be a great relief to me, as it will give me time to prepare my sister and others. And there is another thing I am most anxious about. This may happen to any of us ; and should it be my fate to be killed or even wounded, keep me out of the returns alto gether for some days \u2014 as I am only a volun teer this will be easy enough \u2014 -and write to the Dean of Newport, whose address I will give you, begging him to break it to my wife.\" Colonel Manning promised to comply with VOL. III. 10"], [154, "146 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. this last request, and to do his best in regard to the other, and then asked if that was all, if there was nothing else he could do, any letters he could write, any arrangements he could make. \" Nothing, my dear Colonel, nothing, thank you,\" replied Marston. \" I have a heavy day's work before me, and a heavy heart to do it with, but I must do it myself.\" Sir Hubert settled at once that Lord Dept ford's body should be sent to England, in ac cordance with the wish he had expressed, and Jenkins was appointed to accompany it. As it was to remain in Marston's tent till the necessary preparations were completed, he himself obtained permission to occupy his nephew's quarters in the cavalry camp during that time. His first act was to look for Susan's letters, which he read with great attention, kissing them more than once as he proceeded. He then sat down to write to Lady Deptford and her daughters, and then to Digby. It was a painful task, and one not easy to ac complish, but the most difficult still remained. Susan must be told of the death of her best"], [155, "147 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. friend, her zealous and untiring advocate. But how ? After making and discarding one or two beginnings, he wrote the following letter to the Dean of Newport. \" My dear Dean, \u2014 Again I must have re course to your kindness; and this time on the most painful occasion on which it has yet been my lot to trouble you. My dear nephew, Lord Deptford, is dead. He was mortally wounded yesterday in that fatal Balaklava business, and died this morning in my tent. My poor wife loved him as the affection which he always showed for her deserved : and it is to entreat of you to find some means of communicating this sad event to her, without allowing it to come too suddenly upon her, that induces me to trouble you with this letter. I wish you also to assure her, with my affectionate regards, that this is the only reason which prevents my writing to her myself. As soon as I have a little recovered from the distress of mind into which this most melancholy event has thrown me, she shall hear from me. I wish also to thank her for her compliance with my request to inhabit Thornwood."], [156, "148 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Lord Deptford's remains will be sent to England, and according to my present inten tions, for I am his executor, will be buried at Thornwood, as he had no family place of his own. His late servant Jenkins will go with them, and as I presume Lady Marston will be at the Priory at that time, I wish her to keep him as her own servant, for the present at all events. He was close to poor Deptford when he died, and will give her all the details. \"Believe me to be, dear Mr Dean, with many apologies for the trouble I am giving you, \" Very faithfully yours, \"H. Marston \" Camp before Sebastopol, Oct. 26, 1854.\" Lord Deptford had not exaggerated the trouble which his will would [entail on his executor. With the same thoughtful kindness w*hich had characterized his last hours, he had left memorials, \u2014 quite as multifarious as poor Dick's, though rather more valuable, \u2014 to all those in any way connected with him. To Fanny Digby, as he had told Sir Hubert, he left the greatest part of his personal property,"], [157, "149 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. bequeathed to him by a great uncle ; to Cap tain Fleming the money he had lent him for the purchase of his troop ; to his brother Charley his dressing-case ; trinkets of some sort or other, of which he had a profusion \u2014 for he was rather addicted to jewellery \u2014 to each of his relations. Then followed codicil upon codicil, the last dated only two days before his death, bequeathing rings, studs, chains, sleeve buttons, guns, pistols, swords, to his personal friends, and even to his acquaintance. No one was forgotten. Jenkins was to receive an annuity of forty pounds. During the day on which he died, he may be said to have lain in state. The men of his troop, those who remained of it at least, asked and obtained permission to act as a guard of honour round the tent in which he lay, the canvas of which was thrown back. Hundreds crowded in to take a last look at the remains of one who, while he had gained the esteem of his superiors and the friendship of his brother officers, had endeared himself to those under his command by his kindliness of manner and constant attention to their wants. As they"], [158, "150 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. gazed on those calm and placid features, on which something like a smile had settled, it seemed difficult to realize the fact, that the spirit which had animated them had fled for ever. Two succeeding nights Marston kept his sad and solitary watch over those loved re mains. On the third day they were sent down to Balaklava to be embarked for England. On parting with Jenkins, Sir Plubert put a letter into his hand. \" You will take this to Miss Digby,\" he said, \" and ask if she wishes to see you. I have told her that you were in attendance on her betrothed husband to the last. You will attend to her wishes in every thing that regards Lord Deptford's funeral, in case she desires to make any change in what I propose, and you will consult her brother, Mr Digby, whenever you require advice or assist ance. For the rest, I have drawn up your in structions in this paper. You will probably find Lady Marston at Thornwood, and I wish you to remain with her till you hear from me. Of course you will write to me as soon as you reach England.\""], [159, "151 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. In the mean time, Lady Marston, little dreaming of the loss she had sustained, was gradually recovering from the effects of her confinement. With the full approbation of Dr Baird, she nursed her child herself, and under this system it throve amazingly. Of course it was a miracle of infantine size, strength, beauty, and grace \u2014 a sort of baby Hercules and Apollo melted into one. Joking apart, it was a very nice baby, as babies go, and she pursued, with unwearied zeal and patience, the pleasing and congenial occupation of tracing in its unformed features some resem blance to the father, who was still unconscious of its existence. She almost cried with vexa tion when Caroline, after vain endeavours to evade a declaration of opinion on the subject, confessed to her that she thought the young gentleman more like his mother. One point Caroline Marston had urged upon her sister-in-law, and, to her great delight, after a short discussion, found her amenable to reason. This had occurred on the very day preceding her confinement. Dr Baird hap pened to be present, and the subject-matter of"], [160, "152 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. debate was the propriety of informing Sir Hubert, and the world at large, of the event as soon as it took place. When this proposal was first made, Susan loudly exclaimed against it. She wanted to surprise Sir Hubert on his return, by presenting his son to him, while he was still unaware of his good fortune. \" It is upon that, and that alone,\" she said, \" that I build all my hopes of obtaining his forgiveness.\" \"Believe me, dear Susan,\" replied Caroline, \" you will not need a surprise to obtain that. In fact, it might have quite a contrary effect. He would very probably, and with good reason, be extremely displeased at having been kept so long in ignorance of an event, of so much importance and such deep interest to him- But there is another consideration. Your silence at such a time might be of the greatest prejudice to your child. If anything, which God forbid, were to happen to Sir Hubert, his next heirs might contest the rights of a child whom he had never recognized, and of whose birth he was utterly ignorant, and it might be very difficult to establish them. I expect the"], [161, "153 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Dean here to-night, and he will tell you the same thing. What is your opinion, Dr Baird ? \" \" I agree with you entirely ; I think that too much publicity cannot be given to Lady Marston's accouchement, to prevent the possi bility of her fair fame and the legitimacy of her child being called in question.\" \" Could any one be so wicked ! \" said Susan. \" Ah, yes, I know but too well of what wicked ness men are capable. Do what you think right; I will be guided entirely by you.\" \" And, my dear Susan, you must send some message to Sir Hubert at the same time.\" \" Oh, I cannot \u2014 I dare not, he forbade me. It will only add to his displeasure.\" \" Indeed you must ; you ought \u2014 \" began Caroline, but Dr Baird broke in \u2014 \" Do you know, Lady Marston, you are giv ing me a very bad opinion of this husband of yours, by supposing that he could feel anything but kindness for his wife at such a time.\" Susan's eyes kindled, but she suppressed the wTords that were on her tongue. \"Well, then,\" she said, \"give him my dutiful regards, and tell him I hope he will"], [162, "154 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. send his blessing to his son, and to his wife for his son's sake.\" She said it so humbly, that Caroline could hardly refrain from tears, and the Doctor, jumping up, exclaimed \u2014 \" I can only say, Lady Marston, I am very thankful you are not my wife. You would have utterly spoiled me, and made me a much worse man than I am already.\" In consequence of this conversation, as soon as Marston minor made his appearance, the Dean wrote off to Sir Hubert to announce the event, giving him at the same time his wife's message, and enclosing a tiny lock of his son's hair, which Susan insisted upon sending as a sample of her production. As the Dean had come to Highbeach, at Caroline's request, solely to relieve her by his presence of some part of her responsibility, which she felt to be very embarrassing, he returned to town as soon as all was well over, and going straight to Digby's office, to our friend John's infinite astonishment, announced to him that Lady Marston had that morning been delivered of a son."], [163, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON 155 \" By Jove, you don't say so ! \" said Digby, as soon as he could recover from his surprise. \" This is indeed a most extraordinary piece of news.

However, as Lady Marston intends to go to Thornwood as soon as she is well enough to move, and as I understand you and Mrs Digby have promised to accompany her, there will not be much longer any occasion for mys tery, and no doubt she will tell you all that has happened in the last few months. In the mean time, will you have the goodness to take charge of this packet ?

From the moment of their engagement, I have had her interest as much at heart as her husband's. I rejoiced at the happiness of their first year of married life, I grieved over the dissensions which ended in their separation, and nothing will give me sincerer pleasure than to hear of their reconciliation.\" The following day, the great event was an-"], [166, "158 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. nounced in all the leading London papers : \u2014 \" On the 25th inst., Lady Marston, of a son and heir.\" As Susan gained strength, her restlessness and intense desire for news increased. Caro line w*as driven to her wit's ends to invent expedients, by which she might obtain the first reading of the Times, that, in case of disastrous intelligence, she might be able to mitigate the first shock. Sergeant-Major Clarke \u2014 for he had been promoted to that dignity \u2014 had entered also on his duties as special correspondent and private intelli gencer; and very efficiently he discharged them. He was already, according to his \u25a0own showing, on terms of great intimacy with Sir Hubert, who had attached himself to his company ; and in rather a discursive way, he gave a very satisfactory account of that gentleman's sayings and doings, his health, and general prosperity. Susan had made her appearance down-stairs for the first time, and was lying on the sofa near the fire, when the postman arrived with the newspaper, of which her sister-in-law took"], [167, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 159 immediate possession. \" Give it me, Caro line,\" she cried. \" Let me see it first.\" \" My darling,\" replied Caroline, \" you know Dr Baird said you must not try your eyes too much. Lie quiet, aud let me read it to you.\" \" But promise to read every word.\" Caroline began, reading one column with one eye, and trying to skim down the next with the other. \" A cabinet council was held yesterday at the Foreign Office, at which were present the Lord Chancellor \u2014 \" \"Oh, Caroline,\" exclaimed Susan, impa tiently, \" what do I care for the stupid coun cil and Chancellor ! Go to the news from the Crimea.\" There was no help for it. \" There has been a cavalry action,\" said Caroline. \" Oh, how glad I am that Hubert would not join them ! But read about it.\" Caroline Marston did as she was told ; but when she came to the names of the killed and \u25a0wounded, stopped suddenly. \" What is it, Caroline ? Hubert was there ! Hubert is killed ! \" \" No, no, my love. His name is not even"], [168, "160 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. mentioned. He could not have been there ; but poor Lord Deptford is hurt.\" \" Deptford ! Impossible ! And yet, why not ! Show it me. * Captain Lord Deptford dangerously wounded,'\" she read out. \" Poor Deptford ; poor, dear Deptford, my friend, my brother ! At least, he will have Hubert to take care of him, but who will take care of Hubert now, if he, too, is dangerously w-ounded ? Poor Deptford ! Thank God, he is not killed. What does ' dangerously ' mean ? \" Caroline could not, or w*ould not, say what dangerously meant ; but Dr Baird, who was applied to when he made his daily visit, Avarned by a look from Caroline, explained that it meant a very troublesome wound, \u25a0which might lay him up for some time. \" He will not die of it, then ?\" asked Susan. \" My dear Lady Marston,\" he replied, \" it would be presumptuous to pronounce on such a point without knowing more, but there are scores and hundreds of men who have been returned as dangerously wounded, who are walking about as well as I am.\" With this evasive answer poor Susan was"], [169, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 161 tolerably well satisfied ; but the following day dispelled all illusion. Caroline Marston w-alked into her room with a letter in her hand, and an expression of deep concern on her counte nance. \" Dear Susan, it was worse than we feared. Lord Deptford's wounds are most dangerous.\" \"I understand you. He is dead,\" said Susan, turning white as a sheet, but in a calm tone of voice. \" He is, indeed. I have received a letter from the Dean, enclosing one from your hus band. Would you like to see it ?\" \" From Hubert ? Oh, yes, give it me. Does he say anything of me ?\" She read it through attentively ; and then, but not till then, burst into tears. Taking up her child, she said, \" Ah, my child, my darling, you know- not what you and I have lost. The best, the truest, the kindest ! Ah, Deptford, dear Dept ford, I shall never again find a friend like you. Oh, if Hubert had but written to me himself ! \" \"My dear Susan,\" said her sister-in-law, \" that is a little unjust. He feared the shock 11 VOL. III."], [170, "162 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. this sad event would give you without some preparation. You see he says he will write to you shortly. You cannot doubt his sympa thy with your affliction.\" \" Yes, he is kind, he is generous, he feels for me \u2014 but, Caroline, he does not love me. If he loved me, at least if he loved me as I love him, he would have known that one line from him w-ould have been better than all the pre paration in the world ; one word from him would have been my best consolation in this most grievous affliction.\" Caroline tried in vain to combat this idea. Susan clung to it tenaciously, though she said little. Her own grief, however, did not make her forgetful of that of others. \" Dearest Fanny,\" she wrote to Miss Digby, \"do not look for words of comfort or consolation from me; I have none to offer. To both of us, the loss we have sustained is irreparable. Others no doubt will weep for him, but we mourn for him, for better than others we knew his worth.

Pray for him and for me, for my husband may be the next victim. There may be a heavier blow in store for me than even poor Deptford's death.\" Sergeant Clarke also wrote to his wife, but his letter contained nothing new. \" Sir Hubert,\" he wrote, \" is quite well, but he is cut up terrible. I would not for the Queen's golden crown be the Cossack who first comes within range of his rifle ; for they say it was the wound from the lance that did the job. The others were not mortal.\""], [172, "164 CHAPTER VII. Marston w*as, to use the sergeant-major's expression, cut up terrible. He had loved his nephew as a younger brother, and was begin ning to look upon him as his heir. He loved him too none the less for the constancy Avith which he had advocated Susan's cause, and he was fully resolved to do his utmost to give effect to the last wish Lord Deptford had ex pressed, by attempting a reconciliation with his wife. How* to set about it in the first in stance embarrassed him not a little, and after much reflection, he determined to take the first steps as soon as he heard of her being estab lished at Thornwood. He would have done so earlier, but he felt a repugnance to writing"], [173, "165 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. to her for such a purpose through the medium of a third person, and he preferred waiting till he could address her at her own home. In the mean time, he lived entirely alone, declining all invitations, passing all the time on which he was not on duty in his own tent, and admitting no one, except his friend Colonel Manning. It was late in the evening of the 4th of November, as he was sitting alone, moodily chewing the cud of his melancholy fancies, when the colonel entered with some letters in his hand. The rain had been falling in torrents all day, and as Manning shook the wet from his cloak, he bore some resemblance to a huge Newfoundland dog just emerging from the water. \" Here are some letters for you, Marston. Having Christian feelings, I have brought them down myself, instead of sending my servant out such a night as this. The least you can say is, that I am a good fellow ; and the least you can do is to give me a cigar and a glass of brandy-and-water, while you read your letters in peace. How comfortable you are here ! \""], [174, "166 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \"Yes, it is a capital tent, actually rain proof ; and I have got a clever little fellow of a Frenchman, who flatters himself he can speak English, and who knows how to keep things tolerably tidy.\" He then furnished his visitor with what he required, and proceeded to open his letters with considerable anxiety, for he had recognized the Dean's handwriting. At first, it seemed as if he could scarcely comprehend the contents. In a state of be wilderment, amounting almost to stupefaction, he read the letter through twice, before he was thoroughly master of its meaning. \" Good Heavens ! \" he exclaimed, at last, \" is it possible ? \" \" Is what possible ? \" asked the colonel. \" No bad news, I hope ?\" \" Bad ! No, I should think not. My wife, my Susan, has just been confined of a son. Oh, my God, make me truly thankful for such a blessing at such a moment ! \" And he covered his face with his hands. \" My dear Hubert, I congratulate you most sincerely. I trust Lady Marston and the child are doing well.\""], [175, "167 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Perfectly. At least when this was writ ten, which was on the same day.\" \" Well, I will leave you, for I see you would rather be alone.\" \" No, no. Finish your grog, and your cigar. I see this is a letter from Digby ; per haps he tells me more.\" Digby had no more to tell; but his last sentence contained a strange admission for a lawyer to make. \" Acting,\" he said, \" upon what I feel sure must be your w*ishes, I have done what . few men, certainly no one of my profession, would venture to do. I have taken upon myself to burn the will you left with me, and which would leave your son a beggar at your death. Send me immediately an authorization to do what I have already done, and get some one to witness it. Some thing like Jedburgh justice you will say ; hang a man first and try him afterwards \u2022 but better late than never. And send me your instructions for a new will.\" \" That master John Digby is a trump,\" said the colonel. \" I like a fellow who will risk his neck, or transportation, or whatever it is, to"], [176, "168 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. serve a friend. But if I were you, I would send him a telegram to-night, and write to him to-morrow by the post. I will witness both, and take the telegram to-night on my way back. It will not be many yards out of my way, and no delay ought to be risked. If this w*eather lasts, I should not be surprised if the Russians were to favour us with another sortie.\" The telegram was drawn up and witnessed, as also another authorization of the same im port to be sent by post, and then Colonel Man ning took his leave ; but before quitting the tent, he said \u2014 \"You must dine with us to-morrow, that we may all drink the young gentleman's health. What is he to be called ? Of course you mean him to be one of us when he is old enough ? \" \"Oh, of course; and in the meantime I accept your invitation with pleasure. With regard to my son's name, I should like him to be called James, after my poor nephew, but I shall leave it to Susan. She will do as she likes.\""], [177, "169 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" You are really a model husband. When you write to Lady Marston, pray recall me to her favourable recollection, and present my warmest congratulations to her. Good-night, and do not forget to-morrow.\" \" A model husband ! I am afraid my poor darling does not think me a model husband,\" said Marston to himself, when he found him self alone, \" but I will endeavour to be so. No more procrastination now. I will write to her to-night before I go to bed.\" He sat down to write, but while in the act of drawing the ink-stand to him, a violent gust of wind found its way into the tent, extin guished his light, and blew over table and o o * lamp. \" That settles the matter,\" he said, groping his way to his bed. \" After all, it could not have gone to-night, and I will write the first thing to-morrow.\" L'homme propose, et Dieu dispose. For some hours Sir Hubert lay awake, meditating on the new prospects opening to him. At length he closed his eyes, but before he had been long asleep, he again awoke to see his French servant standing by his bed with a"], [178, "170 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. lantern in his hand, while at the same moment the sharp rattle of musketry made itself heard at no great distance. \" What is it, Frangois ? \" he exclaimed. \"A sortie, or a reconnaissance en force, Milor.\" A short time sufficed to see Marston dressed and equipped. \"Your rivolvere, Milor. You forget to take him. I clean him yesterday.\" Marston strapped on his revolver, and in a few minutes had found his way to that part of the field where his regiment was engaged. In less than two hours he was brought back to his tent, \u2014 alive, indeed, but severely wounded. While the Russians were being repulsed at Inkermann, and defeated in all their attempts to raise the siege of Sebastopol, which, ' like a wounded snake, dragged its slow length along,' Susan's time was passed in anxiously calculat ing the days and hours which must elapse be fore a letter could be received from her husband, in reply to those announcing to him the birth of his son. Caroline's time, on the other"], [179, "171 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. hand, was passed in proving to her com panion, by the most ingenious calculations, \u2014 some derived from the science of numbers, such as adding together the miles by land to the miles by sea, to be traversed by the said letters ; others from natural philosophy, which suggested the probability of adverse winds and currents, floods, falls of snow, broken bridges, and impassable rivers and mountains, \u2014 that she must make up her mind to wait with patience, for some little time longer. \"Patience!\" she exclaimed, one evening, when the small stock she possessed of that commodity had been exhausted rather earlier than usual, \u2014 \"it is easy for you to talk of patience. You have not a husband whom your wickedness drove to the Crimea to be killed. I heard of poor Deptford's death soon enough ; but I think every thing goes slower every day.\" This is, certainly, not the opinion of the age in which we live, neither was it Caroline Marston's. \" My dear Susan,\" she replied, \" the bat tle of the Nile was fought in August, and the"], [180, "172 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. news did not reach England till October ; and yet Egypt is much nearer than the Crimea.\" Susan, I am afraid, was about to make some disparaging remarks on the importance of naval victories, and the interest they excite, as compared with the achievements of the sis ter-service. She had got as far as, \" Who cares,\" when the door opened, and the servant announced the Dean of Newport. \" The Dean ! \" exclaimed Caroline. \" The Dean ! \" echoed Susan. \" Then he has letters for me.\" But there was something in Dr Crossby's appearance and greeting, as he entered, that struck her with an instinctive conviction that he had come to announce some misfortune. \" Have you heard from my husband ? \" she asked. \"No, not from Sir Hubert, but from his friend, Colonel Manning. Dearest Susan, I am the bearer of bad news, but it might have been worse. Your husband has been wounded, but though severely, he is in no danger of death.\" \" Ah, so they said of poor Deptford. Dr"], [181, "173 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Crossby,\" she said, in a piteous tone, throw ing herself on her knees before him, and grasping his hand, \" I implore you to tell me the truth, the whole truth, as you shall an swer for it before God. I am strong. I can bear it.\" \" It is because I know you have strength of mind that I have told you the truth, and the whole truth, without preparation. And before you rise from your knees, thank God for having spared your husband's life in this dreadful battle, which has made so many widows and orphans. Shall I read you Colonel Manning's letter ? It came with the dispatches this morning.\" \" Yes. No ; give it me myself.\" The Dean reflected for a moment, and then put it into her hands. It was dated Novem ber 5th, 1854, 6 p.m. The colonel said that, though he had but few minutes to spare, he was anxious to fulfil a promise he had made Sir Hubert Marston some time ago, to write to the Dean in case of any mishap be falling him, that the necessary steps might be taken for imparting the information to Lady"], [182, "174 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Marston. \"This morning,\" he went on to say, \" the Russians made a desperate but un successful attempt to force our position. Our loss was very heavy. Amongst hundreds of others, Sir Hubert fell severely wounded, and, more fortunate than many, w*as extricated from the melee, and brought back to his tent. A musket-ball had passed through his arm without injury to the bones, and entered his side. At first there was some difficulty in finding it, but I am rejoiced to say that it was extracted two hours ago, to the sufferer's great relief. Pray tell Lady Marston with my kindest regards, that the surgeon assures me there is no danger to life from the wound, un less some unfavourable accident intervene. It will of course put an end to his soldiering. As soon as he can be removed, which, how ever, will not be, I fear, for many weeks, he will no doubt return to England. In the mean time, Lady Marston may depend upon my writing as frequently as I can. But, as my time is not altogether at my own disposal, I may be a little irregular in my correspond ence, in which case I entreat of her to believe"], [183, "175 SIR HUBERT MARSTON.. that no news is good news. I need not say that Marston will be as well taken care of as the means at our disposal permit. I am happy to say that he has a very intelligent French servant about him, and I have sent over to the French camp to see if I can get a nurse for him. Our own are all engaged. Poor fellow ! I left him last night rejoicing over the birth of his son. He was to have dined with us to-day to celebrate the event. As he cannot write himself, I may as well mention that, when I asked him what the name of his boy was to be, he said he should leave it to Lady Marston, but that he himself would like him to be called James, after poor Lord Deptford. I enclose our surgeon's state ment of the case, as it may be some satisfac tion to Lady Marston, and, at all events, will enable her own medical man to set her mind at ease.\" \" Dear, good Colonel Manning ! \" said Susan through her tears. \" Caroline, will you let Jane go for Dr Baird at once to explain what the surgeon says ? \" It was not long before the worthy doctor"], [184, "176 SIR HUBERT AIARST0N. made his appearance. \" Nothing the matter, I hope ? \" said he, on entering. \"Nothing with me, or baby, Dr Baird,\" she replied, with astonishing composure ; \" but my husband is wounded, severely, not danger ously. They have sent me a statement writ ten by the surgeon who attends him, and I wish you to tell me what it means. But swear to me,\" she continued, laying her hand on his arm, and looking at him as if she would read his inmost soul ; \" swear to me that you will conceal nothing, that you will tell me the worst.\" \" Lady Marston, I never swear, but I pro mise you on the word of an honest man to comply with your request literally, and with out any mental reservation. Ha ! Trentham ! \" he said, as he glanced at the signature. \" I know him well. A kind-hearted man as ever lived, and a first-rate surgeon. Sir Hubert could not be in better hands.\" He read the document through attentively, and then con tinued, \u2014 \" It appears that it is a severe, a very severe wound, but, thank God, no vital part is touched. At first they were afraid of"], [185, "177 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. internal hemorrhage, and that might have been fatal, but as soon as the ball was extracted all fear of that ceased. Sir Hubert will probably be confined to his bed for some time, but of his ultimate recovery there seems to be no reason to doubt.\" \" But, Doctor, what is hemorrhage, and what does Mr Trentham mean by an unfavourable accident ? \" \" Hemorrhage, my dear, is a word we learned Pundits use to express an excessive flow of blood, such, for instance, as ensues from the rupture of a vessel. With regard to the accident, it means, I presume, that much depends upon Sir Hubert's taking care of himself, and being properly attended to. On this score, however, I think you need be under no apprehension. Sir Hubert is no longer a boy to play tricks with himself, and no doubt he is by this time in the hands of a good and experienced nurse. I think, however, in your place I should send him out one of his own servants. I suppose there is some one upon whom you can thoroughly depend.\" \" Yes. I will write to Mr Digby about it 12 VOL.

Baby w*ants me.\" \"How calmly she takes it,\" remarked the Dean, as she left the room. \"Yes,\" said the doctor, in a hesitating manner; \" provided it lasts.\" The proviso was a wise one. He had hardly finished speaking, when the door opened again, and Susan reappeared, her face bathed in tears. She went straight up to the Dean. \" Do not think me ungrateful,\" she said, \" if I have not thanked you as you deserve ; and you too, Dr Baird, for your great, your exceeding kindness to a very unhappy woman. Pray for me, as you would for a widow. Pray for my poor little child, as you would for an orphan. Per haps at this moment he is so.\" \" My dear Lady Marston,\" said Baird, \" for, your child's sake you must try to compose yourself.

We shall have to provide a wet-nurse for him.\" \" A what ! a wet-nurse for my son, my \u25a0 darling ! No, Dr Baird, if I have nothing but my heart's blood to give him, he shall drain it to the last drop, before I consent to give him up to another woman ! \" As she turned to leave the room, Caroline Marston rose to accompany her, as she was in the habit of doing every evening, for the pur pose of assisting in putting her nephew to bed. \" Not to-night, dear Caroline,\" she said, kissing her sister-in-law. \" Not to-night, dearest, best of sisters. I have so much to think of. I should like to be alone.\" Before she went to bed, however, Caroline did look in, and found Susan walking about the room with the child in her arms, to whom she w*as singing low melancholy snatches, and talking by turns. \" Yes, baby,\" she was saying; \"Papa was glad when he heard of you, though he would not write to say so. But never mind, my treasure ; it is only poor mamma he does not love. He will"], [188, "180 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. love you dearly, and you will ask him to for give her for your sake. Won't you, my precious?\" \"My dear Susan,\" said Caroline, coming forward, \" how can you take such pleasure in tormenting yourself without the slightest cause ! No doubt, Sir Hubert received his letters too late to answer them that night, and the next day it was no longer in his power. It was the will of God, and to that, dearest Susan, you must endeavour to submit.\" \" No, no, no ! He could find time to dis cuss the name of his son w*ith Colonel Man ning, but he could not find time to write a simple ' God bless you ' to his son's mother. And, Caroline, I well remember that Lucy said that the telegram, which her husband had received from him, was dated that very even ing, the 4th of November. He could find time to send telegrams to his friend, but not a word to his wife. Why should he ! He loves his friend ; he does not love his wife.\" \" But, my dear Susan, remember Mr Digby is his solicitor, and the telegram probably"], [189, "181 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. was on some matter of urgent business. I feel convinced he meant to write to you on that fatal day when he was wounded.\" \" Perhaps. After his friend, perhaps my turn would have come. I try, indeed I try, to say God's will be done, for I know I have brought it all on myself. But I love him so dearly, so very, very much. More than I -ever did before ; for then he was only my hus band, and now in addition he is the father of my child. It is so hard, you cannot guess how hard it is to bear.\" She paused for a moment to wipe the tears from her eyes, and then she resumed : \" How heartless, how un feeling you must think me, Caroline, that I -can dw-ell upon my own sorrows at such a time, with my husband lying wounded, in danger of death, far, far away from those who would nurse and take care of him ! And all through me ! But we know something,\" she continued, addressing her child with a slight flightiness of manner. \" We know something, don't we, my darling?\" \" What do you mean, Susan ? What is it"], [190, "182 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. you know?\" Caroline asked, rather anxious ly ; for the change in Susan's, manner had' startled her. \" Oh, nothing. A secret between baby and me. And I may not tell it, may I, my precious treasure ? Kiss good aunt Caroline, my love.\" Caroline remained a short time longer, but nothing further occurred to alarm her. Susan's conversation was perfectly calm and rational ; and, considering\" the circumstances, showed but little trace of agitation. She talked quietly of the probable further duration of her husband's absence, and even discussed the relative advantages of the different routes by which he might return home. Caroline retired to rest very well satisfied with the general aspect of affairs. She was at breakfast the following morning with Dr Baird and the Dean, both of whom had received a special invitation on the pre ceding evening, when Susan walked into the room without a vestige of colour in her cheeks, and with a look of rigid determination on her brow. It was the first time she had come"], [191, "183 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. down so early since her confinement. \" Susan ! \" exclaimed her sister-in-law, \" how imprudent ! And I can see you have not slept much.\" \" Slept ! Do you think I could sleep with my husband wounded \u25a0 \u2014 dying, perhaps \u2014 writhing in agony ; with no one to wipe the perspiration from his brow' ? No, I have not slept, but I have done better. I have re flected upon what I ought to do, and I have made up my mind. I am going to the Crimea.\" \" To the Crimea ! \" they all exclaimed ; while Caroline let her cup fall in her astonish ment. \" My love,\" she said, soothingly, \" it is im possible. You are nursing your child ; you cannot take him, and you cannot leave him.\" \" Baby will go with me. We settled it all last night.\" \" But, Susan, you cannot go alone. You must take somebody with you, if but for the child's sake. You are not yet strong enough for such a journey. You will kill yourself and him.\" \" Baby and I go alone ; with a servant I"], [192, "184 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. could not preserve my secret. I have made it all out in my own mind.

Do you think I cannot do for my own child what I did for my little sister ? \" \" But, my darling, you were then strong ; and now you have not even recovered from your confinement.

He will protect me. He will protect a poor, desolate woman, who is going, with her child, to nurse her husband.

Will you not say something to turn her from her purpose ? \" \" My dear lady,\" replied the doctor, \" I cannot. For many reasons I think it the best thing Lady Marston can do. It is a right eous and a holy purpose, and will surely bring a blessing with it.\" \"Thank you, thank you, Dr Baird,\" said Susan. \" You are indeed a true friend. May God reward you for your goodness. And I shall want your assistance, too. You must give me a letter to your friend, Dr Trent ham.\" \"Willingly. I see you have considered your plans with care. Let me know what they are, and I will do my best to further them.\" \" I mean,\" she said, speaking with great"], [194, "186 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. rapidity, \" to go from Southampton to Bala klava, if possible, if not to Malta, as I see by the papers there are vessels sailing every day from that place to the Crimea. Then I shall ask Dr Trentham to introduce me to Hubert as an English nurse. I will contrive to dress so that he shall not know me ; and then, when he is strong and well, I will say to him, ' Hubert, I have come from England to bring you your son. For his sake, forgive me.' Ah, if he repulses me then, I will pray to God to let me die at his feet ! \" \" Yes,\" said Baird, \" I think that will do, with some modifications. But I fear it will be necessary to take Trentham into the secret. He will keep it.\" \" Tell him anything \u2014 everything, so that he gets me into Hubert's tent.\" At this moment, the girl who attended on Master Marston announced, that that very in considerate young gentleman was anxious for a few minutes' private conversation with mamma. \" Oh, Dr Baird,\" said Caroline, as soon as"], [195, "187 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Susan had left the room, \" how could you en courage her in this mad project ? \" \" Precisely because it is a mad project.

With regard to the child, it is undoubtedly full young for such an expedition ; but with care, such care as will be bestowed upon it, I trust it will do well, better perhaps than if it were older. And, after all, it would probably suffer more from a change of nurses. It is certainly thriving well now. Still I should be glad if we could gain a few more days.

Then seeing her visitor take the letter from her pocket, and unfold it with great deliberation, \u2014 \"Give it me,\" she said, in so determined a tone of voice, that poor Mrs Clarke, well broken-in to military obedience, allowed her to take it out of her hand without resistance, although she well knew there were passages in it not intended for Mrs Hubert's eye. \" Sit down, Mary, I am so anxious,\" Susan continued, in an apologetical tone, at the same time opening the precious"], [200, "192 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. missive. The first few* lines had no special interest for her. They described the first at- tack on the outlying pickets, and then the writer continued, \u2014 \" By this time our brigade was under arms, Sir Hubert had joined us, and it was not long before w*e were ordered to advance. Our first bit of work was to drive the enemy out of a redoubt they had got hold of. One charge settled that business, and then began a fight, the like of which, them tells me as knows well what fighting is, was never seen or heard of before. It was all hand-to- hand work, man against man, bayonet against bayonet ; and, what with the fog, and what with the drizzle, I'm blessed if you could see ten yards before you. Well, as you may sup pose, there wasn't much order or dressing of line then. We all got broke up into squads *. Sir Hubert and I and about a dozen others found ourselves half-way down the hill, in a sort of ravine covered with brushwood. And, ' Sir Hubert,' says I, - we haven't no officer amongst us. Will you be pleased to take the command ?' And, ' sergeant-major,' says he, ' I am only here as a private. If so be"], [201, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 193 there ain't no officer present, the command belongs to you, and nobody is fitter for it. I shall be proud to fight under your orders.' And didn't the men cheer when they heard him. But there wasn't much time for speech ifying, for a body of Rooshians came stealing down through the fog. And Sir Hubert, he says, ' Now my lads, let us show these Roosh ian slaves they've to do with free-born Britons.' And before you coidd say Jack Robinson, they were upon us; Sir Hubert, he used his revolver. How many he killed I can't justly say, but it's my belief every shot told. And then he clubbed his rifle, and down went the first man like an ox, but the stock of the rifle snapped clean off, and at that moment a shot struck him in the arm and body, and he fell just be tween us and the enemy. A murdering savage of a Rooshian drove his bayonet at him as he lay upon the ground, and ought by rights to have killed him, but it struck upon a locket Sir Hubert wore round his neck, and that saved his life, and before the Rooshian could repeat the blow Sir Hubert's little French servant, who had found us out and joined us, VOL. III. 13"], [202, "194 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. ran him through the body as clean as you please, with a little bit of a sword he had picked up somewhere, fitter to roast larks on than to kill a man. It was the neatest, prettiest done thing ever I see. Then the enemy came with a rush, and says I, ' My lads, we can't leave him here to be spitted by them blackguards.' A precious tussle it was I can tell you. Hand to hand ; and they was ten to our one. Three of our men went down, and I got a wipe over the head with the stock of a musket which made me see blue for one while. We never give back a foot, but it was nearly U P with us, when some of the 20th came up just at the right moment, and cleared the ground with a charge in no time. We lifted up Sir Hubert, whom we hardly ex- pected to find alive, and sent him off to his own tent. Soon after we heard the trumpets of the French, and some of their regiments passed us at a run. It was right enough then, but they came up none too soon, for we was a'most done up. They are out and out brave men, those French, and thorough soldiers too, if they was kept a little tighter in hand, but"], [203, "195 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. they do like a bit of plunder, if they get a chance. That's a fact. Well, as soon as I could get away from duty, and had cleaned myself up a bit, I went down to Sir Hubert's tent, and the first man I see was the little Frenchman, and says he, ' Milor shall not die this time.' For you see, Mary, they know nothing about our nobility ; and though I tried to explain that Sir Hubert is not a lord, but only a barrownite, I could not make him un derstand it, and as it didn't much matter I let it be. And then, says he, ' Milor shall be very tofe.' ' Comang ? ' says I, \u2014 for you must know that I have picked up the language, and they tell me I speak it like a native. ' Yes, he shall be very tofe,' he went on. ' What shall kill anoder man shall not do him no hurt not at all.' So then I found out it was tough the little fellow meant. Just then our surgeon, Dr Trentham, comes out of the tent, and, ' Doctor,' says I, ' may I make bold to ask how Sir Hubert is, for I am instructed special by a lady to write to her all about him.' ' Sir Hubert,' says he, ' will do well enough, I hope, now that we have extracted the ball. You"], [204, "196 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. may tell the lady I think his life is in no dan ger at present, and if she is the lady whose picture he wore in a locket round his neck, you may say it saved his life. It will be a consolation to her, poor thing.' \" And then Francis, \u2014 that's the Frenchman, \u2014 came out, and said his master wished to speak to me. He had heard my voice outside. And ' Sir Hubert,' says I, * I trust you are doing well.' And ' Clarke,' says he, ' I am, and I wish to thank you and the brave men with you for having rescued me ; I shall not forget them or you, for under God, it is to you I owe my life.' And that is true enough, for the Rooshians gave no quarter, and killed all our wounded as they came near. \" Aud Mary, now comes the most surpris ingest thing of all. On a little table by the bed-side lay the locket which had saved his life, all dented and broken, and close to it the picture that had been in it. I could not, for the life of me, keep my eyes off it, and Sir Hubert, he says, ' Are you looking at that picture ? It is the portrait of my wife. What do you think of it ? ' 'I think, Sir Hubert/"], [205, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 197 says I, * she must be the most beautifullest woman ever I see. Beautiful as an angel.' - Yes,' says he, ' beautiful and spotless as an angel. Good-night, Clarke. I shall always be glad to see you, Avhen you are passing my tent.' \" And, Mary, it was the picture of Mrs Hu bert. She is Sir Hubert's wife for certain, but don't you go to let on to no one about it, and don't you say a word to her, to make her suppose that you know who she is. If she had wished us to know it, she'd have told us of it herself. So mum's the word, and mind what you are about. I went down again this morn ing, and all is going on right, if fever don't come on, and that they cannot tell till the third day. Give my duty to the lady, and tell her I will write again this day week, with many thanks to her for her kindness to you. And so no more from your loving husband, \"J.

As Susan read the last part of this long dispatch, her annoyance was extreme at the thought that her secret was now in the power"], [206, "198 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. of two persons, who were in no way bound to her, and over whom she had no control. Her pride would not allow her to enter into any explanation of the equivocal position in which she had placed herself, and she contented her self with saying, \" Your husband is right. I am Sir Hubert Marston's wife, and during his absence am residing with my sister-in-law, Lady Marston, the widow of Sir Hubert's brother. For reasons of my own, I call my self Mrs Hubert. You have my secret, but I am sure you and your husband will keep it.\" Mrs Clarke was loud in her promises of silence and fidelity ; and what is more, she was sincere. \" And, Mary, when you write to your hus band, give him my best and warmest thanks for the trouble he has taken in writing such b long and excellent letter. It is the best I ever read. You must let me keep it.\" Poor Mrs Clarke was rather taken aback by this demand, for she had hardly had time to spell it over herself, but she submitted with out a protest, and a few minutes afterwards Susan entered the drawing-room, exclaiming,"], [207, "199 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Caroline, Caroline, I saved his life, or at least my portrait did, listen to this.\" From that moment her cheerfulness in a great measure returned, and as the prepara tions for her voyage progressed, and the time of her departure drew near, her spirits occa sionally rose to a great height, though these moments of elation were but too frequently succeeded by fits of depression, as she thought of the trials which awaited her. Still she never wavered for a moment in her purpose, and the care and thoughtfulness which she dis played in discussing all the details of her ex pedition, and providing for every emergency which might occur, surprised as [much as they delighted her friends, who saw in them a proof that, if the project itself was a wild one, she was fully equal to the task of grappling with any difficulties she might encounter in carry ing it out. The spirit of independence and self-reliance which she had acquired during the trials of her early life now stood her in good stead. Every evening a cabinet council was held at Ivy Cottage, consisting of the Doctor of divinity, the Doctor of medicine, and the"], [208, "200 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. two sisters-in-law, to talk over what had already been done, and to consider what was to be done next ; but at all these deliberations Susan took the lead. She it was who suggested to Dr Baird the propriety of vaccinating baby before their departure, an overture eagerly accepted by that learned gentleman, much wondering that he had not thought of it him- self, as he thereby gained the coveted extra week of delay. She it was who proposed to the Dean, rather confounded at being thus reminded of his duty, to administer the rite of private baptism to her child, his more public entrance into the Church being deferred till it could be celebrated with all due solemnity in his ancestral halls in the presence of his father. With this wish Dr Crossby complied, and the young gentleman received the names of Hubert James. Then there was the very serious question of money to be considered. She had about sixty pounds of her last half-year's income remain ing, but she had not yet settled with her sister-in-law for her share of the house-ex penses ; Dr Baird's account was still unpaid \u2022"], [209, "201 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. she had many articles to provide for herself and child ; and then she could not leave Mrs Clarke in the lurch, after having made use of her as long as it suited her purpose. With all her ingenuity she could not hope to see much left out of sixty pounds. In vain Caro line vowed, and the Doctor\u2014 forgetful of his principles \u2014 swore that they would not receive a farthing of her money till her return ; she was resolute, and they were obliged to yield. In vain the Dean represented that for such a purpose she might, without the slightest scruple, make use of some part of the very large sum lying useless in her name at Sir Hubert's banker's. No, nothing would induce her to touch a shilling of her husband's money, till she was again living w*ith him publicly as his wife. But she had some trinkets and jewellery of her own, marriage-presents from the numerous friends she could then boast of; did Dr Crossby think she could raise a small sum of money upon them ? The , Dean as sured her there would not be the slightest difficulty, and that if she would confide the negotiation to him, he would undertake to"], [210, "202 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. say that his own bankers would advance her what she required, and take her own time for the repayment. Two or three days afterwards he handed her two hundred pounds. It is needless to say that he had taken base ad vantage of her unsuspecting innocence, and advanced the money himself. All the preparations were completed. Let ters had been received from the sergeant major and Colonel Manning, giving satisfac tory accounts of Sir Hubert's progress towards convalescence. He was pronounced to be out of danger, though still in a state of great w-eakness. A nurse had been procured from our allies, and Susan's impatience to be gone was not diminished by the idea of a dapper young Frenchwoman hovering about her hus band's bed night and day. At length the day fixed for her departure arrived. Caroline and her two male friends accompanied her to Southampton. No vessel was going to the Crimea direct, and she took a second-class passage to Malta on board one of the P. and O. Company's steamers. Dr Crossby was well acquainted with one of the directors, and"], [211, "203 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. easily obtained a special recommendation for Mrs Hubert to those in command. She was even offered a first-class passage at second class fare, but this she declined, not wishing to attract attention. Dr Baird also took an opportunity of telling the stewardess that, if she brought back a letter from Mrs Hubert expressive of satisfaction with the attention she met with, the said stewardess would hear of something to her advantage by applying to him. There could be no doubt that with all these precautions she would be well cared for. But in truth they were not needed. It soon oozed out, somehow, that Mrs Hubert w*as going out to the Crimea to nurse her husband, wounded at the battle of Inkermann ; and it is not too much to say that, at that time, throughout the length and breadth of England, there was scarcely a man or woman wrho would not have assisted her to the utmost of their power. The parting scene w*as a trying one, though they all made a show of cheerfulness and in difference which no one felt. The ship was to sail early in the morning, and Susan deter-"], [212, "204 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. mined to sleep on board that night. Dinner and tea passed away untouched. At last the moment came to say adieu. Susan threw herself into her sister-in-law's arms with all her old passionate violence of feeling. \" Caroline, dearest Caroline, dearest sister,\" she exclaimed. \"Oh, if I could but show you all the love I feel for you ! If I could but thank you as I wish for all you have done for me ! Your forbearance ; your constant attention to my slightest comforts ; your com pliance with my slightest wish ! And I so impatient, so self-willed, so ungrateful ! No, not ungrateful, for though you can never know all I feel for you, I know it, and God knows it too.\" \" Do you think, Susan,\" said Caroline, through her tears, \" that all the advantage has been on your side, that I have derived no benefit from our companionship ! You have given me what I never had before \u2014 a sister to love ; and what I hardly believed in \u2014 a female friend to trust. I do know how well you love me, for I judge your heart by mine.\" The two gentlemen accompanied Susan and"], [213, "205 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. her child on board. Caroline wished to make one of the party, but Baird, who thought there had been quite as much leave-taking as was good for any of them, persuaded her to give it up. They saw Susan very comfortably estab lished in a small cabin which the stewardess had secured for her close to her own. \" Pray for me, dear friends,\" she said, as they bade her adieu. \" This is my last venture. I have set my all upon this, and if I fail, I am lost indeed ! \" \" My dearest Susan,\" said the Dean, \" you will not fail. Before many months are over you will bring back Sir Hubert to Thornwood in triumph.\" \" Or I will never again believe in the worth or gratitude of man,\" added the Doctor. \" God grant you may be right ! \" replied Susan. \" But\u2014 \" The voyage was a most prosperous one; and although the month of December was well advanced, the weather, as they ran into south ern latitudes, became mild and genial as an English spring. Susan had not an hour's sickness, and baby, to use a stereotyped phrase,"], [214, "206 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. wras as good as gold. While the other pas sengers were at their meals, and whenever the opportunity offered of doing so unobserved, she crept upon deck with her child; and whether it was the novelty of the scene, or the bracing air, or the anticipated happiness of finding herself once more in the presence of the husband whom she had provoked to cast her off, but who was still the object of her passionate adoration \u2014 or whether it was all these combined, certain it is that, as Dr Baird had predicted, her mind calmed down and ac quired a healthier tone ; while her hopes of a successful issue to her expedition grew higher, as the good ship advanced to her destined port. The time she passed below was spent chiefly in the cheerful cabin of the stewardess, who, long before the voyage was over, took a motherly interest in the young wife, who was going out unaided on so holy a mission. And if Susan owed much to her constant care and attention, the good lady herself was delighted to find a willing and interested auditor of all her adventures by sea and land, adventures"], [215, "207 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. which certainly lost nothing in the telling. They reached Malta at an early hour in the morning, and the captain, sent word to Mrs Hubert that, if she would wait two or three hours, he would take her ashore in his own boat, and accompany her to a quiet and respectable hotel, which he was in the habit of frequenting himself. Notwithstanding her impatience to land, that she might make all necessary inquiries for the further prosecution of her voyage, she gratefully accepted the offer, and in the course of the morning was comfortably installed in a small apartment at the Cigno d'oro. Nor did the captain's kind ness stop there. He promised to return that afternoon, and accompany her to the different shipping agents, to ascertain what vessels were likely to sail for the Crimea. To her great dissappointment she found that she would have to wait three days, but she consoled her self by the thought that the child w*ould probably be all the better for the delay. The rest of that day she passed in writing to her kind friends at Highbeach, to inform them of"], [216, "208 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. her safe arrival ; and she also indited a long epistle to Lucy Digby, whom she now thought proper to take into her confidence. The following morning the air was so warm and balmy, the sun shone so brightly, that, as soon as her breakfast was over, she put on her cloak, and went out with her child for a walk. After various wanderings, she found herself in the public gardens, and feeling a little fatigued, for baby's weight was beginning to tell, she sat down on a bench to rest for a short time. Very few minutes had elapsed before she heard the sound of voices, and looking up, she saw two gentlemen approaching slowly ; one, slight and apparently very young ; the other, tall and emaciated, leaning rather heavily on his com panion's arm ; and in him, to her unutterable amazement, she recognized her husband. Her first feeling was one of intense joy at seeing his recovery so far advanced ; her next was one of dismay, as she saw her plans thus un expectedly frustrated\u2014 her hopes crushed, her little romance utterly annihilated. A mist came over her eyes, and for once her presence of mind deserted her. She felt stupefied, in-"], [217, "209 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. capable of collecting her ideas, or coming to a resolution. Her features were completely concealed by her veil, and drawing her cloak more closely around her, she hoped to escape notice, and gain time for reflection. Great, therefore, was her terror, when she heard Sir Hubert's voice close to her. \"Let us sit down for a minute,\" he said. \" I feel rather tired.\" His companion complied, and Marston took a seat so close to his wife, that he touched her gown, and could almost hear the beating of her heart. \"And so,\" said he, continuing his conversa tion, \" as soon as I was fit to be moved, or indeed rather before, Trentham packed me off. C. lent me his yacht to bring me here, and to-morrow I continue my homeward voyage.\" \" Of course, Sir Hubert, you go by Mar seilles ? \" \" No. The voyage has done me so much good that I mean to go by sea to Southampton. I have taken a passage in the Adeliza. She is not one of the regular steamers, but she is the first that goes, and has tolerable accommo- VOL. HI. 14"], [218, "210 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. dation. We sail to-morrow evening at sunset.\" \" And how do you manage about your servant ? \" \" Oh, Franqois goes\" to Marseilles. He is anxious to get home, to tell all the wonders he has seen to papa and maman, and probably sa bonne amis. He is a good little fellow, and I am sorry to lose him, but I shall do very well. I have spoken to the man who acts as steward, and he promises to take very good care of me.\" At this juncture Master Marston made an uneasy motion in his slumbers, and put out a little finger which Sir Hubert took, and patted his face. The child opened his sleepy eyes, gazed on his father for a moment, and then quietly resumed his slumbers. \" What a fine, healthy-looking baby,\" said Marston. He was not very knowing in baby-flesh, but he saw* the mother in deep mourning, and thought it would cheer her to hear her child admired. \" I have a little fellow of my own at home,\" he continued, \" much about the same age, I should think. Will you allow me to ask, ma'am, how old your little boy is ? \""], [219, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 211 Susan's heart swelled almost to bursting. Had he been alone she would have thrown herself at his feet ; but in the presence of a stranger \u2014 Her only response wras a sob of irrepres sible emotion. Marston did not repeat his question. He saw her agitation and respected it, though he was far from divining its cause. \" Come,\" he said to his companion, \" I am sufficiently rested. Let us turn homewards. Good-bye, my little man ; \" and again tapping the child's cheek, and raising his hat to the mother, he took his friend's arm, and moved off. But before he had gone a hundred yards he stopped. \" That poor woman,\" he said, \" is evidently in deep grief, perhaps mourning the fate of some brave man who fell beside me in the Crimea ; very probably in pecuniary dis tress. Would you mind, Fitzgerald, taking her this purse, and telling her that I trust she will excuse the liberty I am taking, in offering it to her child in the name of mine.\" Mr Fitzgerald executed his commission, and in a few minutes returned without the"], [220, "212 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. purse, but with his hand full of money. \" Well ? \" said Sir Hubert. \" Well, I gave her your message, and she said that they were in no distress for money ; but if they were, there wras no one from whom she would allow her son to receive assistance more willingly than from Sir Hubert Marston. She returns the money, therefore, with her most grateful thanks, but will keep the purse as a memorial of your kindness to a stranger.\" \" What an extraordinary answer ! By her expressions she must be a lady. Did you see her face ? \" \" No, but I could hear that she was weep ing as if her heart was breaking, poor woman.\" \" Poor woman, indeed ! I suppose she must have seen me out there.\" He made no further remark, but the image of that lonely, mourning mother, with no companion but her infant son, long haunted him at all hours of the day and night. Would Susan have ap proved, or not ? 'Tis hard to say. As soon as they were out of sight, Susan hurried home. She had now made up her mind. For a moment she had deliberated"], [221, "213 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. whether it would not be her best plan to seek out her husband, to tell him with what object she was now in Malta, to throw herself on his mercy, and claim his protection. She felt in stinctively that such an appeal would not be made in vain. But this plan was rejected almost as soon as formed. She could not bring herself to make a parade of a devotion which had failed in its object. Of his com passion she felt sure. But it was not his com passion that she desired. It was his affection, \u2014 the affection she had lost, \u2014 for which her heart yearned, and which she had hoped to regain by services of love. To invoke his pity now would be to degrade herself in his eyes and her own. She would have viewed the case through another medium, had she known that the first use he had made of his returning strength had been to write her a letter, full of the tenderest and most endearing expressions ; not offering forgiveness, but entreating mutual forgetful ness of the clouds which had arisen between them, \u2014 a letter more resembling that of a pas sionate lover to an adored mistress than of a"], [222, "214 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. cold and indifferent husband to a deserted wife. Unfortunately, it did not reach the Dean till three days after Susan's departure ; and on the supposition that she would ere long be in the Crimea, had been forwarded by him to Dr Trentham, accompanied by a note from Baird containing instructions for its safe delivery. The first thing Lady Marston did, on reaching her hotel, was to fasten Sir Hubert's purse by a ribbon round his son's neck, at the imminent risk of promoting the young gentle man's death by strangulation, \u2014 a fate from which, in all probability, he was only saved by the suggestion of the landlady, that it w*ould be quite as secure if tied round his waist. Her next step was to summon the landlord, and explain to him that, having accidentally learnt that her husband had left the Crimea to return to England, it was her wish to get home as soon as possible. She had been told that tthe Adeliza was to sail for Southampton on the following evening, and she wished him to accompany her to the agent's to secure a passage."], [223, "215 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. They soon arrived at the agent's office, but the most difficult part of her task was yet to come. The captain of the Adeliza was there, and, when she made her application, he at once said that it was impossible. His vessel had no regular accommodation for passengers. They had already one invalid, Sir Hubert Marston, going home with them, and he had been assured that there would be no one else. How it was to be managed he did not know. Then Susan told her story ; how she was going to the Crimea to nurse her sick husband, how her husband had been sent home already, and how she was anxious to join him. Just then baby gave a little cry, and Captain Brownrig's heart began to soften. \" Best go by Marseilles, ma'am,\" he said. \"You'll find it quicker and pleasanter.\" \" Oh, no. I could not go through France alone with my child. Let me go with you. I shall feel safer under the protection of my own countrymen.\" She could have used no form of words bet ter calculated to attain her object."], [224, "216 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \"Well, ma'am,\" said the captain, yielding at once, \" we'll do wdiat we can for you, but you won't find any other woman on board, and I warn you, you'll have to rough it. My mate must give you up his cabin, and you can take your meals there, or with us, as you like best. And,\" he continued, as a bright idea struck him, \"if Sir Hubert Marston should want a bit of nursing, I daresay you wouldn't mind lending a hand.\" \" Oh, most willingly,\" she exclaimed, as the thought rose in her mind that perhaps, after all, her self-sacrificing devotion might receive its reward. All further arrangements were easily completed. The passage-money was paid, and Captain Brownrig advised her to go on board early in the afternoon of the following day, that she might have time to settle herself comfortably before they got under weigh. That evening she wrote to Caroline Marston and her cousin Lucy, detailing all that had occurred in the last twelve hours, and inform ing them of the consequent change in her plans, and of her intentions for the future. These were"], [225, "217 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. simple enough. She meant, as soon as she touched English ground, to proceed without a moment's delay to Thornwood, and there await her husband's pleasure ; hoping, by the rapidity of her movements, to conceal from him all knowledge of her absence from England, and her fruitless voyage to Malta. On both of her correspondents she laid the most solemn in junctions of secrecy with regard to it. To her sister-in-law she wrote, \" I must confess, dear est Caroline, that my first sensation was one of bitter disappointment ; but when I came to reflect that, but for that providential meeting, I should have continued my voyage to the Crimea, I felt more forcibly than ever the goodness of God, in preserving me from the blow which would have fallen on me there. He has indeed watched over me with the tender care of a Father ! \" Her letter to Lucy concluded thus \u25a0 \"On passing through London, I shall drive straight to your house, and depend upon finding you, and your husband also, if possible, ready to accompany me.

Lady Marston went on board with her child, and was safely ensconced in her cabin an hour or two before Sir Hubert embarked, in utter unconsciousness of the proximity of those in whom his soul was wrapped up.

He too, as soon as he reached England, meant to run down at once to Thornwood, where he concluded his wife would be by that time, and taking her by surprise, allow her no time for reflection before she found herself in his arms.

The Adeliza was no bad type of John Bull, as we are taught to believe he once existed, but of whom few, if any, representatives are to be met with at the present day, except in the pages of Punch. She appeared to be stout and solidly built, trustworthy, and inviting confidence, honest and bluff, with great ca pacity of stowage, without any pretension to elegance, but scrupulously neat and clean, as far as paint and holystone could make her. In some respects she was an impostor, but altogether she had an air of thorough respect ability about her, and, to complete the re semblance, she was decidedly slow. She had engines and a screw-propeller certainly, but with steam alone four or five knots an hour were the utmost that could be got out of her. In her defence it is but just to say that she was deep in the water, her cargo consisting of medicine, clothes, boots, and other stores of a miscellaneous description, which, being much needed in the Crimea, were naturally returned to England, without having even been un-"], [229, "221 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. shipped, much less inspected. She was well manned, and her captain was an experienced sailor. During the first few days of the voyage, as they ran down the African coast, the weather continued mild. Susan ascertained that Sir Hubert never left his cabin much before noon ; and in the early part of the day she spent many hours on deck with her child, returning for a short time while the captain and his passenger were discussing their dinner. She never got a glimpse of her husband during the whole of this time, and was obliged to content herself with Captain Brownrig's as surance that he was doing well and gradually gaining strength, in answer to her daily in quiry whether he required her assistance. She took great pains to muffle herself up, and as far as possible to disguise her appearance, more especially, as she fancied she saw amongst the crew one whom she had good cause to re member, and whose recognition of her would have been painfully embarrassing. At length they reached Gibraltar, where they remained four-and-twenty hours ; and as"], [230, "222 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Sir Hubert passed that time on shore, Susan had the ship pretty well to herself. She even accepted an invitation to dine with the captain, and contrived to extract from him a vast amount of information, respecting all that her husband had been saying and doing since he came on board. \" And why won't you mess with us regular, ma'am?\" said the worthy skipper; \"I am sure Sir Hubert would not mind it, though he does not yet even know we have a lady on board.\" \" Oh, Captain Brownrig, I should never dare,\" replied Susan, rather hypocritically. \" Lord love you, ma'am, there is no occasion for fear. Sir Hubert has not got a bit of pride about him. He treats me just as if I was one of himself.\" \" You forget baby. You were good enough to let me bring him, but I could not take such a liberty with Sir Hubert.\" \" Ah, true, I forgot baby. I don't suppose Sir Hubert would like it. A man must have a lot of youngsters of his own to take kindly to another man's. Mrs B. hasn't been idle,"], [231, "223 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. I can tell you. I have half a dozen of one sort or another.\" \" I sincerely hope you will find your wife and children well, Captain Brownrig.\" \" No fear of that, ma'am. This is my last voyage. Mrs B. has had a good bit of money left her by an uncle, and nothing will serve her but I must give up the sea. And so, ma'am, I will make bold to drink the health of your good man, and may you soon see him again.\" The following day they were again under steam and canvas on their way to England. But they were in the Atlantic; and the cold of winter began to make itself felt. In other respects the weather was favourable enough. Bright days, starry nights, and the moon almost at the full, with a touch of frost in the air. But this was not to last. When they entered the Bay of Biscay, they encountered cloud and fog, and cold drizzling rain. Still there was not much to grumble at. The wind was at south-east, the water smooth, and, on the whole, they made fair progress. \" Well, Sir Hubert,\" said Captain Brownrig"], [232, "224 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. on the second night of this change of weather, while he pocketed with great complacency six pence, which he had just won of the baronet at backgammon, \" if this wind holds we shall eat our Christmas dinners at home.\" \" At home ! \" said Marston, abstractedly. \" God grant it ! \" The words were scarcely out of his mouth, when a confused noise wras heard on deck, a number of contradictory orders were issued ; then came a crash, and a shock which seemed to double up the old ship, and made her reel and tremble, as if in the agonies of dissolution. Brownrig, followed by Sir Hubert, rushed upon deck. A large steamer had run into them with tremendous violence right amidships, stove in the bulwark, and carried away one of their boats. What further mischief she had done was not immediately apparent. The cause of all this confusion had contrived to clear herself of the wreck she had made, and might be dimly seen standing off under full steam, either unable to render assistance from injuries she herself had received, or, which was more probable, hoping by flight to escape"], [233, "225 SIR HUBERT MARSTCN. the consequences of an action in a court of law. Now, if ever, was the time for a seaman to exert all his energies, but poor Brownrig lost his head altogether ; his faculties seemed ab solutely paralyzed. His mate, a young man of two-and-tw*enty, was quite unequal to such an emergency, and the command devolved upon anybody who chose to assume it. Mar ston went to his cabin, put his purse and whatever was most portable about him, and then seated himself quietly on the poop to see what would come of it. At this moment the carpenter came on deck, and reported that he had been below ; that there were five feet of water in the hold already, and evidently increasing every minute, that the fire in the furnaces was extinguished, and that he could not find the leak. Then arose a frantic cry for the boats, as their only chance of safety. There were two left, and both were lowered without accident. The first was soon filled, and pushed off with out waiting to see what became of the rest- The mate took the command of the other, and VOL. III. 15"], [234, "226 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. saw every one on board of her before he would allow her to be cast off. The last two who entered her were Marston and Captain Brownrig, who was beginning to recover from his stupor. All had left the ship \u2014 all, except two, Susan and her child. In the confusion they were forgotten. Susan had not retired to her berth when the collision took place. Baby had been rather ailing and fractious all day, and his mother was Avalking with him in her arms, up and down her small cabin, trying to soothe and quiet him. On the first alarm, she opened the cabin door, and asked a sailor who was passing, if the ship had struck, and whether they were in danger. \" Lord bless you ! no, Mann,\" replied the man. \" A great lubber of a steamer ran into us, but it's all right now.\" Whether the man believed what he hoped, or only spoke as he did to quiet the lady, and keep her below, on the principle of women being in the way on deck when there is anything to be done, it is impossible to say. If the last, he succeeded. Susan believed him, closed the door, and con-"], [235, "227 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. -turned her attentions to the child. The noise and turmoil on deck did not surprise her ; but w-hen that ceased and all became silent she grew alarmed. The sound of oars, as the first boat left the ship, struck a chill into her heart. Throwing a shawl over her shoulders, she ran upon deck with her child, and by the light of the moon, which at that moment emerged from a bank of clouds, she saw her husband standing up in the stern-sheets, and in the act of pushing off the over-crowded boat from the side of the ship. \" Hubert, Hubert,\" she wildly cried, \" save my child. Not me, not me ; but for the love of God, save our child, our only child ! \" \" My God \u2014 the lady !\" groaned out Brown rig, conscience-struck. Had it been the trumpet of the archaugel calling the world to judgment, Sir Hubert could not have felt greater awe and amazement than he did, when that well-known voice struck upon his ear. But not for that did he lose his presence of mind. Looking up, he saw his wife stretching over the bulwarks, and holding the child towards him."], [236, "228 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Captain Brownrig,\" he said, in a hollow voice, \" you cannot abandon that lady and her child.\" \" We want no women and children here,\" cried a voice in the bows. \"Hold your tongue, Sam, can't you,\" said one of his ship-mates. Captain Brownrig had recovered his self possession . \" Silence, Penge,\" he said, \" I am as much captain here as I was in the Adeliza. Sir Hubert,\" he continued, and the tears rose to his eyes as he spoke, \" you see yourself it is impossible to take her in. We are flush with the water as it is, and nothing short of a mira acle can save us. If the least sea gets up \u2014 and I see signs of it \u2014 we must perish.\" Marston saw that he was right. \" It is true,\" he replied, \" and therefore you will not be sorry to have one passenger the less.\" And seizing a rope that was hanging over board, with an agility, which, considering his weak state, was absolutely marvellous, he"], [237, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 229 swung himself into the rigging, and once more found himself on board the Adeliza. His feet had scarcely touched the deck, when Susan, always passionate, flung herself down, and kissed them, before he had an idea of what she was about. \" Will you not kiss your son ?\" she said, still upon her knees, and holding up her child to him. Marston took him in his hands, and looked at him wistfully for a moment before he kissed him. \"Is this indeed my son?\" he said. \" My God ! \u2014 my God! \" she exclaimed, with a cry of anguish, and covering her face with her hands ; \" He even doubts my truth ! \" \" No, no,\" cried Marston, inexpressibly shocked at the interpretation she put upon his wrords. \" My love, my good, my faithful wife, never, even when I fancied I had most reason to feel hurt with you, did such an injurious thought enter my head for a single moment. They were words without a meaning, or if they meant anything, it was to express my as tonishment at meeting my wife and son here. Tell me how on earth it happens. Why, what"], [238, "230 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. is this ?\" as his eye fell on his own purse sus pended to the child's sash. But, before she could answer, the solution of the mystery presented itself to his mind, as if by revelation. \" What ! was it you,\" he continued ; \" my own wife, who sat by my side on the bench ; my own son, whose cheek I touched ! Ah, I see it all. You heard I w*as wounded, and were coming to nurse me. Say, was it not so ?\" And at that moment he remembered his nephew's prophetic words ; ' Believe me, you will see her soon, when and where you least expect it.' Was it possible that on the brink of the grave he had caught some glimpse of the future ! \" I thought you would like to see your child,\" she replied timidly. \"But, Hubert, Hubert,\" she continued, as she looked over the side of the ship, \" we are lost ! The boat has left us ! It is gone ! \" \" Yes, my love. There was no room for more.\" \" But you ! They have left you too.\""], [239, "231 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" No. They knew I returned on board to share your fate \u2014 the fate of my wife and child.\" \" Oh, good ! Oh, noble ! Ah ! how could I ever \u2014 But, Hubert, is there any hope ? \" \" Well,\" he replied, with astonishing com posure, \" I am not much of a sailor, but it struck me they were in a desperate hurry to take to the boats. Of course when all went, I went too, not knowing who were left behind. We are in great, in imminent danger ; but still I think it possible this old tub may float some hours longer. She does not seem to me to be deeper in the water than she was when they abandoned her ; and to-morrow, in all proba bility, some vessel will come across our track, and pick us up. At all events, we are, to say the least of it, as safe here as in the boats. I do not think they can reach the land.\" \" Poor Captain Brownrig ! He has a wife and children expecting him,\" said Susan. \" Yes ; poor Captain Brownrig ! though he did forget you. But he had quite lost his head. And there is another, too, you know.\""], [240, "232 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Was it, then, Penge ? I thought I recog nized him.\" \" Yes, it was Penge. I heard Brownrig reprove him by name, when his wras the only voice raised against your admittance into the boat.\" \" May God have mercy on him, and give him time for repentance ! \" For a short space they were silent. Then Marston said, \" The father has kissed his son ; will not the wife kiss her husband ? \" With a thrill of joy she threw herself into his arms, all doubt of his love forgotten. \" Gently, gently, my darling,\" he exclaimed, recoiling a little. \" I am not as strong as when I took you in my arms on the first night we met, and I fear I have done myself some harm in scrambling on board, for I feel in great pain. I think I must lie down a little.\" With infinite care and tenderness she as sisted him up the poop-ladder, and then busied herself in preparing a couch for him to lie on. In this she had not much difficulty. The deck was strewed w*ith pea-jackets and other articles of sailor-apparel. She then seated herself by"], [241, "233 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. his side, and proceeded to minister to the wants of Master Marston, whose appetite seemed in no way impaired by the vicissitudes he had gone through. When this operation was com pleted, she again turned to her husband, and asked him how he felt, and if there was any thing she could do for him. \" I am not in so much pain, though weak beyond conception. But, Susan, the night is getting very cold ; put on one of those pea jackets.\" Instead of obeying, she threw an additional one over him. \" I shall do very well,\" she said. \" Have the goodness to remember, Lady Marston, that for the time being I am captain of the Adeliza, and expect implicit obedience from my crew. Do, dearest, and then I will ask you to do something for me.\" The bait took. \" Now then. First put baby down by me, and then, if you are not afraid of going alone, I wish you would get me some brandy and a bottle of water, and some eau de cologne from my own cabin. It opens into the main cabin, in which there is a"], [242, "234 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. lamp burning all night. I feel almost as if I should faint.\" Without an observation she did as he told her. She made a little nest for the child by its father's side, dived into the cabin, and soon reappeared with all he had asked for. Sitting down beside him, she mixed for him some brandy and water, and then began bathing his temples with eau de cologne, while he took hold of her other hand. \" Oh, w*hat good it does me,\" he said ; \" but not so much as feeling this dear hand once more in mine.\" \" Hubert \" \u2014 she began, and paused. \" Well, my love, what is it ? \" \" Hubert, it may be that we shall not see another day. Tell me that my wickedness is forgiven.\" \" Oh, Susan, can you doubt it ! Not that forgiveness ought to be mentioned between us, for I was at least as much to blame as you ; more so, perhaps, for I ought to have known \u2014 I did know \u2014 that what you said was occasioned by your love for me. But with me it was pride against love, and pride conquered. How you must have hated me at that time, Susan.\""], [243, "235 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" I loved you all the better. You were right to resent such an insult. A woman per haps might have been permitted to overlook it, but a man would have been degraded had he passed it over. And, Hubert,\" she continued hesitatingly, \" if it is the will of God that we should be saved, may I always live with you again ? \" \" Live with me again ! Of course. What could make you ask such a question ? \" \" Because you then said \u2014 \" \" Yes, I remember. I said no human power should ever make me live under the same roof with you again. It was a wicked vow to make ; it w*ould be still more wicked to keep it. But God himself has absolved me from it. It is no human power that has again united us. Do you not recognize, as I do, in the various seeming accidents that have brought us once more together, the direct interposition of Providence ? \" Susan assented, and then all further con versation ceased. Marston's voice had been gradually getting weaker, and he murmured out that he was again in too much pain to"], [244, "236 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. talk any more. Susan continued her gentle ministrations, and lavished on him every care that the loving heart of woman could suggest to soothe his sufferings. At last, to her great joy, his moaning ceased ; he closed his eyes, and fell into a doze. Every groan he had ut tered had gone to her heart : she felt his agonies more keenly than if she were enduring them herself, she watched anxiously for the first ap pearance of day, in the hope that it would bring relief for him ; but for herself and her child she felt no alarm. For the first time for many a long day her mind was at peace ; and in that blissful state of repose, sunk in a reverie of happiness, she kept her lonely watch, for getting that the lives of her husband, her child, and herself hung upon a thread. Slowly, very slowly passed away the hours of that December night, but at length the clear, pale moonlight gradually melted away, and morning dawned, cold and comfortless. The wind blew a little more briskly, and the heavy, lazy rolling of the ship seemed to indi cate that the sea was rising. \" Susan,\" said"], [245, "237 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Sir Hubert, \" it is now light. Is there any vessel in sight ? \" \" I did not think you were awake. Has your sleep refreshed you? \" \" Yes, dearest, much. But look out, and see what hope we have.\" She looked long and anxiously. \" No ; I see nothing. Yet stay, there is a speck \u2014 a mere speck on the horizon. Can it be a ship ? \" \" It can be nothing else,\" said her husband, trying, but in vain, to raise himself up. \" My darling, I cannot stir. It is hard that every thing should fall upon you, but there is no help for it. I must try to make a sailor of you. Bring me those signal halliards \u2014 those small ropes, I mean, tied to the rigging \u2014 and then bring me the ensign \u2014 the flag \u2014 you will find in that locker.\" He made it fast, the union downwards ; and then, under his instructions, she succeeded in running it up to the masthead. \" Do you see anything more of that vessel? \" he asked."], [246, "238 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. She strained her eyes to the utmost. \"No, nothing,\" she replied in a tone of bitter disappointment. \" It has disappeared.\" \"Better luck next time,\" he said with a sigh. The first bright rays of the morning sun came dancing to them on the crests of the waves, but, as if they had made their appear ance only in mockery, were soon hid in mist and fog. \" This is unlucky,\" observed Marston. \" Nevertheless, we must not die of hunger. If you will go to the cabin you will find a tongue and some biscuits. I am sure you must be starving. I know I am.\" When she came back with the provisions her face was as white as a sheet. \" Hubert, there is a great deal of water in the cabin. There was none when I went down before.\" \"That is bad news indeed,\" Marston re plied. \" But I cannot say I am surprised. For some time I have fancied by the motion of the vessel she was getting deeper in the water."], [247, "239 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Susan, if we are both to die \u2014 thank God we shall die in love and peace with each other.\" \" Yes, thank God for that. But my child \u2014 my treasure \u2014 \" \" Yes, it is hard upon him, poor little fellow; in our eyes at least. Is he baptized ? \" \" Yes, the Dean of Newport \u2014 \" At that moment a flaw of wind struck them, rolling up the fog like a curtain. \" A ship ! a ship ! \" she cried, without stop ping to finish her previous sentence. \"Where? How far off? Is she coming towards us ? \" asked Marston. \" A long wray off, but not so far as the other. I see her quite plain \u2014 sails and hull, and all. It seems as if she would cross us.\" \" Oh, if I could but drag myself forward.\" \" What for ? Tell me, and I will do it.\" \" You cannot. It is to fire off the gun that stands in the bows.\" \" Tell me how to do it.\" \" You do not know the risk you run. I saw it loaded yesterday with a very heavy"], [248, "240 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. charge of powder. The recoil will be very great ; it is an old gun, and it may burst.\" \" Risk ! \" she exclaimed. \" Do you think risk would stop me, with the lives of my hus band and child at stake ! If you could do it in safety, I can. Tell me how, Hubert, or I will try to do it alone, as I best can.\" He saw that she was in earnest, and more over it was their best, perhaps their last chance. He gave her the most minute directions for her own safety, which she promised to observe, and the feat wras accomplished. The explosion was tremendous, and the gun kicked itself over on its side. \" Are you hurt, Susan ? \" asked Marston, anxiously, as she stepped on to the poop with an unsteady gait, but he had to repeat the question before he obtained an answer. \" No dearest, only a little stunned. Was baby frightened ? \" \"Thank God, it is no worse. That will soon pass off. As for baby, I think he rather liked it. Does the ship make any signal ? \" \" Yes, oh yes. They have hoisted a flag !"], [249, "241 SIR HUBERT MARSTON And see, a little puff of smoke. What does that mean ? \" \" Hark ! and you will soon know.\" Before the words were out of his mouth, the report of a heavy gun came booming across the water. \" It is their answer. It means, my love, that they have heard us and see us, and are coming to our assistance.\" \" Saved ! Saved, my darling, my angel ! \" said Susan, clasping her child to her breast. \"Yes, saved,\" muttered her husband to himself; \"provided they are in time.\" He might well feel doubtful, for the Adeliza was evidently water-logged, and seemed to be settling. The stranger did ber best. She was a large steamer bound from Waterford to Bordeaux, and she came bowling down towards the wreck with all her steam on, and every sail set that w*ould draw. As she approached, her speed gradually slackened, and when within a couple of hundred yards she rounded to. In another minute a boat was lowered. The men saw that the case was urgent. They pulled with a will, and in a few minutes VOL. III. 16"], [250, "242 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. boarded the Adeliza. Sir Hubert was the first lowered into the boat. Then came his son's turn. Susan was very reluctant to trust him to the rough-looking sailor with thick, black whiskers, who volunteered to take charge of him, but his voice and words reassured her. \"Lord, Mann, don't you be afeard. I'll take as much care of him as if he wer' one of my own, the pretty little creetur.\" Master Marston was deposited uninjured beside his father. Susan followed, the boat was shoved off, and almost before she had time to realize the fact of their rescue, she found herself in safety with her husband and child on the deck of their new friend, the Pride of Erin. It was time. As the steamer forged ahead, Susan turned to take a last look at the unfortunate Adeliza. She saw her plunge forward till her bows were nearly buried ; then, as if appealing to Heaven for aid in her last desperate struggle for existence, she raised her stem on high, till great part of her keel was seen. In vain ! Helpless and abandoned by all, she was now delivered over"], [251, "243 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. to the power of the remorseless element, against which she had been successfully bat tling for so many years. Gradually she sunk, till at last the flag which Susan had hoisted, and which had so greatly contributed to their deliverance, alone was visible. For a moment it fluttered above the waves, and then disap peared for ever. To Susan it seemed as if she had witnessed the death of a dear friend. She gave way at last. Sinking on her knees, she burst into tears. Sir Hubert was taken below to the captain's cabin. It appeared that, in consequence, pro bably, of the exertions he had made in getting on board, the wound in his side had opened, and he had lost a good deal of blood. It had now ceased to flow, checked, no doubt, by the coldness of the night, but he was in a state of great exhaustion. Fortunately, there were some Sisters of Charity on board, on their way to China via Marseilles, and one of them, who had a fair share of surgical know ledge and skill, after visiting the sufferer, and replacing the bandages, assured Lady Mar-"], [252, "244 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. ston that there wras no danger to be appre hended ; and that, with proper care and good nursing, he would soon recover his strength. The Pride of Erin reached Bordeaux early on the following morning: the boats of the A deliza were never heard of. It seems certain that Captain Brownrig and Mr S. Penge, with the rest of their shipmates, found a grave beneath the billow's of the Atlantic. Sir Hubert and Lady Marston alone remained to tell the tale."], [253, "245 CHAPTER X. What Lady Marston's sensations were when she once more found herself in safety, walking beside her husband's litter with her child in her arms, on their way from the quay to the hotel, may be imagined. To pry into them would be irreverent. To attempt to describe them, desecration. But though all peril was over, her first day on shore was any thing but one of rest. Letters were to be written, servants to be engaged, every article \u2022of wearing apparel for herself, her husband, and her child to be bought \u2014 for they had lost all. Her first care, after seeing Sir Hubert comfortably installed in the apartments she had engaged, was to order a carriage and drive"], [254, "246 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. to the banker's, the landlady volunteering to remain in the room, and take care of the child. Amongst the other articles with which Mar ston had so providently filled his pockets, previous to leaving the Adeliza, was a bundle of circular notes to a considerable amount ; and he suggested to his wife that the corre- iOo spondent on whom they were drawn would be the very man to assist her in her difficulties. Nor was he mistaken. M. Chopin was at breakfast when she arrived, but as soon as he heard that a lady wished to see him on urgent business, he went down to receive her in dressing-gown and slippers, although bank hours had not yet commenced. She had hardly told her tale, and exhibited her cre dentials, before \u2014 influenced a little perhaps by the beauty of his client \u2014 he put himself en tirely at her disposal. He furnished her with the address of the surgeon most in repute at Bordeaux, gave her all the money she asked for without even taking an acknowledgment \u2014 he would have the honour of waiting on Milor in the course of the day, when they could set tle that little matter \u2014 and lastly he insisted"], [255, "247 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. upon taking her up-stairs to be introduced to Madame, who would be delighted to assist her in her various commissions. From the banker's she drove to the sur geon's, and carried him off in triumph from a crowd of patients, or rather impatients, who threatened to oppose his abduction vi et armis. The surgeon fully confirmed the Sister of Charity's opinion. There was no fever. Sir Hubert was only suffering from extreme weak ness. The best remedy was perfect rest and a generous diet. He particularly recom mended a liberal exhibition of Bordeaux, for which the hotel in which they had taken up their abode was justly celebrated. His bro ther was the wine-merchant who supplied it, and so he told them with an honest laugh, in which even Marston found strength to join, and which inspired Susan with immense con fidence in his professional skill. He then turned to Milddi, and told her that he should send a nurse, on whom she might depend, to assist her in tending her husband. At this Susan was inclined to rebel; but she gave way, when he said, \" As you please, Madame."], [256, "248 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Then I will send a wet-nurse for your child. You cannot do justice to both, and if you do not take care of yourself, you will have to put yourself also under my care. So much the better for me. I had always rather have two patients than one.\" As soon as he was gone, Susan prepared two telegrams, one to Caroline Marston and the other to Digby, and again sallied forth to take them herself to the office. She then re turned home, and after seeing her husband take a consomme with great apparent satisfaction, thought she had fairly earned a luncheon for herself. This was hardly concluded when M. and Mme Chopin were announced. Monsieur wras introduced to Sir Hubert's bedside, and received his bills for the money advanced ; and then the two ladies departed on a shopping expedition, Susan having seized upon all her husband's garments, notwith standing his remonstrances, that they might serve as a model for the fabrication of new ones to M. Chopin's tailor, an artiste de ce'le- Irite Parisienne, as that gentleman assured"], [257, "249 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. her. The work those two went through that afternoon was something passing belief, but Mme Chopin was quite in her element, and Susan was indefatigable. She was deter mined to do all she had to do ; and, as we know, when once she took a thing into her head, no one was more likely to carry it out. The most important acquisition she made was a bonne for the child, whom she carried home with her, and who, Mme Chopin assured her, was a perfect treasure. She also, at the same lady's recommendation, engaged a servant for Sir Hubert and a maid for herself, who w-ere to enter on their functions on the morrow. At length, thoroughly worn out, she returned home, but her labours were not yet over. Before the evening was far advanced, the nurse promised by the surgeon was announced, and all Marston's entreaties could not per suade her to seek the repose of which she stood so much in need, till she had satisfied herself that the new comer was perfectly com petent to the discharge of her duties. Of this there seemed to be no reason to doubt ;"], [258, "250 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. and when Susan had finished her examination and cross-examination, and given all the necessary instructions, she retired to her own room. \" And time I should,\" she said, as she stooped over her husband and kissed him, \" for I can hardly keep my eyes open. How ever, to-morrow I mean to devote to you, and baby, and idleness.\" In this she reckoned without her host. She woke to find herself famous. The story of their perils and escape had been spread far and near by the Chopins, the surgeon, and the captain of the steamer which had rescued them. At an early hour all Bordeaux knew that an Englishman of rank, who had been wounded in the Crimea, had been wrecked on his return home, and only saved from perish ing by the devotion and courage of his wife ; and by ten o'clock all the notabilities of the city were on foot to compliment their faithful allies. To the presence of the hero they were not admitted, but for that privation they were amply indemnified by contemplation of the heroine. Madame Chopin was the first to arrive, to inquire after Sare Marston, cette"], [259, "251 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. charmante Miledi, et ce cher petit. She men tioned the probability of Lady Marston's re ceiving some visits in the course of the morn ing, and Susan asked her to remain and assist her in doing' the honours ; a request with which that good lady cheerfully complied, delighted at the prospect of finding herself in the society of the creme de la creme of Bordeaux. First, as was but right, the English consul and con suless made their appearance ; they were fol lowed by the preset with madame ; then came in rapid succession the governor and the gene ral commanding the military division, with their respective staffs ; the archbishop, with his grand vicaire ; many of the principal inhabit ants, with a shoal of sous-presets and other sub ordinate officials. From all Susan received unlimited offers of service, and all departed enchanted with her beauty, her grace, and her courteous manners. \" Elle me'rite d'etre Fran gaise,\" was the universal observation. Could praise or adulation further go ! The reception lasted some hours, but at length it was over, and Madame Chopin took her leave. \" Now, my love,\" said her hus-"], [260, "252 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. band, \"come and sit down quietly, and tell me all about it.\" \"You must let me rest a little, dearest,\" was the reply, \" for I am more dead than alive. I declare I think I would rather pass another night on board the Adeliza than go through such a fatiguing scene again; and I speak French so badly.\" In a couple of days Sir blubert had suffi ciently recovered his strength to be moved into the sitting-room, and Susan determined in her own mind that the time had arrived for clearing up the mystery of her residence at Highbeach. It was rather an embarrassing disclosure to make, but made it must be sooner or later, and that being the case the sooner the better. \" You never have asked me any thing about the lady with whom I have been passing the last six months,\" she said, one evening. \" Do you not care to know ? \" \" How can I ever thank her, Susan, as I wish to do, without knowing her name and place of abode ? If I have not asked you about her, it has been from no want of interest,"], [261, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 253 or even curiosity, but because I knew you would tell me in your own good time, and I had no wish to force your confidence.\" \" Oh, Hubert, what a phrase ! But if you like I will tell you all now*.\" That Sir Hubert's surprise was great when he heard the tale his wife had to tell is certain, that his annoyance, in the first instance at least, was also great, when he discovered that the person to whom his wife, and through his wife he also, wras so deeply indebted, was Caroline Marston, may fairly be conjectured ; but before Susan had concluded her narrative all trace of it had vanished. \" Well, certain ly,\" he said, \" the last year has been fruitful in the most extraordinary adventures 'for both of us. With regard to Caroline, I have long ceased to have any feelings towards her except those of good-will. I have no doubt that when she broke off our engagement she did what was best for both of us. For me most certainly. Her first marriage was an error, to say the least of it ; but I am delighted to hear that she is likely to find in a second the"], [262, "254 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. happiness I most sincerely wish her. From the little I saw of the Dean, but still more from what I have heard of him, I think she has made a most judicious choice. Pray, when you write, offer them both my most cor dial congratulations ; and tell Caroline that I shall not be happy till I have obtained her permission to thank her in person, on my return to England, for all her kindness to you.\" After this speech Susan breathed more freely ; and with the confidence of a child con fessing her little escapades to an indulgent mother, by degrees she narrated to him all that had occurred to her since their parting in London. Nor was Marston less candid. He told her of the agonies he had endured when her flight was first discovered, and her fate unknown. He acknowledged that it was in a sort of despair that he had embarked for the Crimea, that, had he not parted with all his property at the Cape, in all probability he w*ould have returned to his Caffres and Hot tentots, and renounced England for ever. And then he related his meeting with Lord Dept-"], [263, "255 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. ford after the battle of the Alma, and every particular of the conversation he had held with his nephew, while the latter was on his death-bed. Together they wept over his fate, together they deplored the loss of that true and unselfish friend, who, even in the agonies of death, had shown himself so mindful of the happiness and welfare of those he loved. With Marston's youth and strong constitu tion he made rapid progress, and every day was marked by decided amendment. Soon he was able to go out in a carriage, and Susan began to look wistfully to the time when he would be pronounced sufficiently recovered to proceed on their homeward journey. But he was so strongly advised not to face an English winter till his health was completely restored, that they made up their minds to remain where they were till the spring. A large villa was taken in the neighbourhood of Bordeaux, and there they installed themselves for the next few months. But not in solitude. In addition to the flying visits of their Bordeaux friends, many of their own relations came over from England"], [264, "256 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. to pass a few weeks with them. Their ad ventures had become a sort of public property ; and under the head of \" Romance in fashion able life,\" the newspapers had informed their readers of the fortuitous meeting of Lady Marston with her husband at Malta, when she was so far on her way to the Crimea to nurse him; their embarkation on board the Adeliza, the loss of that vessel, and their rescue by the Irish steamer. The facts had been furnished by Digby, who thought the op portunity a good one for obliterating from the not very retentive memory of society all recol lection of their previous estrangement. It is needless to say that Digby's facts were con siderably embellished and improved upon by our public instructors, before they were sub mitted to the judgment of their readers ; and by all Lady Marston's conduct, her courage, her presence of mind, her self-sacrificing de votion, were extolled to the skies, and pointed out to the admiration of the world at large. And the world, which must have its idol, and is thankful to have it pointed out without the trouble of discovery, admired accordingly."], [265, "257 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. This publicity was anything but agreeable to the object of it, but it had the good effect of putting an end to all the idle stories, that had been circulated by Lady Deptford and others to her disadvantage. Even Mr Penrhys did not venture a sneer against one, who w*as placed by public acclamation on a level with Joan of Arc, or Grace Darling, or any other heroine of times ancient or modern. If this was the effect on the public at large, it was still greater on Marston's immediate friends and relations. As soon as he could hold a pen he had written to Digby, the Winder- meres, the Berries, and even the Dean of Newport, in such terms of his wife as nothing but the tenderest and most grateful affection could dictate. To his nieces and their hus- bands he gave an invitation to pass the win- ter, or as much of it as suited them, in his villa ; and this invitation, under the circum- stances, they considered as a sort of royal command. For, there was that in Sir Hubert's character, a firmness and decision, a good sense and sound judgment, honesty of pur pose, and inviolable adherence to his word, VOL. III. 17"], [266, "258 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. united to uncompromising support of all who had a fair claim to his assistance, which not only made him respected as the head of his own family, but looked up to as a sort of feudal chieftain, to whom all connected with him owed allegiance. In other days he would have had a following almost as formidable as that of the King-maker. The villa of the Marstons, therefore, was seldom without guests during the winter months. From both Sir Hubert and Susan the Digbys received the most pressing invita tions to come to them, if but for a few days. But to this appeal Digby alone responded, and he remained only eight-and-forty hours. Susan was really vexed when she saw him arrive alone. \" You may tell Lucy,\" she said, \" that I did not think she would have been so unkind. I have half a mind to say I will never forgive her.\" \" That would be unjust, Susan ; for she desired me to say that nothing but the most urgent business would have prevented her accompanying me.\""], [267, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 259 \" Urgent business ! What nonsense ! what urgent business can she have ? \" Digby smiled. \" You don't mean to say that she is expect ing another confinement ? \" \" I really cannot take upon me to say. It may be something of that sort ; but Lucy does not let me into her secrets. All I know is that she gave me to understand that it would be as much as my place is worth, if I were not back by Monday.\" \" Why this will be the third in four years. Only fancy ! How many more does she mean to have, I wonder ! \" At length, Marston threw off his invalid state altogether. His cure was complete; and in the first days of May he returned with his wife to England. They had neither of them any wish to join in the gaieties of the season, and their intention was, after some days spent in London, to go straight to Thornwood, and have a few weeks entirely to themselves. A day or two before their departure, Marston said to his wife \u2014"], [268, "260 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" By-the-by, Susan, there is a visit we ought to pay before we go to Yorkshire. What do you say to running down to High beach for a day ? \" \" Dearest Hubert, will you indeed go with me ? I meant to petition for leave to go down there to-morrow with baby, but you do not know how happy it will make me to have you with us. And it will please Caroline too.\" \" Are you so sure of that ? \" \" Quite sure. I know she has a great re gard for you, and I mean you to love her.\" \" How much, Lady Marston ? \" asked Sir Hubert, laughing. \" Oh, as much as you please,\" she replied, with a conscious blush. \" I leave that entirely to you.\" They arrived next day at Highbeach ; and Susan, preceding her husband a little, entered the sitting-room, in which Caroline Marston was arranging some flowers, without being announced. Stealing up to her sister-in-law unperceived, she put her hands over her eyes. \" Guess,\" she said. \" Susan, dearest Susan, is it indeed you ?"], [269, "261 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. I was just thinking when I should hear from you again.\" \" Yes, dearest, Susan large as life, and not alone. I have brought you a visitor \u2014 two, indeed, for baby has come as well as his papa.\" \" Sir Hubert ! \" exclaimed Caroline, as Marston appeared at the door. \" Yes, Caroline,\" he said. \"A brother come to thank a sister for kindness shown to his wife.\" \" Kiss her, Hubert ! \" cried Susan, mag nanimously; \" for if I am less unworthy of your love, it is to her I owe it all.\" It cost her an effort, no doubt, to make such a speech. Sir Hubert took immediate advantage of the suggestion, and the opera tion was successfully performed, though it certainly did not diminish the confusion of the kissee. The child, however, fortunately made his appearance in the very nick of time, and being transferred to his aunt's arms, enabled her to recover her composure. Soon after, Dr Crossby was announced, and as the conversa tion became more general, all embarrassment gradually ceased."], [270, "262 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Well, Caroline,\" said the Dean, when the first greetings and enquiries were over, \" have you informed Lady Marston of our plans ? \" \" Not yet,\" she replied. \" Time enough for that, when we have heard all Susan's ad ventures.\" \"No, no,\" said Susan. \"Tell me what you are going to do. My letters have told you all I have been about since I left High beach.\" Caroline hesitated, and looked at the Dean. \" I see she means to throw it all upon me,\" said that dignitary. \" In short, we are to be married to-morrow, in the quietest way possi ble ; but I am sure I am speaking Caroline's sentiments as well as my own, when I say that, if we can prevail upon you and Sir Hubert to accompany us to the church, you will confer on us not only honour, but a real favour.\" \" Of course we will,\" exclaimed Susan and her husband, \u2014 while the latter asked who was to give Caroline away. \" Dr Baird has been good enough to say that he would undertake that office,\" replied"], [271, "263 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. the Dean. \"It appears none of her family are able, or willing, to come.\" \" I have the greatest respect for Dr Baird,\" said Marston ; \" but on the present occasion his claims must give way to mine. As your nearest relative present, Caroline, I claim the privilege of giving you away. When I see the Doctor I will make him my excuses for usurping his office.\" \" Who is talking of the Doctor ? \" said the individual in question, entering the room. \"Lady Marston, as I am a sinner, or her double ! Has your ladyship dropped from heaven, or sprang from the depths of the sea, to take us all by surprise ? How well you are looking ! I need not ask after your health.\" \" Quite well, thank God ; and so is baby too, though you have quite overlooked him. But, Dr Baird, you must allow me to intro duce you to my scarecrow, Sir Hubert Mar ston.\" Marston shook hands with him, and thanked him most cordially for all the care and atten tion he had bestowed on his wife."], [272, "264 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" But I should like to know,\" he continued, \" why I am introduced to you as her scare- crow.\" \" Oh, an unlucky speech of mine ; and I am sorry I cannot congratulate Lady Marston on her good nature as well as on her good looks. I trust, however, her clemency is on a par with her memory, and that she will forgive, if she cannot forget. And now let me have a look at the young gentleman, and see if he can recognize an old friend.\" \" If he could speak, Doctor,\" said Susan, \" he would tell you that mamma is now sur rounded by the four persons on earth to whom she owes the most.\" Caroline Marston was married on the fol lowing day ; and Marston, as he gave her away, and compared the calm complacency with which he performed that paternal office with the feelings which he had once enter tained for her, could not refrain from a smile at the inconsistency of the human heart. After the ceremony, they all returned to the cottage for a hurried breakfast, and then separated for their respective destinations."], [273, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 265 The Dean and Mrs Crossby \u2014 she dropped the title and name she had acquired by her first marriage \u2014 proposed making a short tour to the Lakes, before settling dow-n at the Deanery, and promised to pay the Marstons a visit at the Priory on their way south. The house at Highbeach was given up as a matter of course, one of the servants being left in it to pack and forward the furniture under Dr Baird's supervision. That learned gentleman either did, or professed to, feel himself greatly aggrieved by this complete disruption of his habits and intimacies. But his lamentations met with but little attention. He received general and, what is not always the case, sin cere invitations to Thornwood and the Dean ery ; and was told that it would he entirely his own fault if he did not avail himself of them. Sir Hubert went the length of hinting to him that it was just possible Lady Marston would require his professional services before the end of the year, in w*hich case no excuse would be taken, as she always asserted that she had no confidence in any one but Dr Baird. The Marstons themselves prepared to re-"], [274, "266 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. turn to London, but before their departure Susan took her husband to be introduced to Mrs Clarke. He made that good lady happy by the praises he bestowed upon the Sergeant major. He told her that, but for the gallantry of her husband and the handful of brave men with him, in all probability his own bones would now be rotting in the valley of Inker mann. As a proof of his gratitude, he furnished her with the means of setting up a milliner's shop, which to the present day is the pride and ornament of the market-place of High beach. All debts of friendship and gratitude being thus duly paid, Sir Hubert and Susan left Highbeach, with the intention of starting for the North, as soon as their preparations could be completed. They had already taken leave of the Digbys, and all their other belongings. One visit alone still remained to be paid. Fanny Digby had hitherto shrunk from an in terview she dreaded and desired, but she had promised to meet them at her brother's on the last day of their stay in town. It was a bitter trial to her \u2014 a renewal of all her grief \u2014 to find"], [275, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 267 herself in the presence of one who had received her lover's last sigh, who had been the deposi tary of his last words, who was the bearer of his last gift. But, like most other earthly sorrows, it bore within itself the germ of consolation.

From this consolation she had hitherto been debarred.

Her brother"], [276, "268 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. and Lucy felt for her ; but he was too much occupied with his business, which was increas ing every day, and she was too much occupied with family cares, to have much time to bestow on her. Mrs Fleming was residing with her husband's family in Scotland. Her other sis ters loved her and pitied her. They quite understood that the death of a lover was a serious, a very serious loss, but they were too young and light-hearted to understand perma nent sorrow. Their doctrine was, that there were as good fish in the sea as had ever come out of it, and they thought that Fanny would act more sensibly if \u2014 now that a decent time had elapsed since Lord Deptford's death \u2014 she Avere to set about replacing him. But with the Marstons it was different. Her grief, so long compressed in her own breast, softened, now that she was able to give full vent and expression to her feelings, and she found a melancholy pleasure in dwelling upon the numerous instances of her lover's worth with those who were so well able to ap preciate it. \"And now, Fanny,\" said Lady Marston,"], [277, "269 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. rising to depart, \" w*e have a proposal to make, and if you care for us, if you cherish dear Deptford's memory, you must accept it. You know Hubert and I loved him as a brother ; be to us a sister. Come to Thornwood with us, not on a visit, but to live with us entirely. We shall lead a very retired life for some time to come, but you shall be your own mistress at all times, with your owrn apartment, your own servant, and, if you prefer it, we will have nothing in common, except the roof that covers us. Say you accept. A London life cannot be agreeable to you now. Come to Thorn wood where our dear friend is buried. By so doing you will make us both very happy, and I am sure it is an arrangement poor Deptford would have approved.\" Sir Llubert joined his entreaties to those of his wife. No proposal could have been more pleasing to Miss Digby. If she hesitated, it was because she recoiled from throwing such a burthen upon her friends. \" Give me time to reflect,\" she said. \" When my brother and Lucy go to Thorn wood, I have promised to accompany them."], [278, "270 SIR HUBERT MARSTON.

But these inevitable troubles fall all the more lightly on those who, like Susan and her husband, unite in bearing them together, inspiring each other with fortitude and resignation. Before long the most perfect community of thought and"], [280, "0 70 Ml *.' SIR HUBERT MARSTON. feeling, the most entire confidence reigned between them ; and it seemed more like an un easy dream than a reality, when they looked back to the days of their temporary separation. It took some little time, however, to establish this state of things. Notwithstanding all her husband's attentions and expressions of affec tion, notwithstanding her own conviction that she was dearer to him than ever, Susan brooded over the recollection of her transgressions with morbid sensitiveness. The first excitement consequent on their escape, perhaps the con sciousness that to her exertions their safety was mainly due, had erased for a time these pain ful thoughts from her mind ; but in their soli tude at Thornwood they returned with re doubled force, filling her with a sense of the bitterest humiliation. She felt no confidence in herself, or in the good resolutions she had formed. Without being aware of it herself, she assumed a lowliness of demeanour little in accordance with her position as a wife, a mother, or the mistress of a household. She never gave an order on her own responsibility ; everything, however trivial, was referred to Sir Hubert's decision ; by degrees the servants"], [281, "273 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. almost ceased to consult her, and the estab lishment did not go on the better for it. In her husband's presence she exerted herself to be cheerful, but the effort was visible ; and when she spoke, the words dropped from her lips as if she were weighing them, to make sure that they contained no cause of offence. Marston was grieved to the soul by the dejec tion which she could not always hide, and of which he partly guessed the reason, but he was powerless to remove it. Expostulation might make matters worse. She was so gentle, so patient, so grateful for the most trifling en dearment, that he could not bear the thought of possibly adding to her distress by any allu sion to their past dissensions. Thus matters stood when the Dean of New port and his wife came to pay their promised visit. Caroline, writh female intuition, saw at a glance that something was wrong, and was not long before she discovered the why and the wherefore. She determined to take her sister-in-law to task on the first opportunity, and it was not long in coming. \" How do you think Hubert looking, Caro- VOL.

He looks anxious and unhappy, and to tell you the truth I am not surprised at it. He asks for your confidence and love, and the re turn you make him is to treat him as if you are afraid of him.\" \" Has he been talking to you about it ? \" said Susan, with a flash of her former spirit. \" Talking to me ! No. Depend upon it, Sir Hubert has too much delicacy of feeling to make me or any one else the confidant of his domestic troubles. What I said is the result of my own observations. To see you together, one might suppose that you have a brute for a husband, who beats you morning and night, and into whose presence you never venture except in fear and trembling. Think what an impression it must make even upon the serv ants. Of course he is hurt by it.\" \" Oh, Caroline, what can I do ? You know not how* unhappy I feel.\" Thereupon Mrs Crossby opened up the whole question, and discussed it so thoroughly,"], [283, "275 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. seasoning her observations with such judicious advice, that Susan could not but acknowledge that she w*as right, and promised to do her best to conquer the diffidence and restraint with which she had hitherto met her husband's advances. \" But, Caroline,\" she said, \" how can I ever banish from my memory those wicked words I uttered against him ! \" \" If you still recollect them, dearest,\" said Mrs Crossby, \" recollect also that the best way to show your sorrow for them, and your grati tude for his generous forgiveness, is to accept it frankly and unreservedly, in the same spirit in which it is given.

And he is not happy now.\" \" Honestly and truly, Caroline, do you think his happiness is in my power ? \" \" Honestly and truly, I believe it to be in your power, and yours only.\" \" Then I will do my best.\" She kept her word, and found the task an easier one than she had fancied. Under her new system she saw her husband's spirits rise day by day, and, as Caroline had predicted,"], [284, "276 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. her own kept pace with them. Before the Crossbys left Thornwood, they had the plea sure of seeing confidence and the familiarity of married life completely re-established be tween their hosts. Susan actually found her self one evening at dessert flirting a drop of w*ater into Marston's face, when he did not pay immediate attention to some observation she had made. \" Take care, Susan,\" he said. \" Remember our water-fight at Mrs Tindal's.\" \" I remember you had not the best of it,\" she replied, with a merry laugh at the recol lection. Sir Hubert Marston, to his friend Digby 's great indignation, refused more than once an invitation to stand for the county ; but his life was far from an idle one. He was useful and respected as a magistrate, as a sportsman, and as a practical farmer. His lands bore the heaviest crops ; his meadows pastured the fin est, not the fattest, beasts ; his farm-buildings were in the best order ; his labourers' cottages the most convenient throughout all that coun try-side. When he presided on the bench, the most notorious poacher was sure of jus-"], [285, "277 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. tice ; when the hounds drew his coverts, they were sure of a find ; and when his friends came to see him, they were sure of a cordial welcome. That Lady Marston did her part in the good work was universally acknowledged, but her influence was felt rather than seen, for she carefully kept herself in the back-ground, de riving an honest pride from the estimation in which the husband she loved was held by all who knew him, high and low alike. But her popularity was not inferior to his own, and their poorer neighbours were unanimous in declaring, that the reign of Queen Susan deserved as honourable mention in their annals as that of Queen Caroline. The Marstons went every year for two or three months to London, but by far the great est part of their time was spent at Thornwood. Soon after the peace they made a pilgrimage to the Crimea, where Susan visited with the deepest interest all the scenes of the sanguin ary struggle just brought to so unsatisfactory a conclusion ; lingering long upon the spot where Lord Deptford had received his death wound, and that which her husband had dyed"], [286, "278 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. with his blood. Nor was the public garden at Malta forgotten. Again they sat together on the same bench, but they were no longer an invalided husband and a mourning wife. The stalwart arm that was thrown around Susan was as able, as it was willing, to shield her from harm, and the tears that sprung to her eyes were tears of gratitude and unutterable happiness. They paid also a visit to Harry Ashford's widow in Scotland ; and in the following year she passed a couple of months at Thornwood. But somehow or other the two sisters-in-law did not amalgamate. Mrs Ashford was of a restless disposition, whose whole happiness seemed to consist in moving about. Hav ing passed the greatest part of her unmarried life abroad, she could not accommodate herself to England, or things English. In the fourth year of her widowhood, she married a man old enough to be her father, who held a high civil appointment in India. As it was very unde sirable to take out her little son with her, she thankfully accepted Sir Hubert's offer to take charge of him altogether ; and since that time"], [287, "279 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. young Harry Ashford, who was a few weeks older than Susan's first-born, has found a very happy home at Thornwood. Fanny Digby, after a little amicable discus sion, accepted Susan's proposal to set up her household gods at the Priory, and since her advent has never slept under another roof. She has recovered her cheerfulness, but her high spirits have fled for ever. She has never married, and in all probability never will. But she finds plenty to do. Under the denomination of Aunt Fanny, she ex ercises supreme authority in the school-room, and has great weight in the nursery.

He always left the Priory with a protest in his mouth : .\" Now, Lady Marston, this must positively be the last time, or you must look out for some one else to attend you.\" For those who are tolerant of noise and mirth, Christmas is the time to see Thorn wood in its glory. There is a regular gather ing of the clans at that season, and though the accommodation is great, it is strained to the utmost. The number of children espe cially is prodigious ; Marstons, Digbys, Ber trams, Berties, and Crossbys. All enjoying themselves immensely, with hockey, skating, sliding, hoops, balls of every size and colour, in the morning ; round-games, dancing, love making, quarrelling, and osculatory reconcilia tions, in the evening. It is the prettiest scene in the world ; but perhaps the most amusing part of the whole business is to listen to the mammas complimenting each other, profess ing to consider the children that are not their own as the most perfect specimens they have seen, the beau ideal of what a child ought to"], [289, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 281 be, \u2014 with a strong mental reservation all the time in favour of their own flesh and blood. There is one member of the Marston family who is not invited to join these annual meet ings. Lady Deptford's feud with her brother went on from bad to worse. Not contented with the indulgence which she had extended to Mr Penrhys' attacks upon Sir Hubert and Susan, and which had already put a stop to all intercourse betw-een her and most of the members of her own family, on occasion of the duel she openly took Penrhys' defence. She affected to consider him as a martyr to her cause, and threw all the blame on his antagonist, deploring alternately her brother's violence, and his weakness in allowing himself to be so completely hood-winked by his artful wife. This completed the rupture, and from that time everything went wrong with her. First on her list of grievances was Susan's confinement, and the birth of an heir to Thorn wood, which effectually put an end to the hopes she entertained of securing it, if not for herself, at least for her family ; hopes which late events had greatly tended to revive and"], [290, "282 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. strengthen. Some of her intimates called upon her, not exactly sure whether they ought to offer compliments of congratulation or condolence. She did not say much, but she gave them the cue, which wras all they wanted. \" Ah, my dear, it is a sad business alto gether. If my poor brother is satisfied no one has a right to say a word, but I own I have not the courage to write to congratulate him.\" To which the chorus replied, \" Very sad ! very shocking, indeed ! Then came the news of her son's death, announced to her by Sir Hubert in a letter full of affection and feeling. At such a time he would not recollect that any cause of quarrel existed between him and his only sister. Unluckily for her, Mr Penrhys called upon her as soon as he heard of the calamity which had befallen her, and as he had no wish to see a peace concluded, which would deprive him of his firmest ally, he persuaded her to reply in the coldest and most formal terms. He even contrived to obtain the insertion of a"], [291, "283 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. postscript which he knew w*ould annoy his enemy beyond measure. It ran thus : \u2014 \" Everybody is asking me if it is your in tention to recognize the child of which Lady Marston has just been confined, and I should be glad to know what answer I am to make.\" Lady Deptford was no fool, although she walked with open eyes into the trap laid for her. But in her defence it must be said that, at that time, she hardly knew what she was writing. She had not much depth of feeling ; she certainly could not be said to have much maternal affection for her children, but all she had was centred on the son she had lost. To this must be added pecuniary disap pointment. In another year Lord Deptford would have been in a position to fulfil the promise he had made of increasing her in come ; now she would have to wait another seven or eight years for Charlie's coming into full possession of his property, and moreover Charlie had made no promise at all. Then, to her great disgust, she heard that Miss Digbyhad assumed quasi widow's mourn-"], [292, "284 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. ing. Deptford's engagement had been a very sore subject, although, after her first remon strance with him, finding him determined, she had never ventured upon a second. How she could have found out anything about Miss Digby or her mourning is an enigma, for poor Fanny never stirred out of the house for weeks ; but know it she did, and she gave full vent to her indignation. \" Such presumption, such impertinence ! Who is Miss Digby, I should like to know, to give herself such airs ! I dare say my poor boy amused himself with her, but if it had pleased God to spare his life, depend upon it he would never have given her a second thought.\" But her wrath knew no bounds when she found that Lord Deptford had left Miss Digby nearly all he had to leave. She felt half in clined to dispute the will, but met with no encouragement from those whom she consulted on the subject, and soon her thoughts were turned in another direction. Her brother's severe wound suggested to her active mind the possibility of obtaining the guardianship of his child in case of his death, or, to use the"], [293, "285 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. proper phrase, in case of anything happening to him. To effect this, it would be necessary to obtain good and substantial proof of the mother's misconduct, and to this laudable object all her energies were directed; when all at once the world rang with the story of the romantic adventures of Sir Hubert and his wife, the perils to which they had been ex posed, and their miraculous escape. In despair she abandoned all her planning and plotting, and submitted to her fate. The current of public opinion ran too strongly in Susan's favour to attempt to struggle against it. She even thought it expedient, unknown to Pen rhys, to make overtures to her brother, which might lead to a renewal of intercourse between them. She wrote to him at Bordeaux, to congratulate him upon his safety, with a few civil words for his wife, but her last effusion still rankled in. his mind, and all she gained by this man\u0153uvre was two lines from Susan, to say that her husband had desired her to acknowledge the receipt of Lady Deptford's letter, as he was still too weak to write himself."], [294, "286 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Her relations with her married daughters were not on a much more comfortable footing. They greeted her civilly whenever they met, and relaxed so far as to call on her occasionally, with the distinct understanding, however, that they were not to be exposed to the chance of meeting Mr Penrhys. Edith, being still under her mother's control, was obliged to submit to that gentleman's society, but she made no secret of the detestation in which she held him, and her intention of effecting her eman cipation at the earliest possible opportunity. And yet it was to her that he at last owed the success of the projects which he had long entertained on Lady Deptford's hand, which was achieved in this wise : \u2014 Miss Edith, or, to give her her proper designa tion, Miss Wilmington, \u2014 who I may observe en passant turned out exceedingly pretty, with a slight, graceful figure, rather below the middle size, \u2014 after long and anxious delibera tion, selected matrimony, as the best means of escaping from Mr Penrhys' obsession. Ac cordingly, soon after she had completed her seventeenth year, she graciously permitted"], [295, "287 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Lord Henry Langley, who was one year older than herself, to drive her one morning in his cab to Islington, in which locality he had been residing for some time past, and married him then and there in the parish church, \u2014 their banns having been previously published with all proper formalities. This it was which at last encouraged Mr Penrhys to make his pro posals to Lady Deptford. Isolated from her nearest relations, standing as it were alone in the world, with a very troublesome son to manage, with a large acquaintance, \u2014 many intimates, but no friends, \u2014 she was now, with out much difficulty, persuaded to link her fate to that of the faithful counsellor, who for so many years had, from whatever motives, de voted himself with exemplary zeal and great intelligence to the furtherance of her interests. Nor can it be said that she has ever had cause to repent her decision. Mr Penrhys treats her with uniform attention and respect, w*hile the addition of his income to her own jointure raised her to the affluence for which she had long sighed. It is true that her marriage severed the last ties which still existed between"], [296, "288 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. her and the different members of her family, and was far from meeting with general appro bation ; but this did not affect her much. As her husband lost his seat at the next general election, and London no longer possessed any attractions for either of them, they emigrated to Paris, where they keep a very agreeable house, and are universally well received. In one particular, however, Lady Deptford met with grievous disappointment. She had never been able to extract from her son any thing like a promise to make an addition to her income. That noble lord was not cast in the same mould with his elder brother. He had no idea of curtailing his own pleasures for the sake of any one ; and when the marriage of Lady Deptford and Mr Penrhys was an nounced, he gladly seized the opportunity of declaring that, out of respect to his father's memory, he must decline parting with a single shilling which would find its way into the pockets of his unworthy successor. As some slight indemnification, Lady Deptford retained for her own proper use the interest"], [297, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 289 of Edith's fortune \u2014 about three hundred a-year \u2014 during the remaining years of her minority. \" How stingy of mamma!\" was that young lady's exclamation, when informed of her mother's intention. And no wonder she felt aggrieved, for Lady Deptford was nowrich; and in a pecuniary point of view, her own marriage was certainly not a brilliant one. Lord Henry Langley was the youngest brother of the Duke of Lowestoff, a cornet in the Life-Guards, with five hundred a-year besides his pay, and no further expectations. In short, in the eyes of the world, it would have been impossible for them to have been guilty of a greater act of folly. And yet a happier, a more light hearted, and unselfish couple it would be difficult to find ; always satisfied and looking at the bright side of things ; in love with each other, and popular with all who know them. They have no children, and neither Lady Henry nor her husband seem to regret it. \" What should I do with a child ? \" she once said. \" I should try to be a good mother, VOL.

With Illustrations from Original Drawings, and Photographs on Steel and Wood. Second Edition. 2 Vols. Demy Svo. 24^. \" This is a remarkable and very original book. The author is a shrewd and skilful observer, and a graphic and amusing writer. The familiar incidents of Oiiental travel seem novel and piquant as they are successively handled by Mr. Dixon, and he succeeds admirably in combining \u25a0a multitude of petty details into a connected whole. These volumes will throw a new light on the facts and the accessories of many a scene of Biblical history. The writer has discreetly avoided controversy of every kind, and ranks himself among the believers in the Sacred Story. In many places he reminds us of M. Kenau's famous romance ; but there is the all important difference that he accepts the scriptural narratives without doubt or criticism. His great object seems to have been to throw a new human and modern interest over the familiar details of the Bible. Thus he recasts into modern form many of the scriptural stories (which he is very fond of calling 'idyls'), and adonis them with all those details of place, and colour, and costume, and manners, and customs, which would be found in a narrative of our own day. In this he is generally very successful ; and we doubt not that his volumes will become great favourites with many people for Sunday reading, and that, to untravelled students, his descrip tions will be highly instructive as well as entertaining.\" \u2014 Saturday Review.

We do not forget that in his ' Month in Yorkshire ' he has written one of the best books of home travel in our language, and that he has shown Englishmen they need not go abroad in search of beautiful or sublime scenery.\" \u2014 London Review.
