THE interest inspired in France, and in almost the whole of Europe by the important question proposed by the National Institute on the re sults of the reformation of the church in the sixteenth century, is a sufficient proof that ours is not entirely devoid of that natural sentiment which makes us feel so lively an interest in the cause of religion/and in that of the perfection ment of our species. Doubtless this interest would have been mani fested in a still more positive manner, if, since the period in which the Institute made its judgment known, and in which it was given in an equally liberal manner, the public attention had not"], [20, "VIII been diverted from such subjects by a succession ol superior events of- a-.-peiitical nature, and which must have absorbed it entirely. But for them, it is perhaps allowable to suppose that this period would have become memorable in the history of opinion, and would not have been without some happy results. Since thet.appearaueQ of this work, several estimable voices have been raised in support of the principles of the love of truth announced in it. In a short time I hope will be added to them that of M. Leulwtle, profeslbr of the central school of Versailles, whose eloquent dis course, honoured with the approbation of the Institute,, is about to be printed, ,\"T\u00bb 1 S Another competitor, who alio received bo- X* ' nourable mention, has already published his work, on the merits of whicli it does not belong to me to decide. We differ in many capital points relative, to the essence of reformations, and of the intellectual or moral culture of nations.: I \u25a0 leave to the readers who chuse to enter into a serious examination of this question, the right of judging for themselves. But as 1\\I. Male ville seems to announce in his preface that he .has only -published his wcik to counteract mine, and with -a view to- controversy ; I must. observe that he has wholly misrepresented nty"], [21, "IX principal idea, in advancing that I had under taken to prove \"that before thejixteenth century, almost all Europe was still plunged in darkness and barbarism, and that the greater part of the ameliorations which have supervened, whether in the political situation of nations, or in the sciences and the arts, are awing lo Luther's reformation.'''' Certainly, far from maintaining that know ledge had sprung from the reformation, I have, on the contrary, uniformly shown how the re formation arose from that knowledge which had been gradually propagated for more than a cen tury. \" Daughter of reviving knowledge, the reformation must, doubtless, have been favour able to its progress.\" This phrase forms as it were the text of all I have said on the subject. Besides, I have plainly shown how many causes had contributed to the development of Eu ropean civilization during the middle age; I have not disguised the influence which the uni versal sovereignty of the popes, the crusades, the invention of artillery, that of printing, the discovery of the new world, and the renovation of knowledge may have exercised, and I have confined myself to placing the reformation of Luther among these influencing causes. To misrepresent the opinions which are intended to"], [22, "X be refuted, to exaggerate them, to give them a ridiculous extension, which never entered the mind of their author, is the meanest as well as the most unjust mode of procedure. Another writer whose person and object I esteem, M. de Laverne, in a Letter which ho has published and done me the honour to ad dress to me, has offered objections, more solid and of a superior description, against my opi nion. In that letter are passages strongly con ceived. It also contains assertions which I be lieve I could refute, were this the place to do so. For example, the synthetic unity of the philosophy of Kant is not applicable to the pumerical unity, nor to the physical unity of one person or one article, as M. Laverne seems to think. The religious unity meant by Kant, that sought by the understanding, and which has nothing in common with the senses, is only the unity of adoration, of charity, of morality, in short, the unity of the gospel among all Christians ; by no means that of the court of Home. Thus the unity of civil society con sists in the union of all its members for one common purpose, in the equality of all in the eyes of the law, but not in the individual and physical unity of a monarch ; this would be a strange mistake. The author of the Letter ap- 3"], [23, "XI pears to profess a particular veneration for Mt de St. Martin, a philosopher very deserving of this sentiment, and to whom the indifference op his countrymen but too well justified the ap pellation of the unknown, which he placed at the head of his books. In the last which he pulSilhed, intituled Le minijilre de I'homme esprit, I shall request M. de Laverne to read again what this observer, so religious, and so well informed, has said on Catholicism opposed to Christianity, (page 367, et seq.) Let me be permitted to quote some passages of it here: \"True Christianity is not only anterior to Ca \" tholicism, but also to the name of Christianity \" itself.....\" \" Christianity is the domain of freedom and \" of liberty: Catholicism is only the seminary \" of Christianity; it is the domain of the rules \" and discipline of conversion \" \" Christianity fills all the earth equally with \" the spirit of God. Catholicism fills only one \" part of the globe.....\" \" Christianity dilates and extends the use of \" our intellectual faculties. Catholicism con '\" tracts and circumscribes the exercise of these * lame faculties.\" \" Christianity has excited no war except"], [24, "XII ** against fin : Catholicism has excited it against \"men, &c...\" Now, it was against Catholicism, and in fa- vour os true Christianity that the reform was undertaken. I shall not speak of other critiques, dictated by false zeal and an unhappy spirit of party. Little surprised at the abuse they contain, I was only astonished at their singular weakness in facts and reasons. It would certainly have been easy to have made better by copying Arnauld and Bossuet, or even Maimbourgh and Farillas ; while,on the other side, it would have been very easy to have answered them by copying, in turn, Lenfant, Jurieu, Bar/le, and other con- trovertists or historians of the reform. Nearly every thing has been said, for and against, on this great disquisition, and the controversy might without difficulty be renewed with a parade of profound erudition on both fides. But there are some who have not information enough to know where they may find materials fit to copy, or how to become plagiarists. To conclude, there is one charge on which I mult not be silent, it is that made against me by a Pole, of having, in several parts of the work, shown an animosity against his country. It is true, I never have been the partisan of a"], [25, "XIII political association, so constituted that several millions of men in it should be the serfs of five or i\\x hundred thousand feudal tyrants, who were scarcely ever in harmony with each other. If, however, the author of the Refec tions had been so obliging as to have trans-r mitted them to me before this second edition was printed, I should doubtless have attended to them.. I have no occasion to fay to those who read without prejudice, and who are not strangers to our language, that I certainly had no intention of applauding the massacres of Prague, and that the bitter irony with which I speak of them cannot be taken for appro bation. The author of the Refleblions mis- conceived me greatly when he made that ac cusation. With respect to the passage relative to Poland (page 39) which appears to have hurt him so much, I propose to him to change it as follows : \"At the period of which we speak, Poland exercised little influence on the states situated }o the west of her ; for, during the course of the fifteenth century, she was employed in wars with the Turks and Muscovites, and with the Teutonic knights,. who, under the pretext of converting the infidels, had, in its northern part, formed themselves into a government,"], [26, "XIV which was the first origin of the kingdom of Prussia.\" I have little to observe on this second edi tion: it will have the merit of being freed from a great number of faults, rather than that of offering considerable augmentations. I shall only repeat here what I have alreadysaid on the sub ject of my work. I was in Germany when the question was proposed by the National Institute, and did not know of it till very late. I did not at first determine to engage in it. Another work, which I wished to bring to an end, employed vak at that time. On considering, however, that I lived in the country in which Lather had ef fected his reformation, amidst his successors and the best informed of his partisans, I thought it right to take advantage of the lights offered to me ,and, in this competition, to become the interpreter of a very enlightened part of Eu rope. This resolution was so long procras tinated, that I had scarcely five months to ar range my plan, collect materials, put them in order, prepare my memoir, get it copied, and sent in time to reach Paris in the early part of April 1803, (15 Germinal, An. XL) the time appointed by the Institute. It would be superfluous to indicate all the"], [27, "XV known works from which I have taken my historical data ; such, for example, as those of Thym and of Spittler, for the compendium of ecclesiastical history at the end of the volume. But I cannot omit noticing assistance which was the more agreeable to me as arising from friendship. M. Eichhorn was printing his excellent His tory ef the three last centuries at the time, and had the complaisance to send me the dif ferent parts of this history, from which I have drawn much instruction and benefit, immedi ately on receiving them from the press. The piece published last year by M. Heeren.t at the beginning of his Historical Miscellanies, on the political consequences of the reformation, is known ; a piece bearing- the stamp of every thing which comes from his learned pen. It is there seen that its author had intended to be a competitor for the prize; but he has not made known the motive which diverted him from it: it was the following. M. Heeren wrote to consult me, as a Frenchman, on the language in which his memoir sliould be written. This was in December 1802, when I was closely engaged in the work, and employed on it without intermission. I answered that we were rivals ; but that I would willingly"], [28, "XVI abandon a competition in which I could not flatter myself with surpassing him; but that, if it was agreeable to him-, we would work in concert, or that I would translate his work into our language, leaving it to him to decide. To this M.Hecren replied in the most obliging manner, that he would give up the contest, (and consequently the -prize which he would easily have obtained) and that he should not enter into the second part of the question on the progress of knowledge. To this friendly procedure he added that he would forward his dissertation to me slieet by lheet, which he then determined to print. It is in the hands of the public, and a judgment may be formed of the advantage I was able to derive from it in the first section of the second part, which. treats on the political consequences of the reformation. Notwithstanding all these lights, and, not withstanding my endeavours, I feel how in ferior to my subject I have been, and how feeble such au essay is, on a subject which is so capable of expanded and happy developments- Is a man like my judges, or any of the great historians named in the. course of this work, had chosen to devote all his powers to treating it worthily, historical literature would no. doubt have been enriched with a valuable book, on a"], [29, "XVII subject so interesting to every man who thinks. It is, in fact, very remarkable that until the period when the Institute proposed the question no writer had thought of appropriating a work solely to an investigation of the consequences and the influence of the reformation by Za ther. Some detached passages, and some dis sertations on insulated points, offer only an in complete aggregate. It is known that the Protestant nations are far from deserving the reproach of having neglected history : they are very rich in excellent writings on the great re volution of the sixteenth century, which was of such decisive importance to them. But the glory does not belong the less to the National Institute of France of having drawn the ge neral attention to the results of so memorable an event. h"], [30, ""], [31, "ESSAY ON THE SPIRIT AND INFLUENCE OF THE REFORMATION BY LUTHER. I 1,1 \u25a0 \u2014 PART I. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. SECT. I. On the State of the Question. -il-F, during any of the centuries which pre ceded the sixteenth, and while no opposition had been raised against the supremacy ofthe Roman pontiffs, a learned assembly had been desirous of calculating the results of a schism, of a contrary opinion to that of Rome, the question would doubtless have been framed thus : \" what are the evils and the scandal, with which the church has been afflicted, on account of such an impious and pernicious doctrine ?\" At this time, when several respectable nations have separated from the Romilh church ; when the intimate con nection by which all Europe is united has con- JU"], [32, "\u25a0z vinced christians of that persuasion, that others are as virtuous, as well regul .ted, as enlightened as themselves, the question must necessarily as sume another form. An Assembly of philoso phers, in the bosom of France, restored to the catholic worship, proposes to ascertain the in fluence of Luther's reformation on the state of European society, on the progress of knowledge. This change in language implies a great one iu opinion ; and, in this point or view; the question may be said to answer itself. As tbe institute have not added any explana tory outline to the question, the following con siderations, the intention of which is to deter mine the o!je6t and. the latitude ofthe answer, will not appear misplaced. By a superficial observer, it may be thought that a religious revolution should only exercise its influence on matters connected with religion ; on the worship and the discipline ofthe church ; but long before Luther's reformation, the church and the state were so assimilated in every political body in Europe ; their rights and their constitu tions were so blended, that one of them could not be convulsed without the other experiencing the shock. The church, which had universally formed a state within a state, had carried its usurpations over the latter so far, that it threatened to swallow it up. All Europe was for a length of time in danger ofyielding to the dominion of an absolute theocracy. The tun"], [33, "3 perors of the new empire ofthe west, who saved it from that destiny, afterwards menaced it with the project of an universal monarchy. The Kings of France, England, Sweden, and Den mark, the princes and free cities of Germany and Italy offered only a partial and alternate opposition to the pretensions of either of the competitors. \u2014 Anew impulse; a new and pow erful tie, which united the oppressed against both the oppressors at the fame time ; an event which awakened every passion ; the love of liberty; a religious and political fanaticism, which augmented the power of princes in a ten fold degree, by exalting the people, which, in short, offered to the leaders, both independence and the rich prey of the spoils of the clergy ; such an event, 1 fay, must, in such a period, have produoed an universal agitation in Europe. The systems of the modern states were shook by it to their foundations. During the long and grievous struggle which followed, every thing acquired a different form, and a different esta blishment. A new political order arose from the ferment and general confusion : the different elements of which it was composed, long agi tated by contending forces, yielding, at length, to the laws of gravitation ofthe moral world, took the places in it assigned to them by their respective weights, but which, in most instances, were not those they had formerly occupied. A new scries of ideas also arose from this conflict of rt Q"], [34, "4 opinions: men dared to think, to reason, to ex amine those things which, before, required only a blind submission. Thus a simple attack on ecclesiastical discipline produced a considerable change in the political situation ofthe states of Europe, and in the morals of its inhabitants. The Inltitute was therefore inspired with the true spirit of history in encouraging the solution of the problem which it has so ably proposed. It is honourable to a writer to be called upon to treat of religion and politics, the two cardinal points of human life, before such an assembly. One ofthe first fruits of true liberty is the power of discussing these important objects without restraint, and the country where this privilege is exercised must incontrovertibly be free. In inquiring what has been the influence of the reformation of Luther, the Institute sliows clearly that it does not consider this influence as existing, at this time, in an active manner. In fact, near three centuries have elapsed since the first explosion. The agitation occa sioned by it became gradually calmed; the power which originally gave the impulse, and which produced so many new events, has ceased to act as a moving force, as a pro ductive principle. The greater part of the institutions which it created, and of those which it modified, have been preserved ; some are ex tinct : but those which remain are now guided by the universal course of events, and the re-"], [35, "5 formation is no longer the immediate cause which directs their progress. It has nearly ac complished every thing of which it is capable; its influence is now perceived only mediately, without convulsions, and by lhe course of the institutions originating from it. The time is therefore arrived when the advantages or dis advantages which have resulted to the human race from it, may be inquired into, enumerated^ and discussed. It will doubtless be conformable to the views ofthe Institute to confine myself to an exact specification ofall the proximate con sequences of the reformation, and to be satisfied with a flight notice of the remote ones. To engage in the details of these last, it would be necessary to draw the immense picture of the history of Europe subsequent to that period, since there is scarcely any great event, in which some result ofthe reformation, such as the pre sent constitution of the Germanic body, for example, or the republic of the United Pro vinces, has not, in its turn, exercised a greater or less degree of influence. We should never get freed from this labyrinth of mediate conse quences ; for, in this point of view, the influence of e\\ery political or religious commotion ex tends to infinity. To this day, we are more o*r less affected by what pasted in India, Arabia. Greece, and Italy, in very remote times; we still live very perceptibly under the influence of the irruption of. the northern tribes, of thq"], [36, "6 crusades, and of other political movements which have become the principles of action to the people. The line of deviation,- often crooked, sometimes retrogade, in the improve ment of nations, is produced by the compli cated action of many different forces : to mark its escapes, its aberrations, by putting a just value on the powers which have contributed to it, is the province of the philosophy of his tory. The author of the present essay will esteem himself fortunate, if his judges are of opinion that he has performed this task, with respect to that period of modern history in which the reformation was the predominant power. Nevertheless it is not possible to engage in an inquiry into the effects of the reformation, without being, in some degree, obliged to give way to this reflection : \" Is not the great event wliich I consider as a cause, in itself so much a simple result of other causes, which have pre# ceded it, that the true origin of all that has fol lowed it must be referred to them, and not to it, which has only been an intermedium ?\" \u2014 With out doubt sueh is the situation of the mind in these lesearches. While it looks forward, its of departure seems to be the fixed base from whence all the successive steps proceed. If its looks are turned back, the first point ap- pears to it only the necessary consequence of those which have preceded it, and as a passage Jo arrive at those which follow. To the mental"], [37, "7 eye, every cause, in ascending, becomes a simple effect: each effect becomes, in its turn, a cause, in descending. The inclination which we feel to attribute every thing which follows an event to the event itself, as though it was the cause of it, is the clew which guides us in the arrange ment of historical facts : it is the law of cohe sion by which the present is united to the past. To proceed in this nuinner from the effect to the cause, until we reach a first cause, subsisting by itself, and which cannot be the effect of any other cause, is a necessary consequence of our know ledge, which seeks an absolute principle to build its speculations on \u2014 It is on this slippery path that metaphysics is lost \u2014 Aman who, Avithout knowing the nature ofthe course ofa river, mould arrive on its banks, seeing it here glid ing through an extensive plain, there confined Avithin narrow vallies, in another place foam ing beneath the precipice of a cataract; this man Avould take the first turning where it might be concealed by a projection, for the origin of the river; ascending higher, a new turn, the cataract, Avill occasion the same illusion ; at length, he reaches its source, he takes the mountain from which it issues for the first cause ofthe river: but he will soon think that the fides ofthe mountain Avould be exhausted by so continual a torrent ; he will see clouds collected, the rains, Avithout which the dried mountain could not supply a spring. Then the clouds"], [38, "8 become the first cause ; but it was the Avinds Avhich brought these here, by passing over vast seas ; but it Avas the fun avIio attracted the clouds from the sea ; but whence arises this power of the fun ? Behold him then soon en tangled in the researches of speculative physics, by seeking a cause, an absolute foundation, from which he may, finally deduce the explanation of so many phenomena. Thus, the historian avIio inquires Avhat Avas the cause which led to the reduction of the authority of the Popes, to the terrible thirty years' war, to the humiliation of the house of Austria, the eftablisliment of a powerful opposi tion in the heart of the empire, the foundation of Holland as a free state, and so of other oc currences, Avill, at first, see the origin of all these events in the reformation, and will attribute them absolutely to its influence. But urging his inquires farther, he discovers that this reforma tion itself is evidently only a necessary result of other circumstances, A.'hich precede it, an event of the sixteenth century, Avith Avhich the fif teenth, to use the expression of Leibnitz, was pregnant : at most, the cataract of the river. Plow many are there who are still of opinion they have found the first cattie of the French revolution in the deficit, in the convocation of the states-general, in the tiers-clat, in the curates! Others, avIio carry their views a little farther, attribute it to the parliament Maupeou,"], [39, "9 the extinction of the Jesuits, &c. \u2014 They are all right in that limited point of view which they have taken. Those, however, who contemplate the progress of human nature during a succession of ages, see this enormous mass of individual cases roll on, each of which, animated by its interest, its passions, and its peculiar spirit, seems desirous to counteract the progress of all the others ; but notwithstanding their infinite di versity, all these motiveshave common features tending towards certain ends, which, finally, are the fame ; these features, these tendencies com* mon to all, form a collection of powers, or rather a single power, Avhich is that of the human race, that of a universal spirit, which, concealed through ages, guides and governs them. Under the dominion of providence (that fun ofthe moral Avorld, to use again the expression of a philosopher), this spirit of humanity, by its continual action, prepares and disposes events. This great revolution which surprizes us, is only a product, a result, a striking manifestation. Is it therefore to it, is it not rather to the influence of the causes which have themselves preceded and led to it, that the events which have fol lowed it should be attributed? In the case in question, therefore, it is requisite for the historian to attend to what had passed before the great event which he examines: to ascertain the influence of the causes by which the event itself was brought about, and, in what"], [40, "10 degree these same causes have influenced the series of subsequent events. Jt is also requisite for him to consider what would have happened through the flow and progressive course of hu manity, Avhich is sometimes called the natural course of things, if the great event, if the con vulsion in question, had not supervened. Finally, he must determine what particular modifications in its results have been occasioned by the proper and individual character of this event ; the cha racter of the age and ofthe nation in which it occurred, and that of the men who had the principal share in it."], [41, "11 SECT. II. On the Essence of Reformations in general. \u00c6-S the mind rises through the series of events, and passes from each effect to its cause, to attain, at length, to a first cause, Avhich serves it as a principle, and where it forms the first link of its chain; in the fame manner it descends from causes to effects, eager to arrive at a last result, an absolute effect, Avhich is satisfactory of itself, and is not required to become a cause or to act the part of a simple medium leading still further. This effect which must terminate every thing, the last link ofthe chain, and final result of all which has preceded it, is the object sought by the mind, the place of repose at which it finally consents to stop. All its speculations on human events are divided into this double inquiry of principle and object : from what do they arise, and to what do they tend ? It is within these two points that the action ofthe mind is restrained, and it chuses them more or less proximate, or more or less re mote, according to its capacity, or to its exist ing wishes. But when it has not attained, on the one hand, to a cause which it feels warranted in taking for a primitive one, and, on the other, 2"], [42, "12 to an object Avhich it considers as final, the mind osman remains in suspense, it vacillates Avithin a compulsory equilibrium, and experiences the inquietude of an unaccomplished purpose. It is true, it may be possible for it to give up that space which it has determined not to investigate, and to assign a boundary within which the entire exercise of its power shall be restrained; but even this resignation is not in the power of every mind, nor is it, perhaps, in the primitive nature of any. Let us therefore allow him Avho reflects on the history ofthe human race to ask, to Avhat tends this succession of tumultuous events, of commo- tions, of transmutations in things and in opi nions ? Let him dare to give free A7ent to his thoughts in the investigation ofthe final end of so many progressive revolutions \u2014 He can only find it in that sublime idea ofa state pftningrs, in which the destination of humanity, in the aggregate, being perfectly accomplished, all its physical and moral powers having attained the highest degree of development, men would be as good, as enlightened, as happy as the origi nal dispositions of their nature would admit of. Not that he will be able to show that this golden age of morality, this ckilia/hi of philosophy, can ever be realized, such as a beneficent <! ream re presents it to us. But in the efforts of lncn, in those of nations, we cannot misconceive thai tendency to improvement, to an order ei1 things"], [43, "13 more just, more humane, -in Avhich the rights of all shall be, better secured, and these rights be more equally distributed. Let us acknowledge that absolute perfection will never be the lot of mortals ; but let us, at the fame time, avow that this perfection forms the ideal object of their Aviflies, that it is the desire of their reason. It is not asserted that they will reach it, but it is unquestionable that they aspire to it. Perhaps the geometrical phenomenon ofthe assymptote is repeated in the moral world, and that, conti nually approaching to a point of meeting on the curve, Ave shall never touch it. Nevertheless the hope of the approximation alone is suffi cient to inflame exalted minds, and is an object worthy of them. Alas ! what Avould be the fate of the generations which succeed each other, Avhat the despair of him who meditates upon them, if the laws of a creation, incessantly actiA7e, were not discoverable through the chaos of human affairs ; if, in the darkest commotions A.'hich threaten to engulph all things, the light of providence did not permit the distant view of a happier futurity ? It is certainly- true that in the unbridled tempests, the Avhirlwinds raised by the passions on the ocean of time, the direct road to this object cannot always be strictly fol lowed: and to deviate, to pause, become too frequently necessary. The observer, sometimes deceived, may suppose the progress retrogade, Avhile, at the fame time, it is not so; for all are"], [44, "14 not provided with a compass sufficiently correct to point out the path it ought to follow. But he Avho asserts that it is retrogade, by so doing- admits the existence of the object ; for to retro- gade is only to remove farther from it. And admitting that this backsliding takes place for a time, can it, from thence, result that, after- wards the approximation shall not be made with greater celerity ? Is not that a contracted sight which cannot penetrate beyond the point at which it is checked ? To judge ofall the road, it must be contemplated entire. That part of it which humanity must pass through after us, is unknown to us ; but we may form an opinion of it by Avhat has been already done. Until our time mankind have advanced on it, and it is to be expected that our successors will also advance \u2014 Greece and Italy, savage at the first, were far behind Greece and Italy in the refined period of their .improvement. But however eminent this amelioration may, in many respects, have been, it was individual to each of these nations, exclusive to all others : it belonged to the citizen of Rome, to the citizen of Athens, but it did not belong to man. All the rest of the globe was barbarous and enslaved, slaves in fact to a few thousand individuals. Could the development of civilization be always restrained to a tAv cities, to so contracted a corner of the earth ? Could the millions of human beinszs.. who vegetated iu the nations from the Oby to"], [45, "15 tbe Elbe remain eternally strangers to it, and sen7e only as a supply to the armies and the galley-slaves of the privileged people ? Doubt less no. There must be a dispersion of know ledge among them : there must be a mixture, Avhich Avould convey the spirit of Latium and Achaia into Cimbria. The means of accom plisliing this Avas, either that the small body, in possession of knowledge, must overcome these' innumerable tribes, and penetrate to the ex tremity of continents almost inaccessible; or, otherwise, that the multitude of these rude na tions should conquer the small people and be come blended Avith them iri the very focus of knowledge. After the employment of the first alternative, the Romans having penetrated as far as their strength, and a bravery Avorthy of eternal admiration, permitted them, the second, and more natural method, was brought into action by the mysterious arbiter of human des tiny. The people of the north over-ran the south of Europe, and brought their ignorance into it. Chaos seemed restored ; knowledge twinkled faintly and with difficulty here and there in the midst of profound night, Avhich lasted for a- time proportionate to the foreign mass which had newly appeared it required ten centuries of fermentation to assimilate such a quantity of heterogeneous elements Avith the superior ones which had been blended among them. At length knowledge burst forth again on"], [46, "16 aH fides. During three centuries since its re-ap pearance, it has spread aud made an unheard-of progress. The civilization of Athens and of Rome have been rediscovered, not only through all Europe, but at Philadelphia and Calcutta. Rome and Athens which our arts and our know ledge would astonish, Avould also admire the humanity of the European, whose boast is that he is a man, and who no longer suffers slavery to taint his soil. \u2014 This then has resulted from the horrible irruption of the barbarians in the fourth century, and thus at length time has justified Providence, the power of which, for one, or even for several generations, appears sometimes to have wholly ceased to act. I have selected this example because the appa rent degradation of humanity, during the long interval ofthe barbarism ofthe middle ages, is generally the favourite theme brought forward by the opponents of perfectibility in support of their opinion. And if we enter into the detail ofthe gradual civilization of these barbarians, who are the pro genitors ofthe most polished nations of the pre sent day, Avhat Avill first engage the attention ? Power, the only right : each individual ; each master ofa castle, at war with all his neishbour liood ; and these Avars, which may be said to have been fought man to man, deluging the land Avith blood, carrying desolation into every corner of it, taking place without any law but the"], [47, "17 ferocity of the conqueror. What a dismal pic ture is that' of the Gauls, for example, in this anarchial state ! By degrees, the valour, or the fortune of some of the chiefs brought extensive provinces under their dominion, in .vhich they introduced order and discipline, and the inhabit ants Avere relieved from the horrors of a universal and unceasing warfare: finally, these provinces themselves became united under a single govern ment ; millions of men, formerly separated into a multiplicity of hordes, Avhich massacred each other indiscriminately, Avere from thence for ward compatriots, brothers, subject to the same laws, restrained by the fame discipline. Where murder and unchecked pillage held their sway, safety, harmony, and order are now seen ; Gaul has become one homogeneous whole, overall the extent of which reigns that perpetual peace which is felt, but not acknowledged. WiU our civil Avars be brought forward ? These, at least, have beeu the effect of accidents, of crises against nature ; they can no longer be said to be the permanent and constitutional state ofthe Avhole of a country. The curative power ofthe entire body speedily brings a remedy, and experience has proved that they become more and more easy to extinguish. We may therefore conclude, in despite of that gloomy disposition Avhich oc casions so many to be ardent admirers of the past, merely that they may more freely depre ciate the present, that our time is far superior c"], [48, "18 to that ofthe Goths and Vandals ; and although humanity has risen through all the distance Avhich separates them, the consoling prospeftive, that our posterity Avill reach a better and a hap pier state, is not denied to us. I solicit the indulgence of my judges for this, almost involuntary, effusion of my soul. I know the language of speculation may be hazarded before sages, Avhose intention is to add the con solatory views of philosophy to the study os history. But is it possible to avoid directing the attention towards an amelioration of human affairs, while meditating on the consequences of those sanguinary revolutions, of Avhich the re formation effected by Luther, offers so memor able an example ? At each of these great con vulsions of nations, should we not accuse the Divine Providence of tyrannical absurdity, if the result os so many evils Avas only to precipi tate mankind into a worse state than that from which they had been freed ? But no ; after these deplorable crises, in which so many individuals have been sacrificed, it is not uncommon to see a better order of things arise, to see the whole species advance, Avith more freedom, towards the great object pointed out by reason, and at tain to anew development of its improvement, at each new explosion of its poAvers. From these premises we may consider the gradual improvement of the human race as con sisting in an uninterrupted succession of resor-"], [49, "19 mations ; some of them silent and slow, the lingering results of ages, ofthe individual per- suasion of powers, and of opinion, Avhich, in the end, supersedes errors : others, striking and powerful, the suddens results of a burst of light which strikes all eyes, of the lassitude of long oppression, of an excessive necessity of restoring an equilibrium in some part of the political or religious system. The latter are the periods, the miliary stones to the human race in their progress through time. History numbers them with care, investigates their results, and deter mines by them the divisions of her Avork. Men of meek minds, warmed by a mild phi lanthropy without enthusiasm, who are more affected by a horror of present evils than they are flattered Avith a hope of future good ; those moderate minds Avhich are terrified at a violent procedure and the fury of revolts; these, I fay, adhering to the ameliorations, the reforms Avhich time brings round Avithout agitation, de sire, and with justice, that good mould never be manifested but under a beneficent form. Where ever they perceiAre the burst of passions, arms provoked by arms, thunder answering thunder, they sigh, they are grieved, they protest equally against both parties. Frequently they declare against that which has first broken the repose so dear to them ; although, very often, this -is in reality innocent, in reality driven to extre mity by oppression.\u2014 May we not rank in this c 2"], [50, "20 class a great number of the adversaries of our last revolution, so many worthy and upright men At ho have been crushed in the shock of parties? In this manner, the aversion of some distin guished men of the sixteenth century, not to the doctrine, but to the events ofthe reforma tion, may be explained. Erasmus called it the Lutheran tragedy ; and it was, insect, because the drama marked its issue as tragic, that this A.ise and circumspect man, whose favourite motto was otittm cum dignitate, refused to act a part in it *. But to desire that good should only be effected by good, is to make humanity a romance; it is to convert history into an idyl, and the universe into an Arcadia. Unfortu nately it does not happen thus. Nature, among the multiplicity of benefits which it be stows on the earth, afflicts it with hurricanes, inundations, subterraneous fires, the types of the dreadful scourges which are sometimes found in society, and whjch are often occa sioned by the faults of our predecessors, some times by our own. It is necessary therefore * It is known besides that Erasmus was not of a disposi tion to sacrifice his interest to his opinions. He aspired to a cardinal's hat, and although he might not succeed, his anxiety for it gives a clew to his conduct towards the re formers. The catholic clergy still retained more dignities and more riches than the protestant clergy, with the people ofthe stamp of Erasmus, this reason was -.ufficient to induce them to declare in favour of the first."], [51, "21 for the man who would enjoy his own period to submit to them, and to consider them as the accomplishment os the profound laws Avhich guide the great whole : laws which Ave can never misinterpret, except a\\ hen Ave perfume to judge of their operation too partially, and in too contracted a point of view. The amelioration of his institutions, whether political or religious, which man unceasingly aspires to, consists in bringing and keeping them as near as he possibly can to the peculiar spirit Avhich constitutes their essence. The ex-, terior forms with which they are clothed are sel dom so agreeable to the spirit as to admit of its entire action and accomplishment. It too fre quently happens that the clogged .vheels of the machine suspend and render the impulse ofthe main spring irregular. It is the nature of man himself, who is a compound of soul and body closely united, which subjects all human insti tutions to this discordant duplicity. Contained in, aud, as it were, shackled by the corporeal or gans given to him for its manifestation, his understanding cannot give freedom to the exercise of its ideas, nor produce them as ethe real as it conceived them. To act and be per ceptible, externally, thought must be allied Avith a body, to which it gives its form, and which is communicated in its stead. Hence, for exam ple, arise the extreme importance of language, the faculty of thinking and the truth of this"], [52, "22 position, that without language Ave ssiould be unable to combine our ideas. Thus, for the use of man, every institution requires to be pro- vided Avith a body, a physical and sensible form. The spirit of all religions is, without doubt, originally the fame, as Avell as that of all governments. The one consists in acknow- ledging, as laws imposed by God himself, the moral laws and the rules of duty engraved on the hearts ofall men ; the other, in securing his natural rights to every member of society. But Avhat would that religion be, Avhat that govern- ment, which depended only on this simple idea, Avhich mould only be a pure spirit? It Avould not be an organized machine, capable of acting in the human world: it would not be a human institution. ' To become so, it must have an ex-* ternal form, organs, a visible and material con sistence. Nevertheless, the unalterable eternal spirit, which forms the soul of these institutions, re mains always Avhat it was, always similar to it self. But this is not the case with, the body, the external form. This, subject to the in fluence of the physical Avorld, of human pas sions, variable, perissiable, is modified by acci dent and by events. In proportion as its confi guration becomes changed, as its organs be come cramped, thickened, overcharged, the oppressed and shackled spirit loses its primitive action and direction; sometimes stifled under"], [53, "23 a monstrous aggregate, it entirely ceases to manifest itself: the phantom no longer has life or pliancy ; it possesses only the rigidity and heaviness of death. Thus the pure and sublime spirit of Christianity, to which no form less pure and less simple than itself is fitting,* was successively smothered, during a long series of ages, until the sixteenth century, by a conti- nual load of foreign elements, which had vi- tiated its action, and, gradually, produced a misliapen body, from Avhence issued all the ills which the errors and the passions Avhere capable of generating. Thus history, the depository of Avoeful experience, shows us almost always, that the political constitutions, establimed to maintain natural justice among the people, dege nerate in the end, and finish by being clogged Avith a mass, inimical to liberty and to the pub lic welfare. This opinion, almost always con\u00ab * Fenelon, in his Lettre stir Vexistence de Dieu et sur le cultedigne de lui (in the second volume of \u0152uvres Philoso. phiques), repeats several times, that the Christian religion i$ only the love of God. At page 16, he quotes Tertuliant \u25a0who, with the same idea says, thai the soul is naturally Chris tian : and at page 28, St. Augustine, according to whom, there can be no other worship but love, nee colitur ille nisi amando. \" This, \" according to Fenelon, \" is the reign of God within us ; it is the worship in spirit and in truth : it is the sole end for which God has made us. \" It is ob vious that the Holy See would sind this mode of being a, a Christian not very agreeable."], [54, "24 firmed by the event, is therefore very generally received by those Avho reflect on the fate of nations, \" that a government, democratic in its principle, is successively, and in a shorter or longer period, converted into an oligarchy, or monarchy, and finishes by degenerating into despotism \". Hence, at certain epochas, springs the desire, generally felt by all upright and disinterested minds, of a reform in the great human esta blishments. The external form is in general too revolting to the spirit. What must be the issue when, no longer harmonizing with it, it constrains, oppresses, paralyzes it? It must, inthe end, burst forth, it must free itself from a body Avhich no longer supplies it with organs calculated to second its development. Man kind, avIio all, in a greater or less degree, pos sess a correct idea, a type of this spirit, are en raged against the haughty and pernicious co lossus; they crush it in their indignation, and compel it to give back the holy flame which it concealed ; light and vaccillating, they are unable to seize it; they must inclose it in a vessel formed by their hands, they must unite it to a new sensible form. Thus after having: destroyed the old edifice of the Ptoman com munion, the confession of Augsburg, and other similar codes Avere requisite for the Christians separated from it : after the destruction of the French monarchy, it Avas necessary to fix the"], [55, "25 spirit of government, and that of the natural rights of man, in the positiA'e forms of a new constitution. But in forming a judgment of these reforma tions, how necessary is it to attend to the general spirit of the time and of the country in which they have been effected ? From this double circum stance, as well as from the individual character of their author, and of his principal co-operators. from the design and the local object of these per son*, &c. they receive their modifications, their peculiar colouring. Moses, leaving Egypt at the head of a troop of mutinous, superstitious, sen sual slaves, whom he had to reduce to submission, to make soldiers capable of every enterprize, and animated against every nation which might occupy the territory on which he purposed to establisli them ; in such circumstances, Moses directed the reform of his people so as to conduce to the ac complishment of his designs. Mahomet, reform ing a free and proud nation, sensual to excess, but capable of exaltation, and of virtue, succeeded in investing himself with a great character, and re duced the exterior form of the pure deism he preached to very simple terms. Both of them blended the religious constitution, Avhich ssiould be suitable to all men, with the political con stitution, which can only be calculated for one nation -, they confounded the church and the state, and, by that, rendered their religion purely local. With respect to Jesus, in con-"], [56, "26 formity to his celestial origin, he separated the cares of the state from those of the church, whose empire, he proclaimed, was not of this world. In the midst of the Jewish nation, which had re-- ceived from Moses, during their forty years' re- sidence in the desert, a legislation suitable to the wants ef their first establissiment, in Palestine, but which had reached the highest pitch of the necessity for reform, Jesus undertook that of all mankind, inasmuch as he rejected the forms which were only calculated for a local spirit, and called them to the universal spirit of religion, which is the fame to all men. Thus the work of his re- formation, from the truly divine spirit which is the foul of it, and the simplicity of the forms in which it is clothed, would be adopted by every upright man, whose single heart was unsophisti- cated by the restraint of local forms. The divine reform effected by Jesus is therefore essentially, and in opposition to the other two, cosmopolite, or catholic, according to the true etymology of that term. Perhaps the form given to it by him was too simple, and when the religious society founded in his name spread over the whole earth, it might be necessary to add to this form. Hence also the power Avhich the legislator might, on this point, have transmitted to the future church. But the right of applying a suitable form was not that of vitiating it, of overloading it, of rendering it opposite to the spirit itself, of Avhich it ssiould only have been the organ, The spirit of Christ"], [57, "27 was no longer perceptible in the constitution of the western Christian church, in the fifteenth century. The subordination of the church to the state, in human and terrestrial matters; the dif ference of the two, in that relating to the earth and in that relating to heaven, that primitive dis tinction, had been violently effaced : the extrane ous spirit of some fanciful institutions had crept into the incoherent phantom ot modern Christi anity ; all was blended and falsified : a reformation was required, a restoration of the primitive spirit, a simplification of the external form. This re formation was effected in the sixteenth century, in a part of the west ,- and it was called by the name of Litther, who Avas the courageous and principal promoter of it. It may also be observed that the exterior form of religious institutions, being the part which more immediately affects the senses of man, and, consequently, engages his passions, and, on the contrary, that the spirit which animates these in stitutions, corresponding strictly with his under standing, it results, first, that the more a society is composed of ignorant, sensual men devoted to matter, the more does it require of external prac tices, of precepts purely ceremonial, in its worssiip: and the passionate attachment for such a worssiip, arising from the senses, may be carried to an ex cess, at which it sets all attempts, even of the most convincing nature, at nought ; and, secondly, that the more a society of men is enlightened, the"], [58, "28 more the intellectual faculties are cultivated in it, preferably to the sensual ones, the more the spirit of its other institutions has remained pure, the less superfluity will it admit in the constitution of its worssiip, and the more will it be disposed to a reformation in this respect. The passionate attachment for Avhat is simply the body and form of religion, the attachment which produces a misapprehension of the spirit, and transfers to the accessories, the dogmas, the exterior of a worssiip, that veneration which be longs only to the divinity, this deviation, so common among ignorant and sensual men, is the origin afc superstition. Pernicious, fatal disposition, which, fixing the focus of enthusiasm in the centre of the senses, and the passions, leads to the greatest excesses, and the most horrible cruelties. The contrary inclination, that by which man, following the impulse of his spiritual nature, is disposed to reject all form and body in religion, to be devoted only to its spirit ; this exclusion of an outAvard and visible worssiip, is the road which leads to mysticism. It is frequently the portion of thoughtful and solitary men, who, not feeling a necessity to influence other men, think they can dispense Avith the senses, and keep to the pure spirit of religion. This attachment to the spirit, divested of every thing local and accidental, must produce sentiments nearly similar, in all who in dulge in it. Hence the singular conformity ob served between theoDinions of our mystical"], [59, "29 Christians, Quesnel and Fenelon, and of some Spa niards and Germans, with those of the Bramins of India. Mysticism, the common lot of mild and contemplative minds, may very readily pro duce an intellectual fanaticism, but it is attended with no danger to society, provided the mysticism is sincere, and not brought into action by hypocrites. Our revolution, during its ssiort existence, had its superstitious, its mystcys, and its', hypocrites. The dryness of this digression, which must now be brought to a conclusion, can only be excused by the necessity Avhich the author felt to throw every light on the point of view, in which, as it appeared to him, it was requisite to consider the influence ofa revolution which began with the domains of religion, and to bring it thus forward as the first lineaments of his Avork."], [60, "30 SECT. HI. On that of Luther in partkuletr. Jl wo objects are principally dear to the heart of man, and it is not uncommon to fee him sa crifice all his other interests, even life itself, to them. The one is the preservation of his social rights, the other, the independence of his religious opinions : liberty in his civil actions, and liberty in the operations of his conscience. To both of them he affixes a value equal to that of his exist ence. The idea of recovering them, when lost, carries him to the highest pitch of enthusiasm; that of losing them, throws him, while he possesses them, into a despair, which fits him for any un dertaking. Both these dispositions lurked silently in almost every part of Europe, at the beginning; of the sixteenth century. One nation, which had lost its civil and religious liberty, began to feel the weight and indignity of its chains ; another, which still enjoyed a portion of independence, ssiuddered at seeing it on the point of being taken away. Every state in this part of the world, and more particularly the confederation of states which formed the empire of Germany, had long been tormented Avith the opposite opinions arising from the obstinate contest between the emperors} suc cessors to the C\u00e6sars, and the Popes, successors tos"], [61, "31 St. Peter, a contest, of Avhich the prize would have been an unlimited monarchy over all the an cient territory of the Roman empire.

This magical name of Rome still charmed for ages after its real glory had vanissied, and its power is not wholly extinct even in our days. One of the most unfortunate habits among men is, that of being mechanically persuaded, that Avhat has endured for a long time must endure for ever ; that an existence of one day cstablissies aright for that which follows ; that history can only be a periodi cal repetition of the fame events, and that every age must resemble other ages. * Rome had long been the capital of the world, and therefore ic followed, that it must always remain so.

They called themselves C\u00e6sars, because the ancient C\u00e6sars had been emperors in Rome, and Rome was mistress of the better part of Eu rope; the prince, therefore, ,vho Avas called C\u00e6sar, ought incontestibly to reign over Rome and over Europe, in his quality of emperor. This was long thought an undeniable argument. The right of the Popes was not quite so clear; but it Avas not the less revered. Since Rome was the natural mistress of all the universe, and the prince who had resided so long at Rome was the head of the empire, it was evident that the Bishop of Rome must also be the head of the church. By degrees, through the medium of machinations, of measures skilfully commenced and obstinately followed, this primacy ofthe Roman pontiff was establissied, though not without difficulties and troubles. When Rome was afterwards without an emperor, the dignity of the pontiff naturally increased ; from the second rank which he had till then held, he found himself in the first. And when the Frank and Roman princes adopted the singular ambition of being crowned emperors in the city of the C\u00e6sars, the Popes did the honours of the empire, and, in crowning its new heads, appeared to bestow them.

God forbid that I ssiould be suspected of the vile design of insulting the clergy, and the head of the Roman church in this Avork. Noav, Avhen ages of humiliation, of despoliation, of persecution itself, have expiated ages of pride, covetousness, and intolerance, it would be bar barous to charge the successors Avith the crimes of their predecessors. The present members of the priesthood are not those of former days. How grateful would it also be, to be able to believe that the ancient spirit, which, after a period of vain glory, brought so many days of disgrace on the church, was wholly extinguissied in its ministers ! Let us, however, hope that the greater number of them participate in the knowledge of their cotemporaries, that the harshness of modern or thodoxy has given place to a spirit, milder and more conformable to the ancient spirit of the Gospel. Neither the latter Pontiffs, who have"], [65, "35 manifested virtues truly apostolical in the Holy See, nor a noultiplicity of modest and learned priests, are involved in the severe judgments which the vices and misconduct of the Pontiffs and priests of the fourteenth and fifteenth cen turies merit. Who will impute the crimes of Ne ro to Marcus Aurelius, the enormities of Alex ander VI. to Pius VII. ? But this observation made, the historian, whose task is to paint events as they happened, must be allowed to explain the causes of the indignation and revolt of nations in a period already far from ours : he must be allowed, I fay, to cast off dissimulation, and to think and speak with the cotemporaries of the facts which he details, to expose the disgrace of those who have merited disgrace, and to justify the fury ofthe oppressed, by an undisguised recital of the oppression. The consideration of the essence of the revolu tion effected by Luther, in Europe, involves three principal points, which satisfactorily deter mine its nature and subsequent influence. By not attending to all the three, we ssiould proba bly misconceive the real essence of this great event, and ssiould not discover, in its aggre gate, the general action and spirit of mankind in the sixteenth century, a spirit, every power of which was developed on this occasion. The first of these three points is the political state of the European nations, their internal posi tion, their situation with respect to each other, s> 2"], [66, "36 and with respect to the head of the empire and the head ofthe church. The second is the religious state of these nations, their greater or less obedience to the decrees of the pontifical throne, and the disposition of princes in this respect. The third, which is intimately connected with the tAvo first, and more immediately with the second, is the state ofthe sciences and of letters in Europe, which, having become barbarous in the fifth century, had been plunged in darkness and chaos during the succeeding period, but Avhich, for about three centuries, had been progressively, though slowly, improving in knowledge. It is only by a thorough investigation of these three points of view that We can arrive at a satis. factory knoAvledge of the general spirit and posi tion of the European states in the sixteenth cen tury, and, by it, to an exact acquaintance with all the consequences of the reformation. But how Avill it be possible, here, to enter into the immense detail, the researches, and the develop ments Avhich this triple picture would require?

I. POLITICS. A multitude of goA'ernments had been formed in Europe, out of the wreck of the Roman Avestern empire, at the head of which Avere, for the most part, the leaders of the northern tribes Avhich had overturned the empire. Alternately weak and poAverful, these states, Avhich Avere long without consistence, changed their masters and thtjir form, according to the chance of events : they were raised, aggrandized, fell and were ex- tinguished ; and through all these vicissitudes, feAv ideas of a union, of an agreement among the Aveak to oppose the more powerful, could be perceived ; there was not as yet any trace of that grand and fruitful thought ofa balance of power. Nevertheless the feudal aristocracy had gradually lost its strength : the crusades and the other wars Avhich had impoverissied the nobility ; commerce and industry, which had enriched the trading class ; the knowledge, Avhich had been disseminated in it, and which had awakened it to a sentiment of the prerogatives of man, and of his natural rights, at length, led to the establissiment of a"], [68, "38 civil existence for the third estate, and to its in fluence on governments. The inhabitants of some of the cities, which were constituted free, even dared to assume the sovereignty in them, which Avould not fail to produce some effect on opinion, at that time so much enveloped in darkness, and so much the offspring of preju dice. Italy, divided into a great number of feeble states, some monarchical, others republican, dis- tracted internally by the jealousy and hatred of these petty states to each other, and by the in- subordination of the individual barons and lords Avho aspired to independence, was still the un- happy theatre of the invasions of its powerful neighbours, the French, the Germans, and the Spaniards, who all aimed at obtaining a firm footing in it, some at Naples, others at Milan, Mantua, &c This beautiful country was a prey to desolations which succeeded each other Avithout intermission. Its weak sovereigns, now taking part with a powerful conqueror, now jea- lous of his progress, and conspiring to expel him from their country, in general, only saved themselves by perfidy, fraud, and a crafty policy, Avhich has ever since been one of the most pro- minent traits in the Italian character. This country, long the richest in Europe, and the cen tre of all its commerce, was on the point of seeing the source of its opulence dry up, on ac count of the new outlets which had been opened"], [69, "39 to commerce on the ocean, by the Spanissi and Portuguese vessels. The Turks had just possessed themselves of tlte feat of the eastern empire, and carried their vic torious arms westward, into Calabria, Hungary, and to the very gates of Vienna. soland, freed during the course of the fifteenth century from the convulsions of an anarchial aristocracy, exhausting all its strength within it self, was almost nothing without. In the northern part of it, the Knights of the Teutonic Order, under pretence of converting the infidels, had formed themselves into a government, which was the first origin of the kingdom of Prussia. Russia can scarcely be said to have had an ex istence, to the west of Europe, Avhere it has since acquired so much ascendancy. Sweden and Denmark Avere also nearly nullities to the states situated to the south of them. The Kings of Denmark, after many wars and vicissi tudes of fortune, had subjected to their dominion, Sweden, impatient, and constantly disposed to throw off this foreign yoke. A hero, sprung from its bosom, accomplissied this undertaking: Gustavus Vafa became the legitimate sovereign of the country he had delivered. The North of Germany, which might have been called Saxon Germany, since the ancient Saxon race were its governors, was divided into states, most of which were of small extent and not rich. They were united to the south ofthe empire only"], [70, "40 by the bond, at that time so loose and so ill-defined, of the Germanic confederation. However, the emperor being incessantly harassed by the Otto mans, had the most powerful motives for keep ing on friendly terms with these Saxon princes, Avho Avere able to afford him some assistance. This part of the empire had seen a formidable league of commercial cities, united by a common interest, formed in its bosom. The Teutonic Hanse Avas raised to oppose the pillaging of the seudal plunderers, who, from their castles, or ra ther from their retreats, infested the roads in their neighbourhood, and despoiled the merchants travelling from fair to fair. The cities of Lom bardy, and those on the Rhine, had formed similar confederations, and these associations of free men, Avhose activity Avas so beneficial, were of the small number of establissiments, really humane, in these early days, Avhich modern nations may be proud of. Bohemia had more particularly ssiown the ex ample of a republican spirit to Europe, though it was only applicable to the liberty of conscience. The partisans of the Bohemian martyr, John Hufs, had maintained their religious creed by prodigies of valour and perseverance. The Austrian princes had not been able to make them renounce it. An agreement had been entered into, between the prince and his subjects, on the article of worssiip. This example seemed to invite the remainder of the Christian world to"], [71, "41 free itself in the same manner. It was not be cause the brave Bohemians made use of the cha lice iii their communion service that they were commendable and worthy of imitation, but ra ther, because, in this respect, they did that Avhich their consciences directed them, and had by their courage obtained it as a right. The south of Germany Avas nearly subjected to the same partitions as the north : but the strongest half of this country made part ofthe states of the colossal house of Austria, Avhich5 invested with an almost hereditary claim to the imperial dig nity, enriched Avith all the states of Burgundy under Maximilian, Avith the crowns ofSpain under his successor Charles the Fifth, and Avith a portion of Italy, no longer disguised its plan of universal monarchy. This power Avas predominant at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and threatened to swallow up all the others. Nevertheless, its noble rival, France, which con tributed fo powerfully to save Europe from this disgrace, France had at length repulsed from her territories the English, who had so long contended for a part of it. The permanent and hired army, Avhich the kings Avere obliged on this occasion to keep on foot, was of singular utility to them in uniting to the crown the provinces Avhich had their peculiar lords, in despoiling these great and small vassals, and enriching the state at their ex pense. Louis XI. had nearly completed this in crease of the royal power. Charles VIII. and"], [72, "42 Louis XII. had tried their arms in Italy against the imperialists. Notwithstanding their reverses, they had at least ssiown them that they might become formidable. After them, Francis I. found himself at the head of a powerful force, with out doubt the first in Europe after that of Austria. Between these two powers, and at the expense of the first, a republic of simple energetic moun taineers were formed, Avho were the first to teach modern Europe to believe Avhat is related of the Courage of the Spartans at Thermopyla, and of their virtues in Laconia. The Swiss had resumed the right, which every man will seize whenever he is able, that of living independent and be ing masters of themselves. They supported themselves against the jealousy of Austria, by relying on the protection of the Kings of France. England, which had so long neglected the sta tion to which nature had called it, that of a ma ritime power ; which had so long wasted its most valuable means on the conquest and defence of a few provinces in the west of France, had, at length, had the good fortune, as it may be called, to see its armies driven from the continent, and forced to return to their island. This apparent loss be came a real advantage to the nation, which, in the end, directed its activity to the establissiment of its liberty and of its fleets. England was not, in the sixteenth century, what it has become 3"], [73, "43 since ; but it was, at that time, in the rank of the chief powers of Europe, and Henry VIII. a vio lent and unsteady prince, who commenced by writing against Luther like an angry theologian, and finissied by copying him, would have played a much more important part in Europe than he did, if, less occupied Avith his passions, his amours, and his cruelties, he had made a wise use of his power in foreign countries. Spain had long consumed its strength, on its own soil, in contending with the Moors, who, for ages, had occupied the bett and finest parts of it. At length these conquerors were expelled. Ferdinand of Arragon, '.vho had acquired the glory of accomplissiing thi,'. deliverance of Spain, mar ried Isabella, and, thus, joined Castile and Arragon. These united states fell to Charles the Fifth, and, under him, Spain was only a province of the vast Austrian monarchy. At the fame t ime, the political system, and the new species o f warfare which was now intro- duced, became r nore and more favourable to the great powers. 1 he invention of artillery rendered castles and simp le walls useless, and required the erection of sort resses Avhich were too costly for the small princ es and states. Their standing armies also gave the great sovereigns a decided advantage over those who were unable to support the expense of them. The princes of the em pire had more reason than ever to dread that Charles V. wot dd serve them as Louis XI. had"], [74, "44 c treated the lords of France. But notwithstanding this danger, they Aveakened themselves still more by dividing their states among their heirs, and by assigning portions of them to all their sons, as though the people and the provinces were their property : this right had not then been called in question. The Europeans, who, till this time, had been confined Avithin the limits of the old Avorld, had just launched beyond it : the road to India and to America had been discovered. While enter prising, navigators Avere, in this manner, subduing an ocean which had been thought unconquer able, every mind seemed also desirous of being liberated from the narrow circle of ideas within Avhich they had been confined for ages. The human race advanced perceptibly toAvards the point of maturity of a new epoch. A change in the order of things, an approaching commo tion seemed at hand : a rumbling was- heard in the bowels of the volcano \u2022 ardent vapours burst forks', and streamed through the obscu rity. Such was the menacing fermentation which appeared in the political state of na tions from the commencement as the sixteenth century."], [75, "45 II. RELIGION. Religious superstition, which had tormented all these nations in a greater or less degree, began to moderate in some of them ; and enlightened men Avere met Avith in every country who opposed it Avith effect. The doctrine of the Vaudois and that of the Albigenscs. in France, were not for gotten. Wicklisse had raised his voice in England, and had been heard. The Hussites, and their soccess in Bohemia, have been mentioned .above. Every prince bore the insolence and ambition of the Roman Pontiff Avith a greater or less degree of impatience. Some of them dared to oppose it openly, and the university of Paris had, more than once, been made the organ of sovereign power to answer the menaces of Rome. They had the courage to appeal to a future council, which they, Avithout ambiguity, deemed superior to the Pope. Other princes, Avhether from conviction or po licy, still bent the knee to Rome, and appeared to make a common cause with the head of the church. Charles V. for example, could not avoid remaining attached to the Hojy See, Avhose support in Italy, a country over Avhich he Avissied to reign, it was his interest to procure. His subjects in Spain, Avhere the Inquisition had been lately in troduced, and where the long terror inspired by"], [76, "46 the Moors had kept the people in the most super stitious Catholicism, would instantly have revolted against him had he appeared a less zealous ca tholic than themselves. The countries which possessed a republican constitution, and which maintained in themselves a greater inclination for liberty, were also those least timid towards Rome. It is known with what noble firmness the senate of Venice con stantly opposed a bulwark to its usurpations. There are some cantons, essentially republican,. of Holland, Holstein, and of all LoAver Germany, which have never been really papists, and which the reformation found ready reformed. Besides, the eyes of men began to open. The impolitic violence of some Popes ; the scandalous life of others; the ssiameless licentiousness of their court, and their capital ; the corrupt manners ofthe clergy ; the ignorance and effrontery of se veral orders of mendicants, the faithful satellites of the Holy See ; the seventy years captivity at Avig non ; the schism of forty other years which fol lowed it, in which two and sometimes three Popes appeared, each having a party, abusing and excommunicating each other, loading each other with the most revolting insults, and reproaching each other Avith the lowest vices; unexpected dis closures which covered both rivals with ignominy at the fame time \u2022 the exactions of every description, but particularly the indulgences, a monstrous abuse of the most monstrous of powers ; the in-"], [77, "47 tolerance and cruelties ofthe inquisition : all these will surely account for the hatred and contempt which every where lurked secretly against the Romissi hierarchy. What then must be the fate of a poAver built solely on opinion, the moment that opinion is withdrawn from it ? To doubt its rights, Avas to take them away ; to probe its foun dations, Avas to sap them ; to examine, was to destroy. The Popes, however, who were perhaps most sensible of the deep wounds inflicted on their kingdom, suffered no outward signs of it to appear, but affected that security which imposes on the mind. They yielded sometimes, and gave way when necessity compelled them ; but they changed their tone as little as possible, ahvays hoping that a better time would come, a time of bigotry and obscurity, in Avhich they could display, in all its magnificence, their obstinate system of Lamaism. The irritable Paul III. as daring as Hildebrand, cited the King of England to appear before him, and, on the refusal of the no less irritable Henry VIII. he declared him deposed from his crown,* * \" Nos Henricum privationis regni incurrisse p\u0153nam declaramus Ejus et complicum, etc. Filii poenarum par ticipes sint. Omnes et singulos Henrici regis, et aliorum pr\u0153dictorum flios nat os et nascituros, aliosque descen dentes (nemine excepto, nullaque minoris \u00e6tatis, autsexus vel ignoranti\u0153, vel alterius cuiusvis causce habita ration*)"], [78, "48 him and his descendants to perpetuity. Pius IV. treated the Queen of Naples in the fame manner; Pius V. pronounced the fame sentence on the proud Elizabeth, of England : and on each of these occasions, the vicar of J. C. displayed, with assurance, his incontestible rights over all crowns and over the whole globe. He disposed of Ame rica as it Avas discovered, and even before it was discovered -,\\ and he had his legion of writers, of digflttdtibus, dominiis, civitatibus, castris, privutos, et ad ilia ac alia in pbsterum obtinenda inluibilcs esse decernimus ct inhabititamus.

This may truly be called pontifical rage ! He is not coutented with pursuing and declaring them infamous to the fourth generation, he stretches to eternity, and strikes the last descendants of the great grandchildren. 4 Nos molu proprio de noslra liberalitate omnes insulas ct terras firmas inventus et inveniendas, deteclas et dclegendas versus occidentem et meridiem, fabricando ct con itruendo imam lineam a polo arctico, scilicet septentrione, ad polum antarcticum, scilicet meridiem, sive sint versus Jn diam, dut versus aliam cjitamcuiiquc partem, qu\u00e6 linea dislet a qualibet insulurum qu\u00e6 vulgariter nuncupantur De Ios Azores y cabo vierde, centum leucis versus occidentem et meridiem ; ita quod omnes insul\u00e6 et terr\u00e6 firm\u00e6 repert\u00e6 et reperiend\u0153 a presold lined versus occidentem et meridiem^"], [79, "49 theologians and civilians who demonstrated with intrepidity, all the sanctity and the proofs of these rights.

Mag?.. T. I. p. 454.) Singular public right of Europe at that time, which was founded on such iu:trumeuts ! It may be observed that the apostolic chancery, which in other respects does not plume itself on its great accuracy in geography, does not ac knowledge any legitimate sovereigns on the earth but Christian princes. All the others may be dispossessed, without even the necessity of giving them notice of it. * St. Thomas, St. Anthony, St. Bonaventure, St. Ray mond, &c. For the same reason, others were invested .with the purple of the bardinals : Turrecremata, Reginald Pole, Albert-Pighius, Sylvestre-Prieiras, Navarrus, Bellarmin, &c f The quality of Roman Catholic had wholly superseded that of man,and even of Christian. He who was not a Roman Ca tholic, was not a man, he was less than a man ; and, were he a sovereign, it was a good action to deprive him of life. This E"], [80, "50 must have gradually alienated the most sensible men from it. Complaints and murmurs arose on every hand; thousands of voices united in de manding a reformation of the church, in iis bead and its members, its faith and its manners : these were the consecrated terms. Three councils in succession, at Pisa, Constance, and Basle, had unveiled the .vounds of this decayed body, and had probed their depth. The falling off and dis content had become more than ever preceptible at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and it Avas in this state of things that the young and vo luptuous Media's ascended the pontifical throne. An admirer ofthe fine arts, from which he sought only fame and gratification, a crafty but presum ing politician, prepossessed with contempt for the German rudeness of manners, under which he was unable to discover that strength and manliness of character, all the energy of which he had to en- was the ordinary language ofthe casuists of Rome, on this sub ject ; I quote, at random, the words of one of them : \" Osten dimusjam satis apertejustum esse, ut h\u00e6reticus occidatur ; quo autem genere mortis sit occidendus, parum ad rem f'acit. Nam quoeunque modo occidatur, semper consulitur enlesiee.\" Al phonsus a Castro. (Dejusld H\u00e6reticorum P<zH\u00ab,.Lib. II. Cap. 12). This- Castro wrote at a time when the commence ment of the reformation might have taught gentlemen of his profession ta have been a little more circumspect. Volumes might be filled with similar passages, and the perusal of them brings to mind the horrible joy expressed by Gregory Xllt. at the news ofthe massacre of St. tiartholomexx."], [81, "51 counter, Leo.X. Avas not qualified to enter the lists Avith Luther-, and the arrogant weakness of the one, opened numberless advantages to the ini trepid firmness of the other. III. KNOWLEDGE. The ignorance which the barbarians ofthe north had brought .yith them, seconded by the wars and continual devastations, which, subsequent to their appearance, desolated Europe, had nearly effaced every trace of improvement. The small portion of instruction Avhich was languidly propagated during several centuries of the middle age, was only found among the ecclesiastics, and principally in cloisters-. It was in these sanctuaries, which were frequently respected by the ferocious comba tants, who respected nothing else, that a few ma nuscript books were copied and preserved, the annals of the time were written, a mixture of theology, most frequently extravagant, but some times astonissiing by its subtlety and its happy elucidations, of logic, and of metaphysics, almost wholly disfigured and misunderstood, was taught. It will be obvious that scholastic divinity, which has had so many periods and such various fates, is alluded to: a desert uninhabitable by common fense, but here and there presenting fertile spots, e 2"], [82, "52 on which the hand of beneficent nature may hi recognized, and the mind d .veils with enchant ment. If churchmen preserved the slight tradition of knowledge in this manner, it must also be confess ed that, in their hands, it sometimes became dangerous, and Avas converted to pernicious uses by its depositaries. The domination of Rome, erected upon a scaffolding of false historical proofs, required the aid of these faithful auxiliaries, who, on the one side, were to employ their half-know ledge in fascinating every eye, and, on the other, to prevent these eyes from discovering the true light, or being illuminated by the torch of criti cism. The local usurpations of the clergy, being, in many places, founded on similar ndes, stood in reed of similar means of support. It therefore sol lowed, that the small portion of knowledge which was permitted, must have been mingled with errors, and that nations must have been kept in profound ignorance, the foster-parent of superstition. Study was rendered as inaccessible as possible to the laity: that of the ancient languages Avas treated as a monstrosity and an idolatry. The reading of the holy writings, that sacred patrimony ofall Chris- tians, was-particularly and severely interdicted : to read the Bible, Avithout permission ofthe superi ors, Avas a crime : to translate it into the vuSar tongue was a temerity deserving of extreme pu- nissiment. The popes had very good reasons for preventing the Avords of Jesus Christ from reaching"], [83, "53 the people, and for interrupting the direct com munication between the gospel and the Christian. When objects of such importance as public belief and public worship are kept in mystery by com-. pulsion, the darkness must be universal and im penetrable. The numerous legions of mendicant monks not being sufficient for this purpose, the horrible inquisition was devised, to extinguish every spark of knowledge which might appear through the gloom of night, in blood and in tears. But the efforts of man cannot prevail eternally against the course of nature. The dawn must in fallibly appear ; the day must follow, and, with its rays, illuminate the phantom of darkness, which had become, at once, the ridicule and the admiration of mankind. The university of Paris already had offsetts and rivals worthy of it, in Germany and in England. That of Wittemberg where Luther and MelanSlhon first came into no tice as professors, had been lately founded. Princes, carried away by the general spirit, by an emulation of glory, by the ravishing splendor of so many new lights, promoted this regeneration by such establishments. It became impossible to impose silence on so many schools, which sought celebrity by striving to excel each other. The ancient lan guages, history, criticism, were publicly taught in them, notwithstanding the clamours ofthe par- tizans of ignorance. In them science was libe rated from its leading-strings, and broke, by de-"], [84, "54 grees, its antiquated paction with error. A com merce with distant countries, the knowledge of a new world, had disposed men to receive new ideas. The art of printing, an incalculable advantage to the human race, and the highest which the mind ever received from industry, lately invented in Germany, on the banks of the Rhine, multiplied knowledge to infinity, and took away all means of hiding it, from thenceforward, under a bussiel. 4,A.t the other extremity of Germany, on the banks of the Vistula, Copernicus had been examining the heavenly bodies, and unveiling their true courses, which the pontifical bulls have not been since ca pable of altering. On investigating the history of the early years of the sixteenth century, it is im possible to avoid considering this period as one of the most decisive for the improvement and ame lioration of our species. During this first conflict between light and dark ness, both parties became more inflexible, more fixed in their opinions, and prepared for the en counter. At the head of the party friendly to knowledge, the public opinion had placed the spirited Erasmus of Rotterdam. His keen satires against the dissoluteness of the clergy, and against monastic stupidity, had produced a lively sensa tion. He contributed powerfully to the birth of a taste for erudition and criticism. Reuchlin, a philologist and very learned writer, who had taught in almost every part of Europe, was, at that pe riod, settled in his native country, Germany, and"], [85, "55 excited an enthusiastic eagerness for the study of languages, particularly Gret-k and Hebrew, for reading the sacred works in the original, and for the illustration of the Bible. The theologian-in quisitors of Cologne, and, among others, the fiery Dominican, Hochflraten, who had solicited and ob tained an imperial edict, commanding the burning and exterminating of every Hebrew book, entered into a dispute with Reuchlin, and endeavoured to demonstrate that the study of Greek, as well as of Hebrew, was pernicious to the faith.* Perhaps, according to their mode of judging, they were * Even the faculty of theology of Paris, about this time, maintained before the Parliament, \" that religion was undone, if the study of Greek and Hebrew was permitted.\" The men dicant monks held a very different language ; on this subject one ofthe private soldiers of the army of Hochstraten gives the following explanation. It is Conrad de Heresbach, a very serious and very respectable writer of this period, who employs the true terms ofa monk ; \"a new language has been invented, which is called Greek ; guard carefully against it, it is the mo ther of every species of heresy. I observe in the hands of a great many people, a book written in this language, which they call the New Testament, it is a book full of thorns and serpents. With respect to Hebrew, it is certain, my dear brethren, that all who learn it are instantly converted to Ju daism.\"' \u2014 Here is a specimen of the spirit of papacy during thi: century. Would it have been right or proper to have suffered it to proceed thus unobstructed .?"], [86, "56 tight, and every species of study was dangerous to the inquisition, and to the power which em ployed such auxiliaries. However that may be this dispute made a prodigious noise, and termi nated by covering the abettors of ignorance with shame. The Hebraists triumphed, Ulricb de Hut ten, a young gentleman of Franconia, warm and of great talents, a warrior, poet, scholar, and also theologian, on this occasion wrote the celebrated Letters from obscure Men (Epistola virorum obfeu rorum),a satire replete with spirit and point, which brought indelible disgrace on the opposite party. Reucblin, and some others, were suspected of hav ing contributed to them. Such were nearly the principal features in the picture of Europe, in respect of politics, religion, and intellectual improvement, at the time of the reformation. THE REFORMATION. Catholicism was not a religion which had been given, completely formed, and at once, to a new people, where it might have acquired a uniform aspect. Christianity, introduced at dif ferent times, into nations which differed greatly, had received a local modification from each, aris ing from the peculiar disposition of the nation. Thus the Roman language, introduced into the"], [87, "57 several countries of the empire, here met with the language of the Goths and Lombards ; there, with that of the Celt\u00e6 and Teutonic ; in other places, with the Gallic, Saxon, or Cantabrian; and thus gradually became Italian, French, Eng lish, or Spanissi. Christianity itself, during its successive transmutation into Roman Catholicism, changed in its essence by the innovations of the court of Rome, and of the monks and theologians, did not every where undergo uniform variations. With a fundamental similitude in the principal dogmas, it acquired a different physiognomy in different places. Thus, even in our own times, the Catholicism of Madrid does not entirely agree with that of Paris; nor is that of Rome similar to that of Vienna. In some places it had acquired a greater tendency to superstition, a form more overloaded, more material, more calculated to stifle the spirit : in others, on the contrary, it was less clogged with material bonds, and had preserved more of a disposition to mysticism; the spirit had remained more free, and more per ceptible. These varieties in the character of the religion proceeded from those in the characters of the nations ; some were more sensual, more dissi pated, more exterior, if the term may be ad-, mitted ; others, on the contrary, more reflecting, more serious, mere retired. Italy, on the one hand, and Saxony, on the other, will furnissi us with an instance of this diversity ; and it is natu ral to select these two countries, since one was"], [88, "58 the seat of Catholicism, and the other became that ofthe reformation. Italy had long been the residence of the chiefs of the Roman empire. The luxury and the cor- ruption of the Asiatics had penetrated into the city of the C\u00e6sars, and into the rest of the coun- try. The riches of the whole world abounded and circulated there. The effeminacy of the lat- ter time ofthe empire fixed the Italian character. Subdued afterwards by a number of conquerors, who succeeded each other without intermission, this fine country was, for ten centuries, the theatre of continual wars between foreigners, who came there to contend for it. The Italian, never master of his own territory, always oppressed and subjugated, naturally became deceitful, cunning, dissimulating, selfissi. Commerce constantly en- riched him ; but he hastened to consume, in en joyment, the wealth which he foresaw might soon be snatched from him by violence. A taste for luxury, pomp, and voluptuousness, with that of the fine arts, became his consolation. The mag- nificence of the ancient ruins which surrounded him, influenced that which he gave to all his works, to all his religious edifices. Worssiip be- came the business of the fenses, and religion a mythology ; splendid ceremonies superseded sim- ple prayers ; saints and images became the inter- cessors with an almost forgotten God, and the immediate objects of devotion. No doubt the populace, and uninformed men, would adhere"], [89, "59 very strongly to this system of superstition, which captivated their senses, and lulled all their vices : but what wonder if he, who began to think and examine, ssiould at once and entirely reject this system, where he could discover only the work of man, and that he should remain without a spark of religion ? It was a necessary consequence that the Italian must be a papist or an atheist; he must either adore our Lady of Loretto, or not adore at all : hence there never was so many atheists as in the country and neighbourhood of the sovereign pontiffs * The most violent bigotry, or the in credulous libertinism of Aretin, is the inevitable lot of those who no longer give credit to all their religion, or no longer discern its spirit. An old proverb says : \" When the water of the bath is thrown out of the window, the child is thrown * We may add to these the reasons given by Machiavel, an eye-witness, for the Italian impiety and corruption ; and it will not be denied that he had sufficient penetration to see very clearly from what the evil arose. He expresses himself thus: \" The greatest prognostic of the approaching ruin of Christia nity is, to fee that the nearer people are to Rome, which is the capital of Christianity, the less devotion they have. The scan dalous examples, and the crimes of the court of Rome, have occasioned Italy to lose entirely every principle of piety, and every sentiment of religion. The rest of us Italians have there fore this first obligation to the church and the priests, for hav ing become impious and profligate.\" \u2014 Disc, sur la prem. De~ tade de Tite-Lite, lib. i. chap. 12."], [90, "60 with it.\" A religious reformation was impossible in, this country. Those who were good catholics would not have permitted the removal of a single relick; those who were not, were nothing ; they acquiesced in the external forms, but had neither moral nor religious interest in them, nor had they any desire for an amelioration, which they neither thought of or believed in. * What a different appearance was offered by Saxony 1 Its people had never been softened either by luxury and opulence, or by too mild a climate. There, resided an indigenous nation, energetic, open, who, from the ninth century to our era, had never been subjugated. On the banks ofthe Elbe they stopped the flight of the Roman eagles which was unable to penetrate into their pro vinces. In later times this nation had given con querors to Europe; the Angles, the Normans, the Burgundians, the Franks, swarms broke off * The Italians proved clearly by the event, that they were wholly incapacitated for a reformation. Some years before Luther, the ardent Savonarole preached nearly in the fame manner at Florence, as the Saxon reformer preached after wards, against the indulgences, the misconduct of the papal court, &c. The infamous Alexander VI. reigned at that pe riod : far from declaring for Savonarole , as the people of Wit temberg declared for Luther, those os Florence fell upon the unfortunate, but too honest man for his time und his country, dragged him to the pile wliich was kindled by she executioners (>f the inquisition, and saw him burnt, uttering exclamations of joy, and crying \u2014 Long live Pope Borgia !"], [91, "61 from Saxony, had subdued Great Britain, Gaul, and other provinces of the west. Those who continued on their own territory, attached to their ancient and simple national worship, had allowed the remainder of Europe to embrace Christianity, without being tempted to imitate it, and to quit a creed, with which was interwoven the memory Of the illustrious actions of their forefathers. When, after a desperate resistance of three-and thirty years, Charlemagne succeeded in compelling them to receive Christianity, they adopted it with sincerity and simplicity ; but it may be supposed that it never would become to them what it had become to the Italians. Here it attracted the eye less, and affected the heart more: there it was more Of worship ; here it was more of religion. Serious men, of manners generally pure, naturally prac tised a purer and more spiritual Christianity. They always bore the yoke with which the court of Rome had burthened them with secret impa tience, and they threw it off on the first opportu nity which offered : but, in rejecting this parasi tical covering, which \" was grafted on the gospel, the gospel itself remained to them \u2022 they had not stifled its spirit \u2022 papism was not the total of reli gion to them ; it was still of importance to them to have a religion; an interest in religious con cerns was alive and active in them ; they were capable ofa reformation. The intellectual improvements of the two people differed in the fame proportion. The fine arts, 4"], [92, "62 every thing conducive to the enjoyments of taste, every thing flattering to the sensibility, physical or moral, had become the objects of Italian acti vity. The calm, equal, persevering activity of the Saxons, was directed to the abstract sciences, to philosophy, to historical researches. When the reformation burst forth, there was not a single theologian of Italy capable of encountering those of Saxony ; some of them had the presumption to attempt it, a presumption always the associate of ignorance ; they were defeated, and covered with confusion. In revenge, Italy boasted loudly of her poets and her painters ; site had not produced a Luther, but Saxony had not produced an Ariosto. To the peculiar dispositions which have been indicated, Saxony also joined the indignation and discontent, which was common to it with the rest of Europe. To support the expenses ofa luxu rious court, Leo X. had lately imposed upon Christianity the heavy burthen of a new indul gence. The pretext was the edification of the superb basilick of St. Peter : but a proof that this motive was not, at least, the only one is, that Leo had lately made a present to a greatly beloved sister of the sums which were to arise from the levy on Lower Saxony, as far as the Baltic Sea. This circumstance was known to every body ; and the Dominican Telzel had the audacity to come into the neighbourhood of Wittemberg to open his traffic in indulgences, to advertise his"], [93, "63 Venal mission, and to trust to sermons, so extrava gant, and so gross, as scarcely to be credited at the present day. Martin Luther, a doctor, priest, and Augustine monk, was, at that time, professor of philosophy and theology in the new university of Wittemberg, where an excellent and rigid spirit of assiduity, of love ofthe sciences, of true religion, and of liberty of thought prevailed. Luther's parents were poor; his talents alone had raised him to the situation he filled. He was among the first who applied with ardour to the study of the new knowledge, which was cultivated by the most eminent geniuses of this century. The first rays of the rising fun had no sooner struck the high places, and most elevated summits, than Luther discovered, before the mul titude, the new day which began to break. He devoted all his intellectual powers to the success of reviving letters, watched their progress, and rejoiced at the victory obtained by the partisans of the ancient languages over the inquisitors of Cologne : he had also acquired celebrity by some good productions of this description. Supported by an indefatigable zeal, by a wonderful memory, he had acquired the most perfect acquaintance with the holy writings, the fathers, and other ecclesiastical antiquities. One of his principal objects was to overturn the scholastic divinity, by banissiing Aristotle from the domains of theology, and by demonstrating, from this singular com pound of the logic of pagan philosophy with the I"], [94, "64 doctrine of Christianity, how much the first had been misunderstood, and both had been cor rupted. In every encounter he overwhelmed the scholastics with his arguments and his wit, and covered their science with confusion and ridicule. His individual character, which has had such in fluence on that of the reformation, was energy and uprightness. Ardent and calm, high spirited and humble at the same time; irritable and warm in his language, when provoked by injurious treat ment; mild, and inimical to every species of vio lence in actions ; jovial, open, of ready wit, and even a pleasant companion at the table of the great; studious, sober, and a stoic in himself ? courageous and disinterested, he exposed himself with tranquillity to every risk, in support of what he believed to be the truth. Commanded to ap pear before the diet of Worms, he presented him self there, notwithstanding the terrible and very recent example of John Hufs, with dignity, sim plicity, and firmness. Far from setting Rome at defiance in the outset, he wrote submissively to the pope, and exhibited no other appearance of superiority but that of his immense knowlege over Cajetan and the other theologians, deputed by Rome to convert him. Harassed afterwards with insults and outrages, he replied to them with ani mation : excommunicated by the pope, he pub licly threw the bull of anathema into the fire. Luther knew all the intrinsic weakness and abuses of the pontifical court. He had been sent to"], [95, "65 kome on the business of his order, some years1 before, and there every thing which struck his eye filled his heart with indignation. It is very pro bable that from that time, he secretly conceived, if not the design, at least the wish, for the deli verance of his country; and, like his ancient coun tryman Arminius, who had served in the Roman legions in Italy, before he repelled the fame legions from Germany, it was in Rome that he learned to despise that Rome, which, at a distance, -apw peared so formidable. From such characteristics we- cannot misconstrue one of those superior beings, who, though participating in some of the defects of their age, are made to govern it, and carry it with them on the road to perfection. I may also add that, after having refused the offers of the court of Rome ; after having been so many years the founder and almost patriarch of a new church ; after having been the friend, the adviser, the spiritual father of so many princes, who, through the reformation, had been enriched with all the possessions ofthe clergy, of which he might have obtained a rich ssiare, Luther lived and died in a state bordering on poverty, and left to his wife and children only the esteem due to his name. Such a man must have been filled with indigna tion at the approach ofthe shameless Tetzel. In the sermons, which he usually preached, Luther exposed the abuse of a traffic in indulgences, and the danger of believing that heaven, and the re- r"], [96, "66 mission os all crimes, could be bought with money, while a sincere repentance, and an amended life were the only means of appeasing the Divine Justice. The Dominican answered these sermons with fury : Luther replied ; advanced another step ; called in question the authority of the Pope, and gave th? signal of revolt. Thus began the reformation.* It found a multitude of minds prepared to receive it, and also some enlightened and eloquent men disposed to become its apostles. The learned and * The acrimony with which the fury of parties throws calumny upon men of eminence is well known : Luther ex- perienced this more than any other. For example, it was attempted tsattribute the cause ofhis zeal to the discontent of the Augustins, who, as it was said, were envious, because the Dominicans were intrusted by the Pope with the preaching of indulgences. There is nothing surprising in this fable, the invention of Coclil\u0153us, being given by Maimbourg ; but it is inconceivable how Voltaire and Hume should have repeated it as a certain fact This commission had long become so odious, and so disreputable, that no man, and Luther least ot all, could have envied the Dominicans, who, besides, were almost exclusively in possession of these indulgences, as well as of the inquisition. Doctor Maclaine has added a note to his English translation of Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History, vol. iv. chap. 2,' in which he (hows, beyond dispute, the folly of this imputation. It may not be useless to insert it here, where it has been thought necessary to open the true sources of the reformation, that a more correct judgment may be formed of its nature and its influence. To remove every doubt on Maclainc's authority, as well as on the falsity of the allegation, and to give an example ofa good historical criticism, this note shall be inserted at length at the end of this volume."], [97, "67 moderate Melan&hon, and the hasty Carlstadt, both at Wittemberg ; in Switzerland, Zwingle : in France, Calvin, soon appeared, and communicated their particular opinions to the work of reform. The great majority ofthe German nation, (which must not be confounded with the preponderance of certain governments, such as Austria, &c.) ; that of the Swiss nation ; a very great number of in dividuals in France, Poland, and Hungary ; Den mark, Sweden and England separated in a few years from the Roman church, and refused all obedience as well as all tribute to its head. However, notwithstanding the general disposi- tions already mentioned ; notwithstanding the universally acknowledged want ofa reform in the church; notwithstanding the eloquence and the strength of Luther, this memorable revolution would, doubtless, never have been consolidated, it never would have acquired a political con- sistence, if another interest besides that of religion and truth had not lent it support, and made it an interest of state. The princes of the north of the empire, to whom resistance to ambitious Austria was next to impossible with their ordinary means, saw, in the new enthusiasm cf their people, art unhoped for opportunity of obtaining extraor- dinary succours, ancf'of opposing the whole mass to the imperial arms. An intimate union between each prince and his people, as well as an alliance between the whole of these provinces, and these r 3"], [98, "68 people, which before would have been a chime- rical enterprize, became a necessary consequence ofthe common interest which spoke to all hearts. Besides the temptation of the treasures of the clergy, which each prince added to his own re- venue, the allurement of independence, the grati- fication of an inveterate hatred against the court of Rome, all contributed to force the acquiescence of the chiefs, and to hurry them down the fame torrent with their people. Whatever might have been their motives, it cannot be denied that the league of Smalcald was the first effective union of free princes and states against their oppressors, in modern Europe ; that it laid the foundation of a better conduct, and of liberty of conscience. Some of the reasons which were capable of diverting Charles V. from embracing the reformation have been already mentioned. It was enough for him to see it adopted by those princes of whom he was the natural adversary. Francis I. might have declared for it and introduced it into France. His conduct was guided, partly by his own re- ligious opinion, partly by his politics and his pro jects on Italy. But finding a formidable party arising in the empire against his Austrian rival, he seconded it efficaciously, and with all his power. This is not the place to enter into the detail of the events which have accompanied, followed, and consolidated this memorable revolution. Besides the Institute has demanded its results, and not its I"], [99, "69 progress. It will therefore be sufficient to ob serve, that this important affair almost wholly occupied all the powers of Europe, from the year 1520 to the middle of the following century. Amidst various successes, triumphs, and defeats, alliances and desertions, the Protestant states suc ceeded in giving a constitutional existence to their confession, and in dividing the empire with Catholicism. While Luther lived, he supported the character ofa minister of peace, and employed all his influence to maintain it. The civil war of the peasants of Suabia and Franconia troubled the early days of the reformation. Sects of fana tics were formed in different places, but prin cipally in the circle of Burgundy, and in West phalia. The short reign of the anabaptists of Munster, and of their king, John of Leyden, offered a spectacle of horrid disorders. The Protestants witnessed the excesses of these false brethren with sorrow. Luther and Melan\u00a3lhon wrote against them, and demonstrated that these enormities were, at the fame time, contrary to Christianity and to the true spirit of the reformation. After an almost uninterrupted peace under the four empe rors who succeeded Charles V. during all the re mainder of the sixteenth, and first years of the seventeenth century, the war which kindled fiercely under Ferdinand II. on the subject of the religious capitulations of Bohemia, was soon con verted into a furious struggle between the two parties. The object was no less than the utter"], [100, "70 extirpation of protestantism, the annihilation of the Germanic constitution and liberty, and the absolute dominion of Austria over the empire, \u2022which would have given the means of extending it still further. This horrible conflagration, which, for thirty successive years, ravaged Europe, from the confines of Poland, to the mouth ofthe Scheld, and from the banks of the Po to the Baltic, depopulated whole provinces, annihilated agriculture, commerce, and industry in them, cost the lives of many millions of men, and retarded the study of the sciences in Germany, which, at first, had made such rapid progress, for nearly a century. This fatal war had lasted twelve years, and notwithstanding the prodigies of constancy and valour of the confederate princes, they were on the point of sinking before their powerful ad- versary, when a hero, the successor of Vasa, the immortal Gu/luvtis Adslphus, left his kingdom, at the head of an invincible army, and, at the ex- pense of his own life, which he lost victorious at Lutezn, saved the liberty of Germany, perhaps of all Europe, and the creed which he professed in common with the princes of the Evangelical body, which was the name giveYt to those who had sepa- rated from Rome. Denmark, which had pre- viously been willing to engage in this quarrel, was soon constrained to abandon it. The assistance of Sweden Was more effectual. It is doubtful whether the military annals of any nation offer a period more worthy of admiration than the"], [101, "71 eighteen campaigns of the Swedish army in Ger many. France also joined her victorious arms to those of Sweden, in support of the protestant party : it was in the course of this war that the names of Guebriant, of Puysegur, of Turenne, and Conde, were rendered illustrious, and it was through it that the monarchs of France began to acquire a marked preponderance in the affairs of the empire. France itself, however, had not been wholly free from the internal troubles and commotions which revolutions of such magnitude bring with them. After an obstinate civil Mar between the reformed party and the catholic party, the reign ing dynasty was renewed in the person of a re formed prince, who became, however, a catholic on ascending the throne. Spain, after the abdication of Charles V. had its own kings, to whom the Low Countries were still obedient. But the spirit of the reformation had introduced its ally, the spirit of liberty, among them. The United Provinces threw off the yoke of Philip II. with courage ; and founded, in their morasses, a confederation, very nearly resembling that which had been formed on the mountains of Helvetia. The Hollanders became what a free people near the sea will become, what nature had interdicted to the Swiss : they became rich and powerful, and took rank among the principal states of Europe."], [102, "72 England, amidst troubles, also occasioned by religious innovations, resumed its true destination, that of maritime power. At length the reformation produced the two most celebrated assemblies which the history of modern times affords. The one on the affairs of religion, the Council of Trent, in which so much intrigue, eloquence, and knowledge were displayed, and of which, the decrees, more or less modified, have become the principal basis of the canon law to the states of the Roman communion. The other, political, the Congress of Munster and Ofna- burgh, which put an end to the dreadful thirty \u25a0years war by the treaty of IVestphalia, the master- piece of human prudence and sagacity, which, for the first time, brought the European nations into a connected system of political bodies. It was during the continuance of this long congress that the art of negotiation was brought to perfection, that the necessity for a balance of powers, of a weight and a counterpoise, by which the strong might be restrained, and the weak protected and upheld, was recognized. After this too-rapid view ofthe principal events which immediately followed the reformation, we may hazard a few conjectures on what, most pro bably, would have happened in Europe, if this had not supervened. In fact, a little more pru dence and reserve on the part of the court of Rome, or a little less inflexibility in our reformer, or more indifference on the part of the princes, and,"], [103, "73 perhaps, this great explosion might have been strangled in its birth.

Cottjetltires on nhat might have happened in Europe, if the Reformation had not taken place. Would the Spirit of the Hierarchy have changed ? -llF, in the sixteenth century, and during those which followed it, the torrent of events had pur- sued the same course as it had previously taken, nothing could have saved Europe from an ap- proaching subjugation, from the yoke of an uni- versal monarchy. This danger, although im- minent, was not, however, very perceptible to the .multitude. The people had not made common cause with the princes, against it ; the princes had not made common cause with each other : intrigue and interest had too easily divided them. But by what means could the men, who in those days had almost forgotten they were men, be moved and directed to one common object ? The clergy possessed riches which they sought to re- tain ; the third estate, still little better than bond- men, had their traders and merchants, who sought to enrich themselves. Between these two classes there was another, jealous of both, robbing them sword in hand, wherever it had the power, and against which, these two were obliged to be guarded. Besides, the gentleman was proud of being unable to read, and the clerk was but little"], [105, "75 better instructed. How distant were they from any notion of a police, or a regular society, from the rights common to all men, and from equality with each other 1 How much more dis tant were these ideas from the minds of the pea santry ! These were so igno.-ant and so occupied with popes and clergy, with emperors and no bility, with saints, miracles, and feudal duties, that sound reason, or a consideration of their rights, could find no access to them. Excessive op pression produced, here and there, and at different times, occasional revolts, which, for want of con cert, were of no advantage. Each time some thousands were massacred, and the chains of those who escaped the butchery were rivctted faster. In general, they were ignorant that it was possible to exist in any other way than in performing the corvee* for their lords, and being plundered by the soldiery. Nothing but religion remained, in which there was a common and an active interest of all the classes. The Popes and the Emperors, in the long and obstinate struggle for their claims, had, hap pily, counterbalanced each other during the first centuries, and the efforts of one party had fre quently neutralized those of the contrary party. If the Pope was not as powerful, the House of * 4.1 day's work due from the vassal to his lord, to be done in person, or by his team or plough. T."], [106, "76 Austria met with more obstacles to the subjuga tion of Europe ; while at the same time, but for the resistance of the Emperor, the Pope would have succeeded, with great facility, in constituting himself, without a power of altering it, the great Lama of the west. Thus one evil was long a remedy for the other ; but this struggle could not continue for ever, and one of the two must, in the end, prevail. One Pope had already conceived the idea of placing the Imperial crown on his own head, and an Emperor that of placing the tiara on his. At the accession of Charles V. the power lodged in his hands was so preponderant, that he might easily have triumphed over all his adver saries, and carried the favourite project of his pre decessors, of bringing the whole western Roman Empire under his dominion, into execution. If, by their unity, and by that alone, weak states have been seen resisting powerful coalitions, what might not have been atchieved by so formidable a force, vested in one hand, and with such a leader as Charles V. against Europe divided, and without concert. The policy of this Emperor is so well known that there can be no doubt but he would, in furtherance of this great design, have compro mised with the head ofthe church, and, the more effectually to subdue the other nations, by his means, would have allowed him the second place in the empire, with an unlimited power over con sciences. The holy inquisition was become the tool of both despots, and had, for some centuries."], [107, "77 maintained superstition, political slavery, and slavery of thought, over the whole of Europe. The reformation alone would check this torrent : it, at once, extinguished the ambition of the two projectors, who had aimed at giving chains to Europe. Arrogant Austria is for ever funk and repressed. The Roman pontiff has lost a part of his dominion, and has retained only a precarious power in what is left. Finally, powerful govern ments have arisen : rivals in every thing which can contribute to the glory or welfare of nations, they, for the most part, second the action of the new spirit which animates the people, and strive to efface, by degrees, all traces of the barbarism of the middle age. It is said by some that \" the successive progress of knowledge would insensibly have led to the same results, and have avoided all the evils which arose from so terrible a commotion, and such long wars.\" But they must not have considered that in the system of an infallible church, all the deci sions of which are dictated by the Holy Spirit, a reformation, such as was necessary, becomes im possible, and that it is even contradictory to the spirit of Roman Catholicism. It is also doubtful whether the wistied-for change would have hap pened so soon, or have been so complete. It is certain that, at the time of the reformation, the heads of the Catholic religion, who, at first, saw only fame and gratification, or a disposition to elegance of manners, in the renovation of letters."], [108, "78 and, with these views, had encouraged them, began to perceive their danger, from too great a portion of knowledge being infused into men's minds; and, that a very striking re-action was manifested on their part. This re-action was not soon checked in the states belonging to the house of Austria in Germany, in Spain, in Italy, and in Belgium, where all the means of the inquisition, and of censure, were put in action to sliackle the flight of thought, and to repel the progress of knowledge. Let the political, religious, and li- terary state of the greater part of these countries, during the following centuries, be compared with the state of protestant Germany, Holland, and England, in the fame points of view, and let a judgment be formed, free from prejudice, of what would have been the consequence, if the fame conduct had become universal and despotic in Europe.* * Let the same comparison be made at the present time : in all those countries which were long under the Austrian lash, we /hall find bigotry and superstition, instead of religion and mora- lity ; ignorance and prejudice, instead of sound and solid in- struction; gross sensuality, instead of all the noble qualities which distinguish a man, when he has received a more elevated and more liberal education. Whoever has observed Austria, Spain, and Belgium narrowly, will feel the truth of this remark. There is no doubt but th* universal spirit of our time has pene trated here and there, and given rife to some exceptions.

A very decisive ob servation is that the virtuous and humane Inno cent XI. during a pontificate of twelve years, was scarcely able to execute any of his meritorious designs. The Popes, more prudent since the re- the Austrian yoke, could not be entirely brutalized. A re markable testimony, which exposes the barbarism still exist ing, at the close cf the eighteenth century, in Catholic Ger many, is the narrative of his adventures, lately published by M. Schad, Professor of Philosophy, of the University of Jena, who was formerly a Benedictine in the convent of Banz, from whence, happily for himself, and for that philosophy which he cultivates with success, he escaped. Nevertheless, these monks of Banz passed for the luminaries of Catholic Germany. The excess of their superstition would scarcely obtain credit, were it not related by an eye witness, who was long the victim of it. * It is grateful to me to be able to inita7ice a striking excep tion.

Many attempts have been made to unite the re-i formed church with that of Rome ; the latter has rendered all these endeavours abortive by refusing to relax in any of her claims. Towards the close of the seventeenth century, the Emperor Leopold I. took much pains on this subject, and plenipoten tiaries were named on both sides. The negotia tions also extended into France, between Leibnitz on the part of the Protestants, and Pelijfon and Boffuet for the Catholics. The latter displayed all his eloquence, but, at the fame time, all the. inflexibility of his own mind, and that of his church : according to him, there could not be any question of acommodation, but only of sub mission. When we reflect on the haughty and violent language then held by so enlightened a man as Bossuet was, it is not possible to prevent a beliefs that if, perchance the Romisti clergy should regain their power and wealth, they would become as fanatic and persecuting as heretofore.* * Every year, in the service of Holy Thursday, the Pope still excommunicates and curses all the heretics, and particularly the Lutherans, in these terms : \" Nosigitur, vetustum et solem nem hunc morem sequentes, excommunicamus et anathematisamus ex parte Dei omnipotentis, Patris ct FUH et Spirittts Suncti, ac voftru, omnes h\u0153reticos, nee non damnatum, impiam et ahotni nabilem Martini Lutheri h\u0153refin sequentes, ac omnes fautorct"], [111, "81 The intrigues of the Catholic party to bring bsfcfc the princes of the reformed party to the Roman communion, would be deserving of being known ; such, for example, as those they put in practice with the Elector of Saxony, and with Queen Chris tina, of Sweden. The evil disposition towards those sovereigns who remain separated from Rome is very visible ; and, to this day,* the Holy See et receptatores, librosque ipsius Martini aut quorumvis aliorum legentes, et generaliter quoslibet defensores.\" (Bullar, Mask, Luxemb, 1741, T.I. p. 7 IS.) Who would have thought, after even the most zealous Catholics had blamed the impolitic revocation ofthe edict of Nantes, by Louis XIV. that a prince should still be found in Europe capable of resolving on a proceeding so inhuman and so fatal to his states. The Archbishop of Salz bourg, Baron of Firmian, in the year 1732, afflicted his country with a similar desolation. After unheard of persecutions exer cised on those who were not Catholics, he at length ordered them to quit their country, to the number 30,000, without dar ing to carry any thing away, or to take their families with them. Such an emigration exhausted this small territory. The un happy fugitives were received by the Protestant states of Europe, who pfovided for their subsistence: a great part of them went to people and clear districts in North America, where the descendants of these Salzbourgian Emigrants are still tobe met with. * The reigning Pope has just declared, in a brief-addressed to Prince Rufpoli, that he ought to be considered as tbe supreme head ofall the orders of knighthood : in this he has been guided by the example of his predecessors. In the thirteenth century^ when the Teutonic Knights had conquered Ducal Prussia, and established themselves in it as sovereigns, Innocent IV. declared by a bull, dated 1243, that this conquest belonged, of right ty O"], [112, "82 has not formally acknowledged the King of Prus sia. Long after the Reformation, Clement VU1. his fee. His words are as follows : \" Terram Prussi\u0153 in jus et proprietatem B. Petri suscipimus, et eum sub speciali apostolic\u0153 sedis protectione ac defensionc perpetuis temporibus permanere sancimus . . . . \" {Ada Borrussica. T. I. p. 423). A sovereignty, so well acquired, will not be willingly aban doned. When the Electors of Brandenburgh took the title of Kings of Prussia, and all the powers of Europe, with the excep tion of Spain, acknowledged them in that quality, Pope Clement XI. exclaimed loudly, and wrote to every prince to rouse him against the unheard of temerity of the Marquis of Branden burgh. In the brief of the l6th April, 1701, addressed to tht* King of France, are the following passages : \" Etsi nobis persuasum sit, majest. tuam nullo modo probare consilium, deter. rimo in chistiana republica excmplo, dFriderico marchione Bran deburgensi susceptum, dilm regium nomen publice usurpare proe sumpsit . . . .factum hujus modi apostolkarumsanctionum dispo sitions contrarium,et hujus sanct\u0153 sedis auctoritati injuriosum ... ex quo scilicet sacra regalis dignitas ab homine acatholico non sint tcclesi\u0153 contempts assumitur, et quidem marchio se regem dicert non dubitat ejus partis Prussi\u0153, qu\u00e6 ad militarem teutonico rum ordinem antiquo jure pertinet ; nos rem silentio pr\u0153terire non possumus, ne muneri nostro deesse videamur .... expeti mus, ne videlicet regios honorcs Hit tribuas, qui illorum numero nimis incaute sejunxit, quos increpat simul et reprobat sermo ille divinus : ipsi regnaverunt et non ex me, principes existerunt et non cognoii. ...\" And in the Orationes consistor. Clementis XI. it is seen that this Pope, giving an account of this event, and of his bull to the college of cardinals, relates \" that the Margrave Frederick has arrogated to himself the title of king in a manner at once impious and unheard of among Christians ; it being well known that, according to the ponti fical laws, an heretic prince should rather lose his ancient dig-"], [113, "> 83 prepared the form of an oath to be taken by the bishops and archbishops, in which are laid down riities, than acquire a new one.\" Is not this the language and the principles of Hildebrand, the fame pretensions, the fam\u00ab abuse of passages of the Bible, singularly applied to modern times ? It might, perhaps, be supposed that the Holy See had afterwards retracted this protestation, and acknowledged a mo- narch who treats his Catholic subjects with an exemplary equa- lity of rights. Nothing less. When, in 1782, Pius VI. took a journey into Germany, a Prussian minister used some endea- vours with him to obtain a formal recognition of the crown of Prussia, Pius, who, at that time, did not wise to embroil him- self with a German prince, answered politely, and promised that, on his return to Rome, he would assemble a congregation of cardinals, without whom he could not come to any deter- mination, to deliberate on the subject. This congregation has never been called, and the Pope has forgotten his promise. The pontifical calendar, printed at Rome, with the approba- tion and privilege of the Holy Father, has continued, as before. to make no mention of either the kingdom or the duchy of Prussia, nor even of the electorate of Brandenburgh. In the genealogical table of this house (1783) the great Frederick is thus described: Charles Frederick, (Marchese), Marquis ; a title so trifling at Rome as to be ridiculous. Prince Henry of Prussia is described as brother to the Marquis. Neither is there any mention of an electorate of Hanover in this calen dar. In general, every thing determined on by the odiout treaty of Westphalia is of no value at Rome. The thundering hull of Innocent X. against this instrument of peace to the Chris tian people is well known ; and his successors have, from time to time, renewed these anathemas. In this respect, the pontifi cal court lives outlawed in the midst of Europe, and is sepa rated from the political communion. In 1782, on occasion of some differences relating?7) the Prussian' part of the diocese of 2"], [114, "84 all the principles of the despotism and intole ranocof Rome.* Without prejudice, what could Cologne, the King of Prussia relied on an article of this cele- brated treaty : the Pope replied, in unqualified terms, that the treaty of Westphalia was of no value to him, and could not bind him in any manner, not having been acknowledged by his fee : \"Non pud valutarsi a. quest' oggetto la separazione che si suppone fatta in virtu dell' art.

The fame ca lendar of state, quoted above, under the head ofthe population of Rome, enumerates also the foreigners, and, amongst the rest, states \" Heretics, Turks, and other Infidels, about 100/ \u2014 These are recent facts; and a thousand others might be brought for ward. I ask every impartial judge if they are of a nature to inspire a very great confidence in the voluntary amendment of the system of the pontifical court and of the spirit of papism ? * \" Fidelis et obediens ero domino nostro pap\u0153, ejusque successo ribus.

What would absolute Popes have done, when supported by bigoted and jealous emperors, who would have been united in spirit and interest with Rome ? There is not any thing, therefore, more vague, more uncertain, more destitute of real foundation, than the assurance, gratuitously given by the anta gonists of the reformation, that the renovation of knowledge would, insensibly, have corrected all the abuses in the church and in policy. We most assuredly fee few traces of this pretended amelior ation in the government of the ultramontane states, or of those who have remained most imme- of the conduct of the Holy See. This bull, written in 1610 by Paul V. and promulgated in 1627, by Urban VIII. is a com- plete collection of the anathemas issued centuries ago against those who are refractory to the orders ofthe vicar of J.

It excommunicates heretics, schismatics, pirates, and corsairs; all who dare to appeal to a future council against the bulls and briefs of the Pope, princes who establissi new taxes without the permission of the Pope ; those who make treaties of alliance with Turks or Heretics ; those who complain to the secular judges against the wrongs and injuries received from the court of Rome, etc. etc. These revolting terms were long the law in the Roman dominion, and even in some provinces of France, such as Roussillon and Cerdagne, until, at length, the courageous M. de Cappot, advocate-general to the superior council of Roussillon, in the month of March, 1763, took measures against this abuse ofthe ecclesiastical power, and put a stop to the an nual publication of the bull.

What has, for several centuries, kept our neighbours, the Ottomans, with whom also we have so much commercial intercourse, in a barbarism similar to that of the Christian nations during the middle age? It is religious superstition; it is their muf tis, their faquirs, their dervises, who have kept among them a dislike to true knowledge, and to philosophy. We occidentals had plenty of such opponents, and even worse than the orientals ; we had an inquisition, which they have not, the ter rible reign of which we should, perhaps, have seen perpetuated to our days, but for the reformation. Charming road to a better state of things ! In the sixteenth century, some of the European states, and a great number of individuals, thought it right to take another. The catholic princes., agents of Rome, endeavoured to deprive them of that liberty. They waged a war of extermination against the Protestants who could take up arms : they burnt and massacred, with incredihle fury, those who could not. Then they exclaimed : \" See, of how many evils are those refractory wretches the cause ! What a flame have they kindled in Europe ! They are guilty of all their blood which we have shed, of all the scaffolds which we have prepared for them ! \" Strange recri minations, which many people have given, and still do give credit to ; so easy is it to dose in the career of an established order of things which has endured for centuries !

Is not this mode of considering what might have happened, and what has not happened, in some respects a description of the influence which the reformation has had on the state of things in Europe ? But let us examine, more in detail, what its positive results have been."], [118, "88 PART II. J-NFLUENCB OF THE REFORMATION. FIRST HEAD. On the Political Situation of the States of Europe. Mem Agitat Molem. The active power of thought is superior to the inert power of a mass. Joe fore the reformation, Europe was, in gene ral, subject to two powers, the spiritual and the temporal. On the one hand, the head of the church extended his authority and his pretensions over every state indiscriminately; on the other, a great number of bishops and prelates had be come temporal sovereigns of the flocks, which, at first, were entrusted to their spiritual guidance, and there was not any country in which the clergy, high and low, secular and regular, did not possess considerable wealth and privileges, and enjoy great authority. The church constituted a power ful body which pressed hard upon the political bodies, and, in a greater or less degree, influenced their existence. Hence every remarkable alter-"], [119, "89 ation in the church occasioned a change in the poli tical order : now a revolution which had com menced in the domain of religion, must have exerted its first influence on the church. It is therefore natural to treat first of this, as well with regard to itself and its head, as to its relations, and those of its members, with the different govern ments ; next we shall examine what influence the reformation, considered in a political point of view, has exercised on the states of Europe, both Protestant and Catholic : finally, we shall take an historical view of the system of equilibrium intro duced into Europe since that epocha, of its varia tions, and of the powers which have alternately acted the principal parts in it, until the period at which the influence of the reformation on it ceased.

Still if it had only been a new irruption of barbarians, an earthquake, ah inundation, or, in short, any physical cause which had ravished these delightful possessions from the Holy See ! But it was an active force, a dangerous epidemy, which produced such evils to it. It was nations and princes, who of their own free will, through conviction, had dared, to withdraw themselves in this manner from the pon tifical authority. The example was to be dreaded, both at the time present, and for the time to come. It was easy to foresee that sooner or later this example would be universally followed. The church which had seceded from Rome, subsisted with decency and honour; religion, the Gospel, morals, were respected in it ; the rights which had been arrogated by Rome were allowed their just value in it ; good writings on this subject were every where disseminated ; they were even read in the Catholic countries, and produced an effect on"], [121, "91 them ; and even on the steps of the pontifical throne, more than one ironical sneer contemned the Tiara. It was this which rendered the wound deep and incurable, and which the Popes would not suf fer themselves, at first, to believe, in all its extent. Even after this terrible blow, the pride of Hilde brand and the vices of Borgia were seen, for an in stant, in the Christian worjd. But at length, time and hard experience have convinced them of their real situation ; they are resigned, at least in appear- ance, to the station of humility and of submis sion which has ever since been their lot among the powers of the earth. The Catholic sovereigns, on their part, have from that time considered the Pope as a political spring, to bring into action for the accomplishment of their designs, and as a means for converting the credulity of their subjects to their own benefit : hence the conduct held to him ; but the apparent respect has since then been only idle etiquette. It is too well known that the Vatican is but an extinguished volcano. The spontaneous acts of Rome have had no effect, while a simple courier, secretly expedited from Paris, Vienna, or Lisbon, to this ancient capital of the world, procured, sometimes a bull for the extinction of a religious order, sometimes a reform^ sometimes a regulation, so many proofs of submis- sion given by the weak successor of so many -arrogant pontiffs, who only purchases his preca. rious existence at the price of every complaisance which is required of him."], [122, "92 So considerable a portion ofthe riches and cre- dit of Rome having disappeared, the excessive luxury, the flatterers, the parasites also disappeared by degrees. This gave birth to a reform of man- ners, to a change of life, which was become quite indispensable to the Roman clergy. Those ofthe 'Protestant Church were, in general, poor, learned, and exemplary. So many eyes opened upon the contrast of the two bodies, created an imperious necessity for lessening it, and even for removing it \u2022wholly. Besides the Popes and all the members of the Roman clergy, living in their time, and participating in their lights, would, themselves, have bluslied at a conduct similar to that of many of their predecessors. Those particularly who have silled the functions of pastors in times nearer to our own, have generally lived in the exercise of the most eminent virtues. The head and the clergy of the Romish church have, in a great measure, become what they always ought to have been. It is very true that this church hag com- menced a reform ; but it is also true that this re- form is only an immediate consequence, and per- haps, a compulsory one, of that effected by Lu- tbtr, who, in this view of it, must also be consi- dered as the reformer of the Catholic clergy. What has been just said of the weakness and humiliation of the Roman clergy, must not, as has been already observed, be understood of the time immediately subsequent to the reformation. Since the political troubles which arose in Europe,"], [123, "93 in consequence of it, had all a religious character, and originated in religious disputes, it is natural that the ecclesiastics should act an important part in them, and that princes should consider them as necessary agents in these affairs, and employ their counsels and their ministry. In fact, during this period, we find a number of churchmen holding the principal situations, and becoming of weight in , the state. The fa mous Council of Trent, which occupied and agi tated every court, from 1545 to 1563, also ren dered ecclesiastics indispensable in the cabinets of their sovereigns. On the other hand, the high opinion at that time entertained of the refined po litics of the Roman court, was a prejudice very favourable to priests of every description. The political importance which was acquired by some members of the clergy, could not but affect the whole body in a degree, and doubtless the church is indebted to it for the consolidation and mainte nance of many of the rights which it would have lost from that time. Many of the violent measures entered into by sovereigns, and of which the history ofthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries offers nu merous examples, also arose, without doubt, from the inquisitorial zeal of such counsellors. Never theless some of these priest-ministers conducted themselves more as servants of the state, than as servants of the altar, and the minister sometimes got the better ofthe priest. At length, this last period of sacerdotal importance vanished. It was 2"], [124, "94 annihilated in an instant, after the treaty of West phalia, where religion ceased to be the main spring: of politics, and the action of governments was di rected by other principles; such for example, as a financial and commercial spirit, the influence of which still continues, and may continue for a length of time. To the fame motives may be attributed the rapid elevation and immense credit of the new order of Jesuits, who, born by the side of Protes- tantism, and, at the same time, were destined from their birth to combat and counterbalance it. These new soldiers of the church, constituted in a much more formidable manner than the army of mendicants, raised in the barbarous ages, and in- ventors ofa system of tactics much more suitable to the spirit ofthe new one, did every thingfor the enfeebled church which could be hoped for from human powers, directed by the most profound prudence, zeal, perseverance, genius, and a combi- nation of talents. They got possession of courts, of nations, of confessionals, of pulpits, ofthe edu- cation of youth, of missions, and of the desarts of the two worlds. Nothing appeared to them im- possible in extending the dominion of the Holy See to places where it did not exist, or in consoli- dating it where it was still maintained. In pur- suit of this object they dreaded neither persecu- tions nor calumnies. Represented as ambitious, fomentors of troubles, corrupt men, and even as regicides, by their adversaries, they opposed the 5"], [125, "95 stoical severity of their lives, their real services, and their studious austerity, to these accusations. This is not the place to enter into the detail of the movements produced in the politics of Europe by this celebrated society, the influence of which. arose only from the reaction of Catholicism against the reform. It is sufficient to observe, that if the latter could have sunk, and experienced a counter revolution, the Jesuits would doubtless have ef fected the great work. So far from this, that the enemy, whom they flattered themselves they could crush, gave them the mortal blow : the genius of modern times declared against the spiritual tyran ny of Rome, and, formed by the reformation into an effective power, has reduced those audacious defenders of papism to a nonentity. To con summate, and, at the same time, to bear testimony to the humiliation of his party, it was necessary that the Pope himself mould be compelled to dis card them. A victim to the general spirit of hu manity, which in its progressive advancement de crees the ruin of every institution inimical to it, Ganganelli signing with humid eye the bull for the extinction of the Jesuits, was only the pre cursor of the unfortunate Louis XVI. who, in less than twenty years after, was forced to send away his army, his nobility, his guards. Whoever re flects on history cannot withhold admiration from a society which has constantly shown such cou rage, concert, perseverance, and address in its plans : while acknowledging the ill it may have"], [126, "96 done, he will be unable to avoid doing justice to all of great or useful which it has produced. Its radical vice, and the principle of its destruction, lay in the institution itself. Destined to support the edifice of the hierarchy, which imperceptibly mouldered away, on every side, the hand of time, and opinion which guides it, must necessarily overturn this last rampart, attached to a vast ruin which nothing could uphold.* The aspect of the clergy in the countries which have adopted the reform, is totally different, its members do not wish to be other than what they can, and ought to be, the ministers of the word of God, the guardians of the public morals. Freed from all obedience foreign to the country from which they receive their stipend, become husoands, fathers, citizens ; they have no longer any interest but that of the state in which they live. They * Some individuals, animated by a blind zeal, still make weak and vain efforts to revive the order of Jesuits. They will not succeed. A moral impossibility opposes them. Their or der was a natural product of the time in which it arose : to the present time, it can only be a foreign and parasitical plant, which must wither for want of nourishment. Our age cannot acknowledge the sons of Loyola for its children. A few retreats, in which their feeble remains may be concealed, where they may secretly propagate superannuated principles, will be their only reliance. They must never more quit them to domineer over opinion, and through it, over the world : it is opinion which will wound them there, and will change even lhe spirit oi their sectaries."], [127, "97 are appointed either by the prince, or by the ma gistrate, or by the people : Luther brought the Saxon church, in what relates to its internal government, to the democracy of the first age, and the hierarchy to a moderate system of subordi nation. The churches which have followed Cal vin are still more democratically constituted. But the clergy no longer form a civil corporation in any of them. Some public marks of honour and deference are the only privileges of the ministers. According to the words of their master they give unto C\u00e6sar that which is C\u0153jar's, by rendering unto God that which they owe him. The aboli tion of auricular confession* cuts off, at one stroke, the infinite ramifications by which the hierarchical despotism had taken root in all partsr and deprives the clergy of their incalculable in fluence over princes, grandees, and women, and over all families. The constitution of the church, in Denmark, in Sweden, and more especially in England, has continued more conformable in appearance to the Roman hierarchy, for reasons peculiar to these three countries, and which are to be found in their history.

The puritans, prefby terians, and others, had given sufficient indications of republicanism, to alarm their princes for the consequences of this spirit, so nearly connected with that of Protestantism. The favourite motto of the Stuarts, \" No Bishop, no King, \" is well known. Thus these kingdoms have retained Protestant bishops, who enjoy moderate revenues, and some civil prerogatives attached to their situ ations, as being members of the states, or of the House of Peers, etc. But these prerogatives are in dividual, and it would be wrong to suppose from this circumstance, that the clergy still forms a dis tinct order in these nations.* In some parts of Germany the principal guardians of worship are called general-super intendants \\ Ecclesiastical affairs are discussed by tribunals, called consistories. They are establislied by the prince, and it is by no means uncommon for their president to be a layman ; as, for example, in the free towns, it is the syndic of the senate.

In the Protestant countries, the immense vacuum occasioned by the sudden cessation of all ecclesias tical authority and jurisdiction, was immediately filled by the civil power, which increased in pro portion. In the Catholic countries, the church, terrified and menaced, also gave some ground to the authority of government. The wars, both ci vil and external, which, in most states, were the consequence of the religious animosity, in the end, enabled princes to render their power unlimited, as will be shown in speaking of each state in particular. A proximate consequence of the reformation, and of the oppositions, the actions, and reactions, it set in motion, was also the establishment of va rious sects of Christianity as dominant religions in the countries where they had taken root. For merly, when only one communion was known, such an idea could not have existed. Papism go verned by its own power, and not by the law. When heretics were persecuted, it was not by a law of the state, but by a requisition from the Pope, to whom the prince gave his aid. One effect ofthe reciprocal jealousy and opposition of these sects was to exclude from all the places of state, and frequently, even from the throne, all h 2"], [130, "100 who did not profess the fame faith, or had nor the fame creed, as that adopted by the bulk ofthe nation and by the government. From this le gal arrangement arose a new species of intole rance, which, hitherto, had remained unknown, and which was established in the different Protes tant communions, as well as among the Catholics. Hence the revocation of the edict of Nantes and the civil disability which weighed so heavily on every citizen of a confession different from that which was predominant. In some catholic countries this disability amounted to a civil death. A reformist could not possess goods in his own right, nor bequeath them, nor marry, nor have legitimate children ; happy if he was not hunted by dragoons, and did not perish by their hands.. or by those of the executioner: for it roust be confessed that the Catholic states pushed this in tolerance much farther than the most intolerant reformists. Finally, there are very few of the states of Europe that have adhered to the Holy See, in which it has retained all its prerogatives. Venice and Portugal have always shown themselves re fractory ; and so has Spain, at times. A multitude of Protestants, Socinians, and Dissenters of every confession, have sprung up in Poland, Hungary, and Austria* It has been the fame in the eccle siastical principalities of Germany. In France, besides a very great number of individuals who have adopted the reform, the kings and the par-"], [131, "101 liaments have, on many occasion:., shown them selves but little favourable to the ultramontane pretensions; and, in more instances than one, the monarchs have threatened Rome to follow the example of Henry VIII. The courageous Gallican church has had more than one worthy successor of Gerson and Richer-, and it has required great management to keep it an integrant part ofthe patrimony of St. Peter. The council assembled at Trent to reconcile all the church of Christ, only marked its divisions more strongly. This assembly issued a multiplicity of decrees which the greater part of the Catholic states did not adopt without great modifications, and which soon fell into disuse, for want of a power to enforce their execution. This council, which was to reinstate the Popes, pro duced Sarpi's book, which has done them more harm than ten councils can remedy. M. de Mar ~ca, Archbishop of Toulouse, in his Treatise De concordid facerdotii et imperii, and more especially M. de Honlhiem, suffragan Bishop of Treves, in his work,* published under the feigned name of Justinus Febronius, have completed what Sarpi so happily began. The successive efforts ofthe chris tian states to attain independence, are connected by an uninterrupted chain with those of the first reformers. Thus we1 must consider, as conse- * De stat a Ecclesi\u0153 et legit Ama potestate Romani Pontificis. Ad conciliandos dissidentes in Religione chrittianos.

JtdLERE a double point os view manifestly offers itself; that of the interior situation of the differ ent states in themselves, and that ofthe exterior si tuation in respect of each other. The first must exhibit the proportion of their strength; that of their prosperity ; the power of their princes ; the liberty of the people : the second relates solely to the system of equilibrium introduced into Eu rope since the reformation. FIRST POINT OF VIEW. Internal Situation of the States. The influence of the reformation has been more perceptible on the states in which it arose, and ac quired consistence, than on those which have not adopted it. It therefore appears natural to begin here with the former. And in the first place, let us attend to their common destinies, as Protestant slates. I. FROTEST4.NT STATES. The immense sums which, under every name and pretext, these states sent continually to Rome, and which exhausted their currency, have ceased to leave the country: they circulate in it; they give a new activity to commerce and industry ; a 4"], [134, "104 .new prosperity to the subjects ; and an increase of strength to the government ; while, on the other hand, public credit experiences temporary checks in them. Treasures are concealed or buried, from a dread of the future, the standard of coin is changed, emigrations become frequent, the inse curity which is a consequence of the uncertainty of a triumph of parties, lessens the credit of landed property ; money being more transportable, is in greater estimation than it ; but man, in himself, more particularly acquires a price superior to both of them : his intrinsic value being more use ful is more felt, and becomes the most esteemed of all property. This is one of the best effects of these terrible commotions which, deranging all rights, the off spring of social institutions, leaves, in their stead, only greatness of soul, virtue, and talents, the pro duce of nature alone. The immense possessions ofthe clergy, as well secular as regular, are placed at the disposal of the governments. Most of them wisely turn this good fortune to advantage, pay their debts, fill their cof fers, apply the property of whole abbies, and other ecclesiastical possessions, in useful establish ments, in schools, universities, hospitals, orphan houses, dwellings and rewards for the old servants of the state; measures, by which this property is restored to its primitive destination : and finally these governments are placed ih a state to sup port the wars, in which every one sees that the"], [135, "105 existing crisis must inevitably plunge them. Some of them, however, dissipate the wealth they have acquired, without thought ; others are obliged to leave the better part of it to the nobility, Den mark for instance, as will be noticed hereafter. Governments not only dispose of the wealth ot the church, but they also find that they have the disposition of the wealth, the persons, and all the strength of the people. The cause of religion is become that ofevery individual: the resources which this disposition offers to princes are incalculable. We have seen what it was able to effect in the first war against Charles V. and afterwards in the thirty years war against the two Ferdinands. What the most imminent danger of the state could not have obtained from <:he individuals of it, religious zeal brought about without difficulty : for it, artizans, tradesmen, farmers ran to arms ; no one attempted to screen himself from the taxes though they had become triple their former amount. In the violent agitation in which the danger of their religion had put all minds, life and property were devoted, and the efforts and the burthen, which in a state of greater tranquillity, would have been insupportably distressing, were not felt. The dread of an inqui sition, of the scenes of St. Bartholomew, opened sources of power to the league of Smalcald, to the Prince of Orange, to Queen Elizabeth, to Ad miral Coligny, which would have been closed in every other state of things. When once a people of their own accord, enthu-"], [136, "106 siastically, and for several successive generations, have made common cause with their princes, a pub- lic spirit of concert and harmony is produced between the people and the government, between the head and the members, which is salutary to the country, \u00bbnd is sometimes continued in it for ages. We cannot err with respect to this disposition in the Protestant nations, if we examine them narrowly ; and the histories of them, that of Prussia in par ticular, exhibit many instances wherein it was ma- nifested. But if through his quality of head ofthe church, and through the confidence of his people, a Pro testant prince acquires more stability and more authority, the very nature of the event which puts this new power into his hands, requires that he should make the most legitimate and most equitable use of it. He has only acquired power to serve and to defend the nation, not to oppress it. The most accurate observers have noticed, that nature has particularly fitted the people of the North to be republicans ; and it cannot be denied that several of those who have embraced the reformation have always been actu ated by this spirit, as for example, the Saxons, the Swiss, the Dutch, and the English: it may even be said, that the reformation itself was only a positive application of it. This shock in its turn, awakened all the energy and the accessory ideas of it. The will to be free in matters of conscience, is, at the bottom, the fame as the will to be free in civil matters. Now this will can ac-"], [137, "107 complish all that is required, and there are no slaves, but those who wish to be so, or who have not the strength of will to put an end to it. The energy of men's minds at length constitutes true liberty, as their effeminacy makes tyranny necessa ry. The calm and sober sentiment of the high dignity of man, is the only solid foundation of true republicanism ; it is by it alone that equality of rights, and reciprocity of duties are established. Christianity, in the purity of its essence,, inspires this sentiment; for which reason it is very common and general, in the evangelical countries. The consti tution of England has been much admired, I shall not dispute on its value; but that\u00bbwhich renders this uncouth constitution so good, is the patriotism, the dignity, the inoependence of the peasant, the citi zen, the gentleman of England. Introduce the senti ments of slaves into all those hearts which nowswell with freedom, and you will soon see the use of this fine palladium ofa constitution. Prussia and Den mark have no parliaments, nor any visible barriers to the royal authority, yet they enjoy the [most admirable liberty, but there, the invisible barriers are in the mind, even in that of the prince, nursed and trained in the spirit which animates the na tion ; they are in the great simplicity of manners, the most remote from luxury and pride. There we see powerful princes habited like their sub jects, going like them on foot or in a plain carriage, without attendants, without etiquette ; during their youth, simple officers in the national army which fc^"], [138, "108 they are one day destined to command. What mo dern state can boast of a king like the immortal Frederick II. what nations ofa union of princes so distinguished and so wise, as the Protestant nations of Germany ? Sweden instances with pride the four Guftavuses. Two extraordinary women, Elizabeth and Catherine have filled thrones in Europe during the last centuries; both of them were reared inthe principles of Protestantism. Finally, can France forget that the best of her kings, and the best mi nister of that king, were both disciples ofthe re form. Having spoken of this disposition ofthe public spirit amongst the Protestants, ought I to notice here the progress they have made in the science of legislation, and the other sciences connected with it, such as administration, statistics, &c? or, should I reserve these considerations for the section in which I am to treat ofthe progress of know ledge? The uncertainty which I feel in this respect proves that every thing that concerns man, in soci ety, has a very intimate connexion, and that the great business of his liberty depends very closely upon the true culture of his mind. It will be therefore sufficient to observe that the ecclesiastical authority being, before the re formation, closely interwoven with the civil autho rity in many places, and wholly blended with it in many others, it was impossible to probe and dis-"], [139, "109 cuss the rights ofthe one, without the examination being extended to the rights of the other. It was asked, by what authority the popes claimed the power of setting up, and dethroning kings : thi* naturally led to an inquiry into the first authority by which kings were instituted. These respective rights of the church and state being brought into discussion, it was not possible to touch on this im portant question, without a speedy recurrence to the rights of the people. It was found that socie ty, considered as a religious union, that is to fay, as a church, had a right of choosing its ministers, and fixing its creed : it was very easy to conclude from this, that, with regard to its political union, it had also a right to elect its own magistrates, and to give itself a new constitution. The emperor opposed the new religious creed; it was, therefore asked, whether in matters of belief the emperor ought to be obeyed. In 1531, the faculty of right, and that of theology of the uni- versity of Wittemberg unanimously replied inthe negative. From thence forward, there was no- thing but debates on the limits of .obedience due to sovereigns, and on those ofthe resistance which might be offered to them.

Some of the principal ones will be noticed in one of the articles of the second section. The reformation, therefore, which, at first, was only a return to liberty in the order of religious affairs, became, for all these reasons, also a return to liberty in the political system. Princes relied on this liberty, they sought it, and em braced it, as well as their subjects. For this rea son the Protestant sovereigns have constantly held a different language towards their people; they have professed other principles of liberality and humanity, than the Catholic sovereigns, their cotemporaries. Their people have been- long fa miliarized to the language and the principles of rea son : they know that it is the basis of their govern ments, and they are accustomed to the discussion of their interests and their rights, which produees no emotion in them ; the liberty of thinking and writing is as- natural to them as the air they breathe. This may induce a reasonable belief that a political revolution, similar to that of France, is not practicable in the states which are not Catholic : the most essential results of such a revolution are already completely establisoed in them, and cupidity cannot now be stimulated by the possessions of the church. Consequently there are no people more submissive to their princes and to the laws of their country than the Protestants, because these laws are conceived in a right spirit; princes and subjects are equally"], [142, "112 patriots and republicans, and every one know* by experience the moderate medium proper to be kept between speculative democracy and practical democracy. It is asserted that, at first, Francis I. appeared very favourable to the doctrine of the reformers of the church.* His beloved sister Margarets Queen of Navarre, protected it publicly. At that instant, the fate of the kingdom depended on the party which he should embrace. If he had adopted the reform, all France would have fol- lowed his example : the fate of Protestantism, in Europe, would have been sooner decided ; the civil wars in France would doubtless not have taken place, nor would the revolution of the eighteenth century. Every thing assumed a contrary aspect, because the prince conceived lively apprehensions of the political consequences of the reformation. Brantome relates that one day, in a conversation on this subject, the king accidentally said \" That this novelty tended prin cipally to the overthrow of monarchy, both divine and human, -j-\" In fact, this prince showed, in the * He even wrote to Melancthon to request him to come to Paris. Melancthon was unable to comply with this request because the Elector of Saxony refused his permission. tDid not Francis 1. imbibe this opinion from ecclesiastical insinuations?

But if Francis 1. thought in this manner, is it hot permitted to take his' opinion for an autho- rity, and to consider the establistiment of the French republic as a remote, but necessary, co rollary to the reformation, as the republic of the United Provinces was a proximate corollary, and that of America another, nearer than ours ? In some of the extravagant sects which arose from the reformation, such as that of the Anabap tists, we may observe the same pretensions to absolute equality and liberty, as occasioned all the excesses of the Jacobins of France : the agra rian law, the pillage of the rich, made part of their creed, and war with the castles, and peace to the cottages, might have been inscribed on their en signs. At first these enthusiasts gave great unea siness to the princes of Germany. Luther was much hurt at their excesses, and frequently re proached himself with having, though innocently, siven rise to them. However they were soon re-\u00ab pressed. England was not so soon freed from the to make him sear the example of Henry VIII. to which the nuncio replied : \" Truly, sire, you will be the first sufferer; a hew religion given to a nation requires afterwards only the change ofthe prince.\" Francis might have replied, that neither Henry VIII. nor Gustavus Vasa, nor any of the SaxoH princes, were dethroned, after having embraced the reform. T"], [144, "114 disturbance of its prefbyterians and independents, Zi will be seen in the article relating to that power, in the detail to which we are about to proceed. It may be added, that all the Protestant princes and states benefited more or less by the labour and industry of a multitude of the proscribed, who emigrated from the Catholic countries, where they were persecuted, as happened particularly to the Protestants of France, at the revocation ofthe edict of Nantes; while the Catholics, tranquil and tolerated, under the dominion of the Protest ants, never thought of quitting and impove risoing their native land. We may also observe, that in the Protestant countries, agriculture and industry were enriched by the suppression of numerous holidays, lost to labour in Catholic countries, and which are, in reality, negative quantities, that diminish, by all their amount, the aggregate of national industry and riches. Germany. Before the reformation, the German empire was an irregular aggregate of states, which chance, convenience, or events had united into an ill formed confederation, the constitution of which was a true chaos. The individual forces of these different states, without direction, without unity, were almost a nullity as confederate forces, and incapable of acting externally. The Golden Bull \\ a strange production of the fourteenth century, fixed, it is true, some of the relations of the head"], [145, "115 with 'the members: but nothing was less cleat than the public right of all these independent, though united states. The personal character and power of the emperor were generally the only motives which decided the degree of respect paid to him by the other princes. During the long reign of the indolent Frederick 111. called the Pacific, who slept on the imperial throne from 1440 to 1492, this throne lost nearly all its conse- quence. Maximilian I. notwithstanding all the efforts he employed, had much difficulty in re- storing it. Among the most powerful of the elec- tors and other princes, there was not a single one sufficiently so to make himself respected exter- nally. They all lived at home, more like pri- vate gentlemen and fathers of families than like sovereigns, and were scarcely any thing more than the richest proprietors in their provinces. There was no likelihood that any ofthe reigning fami- lies would raise themselves from this general le- thargy above the rest. Each prince divided his states among his children, who were often very numerous, which, instead of strengthening, wea- kened the dynasties. None ofthe lands were in- divisible but those particularly attached to the electoral dignity. From these divisions, and from other causes, wars between prince and prince, troubles and disorders, frequently arose, which were not put an end to without much difficulty. The younger branches, who were worst provided for, and the lords, frequently gave 1 2"], [146, "116 themselves up to depredations, which at present would meet with extreme punishment, but ta which, in those times, a kind of chivalrous honour was attached. Nothing can be weaker than a body thus constituted. They met in diet, it is true, to deliberate on their common concerns ; but Frederick, during more than half a century, which he reigned, had never appeared there, and Maximilian, his son, seldom came, except to ask fur money, of which he was always in want, for the execution of his numerous projects. If, during the first years of Frederick's reign, the Turk, at that time the irreconcilable enemy of all Chris tianity, had not planted the crescent in Europe, and incessantly menaced the empire with inva sion, it is not easy to judge how the feeble bond which united this body could have remained un broken. The terror inspired by Mahomet IL and his ferocious troops, was the first common interest which obliged the princes of Germany to form a more solid connection with each other, round the imperial throne. It was in these circumstances that Charles, al ready in the possession of the flourishing kingdom of Spain, of part of Italy, of the states of the houses of Burgundy and Austria, acceded to this throne. The boundless power of this new empe ror soon occasioned an inquietude in most ofthe states for their future existence, which was me naced by the ambition of their young chief. The reformation offered them a rallying point, new i"], [147, "117 powers, and the possibility of forming a respectable opposition; they embraced it, as much from po litical motives as from religious persuasion. Charles V. did not embrace it, and, on his part, saw only in it the fortunate event, which, fur nishing him with the pretext and the right to combat the new opposition with all his power, offered the most desirable opportunity of accom plishing his designs without difficulty, and in a plausible manner. This is the main idea which forms the ground-work of the whole history of his reign. The Protestant princes and states en tered into a solemn league, in a sort of peculiar diet, held at Smalcald, under the two most consi derable princes of the league : Frederick tbe Wife, Elector of Saxony, the protector of Luther, and his first disciple among the sovereigns ; and Phi lip, Landgrave of Hesse, called the Generous. This league remained long in a menacing and in dependent attitude, in the presence of Charles. The continual attacks, as well ofthe French, the Venetians, the Milanese, and the popes, as of the Turks under Soliman II. and which gave the em peror sufficient employment in the south and east, prevented the rupture from taking place sooner. During this interval, the Protestants demanded concessions from the emperor, and Charles, who required their assistance, was compelled to yield to most of them. At length the moment arrived (in 1546, the very year of Luther's death, who had Constantly"], [148, "118 t endeavoured to prevent every sanguinary catas trophe) in which, being freed from his other enemies, Charles V. was enabled to engage in a contest with the party of the Protestants. At first he was successful ; the strength and the mi litary talents of the princes of the league were unequal to their courage ; and the brilliant vic tory of Muhlberg, in the second year of the war, in which the principal of them were made pri soners, seemed to have put an end to it. But scarcely had Charles began to enjoy his triumph when Maurice of Saxony snatched from him, by a blow as impossible to foresee as to guard against, the laurels he had so lately acquired, and nearly all those he had gained in his laborious career. The Saxon prince had very nearly made prisoner of the emperor himself, in Inspruck. The latter, by the peace signed at Passau, in 1552, strength erred more than ever the existence of the evan gelical body, and saw the sine projects he had conceived for bringing Germany under his domi nion, annihilated. The King of France, Henry H. who had assisted the Protestants in this war, publicly took the title of Protestor of the Germanic liberty, and Avenger of the captive princes. Assisted by these civil troubles in the empire, he also made himself master ofthe bishoprics of Metz, Toul.and Verdun. Charles V. did not lose an instant in hastening to retake these cities. He miscarried before Metz, and this was one of his last reverses. Germany now ceased to be what it had been"], [149, "119 oefore this crisis. Its ancient indolence was changed into an active vigilance. The princes of the league had tried their strength, and acquired confidence in themselves. The general confedera tion, which continued to subsist, was composed of two opposite parties, jealous of each other, both possessed of a constitutional existence, mu tually watching each other, and continually ap pearing ready to come to blows. This marked opposition, this reciprocal irritability became a new principle of life to the whole body, and de veloped all its powers. Notwithstanding the peace, (too sudden to be well secured J the empire resembled the ocean after a tempest, the waves of which are still terrible. The universal agitation made anew rupture apparent, and it would certain ly be an inexplicable phenomenon in history that this was retarded until 161S, if the personal cha racters of the three emperors who succeeded Char les V. did not assist us in penetrating the causes of it. At length, Ferdinand II. on ascending the im perial throne, found that devastating war already commenced, which continued during all his reign and great part of that of his successor. Austria took advantage of its open rupture with the Protest ant party, its frequent successes, and the presence of its armies, to annihilate in the Archduchy, Silesia and Moravia, not only the privileges pre viously granted to numerous Protestants, who had ofrener than once given uneasiness to"], [150, "120 their suspicious sovereigns, but also those privileges of the states which ameliorated then constitutions. She did the fame in Bohemia and Hungary, where sl.e not only destroyed all reli gious liberty, but also took possession of the in heritance to the crown, which had been formerly elective. The Austrian monarchs are indebted to the reformation for the definitive establishment of their real power within their states : the hope which they lost of ruling other states was cer tainly not so valuable to them as the real advan tage of being absolute and uncontrolled masters of their own, and of acquiring, as patrimonial inheritances, two kingdoms, so inexhaustible in resources and natural riches. The fate of Bohe mia was decided in 1620, after the bloody battle of Prague. That of Hungary, it is true, was not definitively settled until nearly sixty years later, but it was not the less an immediate conse quence of the religious war, and of the oppression of the Protestant party in this country. After the treaty of Westphalia, the Austrian power re tained no other internal weakening principle ex cept the division of its possessions in Suabia, Belgium, and Italy, which by that means became too difficult to defend, as was very evident in her subsequent wars. The last which she had with France deprived her of these fine but bur thensome domains. She has acquired others in Germany and Poland, which are much more agreeable to her real interests. Austria cannot"], [151, "121 longer conceive projects inimical to the liberty of Europe, because rivals, of too great weight, have sprung up around her, and confine her on all sides: but she may always hold an honourable rank among the principal powers, if see makes, a wise use of the lessons of external degradation, and internal consolidation, taught her by the reformation. During this long and cruel civil discord in the nations of Germany, the ancient bond which subsisted among them was never broken. Some of them were defi.rous that the whole should be Ca tholic : the others would remain Protestants; but nearly all of them wistied to remain united with each other and with their head. Had the empire heen divided into two -empires, these two weak confederations would have fallen a prey to the strongest, or to some stranger. On the contrary, experience has shown that the existence of an evangelical body, and its definitive organization, has become a salutary institution to the empire in general, and a strong security for its constitu tion ; and, that both parties have an equal interest in guarding and supporting it. Even at the pre sent day, when so many of its menbers have changed their form and their name, the life which supports the whole body will, in all probability, become the more active for it. Whatever may happen hereafter, all was disorder and disorgani sation in this extensive country before the refor-"], [152, "122 mation ; since that, and through its influence, every state has become order and organization. Protestant Germany subsisted at first by its fe derative force, with considerable equality between its principal members: and. as these states, with the exception of one, have not since been raised so as to produce any sensible influence on the political situation of the states of Europe, they may be passed over here in silence. That a succession of religious troubles has placed the house of Brunswick on the throne of Great Britain, is a circumstance of considerable interest in different points of view; but on the whole it rather con cerns an individual house, than a state. The King of England being a member of the em pire, has sometimes found greater facility in exciting the mass according to his interests ; he has been enabled to draw some regiments from Hanover. But, if what the defence of this country, and the attachment of the kings of the house of Brunswick for their German states, has cost England, be taken into the ac count; and if the sort of dependanceon Prussia and France which this royal crown, by its amalgama tion with the electorate, always must be in, and the state of humiliation to which it has sometimes been, consequently, reduced, be added to it, it will be acknowdged that the disadvantages are at least equal to the advantages. The true strength ef England k in its riches, a^nd its riches proceed"], [153, "123 from its fleets. Farther on we shall see what in fluence the reformation has had on the first deve lopment of this marine. A more important cir cumstance to the manner in which Germany is settled, was the establisoment of the Prussian mo narchy, the foundation of which was laid by the reformation. At the beginning of the sixteenth century, Prussia was an ecclesiastical country, go verned by the grand master of the Teutonic order. Albert of Brandenburgh, who was grand master at that time, soon followed the example which had been set him by more than one ecclesiastical prince. He secularized Prussia in 1525, and made it an hereditary duchy for himself and de scendants, under the seignorage of the Kings of Poland. He married and had children, and the last heiress of this branch, named Anne, espoused the hereditary prince, who was afterwards Elector of Brandenburgh, by the name of John Sigisinond. Prussia ceased to be a fief of Poland, in 1657, by the treaty of Wehlau, and definitively by that of Oliva, three years after. In 1701, it was erected into a kingdom, and has since raised itself to the rank of the first powers of Europe. It is very true that the future grandeur ofthe Prussian monarchs .could not be foreseen at the time of the seculariza tion ofthe duchy of Prussia ; it is, however, equal ly true that, without this event, we should at .pre sent find an Elector of Brandenburgh, but not a King of Prussia among the sovereigns of Europe."], [154, "124 This power, in its development, retained that kind of disposition which we have, before, attri buted generally to all the Protestant states ; a very marked public spirit, a fervent patriotism, great reciprocal attachment between the prince and his subjects, a spirit of liberty and of true republi canism, which extends from the throne to the peo ple. It may be added 'that a great part of the ancient possessions of the clergy is also united^to the domains of the crown, and another part is em ployed in establissiments useful to the country, we shall therefore find no difficulty in accounting for the internal strength manifested by Prussia in several trials, and which so effectually seconded the genius ofthe great Frederick/in the seven years war. It cannot be questioned that the circum stance of being a Protestant added something to the successes of this prince, while it also dimi nished the number of his enemies among his co estates in the empire. The number of those who secretly adhered to the reformation, in Silesia, Bohemia, and other Austrian countries, was great. When the tolerant banners of Prussia ap peared, all these sects would be more favourable to them than to the Catholic colours of intolerant Austria. Since, by a concurrence of many other causes, foreign to the object of this essay, Prussia has attain ed to the rank ofa power ofthe first order, its so vereigns have replaced the electors of Saxony in the important station of head of the Protestant party"], [155, "125 in Germany. They have attained a double influ ence in Europe, that of counterbalancing Austria in the empire, and that of contributing power fully, externally, to the support of an equilibrium in the general system of states, It may be also observed, that the treaties of Auglburgh and Munster, while they consolidat ed the body of the evangelical states in the em pire, left, nevertheless, a certain priority and pre ponderance to the Catholics, as well inthe electo ral college as in the remainder of the joint con cerns.* No Protestant prince has yet been deco rated with the imperial crown. Since^the religi ous interest has been, by degrees, replaced by a political interest, the evangelical body might be more aptly called the Prussian party, and the rest the Austrian party ; although more than one Ca tholic prince has found it convenient to join with Prussia, and some Protestant states have also been seen attached to Austria. It is probable that the imperial dignity will continue, for a considerable length of time, and perhaps to its extinction, to be enjoyed by the head of the latter house. The custom of some German princes of selling their troops to foreign powers, also originated in the time of the wars of the reformation, and of the long intervals of pea<~e which followed them. * Were it only by the clause which provides that if an eccle siastical prince changes his religion, so far from being enabled to secularize his states, he is declared to have forfeited them."], [156, "126 These troops, raised on a temporary occasion, dis ciplined, accustomed to live in camps, to plunder, to excesses, became, during peace, exceedingly burthensome to their master and to the country. They were very happy to dispose of them to who ever would pay them, and they even turned this traffic to advantage. Philip H. attacked Hol land with German soldiers, and it was with Ger mans that Holland defended itself. It is notori ous that this custom has been since continued to the great disgrace of humanity. Denmark. Since the' celebrated Margaret, called, before Catherine H. the Semiramis of the North, Denmark has been aggrandized by Norway ; and the states of Sweden had also placed the sceptre of their country in her hands. Her successors endeavour ed to make this election valid as an hereditary title; which occasioned vigorous wars between the Danish monarchs and the Swediso aristo cracy. The first lost the throne of Sweden by them, and benefited by not having further occa sion to waste their strength externally. The cler gy and principal nobility of their own states gave them sufficient employment at home. In 1527, they, with their people, adopted the reformation : but it was not completely consolidated, by the wise Christian III. until twelve years after. He was obliged to divide the spoils of the clergy"], [157, "127 with the great men of his kingdom, and to keep only the smallest share to himself. The income of the prelacies alone were adjudged to the crown, and these were also charged with the expenses of several establishments. Besides the regal dignity remained elective. It required the warlike reign of the enterprising Christian IV. it required more especially the ascendancy which the order of the citizens began to acquire, to reduce the nobility, and lead things to that state in which Frederick HI. found them in 1660, to enable him to render the kingdom hereditary and his authority uncon trolled. The only fundamental law which re mained express and untouched was that which established Lutheranism as the predominant reli gion ofthe state.* During the thirty years war the King of Denmark was, for an instant, the Aga memnon of the Protestant army ; this was the first attempt made by this government to the south ward, in the general affairs of Europe.

It was therefore in his power to make a better use of the reforma-. tion than his neighbour, Chrijlian, had'ddne. Iii 1527, he appropriated the greatest part of the pos sessions of the clergy to his own use, and only allowed small scares to the nobility. His wise and vigorous administration, directed these new riches to the maintenance of the royal authority, and he procured to himself a constitutional grant ofthe succession. This power, which is naturally weaker than any other of the great European powers, soon raised itself, however, by the genius of its kings and its ministers, as well as by the benefits of the refor mation, to a sort of supremacy in Europe. Its armies saved Protestantism, and, at almost every encounter, beat the imperial armies. She had the glory of presiding at Osnaburgh in the European congress of Westphalia, as France presided at that of Munster. A sum of money was given to her to withdraw her troops from Germany, where they became as burthensome to their friends as they had been to their enemies, and only a part of Pomerania, instead of the whole, which stie de manded, with some other small districts in the north of the empire, were ceded to her. By this cession the kings of Sweden have become mem bers of the Germanic body as the King of Den mark is for Holstein, and that of England for Hanover. Since that period exhausted Sweden"], [159, "129 <\\ has constantly declined. Twenty years after the peace of Westphalia, in 1668, notwithstanding the obligations of this country to France its ally, the interest of religion, or perhaps jealousy, induced it to unite with England and Holland, against that power, inthe warof Flanders and Franche Comte. Christina, whose only merit as a queen was that of having protected men of science, and, in parti cular, having honoured our great Descartes, con tributed very much to the decay of Sweden. Charles XII. completed its ruin. A gallant and weak queen, a despotic and conquering king, neu tralized the advantages which the reformation had procured to this country : if the successors of Gus tavus Adolphus, and Oxenstiern had always been worthy of them, the czars, in all probability, would not have built their imperial city on the Neva ; they would not have gained the banks of the Baltic; and the aspect of the north, and con sequently that of Europe, would, without doubt, have been different from what it is at present. But Sweden scone only for an instant; and, like one of those sudden meteors which just gave a transient splendor to its long nights, it soon dis appeared from the political horizon. Switzerland. Switzerland had its reformer in the person of Zwivgle, a monk, like Luther, and like him, irri tated by the opprobrium ofthe hawkers of indul gences, and who appeared almost at the fame 4K"], [160, "130 instant. Republicans, ardent friends to liberty, it was expected the Swiss would have outstripped all others in the reform : seven cantons, however, remained Catholic ; and, what is more remarkable, the cantons most decidedly republican were of this number. This phenomenon would not be easily explained without a knowledge of the localities. It has already been observed above,* that Catho licism is not, nor can it be every where the fame, modified as it is in different places by the pecu liar spirit and character of each. The Catholic ism ofthe small cantons of Schwitz, Uri, and Underwald, precisely because it was establisced among these mountaineers, republicans by nature, had taken the forms which suited their character, and was interwoven with their manners. Besides, the inhabitants of these mountains have a lively imagination, on which external objects produce a powerful influence, the indolence ofthe pastoral life makes religious spectacles and feasts necessary to them. A worscip accompanied by many forms and ceremonies would, therefore, please them, in preference to one which is too simple and too sedate. It was here that the founders of the Helvetic liberties resided : and the remem brance of all the events and all the great men of that period, was intimately blended with the Ca- \u25a0 i ' \u25a0 ' \u25a0 'V * In the First Part, at the commencement ofthe paragraph, Reformation. ,"], [161, "131 tholic worscip, and its ceremonies. It was not obelisks, it was chapels which, in this country, marked the renowned fields of battle, the acts of their ancestors. Who has travelled in Switzer- land, and not seen the chapel of William Tell? It was an idolatry, a national fanaticism, which excited this mixture of the worscip of liberty with that of religion, in these small cantons. Such is their Catholicism at the present day : they have no idea of any other. The abuses of the church were scarcely felt among them. The popes could not exact tribute from these poor mountaineers : and their priests, being the only men a little in- formed, in their hamlets and towns, had acquir- ed, and still retain to the present day, a great ascendancy over the deliberations of the assem- blies, and over all their affairs. It may be added that knowledge had made less progress among them, than among their rich neighbours in the plain ; and that having formerly given them, as it were, their liberty, they were not disposed to allow them to prescribe a change in their reli- gion. Other localities kept Lucerne, Fribourg, and Soleure in the Catholic faith. Sanguinary conflicts and a religious civil war, several times suspended, but prolonged., at intervals, until the eighteenth century, ensued between the members of this modern Achaia ; and a germ of division still remains undestroyed among them. Spain, the Pope, and Austria gave effectual sup port to the Catholic party. Fiance and England K 2"], [162, "132 alternately supported the Protestant cantons. Hence the sympathies and antipathies of the dif ferent members of the Helvetic confederation to one or other of these powers. The late events have also exhibited an example of the animosi ties ofthe small cantons against the French, the ancient protectors of the reformed cantons, and of the attachment of the Bernois to these fame French. Switzerland, employed and weakened by these civil discords, has, since the reformation, lost the little external influence which it had previously had in the affairs of Europe. But its Protestant cantons were in the number of those countries to which the revocation of the edict of Nantes procured the greatest advantages. The refugees flocked there in considerable numbers with their industry and their property. The high pitch to which the sciences and good manners had reached in these cantons, favoured by a long peace, and that species of inviolability which this respectable confederation so long en joyed, is well known. Geneva. While in this faint outline I have neglected to devote particular articles to considerable state* such as Bavaria, for example, it will doubtless appear astoriiscing that I pause at a simple town, a city ofa few thousand inhabitants. But this im perceptible point on the physical map of Europe"], [163, "133 is of very great importance on that of European morals. It was there that the two Frenchmen, Calvin and Theodore de Beze, rejected by their country, established a new and powerful focus of religious reform. The first fruit of it was the li berty of Geneva, which expelled its prince-biscop, and afterwards governed itself for almost three centuries. It found sufficient resources in the, energy of its inhabitants, and sufficient strength in the benefits ofthe reformation, to support long wars and to defend itself by force against the princes ofthe house of Savoy, its dangerous neigh bours, who had long endeavoured to reduce it under their dominion, and did not definitively ac knowledge its independence till towards the mid dle of the last century. \u2022 The influence ef this small democracy sprung from the reformation ; replete with knowledge, patriotism, and activity, its influence, I fay, on some of the great states, particularly on France, England, and Russia, is incalculable. Geneva was the cradle of the religion professed by Henry IV. and which the ambition of the, house of Guise, the subtlety of a Mediiis, the interest and the secret practices of Rome and Spain, prevented him from carrying with him to the throne of France. It was to Geneva that all the proscribed En giisc exiles, who were driven from their island by the intolerance of the first Mary, 'the wife of Philip IL came, to get intoxicated I ith republi-"], [164, "134 canism and independence. From this focus issued the sects of prescyterians and independents who so long agitated Great Britain and conducted the unfortunate Charles I. to the scaffold. In the works of Dr. Swift, there is a sermon which he delivered on the anniversary of the death of this martyr-king ( for so the Englisc have since jiamed him,) in which he explains, like a man of good information, the progress of this order of events. Finally, it is well known that a multitude of men of talents have issued from Geneva, who, as writers, as men in office, have, in the most decid ed manner, influenced the different states of Europe, their political and moral situations, their opinions and their knowledge. To mention Le Fort, the friend and counsellor of Peter I. is to bring to recollection all which one of its citizens has done for the civilization and prosperity of the most extensive empire in existence. Besides the great men which it has formed, Geneva, has, at all times, been visited by the numerous tra vellers of every country who have come to Italy and Switzerland. It has communicated more or less of its spirit to all those who were calcu lated to receive it: and from all these considera tions, it may be truly said, that this small repub lic has had as great a scare in the destiny, and in the morai} and political amelioration of Europe, as many gr4at monarchies."], [165, "135 This is an additional proof of the immense advantage of small states to humanity, and of the use, which, by means of them, is rmde of the central power of every district of the earth. These proofs are continually renewed in Germany, where we meet with free cities, and principalities, of a moderate extent, all of which have an active, peculiar, and independent existence. Every one is emulous that industry and the arts and sciences should flourisc in his small capital. Universities and schools are multiplied, and instruction con- sequently becomes more general through the na- tion. If truth is persecuted by fanaticism in any place, it is only necessary to make one step, and it finds a secure asylum on passing the nearest frontier. In a word, every small state of this con- federate system feels that it has some consequence in itself, and therefore really possesses that conse- quence. Each town of a moderate size is not paralyzed by the idea that it is nothing; that at a distance of one or two hundred leagues there is another larger city, which is every thing, a gulf in which all its labours are to be absorbed ; a city in which all the glory of the empire centres in a single point, out of which there is no prospe rity, out of which there is only a political, moral, and literary insulation, through the whole extent Of an immense territory. If Athens, ifDelphos, if Corinth, Pisa, Lace deman, Mytilene, Smyrna, had not enjoyed this peculiar individuality, and if one queen-city had"], [166, "136 attracted to itself all the glory of Greece, would so many great men and great virtues have blazed forth in every part of it ? If the arts, if the muses of Italy, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, had not perceived its courts and its flouriscing republics smiling on them every where and at hand ; if genius had not been aroused by immediate fame and encouragement at Ferrara, Mantua, Florence, Venice, Guastalla, and Sienna, as well as at Rome and Naples : if, in all Italy, there had been but one centre, one point, one city, would it have become the most classical country of the arts in modern times? Holland. Another creation, of more immediate impor tance to the politics of Europe, and which arose out of the reformation, was the republic of the United Provinces. This new state was a part of the possessions of the 'house of Austria, and was retained by the Spanisc branch, that is to fay, by Philip II. after the death of Charles V. Here the fame solid foundation of national spirit, liberty, and rectitude prevailed, as in Lower Saxony : ic had the fame manners, nearly the fame language, and the fame origin. Before their independence, the Low Countries made part of the empire, and of the circle of Burgundy. The reformation made rapid strides in it. Its mortal enemy, Phi lip II. endeavoured to stifle it in a country where it was cherisced, and opposed force to opinion^"], [167, "137 without discretion. But opinion is a secret file which wears away the iron that is rubbed against it. The inquisition, that was intended io preserve Holland to Spain and the Catholic faith, only hastened its revolt against both of them. After fifteen years of troubles, resistance, and sufferings, the exasperated Batavians declared themselves free from the yoke of Philip* The idea of forming an independent republic does not seem to have occurred to them at first : they only wisced to preserve their franchises and privileges. The confederate provinces offered the patronage of their country to several ofthe neighbouring princes, upon the condition of their ancient capitulations. The duke of Alencon, bro ther to Henry III. quitted this station from inca pacity and want of conduct: Queen Elizabeth refused it through a policy which penetrated beyond the apparent advantage of a day. At length, not knowing who to give themselves to, the Batavians resolved upon being their own mas ters. Each province formed itself into a repub- \u2022 Some ofthe wife counsellors of this prince wished him to employ milder and more salutary measures against the Bata vians : he misiht, perhaps, have adopted them but for the fppofite and violent advice of Pope Pius V. who also indu.ed him to intrust the expedition to the execrable and ferocious Duke ofAlva. It was Clement XZ^wlio, in canonizing situ V. applauded him for this great 7eal in support os the faith. !\u00a3\\*e bul] ofcauonia-uipn is dated 2^d Mily, 1/12."], [168, "138 iic, and entered into the terms of a confederation with the others. The body which resulted from this, was a complicated and uncouth form ; but the spirit was good, and its good effects prevailed notwithstanding the faulty machine in which it was inclosed. Men of talents, animated by this spirit, carried the republic to that height of great ness and prosperity to which it is known to have attained. Having to struggle against Spain, which at that time, was the first maritime power, and which brought its fleets to the attack, it was ne cessary that the new state scould also be maritime, to make head against its enemy, and to obtain re sources by commerce. The Dutch fleets soon ranked among the first in Europe; the genius of patriotism and liberty wrought the same miracles on the seas as on the soil of Belgium. Thus, it is to the reformation that Holland is, mediately, in debted for this source of its power and prospe rity. Let us return to what passed in its interior. Religious enthusiasm had been the principle of the revolution. Can it therefore be thought strange, if, in a new and free state, it scould con tinue to manifest itself, to exercise a powerful in fluence on the body ofthe state, and to give rise to a multitude of fanatic and formidable sects ? It was not here as in the states of Germany, for example, where the prince had become a Protest ant, as well as his subjects3 and was enabled to maintain very nearly the old government with the new religion. Here, every one thought all"], [169, "139 t was free, and the theologians acted very impor tant parts. It was from this cause that the bi gotry of Protestantism was carried to a greater ex cess in Holland than in any other country, and, that religious controversies always led to political convulsions, and revolutions in its government. The history of this republic offers many such ex amples. It is known how much the Prince Stadtholders, in order to extend their own autho rity and lower that of the states, made use of the dissensions between the sect of Arminians and that of the Gomarists. The animosity of Maurice of Orange was carried to such a pitch that he took advantage of his triumph to bring Barneveld, an -old patriot, who had rendered the most signal ser vices to his country, and who supported the party of the states, to the block. These troubles form the ground-work of the internal history of the republic, from the time it has had a settled exist ence. They originated in the religious opinions ; though, it is true, they were afterwards kept alive both by the defects of the constitution itself, and by external causes, the development of which does not belong to our subject. England. Among the passions of Henry VIII. King of England, must be reckoned that which he had for St. Thomas Aquinas. His veneration for this vigorous champion of the Roman orthodoxy was carried so far, that Luther having contradicted"], [170, "140 St. Thomas with acumen, Henry thought himself bound to enter the lists and defend his master. He therefore wrote a Treatise, or Assertion of the seven Sacraments, against Luther, who admitted of no more than two. The latter treated his new adversary as his equal, and ridiculed him. The king-doctor conceived a violent hatred against him. The Pope, who perhaps laughed as much at the book as Luther did, gave its author all the conso- lation he was able, and conferred on him the title of Defender of the Faith. Six years had not elapsed when Henry, unfaithful to the Pope, separated with his kingdom from the Holy See, preserving however, his title of Defender of tbe Faith, which his successors still retain. This first step was the foundation of a series of revolutions and evils, which have scarcely ceased, at this time, to distract the three kingdoms; for the late revolts in Ireland were also a consequence of it. The reformation has not produced such extravagant and contradictory effects in any Other country. The insulated situation of Great Britain, as well as the saturnine and invincible character of its inhabitants, contributed to them. The neigh bouring nations were unable to give effective assist ance to either party, and the internal activity could not act externally. When a conflagration takes place in a building so inaccessible, it must burn within it, and the flame only ceases when it cannot sind aliment. Other causes have also contributed"], [171, "141 to these vigorous and long discords in the Eng lish church, and it is necessary to point them out. In the first place, Henry did not intend to be come a Protestant ; he only wanted to espouse the beautiful Anne Boleyn. But to accomplisc this the Pope's consent to the divorce of Hen ry from his first wife, sister to the Emperor Charles V. was necessary. The Pope, who, in other circumstances, would doubtless have been more complaisant, decided in favour of him, who, ofthe two princes, appeared the most formidable, and refused his consent to the divorce. Henry, enraged that the Pope scould dare to thwart his love, declared himself head of the church of England, and prohibited all intercourse with Rome : he was excommunicated, by way of reprisal. But he hated Luther at least as much as the Pope ; and, during his reign, it was as dan gerous to pass for a Protestant as for a Catholic. He gave an episcopal constitution to the Church, in which, with little more exception than the monks, whose possessions he seized, the ancient edifice of the hierarchy remained almost entire, and, in which he, very closely and very despoti cally acted the part ofthe sovereign Pontiff. This was doing either too much or too little. The universal crisis did not admit of half measures. The German reform had found many partisans in England, and a considerable number of minds \u00a3"], [172, "142 were devoted to it. The greater part os them were discontented to find their attempt frus trated, and made very little difference between the Catholics and the episcopalians. The signal of rebellion against Rome was given : it was easy to foresee that it would not willingly stop half way. This was the first cause of the troubles. The determined Protestants, as well as the Catholics, became sworn enemies to the episcopalians, and to the government which supported them. Second cause. Far from a constant persever ance in this half-reformation of Henry VIII. no thing was seen in the succeeding reigns but re tractions and sudden and violent transitions from Protestantism to papism, and from papism to episcopacy. After Edward VI. whose reign was too scort, had made a step towards the reforma tion, followed the reign of the Catholic and bi gotted Mary, daughter of the princess who had been repudiated by Henry, brought up in Spain, under the eye of her mother, in hatred to Protest antism and episcopacy. She had scarcely ascended the throne when sce married her relation, the san guinary Philip, afterwards King of Spain. All that had been done by Henry VIII. and Edward VI. was overturned ; the Protestants and epis copalians were displaced, expelled, persecuted, and inhumanly massacred. Four biscops, among whom was the virtuous patriot Cranmer, arch biscop of Canterbury, were burnt alive. Every place w7as filled with the most intolerant Catholics. 6"], [173, "143 The animosity of the different parties was carried to its utmost pitch. A reign of five years, from ISS3 to 1558 was sufficient for Mary and her popisc theologians to disperse the venom of civil W'ars, and the most inplacable hatreds, over un happy England. The Protestants, persecuted by her, fled in multitudes to Germany, Switzerland, and more particularly to Geneva, from whence they afterwards carried back the republican ideas of the anabaptists and calvinists which, combined with the acrimony of exile, rendered the ex plosion so fatal to their country. If Henry VIII. had prudently adopted Luther's reform, and his successors had persisted in it, the island would probably have remained as tranquil as Sweden and Denmark did in the end. Eliza- beth succeededM^ry, and re-establisced the reform, retaining the episcopacy. The new ecclesiastical system was publisced in London, by a national council, in 1 563, and called the AEl of Uniformity. It was intended to bring all parties to an union by its means : but the time had passed ; the minds of men had become too ulcerated, their heads too eccentric. The separation of non-con- formists, puritans, and prescyterians, from the episcopal church, became more obvious and more injurious. To complete the confusion, the Irish had remained Catholics. It was here that Philip of Spain, enraged against Elizabeth, who had refused him her hand, and supported his re bellious subjects in the Low Countries, employed"], [174, "144 his intrigues, scattered gold, and endeavoured to stir up a revolt: he was seconded by Rome, France, and Mary, Queen of Scotland, who afterwards perisced by the axe of the executioner, in the hands of her rival. The long war, replete with animosity, which from that time raged furiously between England and Spain, rendered the first of these powers am- bitious of raviscing all its advantages from her adversary, and of rivalling it in all points. The Englisc marine takes date from this period of ini- mical emulation. Subsequent to the discovery of America, Spain rode triumphant on the seas, which slie covered with her vessels. Elizabeth constructed fleets, formed sailors, and endeavoured to make head against Philip on this element. The latter, who believed himself to be King of Eng- land, because the pope had conferred its crown upon him, and Elizabeth, being excommunicated and a heretic, could no longer possess it, prepared a fleet, which still retains the nick-name of invin- cible, but which was destroyed by the Englisc and the winds, for the conquest of his kingdom. Thus, with an action of such splendor, began the marine of England ; and it is with reason that its foundation, as well as that of the Dutch marine, is attributed to the events produced by the reforma tion, while the spoils of the clergy assisted both governments in this expensive undertaking. To the immortal Elizabeth succeeded fames L King of Scotland, an enemy to the prescyterians,"], [175, "145 who predominated in that kingdom, and revolted against him, for having attempted to put them on the footing of the episcopal church. His reign is a tissue of erroneous measures, which displeased all parties. He married his son to a Catholic princess of the house of France, after having offended the nation by a project of marriage between the fame son and a Spanisc princess. His faults prepared all the misfortunes ofthe reign of Charles I. When the latter came to the throne, every disposcabie part of the possessions of the clergy had been lavisced in the preceding reigns, either on favourites or enemies of the throne, whose minds it had been employed in seducing and retaining ; or applied to the expenses of the new marine, or the wars with Spain. The unfortunate Charles found himself without resources, and con strained incessantly to demand imposts from a lower house, which, having become almost wholly prescyterian, insolently refused them, or scackled him with intolerable conditions, to obtain them. Hence his necessity for having recourse to every illeo-al method of establiscing new levies. Fa vourable to the Catholics, like his father, and, consequently, a greater friend to the episcopalians than to the prescyterians, he endeavoured to com plete the work of James, by establiscing episco pacy in Scotland. By this step, he drove the in habitants of that kingdom into open rebellion, and he made war upon his subjects of Scotland with an army of Englisc, who were very nearly as little .4."], [176, "146 attached to him; leaving behind him, in London, a parliament as greatly to be dreaded by him as the Scotch convention. From this religious and political fermentation, arose a powerful sect of in- dependents, who made themselves masters of the commons, expelled the lords from the upper house, and began by compelling the unfortunate Charles, already at his last resource, to give up his faithful minister Strafford, to the executioner. The new parliament declared itself exempt from the royal prorogation ; deposed and persecuted the episcopalians, disposed of the places, civil, mili- tary, and ecclesiastical, to the most violent, to men without conduct, without scame, and, fre- quently, of the lowest class of the people ; they secretly excited the rebels of Ireland, and, at the fame time, refused the king every means of redu- cing them ; and when, at length, exhausting his last resources, Charles assembled an army to give them battle, the independents had the address to bring this army over to oppose the unfortunate king. Abandoned by it, he threw himself into the hands ofthe Scotch, who delivered him up to the Englisc. The weak party ofthe royalists took up arms in vain. Cromwell subdued them, and reigned more despotically than any monarch would have dared to do; and, as the parliament, already mutilated by him, did not conduct itself to his liking, he dissolved, and dismissed them. The crowned head fell upon the scaf fold. The implacable and inveterate hatred which"], [177, "147 had been restrained by the soldiers ofthe Protect or, while he lived, broke out during the anarchy which succeeded his reign. The most discordant political opinions were united with the most extra- vagant religious opinions. Massacres, executions, and civil war, desolated the face of three king doms. From having abused every religious prin ciple, and carried them to excess, they all fell indis criminately into discredit: atheism, libertinism, and a contempt for every law, divine or human, succeeded them. In this state of things Charles II. ascended the throne ; favoured Catholicism again in secret, and episcopacy openly ; married a Ca tholic princess, who drew a multitude of foreigners of this sect into the kingdom ; and made war upon Protestant Holland, the ancient ally of England. At each of these changes, so sudden and so nu- merous, and which were the principal source of all the misfortunes of England, those who adhered to the oppressed party, took refuge in vast num- bers beyond the seas : the Protestants, as has been said, in Germany, Holland, Switzerland, and America; the Catholics, in France and Italy, where their fanaticism acquired new strength, and whither they were followed by the episcopalians, who, in that situation, generally became Catho- lics. In fact, it was there that fames II. who succeeded Charles II. became so. His impolitic attempts to establisc popery in England only served to carry the animosity and confusion to its height: he lost his crown, and died in exile. His J. 2"], [178, "148 daughter Mary, a true Protestant, and his son-in law.; William of Orange, were called by the nation to fill the throne. ; Their wisdom began to still this long tempest. It was a long time before the roaring of the waves ceased ; but a solemn act of succession having excluded the Catholic princes, the Protestant house of Hanover came to the throne .of England ; and by a mild and uniform govern ment, has gradually calmed the agitation of the ancient parties. Now when this terrible crisis' is appeased, what remains to the nation from it? The energy arising from long civil commotions ; the melan choly produced by the recollection of them; the profound love of liberty, for which so much blood has been sced; the tendency to meditation left by religious exaltation ; and the toleration of all opi- nions, which is the natural successor of the intox ication of fanaticism. One great error in the Englisc monarchs, was the belief that the episcopal system was a support to the throne : a feeble prop, which so easily car- ried with it, in its fall, the throne which depended upon it, and of which it could not in any case retard the ruin. In the dark period which pre ceded Luther, the support of the clergy was of importance to princes ; but since his appearance, the church, protected in its external government by the civil power, scould limit its activity to the simple encouragement of good morals in the state, through the influence of religion."], [179, "149 The reformation, which has been a benesit to other countries, was the most grievous of scourges to unfortunate Ireland. Treated as a conquered people, and for a long time at the discretion of the Englisc, the Irisc remained obstinately Catho lic, precisely because their oppressors wanted them to be Protestant. Their chains became conse quently heavier ; their island was filled with rapa cious Englisc, who possessed themselves of almost all the estates. The despair of these irritated men, at length broke out with fury in 1641. The consequence was a massacre through the island, of upwards of one hundred thousand Protestants. Cromwell afterwards took vengeance on them, and gave nearly the whole of Ireland to his sol diers. William III. founded a legal and consti tutional tyranny there. The Catholics were de prived of civil life, of property, of instruction itself: it was his pleasure to convert them into hordes of rude, barbarous beggars ; and they have revenged themselves like barbarians whenever an opportunity has offered. Such resentments last, and are transmitted to remote generations. Du- ring the last war, the Irisc gave many strong proofs that several reigns of tolerance had not been able effectually to eradicate their strong ani- mosity against the Englisc."], [180, "150 United Slates of America. It is sufficient to name this new state, which is wholly European upon the soil of America, to bring to mind that it was created by the parti sans of reform and of liberty, flying from the op pression and intolerance of parties. If the En glisc emigrants who had sought scelter on the continent of Europe, during the course of the troubles which have been spoken os, brought back with them the seeds of discord and of hatred, those who took refuge in the solitudes of Penn sylvania, acquired peace and toleration there. They founded Philadelphia, the city of brothers : certainly the most pleasing name that ever was borne by the residence osman. Escaped from the tempests to this distant coast, restored to nature and the primitive destination of the human race, these colonists, who had taken their knowledge with them, had leisure to. reflect on the origin and rights of societies; on the respective duties of governments and nations. Having besides an entirely new political body to organize, the ele ments of legislation must necessarily engage their attention first. We have consequently received from thence some admirable precepts, and still more admirable examples. It is known that after having returned under the dominion of the mother country, this association of free and ener getic men, of almost all countries, afterwards determined to resume the right of governing"], [181, "151 themselves.. Louis XVI. seconded them in this enterprize, and sent an army thither. The French who composed it came as friends among these republicans, were admitted into their confidence, and, for the first time, saw this spectacle, to them so surprising, of simplicity of manners, of evan- gelical peace, among men who supported their rights. Reflection arose within them; they com- pared the principles and the government of their own country, with what they observed among the descendants of Penn, and it is notorious how emi- nently these Frenchmen, Who were thus made the soldiers of liberty by a monarch, scowed them selves to be so in effect, during the first years of the revolution. .Imong the great number of proximate and remote causes which contributed to it, the American republic, and the reforma tion from which it \"sprang, must not be' for gotten. This state, still weak, at a distance from Europe, has not hitherto had much direct influence, on the political system. But who can calculate that which it may one day acquire on the colonial and com- mercial system so important to Europe? Who can foretell all that may resclt in the two worlds, from the seductive example of the independence conquered by the Americans? what new posi- tion would the world assume, if this example was followed? and without doubt it will be in the end. Thus two Saxon monks will have changed the face of the globe. The Dominican Tetzel, came"], [182, "152 impudently to preach indulgences at the gates of Wittemberg: the open and vehement Luther was indignant at it: he raised his voice against the indulgences, and all Europe was affected, put into a ferment, and inflamed. A new order of things was the result; powerful republics were founded. Their principles, still more power ful than their arms, were introduced into all nations. Hence arose great revolutions, and those which may yet arise are, doubtless, incalculable. II. STATES, THE GOVERNMENTS OF WHICH DID NOT EMBRACE THE REFORM. Spain. This country, governed by one ofthe branches of the house of Austria, had a principal scare in the party opposed to the reformation. The mortal wars which its kings carried on first, against Hol land, then against England, and afterwards against both at the fame time, was pernicious to it. Be sides exhausting it of men and money, these two rival powers, being obliged to provide themselves with arms, similar to those made use of by Spain, raised a marine, which soon crusced hers. From that time a considerable portion of the sources of its prosperity were dried up. A rivalry once 6"], [183, "153 establisced in this manner between Spain and England, necessarily obliged Portugal, in the end, to throw itself into the arms of the latter power: the right of patronage thus acquired by England still exists, and procures it great commercial advantages. The terrible struggle, which Spain supported externally, could not however, be continued without exactions and rigorous proceedings at home. The people, wearied and indignant, pre pared to repel oppression. However ignorant the Spaniards might have been, the double example ofthe Bohemians, who had conquered their re ligious liberty, and ofthe Dutch, who had con quered their political liberty, from the despotic house of Austria, was so well known to them, and so seducing, as to induce them to follow it. Hence arose the revolts of Andalusia, of Catalonia, of Portugal, and of the Italian states. Portugal was strong enough under its new kings to main tain its independence. But what was the conse quence to the other revolted provinces, to Cata- Ionia in particular, which cost a war of nineteen years to reduce it ? They lost all their rights and privileges by it, and were treated as conquered countries. The authority ofthe kings of Spain was in reality increased and strengthened at the termination of this crisis : the numerous armies which returned into the interior, at the peace, served to complete the subjugation ofthe nation."], [184, "154 It must, however, be observed, that these internal revolts, and the war of Caralonia, compelled Spain to agree to very hard conditions as the price \u00a9f peace. She became sooner disposed to acknow ledge the Republic ofthe United Provinces, and was obliged to yield Rousillon, Perpignan, Con flans, and a considerable part of the Low Countries to France, and the important island of Jamaica to England. In other respects, the religious reformation had little or no effect on Spain. Its geographical position, and, still more, its language being diffe- rent from the other nations of Europe, were ob- stacles to it. At that period the inquisition, in- troduced into the kingdom by Ferdinand, was more strictly on its guard than ever ; and there is no doubt but many ofthe cruelties then exercised by it, resulted from the terror inspired by the noise of the storm which grumbled at a distance. Nevertheless the general influence of the refor- mation and the progress of knowledge on the spirit of humanity, has already terminated in the extinction of the inquisition itself. Now, when perhaps there are more heretics and unbelievers in Spain than at any former period, there are also fewer religious executions. Great reforms seem to be in preparation there ; and the kings of French origin who are placed on the throne, act differently towards the church than Philip II. did,"], [185, "155 France. While the reform spoke German, it made but few proselytes in France : when the French- Swiss of the canton of Berne, when Calvin, lent it their organs to enable it to explain itself in French, it penetrated into every part of the king dom, and made itself known, particularly under the new form it had taken at Geneva. The na tion was too enlightened, too vivacious for the new ideas to be retarded in their progress. From the steps of the throne to the most remote cot tages, the doctrines of the reformers found nume rous partisans, and the Roman communion would doubtless have been overturned in France, if the monarch had consented to it. All the weak minds, who compose the multitude, and the great majority of the people, would have been drawn into it. The Catholics who chose to con tinue so, would have retained the free exercise of their worscip ; the country would not have been torn by a long civil war ; an edict of Nantes would not have been revoked ; the immense force which, at that time, might have been freely displayed by France, would, without difficulty, and at its plea sure, have stopped the commotions of Germany and England ; France would have remained tran quil within ; and, without, would have been the arbiter of Europe. Francis I. remained a Catholic : something has been said ofthe reasons which determined him to."], [186, "156 act thus.* From that time he pretended to scow his consequence, and to eradicate the roots of the heresy. He therefore, without pity, burned and massacred those of his subjects who openly em braced the reform. Externally, he supported it, and formed an alliance with the princes of Ger many. This double and inconsistent conduct of the French government deprived it of the best part of its strength, and obstructed its operations. Within, it was requisite to guard against the re formed ; these refused their assistance, or served with regret, and preferred deserting, emigrating, and combating with their brethren of Germany, Switzerland, or Holland, to remaining exposed to puniscment, while fighting on the side of their persecutors. Hence, it became impossible for France to acquire all the preponderance which would have been her portion in another state of things. It has become a trite axiom, that the blood of martyrs extends a rising sect. Hinry II. scowed himself still more intolerant than his father, and the reformed entered into a closer con nection with each other for their mutual support, and to prevent their total ruin. Thus they began to raise a formidable opposition in the kingdom, * At the end of that article of this section, intituled, First Point of View. Internal situation of States."], [187, "157 which raged during the sanguinary course of the three succeeding reigns. The throne ceased to be the tribunal ofjustice and of peace to the people ; the king to be a father to his subjects. France mangled its own bosom, and the aggression which was the child of authority, compelled the unfor tunate objects of its oppression to become rebels. The horrible scenes of Saint Bartholomew will for ever be an afflicting and irrevocable proof of the perfidy and implacable hatred which actuated the court in its conduct towards the Protestants. Thus the latter acquired the form of a political party: princes, nobles were at their head ; they had ar mies, allies, posts in the kingdom. The history of the intestine wars which, on this occasion, de- solated France from 1562 to 1598, when the edict of Nantes put an end to them, is too well known for it to be necessary to give even a sketch of them here. But animosities and commotions, of such vio lence, do not take place without leaving deep traces in the constitution of the government, as well as in the character of the nation : hence they determine, fora length of time, the mode of exist ence of the latter, and its political situation. Let us endeavour to scow the principal result ofthe religious troubles in France, at the end of the six teenth century, both with respect to the govern ment, and to the political character of the nation. The most fortunate event that can happen to a"], [188, "158 monarch whose authority in his states is limited by the power of his nobles, or of any civil corpo ration whatever, is that which produces a marked opposition, an open rebellion, which he may combat and reduce by force of arms. At this moment of general dread and submission, every thing is allowed to him; no one dares to urge rights or privileges, and the prince has an open sield to render his power more absolute in fu ture. History furnisces frequent examples of similar issues to revolts and commotions in states. Without doubt this is not always the case, and the prince, if, on the contrary, he is obliged to com pound, loses a part of his authority, or is wholly deprived of it. We have seen the house of Austria in these two different situations, at the fame time, in the thirty years war ; having the worst with the German princes whom it hoped to reduce to vassalage, and the upper hand in its states, parti cularly those of Hungary and Bohemia, where it establisced an unlimited and hereditary mo narchy. But that which succeeded so badly with the emperors in respect of the German protestant princes, had the most happy issue with the kings of France against the reformed party. The result of it was a great consolidation and extension ofthe regal power. At the moment when it became un limited, and when the strength of government was the most energetic, if France had had a Louis XI. or a Philip //.of Spain, on the throne, with what despotism might not our annals have been stained? 2"], [189, "159 But at that period Providence placed a Henry IV. on it, who, having so many outrages to avenge, so many crimes to punisc, thought only of burying all animosity in oblivion, of healing all wounds. Then, which is very rare inthe government of na tions, absolute power was employed only in promo ting the prosperity of the state, and the felicity- of every individual. The Catholic religion remained dominant; but the edict of Nantes effaced intole rance, and soothed the irritation of the conquered party, to whom liberty of conscience, and a poli tical existence were secured. These wise dispositions were satisfactory to good sense and equity : they were not enough for fanatacifm : it made several attempts on the life of the saviour of France, and, at lensth succeeded in assassinating him. From this day of mourning (May 14th, 1 610,) the Protestant party, alarmed, with justice, at the intrigues of the new court, and at the offensive steps taken against it, re volted again, took up arms, and prepared for the defence of its rights. The impartiality of history cannot blame this conduct ; but neither can it blame that of Richelieu, in not suffering an armed faction, which formed a state within a state, which called in foreigners, frequently thwarted the best projects ofthe administration, and inces santly threatened the existence of the government. In the existing situation of things, he was obliged to oppose them : his success is known-, as well as the new increase which the royal autho-"], [190, "160 rity obtained from his victories. The legal des potism of the three subsequent reigns, which ter minated in the terrible catastrophe of the last re volution, may be attributed to the definitive re duction of the religious opposition under Louis XIII. But though the government succeeded in ren dering its authority absolute, the nation, never theless, retained a ferment, a principle of irrita tion, resistance, and contradiction, which was manifested here and there against the arrangements which emanated from the throne. From the edict of Nantes to the period which preceded its revo cation, when the open violation of it began to be manifested, the parliaments had been partly composed of Huguenots. During this period, it was natural that these bodies scould scow them selves refractory, and be animated with a certain spirit of republicanism and opposition to the court. When the Huguenots were expelled, this spirit did not go with them: the parliaments were proud of their influence, and of the essay which they had sometimes made of their strength. This was not the only cause of the ulterior con duct ofthe parliaments; but it contributed greatly to it. It was therefore in them that the spirit of independence remaining in the nation took refuge, and there it was found in 1788, when the exhausted finances, an effeminate court, the principles of republican liberty propagated by some writers from the books ofthe Englisc and"], [191, "161 other Protestants, or brought from Pennsylvania by the French army: in scort, when a thousand circumstances gave it the impulse it then took, and which was so rapidly communicated to the whole nation. It is known what influence was produced on the general revolt by the old f escntments of the huguenot party, which were far from being extinguisced, and which had often been too wantonly envenomed before the reign of Louis XVI. In fact, Richelieu only wisced to subdue the dissidents, not to annihilate them. The peace of Rochelle, in 1629, had left them some privileges, with the free exercise of their religion. From a contempt of the royal word, all these promises were soon violated. Secret and open persecutions increased from day to day, until the formal revo cation of the edict of Nantes gave them free vent ; a deplorable epocha, which reduced a multitude of families to beggary, gave rise to the emigration ofthe best and the most industrious citizens, whose descendants are still to be met with in every Pro testant state in Europe, where they have carried prosperity to the prejudice of their own unjust country. Such of these unfortunate people as re mained in France, lost all civil existence, were pursued without remission, without pity, and like wild beasts ; their blood frequently streamed under the steel of the executioner, or of the soldiery. Such treatment made a deep impression on men's hearts, and indignation was propagated from- father .M"], [192, "162 to son.* This last explosion of popisc intolerance at length ceased. The unfortunate Louis XVI, who had not been rendered inhuman by a great scare of Catholicism, laboured to heal all these wounds, f when the storm arose, of which he was the most illustrious victim. Since religion has be come tolerant and the friend of liberty, in France, the dissidents of this country have rebuilt their peaceful temples, and enjoy the right of profess ing the gospel in their own way. By this wise measure, if it is well adhered to, the new govern ment will for ever eradicate the tares of religion, the most fatal sources of discord, from the na tion. Italy. We have already noticed the reasons which ren dered a religious reform impracticable in Italy. We may also add the vicinity of the Holy See ; the interest ofall the small Italian states to be on good terms with it ; and, more especially, the * Should it not be permitted here to consider the punifli ment oft'alas as one of those events, which, from the notoriety given to it by Voltaire, and from the animated writings he published on the occasion, contributed the most to four all minds against the fanaticism of Catholic priests, and against the authority which supported them ? + It will be recollected that the king did not pay any atten tion to the intolerant Memoirede I' Assemblie giniralc du clergi, in 1780, against tbe reformed."], [193, "163 dread ofthe imperial arms, which would, instantly,, and without a possibility of resistance, have sacked the first state which scould have dared to scow itself favourable to Luther. Besides, the elegant Italian considered these people of the north with whom the reformation was effected, as little better than barbarians. The most enlightened of them applauded it in secret; more than one prince re joiced to see the Pope humbled ; but none of them durst risk appearing openly. Those who took a liking to the reform, went into Switzerland, or into other countries, where they might adopt it at ease, like the two Socini, natives of Sienna. Italy,. which had already lost so great a part of its com mercial importance, by the discovery of America., and of the Cape of Good Hope, wholly lost that by the reformation which the capital of the church gave it. The first of these events had deprived it of its commerce in spices, and the other produc tions ofthe east : the second took from it,.in part, that of indulgences and of benefices,, and dried up several of the sources of its riches. The arts of painting and of music, attached to this enchant- ing soil, continued to flourisc there;, but in true civilization, and the superior cultivation of the understanding, its people remained generally be hind the other European nations. The events which have since agitated Italy, and even those which have changed its aspect, depend very little,, if at all, upon the influence ofthe reformation. M 2 ..."], [194, "164 Poland. The vicinity of Bohemia and Germany, and the Latin generally spoken in Poland, gave the reformation an easy access into that country. There it made rapid and daring strides during the last half of the sixteenth century. The lax police ofthe small towns, and of the flat country, where every magnate, every individual lord, claimed a fort of sovereignty, made this country the re fuge of the most audacious sectaries, who were not suffered even in the Protestant states. They. came hither in crowds from Moravia, Silesia,. Bohemia, Sweden, Germany, and even from Switzerland. The two Socini, uncle and ne phew, but particularly the latter, made a great number of proselytes here, and founded the sect which bears their name ; a sect which has spread very much in Poland, the principal tenet of which is to honour J. C. as a sage sent by God, but not as one of the persons of the Divinity itself. All these different sects, which, in Poland, experi enced neither assent nor opposition from the cen tral government, could not, at first, on account of this toleration, acquire the life, the import ance, and the development which they acquired elsewhere; they remained individual opinions among the nobles, and did not produce any be neficial fermentation among a people composed of ignorant serfs. In principle, every thing was"], [195, "165 limited to the disputes of theologians with each other, and to the name of dissidents, given ge nerally to all who were not Catholics. But when Charles XII. undertook the conquest of Po land, and made a few partisans there, although perhaps the smallest number of these were dissi dents, still, the King of Sweden being a Lu theran, the suspicions of the Catholics turned to that sect, their hatred was kindled, and the dissi dents from thence forward became a political par ty, obliged to take arms in its own defence, and for the support of its rights. Dissident and par tisan of Sweden became synonyms. This event soon produced discord in a country the constitution of which exposed it too much to the animosity of factions, and in which it was not forgotten that Gustavus Adolphus had been the hero of the reform. When Charles XII. the promoter of these new divisions, was conquered and weakened, the Catholics became persecutors, and the dissidents were oppressed. The diet of 1 7 1 7 also began to deprive them of their civil rights. Hence the acrimony ofthe two parties could not be assuaged, even when the idea of a Swedisc faction had ceased. To crush the dissidents, became a maxim of the government and of the Catholic party. The Jesuits were principally employed for this purpose, and acquitted themselves with a method and a connected system which does ho nour to their sagacity. Thus at a period when the religious troubles of all Europe had ceased 5"], [196, "166 they began in wretched Poland. Its neighbours had long been accustomed to interfere in its do mestic concerns. The advantages which her policy might derive from these divisions among the Poles did not escape the penetrating eye of the great Catherine, when sce came to the throne of Russia. In 1764 and 1766, sce declared her self protectress of the dissidents. In 1768, a Russian minister and Russian soldiers gave laws to the diet, and arrested several of its principal members. The Catholics, in despair, formed a confederation at Bar. They applied to the Turks and French for assistance. Only the first appeared to wage an unfortunate war against Rus sia. The French contented themselves with send ing seme officers to the confederates, who prose cuted the civil war they had commenced with fury. At length Russia, which had brought Prussia and Austria into its views, proceeded to a first partition of Poland, which was followed by a second, and scertly, as is known, by a third, which definitively erased this country from the list of European states. The sanguinary expe dition which led to this last catastrophe recalls to mind the time when the right of war consist ed in the annihilation and general massacre of the conquered ; it is a worthy termination to the his tory of a society wherein civil wars, intestine convulsions, and the delirium of political and religious factions, were the ordinary scenes whic,h each generation saw renewed. 12"], [197, "167 Russia. The lion's scare which Russia obtained from Poland is the most important political event by which the influence of the reformation and of the religious troubles in Europe was felt in this country. We must, however, take into the ac count some of the ideas of administration, and government which Peter I. acquired in Holland and England ; more particularly, it must not be forgotten that his genius was roused and his mind enlightened by a child of the reform, the Gene vese Le Fort, who may, in fact, be considered as the real legislator of Russia. Besides, at the time of the reformation, this empire being with in the pale of the Greek church, took no part in the dissensions of the western church. But Peter I. having seen what was passing among the Protestant princes, at his return, effected a reform in the Russian church, of which he declared himself the supreme head, withdrawing his obe dience from the patriarch of Constantinople, as the Kings of England had separated from Rome. Perhaps it may also be necessary to consider the influence which the Protestant and liberal educa tion of the young princess of Zerbst, at the court of Brunswick, may have had on the ever memor able reign of this princess, under the name of Catherine II. The toleration of the Czars drew colonies of sectaries into many parts of the vast empire of Russia, as well from our southern countries, as from Poland, Germany and Holland. The anabaptists, and the Moravian brethren,"], [198, "168 have several establiscments there. There are also propagated the sects of Ascetic Christians, who lead a sort of conventual life, under the name of Theodostans, Phillipons, and Rafkolnicks, and who have all the enthusiasm and fervour ofthe ancient Cenobites. Some Dutchmen had also establisced several flouriscing colonies on the banks of the , Wolga, in the early part ofthe reign of Catherine II. The brigand Pugatfchef soon afterwards ex terminated them. SECOND POINT OF VIEW. External and respective Situation ofthe States of Europe with each other. \u2014 System of Equilibrium. Before the fifth century of our era, the greatest part of Europe was Roman, and consequently subjected to a certain uniformity of action. What was not Roman endeavoured to maintain its independence against the common enemy of all nations, and to this was confined all the political system of that age. When the various nations of the north and north-east invaded the south and west, a chaos which lasted several centuries confounded the whole of Europe. The wandering hordes of new conquerors founded empires of a day, which were quickly destroyed by new hordes who drove the first farther on. By degrees, however, these irregular oscillations slackened ; dominations were settled : and groupes of small states were establisced on the foil of"], [199, "169 the ancient divisions of Europe. In Germany, Gaul, Italy, Iberia, and England, these species of confederations were formed, the limits and constitution of which varied often, and, in which the right of the strongest was almost the only public right. This new state was but one step towards another, better regulated. The lead ers of these anarchial aggregates, in which every possessor of a fief set up for a sovereign, at length strengthened their paramount authority, reduced a number of small princes to the condition of subjects, and thus founded durable powers, mo narchies, and empires. But during the infancy of this new order, the confusion and anarchy were still great. The Gothic Kings of Spain, contended with the Moorisc kings, who had come from Africa : the Kings of France fought against the Kings of England, who had invaded a part of their provinces, against the Dukes of Brittany, Burgundy, Lorraine, and others : Italy was the prey of eternal invasions; of conquests followed by defeats; of a flux and reflux of armies which succeeded each other: Hungary was con tended for by the Mussulmen and the Imperialists : Germany saw civil wars incessantly arising, with out object and without end, between its different princes. There were, therefore, as many political systems in Europe, as groupes of states within the limits of each country ; and in each of these systems ignorance and disorder generally reigned. The interest of the moment, or the local interest, de-"], [200, "170 determined every thing; each one thought only of his own danger, or his own design ; their ill arranged alliances were of scort duration: the attention of their statesmen seldom passed the boundaries of one country; Hungary was no thing to England, Sweden was nothing to Spain; the political bodies had not acquired that uni versal contact which now makes a confederation of states in Europe, already embracing almost all the old and the new world. It is true, momen tary alliances were formerly entered into; but they were mostly without consistence, without any fixed and durable plan. To be convinced of this, we need only attend to the history of the greater part of these alliances ; that for exam ple, of the absurd and ridiculous league of Cam bray, of which our guileless Louis XII. was the dupe. It must however be acknowledged that the multiplicity of negotiations, of transient leagues of this period, exposed the necessity, which began to be generally felt, ofa union, a reciprocal support, a stability of principles. The partial systems had nearly found their centres of gravity; that of the total system was to be sought. It has been already said that the crusades had, for the first time, accustomed the western nations to a general union, a sort of European frater nity. Catholicism produced this good effect: for a continuance. The pontifical monarchy taught princes and nations to consider themselves as compatriots^ being all' equally subjects of"], [201, "171 Rome. This centre of unity was, for some cen turies, a real benefit to the human race. But it derived its power from opinion, and from the acquiescence of princes. But from the time when abuses of too great magnitude had disgusted opinion; when princes had humbled the popes; when a long schism had offered to undirected Christianity the spectacle of several popes at once, who claimed the fame power, and, of councils, which, in their turn, aspired to be superior to all these pontiffs, this centre of unity lost its at tractive force, and the general system, which was insensibly detaching itself from it, was menaced with falling again into a chaos. Masses, how ever, had been formed, sufficiently powerful to become centres of action in a new order. Aus tria, which then predominated, France, England, and Spain had acquired great internal consistence; these powerful bodies were in presence of each other, and it required only one decisive occurrence to bring them into contact, to render them rivals orfriends ; inaword, toconnectthem closely. This event was the reformation, and the wars to which it gave rise.* * A writer of great talents fays, \" The interests which had hitherto been national, ceased to be so, in proportion as a religious interest united men of different countries, and sub jects of different governments, who had formerly been stran gers to each other. The difference in language, manners, and character had raised a wall of separation between the na tions ot Europe which nothing had been able to lhake. It"], [202, "172 The new interests to both princesand nation, pro duced in men's minds by this religious reformation, became a general concern of Christianity in the ag gregate, and no longer depended on the localities was destroyed by the reformation of the church. A senti- ment of greater power over the heart of man than even the love of his country, had rendered him capable of seeing and feeling beyond the limits of his country. The French Calvi- nist felt a greater relation with the English, German, Dutch, or Genevese Calvinist, than with his Catholic countrymen. The triumph of the Batavian armies was more grateful to him than the triumph of the armies of his sovereign, who fought for the papacy. Thus the men who were formerly troops employed by princes in their personal affairs, became gradually the judges of their own destinies, and were actuated by views arising from their dearest affections. \u2014 The assistance which would not have been granted without repugnance to a simple neighbour, was lavished with zeal on an associate in the same creed. The Palatine quitted his own country to defend, against the enemy of his religion, the Frenchman who had adopted it. The Frenchman quitted a country where his conscience was not at liberty, and he was subjected to a thousand vexations, to shed his blood for the salvation of Holland. On the banks of the Loire and the Seine, Swiss and Germans were seen sighting against Swiss and Germans, for the order of succession to the throne of France. The Dane quitted his marshes, the Swede his icy regions, to come and break the chains prepared for Germany. By these new bonds all were taught to e.\\tend their good-will beyond the narrow limits of their country, and to mi.\\ with the great human family \u2022 and, ceasing to be attached to the glebe of a certain district of the earth, they became Euro peans, citizens ofthe world.\"\u2014 Schiller's Hisiory of the Thirty Years War. Vol. 1."], [203, "173 of any country in particular, but exceeding them all in importance. States which had scarcely ex isted to each other, then began to feel a sympathy which led to a union. France formed an alliance with Sweden ; England with Holland ; Bavaria with Spain. Their views, being enlarged, en larged also their foresight, and gave birth to pre cautions. Their interest having become common, required common measures. The designs of the house of Austria were discovered and openly re sisted. To find a counterpoise which could ba lance this ambitious power, and prevent it from rising at pleasure became an affair of the utmost importance to the newly coalesced Europe. Hence the fruitful idea of an equilibrium between the European powers ; an idea which was the foul of the negotiations in Westphalia, and has become a principal consideration in all the public affairs of Europe, rii^:e the Treaty which was the result of it. Austria and the Catholic states were then placed in one scale, and, in the other, all the powers which had fought for the reform, including also France. The principle of the European equilibrium was therefore, in reality, only the opposition of the Catholic party and the reformed party. New circumstances soon supervened, which gave it a totally different aspect : but, in general, it may be considered as the division of the political bodies of Europe into two groupes, nearly equal in strength, and in each of which"], [204, "174 sometimes one and sometimes another of the pow ers bears the principal sway. Before the states of Europe entered into an aggregate system of connection, Italy and Ger many had, for a long time, formed individual systems, or confederations, in which- the common policy of each of the states endeavoured to main tain a certain equilibrium, and to restrain one party by another. It is possible that this par tial equilibrium may have been the type from. which the idea of a general equilibrium was form ed: but how much more extensive and accurate were the views which flowed from this ! Politics, which, in Italy especially, had hitherto been a a tissue of low craft, petty perfidies, intrigues, cruelties, and meannesses, became more expanded and more liberal ; its principles were more evi dent, and better known : the greater part of the powerful governments who took part in negotia tions by their ministers, mutually enlightened each other. Among these governments, some were animated by frankness and good faith : the mean Italian spirit was gradually banisced from cabinets. There is no doubt but a little k^ivery still enters into politics, and that deceit is prac tised here and there ; but reciprocal deceit is nei ther so easy, nor even so necestary as formerly. Since the long and universal war in which every power was involved by the reformation, it has been found that true politics consisted in real"], [205, "175 strength ; and that this had its origin in the pros perity of the state, in commerce, a good public spirit, and the attachment of the citizens to the government. The strength and resources of each state were known to all the others. Statistics renders this knowlege more and more exact, and mutual imposition is now scarcely practicable. Every one feels that it is necessary to protect his ally against inimical enterprizes ; that the weak must be pro tected against the powerful, who would become too much so by aggrandizement. An exclusive egotism has therefore ceased to be the dominant spirit os European politics : the state which aims at raising itself is watched and repressed; that which is on the point of falling is supported : the disproportionate elevation of any power only tightens the bonds which unite the others. Even the smallest states have acquired a real importance in this system. Precaution and good-will, exter nally ; within, the development ofthe total strength by a good administration: such is, in general, the new tendency which politics have taken since the great conflict produced by the reformation."], [206, "176 First Periodof the Equilibrium os Europe, from 1520 to 1556. Charles V. and Francis I. were the two principal actors in the events of this period. The colossal increase of the Austrian power was the first cause which scowed other states the necessity ofa closer alliance among them. From thenceforward the situation of France was fixed, and, from thenaturc of things, its monarch became the most formida ble rival to Charles. But it was not easy to bring about an alliance of interested states, and to make this confederation act with the requisite effect and energy. The reformation came, and supplied the means; and, by its assistance, the European oppo sition was organized with facility. Henry VIII. who might have held an honourable rank in it, drew back; he dreaded appearing subordinate to Francis I. and at length was too much engaged with his mistresses and theology. In revenge, Francis introduced the Ottoman power into the new system. France, Turkey, and the Protestant princes of the north, were the first united mass destined to be a counterpoise to German Austria, Spain, and Burgundy. These two masses formed themselves, one around the Protestant party, and the other around the Catholic party, in Germany. It was generally felt that the equilibrium in the empire would decide that of the rest of Europe ; and, that if Charles V. triumphed over the Protest ant princes, his power would become irresistible."], [207, "177 Henry ll. who succeeded Francis I. formed 2 close alliance with Maurice of Saxony. At length, in 1556, the formidable Charles V. disappeared from the theatre of events, and scut himself up in a cloister: his German states were separated from the Spanisc monarchy and Burgundy, which were the lot of his son Philip. A change became per ceptible in the European system. Second Period, from 1556 to 1603. > Philip II. of Spain, and Elizabeth of England, became the two ostensible personages ; the one at the head of the Catholic, the other at the head of. the Protestant party. The peaceful Rodolph II. suffered Austria and the rest of Germany to take breath. The scene of events was transported to a new theatre. Great Britain was Protestant, and the Low Countries revolted against Philip. Spain, on the one hand, fighting for .popery ; England and the United Provinces, on the other, fighting for the reform, sill the history of this period. The new republic, scarcely born, attains to the rank of the first powers. The over-strained spring of oppression had provoked the reaction of the spring of liberty in it; the efforts made to subdue it had no other effect than accelerating the development of all its strength. If France had not then lan guisced under weak prmces, who seemed to be devoid of energy, except in feeding factions, yield ing. to fanaticism, and persecuting their Protest- N"], [208, "178 ant subjects; if it had not been reduced to support the miserable, contradictory, and difficult character of a protector ofthe reform, without, and its ene my within, no doubt it might easily have sup ported the Ba-tavian league with a powerful hand, and attached it to itself for ever, to the prejudice os England. The latter has since made good use of thus attachment of Holland, which France ne glected. It would be superfluous to detail here all we have lost by it during two centuries, and all which our rivals have gained : every body knows it too well. In the preceding period, land armies decided the fate ofthe war; in this, the geographical po sition of the two countries required fleets ; and the phenomenon of maritime powers contending on the seas, was seen for the first time in modern Eu rope. Since this time, the superiority of naval ar mies has become of still more decisive consequence than that of land armies. The merchants of Hol land have possessed themselves of a considerable part of the navigation of the two worlds, and scow what a commercial state may become by the sole aid of its vessels. The religious spirit had given rise to the new republic ; but it also gave rise to the spirit of commerce, which, by degrees, made the first lose its influence, and,, at length, wholly disappear; and took its place in politics. Thus every thing is connected in the destiny of states, and yields to a mutual development. In the struggk which employed all this period-. 6"], [209, "179 the opposition of the two religious parties was more marked than before, since one was wholly Catholic, and the other Protestant, without mix ture. Now, as the Catholic party fought for the royal authority against rebellious subjects, and the Protestants fought in support of these same rebels, and for the foundation ofa republic, it has been since received as an avowed and fundamental maxim of state, that Catholicism was the best sup port of absolute power, while Protestantism fa voured rebellion and a republican spirit. Even at the present day, this maxim is not relinquisced by many statesmen. It may have its true side ; but we have already shown in what manner. The powerful Elizabeth died after Philip ,- the United Provinces subsisted by themselves; anew period was preparing in the European equili brium. Third Period, from 1603 to 164S. The preceding period had only been an inter lude to the long commotions in Germany ; an in terlude which supplied the stage with the liberty of Holland, and the civil wars of France. After six years of war, and three of trouble and uncer tainty, the league of Smalcald had obtained from Charles V. tired and enfeebled, the peace of Augf burgh, which was dated in 1553, but was not en tirely consolidated by the emperor until 1555, \u00ab few months before he abdicated the throne* In N 2"], [210, "180 1618, the war between the emperor and the Pro testant princes broke out again with more vio lence than ever, and lasted for thirty successive years, until the treaty of VVSstphalia put an end to it in 1648. Spain had again become inert. England was agitated by terrible convulsions, which have been already noticed in the article appropriated to that power. Henry IV. had ascended the throne of France ; but the early years ofthe reign of this great prince were consumed in the re-establisc ment of what had been overturned in the interior of the kingdom, by so many scocks. If Provi dence had thought it right to leave him longer to his people, whose idol he was, from what evils might his genius have relieved Europe! The war of thirty years would either have been prevented by him, or it would have been sooner terminated. He had already restored France to her rank, and her importance. Thus he had again brought it into its natural place, that is to fay, with respect to Austria, which he had resolved to curb. He was become the protector of the Protestant party in Germany, and had resolved to maintain the peace and equilibrium ofthe European republic. Who can ascertain how much the will of such a hero, seconded by such a minister as Sully, might have influenced the world ? The project for peace is known; this in the head ofthe Abbe St. Pierre could only beadrearh; but in that of a powerful mo narch there were^at least, some means of realizing it."], [211, "181 Henrywas snatched fromtheworldinthemidstofhis brilliant career. France, after his time, fell again into a paroxysm of weakness and anarchy, under a minor king. She formed an alliance with Spain which had done her so much injury, and became the sport of all the petty intrigues of the Italian court of Mary de Medici's. It was not until 1624 that the skilful hand of Richelieu was effectually applied for its welfare. Thus it was disabled from having any weight at the commencement of this period. In 1630, Sweden appeared on the theatre of war in Germany; and France was not long in joining her; The armies of the two countries rivalled each other in courage, as did their leaders, in ta lents. It must not, however, be concealed, that the part of the Swedes, who fought boldly in the cause of their religion, was better supported, and more uniformly heroic ; and the intrinsic weakness of Sweden rendered these efforts more worthy of admiration. Austria, Spain, the Pope, Bavaria, and some of the small Catholic states, on the one side ; France, Sweden, and the Protestant states of Germany, on the other, formed the two princi pal groupes ofthe European equilibrium, towards the close of this period. They remained the fame at the celebrated negotiations for peace. Austria there saw its fate determined. France and Sweden became the guarantees ofa treaty which regulated the future order of the empire.

Sweden soon declined ; France rose ; and new variations supervened in the equilibrium of Eu rope. But it is not necessary to follow them. From this time the influence of the reformation, at least the immediate influence, cease to be manifested in it. Religious interest is no long er the dominant principle of activity in cabi nets-. The ambition of Louis XIV. the Spa nisc succession, the colonies, the establiscment of Prussia, the intervention of Great Britain in the affairs of the continent, and other events also occurred to fill the scene. Nevertheless, the support of the equilibrium continues to be the fundamental law of the politics of Europe: and, now, when new events have, for a scort time, disordered this balance, we fee the heads of [nations eagerly seeking to re-establisc it, not, it is true, with the fame materials, but still on the fame basis as before. Individuals change in the political order, as in the other parts of nature, but the laws of the great whole remain constantly the fame. Summary ' Recapitulation of the Results of the Reformation with Respect to Politics. Europe, plunged for several centuries in a stu por and apathy, interrupted only by wars, or rather by incursions and robberies, without any"], [213, "183 beneficial object to humanity, received at once a new life and a new activity. An universal and, deep interest agitated the nations; their powers were developed, their minds expanded by new political ideas: Former revolutions had only exercised men's arms; this employed their heads. The people who, before, had been only estimated as flocks passively subject ro the caprice of their leaders, now began to act for themselves, and to feel their importance and utility. Those who embraced the reform, made common cause with their princes for liberty; and hence arose a closer bond, a community of interest and of action, be tween the sovereign and his subjects. Both were for ever delivered from the excessive and burthen some power of the clergy, as w7ell as from the struggle, so distressing to all Europe, and which had endured so long between the popes and the emperors, to know which of them scould retain the supreme power. Social order was regulated and brought nearer to perfection. The Austrian power was confined within proper limits; that of France was raised and made head against it; the necessity of durable alliances began to be felt ; the political bodies of Europe formed a connected system of equilibrium, a regularly organized ag gregate, of which even the idea was not formerly entertained. States, such as Sweden and Turkey, which had scarcely had an existence for the others, gained a rank and an importance in this system. Some, such as Holland, originated from this great"], [214, "184 mock, and acquired much preponderance from their origin. The foundations of the Prussian monarchy and the American republic were laid. A general spirit arose in politics, and embraced all Eu rope. The art of negotiation was improved and became more liberal and more certain; the pro gress of affairs, clearer and more simple. In this state of intercourse and contact, commo tions and wars became more general, but they were also sooner terminated, and their rigour was lightened by a more humane law of nations. If France had been Protestant, sce would have fought more zealously for the cause of Protestant ism, and the. struggle might, perhaps, have been scorter. But an equivalent advantage to huma nity might nevertheless result from her being Ca tholic : that is, men became gradually habituated to toleration and to the fraternity of sects, more especially when they saw a very powerful minister habited in the Roman purple, Cardinal, Riche lieu, make common cause; and enter into strict alliance with Protestant Sweden, and all the league of heretic princes of Saxony. InoneLpart of Europe the church ceased to form an extraneous state within the state; from which it was easy to foretell that this change would one day he effected through the whole pf it, .and that its head would be reduced to the simple, .spiritual primacy. At length, the Catholic clergy reformed their conduct on the example of the Protestants, and gained in man^"], [215, "185 ners, knowledge, \u2022 and esteem, as much as they lost in power and riches. Almost all the European governments, however, increased in their power, and internal strength: the Protestant ones, because they were united with the mass of the people, and had appropriated to themselves the wealth, prerogatives, and jurisdic tion of the church; the Catholics, because they had placed themselves on a formidable war esta bliscment, had overthrown the Protestants in their own states, and thus subjugated one part of their people by another, the citizens by the soldiers. X mo: After the discovery of America and the Cape of Good Hope, the commerce of the two worlds was concentrated in the hands of Spain and Por tugal. But these two countries, like almost all others, before the sixteenth century, had only a throne and no people: all the national activity resided in the government. The ignorance of princes was employed in conducting a commerce as greedy as it was ill understood, the profits of which were absorbed by the luxury or unskilful ness ofthe court. ' How much longer might a true commercial spirit, navigation, the exploring of seas, have languisced, had not two states, actuated by the reformation, (states in which the whole nation exerted all its powers, lavisced its re sources and seconded the action of the govern ment,) found themselves led, and, as it were, forced to seize the trident? Without the religious com-"], [216, "186 motion produced by Luther, the order of events would have been different: Holland, a poor por tion of the Austrian states, would have remained without a marine and without commerce; Eng land would not have had that volcanic force, or that direction which turned it against Spain.

On the Progress of Knowledge. \" It is about two hundred years since a man of genius, having discovered and collected in contestible proofs ofthe motion ofthe earth, was condemned, as an heretic, to perpetual imprison ment, by the tribunal of the inquisition. Now, a complete treatise on the celestial mechanism is freely publisced. Its illustrious author sees the sciences honoured in his person, by the most dignified men of the state.. ..What a progress in so scort a time, and what a career has been gone over since Galileo!\" This was the language of Citizen Biot, lately, in announcing the third volume of the immortal work of the senator Laplace. This ingenuous observation of a distinguisced votary of the sciences, who in writing it perhaps had no thought of Luther's reformation, contains, never theless, in an implicit manner, this certain re sult; that is to fay, that the ancient system of Roman Catholicism was diametrically opposite to the progress of knowledge ; and that an event which has contributed to free the human mind from such an adversary, ought to be considered as one of the most fortunate epochs in she irttel-"], [218, "188 Iectual culture of modern nations. The opposite system of liberality, of examination, of free criti cism, establisced by the reformation, has become the \u00c6gis under which the Galileos, of subsequent ages, the Kepler s, the New-tons, the Leibnitzes, the Hevels, and, finally the Laplace s, have been enabled securely to develop their exalted con ceptions. But in this really immense career, passed through by the human mind, during three cen turies, how can we distinguisc the progress which the reformation alone has enabled it to make? So many causes have contributed to the intellectual culture of this period! The refor mation, as has been already observed, was itself only a first effect of the restoration of knowledge. This effect, however, must have become a cause in its turn; it must have influenced subsequent events. But in what degree, and in what manner? Has the reformation accelerated, or has it retarded the progress of the human mind ? Has it been favourable or injurious to it? Writers of emi nence have supported each opinion. Must one ofthe two be adopted without reserve? Is it more expedient to take a middle course? * The author of this essay will freely avow his opi nion, and endeavour tojustify it.

The good which it produced is a result ofthe spirit which constitutes its essence: the evils it has occasioned depend in a great de gree on the incidents with which it was accom panied, on the resistance opposed to it, and on the foreign motives joined to it. It is therefore necessary to consider two things here, which can not be blended without injustice : the one is the moral impulse given, primitively, by the refor mation; the other is the commotion which re suited from it, wh^en, to this primitive impulse, so many other things were added, which modi- fied it in different ways and changed its nature : in a word, in the reformation, the spirit and the event, the intention and the effect must be con- sidered."], [220, "190 SECT. I. Results of the moral Impulse given by the Reformation. JT rom what has been said in several passages of this work, on the nature of the reformation, the direction which its moral impulse must have had, and the objects to whidh it extended, may be ea- sily presumed. The intention of the reformers was, in principle, to free themselves from the despotism and infallibility of the popes ; to de- pend only on the sacred writings for the grounds of their belief; and, in scort, to overthrow the scholastic divinity which was become the foul of the Roman theology, and the firm support ofthe hierarchy. Hence it follows that, in its essence, the reformation must have had an influence on the liberty of thought, so precious to man, and the basis of his civil liberty ; on the manner of contemplating religion, of establiscing the proofs of it, and of interpreting the scriptures ; in the third place, on philosophy, and on the ramifica tions ofthe tree of science arising from any of these three principal points.

It is not asserted that in the Catholic countries named above, men of superior tilents, and eminent in their age, have not b^en met with ; but they are rare, and it is the masses of the nations which are to be compared. Without doubt, considering the close connection in which the nations of our little Europe live together, it is impossible that the knowledge of some scould be prevented from penetrating a little among the rest. The wall of separation cannot be sufficiently strengthened, nor so strictly guarded as that the individuals on each side cannot have communi cation. But certainly on the part ofthe Catho lics, the precautions for repelling the liberal ideas of Protestantism from the limits of their terri tories, like a dangerous epidemy, have' not been neglected. It was at Rome that the first cen sures of books were invented, and the example was religiously followed by the governments de voted to Rome. Leo X. this vaunted protector of the arts, in 1515, promulgated some severe 2"], [223, "193 regulations against the printing and publiscing of books translated from the Greek, Hebrew, or Arabic.

It was of the utmost importance to them to show with precision that this passage was muti lated, or not well interpreted ; that that expression had, at the time in which it was written, a totally different meaning from that which was now attri buted to it, and so of the rest. Hence, to them the study of orientalism, ofthe sacred antiquities, (which are intimately connected with the profane antiquities of the east) and, finally, that of lan guages, which are the necessary key to them, be came indifpensible. They were obliged to in vestigate and attain an exact knowledge of places,' manners, events, ideas, the whole intellectual cui-' ture, the political and private state of the diffe rent nations, during the periods when this pro phet, or that evangelist had written.

Even in our own days we see striking proofs of it in the erudition of the learned men ofthe north, who, more remote than the other Europeans from the countries in which the beau ties of antiquity have flourisced, seem neverthe less to secure to themselves the domination over them, in their scientific excursions. The Italians tread upon Herculaneum, and disinter its won ders; they multiply museums and collections; it is for Winkelmann they amass these materials : by their assistance, he rediscovers the thread of lhe art ; he writes the annals of it ; he becomes its legislator. From this acute study of the oriental and Greek arch\u00e6ologia by the Protestant theologians, applied to the interpretation of the sacred books, a per fection and richness, which it was very far from having before, has resulted to the science called Exegesis, or a critical examination of the text of the scriptures, which forms an important part of their studies. Exegesis has several branches. That which relates particularly to languages and anti quities, to a knowledge of times, places, and au thors, is called hermeneutic. The Englisc in par- ticular, the Swiss, the Dutch, and the Germans have carried this science very far. There the va rious fragments, books, poems, or treatises which compose the bible (in as far as they are consi-"], [234, "204 dered as works written in a certain age and A certain nation) are interpreted, commented on, and restored to their true meaning. There the Pentateuch is explained with the fame care and the fame penetration as the poems of Hestod or Homer, in profane arch\u00e6ologia. The scholia written on the book of Job ; -on those of Isaiah and Jeremiah -, on the Psalms ; on Solomon's Song, &c. throw an entire new slight on these precious remains of oriental antiquity, on their authors, and on the spirit of the age in which they were written. The mythology of the nation and of the neighbouring people is developed and un folded in them. The hermeneutic labours on the books of the New Testament are not less import ant. The gospels, the acts and the epistles of the apostles, the apocalypse itself, submitted to criticism like historical passages, give rise to inquiries and dissertations which cannot be read without the most lively interest. In thus tracing the sacred historians and poets through the Egyptian, Arabian, Syriac, Chaldean, Samaritan, Persian, Greek, and Roman antiquity; in analyz ing their language, their manners, their dispo sitions, the culture and ideas of their cotemporai ries, they have cultivated an extensive region of the domain of antiquity, and have thrown a light upon a part of the archives of the human race, which is greatly essential tous.* * See on this subject a Discourse delivered on the opening of the Protestant academy of Strasburgh, on the 15th BruruaLr*?,"], [235, "205 All the Protestant universities have professors, by whom exegesis, the hermeneutic, and other sciences which depend _upon it, are in general taught with credit.

These recluses, very ill-informed respecting the transactions of the world, seldom impartial, gave merit to princes only in proportion as they had endowed their convents, or rendered services to the church. They mixed a multitude of fables, superstitions, and maledictions against heretics, with these de formed annals. Where was then the muse of history with such ministers? In a few instances they have done some service : but how much more would human reason, which they held in bondage for ages, have done for itself, if it had been suffered to act without constraint?

The reason of this prefe rence is clearly expressed in these words of Mably : \" In fact, it is not worti, while to write history, to make it only a poison, like Strada, who, sacrificing the dignity of the Low Countries to that ofthe court of Spain, invites its subjects to servitude, and thus prepares the progress of despotism. If this histo rian is to be credited, Philip II. might trample under his feet all the laws, all the treaties, all the agreements with his sub jects because he held his crown from God ; and this danger ous casuist condemns the Low Countries to suffer patiently the ruin of their privileges and the most cruel oppression, that they may not render themselves culpable of a sacrilegious disobedience It is to this ignorance of natural rights, or to that baseness with which the greater part of modern histo rians betray their consciences by flattery, that the disgusting insipidity of their works is owing. Why is Grotius so supe rior to them? It is because, having meditated deeply on the rights and the duties of society, I find in him the elevation and the energy of the ancients.

The first example of such a pic ture was given at Kiel by the illustrious Morhoff, in his book entitled, Polyhistor. With Respect to Philosophy ; to the moral and political Sciences A revolution began by a reform in religious opinions, could not fail to awaken the philoso phical spirit in man, which is so intimately con nected with mystical speculations, with the ideas ofa divinity, ofa future life for him, in another world, and of his moral duties in this. It has been already sufficiently shown above, what an imperfect philosophy reigned in the schools be fore the reformation, and what an extravagant and puerile dialectic was amalgamated with the system of the Roman theology, which maintained itself by its aid. To support this system was, in fact, sor many centuries, the only end ofall philosophy; the theologians, who were generally monks, were the only philosophers. Their subtle, and some times risible arguments, tended only to the sup port of orthodoxy, against innovators and heretics : it never entered their heads to teach a useful mo rality to human society ; they only employed them selves in establiscing the rights ofthe Pope and the clergy, but never those of the people, nor of in dividuals. To reason conformably to the views of the Roman church, at that period, it is evident that it must only be done in a certain manner, and"], [243, "213 \u00a9n certain subjects. To reason in a new manner, and to extend the reasoning of subjects considered, till then, sacred and inviolable, was to loosen the bases of the edifice. A firm, independent philoso phy, which aspired at becoming universal, was, in this state of things, a monstrosity, consequently no thing of this description existed before the reforma tion. A strange mixture of disguised propositions of peripatetifm, which was applied in the strangest manner to matters of faith and controversy, formed all the ground-work ofthe doctrine of the schools. Subsequent to the renovation of letters, some men of talents, with the famous Erasmus at their head, had opposed this monkisc barbarism. But, remaining in the bosom of a church to which scholastic divinity had become an indispensible auxiliary, how could they labour effectually to destroy this support. Such an undertaking could only be accomplisced by reformers bold enough to quit this church, and to establisc one separate from it, on the pure principles of the gospel and of reason. It was in this manner that the refor mation'dethroned the scholastic divinity. Protestants and Catholics, having entered into a competition in the study of Greek, to acquire a knowledge of the original writings in this language, read also the works of Aristotle, which they pro cured from among thcdust ofthe libraries. With what surprise did they find that their contents were totally different from what had been, for centuries, taught in the name of this great man 1 They dis covered that the grotesque pagoda, so revered in"], [244, "214 the schools under the imposing name of Aristotle, did not in any manner resemble the philosophy ofthe Stagyrite. Melancthon laboured to obtain evidence of this new conviction. He laid down the true doctrine of Aristotle, in favour of which he declared, and he allowed it to be valid in every thing which came within thcjurifdiction of human reason, but at the same time, contended most strenuously, that it ought to be excluded from the domain of theology. They did not confine them selves to reading the original books of Aristotle : the discoveries they had made in them inspired the learned men of this century with the desire of extending their investigations to all that remained of the monuments of the ancient philosophy. The writings of the Pythagoreans, those of the two schools of Plato, the old and the new academies, those of the Stoic and Epicurean schools, were read, interpreted, and their different doctrines publicly taught. Then began a philosophical period, during which the interest in truths ofa su perior order, in the discussion ofthe most sublime rules of logic, metaphysics, and morality, acquired an activity which had been lost to it for many centuries. The perusal of the precious remains of antiquity, from its connection with the speculative sciences, became again to the moderns, what it had been in the age of Petrarch, from its connec tion with poetry. It would be necessary to follow all the devia tions ofthe philosophical spirit during this period;"], [245, "215 to scow all the various forms which it assumed, either in the systems alternately borrowed and mo- dified from the ancients, or in those created by modern genius \u2022, it would be necessary to state what these deviations had been in, so many comprehen- sive minds as those of Agrippa, Bacon, Cherbury, Descartes, Spinosa, Gajfendi, Pascal, Mallebranche, Locke, Leibnitz, Wolf, Bayle, Berkeley, Z3c. &c. to give a complete idea of this period ;* but so ex tensive a picture cannot enter into the narrow li mits of this work. It is sufficient to our purpose to have scovvn the scare which the reformation had in this great agitation ofthe human mind.| * It is to be observed, that, at that time, philosophy had its martyrs. Bruno was burnt alive at Rome, in lfiOO; Vanini at Toulouse, in lt)19; and Kuhlmann at Moscow, in 1686: the two former, Italians by birth, as atheists. t It would be too easy to make this essay, which can be no more than a simple'fketch, a voluminous history, filled with de- tails and compilations. In this article, for example, which re- lates to the influence of the reformation on philosophical stu- dies, it would only be necessary to copy every thing interesting on this subject, inserted by Brucker in the fourth volume of his History of Philosophy, lib. II. Cap. I.

In the latter, philosophy could only be considered as a sort of disturber of the public peace, or rather of the public apathy, which, in the eye6 of a considerable number of people, amounts to the fame thing. In Austria, Italy, and Spain, this philosophical flasc was soon extin guisced, and the usual torpidity resumed the upper hand. Even in France, a country, which as we have several times scown, is by no means to be put on a level with the other Catholic countries, the philosophical spirit was at an end soon after Descartes, who, as is known, sound the greatest number of partisans and opponents in Holland. The interest in truths, or in the philosophical sys tems, on the contrary, far from losing any part of its activity, seemed to be constantly increasing among the Englisc, the Dutch, the Swiss, and the Germans of the north. London, Halle, and Geneva, became the schools from whence the French derived their erudition : Locke and Hume, Wolf and Bonnet became our masters; the modest plurality of the small number of the national think ers, attached themselves sometimes to one, some times to another of these great men, and more particularly to the first. Their works, the pro duce of a Protestant soil, became our classical and fundamental works in philosophy."], [247, "217 When, however, for some lustres, the philoso phical spirit seemed deadened in England and Holland, it revived in Germany more powerfullv than ever, and with a depth and energy which it had not had since the best times of Greece. It is indebted to the immortal Kant for this new flight. Kant ha* laid down principles, and arrived at im mutable results, which will remain for ever as the cardinal points of the mind, as brilliant light houses in the darkness of metaphysical researches. The schools, the offspring of his, are powerful adherents of his doctrine when they follow and examine it ; they often lose themselves when they deviate from it. However this may be, it is de monstrated to every one who observes the progress ofthe intellectual culture of nations with atten tion, that the doctrine of the philosopher of Kcenigsourgh could not, on the one hand, excite so profound an enthusiasm, and on the other, so vigorous an opposition, such powers of reasoning, except in a country where the grand questions on the relations of human reason to nature, and to universal reason, were habitual to its inhabitants, that is to fay, in a country where they think with freedom on the objects ofa purified religion, and where the most exalted ideas ofthe high destination osman, are universally diffused. Nothing is more pure, more religious, more strict, more stoical, than the moral doctrine of the most celebrated schools of Germany, whether that of Kant, or that of Jacobi. The superficial lessons, the errors of"], [248, "218 Helvelius and his associates, were never able to take root in this soil. For the influence of the reforma tion on the study of morality has been as decisive, as on that of the other branches of philosophy. This science, which is the fame to the conduct of man, as metaphysics is to his knowledge, had, after the last ofthe Roman moralists, fallen into an almost total oblivion. It is known that the fa- thers ofthe church, who exerted every resource of their minds in the controversies on tenets, did very little or even nothing, for the moral sciences. The scholastics did still less ; and under their long domination, true morality disappeared entirely, and gave place to a casuistic degenerated morality, in which the duties of man towards God and to- ward* his fellows, were almost wholly reduced to his duties to the church: here a mutiplicity of practical superstitions and subtleties corresponded but too well to the superstition and subtleties ofthe theology of these dark ages. When the gospel had regained its rank, and displaced casuistry, the pure and divine morality announced in it, also resumed its place in the pulpits and the writings of the spi- ritual pastors. Besides, the reading of the ancient philosophers in the original works, must have fa- miliarized men to their different moral principles. They compared these principles with each other, and with that of Christianity. Hence the study of morality acquired a high degree of interest, to which it would never have attained, if casuistry had remained dominant, and the pulpits ofthe"], [249, "219 churches, and the schools, had remained in the power of the monks. Now it has become, to the ministers ofthe Protestant worscip, the most es sential, and almost the only ground of their pre cepts to the people, the inexhaustible text of their discourses. It makes one of the most important objects ofthe public instruction in the universities. It is well known what a number of excellent writ ings on this subject have been produced by the different Protestant churches, particularly in the last century; what a spirit of purity, of humanity, and of religion, they display ; at the same time equally remote from the ascetic fanaticism of the ages of ignorance, as from the stern and cyrenaic egotism of the ages which are called more enlight ened.* With respect to that morality of states, which, rising superior to individual relations, fixes the respective rights of societies and of their members, those of princes and of citizens, as also those of nations with each other; which gives the theory of the laws, that of the right of nature, and that of * M. St\u0153udlin, professor of theology at Gottingen, has givena very good history of the attempts which have been made by philosophers, to treat morality scientifically.

Milton, who laboured to defend the long parlia ment of England, and to justify the puniscment of Charles I. to the human race,- composed several political books, which breathed the most ardent republicanism, and among others his Defence ofthe people of England, against Saumaife. Some of these productions, full of the vehemence and anger of the parties which then clasced with such fury, too frequently overscot their object ; but they, at least, served to point it out, to inspire the wisc of attain ing it, and effectually to attract attention, These scortly gave way to the superior productions of wise and penetrating minds, which re-created the science of the right of nature and of people. Bacon foresaw the necessity ; he projected the basis of it, as well as almost all the parts of the philosophical edifice. It was reserved for the immortal Grotius to carry light into the midst of darkness, to class and arrange the principles, and to offer to Europe the first book in which the rights and duties of men in society were laid down with energy, precision, and wisdom. Why did sean Jacques, so great, so much a friend to truth, without a scadow of reason, in his Contrat Social, calumniate Grotius in so strange a manner? Had he not read the Law of Peace and War; or, had he forgotten what he had read ?

Hjbbes, however, in England, supporting another system, was not less useful to the science, both by the truths which he published, and by the refuta tions which he provoked against him. Algernon Sydney followed the opposite principles to those of Hobbes, in his Treatise on Government, and died a martyr to his attachment to the cause of the people. It is necessary to cease these citations, notwithstanding the importance of similar works; and although I might still bring forward such names as Conring, Forstner, Locke, Leibnitz, Wolff, Thomafusi Jurieu, Burlamaqui, Vaiel, Bolingbroke, and so many others more modern, in the north of Europe and in America, this may suffice to scow how greatly the moral impulse given by the reformation has influenced the progress made in the science of legislation, formerly plunged in a scholastic barbarism, equal to that which pre vailed in theology. But though we may, with justice, attribute this influence on the minds of Europeans, to the reformation, we must guard against the belief that it was an exclusive cause, confining its effects to those countries alone in which the reformation has become dominant. Italy has had its Machiavel, Spain its Mariana, * The book of Puffendorf, like that of Grotius, was put into the Index, and prohibited in certain Catholic countries, at Rome, in Austria, Spain, &c."], [253, "223 France its Bodin (suspected, it is true, of being secretly the partisan of the reform.) The ardour of these studies was also increased by the polemical disputes which took place between the different parties.

Would Montesquieu have become so much the pride of our political literature, if he had not had so many laborious predecessors to smooth his path ? From all these facts it is not difficult to deduce this evident truth; that the reformation, which from its birth was so intimately in contact with politics, and with every object of public utility, must have directed the minds of men to the. sciences connected with the economy and the ad ministration of states. Men, on the contrary, who, in their own coun try, lived under the co.ntinual influence ofa foreign authority ; who saw around them a powerful se- cular and regular clergy, in the possession of the finest domains ; in addition to this, raising tithes, the most unincumbered produce ofthe labours ofthe cultivator; these men became incapableof any gene rous effect : the interest they took in the culture ofthe soil was without energy. Besides, the mem bers of this clergy were the pastors-, the founders, the depositaries of all the knowledge, the masters ofall souls.

The true essence of a pedant is to be an enemy to reason, and to liberal inquiry in the sciences ; to have a flavisc belief in the authority of some other person, and, in his turn, to put in a despotic claim to make his own arbi trarily valid. If such is, in fact, a pedant, it will be acknowledged that the learned Protestants can have little title to the appellation; they, whose principal maxim is inquiry, the free use of his own reason to every reasonable being, and a libe ration from all authority.

Some only see in it the tempestuous fluctuations of a boundless ocean ; a blind and endless series of crimes, absurdities, and barbarisms; some fortunate moments suc- ceeded by terrible relapses ; chance dictating its pauses, necessity executing them, and cruscing with its iron hand the successive generations which it plunges into the gulf of oblivion. Others, of a more consolatory opinion, see, in the pro gressive course of the human race, a conducting Providence, an approach towards a better state, towards a civil and moral perfection. There are many Protestants who abide by the latter opinion, and endeavour to demonstrate its certainty. Those who think that a more reasonable and a more happy state has, through the influence of the reformation, been the consequence of a cora-"], [264, "234 motion so terrible, so universal, and so long, in Europe, must be permitted to give credit to this sublime conception of the perfectibility of our species, Perhaps those who are of a contrary opinion owe it to being placed in contrary cir cumstances, or else to some individual disposition, which does not allow them to suppose any pos sible perfection in their fellow-creatures. With Respect to the Mathematical and Physi- cal Sciences. At the first glance it appears that the reforma tion, the immediate impulse of which would be very perceptible in the study of the historical and philosophical sciences, could not, on the con trary, exercise any direct influence on that of the methodical and natural sciences. But if it be con sidered that a redoubled activity, an investigating disposition, implanted in the human mind by some great event, cannot remain inactive on any thing within its scope, conviction will soon follow that the study of these sciences must also have been advantageously affected by the moral im pulse given by the reformation. To this pre sumption, indicated by the nature of things, may also be joined this historical and local consi deration, that, at the moment when Luther ef fected the reformation of the theological system at Wittemberg, at sixty miles from it, in another city of the north, Copernicus prepared that of the"], [265, "235 astronomical system. These two revolutions being effected by two cotemporaries, it is not easy to discover, with precision, how much the one promoted the other, what have been the re sults of their combination, nor what are the effects which belong strictly to each of them. For this it would have been necessary to have penetrated into the recesses of all thoughts, and to have fol lowed the most hidden steps of the progress of the human mind, of which, at present, few traces and memorials remain. We may, however, ob serve, as we did at the commencement of this se cond part, that sceltered by the \u00c6gis ofthe reform, the Galileans were, at the least, freed from the dread of chains, and from the disgrace of recanta tions. It was under the protection of this \u00c6gis that Kepler completed the work of Copernicus, and gave geometrical certainty to the new system, which, probably in the eyes of its author, rested on a conviction purely logical. It is also re markable, whatever may have been the cause, that the two inventors of the differential calculation Liebnitz and Newton, lived, the one in Protest tant Germany, and the other in England. The Catholic countries, as well as the Protestant, have since had an equal number of great mathematicians and great philosophers. It is, however, just to suppose that the superior guidance of study and the greater freedom of investigation, are among the causes which have contributed most powerfully to make these beautiful branches of the tree of"], [266, "236 human knowledge flourish.* But above all, it is certain that the philosophical spirit, fomented, as has been shown, by the reformation, exercised its influence in a very marked manner on the study of mathematics and physics. It was not enough to extend and perfectionate these sciences in themselves, it was also wisced to- unveil the sub lime theory, to scrutinize their foundations, and six their bases : scientific men of the Protestant persuasion attached themselves more to these species of investigation than those of Catholic countries, who do not seem to have set so high a value on therm's\" The philosophy of nature, a science distinct from that called general physics, also acquired a con sistence and developments which make it one of of the most sublime branches of knowledge of which the genius of man can boast. It is to Kant also that it is indebted for its renovation and its principal bases. The intrepid Schelling has enriched it with the most sublime ideas. The system of Brown, which is only an organized philosophy of nature originated in Scotland; * See the dissertation of Wucherer on this subject; De incrementis physices u Reformationis tempore. + It wai Kant who first established the principles ofa the ory of mathematical certainty, and the evidence which is ad mitted in metaphysics, on occasion of the question proposed! en this subject, in 1771, by the Academy of Berlin."], [267, "237 has been Cultivated and developed in Germany \u00ab and is despised in France, where it is hitherto only imperfectly known. With respect to the military science, which is usually treated as an appendix to the mathema tical sciences, the north of Germany seems, in modern times, to have been destined to furnisc it with its principal additions. The infant state of tactics before the thirty years' war is known, Gustavus Adolphus was its reformer, and under him, this art acquired a new aspect in the fields of Saxony and Bohemia, On this fame soil, Frederick II. King of Prussia, nearly a century later, also contending against the fame house of Austria, which had been humbled by the Swedisc hero, completed the work of Gustavus Adolphus, and brought modern tactics to a degree of per fection, at which it will no doubt remain for the future, as far as regards its essential elements. With Res pest to the Belles- Lettres, and to modem Languages. Since the reformation redoubled the ardour for a knowledge of the ancient languages, the study of which it rendered more necessary and more general, as well among the Catholics as among the Protestants, it cannot be denied that it contri buted greatly to the culture of the belles-lettres, and to the restoration of a good taste. In propor tion as the classic works of antiquity, those eter nal models ofthe beautiful ; genuine and sublime"], [268, "238 as nature, were more dispersed and read, men'8 minds were gradually elevated to their pitch, and scook off the barbarism of the Gothic age\u00ab.* This revolution had been commenced in Italy by the Greek refugees, who had fixed themselves there in particular. The reformation assisted in pro pagating its benefits to the European nations far thest distant from this focus. Nevertheless, a language in which they might give vent to their ideas, a flexible and living or- gan, by which they might express their living conceptions, was necessary to those, in whom the spark of ancient genius had kindled an enthu- siasm. The modern idioms were in the uncul- tivated, rude state in which long want of use had plunged them. In the south alone, the Italian, and, perhaps, the Provencal, its ally, had assumed a purer form. In the rest of Europe they wrote in Latin ; Latin was the language of the schools and of books : and what Latin ! a jargon bear- ing all the blemisces of eleven centuries of cor- ruption and bad taste. Although the reading of Cicero, and the other masters of good Latin might have ameliorated and purified this jargon, whether good or bad, as in fact it did, this Latin was only the language ofa very small number of in- dividuals, and remained a dead letter to the \u2022 See Stock's work, entitled, De bonarum litter arum Palm* genesid, sub et post Reformationem.. See also Morhoff, &c."], [269, "239 people. Now the higher sciences may, with out inconvenience, be well expressed in the lan guage of the adepts ; the learned might treat on subjects in Latin, which only the learned were to read; in this manner mathematics, physics, philosophy, might be tolerably cultivated. But how could they have a literature, without a vul gar tongue, without a people, or, as it may be laid, without a public ? Every one has a right to decide on productions of taste and sentiment : the auditory of a wit or a poet cannot be restrained to Latin scholars : he requires all classes, all ages, all sexes ; he must speak the language of courts and of taverns, of closets and camps, of citizens and peasants; his business is with all minds, all hearts, and more particularly those most ingenu ous, most open to all impressions, with those who know least of Latin. While Vanierc can scarcely number a hundred readers, Delille will find thousands. In order, therefore, that each nation might have a literature, it was necessary to write in its language; it was necessary that all classes scould be accustomed to read ; a great event, a powerful interest, a subject which scould become the favourite topic of every one, which scould agitate all minds, which scould find access every where, was wanted: then alone would authors be found willing to write for the people, and a people who would read their writings with eager ness. The reformation was such an event, and"], [270, "240 became the active source of a general and inex haustible interest to all classes. The reformation, conceived by men of learn ing, and brought forth within the narrow bound ary of a Latin-speaking public, could never have been consummated, if it had remained within these limits. It was requisite that it should quit them, that it scould become the cause of the multitude, that it scould gain millions of heads, to arm millions of hands in its fa vour. An appeal to the people was the first step of the reformers, and this must necessarily be made in their language. When once the people were, in this manner, called upon and made judges, the opponents of the reform were also compelled to appear and plead at this tribu nal, and were not sparing in their efforts to re-. tain or bring back the multitude to rheir side.1 This controversy, which had left the schools, and become the great business of the whole of Eu rope, was the first active principle by which mo dern languages were really fertilized. Before, they were only jargons, as rude as the vulgar who made use of them. A few amorous sonnets were not enough to give them that richness and flex ibility which they required, to become capable of treating on all descriptions of subjects. The universal animosity between the papists and the reformists; the long troubles of Germany and Switzerland; those ofthe league in France; thosi;"], [271, "241 os (he Low Countries ; those of Scotland and England, became so many furnaces in which the different languages of these countries were ela borated and purified. In his Histoire de I' Esprit Humain* the Marquis D'Argens, after having described the state of letters previous to the six teenth century, fays, \" In these times of ignorance Luther appeared, like one of those cheering lights, which after a long tempest, announces to mari ners an approaching calm. This great man did as much good to science, as he did injury to the court of Rome- He scowed the absurdity of the errors which long respect and ancient custom had rendered sacred : he not only ridiculed the opinions of the theologians, but their language and their manner of writing. He was seconded in his undertakings by Calvin, and it is to these dis putes on religion that we are indebted for the res toration of the fine and good style. The theolo gians of the different parties eagerly strove with each other to write correctly, and to prejudice their readers by the purity of their style.\" The German nation acknowledges Luther for the reformer of its literature and its idiom. One of his first cares was to publisc a faithful transla tion of the Bible in the vulgar tongue, executed by him and some of his co-operators, from the original. It may be conceived with what avidity * Tom. 1. p. 258. R"], [272, "242 this immense work was received, and what a general sensation it excited. It is still taken as authority, and is the principal classic foundation of what is called high German. In this idiom he wrote the greater part of his treatises, letters, dis- courses, and poems, the collection of which forms twenty-two quarto volumes. One of his first writings was that entitled, Of the Christian Liberty, at the head of which he placed an epistle dedica- tory, as decent as open and liberal, to Pope Leo X. \" No writer for many ages (fays M. Georges Muller, of Schasthausen, in his Lettres fur les Sciences,) had seen his writings bought up with such avidity, and so universally read from the throne to the cottage. They were all re-printed several times, pirated, hawked over all the em- pire. The popularity, the natural ease, the ener- gy of expression which prevailed in them, a doc- trine which cheered and elevated the soul, gained him the most upright and judicious of all classes. A multiplicity of pamphlets, loose sceets, songs, which have reached us from that period, testify the universal extacy which this vivifying light in spired.\" Wickliff had previously translated the New Testament into Englisc : as soon as the re formation had rendered the reading of the sacred books of the first necessity to the people of En gland, Tindal, Roye * and others publisced a ver- * This is probably intended for Rogers, who, in conjunction with Coierdale, revised Tindal'i translation, and added the"], [273, "243 sion of them. The same thing occurred in France, where the reformation multiplied the French Bi bles, and placed them in the hands of every one.* When the Catholic theologians saw these great mysteries of religion become the prey ofthe igno rant, they resolved to countermine them, and to publisc also their translations, their commentaries, their explanations of the sacred books. We shall content ourselves with observing, generally, that the European languages were perfectionated by these religious and political controversies, by these trans lations and explanations, which is sufficient to the object in discussion, f prefaces and notes from Luther's Bible. This translation was dedicated to Henry VIII. in the feigned name of Thomas Mat thews, aud is known by the name of Matthews's Bible. T. * It is true that in his Histoire Critique du \u25a0 vieux Testament, p. 332, Father Simon asserts that the first French Bible was that of .\\nvers, of 1530, revised by the theologians of Lou vain, and that thus \" it was the Catholics who were the first authors of the French Bibles read at present.\" But Father Simon did not know that that Bible was the work of Jacques Lefebvre of Estaples, commonly called Faber Stapulensis the confidant of the Queen of Navarre, suspected with good reason of being a partisan of Luther, declared to be a heretic by the Sorbonne, and deprived of his doctorate. This trans lation ofthe Bible was also used as the basis of that of Ge- neva. + We must not omit here the real services rendered by Bayle to the French language, which he contributed greatly to the production ofa taste for, which he made capable of being modelled to ev&ty subject, and even of treating on mat ters which before had only been treated of in Latin. R 2"], [274, "244 It would, doubtless, be hazarding too much, to* fay more ofthe influence exerted on the belles-let tres, by the reformation. * So many different causes have contributed to their culture, and to the different modifications they have experienced, in the various European nations, that whoever en ters this labyrinth will be in danger of missing his track, of blending objects, and of giving ingenious conjectures instead of certain results. The Protest ant nations, which may be called the Germanic race, have such a similarity of features among them, in their manners, language, and climate, that we must be careful of taking a conformity in the characters or genius of their literary produc tions, for the immediate effects of the great revo lution which was common to them. The spirit of each people, so powerfully modified by such a number of events, and of generations, has its own tendencies, its natural dispositions, which cannot be attributed to one insulated circumstance. With out doubt, the unanimity with which the Protest ant nations of the present day adopted the reform * Nevertheless it may also be added, that the inhabitants of the towns and the country, who hear divine service regularly in their own tongue, who sing psalms, canticles, and rich pieces of poetry in it, written, as they are in Germany, by the best national poets, acquire, by that means, a crowd of ideas, a taste and a notion of the beautiful, which can never be attained by those who assist at a service, performed in bad Latin, which they do not understand."], [275, "245 as soon as it presented itself, was only a result of this mutual conformity of their spirit. Their progress in this respect (the matter being adopted in general) has always tended to simplify religion, to render it more strict and more intellectual, re maining inviolably attached to deism, and to that morality which is the basis of it. The manners of the Protestant are also incontestably better and more grave, than those ofthe Catholic nations. Is it because these nations are Protestant, that they have acquired this character ; or, is it because they have this character that they became Protestant ? I must leave the decision of this question to others. I am only desirous of scowing the influence of this character on the culture ofthe belles-lettres. The French and Italian literature is rich in a multi tude of works, in which love is treated with the most exquisite delicacy and grace : such a number of these agreeable productions would be sought for in vain, among the Englisc or Germans ; I might even dare to assert, that the few they have are mere ly imitative, and that they are not indigenous plants in their soil. Among them, love would not dare to appear escorted by the desires, and as sociated with voluptuousness. Their Bocaces, Gre courts, and Lafontaines, have not yet been born. Should they appear, they would be coldly re ceived ; and it was not by the softened imitations of this description, which Wieland hazarded, that he conciliated the most ofthe esteem of his coun- trymen. In a word, their songs, their romances, 6"], [276, "246 the ideal world of their poets, are totally different from what is seen among their neighbours. I dare not give this as a consequence of the reformation, but rather as a coincidence. It is, however, very deserving of notice, that the two most sublime epic poemsj in which the God of Christians, and the inhabitants of heaven are the actors, and in w7hich these actors speak a language worthy of them ; the two most wonderful pictures of celestial innocence and virtue, that ofthe fall of the first human beings, and chat of their redemption, are Protestant productions. If the too-scort golden age of Italian poetry had not produced the Jeru salem of Tasfo, Paradise Lost and the Messiah would have been the only two epic poems of which mo- dern literature could have boasted. Finally, the investigating and reasoning spirit, to which the reformation opened a free career, as has been shown above, was also introduced into the domain of the imagination, and took such a post in it as it was capable of, that is to fay, it took refuge in the theoretic department of , the belles letters, in the systems connected with sentiment, taste, the beautiful and sublime, Sec. It is known, that in proportion, the Protestant literati have done more on these subjects, and per haps, have penetrated more deeply into them, than the others. It is among them that the rational part of literary criticism has assumed the form of a science, under the name of Esthetics. This name was given to it hy Baumgarten, a German, from a"], [277, "247 Greek word signifying sentiment. Lessing, as well as Sulzer and his followers, have publisced some valuable pieces of this description. Kant has founded a new esthetic school, in his Criticism on the Judgment. He has had numerous and ingenious disciples ; the most remarkable among them, both in theory and in practice, is the illustrious Schil ler. With Respect to the Fine Arts. It is when a pompous worscip requires magni ficent temples, imposing ceremonies, and a striking appearance ; it is when religion exhibits the sensi ble images of the objects of public veneration, when it rests on a sacred mythology ; when the earth and the heavens are peopled with superna tural beings, to whom the imagination can lend a form,- it is then, I fay, that the arts, encouraged, ennobled, reach the summit of their splendour and their perfection. The architect, called to honours and wealth, conceives the plan of these basilicks, these cathedrals, the appearance of which inspires a religious awe; of which the rich walls are decorated with the master-pieces of art. This temple, these altars are adorned with marble and the precious metals, out of which-sculpture has formed angels, the blessed, and images of illustrious men. The choirs, the galleries, the chapels, the sacristies, are decorated with pictures hung in all parts. Here, Jesus dies on the cross ; there he appears on Tabor,"], [278, "248 in all the resplendence of Divine Majesty. Art, so much the friend of the imagination, which can find gratification only in the heavens, goes there in search of its most sublime creations ; a St. John, a Cecilia, and more particularly, a Mary, that pa troness ofall tender and ardent minds, that virgin model ofall mothers, the mediatrix of mercy be tween man and his God, the august and touching Elysian being, of which no other religion offers a resemblance or a model. During the solemnities, thechoicest stuffs, precious stones, and embroidery cover the altars, the vessels, the priests and even the partitions of the holy place. By the most exquisite songs, by the harmony of orchestras, music completes the charm. These encourage ments, of such powerful efficacy, are renewed in a hundred different places : the metropolises, the parisces, the numerous convents, the simple ora tories, vie in splendor, and captivate all the powers ofthe religious and devout soul. Thus the taste for the arts, assisted by such a powerful lever, be comes general ; artists are multiplied, and rival each other in their efforts. Through this influ ence, the celebrated schools of Italy and Flanders liourisced, and those most beautiful productions of them which remain to us, testify the richness ofthe encouragement lavisced on them by the Catholic worscip. From the natural course of things, it cannot be doubted that the reformation was unfavourable to the fine arts, and laid a considerable restraint upon the exercise of them. It broke the bond"], [279, "249 which united them to religion, which rendered them sacred, and secured them a scare in the veneration of the people. The liturgy of the Lutherans, and still more that of the Calvinists, is simple and strict. A stone, a cloth, form the altar ; a pulpit and benches are all the decora tion necessary to the temple. Here nothing is thought of but the gospel, and some divine songs on morality and the Christian duties, fung by the congregation. All is devoid of orna ment, pomp, and elegance. The priest is cloth ed in a modest black garment ; no veneration of a faint or an angel, and still less of their images, is recommended to pious souls. It might be said that this worscip is melancholy and dry, in comparison with that of the Ca tholics, if, however, an assembly of persons collected to worscip in common, can really corres pond with the idea of melancholy. Nevertheless it is certain, that this worscip which can elevate the soul, tends to disenchant the imagination ; it renders'superb churches, and statues, and paintings fuperflous ; it depopulates the arts, and deprives them of one of their most powerful resources. Besides this general disposition peculiar to a worscip which keeps so rigidly close to the pure spirit of the primitive church, and which does not admit of any coquetry with the senses, the particular disposition of the nations which have embraced the reform must be considered. The greater part of them inhabit the severest climate"], [280, "250 of Europe. They are colder, more phlegmatic, more thoughtful than those of the south : they have not nature before their eyes in so beautiful a form ; they do not respire that voluptuous, soft, intoxicating air of the Italia atmosphere. Independent ofthe reformation, therefore, they are not so well placed, so well constituted for the practice of the arts, as the Italians for ex ample. Without doubt they have had, and still have, esteemed artists, but not such as to excel those of Italy, or even to counterbalance them. Their real merit in the arts, and which arises from their reflecting, scrutinizing spirit, is that of treating the theory with more penetration ; of observing and investigating the principles which, unknown to them, direct the great artists ; of tracing the course of the imagination, and the understanding in their productions ; of discover ing the connections between the ideal nature of the arts, and real nature: in a word, of deve loping the principles and philosophy of the arts. The Italian feels and produces : Hewsterhtiys, Kant, Burke, Goethe, think, analyze the produc tion, and the faculty of producing. The one has the instinct of art ; the other, the intelligence. The one creates ; the other judges of the crea tion, and calculates its laws. These two func tions equally presuppose genius. The first dis plays it externally, in visible forms ; the second, in the depths of the understanding. This may be named the legislative power; that, the execu tive power of the fine arts."], [281, "r 251 SECT. II. Results of the Events which have accompanied andfolloxced the Reformation. TROUBLES AXD WARS IN THE POLITICAL \"WORLD. CONTRO- TERSIES IN THE THEOLOGICAL WOULD. JIf the reformation had only affected doctrine, and Luther had only attacked transcbstantiation, or pardons, such an obscure quarrel would have remained in the schools, and scarcely have ob- tained the honours ofa bull of condemnation. The Holy Father, would, unconcernedly, have treated the new heretic like a thousand others who have passed by without creating an epocha. The na- tions and the princes would have been wholly ignorant of a quarrel which was not theirs. But Luther not only attacked the spirit, or the doc- trine of popery ; he from the first, struck at the most sensible part of the temporals of the church, and began the heresy with the apostolical fi- nances. From thenceforward no one could remain indifferent : those who raised the tribute made a great outcry ; those who were freed from the pay- ment of it, declared strenuously for the innovators. The most powerful ofthe Christian princes, how- ever, those who threatened the independence of all the others, thought proper to support the rights of Rome. The others, who, in this con juncture saw the double opportunity of freeing"], [282, "252 themselves at the fame time, from the papal des potism, and from the yoke of Austria, resolved to arm in defence of the reform, and suffered themselves to be carried down the torrent with their people. Hence also resulted this double misfortune, that the wars which arose, took a religious and a fanatic character; consequently, more animated, more dreadful, and more san guinary than that of other wars ; and that the controversies of the theologians acquired apoli tical importance, a universality which rendered their effects more fatal, more durable, and more extensive than those of all the numerous contro versies which had, at any former time, agitated the Christian church. These were the sources of the evils, of the horrible catastrophes, which accompanied and followed the reformation ; such were the causes ofacentury and a half of a mortal crisis, of san guinary, wars, of revolts, and of troubles in Europe. A spark which Luther had struck to light a torch, fell among heaps of powder, in a country wholly mined. The explosion scook all the west, and seemed likely to bring back the night of bar barism which had been begun to be dissipated : but fortunately the torch had been lighted ; and when the clouds of vapour emitted from the vol cano began to disperse, its beneficent light scone like a star which had been darkened by a tempest, but, on the return of serenity, serves to restore the pilot to his course."], [283, "253 It may, therefore, be truly said, with some of the opponents of the reformation, that, at the moment, it forced the reign of knowledge and the culture of the sciences to retrograde. Let us figure to ourselves the unheard-of devastations to which unfortunate Germany became a prey : the war of the peasants in Suabia ; that of the Ana baptists of Munster; that of the league of Smalcald against Charles V.; finally, that dread ful one which lasted until the treaty of West phalia, and also after this treaty, until its com plete execution. The empire was changed by it into a vast cemetery, in which two generations were swallowed up, where cities were only smoking ruins, and heaps of asces ; the schools deserted and without masters ; agriculture destroyed ; ma nufactures burnt. To this may be added, that, on this desolated land, men's minds were soured, disunited, exasperated by their long divisions: Catholics, Lutherans, Calvinists, Anabaptists, Mo ravians, all accused and attributed to each other the lamentable wounds of their common country, of that country which was not only torn by its own children, but so long exposed to the troops of Spain and Italy, to the fanatics of Bohemia, to hordes of Turks, to the French, Swedisc, and Da nisc armies, who vied with each other in bringing into it the carnage and desolations of a war, such as was carried on in the seventeenth century, and which had the characters of a civil and religious war. A country requires a very long space of"], [284, "254 time to recover from such a commotion and so deep a rain. Consequently we see the German nation, after having, at first, made very great strides in the sciences, during the peace which Was maintained while Luther lived, fall, for a part of the seventeenth century, into a sort of stupor, into an almost total want of culture. In this pe- riod, its literature remained behind that, of the Italians, the French, and the Englisc ; and, from thence may be dated the unfavourable prejudice against German talents, which is not yet wholly cxtinguisced in the latter nations. Since this pe- riod the aspect of things has been greatly changed; but prejudices last longer than things ; and the love of our own country, strengthened by a habit disposed to believe, and an indolence which checks examination, will, perhaps render this opinion very difficult to destroy. It was not on its native soil alone, where its cause was contested with such inveteracy, that the refor- mation occasioned hesc destructive convulsions. France could not escape them ; but the troubles of this country were neither so long nor so mischievous as those of Germany. The latter country was inthe most deplorable state, when France had healed all her wounds, under Sully, Richelieu, and Mazarine, and had attained the summit of her literary and political glory. The Low Countries were the theatre of the convulsive struggle of Spain against the new Dutch republic. The evils resulting from it to this part of Europe, nearly equalled those of"], [285, "255 the rest of the empire. Finally, England became the prey of intestine commotions, which have been detailed above, in the article appropriated to that power. It is enough to be obliged to acknow ledge that, since the irruption of the northern tribes into the Roman empire, no event had pro voked such long and such universal ravages in Europe, as the war kindled in the furnace ofthe reformation. In this point of view, it is too true that it retarded the progress of the general culture: but when the conflagration was at an end, all the solid benefits derived from it appeared, in the bet ter direction, the new activity, the liberty, it had given to the human mind, in the immense obsta cles it had removed from its path, and which so invincibly scackled its progress. I ask, besides, was it the reformation which called the princes and the nations to the combat ? In its principle, the reformation was only the act by which reason declared itself emancipated, and freed from the yoke ofarbitrary authority ; an eman cipation which was the natural and unavoidable consequence of the renovation of knowledge. Its object was to restore the Gospel to Christians in its purity, to renounce the exorbitant claims of the popes. The adversaries of this reform were so en raged, so iniquitous, as to wisc to stifle it in the blood of its sectaries. They alone are guilty of all the evils which followed. The terrible efforts made to annihilate the reform prove, to every re flecting mind, its great necessity. 5"], [286, "256 A more direct reproach, and apparently a more just one, which may be brought against the reformation, is that of having rekindled, with in conceivable fury, the theological disputes, which interested all minds, were introduced into all places, and consumed so much knowledge, talents, assiduity, and erudition, as were lavisced in feeding their fire. The attention of the learned world was directed for upwards ofa century to these calami tous, quarrels of dogmas and forms, which became a new and powerful obstacle to the progress of the sciences. They strengthened the disposition for reveries and the extravagant mysticism of some ardent imaginations. Polemical disputations na turally'arose.from the first,between the theologians of Rome and those of the reform : they were violent on both sides, and accompanied by contumely and insults.* The acrimony, too natural to such dis- * Luther is greatly reproached, and by Voltaire among others, for some invectives and contemptuous terms which he used against the Pope. Voltaire has employed much more indecent language himself, and with less reason, against his opponents. At the beginning, Luther showed himself very submissive and very respectful to the head ofthe church. He expressed himself at first, and also frequently afterwards, with great moderation and decency. But let us reflect on the hor rible abuse with which he was loaded; let us read the libels of Hochttrateny Eckius, Tetzel, &c. and we shall see whether Luther ought to be condemned for the anger and indignation he occasionally manifested. If he had not been ardent and irritabse, how could behave become the leader of so great a"], [287, "257 (^ cussions and such circumstances, was propagated from year to year, and from controversy to con troversy, and contributed greatly to giving the literary disputes of the times that followed, that strain of animosity which is more observable in this than in any other age. It was not between the Catholics and the innova tors alone that the combat raged ; but very ardent revolution? If his enemies had had him in their power, they would have burned him as they did John Huss. For his part, he was satisfied with turning them into ridicule, but he did not burn any one. Against adversaries who employ tortures and -sire, is it an offence so heinous to employ sarcasms even though they should be in a bad taste ? There was very little good taste in the sixteenth century. Besides, leisure and tranquillity are necessary to taste; and could leisure be allied with the clashing of all interests, and all passions ? The language of Luther, sometimes violent, was never cruel and ferocious, like that of some of the popes. Clement VI. in the bull of anathema which he issued against the Emperor Louis of Bavaria, expresses himself thus : \u25a0' May God strike him with imbecility and mad- ness; may heaven overwhelm him with its thunders ; may the angerof God, with that of St. Peter and St. Paul, fall upon him in this world and in the next ; may the whole universe revolt against him ; may the earth swallow him up alive ; may his name perilh from the earliest generation; and may his memory disappear; may all the elements be adverse to him ; may his children, delivered into the hands of his enemies, be crushed before the eyes of their father, &c.\" (Rainaldi, Ann. Eccles.) Such language did not prevent Petrarch, playing on the name of this pope, from saying that he was clemency itself; while Garasse and all his worthy successors delight in repeating that Luther was a clownish monk, a hot-headed heresiarch,znd other pitiful things. Strange blindness of ignorance and fanaticism ! s"], [288, "258 contests soon arose in the bosom ofthe reform itself, and between its partisans. I cannot here relate the history of all the sects and all the opinions which the unlimited liberty established by the reform gave rise to, in such numbers. These sects, all enemies of Rome, did not treat each other better than they treated the Papists. Besides the fanatic brotherhoods of Anabaptists, Mennonites, Adam ites, Muntzerians, Puritans, &c. ; besides the violent contests on the doctrine of the sacraments, which Luther, Melanclbon, and others had to support against Carlstadt, \u0152colampadius, &c. there arose important schisms in the evangelicalthurch, which were also allied to politics, and were not without influence on the fate ofthe people. The Swiss reform declared itself against the Saxon re form, and the Englisc church was establisced independent of both. The struggle between Lutheranism and Calvinism was violent and long.\" * If I have not taken greater notice of the schism between the Lutherans and Calvinists, itis because 1 had not to give an account of the influence of the reform on the religious doctrine and belief. There have been few results of this schism of any importance to the states, because the Calvinists have obtained the fame rights as the Lutherans in the empire. It has only produced some misunderstandings ai'd internal dis sensions in the evangelical party; to which ,t has, for that reason, been hurtful. The electoral houses of Saxony and the Palatinate, among others, have had severe contelts on this subject ; but I cannot speak of them : my only object has been to give results of importance to the rest ol Europe ; these domestic bickerings ofthe reform are not of that description."], [289, "259 So many vain disputes could not take place but at the expense of beneficial studies and useful know ledge, the culture of which was neglected on ac count of them. This does not contradict what I have said above of the happy results of the moral impulse given by the reformation . I have given these results such as they really were in the end, and without confining myself to the order of time. It is thus that what may appear contradictory in that which I have formerly said, in favour, and that which I now say to the disadvantage ofthe reform, is to be understood and interpreted. We may observe, however, that these religious disputes, which related only to the different opi nions on theology and matters of faith, have contributed to keep up that living spirit of religion, and that attachment to Christianity in the Protest ant countries,which is much less visible in Catholic countries. After all, it is better to dispute on reli gion than to agree quietly not to have any \u2022 tocon tend on the manner of adoring God, than not to believe in him at all, and to remain indifferent and lukewarm on what relates to our connection with the Divinity. It is also better, without doubt, to adore God sincerely, and to leave each in dividual at liberty to perform this high action in his own manner. This is precisely what, some sooner, and others later, the different reformed na tions have come to. They began with wrangling ' and controversy ; they finisced with philosophy 8 a"], [290, "260 and toleration ; and the spirit of religion remained with them.* We may also observe, that this theological in quietude, which has produced so many useless and even injurious controversies among the reformists, was not in any respect essential to the reformation, but belonged to the age, and to Christianity in general. The first reformers were Catholic theo logians, trained inthe bosom of the Roman church, and had communicated a captious irritability to their new doctrine. It was not because they were Lutherans or Calvinists that these new doctors were full of subtleties, were vain and petulant ; it was because they had been Catholics, and were compelled to defend themselves without remission against the Catholic doctors. This spirit of dis putation was, as we may suppose, transmitted to their immediate successors ; but it was at length subdued and overpowered by the true spirit of the reform, which is the fame as that of the gospel, and by that of knowledge and philosophy, so powerfully seconded by the reform, which are not different from those of humanity and toleration. Abelard and St. Bernard were not reformists ; neither were the two parties ofthe Franciscans, in * The religious discussions had also some other good effects, from the favourable disposition to philosophical and specu lative subjects which they kept up in men's minds.

To what a deluge of controversies and scholastic barbarisms did these two give rise ! Since the time of the apostles, the Christian church has been constantly afflicted with this mania of sects, and debates on doctrine. From Simon the magician, Cerinthus and Ebbion to Janfenius, Quefnel, and the last days of the Sorbonne, nothing has been seen but disputes, the acrimony of parties, hatreds, condemnations. How could a sudden revolution be effected in this church, without bearing the fame characters ? How could such a volcano break out without discharging torrents of lava ? Poor human reason had been so long captive in the schools of theology, that, at first, it was unable to make the most proper use of its liberty. A prisoner whose chains are struck off, the door of whose dungeon is thrown open, quits it with unsteady steps ; his benumbed feet are unable to support him ; the blaze of day, destined to enlighten him, makes him blind ; he wanders about at hazard, strikes against every ob stacle, falls, and destroys himself. \u2014 Would it have been better, for this reason, to have left the opponents and disciples, equally ardent, in Holland ? Hol land was the true focus of Cartesianifm. It was there also that all those sheltered theologians, Saurin, Jurieu, Basnage, fas well as Beausobre, Lenfant and others at Berlin,) discussed and wrote, and whose books warmed the zeal of our Arnauld, Bossuet, and Nicole, in their answers, from which, as well as from the replies of their adversaries, we might select more than one master-piece, in works remarkable for the eloquence arising from a warmth of soul, for the beauty of style, and the erudition which is displayed in them."], [292, "262 man in his dungeon ? The opponents of the reform fay yes. Secret Societies ; Free-Masons ; Rosier ucians ; Mystics; Illuminati. When a certain number of individuals, forming a feeble minority ofa nation, feel themselves the depositaries of opinions which they believe to be of importance, and which they dare not make public, because they think them dangerous to the multitude, or because they would expose themselves to persecutions by professing them openly, or from any other cause: then arises to these indivi duals the necessity of secret unions, in which they may profess their doctrine with freedom \u2022, an intimate fraternity between all the members of the association, oaths not to betray it, tests, signs to know each other in the midst of strangers, are necessary to them. Hence the mysteries of Egypt. of Greece, those of Pythagoras, &c. There is no doubt that many of these mysteri ous fraternities have existed in Europe since the fall ofthe Roman empire, and that some of them may have passed through the middle age to reach us. But without attending to all the recitals, true or fabulous, which several of them give of their origin, and which frequently have no other foundation but a romantic tradition, deceitful sym bols, and suppositions monuments, we shall only stop to observe that the nature of things never made these societies so necessary and so mysterious as they were rendered by the abuses of the hierarchical"], [293, "263 despotism, the inquisition, and the vexations of every kind exercised by the agents of Rome in the period which preceded the reformation. There was a considerable number ofall classes whose eyes were opened to these abuses, and who perceived their enormity ; but they carefully concealed in their souls, a secret, which, had it been divulged, would have condemned them to the flames. It was only when they met a tried friend apart, that they could communicate their sentiments ; then their oppressed breasts were unburthened, they consoled each other, in a low voice, on the load with which they were borne down, and consulted on the means of uniting, and supporting them selves, and of forming a small circle w:ithin which the tyrants of the mind could Fnot reach them. It is more than probable that such societies existed at the time of the reformation. The Wickliffites in England and Scotland, the Hussites in Bohe mia, Silesia and Moravia, as well as the remains of the Albigenses in France, must, doubtless, have felt the want of a mutual communication, and also of a careful concealment ; two conditions which are principally instrumental in the formation of these societies. -How much more pressing and general must these circumstances have become, -when the reformation broke out openly in Saxony, and every where redoubled the activity and watch- fulness of the spies and inquisitors of Rome ? There was not any Catholic country in which the principles of Luther had not gained a great num- ber of partisans. The situation of these secret ad"], [294, "264 herents of the reform was exceedingly perilous. A simple suspicion would have undone them, would have given them over to puniscment. The extreme constraint they were under could only cease and receive some alleviation in the hidden conventicles ofthe most profound mystery. Jf the order of Free-Masons did not then take its rise, (that is to fay, towards the close of the six teenth, or beginning of the seventeenth centuryj, at least it received both new modifications and a new extension at that period. They have not yet found titles which are completely sceltered from criticism, or in which a formal mention of them is made, prior to the year 1610. The tem ple of Jerusalem, the strict filiation of the tem plars, belong probably to the mythology of this order, rather than to its history. There are an cient laws in existence which exclude the Catho lics, and confine the order to the Protestants alone. The principles of equality and fraternity between the members, are very conformable to that seen at that time in several open and avowed sects. The geographical position of Bohemia and Saxony, from whence issued the light of the reform, with respect to Scotland, England, and France, seems to explain the denomination of the East com monly used in their lodges. In the state of con, fusion and advancement of all nations, a confor mity of opinion was of more importance to them than a conformity of country.

The Scotch Puritan frater nized with the Engliscman of his sect, in despite ofthe national antipathy- Nevertheless the civil wars, those of nation against nation, long and san guinary, which followed, particularly in England and Scotland, often brought these brothers, these secret allies to blows, and exposed them to the mu tual danger of taking each other's lives. Each followed at random the colours under which his fortune had thrown him. How many soldiers, zealous Protestants at the bottom of their hearts, served in the imperial armies of Ferdinand, and in those of Philip 11. ! How many Calvinists in the army of the league, and prescyterians in the ranks of the epifcopals ! A mysterious sign was, therefore, required, by which brother might be revealed to brother in the midst ofthe confusion and carnage. It is known that the Free-Masons have one, destined to accomplisc this object ; and this alone seems evidently to prove that this order belongs to the sanguinary period of the wars of the seventeenth century, during which there are numerous examples of individuals being saved amidst the greatest perils, by their enemies them selves, who, by this sign, recognized them for fellows and brothers. The slate of disorder and fermentation in which the human mind was, in general, at the moment of Luther's appearance; the efforts which it made in various directions to arrive at the light,"], [296, "266 and escape from the darkness of the middle age, gave use to several coincident events in the reign of science, which were mingled in a thousand dif ferent ways, both with the ideas of the religious sects of this period, and with the mysterious doc trine of the secret societies. A fanciful assem blage of aphorisms, called of Hermes, Pythagoras, and Plato, adapted to the Hebrew text of the books of the old Testament, and of those of some Rabbis,.had renewed the Judaical reveries, known by the name of Cabbala. The sectaries of this ob scure doctrine, called also by them the hermetic, the pythagorean, etc. philosophy, expected to find in them the sources of knowledge, ot universal wisdom. Reuchlin, Zorzi and Agrippa gave it its consistence in the sixteenth century. Cardan and others added judicial astrology to it. The cele brated Swiss, Theophrastus Bombast de Hohenheim, better known by the name of Paracelfu s, united his knowledge to the cabbala, and aimed at pene trating all the secrets of God, or of nature, which to him was the fame thing. To find the primitive element, the great menstruum j to fix the light, and subject it to his operations ; in a word, to find the philosopher's stone3 to cure all diseases and to make gold, by its means, was the end, the great work of the new science, which its numer ous partisans sometimes called theofophy, the philosophy of fire, etc. Fie who, after Paracelsus, gained it the most popularity, was the celebrated Engliscman Robert Fludd. In the laboratories of this sect were propagated the Oriental ideas of"], [297, "267 magic, of apparitions, of genii ; ideas which pre vailed about this time, and have not yet entirely ceased. The common doctrine of the ground work ofall these cabbalists, astroIogers,and alche mists, was the pantheism of the school of Alexan dria ; and consequently, through all its variations, a sort of Platonifm, which, as such, would op pose, with all its powers, the famous Aristote lisin, defended by the scholastics, and the princi pal support of the Roman theology.* The Protest ant sects, the enemies of Rome, received, therefore, and gave credit to all these novelties, introduced, principally, in the secret associations of which we have spoken, and which sometimes were open to these magicians, blowers of gold, etc. The religious ideas of every description, from the most extravagant cabbala, to the most ra tional Protestantism ; the moral ideas of equality, of fraternity, and of beneficence among all men; those of judicial astrology, of theosophy and al- * It cannot be denied that these thcosophists, as well as the reformist theologians, prepared the way for Descartes, in the mortal war wliich he waged against the remains of the scholastic philosophy.

Ac cording as an individual or a lodge adopted more particularly one or other of these views, its doc trine tended more to religious mysticism, or to political mysticism, or to astrology, or to alchemy, or, etc. Gradually, however, the elements purely moral, were separated entirely from the mysteries of alchemy, and of the philosopher's stone. They took refuge in the society so well known by the name of Free-Masonry, which, whether its origin ascends higher than the reformation or not, re ceived a new growth and a new vigour from it. For a long time, since the religious troubles have been calmed in Europe, and all the christian sects are allowed in it, this estimable society has only retained some of the mysterious forms of its infancy, a secret which only seems to be pre served to render the association more connected or more enticing, and a great respect for the sacred books, which was the characteristic fea ture of Protestantism.

The most famous of these mystical theosophists was a scoemaker of Goerlitz in Lu satia, Jacob Bxhm, whose writings, being read with avidity, created him a multitude of sectaries over all the north of Europe ; there are also among them, some, very illustrious for their knowledge; I shall only instance the two Van Helmonts, father and son, of Brussels, and Peter Poiret, of Metz. At a period very near our own, we also reckon Swedenbourg, and all the sect of Martinists, among whom Paracelsus and B\u0153hm are likewise held in great esteem.

If, as Seneca fays, there is no great genius without some mixture of folly, perhaps, also, there is no great folly without some mix ture of genius. However this may be, these secret societies were not without some influence on the moral culture, and also on the events which have oc curred in Europe since the reformation. It was, therefore, to our purpose to notice the influence which this had on their existence. On these have been grafted and modelled some more recent associations, of which the best known is the ordei of the Illuminati, a general denomination which has served as a mask and a pretext to much knave ry. The purpose of the real Illuminati, as I be lieve, was no other than to propagate knowledge and to realize liberal ideas of the rights of nature, by founding a society of energetic and well meaning men, who might labour with all their united strength against a certain system of obscurantism which tended towards a return to barbarism, and which was efficaciously supported by some courts. The Illuminati, during the scort period of their existence, neglected no means to make their in tentions triumph, and to subject all the great men of the earth to them.

A century earlier, Loryla would probably only have sounded an order like many others, a fraternity of worscippers ofthe Virgin, for whom he had a great veneration. The religious innova tions which, at this time, menaced the existence ofthe Roman church, gave the enthusiasm of tne devout and warlike Ignatius, another direction ; he conceived the idea of a sort of spiritual crusade against heresy. After some doubts his plan was vigorously adopted at Rome, and they thought serioufly of this new society as of a formidable phalanx, which might be opposed to the most violent champions of the reform. It is, there fore, as has been already observed, to the reaction provoked by the latter, that the species of exist ence which the company of Jesus had, must be attributed.

The missions were, to them and the popes, what colonies are to civil governments, a source of riches and power. At length this militia of the Holy See gradually became formidable to their masters. They were suspected of harbouring a secret design to appropriate to themselves the universal monarchy they were intended to re conquer for the popes. From this arose discussi ons, in which the society, oftener than once, scow ed themselves intractable, and made it appear that it knew the value of its services. But let us re turn to the immediate object of this article, to the influence of the Jesuits on the progress of knowledge, It has been already said that they were intrust ed with the greater part of the public instruction, in the Catholic states. Europe had already tasted ofthe tree of knowledge; its light had spread into all parts, and had made a rapid progress ; it had become impossible to oppose it openly.

To well-informed ad versaries, therefore, they determined to oppose men as well informed: the crafty companions of Ignatius were appointed to satisfy the universal desire to acquire knowledge manifested by the age. It was here that the inconceivable talent of the new preceptors of humanity was displayed. Their leading maxim was to cultivate, and bring to the highest possible degree of perfection, every species of knowledge from which no immedi ate danger could arise to the system of the hierar chical power, and by that means to acquire the estimation and celebrity of being the most able and most learned men of the christian world. Assisted by this supremacy over opinion, it be came easy for them either to paralyze the branches of knowledge which might bear fruit danger ous to the papacy, or to bend, direct, and graft these branches at pleasure. Thus, in inspiring a taste for the liberal sciences, the Greek and Roman classics, profane history, mathematics, they could conveniently stifle that of inquiring into matters of religion and state, the philosophical and investigating spirit. The philosophy taught in their schools was calculated to make this science repulsive and disgusting. It was no other than the scholastic, revised and corrected by them and applied to circumstances, particularly to the po lemical controversy with the reformists, whole arguments, as may readily be supposed, were brought forward in them so as to be destroyed"], [307, "277 l>y the artillery of the school.

Their grand rallying word was the utility of the sciences, and the lustre of the belles-lettres. As to every thing relating to a moral amelioration or to the ennobling of mankind, as well as every thing connected with the philosophical and theo logical sciences, the Jesuits strove eagerly, and, in fact succeeded in making them be totally for gotten; in rendering theology and philosophy barbarous and full of difficulties, and even ridi culous, in the eyes ofthe bulk of mankind. Who can determine how much this Jesuitic mode of instruction, which became the reigning mode in the Catholic countries, and which differs so wide ly from the mode of instruction ofthe Protestants; how much, I fay, this procedure, obstinately sol- lowed during several successive generations, might have influenced the species of culture and particu lar turn of mind among the Catholics, so different, in general, from what is seen among the Protest ants?"], [308, "278 It, however, results from all this sand I believe this consideration is the key to the contradictory judgments formed on the method of the Jesuits, in the culture of the sciences,) that this society has rendered immense services to certain parts of lite- rature, on which it has thrown light ; but that, on the other hand, it has purposely kept certain other important parts in obscurity: or, it has so scattered the avenues with difficulties, that men were not tempted to engage in them ; so that, taken in general, the instruction given in their schools, very brilliant on the one side, remained very dark on the other, was a partial and incomplete instruction, and put the mind in a wrong track ; for, as on the one side, all was clear and bright, and, on the other, all was dark and mysterious, the eye naturally turned* to that side which alone was luminous, and disdained to rest on the other, of which they were even habituated not to suspect the existence.

As nothing can be more fatal to the liberty ofa people thana despotism which can render itself amiable and plausible, neither is any thing more capable ps vitiating the minds of men radically, than the knowledge of the art of rendering falscood, truth; and irrationality, reasonable. It may be conceived how much the universal employment and the pretensions of the Jesuits must have excited envy and ill-will in all classes !\u2022 See what the celebrated Arnaud wrote on (his occasion. under the title of La Noimelle heretic des Jesuitcs."], [311, "281 They wisced to be the preachers, the theologians, the supporters ofthe Holy See ; and they came in collision with the Dominicans, and almost all the other religious orders : they aspired to the direc tion of consciences, particularly those of princes, and ofall those who had any influence on the po litics of courts; and they inflamed the hatred of courtiers and ministers : they sought to be masters of all the institutions for education and public in struction ; and they irritated against them the an cient universities, the masters and professors ofall the schools which they did not succeed in bringing under their domination. Neither is it to be doubt ed that the powerful rivalry of the Jesuits, the erection of their nevy schools, their methods, their writings, and still more their silent machinations, were the secret poison which, from that time, af- fected the universities of France, which caused them to languisc, decay, and finally fall into a nullity which places them far below those of Pro testant countries. The most formidable enemies which the Jesuits prude, and those most capable of opposing them, were the Janscnists. They thought they saw in the pains taken by the latter to spread the princi ples of St. Augustin on grace, and to render them acceptable, a secret design of ruining their society, whose doctrine did not agree with that of this fa ther ofthe church.

This terrible scock, which had separated a great part of the western christians from the Roman church, had scook this church itself to its foundations, and had long left there the leaven and the germs of fermentation. The spirit of inquiry, of chicane, and of controversy, were also awakened in it. The greater number of Catholics would have been pleased with certain reforms in the es- sence itself of the church, with amendments and regulations in the doctrine and discipline which did not take place, or were not conceived as they wisced : there were many discontented Catholics ; a great many of the abuses attacked by the Pro- testants appeared very culpable to these CatholicsJ; and several points of doctrine disputed by the first had given rise to consideration in these last. The council of Trent had not nearly satisfied any but the ultramontanes. In it, whatever related to the rights of the Pope and the hierarchy were carefully determined ; but the essential points of doctrine still remained in a painful uncertainty; as, for ex- ample, what scould be believed on grace, which held so important a place in the doctrine ofthe Lutherans, and that of the Calvinists. Baius, a theologian and professor at Louvain, who had as- sisted at the Council, raised a discussion on this sub ject, and occasioned it to be much talked of in his time.

The num-' ber of illustrious defenders of this party is known, and also that Port Royal became its chief place. The war of opinion which broke out between the Jansenists and Jesuits was the most violent that ever agitated the Roman church internally. The Jansenists, who, at the bottom had so many opinions in common with Luther and the other reformers, who with all their heart resisted the pretensions of Rome, and those of the satellite Jesuits of Rome, dreaded above all things the reproach of heresy, which was directed against them. They made it a sort of point of honour to write vigorously against the reformed, to give a signal proof that they were as good Catholics as their adversaries. At the fame time they wrote at least as vigorously against the Jesuits, and ac- quitted themselves of this essential task, con amove, with still greater eloquence than the other. Thus as the Jesuits had entered the lists of science -and wit with the Protestants; their adversaries, the Jansenists, were, for the fame reason, eager to scow themselves superior to the Jesuits in every department in which these scone ; they compos ed grammars, books of education and piety, treatises of logic, morality, history and erudition.* * It is curious to observe in these books, when they are read attentively by one acquainted with the literary history of the"], [314, "284 The Names of Lancelot, Arnauld, Tillemont, Nicole, Pascal, Sacy, etc. are as immortal as the remembrance of- the services they have rendered to the sciences and to our literature. It was to, arrive at this result that I introduced the preceding digression, which may, perhaps, appear to have led me out of my subject. But if it be considered that the society of Jesuits be came what it was, only because the popes wisced to make it a counterpoise to Protestantism, and a militia capable of perpetually opposing it, and also to re-establisc the tottering Holy Sec, it will be acknowledged that the existence of this society, as well as the principal events to which it has given rife, and the oppositions which it has excit ed, must be considered among the important results of the reformation. No reformation, no Jesuits ; and no Jesuits, no Jansenists, nor a Port Royal. Now, it is to the rivalry ofthe one against the other, and to the activity it gave to their minds, that we are indebted sora multitude of good works which appeared during the seventeenth century ; works, in which our language, and French prose in particular, attained a richness, a flexibility, a perfection, which it was far from having before. times, how much they are bestrewed (and even those which seem least adapted for that species of controversy, such as gfamm'ah'ihi. othttri) with stroke* directed against the Jefuir-., their classical books, their method of instruction, without their being once named or pointed at openly."], [315, "285 The polemical writings bent the language into all the forms of reasoning, and gave it precision, strength, and delicacy. I need only name the Provinciates, the Cleanthe of Barbier d'Aucour^ and I shall not dread being contradicted. .W\\ these literary events, so important tous, depend on the great event of the reformation : it is not a chain which I have arbitrarily formed to attach them to it ; it is the natural series of historical facts which I have ingenuously followed. Until their destruction, the Jesuits constantly continued to perform a principal part in all the disturbances which arose on religious or ecclesi astical, and, not unfrequently, on political subjects. In China and Japan, jealous of the missionaries unconnected with their society; in Europe, ene mies of the learned and modest fathers of the Ora tory, they provoked both the quarrel of the mis sions, and the condemnation of Father Ques nel, other troubles, which do not belong to our subject, except as they relate to letters, by the writings which they gave rise to. In this point of view we must also place the disputes, among the party of the mystics, towards the close of the seventeenth century, at the head of which appear the Abbe de Ranee, Mesdames Bourignon and Guyon, but particularly, the noble and pious Fenelon, who was implicated, by this circumstance, in a very animated controversy with Bojfuet. The name of these two illustrious adversaries is sufficient to bring within the number of events which hav\u00ab"], [316, "286 been of importance to literature, this Quietism, a sect which belongs, perhaps, as much to philoso phy as to theology, and which is not foreign either to the troubles of Jansenism, or to those of the church, in general, since the reformation. ItefleBion on the Employment of the ecclesiasti- cal Pojjeffions. It is very evident, that the financial administra tion is the object which governments believe most deserving of their whole attention : and the most important employment made of the finances ofa state is commonly war ; to attack or to defend itself; to restrain its neighbours by a formida ble army, always on soot, by fortresses, by arse nals. There is nothing in this but what is very laudable. Nevertheless, war is not the only ob ject of men in society: all war itself has peace for its object, and that of peace, is the furniscing the citizens of each state with the possibility of ennob ling and ameliorating their existence, of develop ing all their powers of morality and industry. Study and knowledge, which direct the efforts of mankind to the perfectioning and ennobling every thing which constitutes their nature, are, therefore, as a last result, the final object ofthe labours of fi nance, of war, and of peace. But here, as fre quently happens, the means overpower the end. How much is lavisced on war '. What parsimony"], [317, "287 is practised on the success of study and the ad vancement of morals ! In what order of things, in what age, in what country of the earth, could the culture of the sciences be more promoted than in a Catholic country ? Without the establisced government having new charges to defray, without the nation having new burthens, there is an entire cast of rich citizens, whose destination removes them from all the professions of civil life, who are in their essence devoted to a contemplative life, to a leisure which they might render learned and useful. A multitude of benefices, of prebends, of chapels, instead of being bestowed on the indo lent, might secure a maintenance to men of acti vity devoted to the sciences. Each monastery provided with an ample library, instead of pious sluggards, might contain studious recluses, whose labours would belong to the state. If the Spanisc nation, for example, had the will, it would be in its power, by the touch of the wand, to transform the whole system of its superstitious clergy, into a corporation of learned men and philosophers. In scort it would be consecrating to the mind what has been so long consecrated to the senses ; and Ged knows what advantage such an order, who would people the chapters and abbeys, who might be excused from matins, but not from la bour, or study, or meditation, might in ten years procure to the stock of sciences!

And how often have our kings recompensed literary merit with biscoprics ; how many literary men, assisted by a priory, a bene- fice, have lived in France, sceltered from want, and enabled to apply themselves to labours, which have enlightened and done honour to the nation ! Under the modest title of Abbe, which a simple tonsure rendered common to them, they became, in fact, the priests of the temple of science: from Amyot to the author of Anacharsis, how has this title of Abbe been ennobled and dig- nified ! It has been borne by a multitude of worthy and learned men of letters, who pro- bably would have remained obscure and inactive, without that portion of the wealth of the church, which warmed them and permitted them, free and exempt from cares, to enter upon the career. With us, the revolution has dried up this be neficent source, which might have been ren dered so useful to the progress of knowledge.* * It has done more : it has swallowed up almust all the patrimony ofthe ancient establishments of instruction, and has thus deprived the new, which they are labouring to establish"], [319, "289 Several of the reformed states have retained some means of encouragement to letters.

The possessions of the church have been there principally employed in the endowment of uni- versities and other schools ; so that the greater part, of their, writers are professors, very scantily paid, or superiors or inferiors of schools, who, fre quently burthened with a numerous family, set a value on the recompense of an author; and whom this stimulus too frequently induces to write quick, that they may write a great deal. of that material and indispenfible basis, without which, such eftablistiments can neither subsist solidly, with honour or ef ficacy. An endowment and a real property, to be managed by a local adminiltration, are absolutely necessary to every' school which would prosper : it requires a security, an exist-' ence different from what may arise from the casualty of un- . certain boarders, or the assistance of government, which having to provide for a multitude of other wants, will, very fre quently, be compelled to leave such objects unattended to.

The documents of religion, the titles of the hierarchy are subjected to a severe and profound criticism : and as the study of the holy books, that ofthe fathers, of the councils, of the decretals are connected with that of antiquity, history, the languages, the masterpieces of Greece and Rome, all these great objects of classical learn- ing assume a new aspect, and are illuminated with a new light. The scholastic philosophy, the ally and supporter of the ancient system, finds, in these innovators, formidable adversaries, who unveil its vices and attack its weak sides. The torch of rea son, which the edifice of the scholastics kept in concealment, begins to scine again.

This activity makes its happy influence to be felt on every branch of human knowledge ; and the scrutinizing disposition impressed on all minds by the reformation, puts philosophical inquiries and the most sublime theories of the sciences and the arts in motion. D'Alembert has sketched this picture with a masterly hand, and at a single stroke. He fays, \" the middle of the sixteenth century saw a rapid change in the religion and the system ofa great part of Europe ; the new doctrines of the reformers, supported on the one hand and opposed on the other, with that warmth which the interests of God, well or ill understood, can alone inspire, equally compelled their partisans and their adver saries to seek instruction ; the emulation excited by this great motive multiplied knowledge of every kind ; and the light produced in the bosom of error and trouble spread itself to those objects also which seemed most foreign to these dis putes.\"* The long, multiplied, and desolating wars which this commotion gave rise to, retarded some of the effects which scould have resulted from it.

But scortly, their souls, steeped in misfortune, resumed their energy, and the imperiscable spirit which had been awakened, displayed all its activity. At first, it wandered among the devious paths of theological contro versies, but, at length, it returned more supple and more accustomed to meditation. Nevertheless, the necessity the different parties felt to gain over the multitude of nations, causes them to cultivate the vulgar languages, and multiplies good writings in them ; the French, Englisc, and German prose is developed, perfectionated, and enriched, amidst the disputes of sects and the conflict of religious opinions. Particular associations arise, or are strengthened on the different sides, either for attack or for de fence ; some mysterious and persecuted, the others open and privileged. The order of Jesuits, the most important of them all, is placed in op position to the reform. It requires a preponder ance proportionate to the enormous mass it is des tined to counterbalance.

CONCLUSION. Such are the principal results which, I am of Opinion, originated in the influence exercised on Europe by Luther's reformation. In analyzing the complicated causes of the most considerable events which have occurred during three centuries in the political world, and in the literary world, it is easy to go astray, to mistake some causes, to lose sight of some effects. Amidst the confusion of all these entangled threads of European po litics and culture, he who seeks to unravel those immediately connected with the quarrels on re ligion, however careful he may be, will too often be in danger of erring. Some of them issue from the establiscment itself, from the preaching of the Alcoran, from chivalry, the crusades, the use of artillery, the discovery of a new world, the renovation of letters, the institutions of Peter 1. the succession war, and the other major events. Were it required to determine the influence of some one of these events, perhaps such of the consequences as I have attributed to the reforma tion might be claimed as belonging to it. Histo rians who narrate facts, are generally silent on their causes, and frequently also are unacquainted"], [324, "294 t with them. Sometimes they give those which are false and contradictory. The writers of the opposing parties are exclusive, and render the truth uncertain. To whom must credit be giv en ; the Catholics, or the Protestants : to Duperron or Dumoulin; to Platina or Mornay ? How shall we decide between Varillas and Maimbourg, on the one side, Sleidan, Bayle, and Seckendorf on the other ; between Pallavicini and Fra-Paolo ,\u2022 be tween Bojfuet and Claude ? In the work of the reformation, the one sees only an infinite source of errors and calamities ; the others see in it only knowledge and benefits to the human race. Among so many different opinions, each must have his own. We are at present better situ ated than ever to judge of a revolution which broke out three hundred years ago : let us con sider what was before it, and what has happened since ; let us hear all parties, look around us, see what exists at the present day, and judge. When after the long sleep of the European nations and of their reason, during the middle age, we turn our attention to the state of the human race in this fine part of the world, in the fifteenth, and at the beginning ofthe sixteenth cen turies, we sha.ll sce it recoverfrom its stupefaction, rise, move unsteadily in all directions, seize in struments for its activity, forge new ones, try them, develop its powers, take possession of the field of science, throw from it the swaddling clothes which embarrass it, and begin a new epe- 5"], [325, "295 cha. How is this interval crowded with decisive occurrences and inventions ! The happy employ- ment of the mariner's compass, the telescope, printing, the taking of Constantinople, the new world, the submission of the great vassals to the crown of France, the golden age of poetry and the arts in Italy, the foundation of numerous schools, the books of the ancients revived in it, the esta- bliscment of posts, which render all communica tions rapid, the salutary peace of the empire and the imperial chamber, the extravagant increase of the Austrian power which terrifies Europe, and compels it to arm, Copernicus who reforms the heavens, Luther and Loyola who arose nearly at the fame time ! The crisis must necessarily have a term, the state of things must change in the order of civil societies, and in that of human knowledge. \" Better is an enemy to well,\" fays a proverb of modern Italy. This ridiculous adage, which ought never to have quitted the language in which it appeared, is the unsophisticated expression of an ultramontane character. Happily it is not in the power ofa despised cast, nor ofa maxim against nature, thus to fetter the destinies of science and civilization. Men pass them, and give no credit to such reclamations, the reclamations, fays Che tiier,* of those idle and jealous spirits, whose reason, \u2022In bis Discours sur le progres des cmnoissaitces, An.

As lances and scields had been laid aside for fire arms, so must the scholastic philosophy be removed by the new arms of reason ; the inextricable circles of Ptolemy, by the simple idea of the motion of the earth; and the false decretals must fall at the first looks of criticism. The external form of reli gion no longer corresponded with the new culture, any more than the representation of mysteries corresponded with the scene on which Moliere and Corneille were about to appear ; any more than Gothic architecture with the basilick of St. Peter. It was requisite that every thing scould change : the new spirit could not subsist in the ancient forms ; a harmony, an agree ment must be establisced between it and things ; and since it had in itself the energy of a new life, the omnipotence of youth, it acted in all directions with strength and efficacy, and was every where seconded by enthusiasm. It is therefore under this point of view that the reformation must be considered as a necessary product of a new age, as a manifestation of a new spirit. What Dyinte and Petrarch were to poetry, Michael Angelo and Raphael to the arts of draw ing, Bacon and Descartes to philosophy, Copernicus and Gallileo to astronomy, Columbus and Gama to the science ofthe earth, such was Luther to reli gion. Organs ofthe universal mind, these emi-"], [327, "297 ftent men expressed correctly what was lurking in a great number of their cotemporaries, and at one stroke, satisfied the wants of their time. As soon as the spark flasced from their genius, the flame, ready to appear, spread in all directions. What was only a prescience, a vague idea, insu lated in a number of heads, acquired a consistence, a fixed direction, appeared externally, was com municated from individual to individual, and a continued chain connected all thinking minds. Such is the natural mode of the tacit conspi ra tion which governs all reformations. Those effected in the dominion of the arts and of the major part of the sciences, being foreign to the passions and to the volcanic commotions of the mass of the people, are generally accompanied by peace, and are accomplisced without causing the tears of humanity to flow. It could not be thus with that provoked by Luther. Religion was not then a simple opinion, a simple moral being ; it had an immense body, which oppressed all the political bodies, which laid claim to all thrones, to all the possessions of the earth. At the first wound it felt, the colossus scudd\u00abred, and the world was scaken. Princes and nations flew to arms and engaged in a dreadful struggle, a strug gle of opinions and interests, the results of which were so varied and so important. The Institute has demanded an account of such of these results as have influenced the political situation of the states of Europe, and"], [328, "298 the progress of knowledge. This task was enon- mous, and far above my powers. What would it have been if the Institute, besides the poli- tical and literary consequences, had required an exposition of the influence of the reforma- tion on the morality of the European nations, on their belief and their religious dispositions ? But this new point of view might be the sub- ject of a work, perhaps more extensive and more difficult than mine. I was obliged to confine myself within the prescribed limits, which circumscribe a field of vast extent. It has not been my intention to disguise either the evil or the good produced by the reformation. I have only sought to prove that, every thing being balanced, and the definitive account closed, this revolution offers a surplus of good to humanity; and, finally, that it must be ranked in the num- ber of the major events which have contributed most powerfully to the progress of civilization and knowledge, not only in Europe, but in every part of the earth where Europeans have carried their culture. I have also thought that I might express myself with the open freedom of an historian, who, if possible, scould not belong to any age or any country : supporting myself with an opinion that prejudice could not find access into the sanctuary of the sciences ; and that an illustrious society so philosophical as to chuse such a subject, and to ask for the truth respecting it, would, doubtless, be disposed to listen to it."], [329, "APPENJMX.

He had reigned forty year?, when Jesus was bora ist Palestine, bf poo: and obscure parents."], [330, "300 The mythology of paganism, formed for the infancy of the world, had grown old with it ; at the period of which we speak, it had lost its ancient credit with opinion, and the va cuum it had left there only waited to be filled. During the course of his conquests, Alexander had carried the culture of Greece into the east : afterwards, when his successors had raised thrones, occupied by Greek princes in Egypt, Persia, Asia Minor, and Armenia, the Grecian philosophy flourished in these countries, and modified the local spirit of them. In its turn it had experienced a reaction ; and the mystic theism of India, the two principles of Persia, and the mysteries of Egypt were united with the doctrine of the Academy arid the Portico. This new mixture of ideas caused a fermentation. The chief tendency of all these elements, otherwise but little homogeneous, was the acknowledgment and wor ship of an invisible God. Polytheism, the adoration of rude and visible go'ds, must be gradually undermined by this dispo sition of the most enlightened minds. The Romans found Greece and the east in this state, when, in their turn, they mastered them ; and the conquerors drew after them, to the west, the men and the spirit of the east. The learning and philosophy of the Greeks became the basis of culture, among the Romans, and with a few modifications, produced the same effects there, as in Greece and in Egypt. The ancient worship was despised, the augurs were now never met but with asneer. Deism lurked in the schools at Rome, as well as at .Athens, Smyrna, and Alexandria; but this speculative doctrine re quired a real form which might give it a practical and positive existence, which might make it a religion. It is necessary to observe that the Mediterranean was then the Great Sea, the common of the nations which constituted the Roman empire, and their medium of communication. The coasts which encircled it on all sides rendered their inha bitants like countrymen. Athens, Joppa, and Rome were more neighbours, than inland cities at a short distance from each other ; the commerce of the world, which was carried on that sea, all the transactions which related to Rome, ren dered their communications by it easy and frequent."], [331, "301 On one ofthe coasts of this sea, in the centre ofthe empire^ founded by the conquering Macedonian, on the site of the ancient Phenicia, in contact, to the south, with Egypt and Arabia; to the Cast, with Persia and India; to the north, with Syria, Armenia, and the Scythian tribes ; finally, by it? ports, with Greece, Italy, and the other maritime countries, lived a small people despisedj vanquished, and subject alter nately to its different neighbours ; hating all the other nations from principle, commercial and industrious from necessity, dispersed every where, without nuxiho with foreigners, and, ih each place, forming a society separate from others, and retaining their own laws, their worship, and their temples. This people had a national religion founded on the adoration of one sole God. In the midst of Syrian, Egyptian, Greek, and Roman' polytheism, here theism was constituted a positive religion; a unique phenomenon in the vast empire of the C\u00e6sars. It is obvious that I allude to the Jews. Proud of their origin, which they traced back to illustrious patriarchs, united by the ties of the same bloods sole objects of the pre dilection of God, and chosen by him from among all nations, ancient prophecies assured them that a king of the earth should be born in the midst of them, who should wash away \u2022ill their disgrace, and should raise them above the rest of the world. They lived in an unquiet expectation of this Messiah, and ardently calculated the time,' obscurely indi- cated, of his coming. A similar spirit did not, at that time, exist in any other nation. This, gloomy, concentrated, con- sumed with the pride which its more than terrestrial nobility inspired,' and with the humiliation in which it was constrained to live, consoled itself for the one by the other, and returned the scorn they experienced from their idolatrous neighbours, a hundred fold. This deep disposition has not yet perished : in his universal captivity, almost every where degraded t:i the lowest station, the unshaken Israelite says in his heart, \"Iain the man of God.\" Considering the disposition of opinions at that time with .respect to the unity of the divine essence, and a more i"], [332, "302 purified worship to be offered to it, it was natural that the philosophers and unemployed thinkers, who were greatly multiplied during the long calm of the reign of Augustus, should give some attention to this people, to their dogmas and their books, of which there was a Greek vertion. Their eyes, therefore, began to be fixed upon them: in lhe cities of she empire, where the Jews had established synagogues, a num ber of Pagans frequented their meetings, through a more lively interest than that of curiosity. The Jews, on their part, could not escape the action of the general spirit of the. time; if their ideas began to penetrate into the schools, the ideas of the philosophers also penetrated into the synagogues. The Jews shone as philosophers among the Pagans, particu larly at Alexandria, which was at that time the focus of the new Academy, and which was, besides, the largest city in the. \u25a0vicinity of Judea. These innovations spread to the walls of Jerusalem. Thetheosophy of the Magi of the east also reached it: they began to dispute, to refine, to wish to modify the Judaical orthodoxy. Sects were the consequence, which contended with fury. Many of the Jews, on examining their worship more closely, found in it what the Pagans found in theirs, too many external forms, too great a surcharge, too many superstitions and abuses. Some wanted a reformer, others a Saviour to relieve them from this crisis ; in the eye* of the Jews this could be n\u00b0 other, for all of them, than the Messiah himself. The expectation of this supernatural being was therefore more inflamed than ever. Unsettled bands quitted the towns to go and listen to preachers and prophets in the desert. John baptized and preached on the banks of the Jordan. He also announced the Messiah, and the num ber of his partisans was considerable. It was in the midst of this people, and of these circum \u2022tartces that Jesus appeared. He drew off the disciples of John, and the remainder of the multitude, and the other prophets were silent. He preached with the tranquil majesty of a spirit invested with a superior mission, having no other function on earth but to establish truth, piety, and love, among raor-"], [333, "303 tals. Serious and accordant in his actions ; ingenuous, simple, and sublime in his discourses, his soul appeared calm, trans. parent, and profound, like the celestial ether. Supremely mild and loving, a holy zeal againstimpiety and the rude vices with which his eye was afflicted, could alone move and discompose him for an instant: this is the picture given of Jesus by his four historians. If he was not such, the genius which could invent so perfect an ideal being, and, more especially, the chance v\u00bbhich caused the four evangelists, who probably were without communication, to invent, uniformly, the same ideal being, is certainly worthy of admiration. But if he was such, as there can be no doubt he was, then of what nature must this extraordinary being be, who resembles none of the great men whom history has transmitted to us, and whose life, without spot, as without affectation, does not permit one of the weaknesses of humanity to be apparent. Jesus, during the short period of his preaching, sowed the imperishable seeds of a doctrine of pure adoration, love, and justice; or rather, he only sanctioned and vivified these seeds, innate in all hearts. And a prodigy as astonishing as his mission, and as every thing relating to his person, is, that a Jew, a member, in appearance, of a nation the most selfish, the most obstinately individual, the most inimical to the whole human race, established the first idea of a universal religion, of a cosmopolite church, of a fraternity of all men, under the . authority of a common father. A father, a family, a worship, a love. The\" idea was prodigious for the time ; it was much more so, as arising and being established in Judea. Jesus gave it as a sole precept, developed it, applied it to all cases, ordered his apostles, men, simple and unlettered, to go and spread it among all people, announcing to them that it should flourish every where : they went, they spoke, and the world became Christian. Nevertheless, Jesus, pursued by the fa naticism of the priests of the ancient law, was the same in the midst of executioners and pains, as he had been among bis disciples, a super-human model of patience and firmness, of mildaes* and sublimity. \" My father,\" thus he prayed"], [334, "304 for hi! persecutors, \" forgive them, for they know notwhatthrjf do.\" This last proof was required to offer a practical example of the most difficult of virtues. After this nothing remained; for him to do ; all things were fulfilled, to use his own lan guage, and he died the glorious death of a martyr of trath and virtue. This picture ofthe pure spirit of Christianity in the person of its founder, will not appear to be misplaced, in an attempt to apprecitite a revolution, the principal object of which was to bring Christianity back to the spirit of its institution. After the death of Jesus, a great number of his disciples, collected at Jerusalem, celebrated there, together, and in his name, the Judaical feast of Pentecost, and thus formed the first community of Christians which had taken place. TJ.ia weak church was soon almost entirely dispersed, when two years after fanaticism pursued it again, and Stephen the deacon, that is the depositary of the alms, became the victim of it. This blow would perhaps have been mortal to the new church, if, at the same time, a man possessed of that genius which. animates all, of that strength and obstinate courage which surmounts all obstacles, Paul, hitherto the persecutor of the Christians, had not become one of their number. This new apostle, who, alone, did more for the rising religion than all the others, invited the men of, all countries, and of every religion, to become sectaries of Christ., Up to this period, none but Jews had entered into this association, to the mem- bers of which the name of Nazareans had been given. Paul introduced new ideas, new views in his eloquent discourses} he announced the doctrine of its founder, with a spirit which. was not, and could not be that of the other disciples, who were more attached to Judaism, more infected with its pre^ judices, which occasioned in these early days a schism be- tween the Christians who- were his partisans, and those who remained attached to the localities of Judaism, a division which led to the necessity of a meeting for the better understanding each other. This assembly, the first type of councils, was held at Jerusalem, and continued there until the subversion of g"], [335, "305 the republic of the Hebrews. This event separated them ; butit also, trom thenceforward, separated Mosaism and Chris tianity, between which Paul had drawn an eternal line of demarkation. His voyages, his discourses; his epistles, some of which have reached our time, established, in the majority of the churches which were founded in his life-time; this sub lime doctrine, modified by him, and for which we are indebted to his indefatigable zeal. Seven lustres after Jesus all his first confidants had perished, either by a natural death, or by the hands of executioners : from among them all, only the Apostle John remained, who, flying from the persecution under De ntition, took refuge in Patmos, where he wrote the Apocalypse, which is placed among the sacred books (supposing that it may in fact be his). These divisions on dogmas which are in the essence of every speculative doctrine, whether philosophical or religious, had already appeared among the Christians per secuted by the princes ofthe earth. These internal evils of the church seem to have created more fear in the apostle of Patmos, than the external evil of persecutions. Cerinthus and others published at that time some new opinions on the divinity of Jesus, and almost every thing written by John is directed against these opinions. Nevertheless the number of Christian churches increased daily, and in all countries. A peaceable state of affairs might perhaps have confined the religion of Christ within the walls of Jerusalem for ever. But the Jews themselves, who, at first drove out the innovators, by this measure, compelled them to go and preach in other places : these exiles, in almost every country met with other Jews, whom the commerce and restless disposition of this people had already scattered in so many places. The Jew-christians fraternized with them, and preached in their synagogues, which were frequented by a number of Pagans, drawn, as has been already said, by the spectacle ofa worship founded on the adoration of one God. The Romans, by ruining Jerusalem and dispersing the Jewish people, also increased these favourable circumstances. Cele brated cities, such as Alexandria, were peopled with Jews, -x"], [336, "306 and, consequently, with Christians also. The new doctrine became an object of interest and discussion. Paganism, too absurd in itself to suit a period which was no longer that of ths infancy of the world, decried by philosophers, was almost be- come the ridicule of every enlightened man. This is, without doubt, the true cause of the cessation of oracles about this time. They were silent when they could not find believers. The want ofa religion, capable of replacing the ancient one, which had perished through age and imbecility, began to be felt. Besides, the gods being the national patrons of the an- cients, each nation had respected its gods so long as it re- mained a nation. Conquered and subjugated by the Ro- mans, the people became indifferent to every object of local patriotism and religion, as well as to others. The Romans themselves, from receiving foreign gods into their temples, had reached the point of despising all, the ancient as well as the new comers. The positive operation of religion fell to ruin in the empire; the religious sentiment which is the basis of all the positive systems, and which still lived in their hearts, waited only a new form in which it might fix. Chris- tianity, favoured by the circumstances which have been in- dicated, offered itself, and found easy access. But how many strange ideas, how many accessory doctrines came from all parts to mix with it, and to modify it in a thousand ways! The history of doctrine, in the first centuries, is a labyrinth which the historian cannot completely elucidate. Before st body of doctrine was established and settled, what fluctuati- ons, what variations it had undergone ! and when, at length, a fixed principle was determined on , how much did it differ from what it Lad been in the spirit and uncompounded views of its founder ! It was principally at Alexandria, then a city of much learning, and the point us union of the Greek philo- sophers, and among others of the new Platonigts, that the re-. ligion of Jesus, swelled with so many heterogeneous elements took a more speculative, or perhaps, a more mystical foTm than it had done at first. Clement, a Greek philosopher who had become a Christian, contributed rftore to this than any"], [337, "307 Cther person. Such ofthe Orientals as embraced Christianity introduced into it the ideas of the eastern philosophy on that origin of the world, of good and of evil. Hence arose the Gnostic and Manichean modifications, or sects of Christianity. Although the other Christians afterwards separated the canort of their dogmas, from the dogmas of these oriental Christians, the latter nevertheless still influenced, to a certain point, th\u00bb subsequent constitution of Christianity in general ; and it was preserved, more or less unchanged, among the Oriental Chris tians. It would be superfluous to name all the different opi nions which arose in different places during these first centuries, and of which the greater part are known by the name of their inventors, or by the characteristic term whicli became the rallying word of the sect : these names would form here a dry nomenclature, and the explanation of them would be too long. It is sufficient to observe, in general, that when a certain majority of Christians, favoured by circumstances, began to form a common confession of faith for themselves, they gave the name of heresies to the opinions which differed from theirs. One consideration also worthy of notice, is, that the perse cutions of some of the emperors against the Christians in general, caused a great number of individuals of these differ ent sects to fly into solitary and uninhabited places, carrying with them only their fervent devotion, which soon exalted the silence and melancholy ofthe desert to an extravagant pitch. These ascetics of Thebesand Syria were the first monks ; their meetings to pray in common, the first convents. Legislators; arose among them whose only aim was to give laws, really christian, to Christians. So many monastic rules are, in fact, only different manners of understanding Christianity, of puri fying, of reforming it. The monastic orders necessarily changed their form as the church itself was changed, but they were nothing else in their origin. The same persecutions as had peopled the deserts with fu gitive Christians, obliged those who remained to connect themselves more strongly with each other; to stifle, as much as possible their cpntroversies, to agree with and aid each \u2022x 2"], [338, "308 other ; to become organized ; to lay down regulations ; tt\u00bb appoint chiefs and administrators. While the apostles and some cotemporary disciples of Jesus lived, they were naturally the heads ofthe communities or churches of which they were the institutors. After their death, the last pastor was re- placed by his principal disciple. Several of these churches sometimes agreed with each other, and formed a sort of con- federation which appointed a common head, avisitor, episcopus, or bishop : afterwards, they separated to subsist alone, or to unite with others. In general they kept, voluntarily, within the limits ofa province, praefecture, or diocese of the Roman empire. Each Christian, however, was a disciple, an active member of the church or confederation to which he belonged. The pastors were the spiritual magistrates of them, republican magistrates, whose decision, in matters of belief, was only valid, because they were believed to be wiser or better inform- ed. Nevertheless, as these Christians and these pastors were men, and as men follow, unintentionally, every human idea and institution, it was a necessary consequence, that those pastors to whom local circumstances had given a more- considerable, more rich, or more powerful church, and among others, those of the churches established in the chief cities of the empire, were soon invested with more consideration and authority, and a sort of primacy, the origin of the patri- archal or papal power. This primacy was at first extremely limited. As yet the Roman emperors had only known the new religion to tolerate or persecute it. When it reached the heart of Constantine, who raised it to the throne, all was changed. Temporal power, honours, riches, became the lot of the principal pastors : '.he humble doctrine of Jesus, formed for the consolation and support of those who lived under op- pression on the earth, by the hope of a letter life, became the doctrine of the powerful and the oppressor. According to the sect, the particular opinion of the theologian who pos- sessed the ear of his master, he procured the condemnation and persecution of the sects and opinions differing from his own. Christianity, so essentially mild and humane, became"], [339, "309 -persecuting from retaliation, from imitation, and because it had been persecuted. The cruel examples of Dioclesian, Decius, and other emperors, have had terrible re-acting ef fects, which have continued far into the modern centuries. It is the passions of men which have occasioned so many ills ; let us guard against attributing them to the pure doctrines of Jesus, to whom humanity is indebted for the adoration of one .God, the sublime principle of love and fraternity among all men, the abolition of slavery in many places, and so many other inestimable benefits. Thus this first period, which had begun with Jesus, who \u2022Came to promise a kingdom in the heavens to men of peace, is terminated by Constantine, who gives the sectaries of Jesus all earthly possessions, and lays for them the foundations of a kingdom in this world."], [340, "310 SECOND PERIOD. OLIGARCHY. (.From Constantine to Mahomet. \u2014 From 325 to 60i.) Establishment of the Patriarchal System. jThe christian association takes' a new form and new de velopments. The supreme authority is become christian, and impresses a temporal character of power and authenticity on every thing which is christian. The principal pastors take their station near the throne, He who occupies it is their disciple; their support, sometimes their instrument, at other times also their despot. The occurrences, the dogmas of Christianity become objects of public interest. The church acquires a certain unity, by associating in the unity of the empire ; the commotions which arise in it are felt more universally in this new organization, which closely unites all parties. Heresies and innovating opinions excite a more general fermentation. What formerly only agitated one town or one province, becomes an object of discussion to the whole Roman empire. The assemblies of the pastors (synods ac~ cording to the Greek etymology, councils according to the Latin) take a more official and more imposing form. Their decrees become the laws of the empire, sanctioned by its chief. Already the partisans of bishop Donatus had been condemned by the council held at Aries. But the first principal heresy which put the powers of the united church to the test was that of Arius, a philosopher of the new platonic school and priest of Alexandria. It was by this school that the idea was introduced among christians of representing Christ, the son of God, as his Word. The bishop"], [341, "311 <il Alexandria maintained that this logos, this word, was co eternal and co-substantial with God. Arius, who besides had not much love for this bishop, and had been his competitor on the vacancy of the see, affirmed, on the contrary, that the logos proceeding from God, could not be co-eternal and co substantial with him. This dispute inflamed the christian church in the east and west for several centuries. Constantine convoked the famous assembly of Nice, the first which re ceived the title of an \u0153cumenical, that is to say, universal council. Arius was condemned in it ; which did not prevent th\u00ab Arians from triumphing afterwards on several occasions and under different names. There also was composed, against their doctrine the famous creed which was afterwards at tributed to the apostles, and which is but too strongly marked with the stamp of this subtle disputation. Among other re gulations of the same assembly may also be remarked that which fixed a uniform passover for the whole of Christianity. But the bishop, the antagonist of Arius, was. dead, and the deacon Athanasius had succeeded him at Alexandria. The latter was, like his predecessor, the most powerful support of the Nicene orthodo.xy, and he soon experienced the grief of seeing tbe inconstant C\u00e6sar change his creed. E-usebius, a bishop of Arius' s party, won the sister of. the emperor, and she persuaded her brother. Arius was solemnly restored to the communion o\u00a3 the church, by aa imperial decree, and AtharMsius was deposed from his see. It was this Arian Eusebius who, a short time before his death, administered baptism to Constantine, which this prince had neglected to receive sooner. Without doubt, if he had lived longer, Aiianism, which the subtle Eusebius had made the doctrine of the imperial court, would have become the dominant doctrine of the christian world. But he died ; his three sons divided the empire, and each protected a different party. The partisans of the council of Nice, whose system was fixed by 'an invariable formula,- remained clisely united. The Arians, as i's the case with all reformers, whose too liberal opinion Lcannot be bound to an irrevocable form, divided into so many"], [342, "312 different Sects, that they weakened themselves, and were un\u00bb able, in detail, to resist adversaries so well combined. Semi- Arians opposed Arians; Pneumatics opposed Eunomians. Each party reiving on its C\u00e6sar, the religious animosity be came a political and national animosity. The more vivacity shown by Constant in support of the Nicenes in the west, the more warmly did Constantius protect the Arianism modified by Eusebius in the east. The general council convoked by the two emperors at Sardica, in Bulgaria, to reconcile the two parties, had no other result than a more envenomed hatred between the Nicene bishops and those of Eusebius's party, as generally happens when irreconcileable enemies are brought together, from the opposition of their interests and the asperity of their ill-will. After the murder of Constans, his brother remained sole master ; he made his dear Arians triumph with a high hand, and particularly in the two councils of Sirraich, where P/iotin, bishop of that city, was condemned, A mul- titude of sects, which Constantius strove incessantly to stifle or to restrain, disturbed the whole course of his life, and he died amidst the tumult which they raised on all sides.. His successor Julian, far from seeking, like him, to appease them, excited them from pleasure, encouraged them, laughed at them in his palace, and, without, treated them with the most serious irony. He could not have chosen a more certain method of ruining the christian church which he did not love. The Nicene bishops soon assembled in council at Paris, and de- clared all the Arian bishops apostates. Athanasius, returned from his exile and restored to the see of .Alexandria, made it a duty to depose all of the.se apostates who were within his jurisdiction. Lucifer, bishop of Cagliari, in Sardinia, went still further than the council of Paris: he severely p nsured the amnesty granted by it to the Arians who would submit to sign the formulary of Nice, and separated from the lukewarm Catholics who consented to suffer former heretics to be among them. However, Julian' reigned too short a time to see his crafty policy succeed. 'IV two principal parties, that of Nice and that of Arius, maintained themselves with v."], [343, "313 equal strength, under the two following emperors, Valens and Valentinian; the one protecting the first party in the west, and the other the second in the east. Valens, a de termined Arian, exerted all his power to eradicate semi ananism, as well as Catholicism from the provinces under his dominion. His zeal was also seconded by the death of Athanasius, and afterwards by that of Valentinian, in whom the doctrine of Nice lost its firmest supporters. This con fession also saw a very dangerous and very active enemy issue from its own bosom. The bishop Apollinuris, ofa subtle and philosophical spirit, promulgated an opinion on the incarnated word in the person of Jesus, which, according to him, was only a vehicle, a purely passive covering to the word ; an opinion which produced a fermentation and violent schism. At length, under Gratian and Theodosius the Great, Catholicism became again victorious through the protection of these two princes. They neglected nothing to compel the teachers of Arianism to silence, and this doctrine would then have re ceived its mortal blow, had it not found an unhoped for asylum. New actors appeared on the scene of the world, and came from the extremity of the north to contend with the C\u00e6sars for the principal character in it. The Goths, trenched upon the frontiers of tbe empire : they became Christians, but Arian-christians, and it was among them that this sect took refuge to escape its ruin, which seemed in evitable. The Nicene doctrine, however, was more and more con solidated in the empire. Theodosius sole master during fifteen years, (for who can reckon the weak and short reigns of Gratian and Valentinian II. J Theodosius carried the power and credit of the clergy to a greater height. Through his means, a bishop became a more important personage than ever. Those bishops, to whom circumstances had given a certain primacy over the others, acquired still greater impor tance ; and the most considerable of all, those of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, who"], [344, "314 took tbe title of patriarchs, fathers, or popes, were, by de\u00bb grees, considered as the princes and chiefs of the christian church. Exalted aiove the others, nothing remained for each of them but the ambition of exalting himself also above hiscolleagues. Those of .Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, too remote from the; centre of power, could not attain to a, preponderance capable of raising them above competition. It is evident that the palm could only be contested between tho two patriarchs whose sees were placed in the two capitals of the empire, near the two thrones of the west and cast. The talents, address, ambition and virtues, of those who alternately occupied these two sees, the favour of the princes, their pre dilection sometimes for the ancient, and sometimes for the new Rome, a multiplicity of circumstances which belong as much to the history of the empire, as to that of the church. caused the balance to incline alternately to ons or the other side. If the patriarch of Constantinople had in his favour, his more proximate residence to the emperor, he had also against him the vicinity of the court, which would not permit a priest to exalt himself too much. The bishops who, at that time were very badly provided for, and who abounded in this capital, frequently intrigued against the patriarch, of whom they were all jealous, and sometimes succeeded in humbling him. The Roman pastor, on the contrary, had not so much to dread from this troublesome and dangerous neighbourhood of the imperial majesty, and ofthe intrigues of a court. He had in his savour the great name of Rome, before which nations were accustomed to bend. It is known that the translation of the government to Constantinople had no other effect than to weaken it, and that this second capital could never attain to the consideration of the first. The patriarch of Constantinople therefore could only be subordinate, in a city held itself in subordinacy: while his rival at Rome was allowed to perform the first charactei in the first city of the world. To this may be added that the people which subdued Rome and the west, became Christians ; while those who sub dued Constantinople and all the east, established the religion of"], [345, "315 Mahomet there. Is it therefore strange, if the Roman bishop, assisted by a skilful and persevering policy, at length pre vailed over all the others? The magic of this name of Rome has fascinated almost all ages, and has reached ours, without having lost all the force of its charm. But these reflections anticipate events, and the bishops; and patriarchs still compose an oligarchy, in which none submits legally to the authority of a single one. Laymen and priests still preserve their rights, and patriarchs bow to the authority of a council, diet, or parliament of this church republic. Let us resume the series of principal facts. Basil surnamed the Great, bishop of Cesarea, defended the Nicen\u00ab .creed with his singular talents and his writings, while Tlie jodosius supported it by his edicts. One of them decreed, \"that those only should be acknowledged for Catholic Chris- tians, who, with Damasut bishop of Rome, and Peter bishop of Alexandria, would confess the co-substantial and eternal divinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Whoever should refuse, was to be considered as a heretic and an idiot, and to be delivered over to the secular arm.\" Gregory of Naziance, .at that time patriarch of Constantinople, the friend of Basil, did not cordially approve of this rigour, and if he did not blame it aloud, it was, no doubt, from a hope that by means of it, the peace and concord so much to be desired in the church would be restored. But in vain. A second imperial edict, which prohibited the public exercise of their worship ta -all other Christians except those of the confessioH of Nice, did not produce a more salutary effect. It was resolvedto call a second \u0153cumenical council, from which a remedy for all the evils which afflicted the church was expected. The place of meeting was fi.\\ed at Constantinople. The new council con firmed and determined with still more precision the doctrine of one God in three persons, and of the co-substantiality of these three persons. The imperial authority sanctioned these decrees, caused th#m to be publicly acknowledged as the. Catholic creed, and denounced corporal punishment against all who should think otherwise, After having placed this"], [346, "316 restraint on the sectarian spirit among Christians, Theodosius applied himself to prosecuting the remains ofpaganism, which no longer found sectaries except among the lowest classes of people. This fervour was more easily extinguished than that which animated the christian theologians against each other. Notwithstanding the edicts of the emperors, the controversies were continually renewed ; the inflexible obstinacy and fury of the opponents, with the hatred they bore each other, produced excesses disgraceful to the church. The noble Priscilian was the first illustrious victim who offered the ex ample of christian blood shed by the hands of Christians. Two bishops, unworthy of the title, prosecuted him with fury, before Maximilian, tyrant of the Gauls ; his learning and his virtues could not save him from punishment, and he was sacrificed for his opinions, by the sacerdotal hatred of two men, in whom Christianity saw its Anitus and its Melitus. So many theological disputes, and subtle opinions, among \u25a0which the original simplicity of the worship of Christians had vanished, began to tire the minds of the multitude, who were incapable of following their pastors in the discussion of these dogmas. Under the two sons of Theodosius, the barbarians \u25a0penetrated into the Roman empire, on different sides, into which they brought ignorance, devastation, and war. The quarrels of religion within ; the Goths, the Alans, the Suevi, the Vandals, the Burgundians without; nothing more was requisite to plunge the whole of Christianity into ignorance. The ecclesiastics remained the sole depositaries of know ledge. It was principally in the east that the controversies were the hottest. One general character which distinguishes the two churches, and which their history seldom contradicts, is, that in the east, where men are more contemplative and more pure, they commonly disputed on doctrine; while in the west, where the mind is apparently more turned to sub stantial and temporal matters, scarcely any contest arises, except on rank and primacy. There, articles of faith ; here, articles of discipline and hierarchy. The Roman patriarchs who found themselves invested with the primacy in the west,"], [347, "317 Carefully promoted this spirit, or rather created it there. The true creed of this see was to convert every ciicum.tar.ee, whether political or religious, to advantage, for the increase of its power and consequence. It occurred oftener than once, that, while the good Orientals differed ingeniously on some mystical question, the Roman pontiff enjoyed the triumph of being appointed judge over his colleagues of Constan tinople, or Alexandria ; as happened to Anastasius I. on the subject of the differences occasioned by the Origenists. About this time lived the priest Hierony mus, (whose name we corrupt by calling him Jerome) a man of great capacity ; he resided sometimes at Rome and in Greece, sometimes in Syria and at Jerusalem, which gave him an equal knowledge of the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin languages ; sometimes in a'desart and afterwards in the court of the Roman patriarch, and among the ladies of Rome, whom he delighted to instruct : he Translated all the Scriptures into the vulgar tongue, which still forms the basis of the version called the Vulgate. It i. with regret, and not without some doubts of the purity of his Christianity, that he is seen in the number of the.most violent persecutors of the eloquent patriarch, JohnCkrysustom. About this time also, another priest, called Rufinus, translated the books of Origen, Joseph, and Eusebius, and promoted the study of ecclesiastical history in the west. His translation of the first of these authors subjected him to very severe persecutions. About this time flourished the celebrated teacher of Hippo, Augustine, the champion of Catholicism, and the real inventor of the subtle dialectic of theologians. At first the sects of the Donatists and the Pelagians exercised his activity ; he next engaged in the refutation ofthe system of predestination, and of that of the Manicheans, of which he had been the partisan. He contended, taught, and also wrote. When the invasion of the Vandals, who, under Gtnseric came and besieged Hippo, accelerated his death. These people, as well as their king, were Christians of the sect of Arius. Before the death of Augustine, however, a new quarrel em broiled the eastern church. Nestor, patriarch of Constan-"], [348, "318 tinople, assisted by the priest Anastasius, advanced and maintained that Christ, being, at the same time, God and man, it was of Christ, as man, that Mary became the mother, and not of Christ, as God. \" For,\" said he, \" it is absurd to suppose that a human creature, such as Mary, could hava brought forth God.\" Consequently, he called the virgin, mother of Christ, mother of the Son of God; but he refused her the title of mother of God. In other respects, he did not propose to differ, in any thing, from the Catholic faith of Nice, nor even for this reason to admit a double personality in Christ. It is difficult to comprehend the extent to which the animosity of this unhappy war of vain subtleties was carried. The question was, whether one nature in one single person, or two natures and two persons were to be acknow- ledged in Jesus. The court, the empire, the bishops, all classes of Christians were plunged by this question into. horrible convulsions. The third of those councils, called \u0153cumenical, was convoked at Ephesus, where the fiery Cyril, at the head of one party, the Nestorians on another side, and a third party between them, anathematized each other with scandalous inveteracy. The monk Eutychius, the confidant of Cy\u00ab7, who, during the holding of the council, had contributed so powerfully to the condemnation of Nestor, was, seventeen years after, condemned at Constantinople, by another council, for having denied the humanity of Christ. These discussions were prolonged and modified to infinity. The dominant church, which called itself universal, adopted the opinion of the two natures : an opinion wliich was solemnly consecrated in the fourth \u0153cumenical council, held at Chalcedon, where the Roman patriarch, Leo the Great, had, by means of his legates, ths satisfaction to see his primasy* ? The fathers of the council gave, as a reason for this primacy, that ofthe city of Rome, in the empire : Dia to Basileuein. tin Polin, etc. .See the twenty-eighth canon of this council, which, otherwise, declares the patriarch of Constantinople equal in every respect with that of Rome, and only places him in the second rank, because Constantinople is reputed to be the second capital of the emP're, 04"], [349, "319 tanJ doctrine acknowledged. The monopliys.se7., or partisans of a single nature, were, however, far from thinking them selves vanquished, and the disputation only became more violent. Leo died before it was finished. Six years idler, one of his successors, Simplicius, saw all Italy conquered by the barbarians. Odoacer, king of the Heruli, under his eyes and within the walls of Rome, put an end to the empire of the west. The throne of Augustulus was overturned, and the pontifical see, which then occupied the second place, was thus raised to the first, in the opinion of the Romans and the western nations. The controversy on the single or double nature of Jesus, on the single or double personality, was the principle of the division between the the two churches, the east aud the west, the Greek and the Roman. The irritation of minds was past cure, and the famous decree, known by the name of the Henoticon, which Zeno the Isaurian, prepared with an in tention of conciliating the two parties, only accelerated the schism, and rendered it more perceptible. This Zeno dis honoured the imperial throne by his debaucheries and his e.xcesses; and the throne was, as generally occurs, only a sample, a mere striking exhibition, of what existed every where. The public manners were as different frotia those of the first Christians, as the doctrine of the theologians had become different from that of the apostles. The blow recently experienced by the Roman pontiff, in a separation which restricted him to his patriarchate ofthe west, where he was tormented and . menaced by so many Arians, was a little softened by the conquest made by his see about this epoch of Clods, the king of the Franks, who was converted to the Roman faith by his wife, a zealous Christian ; by a great battle which he believed he had gained by a miracle, and by bishop Remi. Since the baptism of that prince, the powerful empire founded by him has remained attached to the Romaa patriarch. Nevertheless, in these early times, the attach ment was not such as to prevent Clovis in Gaul, and Theodoric in Italy from treating patriarchs, bishops, and clerks very roughly."], [350, "320 .About the year 51S, Justin, emperor of the east, who had reasons for humbling the patriarch of Constantinople, who exalted himself too much at pleasure, conceived the idea of reconciling the two churches, in order thus to give the primacy to the Roman pontiff: but he only succeeded in some detached attempts, which completed the acrimony of the mass of the eastern church. Here we may notice au instance of what has been said above, that the proximity of the imperial throne at 'Constantinople, was as fatal to the consequence of the patriarch of that city, as the distance of this throne was favourable to the patriarch of Rome, Jus- tinian, who succeeded Justin, followed his example in respect ofthe preference given to Occidental Catholicism overOriental Catholicism -, and by his impolitic and precipitate measures, drove an innumerable multitude of his subjects to despair. They saw renewed among the christians ofthe Grcelc empire, what had been seen a century and a half before, and what, at the revocation of the edict of Nantes, was seen among the Calvinists of France. The persecuted monophysites fled be- yond the frontiers of the empire, and rilled .'.byssinia, Nubia, Persia, and Armenia. Several patriarchs were established in these different countries, and have remained there independent unto our days. The principal head of the monophysites of the east, during this disastrous period, was a very active monk, Jacob Baradeas, who was the soul of the sect, organized it, separated it for ever from the rest of the church, and established bishops and a patriarch at Antioch. Since this time the christian church is divided into three great nations, which have each their pastors, but do not communicate with each other : the Romans, the Greeks, and the Jacobites. The latter, particularly inimical to the Greeks, were, half a eentury later, a powerful assistance to Mahomet and to the caliphs his successors. What Basil had do'ne for the monks of the east, Benedict undertook with much more success, and with more salutary views, for those of the west. He became the sounder of the cader of the Benedictines, to whom society and the sciences, as well as the Roman church, have had so great and so fee-"], [351, "321 quent obligations. The precept of Basil has scarcely pro duced any but ignorant and fanatic cenobites. That of Benedict has produced a multitude of useful men who have improved a part of Europe, and courageously carried culture and knowledge into the most barbarous countf-ies. A part of Gaul, of England, and Germany has been civilized by them, aud snatched from a gross idolatry to embrace a purer, milder worship, which only requires men to love each other and adore their Creator. The ignorance of the monks of the east contributed greatly to keep up the spirit of sects and divisions among them ; as the strict subordination of those of the west contributed, perhaps, on its side, to the obedience to the head ofthe church, which was gradually established there. Justinian, to whose reign we are indebted for the fine code of laws which bears his name, and for the reformation ofthe Calendar by Denis the Small, did not deserve so well of reli gion, as of jurisprudence and chronology. He fed and fomented a sorry quarrel which was raised respecting three chapters ofthe acts of the council of Calcedon. The weak Vigilius, who filled the see of Rome, was ordered to Con stantinople by the emperor, to condemn these three un fortunate chapters. Vigilius, hesitating between the respect he owed to a council, and the obedience he owed to the emperor, at first declared for the chapters, afterwards he condemned them, then he retrarted, displeased all parties, and concluded by being exiled. This ouly proves that, at this period, the popes were very submissive to the authority of the emperors. When Justinian, through the valour ofthe ce lebrated Belisarius, had reconquered a great part of Italy, he established a superior officer of the empire at Ravenna, under the title of Exarch, to whom the bishops of Rome were obedient, as to a lieutenant of the emperor. The kings of the Goths, and other barbarians, when they found them* selves masters of the city of Rome, treated the popes as their subjects; they also frequently sent them to Constantinople to negotiate for them. However, from that time the immense X"], [352, "322 pretensions of that see may be observed to break forth. Pelagius, who filled it towards the close of the sixth century, disputed with the patriarch of Constantinople John, called the Faster, for the title of \u0153cumenical or universal bishop. After Pelagius, Gregory, surnamed the Great, did the same. At that time, and almost at once, the popes saw the arms of Belisarius employed in the west in the extirpation of the Arians ; and the king of the Visigoths, R.ecaredus, the king of the Suevi in Spain, Thcodimir, and Agilulphus, king of the Lombards, who then entered victorious into Italy, all place themselves on the side of the Roman communion. The Anglo-Saxons themselves, who after the invasion of England, had nearly stifled Christianity in it, soon complaisantly fol lowed the example of their king Ethelbert, who became a Roman Catholic at the persuasion of the eloquent Augustine, a benedictine monk. Thus finishes the second period, in which the patriarchal system is developed and strengthened. The bishops of the great cities sought to raise themselves above all the others, from the time that the first ecclesiastical dignities became lucrative and honourable employments. While the church was militant, its humble pastors, strangers to ambition, were distinguished only by their piety. When it was triumphant, the face of things chungcd. Intrigue and favour disposed of places ; their manners became dissolute. St. Jerome, who knew Rome so well, and the practices of its clergy, paints them in odious colours in several of his writings, and con stantly calls this city by the opprobrious name of Babylon."], [353, "323 THIRD PERIOD. MON.IRCHY. (From Mahomet to Hildebrand. From 604 to 1075. J The Authority of the Roman See becomes predominant in the West, both in spiritual and temporal Matters. JIN the preceding period, we have seen a multitude of the northern nations fall on the Roman empire, who, conquerors, at length, of the famous legions who had conquered the world, carried their exploits so far as to destroy the western empire entirely, and to weaken that of the east. The com mencement of this, is marked by an invasion nearly similar, but of southern people, and, consequently, of manners and character very different from the first. The arms of these new conquerors were also destined to overthrow one of the seats of the empire, the only one remaining at that time. In fact, in the course of time, the empire of the east was de stroyed by the sectaries of Mahomet ; and the Arabs, whom this prophet had raised to the highest point of religious and political fanaticism, penetrated in the west, through Spain, to the centre of Gaul. \u25a0 Mahomet died master of Arabia and a part of Syria, after having founded a religion and a state, intimately united with each other, upon the adoration of one God, all-powerful and individual. With a few simple dogmas, which satisfied all the wants of the spirit of these ardent and rude men, the successors of the prophet, under the title of caliphs, extend ed their conquests, and governed their vast states with great moderation and wisdom. They tolerated all the sects of y2"], [354, "324 Christians, whe passed in their eyes for the worshippers ofa very great prophet, the precursor of their own. But they chiefly connected themselves with the Jacobites, and other Oriental sects, whose inveterate hatred against the Greeks and Romans was a wonderful aid to Islamism. These Chris tians increased in peace under their new masters, and spread into Persia, India, Tartary, and as far as China. While the storm of growing Islamism was gathering on the southern fronties of the empire, Phocas, its unworthy chief, -'disgusted it by his debaucheries and his cruelties. Heraclius, who succeeded him, did more for the good of his subjects, but as little for the safety of the empire. The most important affair in his reign was that of the religious opinion which has been called Monothclism, or the doctrine of a single will. They had long contended for the two persons of Jesus, theu for his two natures; at length, having agreed that he had two natures, a question was raised, whether each nature also had its peculiar will, and if Jesus had, in fact, had two wills, one as God, and the other as man ; or if he had only had a single one, considering the close union of his two natures I The emperor determined in favour of the latter opinion : he made monothelism triumphant, which was vigorously supported by Sergivs, patriarch of Constantinople, but reprobated by the ancient Sophronius, patriarch of Jerusalem, he who died at the moment iu which the Saracens made themselves masters of his see. These opinions on the single or double will of Jesus Christ, also disturbed the christian society for a long time. Heraclius published his edict called Ekthe, in vain ; as did Constans II. the edict known by the name of Type, ten years after. This new emperor, however, showed himself very severe against the distur bers of the church. The proud Pope Martin I. died ia the exile into which Constans had sent him. This rigour calmed the ardour of the most violent disputants. Constantine, called the Bearded, at length assembled, at Constantinople, the sixth, of the \u0153cumenical councils, in which monothelism and all its partisans, even to the Roman Pontiff i/ongrtus,"], [355, "325 long dead, nn .who had appeared favourable to the opinion of one will, were anathematized. The monothelites of the empire, exasperated by this condemnation, took re fuge amohg the Saracens, who allowed them to establish themselves peaceably in the solitudes of Libanus, where they still subsist under the name of Maronites. The emperor, who had himself convoked this council, presided in it as supreme head of Christianity. The patriarch of Constantinople was seated at his right hand, and the legates of Rome on his left. The losses which the church had sustained in the east, dur ing more than half a century, by the conquests of the Saracens, redoubled the attention of the Roman pontiffs to repair these losses by new acquisitions in the west. Besides, the Mussulman scymetar, which had struck such terror into all the christian states of this party, was the cause that their mass had remained more united, aud had drawn themselves closer round him whom they had by degrees accustomed themselves to look up to as their head. The papal throne has greater obli gations to Mahomet and his successors than is believed. But to consolidate an empire in the west, in which the temporal concerns should be grounded on the spiritual, the only soldiers necessary to the Pope, were zealous, eloquent, indefatigable missionaries ; and it was in England, at that time devout and Catholic, that he sought apostles capable of combating idola try with success among the Saxons and otherGerman nations j as well as in the vast monarchy ofthe Franks. Columbanus,Gal lus, and Kilian, were drawn from the cloisters of Ireland to go and preach to the nationsof the continent. Theyfound a power ful protector in Pepin of Herstal. The Anglo-Saxon Willibrod laboured, at the same time, and under the same auspices, in the conversion of the Frisons and Flemings. The Roman pontiffs loaded these missionaries with respect and caresses. Gregory II. after gaining in this manner the English monk Winfreid, known for having been the apostle of Germany, under the name of Boniface, made him swear fealty and homage to the see and church of Rome: he then sent him, provided with magnificent letters, to all princes and bishops, to labour for the interest of Rome, among the Hessians, the Thurin-"], [356, "326 gians, the Franks, the Bavarians, and the Saxons. But what Christianity did all these envoys preach to the people ? Obe- dience to the Pope was the principal dogma : to endow and enrich the church, the monasteries, and the clergy, was the sure road, indicated by them, to salvation, the unfailing means of redemption from all crimes. It must, however, be also noticed that these missionaries brought some knowledge and some civilization amongst the barbarians they converted , and if their instruction was not exempt from all interest and all superstition, it nevertheless was much superior to the rude mythology and idolatrous worship of the north. But of all the religious divisions, the most violent, and that which produced the most dreadful tumults, was that concerning the worship of images, and with which the eighth, pentury of the church was destined to be afflicted. Thisdjspo- sition to honour the images of holy personages, whether paint- ings or statues, had long existed among Christians. It had been sometimes considered as a pious disposition, sometimes as a superstition, sometimes as an indifferent thing. In the west, particularly, where the priests had so deal with so many barbarians and uncultivated people, images were of won- derful use to captivate their senses, and excite them to devo- tion. The monks had applied themselves to painting and sculpture, rude, but sufficient for these times, and had be- come possessed of a very lucrative commerce in images. Besides those with which they decorated their churches, and to which they did not forget to ascribe miraculous virtues, attracted both the multitude and offerings. Thisis enough to -.make it obvious how much the clergy, from its head to the roost humble clerk, must be attached to images and to the worship yvhich was offered to them. The emperor Leo, the Isaurian, with the most upright intentions, prohibited them. He soon found the consequence of attacking the interest of those who have the power of acting upon consciences. Insur- rections and revolts followed. Blood streamed on all sides. The emperor pessed for the antichrist come to destroy reli- gion ; so much had the ideas of this pure and sublime religion"], [357, "327 been already vitiated ! It was in vain that the emperor con voked councils, and deposed his patriarch : he lost all his consequence in them, all peace, the exarchate of Ravenna, and the rest of his power in the west. His partisans were anathematized, and marked with the stamp of heresy under the title of iconoclastes ; his successors found themselves in volved ir. inextricable embarrassments until theambitiousJrf/tf, greedy of popularity, had restored to tho multitude their dear images, and had even found a true cross for them to adore. . tt On occasion of this long war of the images, the popes threw themselves under the protection ofthe Lombard princes, and afterwards of the French Pepin the Short, on whose head, the complaisant Zachary, by his decision, secured the crown he had usurped, under the pretence that he was more worthy of it than the unfortunate Childe ric dethroned by Pepin. Thus far extended the caprice ofthe Isaurian against the images of saints. The popes then made an important step towards the right, which, in the end, they arrogated to themselves, of disposing of crowns. They connected themselves with the mo narchs of the Franks ; Stephen III. successor of Zachary, called Pepin to his assistance against the Lombards. Pepin flew thither, vanquished, and made a present ofthe conquered territory, and an effective kingdom to the pontiffs who had assisted him in preserving his crown. From hence dates the sovereign power of the popes over a portion of Italy. The son of Pepin, that Charles who was truly worthy of the surr name of the Great, who was an enlightened man in an age. ot darkness, had also occasion to go to the assignee of Pope Adrian I. against these Lombards. He destroyed their dor mination, and confirmed the donation of his father in savour of the Holy See; a few years astsr he was crowned at Rome bv the grateful pontiff, and proclaimed Roman emperor of ti.e west. Thus, after an extinction of upwards of three ceu^ turies, was restored a phantom of the empire of the C\u00e6sars, .ihich still subsists, but more feeble than ever, ia thedignity, me almost rajfl, cs:he Emperors of Germany."], [358, "328 Charles did not confine his zeal for the church of Rome to <fce extermination of the Lombards : he also endeavoured to exterminate theancient worship of Irmensul among the Saxons, and with this view waged a bloody war against them, which lasted two and thirty years. His only offence against the papal orthodoxy was that of not being favourable to the worship of images, which he proscribed. He strove to repress the disor- ders of the clergy, and to introduce knowledge among them ; a difficult task, in which Paul the deacon, and Alcuin immor talized themselves by seconding the intentions of their prince. In other respects, Charlemagne governed the church, as mak ing a part of his state, as a legislator, as a sovereign. He also strengthened the line of demarcation which separated the Latin church from the Greek, by causing it to be declared in a council which he held at Aix-la-Chapellc, that the Holy Ghost proceeded equally from the Father and Son : a dogma held in horror by the good Orientals, who assert that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father alone. But the prince who had exalted the Pope so high, died, and with him ceased the vigour and judgment necessary to restrain them, and hinder them from, rising still higher. Louis, so unhappily known by the name of Debonnaire, was the weak son of a great man, and the most unfortunate of fathers. He \u25a0was seen doing penance on his knees before the prelates of his kingdom. And what triumph ; what a prospect opened for the time to come, to the eyes ofthe artful Gregory IV. when he saw the three rebellious sons disputing over the spoils of their father, take him for the judge of their differences, and thus acknowledge him as the sovereign arbiter of crowned heads! Here begins the period at which the Roman\" epis copacy really became a court ; and at which the court of Rome laboured most actively for the incomprehensible in crease of power to which it arrived. Shortly after, on occa sion of a difference between an archbishop of Rheims and a bishop of Laon, his nephew, whose bad conduct he wished to restrain, appeared, for the first time, those false de cretals, the collection of wliich were attributed to one i"], [359, "329 Isidore of Seville, probably an imaginary personage, and which as is believed, were fabricated at Mayence, under the direc- tion of some bishop devoted to Rome. The historical blun- ders and contradictions sound in them, make their evident7 falsity very apparent. But their authority was too well esta- blished in these ages of ignorance, particularly when Pope Nicholas I. had formally recognized them as authentic. Their principal object was to weaken the authority of the metropo- litans, to withdraw the bishops from their discipline, and to make them resort immediately to Rome : in a word, to establish the spiritual monarchy of the popes without reserve. The bishops also sound it more to their advantage than being su- perintended and restrained by censors in their immediate vi- cinity, tind beingalso as jealous of making their rights respected as the archbishops were: besides, all accusations might be easily stifled at Rome by presents and intrigue. The same opinions as the bishops entertained with respect to the arch- bishops, was also entertained by all the inferior clergy, the monks, &c. with respect to the bishops. All preferred resort- ing immediately to Rome, to a more severe and a more pe- netrating jurisdiction in their neighbourhood. All therefore laboured with ardour to increase the immediate power of the popes, who very politely gave way to it. The princes, on theirside, also accommodated themselves to these false decre- tals. They were so pleased to humble the chief of their pre- lates.and dreaded seeing their metropolitans acquire too much authority in their states. It appeared to them preferable to yield an authority still greater to a foreign pontiff, whose vi- cinity did not throw them into the shade, and whom they were besides accustomed to consider as a temporal prince, their colleague. A woeful experience has, in the end, con- vinced more than one prince how deceitful this policy was; but when they would have applied a remedy to it, the evil had become incurable : by irritating it they only increased it, and their resistance thus contributed, as much as their acqui escence, to the establishment ofthe papal monarchy."], [360, "330 Since the commencement of the religion, every century, every generation had seized some old or new idea belonging to this religion, but obscure and indeterminate at first, to model, to finish, to fix, and, as it may be said, to strike it into current money bearing the stamp of the time and opinion. In this ninth century the Eucharist came in turn. It had al- ways been allowed that the body and blood of Jesus Christ had been present in the bread and wine during the celebration of this mystery. But how were they present ? with, or in the bread and wine ? Was it the same body as was born of the Vir- gin ? And how was this body born without injury to her \u2022virginity .? Should unleavened or leavened bread be used? Ought laymen to receive the wine, ot only the bread ? These important questions exercised principally the subtle dialectic of the monks; and Radbert, a Bencdectine, o'f Corvey, in Westphalia, appears to have been him who gave to the doctrine of the Eucharist, the form which was afterwards adopted in the \"Roman church. Two of his opponents, much more reason- able and better informed than him, Ratramus, and the cele- bret'jd Scotus-Erigena, argued in favour of an opinion wliich was nearly the same as that promulgated afterwards by Luther. This century also witnessed vehement disputes on Predestina- tion. Some were for it, and others against it, while a third party insisted on two, one for evil, and another for good. The popes, once acknowledged judges, generally decided in favour of those who appeared most submissive, and most devoted to their see ; or, for the opinions which most resembled their own. In all cases, they gained by these dissensions. Every thing which occasioned a division served to establish their em- pire ; sect against sect ; bishops against archbishops ; monks and priests ; clerks and laymen ; all were turned to their ad- vantage. The old political adage was nevermore assiduously put in practice. At length, it was thought necessary to bring the Greek church and its bishops, who had been so long disjoined from the Latin church, to acknowledge the supremacy of the latter, and of its head ; or, if not, it was proper to cast th\u00abm out of 3"], [361, "331 the communion, to separate from them, and to declare the Latin church the only universal one. The learned Photius, who filled the see of Constantinople, at the same time that Nicholas I. filled that of Rome, was not a man to yield to such claims, nor to suffer himself to be terrified by menaces. Both prelates were obstinate, excommunicated each other, and concluded by each keeping the title of universal bishop. .But from that time the schism was completed, and it has not since been possible to reconcile the two churches. However, when the Saracens assailedSicily andCalabria, and thePope thought he might have occasion for the assistance of the emperor of the cast, he showed himself a little more moderate towards the patriarch. In the west, the excessive weakness of the last princes of the race of Charlemagne, and that of the king of France, Charles the Bald, who humbled himself so much as publicly to make magnificent presents to Pope John VIII. to obtain the imperial crown, completed the consolidation pf the power of, these pontiffs. But in proportion as the claims of the see of Rome were raised, they could not fail to make the princes who were in vested with the imperial dignity, averse to the rights to which these claims were principally directed. Then began long and obstinate dissensions between the Emperors of Germany and the popes. These excommunicated, anathematized, and de posed the emperors, and stirred up and excited their own people and other princes, both Germans aud foreigners, against them. The emperors revenged themselves by arms ; they imprisoned and deposed the popes, and created anti-popes. The temporal chief and the spiritual chief, at variance and making the keenest attacks on each other, began to form the principal groupe in the western history. Their parties Were distinguished by the names of the Ghibellines and the Guelphs, which have become so famous. Around these two adversaries were placed the kings of France, Hungary, England, and Sicily the Normans, Danes, and Poles, who united and fought obsti- -?rely, sometimes against one party, sometimes against the"], [362, "332 other. In this struggle, the temporal princes had every thing to lose, and the popes nothing : for when they had lost their possessions, they still retained the all-powerful empire of opinion, and the vicar of Jesut Christ always found princes in plenty who bent the knee to him, and of bishops who sub missively sought investiture from his hands. From the time that the Roman pontiffs had reached this height of power and glory, the holy light which had adorned the heads of their humble predecessors, grew daily fainter, and, at length, disappeared entirely. All the vices of courts, and of the most corrupt courts in the times of barbarism, ap peared unchecked in that of the successor of St. Peter. One pope who had been the personal enemy of his predecessor, disinterred him, instituted a process against the corpse, caused its head and hand to be cut off, and then thrown intp thcTyber. During upwards of thirty years the prostitute Theodora and her two daughters, no less prostitutes than herself, governed the pontiffs of whom they were the concubines, and, through them, the Christian church ; they disposed of the papacy, and invested their bastards or their lovers with it; imposture and murder were amusement to them ; thus preluding the atrocity and obscenity of the reign of Borgia, which, four centuries after, crowned the work. To blind the eyes ofthe nations .to such usurpations and turpitude, the popes had re course to ignorance and superstition. The monks, their faith ful militia, as degenerate as their employers, served them to their wishes in this work of darkness. This century became the most barbarous of all those of the modern natiops, and, in history, still bears the dishonourable epithet of the age as ignorance, which is very justly given to it above all others. During its course no heresy arose : a heretic is ono who thinks different from orthodoxy ; at this time they did not think at all.

JL h e see of Rome had not yet been silled by any pope who, like Hildebrand, united all the qualities calculated to extend its power. Imperious, ardent, inflexible, but profoundly dissimulating, he began by procuring his. election without the approbation of the emperor ; he then wrote to him in sub missive terms. Strong in the division of the German princes, the support of the Norman dukes, but principally in the per fect abandonment, with which the Countess Matilda of Tus cany, yielded herself to him, he, in his first actions shewed what might be expected from his reign, vigorously contesting with the emperor the right of investiture, which he main tained belonged to him. At the same time he put in execution the most politic plan which had ever been conceived by any pope, and which would furnish the Floly See with as many subjects as there were priests in the christian world, by insu lating all these priests from their respective countries, and subjecting them without participation, to the head of the church: I mean that he commanded, in the most positive manner, the celibacy of the priests. Hitherto this sort of abstinence had not been practised as a duty, except by the monks. The German clergy, who were much displeased with this procedure, joined their discontent to that of the emperor,"], [365, "N 335 and, in a council assembled at Worms, in which this monarch presided, Gregory VII. was declared deposed from the pon tificate. In the articles of accusation it was, among other . things, imputed to him, that he was an apostate monk, (falsus monachus), a sorcerer, (divinaculus, somniorum, pro digiorumque conjector, tnanifestus necromanticus), an incen diary, a sacrilegist, a murderer, a liar, an abeitor of adul teries and incests.* This act of accusation, as well as his condemnation and his life, which had been composed for this purpose, and in the above style, were Sent to him by the em peror, in order that he might submit himself. Gregory, on his side, had also convoked a council, at Rome, and the im perial envoy had the courage to deliver his dispatches to him, inthe assembly. Gregory took them with a calm air, caused thein to be read in open council, and heard them without the least alteration ; then, with the same countenance, he col lected the votes of the bishops : on their judgment he declared those of the council of Worms suspended, excommunicated Henry who had presided at it, condemned this prince to the loss of the imperial dignity, and freed all his subjects from. their oath of fidelity, foibidding all persons whatever to obey him in future, under the same penalty of excommunication. Philip, king of France, had already been threatened with anathema, by Hildebrand. Spain, Bohemia, Hungary, and other Christian countries had been already harassed by his claims and terrified by his menaces. The thunders of Gregory did not strike in vain. Henry, abandoned by his subjects, was obliged to send his crown and his decorations to the arro gant priest, and to go in person to prostrate himself before him. In the month of December, he fasted on bread and water, for three days and three nights, barefooted, in a court. After this penance, he received absolution for the fault he had committed, in judging too well of the person of Hildebrand, and too ill of the power of superstition and fa- naticism, in an age such as his. * Phil.

The reconciliation which followed was not sincere : Gregory did not cease to oppose another emperor to the emperoT, as the latter opposed an anti-pope to him. Henry, having, at length assembled an army, passed into Italy, took Rome, and would also have got possession of the person of the Pope, who shut himself up in the castle of St..A.ngelo, if Robert Guiscard had not hastened from Naples to his deliverance. Two years after, Hildebrand died at Salernum, without having testified any desire to be reconciled to the emperor. The firstidea of reconquering Palestine from the Arabs and the Turks, who then began to show themselves, by an army of Christians, is attributed to Gregory VII. However this may be, it was shortly after his death that this great move ment, which cost Europe so much blood, but which procured it some knowledge, and accustomed its people to make com mon cause with each other, to sight together, and to consider themselves as a mass of confederate states, animated by a common interest, began to be effected. In an armament of the whole of Christianity it will be obv ious that the Pope, recognized as the supreme chief of this holy army, in which every warrior enrolled himself as the soldier of the church, must obtain an increase of his authority. The powers and the activity of the princes being wasted in Asia, left him a more open field in Europe. The church was enriched by the sale of so many possessions, which then took place, and by the legacies. of pious warriors who died in the Holy Land. Powerful or ders of knighthood were established, and consigned their swords with their possessions to the church. On the other hand, amidst all their losses, the princes saw their great vassals lose still more, and become enfeebled without resource. These few observations will suffice to show the influence whicli the crusades had on the constitution and social culture of Europe. To Gregory VII. may also be ascribed the origin of in dulgences,, of those pardus for another life,, whatever crimes-"], [367, "337 might be committed in this, of those bills Of exchange oft heaven, for which, in the end, the popes paid so dearly on earth, and the traffic in which, carried to a disgusting excess, became the first accidental cause of Luther's reformation. * The crusaders who died on the field of battle, and in the midst of infidels, without priests or confessors, were, according to the adopted system, in want of such immunities, the use of which in this case had an appearance of reason.

The object of this sketch is only to indicate rapidly the different mutations which have super vened in the constitution of the christian society. . Gregory VII. had completed the papal omnipotence. His successors, who were able during upwards of two centuries to preserve it at the height to which he had raised it, and who sometimes exercised it with a violence which is scarcely cre dible at the present day, sought only the means of sanctioning and establishing it upon more solid bases. It was not enough that this omnipotence existed in fact, it was also necessary that it should appear to exist by right, and to be founded on a positive legislation. The decretals of the false Isidore had already been of marvellous efficacy, but they were anxious to add more to them ; and among other celebrated works com posed with this view, it will be sufficient to name here the celebrated Decrctum of the monk Gratian, and the Livre des. Sentences de Pierre Lombard, archbishop of Paris, which gave the final blow to the authority of princes as well as to that of the bishops, and reduced the despotism of Hildebrand into a methodical and pious system of canonical right, which, from that time, became the mpst sacred article ofthe Christianity of the west. Books were not, however, sufficient alone: they wanted interpreters, living organs, guardians who should sup port the doctrine. The mendicant orders were created; and to them was intrusted the care of training and cultivating the vine of the Lord : dangerous depositaries, who soon divided, contended, and, frequently, gave ample employment to the sovereign'pontiffs. The most remarkable of these orders was that of the Dominicans, because with it, and in the same cradle, was born the horrible inquisition, the first action of which was the carnage of several thousands of Albigenses and other Christians, who, in theirsimplicity, imagined they might believe in Christ, without believing in the popes; and the de vastation of the states of Count of Raymond Toulouse, who had tolerated them. The institution of the crusades was then turned from its first direction, and employed by the popes to arm Christians against Christians. Here and there soma 4"], [369, "339 Voices were raised against so many abuses and cruelties, so opposite to the spirit of Christianity ; but they were instantly stifled. Arnold of Brescia, and Peter de Bruys perished in the flames, a punishment, which its resemblance to the fire of hell has caused to be since adopted for all the enemies of the Holy See. Waldo established a small independent sect, in some remote vallies of the Alps, which long escaped perse cutions, but afterwards paid for this good fortune by abun dance of blood and torments. It is therefore with reason that this period is here charac- terized by the term despotism, and that it begins with the reign of Hildebrand. The acts of the papal omnipotence during its course were the humiliation, urged to excess, of all christian princes and people ; rebels supported and encouraged every where against the legitimate authority, when that ofthe Pope was in opposition to it; sovereigns dispossessed and excom- municated as well as their subjects ; crowns taken away, given, sold, according to the interests or passions of the pontiff; the bishops and clergy ofall the Catholic countries subjected to his will, receiving from him the investiture of their charges, and holding them almost exclusively of him : so that the hierarchy every where formed a state within a state, under the dominion ofa foreign despotic, chief, who, by its means, dis- posed of all the consciences, and of nearly all the riches ofa country. The means employed by the court of Rome to sup- port so many usurpations were, besides the fictitious histori- cal proofs which imposed on the ignorance of these times, effrontery, perseverance, uniformity of design, which were always superior to the weakness and disunion of their oppo- nents ; the celibacy of the clergy ; auricular confession ; the establishment of the mendicant orders, and that of the in- quisition-; the crusades undertaken by the christian princes, .under the authority of the church ; the immense sums which all the countries of the west poured into the pontifical trea- sury, under different names, tithes, Peter's pence, taxes, dispensations, &c. the indulgences and jubilees; the doc- trine of purgatory, which they employed as a support ; that z 2"], [370, "340 of transubsfantiation ; the worship of saints, of relics, and mi7' raculous images, pilgrimages; in fine, every thing which is capable of transferring religion to the senses of mankind, and, consequently, of nourishing and exciting fanaticism, by de priving the mind of all right to examine and to weigh. This picture, which, assuredly, is not that of tin- holy and be- neficent religion of Christ, bm truly that of the hierarchical con- stitution of the church in the west, in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, cannot appear exaggerated even to the most zealous defenders of popery. Histury is entitled to trace it, at the present day, with the same fidelity it exercised in for- mer times in collecting its scattered lineaments. Every thing- is written : the trust confided to time has been transmitted to us, and the bitter truth can neither be disguised nor doubted. Besides, it cannot be dissembled what talents, perseverance, policy, and courage were required to bring to perfection, to prop, and to maintain this admirable edifice of the papal domination : an immense colossus which oppressed' the earth with its weight, and derived all its strength- froiw the opinion, so- well establishes that it reigned there inthe name of heaven. When a new development of the constitution of the church or of its dogmas has been indicated in this sketch, the events are no longer to be ascribed to it. It must, on- ly, be recollected, that according to the natural disposition of minds amidst such constraint and Confusion, philosophy could be no other than theology, and theology could only be a labyrinth of sophisms and subtleties. The activity of the finest geniuses at these times, not being able to take another direction, their powers served only to engage them in difficul- ties continually more inexplicable, and to draw closer the knots in which they wore embarrassed. A dominant system of theology, a supple dialectic, fruitful in distinctions and- divisions, and which supplied the means of being right at any price whatever, was required. That of Aristotle, disfigured and wrong interpreted, appeared perfectly suitable to this purpose. From that time it was found in the schools iuti-"], [371, "341 i mately incorporated with theology, and became almost as sacred as it. she logic of the preceptor of Alexander, (Oh ! \u2022unheard of destiny !), became one of the firmest supporters ot the throne of Hildebrand. Thus arose the scholastic phi losophy, to which, notwithstanding its absurdities, the human mind was, at first, indebted for some progress. Its first apostles were Lanjranc, B.oscelin, Abelard, and his intolerant rival Bernard. If these times were clouded with the darkness of superstition, they nevertheless furnished, in addition to the above names, those of Albert, called the Great, of Thomas Aquinas, of John Duns-Scotus, of Roger Bacon, and of Ray mond Lully : which, notwithstanding, did not at the satne period, hinder the angels from transporting the house of the holy virgin from Palestine into Dalmatia, and afterwards to Lorretto, or the Emperor Rodolph of Hapsburgh from being obliged formally to acknowledge the sovereignty of Pope Nicholas III, over the exarchate of Ravenna. SECOND SECTION. The Consequence of the Ro:r.an See decreases ; its Authority suffers. Knowledge revives ; the Church feels the Want of a Reformation. When7 despotism is displayed with the greatest violence, it, at length, meets with some obstacle from which it receives its first wound. Intoxicated with his authority, with a power which for so many<enturies had sported with crowned heads, the haughty Boniface VIII. animated by a personal resent ment against the king of France, thought he might treat him with the despotic insolence of his predecessors. But he found in Philippe-le- Bel a firmness worthy of the chief of a great people. Notwithstanding the second crown which Boniface had lately added to the Tiara, and the imperial ornaments with which he had been publicly invested at Rome, Philip ifound means to cause him to be apprehended in the midst ->f"], [372, "342 ibis states, by a few soldiers under the conduct of the chan cellor Nogaret, who was the soul of the whole enterprize. Boniface died, perhaps from grief for this affront, a few weeks after. This check would have been of no consequence to the papacy ; but the king of France, after the short ponti ficate of the successor of Boniface, having, by a singular good fortune, the disposal of the votes of the sacred college, caused the Tiara to be offered to a French bishop, upon the express condition that he should reside in France. The delighted prelate fell into the snare, promised what was required of him, was elected Pope by the name of Clement V. and fixed his see in France, and then at Avignon. He soon found that Rome, destined to be twice mistress of the world, would not give up its privilege to any other city. What the emperors had lost by the translation of their residence, the popes also lost by the translation of theirs ; and Avignon was to therfi, what Byzantium had been to the others. Perhaps still worse ; for besides the translation of the see, always disadvantageous in itself, Clement V. found himself on a foreign territory, and in the power of Philip. This captivity of the popes lasted about seventy years. It introduced a principle of destruction into the papacy, Afterwards this colossus moved, lived, languished, and, now and then, made some convulsive efforts ; but, as it is reported of certain poisons, the slow action of which underlines secretly, and breaks out at a fixed term, so the papacy was from that time attacked by a secret languor which allowed it only a certain period of an existence always declining. The kings of France thus taught the other potentates how they might brave the common despot, and render his thunders vain, by securing his person. Clement V. was soon com pelled solemnly to annul all that Boniface had dared to do against Philip, and to institute a process ?.gainst his memory, in which he was charged with the most horrible crimes. Ho was obliged to sign the destruction of the Templars whom Philip had sworn to ruin. In a word, during this long suc cession of years, the popes were only instruments in the hands'"], [373, "343 Ofthe French monarchs. It was them who excommunicated, placed under interdict, deposed their rivals, and directed the holy artillery of the pontiff, as far as it was their interest ; leaving it at liberty in other respects against the remainder of the christian states, such as Venice for example, which then had violent disputes with the pontiffs. The other princes, however, did not fail shortly to perceive this management, and to make it \"noticed by their people. The bishops and the clergy of other countries, awakened from the long slumber of their passive obedience, scorned a master who was no longer his own. The delusion ofthe papacy began to be dissipated, and men's eyes were opened by degrees. Rome revolted-f i-t became sometimes the prey of the emperor, and sometimes of another conqueror; it had also its intervals of liberty, during which the fine dream was conceived of restoring it to its ancient independence and its ancient splendor. A multi tude of petty tyrants divided the states of the successor of \u2022St. Peter. The Pope was not even sovereign in hb new residence; and when, afterwards, he acquired the sove reignty of Avignon, he was not the less blockaded and straitened in this small district by the French, who were his masters as before. It may readily be imagined that incalculable \u25a0evils must result to the Holy See from this position. The court of the pontiff had long been the most brilliant of all, that of which luxury consumed the most wealth. Among the Cares to which the popes submitted, one of the most pressing was that of enriching their families. Nepotism had been long an enormous burthen to Christianity ; but the rivers of gold which had formerly taken their course towards Rome, did not turn towards Avignon. The princes prohibited the exportation of a currency which would have gone, in part, into the coffers of the king of France. The latter allowed his prisoner only a very moderate tribute, making the clergy of his kingdom bear part ofthe charges of the state, and the expenses of his wars against his neigh bours. Hence the necessity for the popes to hay* recourse te new methods of drawing money from the clei^y and th\u00ab"], [374, "344 people. Indulgences and dispensations were multiplied under all forms, and finished by becoming openly scandal ous: the popes exacted a part of the revenues of the vacant benefices-, and for this reason they left the greater part qf the episcopal sees without incumbents; they exacted a con siderable right, a year's revenue on each change in a see, and for this reason multiplied these changes soas to displease both the flocks and their pastors: thus, in its unfortunate activity, the papal exchequer \\n\\cnte.dfrst-fruits, expectancies, provisions, reservations, taxes of all sorts for the pardon of all crimps, even tbe most shameful. The patience of the people was fatigued ; murmurs arose on all sides ; writers incited by their own conviction, and by the avou.r of princes, published bold works, in which the usurpations of the popes were attacked, and the rights of princes defended against them : it was then that the emperor of Germany thought he might dispense with thp custom of having his election Confirmed by the sovereign pontiff, a custom to which his predecessors had submitted for several generations. A qUarrel which had divided, the Franciscans, and in which the popes had interfered, led to the most disastrous con sequences. The pontifical authority had supported the party evidently the most culpable, and had urged lhe resentment of the party which had the most seducing appearance of sanctify in its favour, to the highest point. The discontented Franciscans, irritated against the popes, alienated the minds of the multitude from them. These good monks and a great number of their partisans regarded the Holy Father, accord ing to the favourite similitude of those times, as the Antichrist : thpy possessed much influence and popularity; their preach ing increased the discredit into which the popes had fallen, and the fermentation which became dangerous to them. But what carried it to its height, was, that the cardinals, divided info two factions, that of the Italians and that of the French, who had become preponderant durin\" the Ion\" re^ sidence of the popes in France, soon afterwards came to ari open rupture, and, with an authority and reasons which ap-"], [375, "345 peared equal, chose, the one, a pope on that side, the other, a pope on this side the mountains. The kings of France had chosen to dispose of the Pope of Avignon: the greater part of the other princes wished to see him at Rome again. Hence this great and scandalous schism which lasted forty years. The church had then two heads, and sometimes three, who, with terror, were seen reciprocally anathema tizing and fulminating excommunications ; using the most revolting abuse ; accusing each other with the most odious vices, and calling each other antichrist, heretic, and usurper. The faithful, astonished, and uncertain, knew not in which ofthe adversaries they were to confide, and generally finished by despising them equally. The assembly of the representatives of the church, the councils, took advantage of this conjuncture to revive the authority which the court of Koine bad deprived them of: those which assembled at Pisa, at Constance, and Basle made and unmade popes, cited them, judged them, made the so much wished-sor reformation ofthe church the order of the day, and proclaimed this principle, long forgotten, and so often anathematized, before and after this period, '* that the council is above the Pope.\" But that which was still more dangerous than all the schisms and all the efforts of the princes against a domination established in ignorance, and on false historical proofs, was the renovation of letters, which, after a total eclipse of nearly two centuries, had already shown, here and there, some glim merings, a faint dawn, and, towards the end of the fourteenth century, began to spread a very vivid lustre. It was already bright, when, at the commencement of this century, Nicholas de Lyre, in the university of Paris, which has done so much in opposition to tbe pretensions of the popes, commented publicly on the text of the scriptures, and, by a learned exegesis, restored the almost-lost knowledge of this common chart of Christians. Marsigli of Padua, Dante, Bocace, Petrarch, created a taste for letters, extended their rising empire, and attacked the papacy with arms, which differed, but were equally capable of striking. The aidour of"], [376, "346 .knowledge, the hesitation, arising from it, the criticism which enlightens it. arose on every side. Universities, re sembling that of Paris, were established in Bohemia, Ger many, Poland, Sweden, and England,. In the latter coun try, the learned Wickliff soon appeared with a literal tran slation ofthe New Testament, and the most powerful argu ments against the Papal government, which he attacked with heroic firmness. Still more courageous, and not less learned, the unfortunate John Huss preached the same doctrine in Bohemia, with much more success, and founded there a formidable sect, which afterwards supported itself by arms, under the intrepid and fortunate Ziska, its military leader. It is known with what greatness of soul the sage of Prague approached the stake, at Constance, to which he was con ducted by the most perfidious fanaticism, in contempt of the imperial safe-conduct and the most sacred promises. His disciple Hieronymus, or Jerome, at the same stake, exhibited the same stoicism as his master. But though the tyrants burned their bodies, the flame could not extinguish thoughts, which, flying with rapidity from one mind to another, every where disseminated the fruitful germs of know ledge and of liberty. Here events are presented to the notice of the historian who seeks only results. He finds himself on a declivity ; gravitation makes him hasten his progress ; every thing flies, every thing disappears behind him, until having reached a riew plain, he sees every thing which has passed so rapidly before his sight, stop, and arrange itself round him. The popes, freed from captivity, and afterwards from the antipapacy of Avignon, believed themselves restored to the happy times of Hildebrand and his successors. At Rome, every thing crept servilely before them; opulence had re turned to their court ; flattery and voluptuousness had rendered them indifferent to the public mind, which, through ignorance, they despised. The most crafty policy, natural to a power sojveak in reality, and strong only by intrigue, by the sole talent of fascinating eyes, was exercised by them"], [377, "347 lo divide the princes and support themselves. There cante no better proof of the perseverance with which this system was scrupulously followed from pope to pope than the \u2022example of \u00c6neas-Sylvius* an ardent reformer of the church under this name, and author of a writing full of spirit, which makes part of the acts of the council of Basle against Eugene IV. Hardly elected Pope himself, under the name of PiuiII. he retracts, in an unambiguous bull, and becomes the most ardent zealot of the prerogatives of his see. At length in difference and a want of all decency, the habit and the effrontery of crimes, appeared in all their loathsomeness at the court of Borgia, Pope, under the name of Alexander VI. The name alone of this scandal to the papacy expresses more than those of Nero and Domitian, under whom Rome had before groaned. Let. it be judged how much such a, pontiff alienated the hearts and minds of a church of which he was the head. The most sincere Catholics were dis heartened and confounded ; they were disgusted at seeing the contributions of the christian world turned to scandalous uses, and the censures of the church in such unworthy hands. Ten years after this pontificate, began that of the frivolous Leo X. a pope-co.xcomb, greedy of pleasures, an enemy to business, a great protector of the arts which procured him gratification, or flattered his vanity. For, in this respect. * Who would have supposed ihat the same man who had spoken the language of reason, at B*sle, and supported the authority of the church .assembled in council against that of the popes, would, a few years after, express himself thus in a bull against whoever should appeal to a council ? \" Execrabilis, et pristinis tempgribus inauditus, tempestati nostri inolemt abusus, ut a Romano Pontifice, J.

The popes pror tected men of talents, while they saw in them only courtiers who sang their praises, or artificers of pleasures, or dancers. When they began to perceive that the light, before which superstition mnst fly, was concealed in the productions of genius, they persecuted, they humbled genius ; they would, have stopped the progress of the flame which they had fanned at first, Leo also, like all his predecessors, pretended to be desirous of making war upon the infidels, and of reconquering the tomb of Jesus Christ, the ordinary pretext for new ex actions. The luxury of his court consumed the whole. At length, he would complete the superb basilick of St. Peter. To supply the means, it was necessary to have recourse to new indulgences. The publication of them caused the im\u00bb patience and indignation which lurked in every corner to burst forth. The reformation, of the consequences of which we are to give an account, followed, and the celebrated church, '' raised so the prince ofthe apostles, was the mass which crush ed the domination of his successors. Who would have .supposed it ? While in the west they cut each others throats to know who should command, who should be master, the head of the church or the head ofthe empire; the' Greeks disputed with the greatest acrimony on this question, that js to say; \" Of what nature was the light seen by the apostles on Tabor ? Was it uncreated or created ? God, or not God ?\" The most noted leaders and adherents of the vanquished and persecuted party, sought refuge in Italy, where they increased the taste for letters. When, shortly after, the seat ofthe Greek empire fell into the power of the Turks, the emigration of learned men to Italy was still greater. These fugitives, who retained nothing but their knowledge, inspired a general taste for their Jansua\u0153"], [379, "349 which was the key of classical antiquity, as well as that of the sacred books. The love of the arts, and thnt of know* ledge warmed all hearts capable of feeling and thinking; the others, faithful to the barbarism and fanaticism of the pre- ceding centuries, formed an irritating opposition, violent in the extreme* One pope had already forbidden the study of mathematics, as dangerous ; now they perceived that the study of Greek and Hebrew would give an insight into the original titles of religion and its ministers ; they thought of prohibiting it. In the universities of Bohemia, England, aud Scotland, and the north of Germany, including Holland, the erudite and serious part of letters, criticism and philosophy, had every where acquired a consistence: in Italy, a more smiling country, among a people more given to pleasures, poetry and the fine arts, had fixed as in a more propitious soil. Happy France united the advantages of both these climates, without, however claiming, in this century, the palm either of poetry or erudition, both of which she has been, in turn, entitled to in subsequent times. While the learned world was in this agitation, violent storms gathered on the political horizon. The young and ambitious Charles had just mounted the imperial throne: Spain, Belgium, a part of Italy, and of the present France, joined to his immense states in Germany, made him the most powerful monarch in Europe. The realization of the pro ject of an universal monarchy in the west, which had never been abandoned by the successors of the C\u00e6sars, and par- *I.eason and truth never want similar opponents. It was of the doc trine protected by them, and of their efforts to propagate it that, the Marquis D'Argens, in his }lislcire de I' esprit humain, (torn. x. p. 380,) said, \"And these are the principles and the belief which hypocritical devotees would still, at this day, extol and bring among us !

The successor of St. Peter also contended for this same monarchy, on other grounds, but with arms which began to lose their temper. The German princes saw with terror, the fate prepared for them : instead of sovereign princes, confederated under one head, they were about to become the simple vassals of the emperor. The free cities were ia dread of the same subjugation. Only Francis I. on the throne of France could oppose the formidable Charles with any effect.

From his Translation of Moshcim's Ecclesiastical History, Vol. iv. p. 31. Edit. 1803. Dr. Mosheim has taken no notice of thecalumnies invent ed and propagated by some late authors, in order to make Luther's opposition to the publication of indulgences, appear to be the effect of selfish and ignoble motives. It may not, therefore, be improper to set that in a true light ; not that the cause of the reformation (which must stand by its own intrin sic dignity, and is in no ways affected by the views or charac ters of its instruments) can derive any strength from this in quiry :\u25a0 but as it may tend to vindicate the personal character of a man, who has done eminent service to the cause of re-? ligion. Mr. Hume, in his History of the Reign of Flenry VIII. has thought proper to repeat what the enemies of the reformation, and some of its dubious and ill-informed friends, have ad vanced, with respect to the motives that engaged Luther to oppose the doctrine of indulgences. This elegant and per suasive historian tells us, that the \"Austin friars had usually been employed in Saxony to preach indulgences, and from this trust had derived both profit and consideration; that Arcemboldi gave this occupation to the Dominicans*; that Martin Luther, an .Austin friar, professor in tbe University of Wittembcrg, resenting the affront put upon, his order, began to preach against the abuses that were committed in the sale of indulgences, and, being provoked by opposition, proceeded even to decry indulgences themselves.\" t It were to be wished that Mr. Hume's candour had engaged him to examine this accusation better, before he had ventured to repeat it. For, \u2022Hume's History of England, under the House ofTudor, vol, i. p. 11?. t Id. ib. p. 120."], [382, "352 in the first place, it is not true that the Austin friars hadheert usually employed in Saxony to preach indulgences. It is well known, that the commission had been offered alternately, and sometimes jointly, to all the mendicants, whether Austin friars, Dominicans, Franciscans, or Carmelites. Nay, from the year 1229, that lucrative commission was principally entrusted with the Dominicans*; and, in the records which re- late to indulgences, we rarely meet with the name of an Austin friar, and not one single act by which it appears, that the Ro- man Pontiff ever named the friars of that order to the office under consideration. More particularly it is remarkable, that for half a century before Luther, (;'. e. from 1450 to 1517), during which period indulgences were sold with the most scandalous marks of avaricious extortion and impudence, we scarcely meet with the name of an Austin friar employed in that service ; if we except a monk named Puhius, who was no more than an underling of the papal questo r Raymond Peraldus ; so far is it from being true, that the Augustin order were exclusively, or even usually employed in that services. Mr. Hume has r.uilt his assertion upon the sole authority of a single expression of Paul Sar pi, which has been abundantly refuted byDe Pricrio.Pallavicini andGraweson,the mortal ene miesof Luther. But it may be alleged, that, even supposing it was not usual to employ thci^ugustin friars inthe propagation of indulgences, yet Luther might be offended at seeing such an important commission given to the Dominicans exclu sively, and that, consequently, this was his motive in oppos ing the propagation of indulgences. To shew the injustice of this allegation, I observe, Secondly. That in the time of Luther the preaching of in dulgences was become such an odious and unpopular matter, that it is far from being probable, that Luther would have been solicitous about obtaining such a commission, either for himself, or for his order. The princes of Europe, with many * See Weismanni, Memorabilia Histori\u00e6 Sacr\u00e6 N. T. p. 1051, lllJ, + See Harjrii Dissertat. de Nonnullis Indulgentiarura, Sasc. xiv. ct xv. Questoribus. p. 381, 3&J7."], [383, "353 bishops, and multitudes of learned and pious men, had opened their eyes upon the turpitude of this infamous traffic : and even the Franciscans and Dominicans, towards the conclusion of the fifteenth century, opposed it publicly, both in their dis courses, and in their writings. * Nay, more, the very com mission which is supposed to have excited the envy of Luther, was offered by Leo to the general of the Franciscans, and was refused both by him and his order, t who gave it over entirely to Albert, bishop of Mentz and Magdeburg. Is it then to he imagined, that either Luther or jhe other Austin friars aspired after a commission of which the Franciscans were ashamed. Besides, it is a mistake to affirm, that this office was given to the Dominicans in general, since it was given to Tettel alone, an individual member of that order, who had been notorious for his profligacy, barbarity, and e.xtortion. But that neither resentment nor envy were the motives that led Luther to oppose the doctrine and publication of indul gences, will appear with the utmost evidence, if we consider, in the third place, \u2014 That he was never accused of any such motives, either in the edicts of the pontiffs of his time, or amidst the other reproaches of the contemporary writers, who defended the cause of Rome, and who were far from being sparing of their invectives and calumnies. All the contem porary adversaries of Luther are absolutely silent on this head. From the year 1517 to 1546, when the dispute about indul gences was carried on with the greatest warmth and animosity, not one writer ever ventured to reproach Luther with these ignoble motives of opposition, now under consideration. I speak not of Erasmus, Sleiden, De Thou, Guicciardini, and others, whose testimony might be, perhaps, suspected of partiality in his favour, but I speak of Cajetan, Hogstrat,De Prierio, Emscr, and even the infamous John Tetzel, whom Luther opposed with such vehemence and bitterness.

Bossuet, to Mr. Hume, and to other abettors of this ill-contrived and foolish story. Either there are no rules of moral evidence, or Mr. Hume's assertion is entirely I might add many other considerations to shew the unrea sonableness of supposing that Luther exposed himself to the rage ofthe Roman pontiff, to the persecutions of an exasperated clergy, to the severity of such a potent, and despotic prince as Charles V. to death itself, and that from a principle of avarice and ambition.
