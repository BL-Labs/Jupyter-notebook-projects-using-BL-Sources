What the Reverend Miles North's vicarage lacked in extent of view was compensated by its snugness. What the house missed in dignity was made up in cosy comfort, and a modest rural picturesqueness. Oxcleeve Vicarage was situated in the cleeve itself, and was at once sheltered and hidden by the wooded banks which rose on either side of the river Bar and of the pubhc road. The last, finding no other means of ingress or egress, had to be content to run by the river. Fir trees, with unusually large holly bushes, pre vailed principally in the cleft of the moor, VOL. II. B"], [14, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 2 which had a background of rocks tufted with broom and bracken, chiefly prized as furnish ing the best fox-earths within many miles. There was ivy in abundance in the cleeve, outrivalling the ferns and heather ; and there were a few fine beech trees close to the water, indicating the character of the climate and soil. There was not another house in the Reverend Miles's parish \u2014 not Barnes Clyffe, not even the house of Mr. Lacy, the sleeping partner in the button business, which had been purposely built in the most romantic situation in order to emulate some old Italian castle perched among crags overhanging a pass in the Apennines \u2014 could vie with the vicarage in the possession of ample protection from the rough moorland wind, and in look ing secluded and tranquil. In its tranquil aspect it was far beyond Mr. Lacy's house of Thorn. That had pepper-box turrets, and a mild attempt at battlements, which, if they meant anything, indicated a dim recollection"], [15, "A MODEL CLERGYMAN AT HOME 3 of the warfare of the Middle Ages, whereas the farmhouse style of the vicarage, its low weather-stained waUs, its heavy irregular thatch-roof \u2014 neither of them much more modern than those of the Court \u2014 its adjoin ing offices, which helped to close in the non descript garden of flowers, vegetables, and orchard trees, in the middle of which the house stood, breathed only of peace and the arts of peace. The Reverend Miles, who allowed himself very httle licence in his course, relaxed his stringency so far as to take a human interest in his garden, and in the solid simple pro priety of his house, which was as free from threadbare shabbiness and resounding empti ness as from pompous pretension and flimsy splendour. He had some knowledge of garden ing and some taste for it, and he prized the rich fruitfulness and floweriness that a little care served to bring forth within his small domain, which formed a great and pleasant contrast to the wild bleakness of the moor without. He B 2"], [16, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 4 had also a liking for the dumb creatures of his stable and yard, noticeable in so grave and reserved a man, though perhaps not so uncommon in natures like his as one is tempted at the first glance to suppose. He kept no hunters, but the moor ponies which he rode and drove on occasions, though they were not Katerfeltos, were as well treated and brought as near to perfection as horseflesh maintained for purely domestic purposes could be. His cows were as scrupulously cared for ; his cocks and hens were examples of handsomely-dealt-with, handsomely con ducted fowls. He always fed his pigeons himself, and did not object to their alighting on his head and shoulders, perhaps remem bering St. John and his rabbit. He culti vated bees, and attended to their prosperity also. Altogether, though Miles North was, in his unresting diligence, coupled with his severity to himself, distinctly a product of the nineteenth century, his menage and garden, even when he was present, had a quaint"], [17, "A MODEL CLERGYMAN AT HOME 5 flavour of Goldsmith and Sterne about it. You looked before you at the old apple and pear trees, the tall hollyhocks, the round cabbages, the red roses and white lihes, and beyond them at the dovecot and beehives, then back at the low thatched house with long benches in front, until you could have beheved that the Vicar of Wakefield in his shovel-hat and gaiters, or Parson Adams with his long clay pipe, would presently appear on the threshold. But as there was a serpent in Eden, so there was a flaw in the decent orderliness of the Reverend Miles's home, and a canker in its wholesomeness. The offence lay in the company of the vicar's cousin, Mr. Tony North. What induced the young clergyman to consent to the scandal nobody could ex actly say, though there were various explana tions vouchsafed on the sole authority of their originators. Some said that in his youth Miles North had been greatly obliged to the parents of his cousin Tony, and was now pay-"], [18, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 6 ing the penalty in the compulsory discharge of a debt of gratitude. Some would have it \u2014 and there was a colour given to both the first and second hypotheses by one circum stance, the Reverend Miles had no nearer surviving relatives appearing on the scene \u2014 that the two men who now diverged so widely in principles, habits, and tastes had as boys been schoolfellows and close companions, and that a hngering recollection of the old tie induced the vicar to let his decorous estab lishment become the refuge of a scapegrace whose sole small chance of reforming the error of his ways and recovering the credit which he had lost lay in the amount of countenance still lent him by one so unlike himself. There were also speculative people who took up the idea that Miles North's en durance of the presence of his cousin Tony was not so much a self-inflicted penance, or a piece of charity, as an act of spiritual pride. In his sacred calling, he, who was strong and resolute in the mauling of his inclinations,"], [19, "A MODEL CLERGYMAN AT HOME 7 would fain cope with the greatest difficulties. He could not submit to be defeated on any count. As St. Christopher had been driven to take service with the devil \u2014 because he would only yield himself bondsman to the strongest \u2014 till he found his true Master, so the vicar of Oxcleeve elected to befriend the polished scamp, the well-bred reprobate, minus conscience and heart, of social life \u2014 one of the most hopeless products of evil \u2014 till the priest could overcome him by the might of his mission. Doubtless there were a few grains of truth in each of the different suppo sitions which professed to give a reason for the vicar's apparent inconsistency in permit ting Tony North to hve with him. It need hardly be said that in the single combat the Reverend Miles came off second best ; that all his Christian, manly, and gentle manly weapons of forbearance, and silent ap peal to the last remnant of good feeling in the moral wreck were either shattered or turned aside when they were wielded against"], [20, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 8 the cold, smooth, glittering surface which had been presented to them for a couple of years. There was only one advantage which the clergyman could be said to have gained in the protracted struggle, and it was certain to have its weight with him \u2014 to wit, the power of minimising Tony North's capacities for mischief to the smallest point. Dwelling with his reverend cousin in the remote thinly peopled moorland parish in which Miles North's influence was real and strong, Tony could not well march an army into the enemy's country and burn and ravage on every side of him. He was reduced to a light skirmishing with such materials as he could find in the cause of the Prince of Darkness. The ' Furze Bush ' was beneath his notice ; that at once repelled him by its clownishness, and was not subject to such gifts as he could exercise. Besides, Jem Endicott was frequently there, and Tony North had not only no fancy for encounter-"], [21, "A MODEL CLERGYMAN AT HOME 9 ing Jem ; he, Tony, had already tried his hand, just to keep it in practice, in that quarter, and the experiment had proved fruitless. It was simply when Mr. Tony could encounter the idlest and fastest of the sportsmen squatting around Oxcleeve, or make his way to Ashford and inveigle silly boys and girls into his net for small gam bling, petty dissipation, levity, and general deceit, that he could accomplish trifling guerilla marauding. Tony hated Oxcleeve and everything connected with it, but he had no resource at present save taxing his cousin's hospitality, and doing all he could with any outward grace to vex and thwart the dispenser of the hospitality. ' Serve him right,' muttered Tony through his moustache, waxed and curled up at the corners in order to make him look a fiercer blackguard than he really was. ' He intends to take it out of me in pulling me up and keeping me straight. Confound his clerical impertinence! It is a mean, low advantage to take of a"], [22, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 10 fellow when he is down in his luck ; but I'll be even with him yet.' Latterly Tony North had been happy in finding a way to elude Miles North's efforts to render him harmless, and to worry Miles to a degree which the vicar could not even bring himself to own. The sole word to be said for Tony North was, that though he had in full the cold heart and the good digestion particularly desirable for worldly success, he had not been successful. Indeed, he had little else to employ on his own behalf except a quick sneering tongue, being the larger part of the social coin which he had picked up freely while he was running through his patrimony and ruining his chances in life. He had not Celia Endicott's excuse of a miserable family history to account for his hard nature and moral depravity, but neither had he above a tithe of Celia's brains with which to make his way in the world, and for which to account on a day of reckoning. At this time he was"], [23, "A MODEL CLERGYMAN AT HOME 11 a less innocent Micawber waiting for some thing 'turning up,' depending besottedly on the good offices of influential connections and friends whom he had either tired out and alienated long ago, or who had forgotten his very face the moment it had passed out of their sight. His cousin Miles was the single person who still stood, in a way, by Tony North, and Tony was prepared to re ward Miles according to Tony's kind. The two men were together in Miles's study on so fine a June morning that it ad mitted of both the low broad lattice windows being thrown open, admitting a flood of light, as well as a summer wind bearing all the sweet scents of the garden and moor upon its wings. The open air acted differently on the different occupants of the room. The clergyman with his fair-complexioned, immo bile face, which would not tan, stood in the sunshine without winking, and lifted up his head as if he hked to feel the stirring of his blonde hair and spotless tie. Tony shivered,"], [24, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 12 shrank, and blinked. He even ostentatiously turned up the collar of his morning coat and moved his chair into the shelter of one of the window-curtains, as a covert reproach to his host who had opened the windows. Tony bore no family likeness to his cousin except somewhat in size and build ; he was not merely dark where the other was fair: his thin sallow face, with features of the nut cracker type \u2014 already decidedly pronounced \u2014 might be classed by their owner as dis tinguished and aristocratic, but they could never by any stretch of the imagination have been called handsome. There was one re spect in which they bore anything save a resemblance to the repose of Miles's straight nose, firm hps, and full inflexible chin. Tony's features were in constant motion. His critics said he gibbered as well as chat tered. He was really a httle younger than his cousin, though he looked older \u2014 to the extent of having a worn, exhausted air ; but that might be partly affectation, like the"], [25, "A MODEL CLERGYMAN AT HOME 13 turning up of his coat-collar against the light morning breeze. Where Tony North got his clothes and his pocket-money was a mystery to most people, but he seemed still to have dealings with a fashionable tailor, for his morning coat and all the other items were faultless and in excellent condition ; whereas the Rev. Miles's coat looked as if it had been made by a man who had copied the fashion of the other coat and just missed the secret of its perfection. The first article was somewhat weather-beaten also, and the wearer's boots betrayed traces of wanting repair, in keeping with the coat. It was as if the vicar had not always spare money to keep his wardrobe as much up to the mark as he was bent on keeping everything else with which he had to do. On the other hand, he was by no means indifferent to the broadening and whitening of a seam, the cracking of leather, and the threatening separation of soles and uppers in boots. A missing button, the effect of a"], [26, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 14 splash of mud, the frayed edge of a cuff fretted him considerably more than they fretted far inferior people; but he could master the fretting. Miles had been up hours before. He had held early morning service for the behoof of eleven worshippers, including himself and his clerk. He had breakfasted. He had gone the round of the offices. He had come in again to be busy about some parish work, while Tony had dawdled down from his room within the last half-hour, and was still engaged in what he would have called ' pecking ' at the food on the breakfast-table, though in fact he was steadily eating into it with an excellent appetite. Miles, in place of settling himself with the least possible commotion and delay, ac cording to his wont, to whatever he had to do, walked in an uneasy random manner from the bookcase to the window and back again, as if he had something seriously disturbing his mind \u2014 which was precisely what he had."], [27, "A MODEL CLERGYMAN AT HOME 15 ' Excuse me, my dear fellow,' exclaimed Tony, showing himself ruffled in spite of his languor, 'why will your boots creak so? You ought to get damages from your boot maker. And, by the way, you should speak to your cook about these kidneys \u2014 if she cannot send them up hot, then I should make the house too hot for her. As a matter of principle, never take carelessness from a ser vant. I am surprised that you do not look at the thing in that light.' ' Speak to Hicks yourself about it,' said Mies hastily, and then his sense of justice rebuked him. ' I dare say the kidneys were sent up hot, at the proper time,' he added, by way of amendment. ' You are aware I don't keep a large staff of servants ; neither is my kitchen, like the kitchen in a great house, supplied with every convenience, including ranges of hot plates. Hours must be attended to here. But I wish to speak to you on something of much more consequence, Tony ; ' and Miles flung himself impatiently into his"], [28, "16 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS chair, sighing by anticipation, and confronted his cousin. ' Glad to hear it, Miles,' said Tony, with his mouth still full of the disparaged kidneys. ' You rarely spare a moment for my enter tainment. In the words of a once favourite song, \" Peter never thinks of me.\" I suppose it is the way of the world \u2014 I'm not worth think ing about. But, upon my honour, I am at a loss to imagine what can be of more consequence in this desert than kidneys piping hot versus kidneys lukewarm. Faugh ! what mare's-nest have you been finding lately, my dear boy ? ' ' I have been finding no mare's-nest, and I wish to Heaven you would be in earnest,' said Miles, in rising heat and vexation. ' Softly, softly. Never was there such an irascible clerical. Indeed, I am in sad and sober earnest for the most part nowadays. What on earth should I find to jest about here? But, equally, what on earth would you have me do? Weep and bemoan my hard fate ? '"], [29, "A MODEL CLERGYMAN AT HOME 17 ' You had better do something to better your fate,' said Miles drily. 'Don't I try it on with every breath I draw ? ' urged Tony, with a mahcious twinkle in his eye. ' I don't see that it will do you any good,' continued Miles angrily, ' unless in the shape of a momentary and far from honourable gratification, to behave in a way which you know that no gentleman \u2014 I do not say no honest man \u2014 would allow himself to do. You must be sensible that you could not do it were the circumstances different \u2014 that you are taking gross advantage of the difficulties of the situation and of a young girl's igno rance and inexperience.' Mr. Tony did not examine his nails, but he did what was still more provoking. He looked Miles in the face with an exceedingly amused expression in his own shifty glance, as if he found, to his surprise, that his host had at last condescended to minister to his guest's intellectual wants, and had VOL. II. c"], [30, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 18 been supremely successful in the ministra tion. ' What young girl, and what situation ? ' he asked, putting down his knife and fork, and sitting up in his chair as if he were fairly interested. ' Perhaps you will do me the favour to point that out, after you have had the amazing candour to tell me in your own house that I am not a gentleman \u2014 we'll let the honest man pass, as you say. Pardon me, Miles, but your calling is not improving your manners.' ' This is not a question of manners,' said Miles sternly ; ' and you know very well that I am speaking in reference to the Endicotts,' he ended, with an involuntary droop of his eyes, and a faint colour rising in his pale face. ' Oh ! ' cried Tony, ' the murder is out ! ' and he leant back and pressed the tips of his ten fingers together in a bravado of ease and relaxation. ' It is the old story ; I am not to interfere with his reverence's rights and privileges.'"], [31, "A MODEL CLERGYMAN AT HOME 19 ' Tony, if you don't take care what you are about,' cried the usually calm Miles furiously, ' I'll pitch you out of one of these windows, though I were ten times a clergy man.' 'I don't doubt you would try it,' said Tony composedly. 'I don't doubt it in the least ; but though you are a shade bigger and stronger than I, there are two at a bar gain-making. Then there is your bishop, my good man, with the scandal in the Church and the parish, and the bad example to the servants. Don't forget the bad example to the servants.' ' Look here, Tony North,' said Miles, grasping the arms of his chair to keep his hands employed ; ' I have told you already that I will not have this affair, or whatever you call it, going on in my parish. It shall not receive any countenance from me. I will not be met by gossip about it wherever I turn. I have borne a good deal from you for various reasons, but there are some things c 2"], [32, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 20 that I will not stand. I have warned you of this before.' 'Then, in addition to your unexampled goodness, of which you magnanimously re mind me, will you take the trouble to state the things which you cannot stand ? You do not mean that I am accountable for the Endicott family and their agreeable antece dents ? I am a poor enough devil myself, but I fail to see how that makes me accountable for the presence in this favoured locality of \u2014 \u2022 poor angels, shall I say? with their wretched menage and odd unconventional ways.' 'You are accountable for meeting and walking tete-a-tete with one or other of the Miss Endicotts continually,' said Miles deli berately. ' You rowed her alone for a whole rainy afternoon last week on Delaval Pool. You were seen with her again, as you have been seen before, in the twilight and the moon light, on the Ashford road as late as ten o'clock at night. Are you aware of what you are doing ? Do you ever consider how you are"], [33, "A MODEL CLERGYMAN AT HOME 21 compromising the unfortunate young lady by such foolish, reckless conduct ? You are penniless and burdened with debt, which you cannot pay ; and I should simply be ruining myself and defrauding the poor of my people if I were to attempt to discharge any portion of it. Your future is a blank. Marriage is the very last idea you ought to have in your head ; indeed, I do you the justice \u2014 scant enough in this instance \u2014 to feel convinced that you have never entertained so prepos terous and impracticable a notion.' Notwithstanding his proximity to the farthest window Tony tittered, ' I do not deny that I am a miserable sinner. I have got into a good many scrapes in my time, and have been called upon to answer for them, and found it highly inconvenient. But I assure you, Miles, I was never asked my \" intentions \" before. The experience is not at all unpleasant. I dare say it may not be quite so agreeable where there is a possibility of one's having intentions. As it is, it makes"], [34, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 22 one feel a \" warm \" man, with a nice com fortable balance at his banker's, instead of a penniless individual beset by black looks and protested bills. It implies also something nearer a steady old boy \u2014 as sweet and art less as a curate, and as virtuous and ener- getic as his vicar. ' Tomfoolery ! ' ejaculated Miles indig nantly. Tony composed his countenance and re sumed : ' When a man is accused of any offence, he expects, as an indulgence to which he is entitled, not only that a charge should be made, but that the whole facts of the case should be laid before him.

By the way, that is a naughty fib of an exaggeration \u2014 I remember hearing your stable clock strike as I turned in at your gate, and it struck the quarter \u2014 the three-quarters past nine, while I had parted with this vague and shadowy Miss Endicott of yours at least a quarter of an hour before. Oh, you misrepresenting, evil judging, clodhopping gossips of Oxcleeve ! don't you know that half-past nine by the clock is a maid-of-all-work's innocent hour for returning from an outing? Why don't you preach one of your eloquent sermons, Miles, on the sin of a man, or most likely a woman \u2014 for I can see the flutter of petticoats as well as of a cassock in this storm in a teacup, bearing false witness against a couple of neighbours ? ' Tony spoke not only with the utmost effrontery, there was an accent of lurking triumph, only half subdued, and an echo of unholy glee in his defence. Miles endured it with difficulty. ' I don't wish to enter into particulars,' he said coldly."], [36, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 24 ' You have done enough by your selfish pursuit of your own pleasure, and your utter disregard of the consequences to others, to compromise any one who is foohsh enough to trust you.

' Perhaps she is playing with me,' said Tony meekly. Miles went on without deigning to notice the interruption. ' I may say, further, that, bad and heartless as the game is, if it were anything worse \u2014 anything infamous \u2014 you should not remain here another hour.' ' You have the cure in your own hands,' said Tony, with a shade of sullenness for the"], [37, "A MODEL CLERGYMAN AT HOME 25 first time steahng into the light manner in which he chose to treat the discussion. Miles raised his eyebrows, which, like his mouth, were capable of supercilious curves, and gave a jerk to the knee which he was now clasping with both hands. Was Tony also among the prophets that he should sug gest an antidote to the poison of his own brewing ? ' It strikes me,' resumed Tony, ' that there is what would be on the whole a less objec tionable course, and one which without ques tion would be more efficacious than any weak attempt at tampering with a man's liberty of action.' ' Under stern necessity, and in a good cause,' muttered Miles. ' You coolly propose to your own flesh and blood, your social equal \u2014 I suppose I am still your equal : though I have wasted my goods on what you may call \" riotous living,\" I have not disgraced my name ; I am not a criminal,' declared Tony, as if he were stating"], [38, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 26 a highly meritorious fact; he went on with still more resentment and passion in his voice \u2014 ' yet you propose to me restrictions which no man with the spirit of the most abject cur would subject himself to.' ' They are restrictions that every upright man is bound to subject himself to,' retorted Miles. ' That is your opinion, is it ? You had better hear me out before you give it,' rephed Tony, mastering himself sufficiently to return to his raUying tone, while he stood up and leant against the chimney-piece. ' I must walk out while I am in this cursed hole. You will allow that, especially as you have been rather stingy about giving me the use of those poor brutes of yours ? ' You broke old Smoke's knees, and brought back young Bob with his mouth galled and raw,' said the vicar laconically.

It is full of lonely holes and corners, and I cannot tell whom I may or may not encounter in any of them at any time. I myself am not devoted to my own company as you are. I have no vocation for silent solitude, improving medi tation and self-examination. I am not a medi\u00e6val saint with a mission to the bestial creation.' ' Nobody suspects you of such a thing, said Miles sternly. ' Then I positively dechne to pledge my self not to recognise a girl because I find her straying with the cattle and the crows to Stony Gate or White Ridge or Fox's Hope ; or, if she be nearer home, when she has gone"], [40, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 28 out, like myself and one of your patriarchs, to meditate at eventide, I tell you I must re cognise her when I meet her, greet her, and lend her my escort if she care to have it. You take too much upon you as my cousin and host and the priest of the parish.' ' I should like to see you make that out,' said Miles grimly. ' Well, to put it plainly,' declared Tony, drawing his brows together with a scowl for a second, and the next instant smiling blandly again, ' you interfere in matters in which no gentleman would meddle with another. I crave leave to tell you that, in return for your gratuitous information that I am behaving as no man of honour would behave. But you have always the alternative, Miles.' ' What ? ' demanded Miles sharply. ' This house is yours \u2014 a fact of which you have taken occasion to remind me more than once in the course of this agreeable conver sation. Turn me out of it.

I have stayed an un conscionable time under your roof, which is not yours altogether, as you have kindly ex plained \u2014 it belongs primarily to the Church and the parish. I have taken an undue advantage of our relationship. It is a matter of moonshine, and, further, it is a matter entirely between ourselves that I have no other roof to shelter me. I dare say something will turn up. You have only to say the word.' He could not say the word \u2014 not yet. Strong-wiUed as Miles North was, he recoiled from the alternative. It was the usual suc cessful appeal of an ungenerous to a generous man, of a braggart and craven at heart to a true man and a modest at the core, though he might be a lion in his office. ' To go or stay rests with yourself, Tony,' said the vicar slowly. ' You know I have not grudged you my house.

But I am not my own master, and I have a right to require that you should act in a manner becoming your shelter, becoming my cloth and your duty.' With these words Miles got up and quitted the room. He was fain to put an end to one of many irksome and grievous altercations, from which all the comfort left to him had been that he had so far spoken his mind and cleared his conscience. ' He may think better of it,' reflected Miles, without much hope. ' I am convinced he has no other end in view than that of amusing himself, and he may calculate that there will be more lost than gained if he persist in this form of amuse ment ; and she \u2014 when she comes to know the truth, poor, weak, deluded girl \u2014 may have nothing more to do with him. God knows"], [43, "A MODEL CLERGYMAN AT HOME 31 what is to become of him. I have not his faith in something turning up ; but, at least, I cannot, unless I am compelled to do it, cut away the last inch of ground under his feet.'

However, with Celia Endicott to back me, I'll be even with you, Mr. Miles.

THE VICAR ASKS LADY JONES'S OPINION ON WHITE SEAM. As a matter of course, the Rev. Miles North visited his new parishioner Lady Jones, and almost as a matter of course he conceived a high opinion of her, though, like the rest of the world, he was puzzled to see what she was doing in Oxcleeve, and he was forced to admit that some of her ways were, to say the least, odd. Her avoidance of the small amount of general society, for instance, on the plea of her infirmity, which was no plea, in the hght of her daily drives along the moorland tracks and her invasion of the tabooed family of her landlord at Blackhall. Everything is known in a village and a village district, and everybody, from Zecchy Sampson VOL. II. d"], [46, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 34 to Lovey Veale, had heard of Lady Jones's call on the Endicotts, and had delivered his or her opinion in various shades of the local dialect. ' Zome volks were mighty queer in the company they choz, when they might 'a had the pick of the gentry to dine and sup wi'. But Endicott of Blackhall, though he were down in the mouth, was my lady's landlord \u2014 there was no mistake there ; and very like that was the risen why she chose the family, though they were none zo honourable in what they corned from, and none zo petickler in what they dooed, as the young squire and tew boarding-zchool misses ought to 'a been.' Indeed, Lady Jones had not made any concealment of her visit, else she would surely have had the discretion not to an nounce it beforehand to Mrs. Reynolds, who was as good as a bellman round the skirts of the moor. But the vicar was not repelled \u2014 on the contrary, he was attracted by the act of in dependence and daring on the part of his"], [47, "THE VICAR ASKS LADY JONES'S OPINION 35 parishioner. He was thankful in his heart of hearts that these girls, so left to themselves, and apparently so ready to avail themselves of the isolation in order to run into mischief, should have the experience of a woman, an experienced, kindly woman of mature years, brought to bear on them \u2014 that they should be taken up by a lady who had an excuse for taking them up. Miles North had no doubt that Lady Jones was a lady, judging her not by the external evidence of her position as the widow of a Sir Benjamin Jones, late governor of what might be reckoned a remote province of Australia, but by internal showing. She was not a very well-educated woman according to modern standards ; and though she had seen a good deal of the world \u2014 regarding the term in the hght of the four quarters of the globe, for she had been in America as well as Australia \u2014 the society in which she had mixed had been, perhaps necessarily, of a primitive character. But by endless intangible proofs, D 2"], [48, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 36 which would have been as hard to forge as they were to catalogue, it was clear to any onlooker of ordinary intelligence that Lady Jones had been born and bred a lady, however rustic and reduced in her earlier circumstances ; for she sometimes spoke, in her flashes of frankness, as if she did not care to hide that she had known poverty and hardship as well as riches and ease. In spite of her physical defect, and of the incongruous blending of youth and age in her bright eyes and white hair, there was some thing at once agreeable and piquant in her personal appearance \u2014 in the tall figure with the slight waver in its lines and sway in its pose \u2014 in the face rounded and soft in its pallor \u2014 in her expression, generally calm but quickly and keenly moved at times. She had an attraction for thoughtful intelligent men beyond the age of boys \u2014 men like George Fielding and Miles North ; a fascination which lay in her own thoughtfulness and intelligence as a match for theirs."], [49, "THE VICAR ASKS LADY JONES'S OPINION 37 She was not like a younger woman occu pied with herself, engrossed in the working out of the problem of her history. The first stages of her history were accomplished, while she was plainly not so old that life might not hold other experiences for her. She looked sometimes, in the midst of her outward tran quillity, as if she were eagerly anticipating fresh experiences. Still she was at leisure to attend to what was passing around her, and, as a matter of course, she noticed everything and laid it to heart. She was more of a quiet listener than a talker ; but she could and did talk admir ably, with originality and earnestness, though it was neither on politics, nor literature, nor fashion. She talked on natural phenomena at home and abroad \u2014 on this Devonshire moor as contrasted with the Australian bush and the American backwoods ; on the wonders of the sky above and the wilderness around \u2014 whether the last were a wilderness of coarse grass, furze, and heather, or prickly pear and"], [50, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 38 blue gum-trees, or shoreless waters ; she talked on plants and animals, but especially on country and village life, with which she seemed to have endless sympathy. She was never tired planning, and carrying out her plans, for the benefit of her poorer neigh bours. Lady Jones was a perfect treasure to the Reverend Miles, beset, even on the verge of a moor, by dangerous, frivolous young ladies, and pompous, interfering old ones. He ranked Lady Jones as old enough to be available for a friend, while she was wise enough with the modesty of true wisdom not to abuse the privilege. Scandal was set at nought by her silvered hair and the per petual insignia of her widowhood in the plain black gowns and mourning caps, at which Mrs. Reynolds cried out with alarmed esprit de corps. Besides, it was difficult to think of scandal attaching to Lady Jones in her simplicity and sincerity, and in her gravity, which was only roused and lit up"], [51, "THE VICAR ASKS LADY JONES'S OPINION 39 now and again by flashes of humour like her flashes of frankness. It was a relief and rest to Miles North many a time to open the wicket-gate of the Court, walk down the flagged path, and sit for a little while in one of the unadorned parlours with its mistress. He could be as silent or as talkative as he liked. She always met him half way, unless when he lost his temper, and his good-i breeding with it, and allowed himself to hint at the trying nature of the assistance which Mrs. Reynolds and several hke-minded ladies of uncertain age among the summer visitors in the neighbourhood were prone to render him in his office. Then Lady Jones would only smile faintly and say nothing, and he felt afterwards that he respected her the more for the silent rebuke which she had dealt to him. The material refreshment which she offered him was of the simplest description \u2014 a cup of her tea or a glass of her Australian wine. He could not help being somewhat of a connoisseur in tea and"], [52, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 40 wine, and he was inchned to pronounce her Australian vintage \u2014 of which she was in nocently proud, with a pride perhaps derived from the late Sir Benjamin \u2014 poor stuff, and her tea no better than what might be had from any respectable Ashford grocer ; but the spiritual refreshment she gave him made him ashamed of criticising the other. She was evidently careless of what belonged to the comforts of the table as she was indif ferent, in spite of her so-called lameness, to soft seats and easy lounges ; a nun vowed to poverty and austerity could hardly have been more so. He never once caught his hostess reclining on a couch, or in an easy chair, as he had surprised Mrs. Reynolds when she was surreptitiously taking her afternoon nap. Cushions were only a trouble to Lady Jones, and, like hand-screens and flower-glasses, got in her way. Clearly, the late Sir Benjamin \u2014 if he had been a man of the people, which seemed most likely \u2014 had lived and died a Spartan, with a grand scorn of self-indul-"], [53, "THE VICAR ASKS LADY JONES'S OPINION 41 gence which men of the people, of all men, are least given to display. All the time Miles North comprehended that Lady Jones's hardy, well-nigh frugal practice was habit and inadvertence ; that if she had guessed for a moment that any of her few visitors desired a haven of springs and air-cushions, a cup of souchong, a glass of madeira which had been more than once round the Cape, she would have taken the greatest pains to procure it for the fastidious individual's benefit, and would have pressed it upon him, as she did press the clotted cream \u2014 the single local luxury which was to be found in perfection at her tea-table. The longer he knew her the higher grew the Rev. Miles's esteem for the latest importa tion among his parishioners, until a bright idea struck him in connection with her and himself. He wished some lady to inspect the sewing classes in his school, of which little Kitty Carew was the mistress. He hked to keep the school as much as possible in his"], [54, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 42 own hand, and he felt himself competent to inspect and pronounce on every other depart ment of the institution ; so that the Govern ment inspectors, when he summoned them to see what he was doing in the matter of edu cation, and to make him a grant from the public funds, would be the most unreasonable of men if they did not declare that the standard he maintained was excellent. But he could not take it upon him to sit on the comparative merits and demerits of the sewing. He was a little at a loss to under stand how the inspectors \u2014 seeing they were but inspectors and not inspectresses \u2014 could be more competent than he was in the matter ; but that was their business and the Government's, not his. He had great faith in little Kitty, whom he had so far reared and trained for his purpose ; but his faith in her was not so absolute that he should feel himself justified in confiding solely to her ability and discretion a branch of teaching in which he was inevitably deficient, the neglect"], [55, "THE VICAR ASKS LADY JONES'S OPINION 43 of which might bring discredit on the whole establishment. Kitty Carew had answered very fairly as yet, but she was little more than a year out of her teens, and she had been, to his regret, getting out of health for some time, while her spirits had gone down in proportion. She was not the bright, capable little girl she had been three years ago. He had found fault with her about some trifle one day lately, and instead of standing up for herself with no lack of girlish complacency and self-reliance, and an almost comical air of outraged justice, she had distressed him by bursting into a passion of tears. She was not at all given to tears ; he had never seen her cry, even in her pupil days. Fortunately, none of the scholars had been present, and she had controlled herself instantly, and looked grievously affronted at her own childishness, so he had let the thing drop without more ado. But if Kitty were ailing and not mistress of herself, she might be tempted to ' scamp '"], [56, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 44 the work of the one department in which there was no danger of his interference. Or it might be her single-handed responsibility in this matter which was weighing on Kitty's mind, and rendering her still further out of sorts. He had thought of two things : he might appoint a committee of ladies to report on the sewing class. But so many ladies would consider themselves qualified for the appointment that the selection of reporters might be a more ticklish and invidious affair than the naming of a choir-leader. There must be hmitations ; yet any limitation would require to be of a very delicate nature which should keep Mrs. Barnes of Barnes Clyffe from bringing her girls, always on the wing for any fresh occupation and entertainment, or Mrs. Lacy from introducing her unmarried sisters who were visiting at Thorn, and crying out against the dulness of the country and the dearth of engagements of any kind. Finally, a luncheon party, or at least an afternoon tea, must be organised at the"], [57, "THE VICAR ASKS LADY JONES'S OPINION 45 vicarage for the benefit of the committee ; and he had great doubts, not so much of the capabihties of Hicks, his housekeeper, as of the proper behaviour of his cousin Tony on the occasion, especially if young ladies gained admittance to the gathering. He had thought of conquering himself, and request ing Mrs. Reynolds to walk over with him to the school and pass her judgment on the girls' sewing. But oh the manner in which she would dole out her decisions and magnify her temporary power by sitting upon poor Kitty and the girls, and on him also ! He would never hear the end of it. Having been rashly invited by him to put her large, imposing finger into the pie, Mrs. Reynolds would not be satisfied until she had thrust her whole colossal hand after the finger. But Lady Jones was a very different person. Every woman knew more or less about sewing, and she was sure not to be an exception. If she could be induced to do him the favour he believed the dilemma would be disposed of in"], [58, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 46 the pleasantest manner. For it would be a gratification to him to go over his school with her and hear what she thought of it. She might not be learned \u2014 she might not even have been as carefully grounded in element ary knowledge as he flattered himself these children were ; but he put so much depend ence on her excellent common sense, and her judgment generally, that he felt her approval was well worth securing. He considered that her feelings were altogether friendly towards him ; he even thought that she took a stronger interest in him and his work than he could altogether account for, seeing that she was not the style of woman who viewed her parson and his parish as necessarily her private property. Anyhow, he should hear the truth from her without having it coloured by the medium through which it passed. She would do her part as simply and unobtrusively as he could desire, and there would be the agreeable conclusion of the whole matter."], [59, "THE VICAR ASKS LADY JONES'S OPINION 47 Mies North was absolutely elated by his bright idea ; but when he went to solicit Lady Jones's co-operation he found her out \u2014 as he might have expected \u2014 early on the afternoon of a day which had begun with torrents of rain and was ending in a stormy splendour which did not bode well for the weather of the next day, but was likely to call forth any lover of nature. He could only hope for better luck next time. Next time, so far as meeting Lady Jones went, was nearer than he had counted on ; for as he was returning past the church and school he encountered the object of his search. She was driving her ponies down the lane in the most opportune manner, apart from the drawback that she was not driving alone ; and the lady who was in the carriage with Lady Jones was also an acquaintance of the vicar's, a youthful acquaintance \u2014 Miss Lucy Endicott. At any other time Miles, who had the interests of many people at heart, would"], [60, "48 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS have hailed the incident with satisfaction, arguing from it the increasingly friendly foot ing which was being established between Lady Jones and her landlord's family. So far as Lady Jones's feehngs and wishes were concerned, he would not have been wrong ; but apart from this, the truth was that Celia had fulfilled her intention of barring the way to all intercourse, save what was of the most formal kind, in which she took care to share, between Lady Jones and Lucy. It was by the merest accident that the two had crossed each other's paths when there was no third person to come between them, on the major village green, among the ducks and geese ; and the elder had stopped her redoubtable steeds and invited the younger to join her. Lucy had accepted the invitation ; not with out considerable inward perturbation, because of the light in which the expedition might be regarded by her domestic tyrant. But, having made the experiment, there was no doubt it had turned out well for the pair concerned."], [61, "THE VICAR ASKS LADY JONES'S OPINION 49 Lady Jones had begun by humouring Lucy in giving up her ladyship's beloved moor, and driving instead through a succes sion of the steep, deep lanes, which were almost as characteristic a feature of the landscape as the moor itself. Lucy loved the lanes, while she recoiled from the savage moor. She was always in pursuit of hart's tongue ferns and supplies of foxglove, honey suckle, and virgin's-bower to make up for the lack of flowers at Blackhall. She had quite a pretty fancy in mosses, wild strawberries, harebells, potentillas, herb Roberts \u2014 all the small fry of flowering plants which formed the groundwork of the banks of the lanes. She had no objection to clusters of brambles and nuts, even in their most unripe stages. They served as evanescent decorations for the barebones parlour at Blackhall. Lady Jones was very good-natured. She stopped her ponies over and over again. She did not complain of muddy shoes and skirts, and never wearied of waiting, as VOL. II. E"], [62, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 50 Celia did when Lucy was getting her spoil. Her ladyship went so far as to apologise in the most unaffected manner for not being able to get out and scramble in her turn. She pointed with her whip to the devil's-bit scabious, declaring that its intense blue shamed the blue harebells \u2014 not to say the lavender of the ordinary scabious, and was as fresh as the moor itself, to which it belonged like the heather and the furze. Lucy was so much the better for the rare encouragement and indulgence, that her blue eyes cleared and deepened hke the most vagabond of scabiouses. Her pink colour freshened to a wild-rose tint ; her yellow hair was like the pale gold tentacles of the honeysuckle. She began to prattle about her fancy-work, the school she had left, her Uncle and Aunt Lowndes at Teignmouth with whom she and Celia had stayed for some weeks before coming to Blackhall. Lady Jones looked down on her com panion and listened, smiling, and sighing"], [63, "THE VICAR ASKS LADY JONES'S OPINION 51 from her superior experience, whatever it might have been. Certainly it did not impair her interest in Lucy's stories, on which she hung with an attention which flattered Lucy extremely. The couple were as unlike as a pale widow between thirty and forty and a blooming girl of twenty can well be ; yet the alliance was singularly becoming to both of them. The young vicar felt as if he had never seen Lady Jones's womanliness appear to greater advantage, or Lucy Endicott's girlishness so sweet and bright \u2014 so piteously lamb-like for it to fall into the clutches of a wolf hke Tony \u2014 as it looked to-day. At the same time her presence interfered consider ably with his comfort, and with the perfect prudence of his preconcerted plans. He imagined himself under the necessity of doing more than take off his hat to the pair.

It was awk ward to enter on the subject before a third person, and that third person Miss Lucy Endicott, who was an adept with her needle ; but in his present frame of mind there seemed ho help for it. Miss Lucy Endicott was reasonable, and had struck him as the reverse of forward \u2014 rather a timid, retiring girl, in short. He could not imagine that she would feel aggrieved by not being included in a proposal which he could only address with fitness to an older and more responsible woman. Miles stood uncovered at the ponies' heads in the middle of the wet road \u2014 just where it began to emerge from the hollow and to wind among the broken hillocky ground with a tuft of heather here and there to mark the locality \u2014 and rushed into his petition. Lady Jones, to begin with, had the air as if something had just happened to her which had been very pleasant, therefore she listened with a gracious and cheerful countenance."], [65, "THE VICAR ASKS LADY JONES S OPINION 53 Lucy twisted together the stalks of the devil's bit scabiouses which she held in her ungloved hand, and glanced at the speaker with artless and disinterested admiration. 'I should be very glad to be of use to your school, Mr. North,' said Lady Jones at last ; ' but I am afraid I am not very well qualified. I never was a very good sewer of white seam, or, I am sorry to say, of any kind of seam, though I had to do it formerly, both when I was young and when we lived in the Bush. Somehow I seemed to fall far short either of the faculty or the opportunity of bringing my sewing to perfection ; though I was not early spoilt by sewing machines. Now I dare say you had one or two in your school ? ' taking Lucy into the conversation. ' Oh, no !

We did not"], [66, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 54 make our own clothes at school, of course,' went on Lucy with her air of gentle dignity, \u2022 but we had to mend them ; and we had a basket for the poor, one afternoon a week.' ' Then I have no doubt that you sew far better than I ; suppose you undertake to in spect the schoolgirls' work ? ' Had Lady Jones lost her head, on which Miles had put such dependence, that she could make the outrageous suggestion ? He was put out to such a degree that he felt he looked it, and he hated to show his feelings at any time. Even Lucy blushed, and hesitated at the unsuitable promotion thrust upon her."], [67, "55 CHAPTER XVH. KITTY CAREW IN HER SCHOOLROOM. Apparently Lady Jones recollected herself. ' Could we not both go with you now when we are here ? ' She made a quick amend ment on her original proposal. ' We are passing the school, and I don't think it is dis missed for the day. You would have the benefit of a couple of opinions instead of one. In the multitude of counsellors there is wisdom.' She had disentangled herself adroitly from the labyrinth she had got into. This was better \u2014 a great deal better when he came to think of it, especially after he caught Lucy Endicott's expression of eager expectation. This was, perhaps, the most sensible notion which had occurred to anybody yet \u2014 to make"], [68, "56 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS the examination off-hand, without agitating Kitty or the schoolgirls by a previous intima tion on the subject ; to be able to say after wards to the persons who had a right to an explanation, ' Lady Jones was driving by, and was good enough to look in, at my re quest, and tell me what she thought of the work.' It was an arrangement with which the greatest busybody and carper could not find fault. Autocrat as he was in his own person, his office exposed him to fault-finding, especially from his lady helpers, which even he was not always strong enough to nip in the bud and to treat with supreme indiffer ence. Nobody was likely to inquire whether Lady Jones had been alone or accompanied by a friend. Even supposing the truth leaked out \u2014 supposing Lucy Endicott's tongue ran wild on the compliment which had been paid to her \u2014 she had been put too much beyond the pale of the upper ten of the parish for the echo of her tongue to reach them ; or suppos-"], [69, "KITTY CAREW IN HER SCHOOLROOM 57 ing the schoolgirls recognised her, as, to be sure, they must, and gossiped about her visit to the school, who listened to the gossip of schoolgirls ? After all, the matter concerned himself and nobody else. The more the Rev. Miles had time to think of it the more he was inclined to regard Lady Jones's appearance on the scene just then and there as a most fortunate coincidence. He accepted her offer with becoming grati tude, while he would not let himself dweU on the attractive spectacle of a delighted face beneath a shady hat wreathed with a grey veil. He did not take in the grey veil. He had lost sight for the moment of anything which the veil's conjunction with a grey cloak might have recalled to him \u2014 anything with which Lady Jones was probably totally unacquainted. She did not practise Miles's reserve in making the most of the gratification she had conferred. She looked at Lucy Endicott's pride and pleasure as if she enjoyed witnessing them. She kept adding to them"], [70, "58 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS by associating herself and Lucy in the kindest possible manner. She dwelt on the association as if it also were very welcome to her. ' You and I will do our best,' she said caressingly to Lucy. With all the restrained force of character that was very plain in Lady Jones, any one who had listened to her with Lucy might have been awakened to the fact that along with the force there was probably in the childless woman's breast a repressed principle of motherhood, a half-dumb capacity of in- finite fondness and indulgence latent in her from childhood. 'You and I have never done anything together save take this little drive. Let us try what we can do \u2014 you and I. Let us hope that we may yet accomplish wonderful things together some day. What do you say, Miss Lucy ? ' Lady Jones said in a tone of wistful jesting. What could Lucy say, except that Lady Jones, to whom she had not spoken more than half a dozen times before to-day, was"], [71, "KITTY CAREW IN HER SCHOOLROOM 59 only too kind, too good ? The tears \u2014 happy tears in this instance \u2014 which were always so near Lucy's eyes, sprang to them at the stranger's kindness. Lady Jones was sharp to distinguish not only the fleeting moisture, but the inference of strangeness between the two. ' Ah, yes ! ' she said, half disconsolately, ' we are strangers to each other \u2014 there's the rub.' In the meantime the vicar was conduct ing his allies up the sidepath to the brick school-house, from which the shrill voices of young children singing their hymn of dis missal were issuing. Indeed, the bigger boys and their master, tenants of the larger half of the building, were gone some time before ; whde a troop of smaller boys, just let loose, were scampering off in every direction \u2014 all the more fleetly because the vicar's hat loomed on their horizon. They were not, if they knew it, to be arrested, turned back, and subjected to another trial of their juvenile endurance. Only one extraordinary young-"], [72, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 60 ster hngered, and he was amply rewarded by having Lady Jones's ponies consigned to his charge, thus providing him with an oppor tunity for an uncensured study of horseflesh in the present, and the pleasing prospect of a reward in pence for the congenial study in the immediate future. Miles North's school was a model school, and when he entered without knocking, everything was in order. The spotless white washed walls garnished with the usual maps \u25a0 \u2014 geographical, physical, astronomical ; the black-boards flanked by the handy lumps of chalk ; the very floors and benches so regularly and scrupulously scrubbed as to bear only the mud and dust of a single day ; the books and slates in orderly files ; the needlework which the visitors had come to look at, either still held properly in the hands of embryo needlewomen, or tidily folded up and deposited in its own cupboard ; and on the teacher's desk the fresh flowers, though they consisted chiefly of daisies, honesty, and"], [73, "KITTY CAREW IN HER SCHOOLROOM 61 thyme, and were in no more elegant receptacle than a water-jug \u2014 all did credit to the Rev. Miles and to his protegee and schoolmistress, Kitty Carew. The girls, great and smaU, in their calico frocks \u2014 a few of the biggest, hke the smallest, in overgrown pinafores, after the fashion of some of the working girls in Mason's pictures \u2014 rose simultaneously, bobbed curtseys, and looked out of the corners of their eyes with much feminine interest at the intruders. 'Her in black be the widdy woman, Lady Jones, from t' Cooart. Her in the rare bonnie white and red gownd be one of them Endicott misses from Blackhall, sewer.' The mistress came forward to greet the clergyman and his friends. When she had heard his step and voice as he entered she had looked up a httle languidly, but without flutter or discomfiture, as at a friend whom she was accustomed to see most days at any hour. When she saw Lady Jones she stared, though whatever surprise and excitement she"], [74, "THE BLACK HALL GHOSTS 62 might feel were held in strict bounds by her schoolmistress's primness and sense of pro priety. But when she saw there was a second visitor, though it was only one of them Endi cott misses, whom she knew perfectly well both by sight and reputation, she grew very red, and a flurried, annoyed air came into her whole face and bearing. Perhaps she re sented the intrusion, particularly when she was not well, and had not been prepared for Avhat was coming. It was all very good, or bad, for the Reverend Miles to swoop down upon her in this fashion with an elderly lady (considerably over thirty is elderly to twenty) like Lady Jones, though he had never done so before. But he ought not \u2014 no, not though he was the vicar, and this was his school \u2014 to bring in a girl of Kitty's own age, very likely no better informed than the little schoolmistress, who had worked so hard to inform herself and to please the parson in the happy old days. Neither was Miss Lucy Endicott so wise and"], [75, "KITTY CAREW IN HER SCHOOLROOM 63 prudent on her own account, if all tales were true, that she should be picked out to domi neer over Kitty, and look down upon her in what should have been her kingdom as well as the vicar's. Kitty Carew was as unlike as possible to the typical innkeeper's daughter, the Kate Kearney with her smiles and dimples, her blending of respectful deference and engaging affability. On the other hand, she was very like the typical normal-school mistress \u2014 that nondescript shadow of a lady, who is yet not a lady \u2014 who is talked of as Miss So-and-so, and appealed to occasionally when an ad- ditional reader is wanted to make up the number for the book club, or \u2014 taking it for granted that she has some natural turn for music \u2014 when another soprano or contralto is required for one of the songs at an amateur concert, she is dealt with on terms of com- parative equality so long as her services are needed in the matter of books and songs.

There was no trace in Kitty Carew of a working girl's awkwardness or forwardness, nothing of a tradeswoman's obtuseness or pertness, of the alternations between sloven liness and over-smartness, with the lack of any sense of harmony and proportion, which are said to mark out an inferior woman from her superior. She had not even an air of shabby gentility, which saute de mieux, where other airs are concerned, sometimes takes their place in the circumstances. Kitty's manner was, as a rule, composed and self-assured \u2014 so composed, for her not long completed teens and her small size, that it had filled her father, Tom Carew, of the"], [77, "KITTY CAREW IN HER SCHOOLROOM 65 ' Furze Bush,' with the most unqualified ad miration. He had sworn that if he had cared to thwart the young parson's views for Kitty, and to put an end to her career as a school mistress by establishing her instead as the ' missus ' of his inn, he could have trusted her to cow and control the most obstreperous customer as well and better than he could do it himself. Any lady might have worn Kitty's ging ham gown and linen collar and cuff's, the tout ensemble was so simple, cool, and fresh. She did not add to them even a gilt brooch, with earrings to match ; or a silver locket, with a bangle en suite ; and she was guiltless of a fringe. Yet Kitty did not look the lady she was not, except it might be in the secret recesses of her inmost soul ; and the con sciousness that she did not was sore and bitter to her, in spite of all that was good, clever, and sensible in the girl's character. In what did the vague distinction he?

Lucy Endicott was a lady, though she had come of but sorry gentlefolk, and her shallowness and weakness, however art less and unstained as yet, would never weigh in the balance against Kitty's mother-wit, resolution, and constancy. A year or two ago Kitty Carew, just growing up, had been out of sight the prettiest girl in the neighbourhood \u2014 so pretty that her beauty might have been a snare to her in any other position ; so pretty that, even as it was, if her father, Tom Carew, had not been a thoroughly respectable man in his line, proud and independent ; if the Rev.

There had been a great deal worse scandals, even where the clergy were concerned, in the old Devonshire world. But this was a new world, in which iron con ceptions of duty and fitness reigned. Kitty was by nature a warm-coloured brunette, an English version of the Moabitess on whose firm round cheeks Such a blush In the midst of brown was born, Like red poppies grown with corn. Her stature was low, but she was finely pro portioned, and, as in the case of Louis XIV., when you were looking at her you forgot her smallness. It was quite true that she had been called in on emergencies to help the schoolmaster to awe the biggest and most i? 2"], [80, "68 THE BLACK HALL GHOSTS mutinous boys in the school, and that the in troduction of Kitty on the scene had always been a success. The impression which her petite person gave was that there was nothing wasted in her. This was an example of the appositeness of the adage Small herbs have grace, Great weeds do grow apace. What she lacked in size was made up by her quite tremendous powers of energy and per severance. In the case of her hands and feet, though symmetrically small, they were not small to deformity. In place of looking useless members of her body, they were clearly full of suppleness and nervous force It was well known at Oxcleeve that Kitty Carew had not only the brains of a man \u2014 she had the cleverest woman's hands and feet in the village. Her features were delicately regular, though on rather too compressed and miniature a scale.

If there was a defect in her face, as it had been three years ago, it lay in her eyes and eyebrows. The eyes were small, though very quick and keen, with swift darting- glances hke lambent flames. The brows were at once too marked and too straight. Altogether, Kitty Carew's face, both in its moulding and colouring, excelled most faces, though it might remind the gazer of a valuable engraving in which the lines had been a hair's breadth too deeply cut, or of a gem of a picture, in which tone and feeling were marvellously preserved and yet the quality of strength was just a shade over done. The description given in some respects applied more to Kitty as she had been when she first grew up than as she was now. She appeared out of health, as she had done more or less for years. She had the habit of spending"], [82, "THE BLACK HALL GHOSTS 70 her annual school holidays with the family of a sister of her mother's, whose husband tenanted a small farm on the outskirts of the other great twin moor of Devonshire. One would have thought that the change from the outskirts of one moor to those of another in the same county was not great ; but those who knew them well said the climate, general landscape, and people's ways of Exmoor were not much more like those of Dartmoor than Wales was like the Highlands of Scotland or the Black Forest was like the Ardennes. And Kitty would not hear of any other change, though she came back each time looking worse rather than better. A faint purple tinge had stolen into Kitty's brunette richness of colour, with something of the effect of ruddy wine diluted by water. Her eyes had grown at once restless and a little dim, as if from feverishness and want of sleep. The lines of her small firmly shut mouth were at the same time relaxed and strained, as if weariness, and a supreme determination to"], [83, "KITTY CAREW IN HER SCHOOLROOM 71 fight against the weariness to the last, had combined to take possession of the girl. The alteration in his daughter went to Tom Carew's heart ; but it beat his honest wits, and those of his cousin Betsy, to tell what ailed Kitty, who scouted at doctors and their physic, and hated to have her failing health mentioned or studied in the least par ticular. Lady Jones, with her thoughtful gaze, which seemed to take in every trifling detail, was sorry to see such a seal set on such a face, which ought to have been in its youthful prime. She could not help feeling full of speculation why it should be so. Lucy, who had never seen Kitty Carew so near at hand, though she had often remarked her from a little distance and had heard of her beauty, looked in her turn at the school mistress, and declared herself, to herself, dis appointed. Lucy did use the Hibernianism ' agreeably disappointed.' Still, she was slightly conscious that she had not been without an"], [84, "THE BLACK HALL GHOSTS 72 unconfessed, unclassified distrust and appre- hension of the reputed personal attractions of the daughter of Tom Carew of the 'Furze Bush,' the mistress of the girls' department of Mr. North's school. If Miss Carew had ever been very pretty, her good looks had not been of a lasting kind. They were unmistakably going off already. Some brunettes fade and age with frightful rapidity, Lucy reflected calmly, calling to mind her own yellow hair and fair skin, and not realising that if she and Kitty Carew survived ten or fifteen years Kitty ran less danger than her critic of a washed-out, superannuated -doll stage of beauty. Miles named the two ladies to Kitty with his well-bred deliberate nonchalance, and she recovered her equanimity, and responded with civil if stiff self-possession. The errand of the clergyman and his companions was made known. It did not disturb, it rather relieved the schoolmistress, who knew her bearings, and was aware that here, where she had been most left to herself, she had been doubly"], [85, "KITTY CAREW IN HER SCHOOLROOM 73 faithful in the discharge of her obligations. It was the scholars, who were instantly thrown into a nudging, tittering state of excitement, which Kitty found it hard to repress, when the samples of under-garments, majcr and minor \u2014 from father's best shirt to baby's new wrapper, which were to be submitted for the consideration of the worshipful Government inspectors \u2014 were, as a previous test of their merits, laid before the strange ladies. It was an anxious moment, if not for Kitty and Lady Jones, for more than the un- fledged British workwomen \u2014 treading on each other's toes and breathing hard in anticipation of the sentence to be delivered on their per- formance \u2014 for the vicar and Lucy Endicott, who entered with all her heart into the situ- ation. Lady Jones had said she believed Miss Lucy Endicott would be better qualified than she was to be of use to the vicar and his school in this matter, and had requested Lucy's company and co-operation in the improvised visit to the school. Lucy fully"], [86, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 74 believed her ladyship, for it was one of the girl's weaknesses \u2014 engaging to some people, ridiculous to others \u2014 to be credulous with regard to what she was told by people who had a right to speak authoritatively. She wTas as much impressed with the serious con sequences of the undertaking, and with her share in it, as the smallest child there who sat awestruck and had to put her thumb into her mouth to enable her to support the so lemnity of the position. It was therefore with the prettiest air of girlish importance, blushing pride, and modest confidence that Lucy flitted up and down the class and round and round the table, or hovered with meditative earnestness over the hemming and splaying and felling, the gather ing and tucking of which she was so elated and happy to think she knew the mysteries. Lady Jones stood aside and smiled softly. The vicar absolutely unbent into sitting down on a table and indulging in a low whistle. Kitty Carew stood with her head"], [87, "KITTY CAREW IN HER SCHOOLROOM 75 erect, and the gnaw of the lips and twist of the mouth which was becoming habitual with her and was spoiling its subtle curves. The flock of small girl pigeons emitted an imper ceptible twittering. At last Lucy arrived at a great conclusion, with a radiant smile of satisfaction and good will on her fair young face \u2014 blonde like the vicar's, but with the girl's so different in colouring and expression from the man's in its pale shadowless fixedness, which at the same time Lucy regarded as the complexion fit for an Apollo. Lucy was rosy red, and tremulous with the eager emotion which carried her out of her timidity and her little formal precise ways. ' Oh, Mr. North,' she cried, ' you need not have brought us here. There was no occasion to have any one \u2014 the inspectors or any one. I have no doubt every thing else is as good as the sewing, though of course I don't pretend for a moment to judge even the reading and writing before you and Lady Jones. But I do know about sewing,"], [88, "76 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS what good sewing is ; and this is beautiful, quite beautiful. The best of us at Miss Pen fold's could not have surpassed it \u2014 I am not sure that we could have equalled it ; and the very beginners do so well. Oh, Miss Carew, you are a good teacher ; I wish you joy. \u2014 I congratulate you, Mr. North,' ended Lucy in a little ecstasy. A succession of broad grins from the girls passed, with the speed of lightning, like the instantaneous spread of an infection, from one to the other, together with a truly feminine rustle of triumph. Lady Jones smiled on with a mixture of sweetness and sadness if any ore had found leisure to analyse the smile. Kitty Carew's lips gave an ominous quiver. It might be that in her overdone and sickly state she could not endure praise. The vicar had probably a suspicion and fear of this, for he sprang down from his table with an alertness that was hardly in unison with his usual curbed slowness of"], [89, "KITTY CAREW IN HER SCHOOLROOM 77 speech and action. ' I will not say we are very much obliged to you, Miss Lucy Endi cott,' he said cordially, ' but I will say that your good-natured approval deserves some acknowledgment on our part. I hope I am not mistaken as to the nature of the acknow ledgment. Miss Carew, if that comphment to you does not call forth the cup of tea, which I know you keep on the premises, for the refreshment of the ladies, I do not know what will. \u2014 Girls, if so good a report does not entitle you and your mistress to a half-holi day to-morrow, I am afraid your chances of half-holidays are small.' Girls do not cheer and do not so readily clap their hands as boys do, but they can grin and grin amain with the best, till their jaws are in danger of cracking. The school dispersed with as much tumult as girls could well create under the nose of the vicar, while the schoolmistress, and the incongruous little knot of tea-drinkers, were left to their mild potations."], [90, "78 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS It cannot be said that the tea-drinking, though it ought to have loosened tongues and broken down artificial barriers, was a success. Yet the little black teapot and common lilac and white cups which Kitty set out on a desk were not greatly inferior to the Blackhall and Court tea equipages, while the tea and bread and butter were quite as good as those to which two at least of her guests were ac customed. But a shadow fell on the party. Kitty presided over it still as if under a cer tain amount of protest. The vicar, while he waited impartially upon the others, and in sisted on pouring out the water from the kitchen boiler, insensibly drew into himself, as if he began already to recollect himself, rue the step he had taken, and scent trouble in the air. Lucy's brief burst of spirits sank under the influence of the constrained atmo sphere around her. She did more harm than good, and made herself look officious and in clined to amuse herself at the expense of her neighbours when, misled by the brilliant re-"], [91, "KITTY CAREW IN HER SCHOOLROOM 79 suit of her first attempt at being useful, she volunteered her assistance in getting up the semblance of a dainty tea-table, and brought the jug with the nosegay from Kitty's private rostrum and put it opposite the teapot, which somehow it did not keep in countenance. ' Why, here is a branch of old-fashioned fuchsia with little fuchsia-bells, just like ours at Blackhall ! ' cried Lucy, hailing a familiar object. But the innocent observation proved as inopportune as the rest of her attempts at geniality. Both the vicar and Lady Jones looked put out by it and said nothing. Kitty Carew glanced up quickly, was silent also for half a minute, and then said coldly, with a manifest effort, ' That kind of fuchsia is not uncommon in out-of-the-way places in Devonshire.' ' What have I done now ? ' Lucy asked herself, discomfited and bewildered ; and then a thought struck her, and she too showed herself vexed. ' Oh dear ! ' she took herself"], [92, "80 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS to task in her own mind ; ' what ill-fortune made me say that ? I ought to have thought before I spoke. I believe Celia is right that I have my wits to seek. I had better have bitten my tongue out than called attention to the fuchsia, though of course there are plenty of old-fashioned fuchsias in Devon shire, and I dare say there are some in the garden of the \"Furze Bush.\" But why did she not say that in so many words ? ' Lady Jones, on the Avatch for every sign of what her companions thought and felt, relapsed into more than her usual gravity, in strong contrast to her striking amiability and cheerfulness throughout the afternoon. The change was in itself alarming to Lucy, always prone to fear that she had done something wrong. It was a relief to all when the tea was drunk and the leave-taking \u2014 in which the dignity of the clergyman and his friends was as nothing to the dignity of the school mistress, Kitty \u2014 came to an end, and the party separated, the Rev.

Kitty Carew stood for a moment at 'the schoolroom door, looking after her visitors, before she turned to lock up her domain and make her way to the ' Furze Bush ' for the night. There was an odd expression of wonder, which should have had pleasure in it, yet showed little or none, in the girl's face. ' I really believe I could have liked them \u2014 both of them,' she was thinking to herself. ' Well, it don't matter about Lady Jones.

More people than Kitty shared the feeling, though they were not aware of all the reasons they had for the commiseration anymore than for the contempt. But Lucy, though she had some proper pride, would not have disdained pity as Jem scoffed at it, and Celia spurned it, and Kitty herself would have trampled upon it. Lucy would have received the conde scending sympathy artlessly enough, as a not unwelcome tribute to her misfortunes, while she would have been all the sorrier for her self, because of the sorrow of others on her"], [97, "GET WHA T YOU WANT, TLL PA V FOR IT' 85 behalf. She was incapable of trading on the feehng, but she was not above being gently consoled by it. There was only one side of her history on which, to her honour, she was too sensitive and shrinking to bear a touch, a breath. Pity her and Celia because they were orphans and poor, because Jem was so in efficient and reluctant a guardian. Yes, all the world might do that, and Lucy would almost be tempted to pose as an interesting victim on this account ; but hint that her mother had left her and Celia and their father, that she was no better than she should have been, and that Lucy's eldest sister, Joanna, had proved herself as little worth, and Lucy's cheeks would burn like fire or whiten to ashes, she would wish that the earth might open and swallow her up. Celia's malicious defiant allusions were sickening torture to Lucy. At the present moment Lucy was suffering from a lesser evil, a more commonplace vexa tion, which was, nevertheless, very real and disturbing to the sufferer. It was the time-"], [98, "86 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS immemorial trial to young women who have aspirations, while they cannot command any means for the gratification of their wishes, except what their parents or other natural guardians either dole out with a grudging hand or absolutely decline to supply. Un happily, young women who must have dress and the minimum of pleasure, if no more, while they cannot work, and are ashamed to beg from any save their unfortunate kindred, do not present a singular spectacle. When the Endicott girls made their un solicited appearance at Blackhall, they came in the last instalment of clothes with which their mother's relations had furnished the sisters \u2014 up to the time of their leaving school. Though the garments had been of the highest order of garments, which they were not, they could not be expected to last for ever ; and as for any pocket-money, by means of which Celia and Lucy could buy their dress in future, they were as destitute of the possession as of the sinews of war by which an independent"], [99, "'GET WHAT YOU WANT, I'LL PAY FOR IT' 87 existence could be sustained for a week or day. The girls' travelling expenses had been paid, and they were to apply in future to their brother, who was supposed to be his sisters' universal provider, with very little perception on his part of what was due to him and them. In the middle of his dissatisfaction and laby rinth of difficulties, Jem had anticipated his sisters' earliest application by telling them gruffly the shops in Ashford at which it was desirable for them to deal, bidding them get what they wanted, and asking the bills to be sent to him. Thereupon Celia had walked into Ashford, dragging her sister, who was not nearly so good a walker, in her train, and had bought with a high hand all that the heart of a young woman could desire \u2014 procurable in a market town. The order had not been so very much after all, but it had been sufficient to frighten Lucy half out of her wits, and to prompt her to whisper faint-hearted remon strances, all in vain.

It was no good, so far as Lucy's exemption from blame and the preservation of her peace of mind were concerned, as Celia had ostenta tiously pointed out to her sister. When the bill was sent in, Jem, totally unused to such an item in his accounts and appalled by its size, growled as savagely as if the whole con tents of Worth's and Madame Elise's establish ments had been spirited down to Ashford and bought up piecemeal by his sisters, with Jem left to pay the debt. He did not take pains to investigate which sister was most to blame, or who had made the most reckless addi tions to her wardrobe.

It was easy for Jem to bluster and hector in this fashion. What was Lucy to do for the summer clothes which she did not possess ?

Her drawers were running over. She had not only levied a tax on Jem with disas trous heaviness ; during the short visit which the sisters had paid to their maternal uncle and aunt before coming to Blackhall, Celia, simply by pursuing her unhesitating tactics, had acquired a smart yachting costume, in addi tion to an enjoyable short holiday. The holiday was over, and the moor was not the sea, still the yachting dress was very useful and presentable, as Mrs. Reynolds would have said.

When the Miss Endicotts had been with their uncle and aunt, an invitation had come for the whole party to spend a day on board a yacht in order to follow the fortunes of a popular regatta. The invitation had been at once declined for the girls by their aunt, with the private explanation to their uncle which the sisters understood without being told. ' They have got no suitable dress ; we are not to rig them out afresh for the sake of one day's amusement. You and I will go, and the pair can be company for each other till we come back.' Lucy hung her head and submitted to the deprivation, which was no joke to a girl fresh from school, though it was a small matter to her middle-aged aunt."], [106, "94 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS Celia preserved an unruffled front \u2014 the more so, no doubt, because she calmly foresaw the sequel. In the course of the week which inter vened between the invitation and its fulfil ment, Celia so managed to assert herself and make the house unbearable for anybody who opposed her, that three days before the regatta the matron threw down her arms and told her husband she was going into the town to buy a proper dress for Celia. ' That girl will go with you to the Perrots' yacht,' she said decidedly, ' and I shall stay at home with her sister.' ' But why should you stay at home, if you thought of going?' inquired the astonished gentleman.

' ' But it is not right,' remonstrated the re presentative of John Bull, from a sense of outraged justice; 'it is rewarding the girl for her misconduct.' ' I know that,' owned his harassed wife, ' but I cannot help it. If that girl's father was like what she is, I should be loth to blame your miserable sister for doing anything she could to get out of his clutches ! ' So Celia had her day's holiday and the yachting costume, while Lucy went without because she was well-disposed and harm less.

From her own wealth she would have been willing to offer, in an insolently patronising fashion, a sash or a fichu, a pair of spare fresh gloves or a lace sunshade, to carry off Lucy's faded shabbiness. But Lucy had a little wounded spirit left which forced her to decline the fair show of generosity. Besides, she knew by hard experience what interest she would have to pay for it, how intolerable Celia could make life to those to whom she had granted a grace, with what strange perversity she would turn all at once and persecute those whom she had been seeming to favour. When Lucy rejected the compensation dangled within her reach, Celia simply sat and laughed at her sister's mortification, and took the trouble to point out the inconvenient proximity of one of the few surviving galas \u2014 if it could be called a gala \u2014 of the moor.

It was the annual dragging of Delaval Pool, so as to clear it from en croaching weed and rubbish for the rest of the season. Another object was to land the greatest catch of fish which could be found in its waters. The dragging ought, by the right law of dragging, to have been done considerably later in the season, when all summer growth was over ; but so cold was the normal tem perature of the water in this region, that licence was granted to the dragger to do his work in the height of the summer. It was said no mortal man could have dragged Delaval Pool for a period of hours in Sep tember or October and escaped the conse quences of his temerity. The only other country gathering which surpassed the pool dragging in popularity was the pony drift, for that part of the moor where all the ponies pasturing within certain limits, and the foals bred there, were driven by their owners and the moormen into an enclosure resembling a VOL. 11.

Both entertainments were purely local and smelt of the shop, as Celia said ; still, in the dearth of other public doings and merry makings, these two were not to be despised, particularly when they were attended by all the visitors and the country people from far and near, so that on each occasion there was at least a small crowd to laugh at and with, in contrast to the wonted solitude of the scene. The dragging of Delaval Pool, though it was not a private boon \u2014 being, in fact, a service done to the community, free to fish in the water or row on it \u2014 fell as a duty to the squire of Blackhall, on whose property the pool was situated. At the same time it was a necessity of the task that the man who under took it should be one of the strongest swimmers and the hardiest in enduring cold and wet in the district. For a number of years the service had"], [111, "'GET WHAT YOU WANT, I'LL PAY FOR IT' 99 been rendered by Hugh Endicott himself, and before his purse was empty and his hearth desolate he had gratified his hankering after popularity by summoning all who would join him of rich, poor, young, and old, to repair with him to Blackhall after his work was done, and feast ostensibly on the fish taken from the net and distributed among those who had any claim to the spoil, with a double portion to the dragger of the pool. Jem Endicott had taken his father's place in later years, and dragged the pool so as to keep it sweet and wholesome \u2014 a place for fishers and rowers during the remaining months of the season \u2014 while he had omitted the subsequent dubious hospitality. Certainly nobody had expected it from him while he hved a clownish, poverty-stricken bachelor in a corner of the old house. The year before the present there had been a difficulty ; the squire of Blackhall had been from home, on one of the solitary fishing excursions in which he indulged himself, about the usual time for H 2"], [112, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 100 the ceremony, and there seemed some danger of its being omitted. In that case the pool, as it was situated in a somewhat airless hollow in the middle of one of the oases of natural wood which diversified the bare expanse of the moor, ran a risk of getting choked up and becoming a dead sea of rotting vegetation. Then the parish and neighbourhood were electrified by the vicar's suddenly taking the vacant post, having received permission to do so from his parishioner Jem Endicott. Perhaps Miles North had an irresistible longing to exercise his muscular Christianity in some other fashion than in traversing the wildest portions of the moor near Oxcleeve, at all hours, in his pastor's capacity. Per haps he thought it might not be a bad thing to exhibit his physical strength and pluck in the eyes of a population with whom such gifts weighed heavily. It might not be quite so good in their eyes as to have joined in a famous day's hunt, kept up with the hounds and been in at the death after he had put"], [113, "GET WHAT YOU WANT, I'LL PA Y FOR IT' 101 his neck in jeopardy a score of times on the roughest hunting-ground in England, which only the Rev. Jack Russell or Jack Thomp son or Katerfelto's true master would have thought of using for such a purpose. But on the whole the dragging of Delaval Pool would better become the Rev. Miles's cloth, and would render him, should the enterprise be repeated, less liable to be censured by his bishop. Miles North did more than exhibit himself in boating flannels, wading, swimming, and dragging Delaval Pool in the presence of a concourse of spectators ; he made the act an excuse for entertaining the poorer of his people, together with their richer brethren, at a substantial dinner laid out on a long table in the vicarage garden. The proceeding would have been still more appreciated and enjoyed if there had not been a prevailing feeling among the entertained that they were on ' parson's ground.' They could not use any freedom with their pale-faced grave"], [114, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 102 young parson, who, though he was the right sort and good as gold, and though he tried to be social, did not have it in him, either in his bones or his skin. Therefore it behoved them to be on their best behaviour ; and though such a dinner was gratifying and grateful to them, best behaviour was fatiguing, above all if it had been maintained for a period of hours. As it happened, the vicar's dinner in honour of the dragging of the pool became awkward in the light of a precedent. This year Jem Endicott was at home, and would be sure to resent any proposal to appropriate his office \u2014 one of the few things left to him ; while a dinner or supper from him to the people was not to be thought of. At the same time the absence of what the vicar felt too late had been the injudicious revival of an old custom would be peculiarly galling to the principal performer as a betrayal of the nakedness of the land, where he was concerned. The Rev. Miles would wfllingly have done what"], [115, "' GET WHA T YOU WANT, I'LL PA Y FOR IT 103 he could to retrieve his blunder by giving the dinner while Jem Endicott dragged the pool \u2014 a division of responsibilities which, in spite of Tony's tricks, might have been conducive to the decorum of the company as well as to the excellence of the viands. But such a suggestion would be yet more offensive to the ruined squire. In his annoyance the vicar chanced to mention the matter to Lady Jones, and she stepped in, like a good angel, at the crisis. To his surprise and gratification she found an unthought-of escape from the predicament. ' Let me entertain the company,' she pressed eagerly, ' if it will be any relief and help to Mr. Endicott, and of course to you. You have received me kindly, and I have done nothing \u2014 nothing in the world in re turn. I should not think of it for a moment,' she continued earnestly, with the least shade of agitation disturbing her tranquillity, causing her hands to shake a httle as she clasped and unclasped them in her lap, and a degree"], [116, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 104 of tremulousness to come into her voice, ' if it were a different kind of party. It would be taking too much upon me \u2014 I who have not the ghost of a right to do so, and have refused to enter into society. But if this is, as I understand it, principally a gathering of simple homely folk from the village here and the village next to it, and from outlying farms on the moor, a mixed party of people who will not be particular with regard to whom they may meet any more than they Avould be in church, since they need never know each other afterwards, I think I might be allowed to do it.' ' My dear Lady Jones, why do you say \" allowed \" ? You are only a great deal too good and willing to be of use. It is we natives or far longer settled residents here who ought not to accept such a favour at your hands.

' But you see I have thought of it,' she said, with her quickly coming and going smile ; ' and I am quite equal to it, I assure you. When we were up the country in Australia we had often to show hospitality on a large rough scale to shepherds and drovers and their families ; of course they were our friends and neighbours, just as their masters were.'

The rooms in the Court are not large, but there is a number of them ; while the accommodation outside \u2014 the offices which have been turned into laundry, box-room, and harness-room \u2014 can easily be cleared out and made available.

The Court is really nearer Delaval Pool than Blackhall is, and much nearer than you must have found the vicarage surely. It is not un natural or unfit that I should entertain the village people, especially as I have been ac customed to such entertainments.' She spoke with a sudden assertion of dignity which made the puzzled vicar remember that she was the widow of a late governor of a considerable slice of Australia, and therefore really the per son of highest rank in the place. But the next moment she was pleading with her frank hu mility and strain of eagerness as if for an unde served privilege. ' You will let me do it, if it is to extricate anybody from a dilemma, if it is to save Jem Endicott, my landlord, from being exposed in his poverty and hurt in his pride.'"], [119, "' GE T WHA TYOU WANT, I'LL PA Y FOR IT ' 107 He did not know what to make of her, except that in the middle of her sedateness and sense she was full of impulsive good-will, lack of ceremony, and rash liberality. Why should she so glibly call her landlord, of whom she could know little or nothing, a young man so unlike her to boot, ' Jem Endicott ' ? It might be a free and easy colonial practice, but in a woman, a lady, it grated on his nice sense of what should be. He did not, after the fashion of Mrs. Reynolds, grudge Lady Jones's attentions to her landlord and his family ; on the contrary, he was deeply grate ful for them. He did not waver in his con viction that she was an excellent woman, superior in every way, a boon to him and his parish, but \u2014 he could not quite make her out. Lady Jones had her will. It created no little surprise, some censure, and a good deal of jubilation. Lucy Endicott's unhappiness on the great dress question culminated in view of the"], [120, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 108 dragging of Delaval Pool, in which her brother Jem was to be the principal figure, and the collation at the Court \u2014 ' a ghastly affair,' as Celia and Tony North called it \u2014 at which anybody and everybody might be present, where Lucy had a notion, which might have been a happy one in other cir cumstances, that she would be very welcome. Poor Lucy put an extraordinary value on fit and becoming clothes, though she neither would nor could have been guilty of Celia's mode of obtaining them. To Lucy, very shabby and inappropriate dress at any time was a positive degradation. It pained and shamed her, as Lady Jones, for instance, would not have been shamed, though she had been called on by a social revolution to walk abroad in Sally Beaver's canvas apron and sun-bonnet \u2014 according to Celia's graphic picture of what might be in store for her and Lucy. Lady Jones would have publicly worn a working woman's clothes with a certain quiet submission and simple uncon-"], [121, "' GET WHAT YOU WANT, I'LL PA Y FOR IT' 109 sciousness which would have changed their character. But the same philosophy was im possible for Lucy, especially where the case was not obligatory, where she might stay at home instead of going abroad. And the question was not of Sally Beaver's unvarnished homespun, but of Lucy's worn-out girhsh finery. She would sooner stay at home, dreary and full of trouble as that home was for her, much as she pined and longed for a change, for something to brighten the dulness and monotony of her daily life, and to make her forget the distress and fear into which some of Celia's escapades plunged her sister. It would have been the next thing to impos sible to make Lucy comprehend that it was she and not her clothes which would derive any profit from the performance at Delaval Pool, and that particularly with regard to Lady Jones it would be Lucy whom the lady would be glad to see, and not any suit Lucy might wear, though that suit had been com- posed of cloth of gold."], [122, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 110 CHAPTER XIX. NOTHING TO WEAR. 'I am afraid I must give it up,' said Lucy disconsolately, on returning from a last doleful inspection of the degenerated cashmere. Celia was her sole audience ; Sally Beaver had come into the room on some household errand in the middle of Lucy's lamentations, and had put in her word like an honest, un conventional old Devonshire lass. ' Nay, now, Miss Lucy, you bean't a-think ing of ztopping at home from the play when the measter will drag the pool like his fa ther afore him, as gin he were a dragon or a giant, and a mort of folk looking on?

' Oh, thanks, Sally, but I must do what I think is right ; I must give it up,' cried Lucy, anxious to smooth Celia's ruffled plumes, and with her own grievance not rendered less by the passing skirmish between Celia and Sally. Strife to Celia was like water to a duck ; even when she did not absolutely enjoy it, the natural element ran off her, as it were, without injuring her. But to Lucy strife was hateful \u2014 a rough wind which shook, tossed, and tore at her, from which she would fain"], [124, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 112 have flown away like king David's dove, and been at rest. ' Why don't you go into Ashford and buy something fit to wear ? ' suggested Celia cheer fully, after Sally had left the room. Celia was not lolling back in her chair on this occasion. She had a fit of industry upon her. When these fits occurred they proved beyond doubt what Celia could have done if she had liked, Lucy said with half envious admiration. But when Celia sat up right, and her white fingers holding the needle flew in and out of the cloth, it was never for such small domestic service as Lucy sought to render to the famdy sitting-room in her fiddle faddle mats and cushions. Celia's exertions were made solely and unblu shingly on her own behalf, as at the present moment, when she was engaged with a supply of elaborate frilling for her personal adornment. Lucy had once mildly hinted, ' Oh, Celia ! you work so fast and so well ; if you would help me, we might embroider a portiere and perhaps"], [125, "NOTHING TO WEAR 113 mantelpiece curtains such as we saw at Teign mouth. It would be such an improvement to this room.' ' Nonsense, child ! ' answered Ceha ; ' trash of slop worsted work, out of date already, dragged into all manner of shapes in the working, and disposed awry by an amateur upholstress, would not improve a place which is like a room in a third-rate farmhouse. When I have anything to do with work it must be irreproachable work of its kind. Besides, my labour and toil would lead to nothing. This is Jem's house. If it were mine, or if I meant to stay in it an hour longer than I could help, it might be different.' ' What do you mean to do ? ' inquired Lucy, puzzled. ' Nothing,' she said lightly. ' There is nothing that I know of to be done, save bide my time. Still, in the circumstances, I can afford to be supremely indifferent to the fact that so far from giving us satin and velvet with silks and gold thread \u2014 which, by-the- VOL. II. I"], [126, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 114 bye, would look very funny here \u2014 to work with, Jem would grudge the very needles and thimbles that might be worn out in the un dertaking.' Yet Celia had within this moment advised Lucy to go into Ashford and get fresh clothes at Jem's expense for the dragging of Delaval Pool and Lady Jones's party. 'How can I, Celia ? ' objected Lucy, open ing her baby blue eyes and speaking in accents of plaintive reproach. ' I'm sure you know very well I can't.' ' Well, I don't say Bliss is worth much,' answered Celia deliberately, while a pair of scissors with which she was clipping flashed here and there like lightning over her work, ' but for a small, easily pleased mind like yours I thought he might do the little job.

' I believe she is intimately ac quainted with what colours and stuffs are the fashion this year in Teheran and Ispahan.'

I have not been anywhere for an age \u2014 well, except that one little drive with Lady Jones.' She made the exception hurriedly, partly because Lucy was a con scientious young woman according to her hght, else she would not have made it at all, partly because she did not wish Ceha to ask questions about the drive. It had happened by the merest accident, and Celia was sup posed to know nothing of the encounter with the vicar and the visit in his company to his school, but she had not failed to resent the liberty.

Ceha prided herself on being acquainted with everything that passed around her \u2014 httle as she cared for what did not concern herself. Especially what Jem or Lucy did was not to be suffered to escape her. As a matter of fact, Celia had a marvellous faculty for worming out any thing kept hidden from her.

' None in the world. Has the parson been rating you for earthly-mindedness, that you put such a saintly question ? ' ' You know it is Jem,' cried Lucy pre cipitately. ' Jem !

She made her take material for a frock twice as expensive as Lucy had intended to get.

Then when she had got a tolerable article, it was utter waste as well as loss of caste to think of being her own dressmaker. Mrs. Denny was only a county town dressmaker, still she was a tradeswoman by nature and training.

Lady Jones was more put out by the threatened invasion of the Barneses than by anything which had gone before it. She stood hesitating, colouring high and muttering what sounded meaningless phrases of gratifica tion and gratitude. She had not counted on entertaining such guests with the others, she \u2014 she was afraid she could not do it. She could not make it pleasant for them. Mr. and Mrs. Barnes might regret having come. Mrs. Reynolds could not make her friend out. She had no resource save to refuse to see what it was not convenient for her to see, and to take refuge in clearing away in a general, indefinite manner what she could take for granted might be some of Lady Jones's scruples.

I cannot bear to look Mr. North in the face when I think of it. Yet I am thankful to say there is not a word against Gregory Barnes's moral character. My poor dear sister is much to be felt for, as it is ; I often tell her so ; but it would be too scandalous, too hideous a fall for one of my father's daughters if Mr. Barnes were a drunkard or a profligate.' Lady Jones interrupted her companion, not only with the unceremonious plain speak-"], [155, "THE DRAGGING OF DELAVAL POOL 143 ing in which she sometimes indulged, but with startling severity.

' Not at all,' said Mrs. Reynolds boldly. She was thoroughly mystified, but she could not at that moment afford to be offended, or to entertain doubts ; besides, she had not re covered from her surprise \u2014 she was still a little flurried.

This was conduct on her part which Mrs. Reynolds characterised afterwards as like that of a lunatic, seeing that his champion had never spoken to the assailed man, and that his supposed assailant was his wife's sister, who might surely be accredited with taking the best view of him in Mrs. Barnes's interest and her own.

' No,' said Lady Jones, more gently. ' If my landlord, who is to drag the pool, does not take the place which is his by right, the vicar has promised to preside; a clergyman goes everywhere and is never out of keeping.

The day for the dragging of Delaval Pool was auspicious, inasmuch as it was fair ; but it was a raw day, cloudy, and with a biting east wind sandwiched between the summer days which had gone before and were to come after it.

They came to witness Jem Endicott's feat in the first instance, and in the second to avail them selves of the hospitality of Lady Jones, who was throwing open her house to the public.

Its depth varied greatly, and it was furnished with a few pools within the pool, which according to popular repute were bottomless. It had to be navigated even in a rowing boat with some caution. For a man to wade it breast high, swimming whenever he got beyond his depth, with a net slung round his waist, which he was bound to drag in a long slant from one side of the pool to the other and back again, so as to take in every inch of the water and leave no part undragged, de manded an intimate acquaintance with the ground, and was a performance requiring both strength and skill.

Jem knew the pool from end to end, and so could calculate accurately both shoals and currents. But for Miles North, having a much more superficial familiarity with the spot and the service required, it had been an enterprise attended with greater risk. He had accom plished it successfully ; but he was sufficiently impressed by the difficulties he had sur mounted to induce him to appear again, to Jem's disgust, in boating flannels.

There were also the claimants from time immemorial of their share of the fish when the nets should be finally emptied, the farmers of this and that small outlying farm, in tongues of half-re claimed land projecting towards the pool, the widows of former farmers who held on by their late husbands' prerogatives, together with the poor of the district, the church warden for the poor of the parish, &c.

I am afraid Adeline only teases her some times ; a striking-looking woman, too, but so shy.' For Lady Jones hardly said a word ; though what she did say was all right, and perfectly courteous, Mrs. Reynolds told her self with a sigh of relief. ' A weeper on a gravestone ; but neither hiding her eyes nor putting out a torch,' said Greg Barnes, not very respectfuUy. ' I did not think that would have been to Madam Reynolds's taste.' But he had a better opinion of the stranger when George Fielding came up, and the two men took to discussing county matters, especially moor matters \u2014 all the pools which never went dry in summer, and never bore trustworthy ice in winter ; the strange birds which sometimes frequented them ; the progress of the trigonometrical survey, and the various tors on which the surveyors had camped ; the new fashion of Teignmouth men"], [177, "GREG BARNES AND HIS BELONGINGS 165 and Exeter men \u2014 aye, even of London men \u2014 coming and camping out for a week or a fortnight at a time on the great moor. She listened with her eyes cast down, and her hands holding the ponies' reins. She did not attempt to join in the conversation, into which Mrs. Barnes, and even the two girls, put an intelligent word now and then ; but her downcast face lighted up at the mention of this or that well-known name, Red Cap, Red Windows, Windy Gap, Cree Tor, &c, with their stirring associations to the speakers. Then one of the gentlemen told how Charlie Leveret's pony, which had been in a dog-cart carrying a pleasure party to Woolcombe, had been imprudently left tied to a stump while the members of the party hunted for ferns. The tempted animal, scenting freedom from afar, had broken loose, started off, harness and aU, and was not hkely to be heard of till the pony drift, while its abandoned freight had to trudge eight miles back on foot to Netherton."], [178, "166 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS The story was capped by narratives from Milly and Nettie Barnes, supporting each other, and taking the words out of each other's mouths. One of the long-horned Scotch cattle on the moor had met the Lacys' T-cart with the children. The brute had been irritated by their noise, had stood at bay, and at last had charged the cart, children, maids, groom, and all, until the Lacys' horse had been all but scared into leaping the traces, before the ox was sent off scouring the moor with only two feet on the ground and its tail in the air. Ned Dale had bought a drove of these cattle, and kept them locked up in his barn for a night ; but when he let them out in the morning, they knocked him down, ran right over his prostrate body, and he only got up in time to see them leap five stone walls in their course across the country. He thought that was enough. Happily he had not paid the former owner the purchase-money, so he sent to him that he was off from the baro-ain. The man to whom they had belonged and the"], [179, "GREG BARNES AND HIS BELONGINGS 167 moormen might whistle for the cattle, whose haunts they knew if any one did. ' She has some good stuff in her ; she is not so namby-pamby as I thought at first, and as her patroness would have had us believe,' Gregory Barnes came to the conclusion. ' She can't walk, poor thing ! so she's forced back on such poor fare as books and seams, with the purple and brown moor lying all around her. But her ponies are not badly adapted for moorland tracks, and she drives them wherever there is a track, I hear. I am not so sure that she hasn't been bred to the moors \u2014 Yorkshire, if not Devonshire. I say, Lady Jones, do you know anything of camping out?' ' Not here,' she said quickly ; ' in Aus- tralia.' ' Well, that may be the explanation,' he said aloud. ' I take it the scrub, or the bush, or for that matter the sand of the desert, is only another version of the heather and furze of the moor.'"], [180, "168 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS The girls, who had learned sedulously to avoid every elderly person except their father and mother, arrived in a fashion of their own at the same conclusion. Lady Jones, in spite of her widow's weeds and her lameness, was actually jolly, and not at all like their Aunt Adeline. ' Will you aUow us to stroke your ponies' noses ? We always hke to make the ac quaintance of strange ponies,' Nettie, the frankest of the two, had said experimentally, it is to be feared not without some idea of astonishing and scandahsing the strange lady, and with the confident expectation \u2014 the one part of the programme destined to be fulfilled \u2014 of hearing Mrs. Reynolds exclaim in dismay, ' Oh ! my dear girls, how can you propose such a thing or talk such nonsense ? What wdl Lady Jones think of you ? ' Whatever Lady Jones thought, she said cordially, with her sudden brief smile, 'Yes, do. And see, I keep some apples and pears in the chaise-pocket. Gooseberry pre-"], [181, "GREG BARNES AND HIS BELONGINGS 169 fers an apple, but Peascod rather hkes a pear.' ' Oh ! pray which is Gooseberry and which is Peascod ? Do tell us, and let us try them with the apples and pears,' cried the girls, eager to make the attempt and to sod and crumple their frocks, which had not cost them the elaborate calculations and wearing doubts and difficulties into which her frock had plunged Lucy Endicott. After five minutes the group broke up. Gre gory Barnes, who had no end of acquaintances among the country people, ' sighted ' this one, hailed that one, and started presently to make a round among his familiar cronies. His wife followed him at a little distance, accompanied by her sister. Mrs. Barnes had a burden on her usually easy mind. She had heard her husband cry, ' Hey for with you, Jem Endicott, my lad ! If it were not for this suit of clothes I've got into, I would lend you a hand. I've seen the day when neither tweeds nor broadcloth"], [182, "170 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS would have kept me back ; not though it had been the dress coat of the hunt in which I went to balls \u2014 when balls were in fashion ; I would have been in the thick of it. Your father would allow no intermeddling with what was his job, but you may not be so set up.' In spite of the morning suit and of his rheumatic knee, Mrs. Barnes was not at all sure that the ruling passion would not prevail, and her husband indulge in a mad escapade for his years, if she were not at hand to re monstrate, beseech, and turn him back. She knew that though he might have reached his threescore and ten in the parish register, in spirit he was the youngest man hovering on the edge of Delaval Pool. ' How does your husband get to know such people ? ' complained Mrs. Reynolds, not relishing having to toil with the faithful wife at the squire of Barnes Clyffe's heels.

Between you and me, Emily, it is a pity that Gregory Barnes has such common, low tastes.' ' I don't know what you call common and low,' retorted her sister, firing up on the great bone of contention between the two, the one subject of dispute which fairly roused Emily Barnes. ' These are Oxcleeve people and Barnes Clyffe neighbours, whom Gregory has known all his hfe. They must have been Dr. Reynolds's patients when he was alive.' ' Yes, dear, but patients and friends are different,' said the doctor's widow, with gentle emphasis. ' I should not care to have a doctor who was not my friend. You are always attacking Gregory for not being a fine gentleman, Adeline, but for my part I see no gentleman like him, and I know the girls think the same. He is entitled to speak to anybody he chooses to speak to.' ' Of course, and I am glad to say that he"], [184, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 172 is speaking to the vicar now. So nice of Mr. North to be so pleasant. Such good taste and good feeling on his part not to make any difference for your sake, and I may say mine \u2014 not to let Mr. Barnes see how reprehensible his clergyman considers his conduct, and what a bad example he feels that his chief pari shioner sets.' ' Bad example ! reprehensible ! ' cried the poor lady, getting scarlet again. ' Beally, Adeline, it is too bad. I wish you would be more careful what you say. I don't mind what fault you find with me or even with the girls, but I wish you would let my husband alone. Let him alone, did I say ? He deserves nothing but praise from you and everybody. Nobody knows that better than the vicar. I'll just tell you what you drove me into doing after the last time you spoke to me hke this. When I met Mr. North next it was in Ivy Lane, on my way to tell Polly Sykes that Mr. Barnes had got her grandson a place, and was going to send her a sack of potatoes. I"], [185, "GREG BARNES AND HIS BELONGINGS 173 went straight up to the vicar, and I said right out to him, before we could shake hands, \" Mr. North, I have something to ask you. Is it true that you call my husband an infidel ? \" ' ' \" An infidel ! no, indeed, Mrs. Barnes,\" he cried, as amazed and indignant as I was when I first heard it. \" There are points on which he and I differ, no doubt, but he is a dear Christian brother for all that.\" ' Wonderfully forbearing and magnani mous,' murmured the lady, convinced against her will. George Fielding had never ceased to be interested in the tenant of the Court, though he had not found many opportunities of cultivating her acquaintance hitherto. He was inclined to think that she shunned him as she shunned the rest of the world, except her landlord and his family. George stood a little longer beside her pony-carriage, and wondered what she was thinking of the whole affair. He said it was good of her to undertake to feed the holiday-makers in the"], [186, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 174 room of the squire of Blackhall, but she hardly gave him an answer, and her manner was certainly cold, while she did not so much as look into his dark, shrewd face. He pointed out to her Mr. Lacy, the sleeping button maker, in the most improved fashion of sombrero, which there was no sun to speak of to excuse. As he was a httle man his broad flapping hat made him look hke a mushroom or a tin tack, George remarked ; she gave him the faintest smile in reward. It was plain that Mr. Lacy's eccentricities did not have the smallest interest for her. She only woke up when she inquired if the lengthened exposure in the chill water of the pool, to which Jem Endicott was sentencing himself, might not be positively dangerous. ' Oh dear no ; Jem is hardy, if he has no other advantage,' he said carelessly ; ' so, for that matter, was his father before him. It took a good deal to kill poor old Endicott.' ' But this is not a question of killing,' she interrupted him, with sufficient fire at last on"], [187, "GREG BARNES AND HIS BELONGINGS 175 her lips and in her eyes. ' Why should he run any risk ? ' ' Why indeed ? ' asked George, shrugging his shoulders and hfting his eyebrows. ' The game is not worth the candle. If it must be gone through, it could as wed be done on a genial day \u2014 on any genial day. There is no obhgation on him or any other person to fix a day and collect a crowd to look on at the operation, which could be accomphshed as effectually, probably rather more so, in private as in pubhc. It is an old custom, and I fancy it is a point of honour to let the world see him play his part. In that case he must fix a day, and having fixed it, he must abide by it.' It was from the purest accident, and from no irresistible force of association, that he said the next moment, ' I see the school children have got a holiday. There is the Oxcleeve schoolmaster, and yonder is Tom Carew's daughter, North's pet scholar and little school mistress.'"], [188, "176 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS Lady Jones was not so indifferent to Kitty Carew as to Mr. Lacy in his extinguishing sombrero ; she not only looked round for Kitty, she sought to greet her. George Fielding became aware that Lady Jones had made the acquaintance of the schoolmistress. He was further sensible that Kitty evaded her ladyship's greeting. The next instant Lady Jones looked sharply at him, as if he had some meaning in his reference to Kitty's presence on the back of his remarks on Jem. He was innoCent, but he went on speaking in order to carry off the awkwardness of the implication. As usually happens in such a case, by id luck, or from a shade of annoyance and injured dignity at the gratuitous supposition, he made matters worse instead of better by hammering on at the same subject. ' Kitty Carew used to be a very pretty girl, but she is going off in her looks in an unusual way for a fresh young Devonshire lass.

She is hardly more than a girl, yet she looks haggard and worn.' ' Do you think so ? Have you noticed it ? ' she inquired with hurried earnestness. ' I never spoke to her till the other day,' she went on to explain, ' when I went into the school with the vicar and Miss Lucy Endicott to look at the pupfls' white seam.' ' Did Lucy Endicott really go there with you ? ' he exclaimed, off his guard, and speak ing on the impulse of the moment. ' Yes ; why not ? ' she demanded, with the same expression in her voice which had been in her eyes a moment before. 'It seems to me that there are unnecessary mysteries and difficulties made about trifles in Oxcleeve. For one thing, people speak of the Endicotts \u2014 my landlord and his family \u2014 as if they carried a pestilence in their skirts.'

It cannot have much custom, but, on the other hand, there cannot be any outlay to speak of. Still, may not some trouble in connection with her father's affairs be weighing on this girl Kitty Carew's mind and harassing her ? ' George looked incredulous. ' I have al ways understood Tom Carew to be well-to-do in his way, and she is his only child \u2014 a daughter he is known to be very proud of; whom he would have spoilt, I dare say, if the little schoolmistress would have let him.

' It should render her more independent of him,' said Lady Jones thoughtfully. ' Yes, and be a good thing for her if he should marry again, which, of course, is always possible, though I don't think he is casting sheep's eyes on his cousin, Miss Betsy \u2014 the present mistress of the inn. However, it may be a case of \"not Lancelot, but another,\" and Miss Kitty may have strong feelings on the score of step-mothers. The advent of one of these traduced women may be the single drop of gall which is embittering her entire cup and fretting away her beauty.

Lady Jones did not continue the conversa-"], [193, "GREG BARNES AND HIS BELONGINGS 181 tion, and presently her self-elected squire left her. Like Gregory Barnes, George Fielding had many old cronies and homely famihar friends met to inspect the dragging of Delaval Pool and eat their fill at Lady Jones's expense, and he was soon lost among them. Down by the water, Lucy Endicott, among a few other persons \u2014 mostly those who counted on their share of the fish when the more valuable spoil of the net was distributed \u2014 was still going before Jem and looking brightly back at him as if she were encouraging and luring him on. In point of fact, Jem wondered impatiently what the mischief Lucy was doing there, in that ridiculous white dress. He wished with all his heart that another woman would take her place \u2014 a little woman who never wore any thing smarter now, whatever she might have worn a year or two ago, than her school ginghams and serges. She went in them to church and market, and looked in them, to"], [194, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 182 Jem's mind, as no other girl looked, though people said her bloom was gone and she was as thin as a weasel. But it did not need Lucy to keep Kitty back; she would never come forward on her own account to greet him, he knew that well enough. Unless he plucked up courage and claimed her, she would die before she claimed him. It was disgracefully inobservant in Jem to undervalue Lucy on this occasion, and to fail to see how fair and sweet she looked, espe ciaUy after she was protected from the keen air by Lady Jones's soft white shawl. She might have been a white pigeon, pluming her feathers and tripping along on her dainty feet, more than keeping up with her brother as he tramped along, his stalwart shoulders pulled back by the strap across his breast, to which the net was fastened, his battered straw hat in danger of being blown off in the gusts of wind which hfted his hair beneath it, wet with the sweat of his toil, in spite of the cold ness of the day and the work, his hands a"], [195, "GREG BARNES AND HIS BELONGINGS 183 blue-red \u2014 ' hke lobsters,' Celia had commented; his bare feet the same, when he stepped on shore to make an alteration in his gear or to get a hght to the pipe which was his single solace.

She was only set at ease on his account when the Rev. Miles appeared on the scene in the boating flannels, which went well with his blonde hair and complexion and with a figure that was as muscular and flexible as when its owner was in training at his university. He looked as little discomposed as when he entered the chancel in his white surplice, though, if Lucy had guessed it, the vicar hanging about in his light clothing, and not Jem hard at work, though in icy cold water, ran the greater risk of being chilled to the marrow by the un toward east wind blowing across the moor."], [196, "184 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS Miles North strode into the water, notwith standing Jem's gruff disclaimer and dismissal of his vicar's offer, and freed the net when it was caught among tree-roots and stones. He slung the long strap over his own shoulders also, while his cousin Tony in his correct shooting-suit peered curiously from the shore at one of the successors of St. Peter marching side by side and keeping step with the refractory man. Miles swam when Jem swam, and recovered his footing as Jem recovered his, and went on unchecked and undaunted. Lucy Endicott thought Miles North was like a god among men, and felt inclined to wonder why all the world did not stop to applaud him. And she had not the least qualm for his safety.

From Jem he had only the most grudging acknowledgment of undesired, incongruous camaraderie. From the onlookers the man who appeared to have descended from his austere pedestal to inflict a needless penance on himself had no particular credit. Indeed, the Rev.

It made her hke a lamb after it had been washed in the Bar, and she was as gentle and defence less, appealing as irresistibly to a man's strength and independence.

He would fill a place among the ruck of the company or he would not be there at all. George Fielding had to keep the peace by stepping into the breach, and under taking, as the squire's agent, to support the vicar by taking the foot of the table. But Lady Jones did not seem to appreciate the sub stitute. She was so disconcerted at Jem Endicott's deserting her, by declining to fid one of the seats of honour and take a lead in the proceedings, that she threatened to follow his example. A feast in honour of the drag ging of Delaval Pool at which the dragger"], [202, "190 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS refused to show himself would be awkward ; but a feast minus its giver would be more awkward still. Other ladies had announced their intention to be present : Mrs. Barnes and Mrs. Reynolds, the Miss Endicotts, some of the summer strangers, including Mrs. Lacy's sisters, who did not trouble about a regular introduction and a special invitation. Their presence would render the absence of the hostess doubly marked, and still more un pardonable. She had intended to do a kind ness to the village and neighbourhood, she ought not to spoil it by refusing to coun tenance her own entertainment, though she might not choose to angle for popularity. It was only by urging these considerations on her that she was induced unwillingly to alter her hasty determination. This was the doing of George Fielding, who found himself called upon to enter the lists a second time that day with his hostess. He had been summoned by Mrs. Reynolds to her help, rather than that lady should sustain an ignoble defeat, which"], [203, "LADY JONES ENTERTAINS 191 she felt she must do if the widow of the late Australian governor betrayed so little sense of what was due to her guests.

But he did not find himself confronted with a perverse, unreasonable antagonist as he had been led to expect, only with a very sad and weary-looking woman in her widow's dress, having her white face turned away from him. ' Very well, then, Mr. Fielding ; if you think I ought to do it, then it shall be as you say,' she gave in with a sigh. It was as if she had once had spirit to fight her battles, but at last the strength was crushed out of her.

George Fielding knew the company would be greatly blamed for the singular omission, particularly if the day's proceedings got into the ' Ashford Chronicle ' without any previous warning, but he thought he could speak a word to the editor ; anyhow, there was no help for it.

He was sure her Majesty would have forgiven the liberty if she had known their dilemma.

Lucy, in conjunction with Milly and Nettie Barnes, was inaugurating a dozen half grown lads and girls into games of dominoes and similar simple diversions which had been prepared for their delectation.

It was a small mortification, but it rendered him less capable of forgetting the one spark of personal homage to the man apart from the clergyman, the one atom of personal gratification that he had received in the course of his day's work. It seemed to him that it was not to the Misses Barnes, though they were nice enough young girls and suited him fairly as school teachers, that he owed a debt of gratitude, any more than he owed it to Kitty Carew, who was his paid schoolmistress, or to Mrs. Reynolds, who would fain have con stituted herself general inspector and supreme judge of all his duties.

Lady Jones threw open the door as she spoke ; but the room was not empty, a young man and a young woman had taken the same route to the back of the house, probably unacquainted with the changes under the new regime, which had converted the old, half-ruinous, disused brewhouse into a modern laundry and wash-house in frequent operation.

George Fielding was thinking, with some indignation, that aU women were ahke. Lady Jones might be superior to the more rampant prejudices of the mass ; but she was a woman, and therefore instantly ranged herself on the man's side, and took Jem Endicott's part in the ill-omened transaction. What man witness ing the scene which they had just beheld would not at once have regarded Kitty, though she should have known better, as the real object of compassion ?

Good heavens ! that would be villany indeed, with a girl like her, even if you could suppose her capable of being made weak and wicked.' ' I beg your pardon, and hers and his also,' her ladyship said quite humbly. ' But you know there are very different standards of morals in the world. Remember I never thought he could do such a base thing, though he has his faults, as you say, and always shows his worst side to the world. Poor Jem Endicott !

' Jem is not found generally attractive, though he must have succeeded in turning so wise a head as that of Miss Kitty Carew ; but that is another matter. This woman at my side must have a large heart, poor thing ! with not many to fill the spare room which the late Sir Benjamin has left vacant. I wonder what sort of duffer he was, and if she was very fond of him ? He must have been very much older than she, notwithstanding her grey hair and helpless ness. Governors, like admirals, are not as a rule gay youths ; and he had to make his fortune first, I take it, in wool and tallow. He may have looked sharp, but he could not do it in a day.' His mind was distracted from the subject in hand by a habit he had learnt, which disposed him to pause for an instant and ponder on the woman in weeds at his side. She brought him back to his sheep with a quick run. ' But what does this which we have seen"], [223, "LADY JONES ENTERTAINS 211 mean ? ' she inquired in the most straight forward manner. He shrugged his shoulders. ' What in deed ? ' he echoed dryly, ' unless a couple of wasted lives and one broken heart or more. Mr. Jem Endicott is mad to entertain the idea of marriage at all, and in his pig-headed ness he has contemplated it in a quarter where it would be irremediable and utter ruin to him.' There was another pause while she sat and reflected on one of the pilgrim's seats in the porch, which had appeared so little likely to be sat upon ; he stood beside her waiting for an answer, and the geese hissed at the consultation outside the gate. ' I have been a good deal about in the world,' she said at last, ' and have learned in the colonies to look at some things differently from the way in which they are regarded at home. Jem Endicott has fallen and Tom Carew's daughter has risen in the world.

When it comes to that, Carew is a good old Devonshire name \u2014 as good as Endicott.' George laughed at her feminine inconsis- tency.

I don't think that Carew pretends to be even of yeoman descent \u2014 I believe his father was a groom \u2014 as it happens Tom rose in life before his daughter did. It may be an hereditary gift ; if so, no doubt it is a valuable inheritance. Tom Carew is a worthy fellow in his line, reasonable and well-to-do ; but if he were to take even a third of Jem Endicott's debts on his back they would soon fly away with Tom's modest savings. The only manner in which it could be managed would be for Jem to throw up his position as squire of Blackhall, gentle birth and breeding and all the rest of it, let the bondholders on his property take their pound of flesh till the whole was cut up ;"], [225, "LADY JONES ENTERTAINS 213 then he might go in for the inn and farming business as helper and successor to his father in-law.' ' That would never do,' said Lady Jones emphatically. ' No,' assented Fielding quietly. ' It might do in the colonies, as you are aware, but not here. There would be httle prospect of happiness. It would probably be doing for Jem in another way. Besides, what would become of his sisters? The fellow must consider them, now that he has taken the responsibility of them on his shoul ders, though, poor beggar, he had httle choice.' ' I don't know that they have considered him much \u2014 at least, not in the right way,' she said impatiently. ' Lucy is sweet and dear, and tries her best, but even she seems to have no notion of helping herself and reheving her brother.

The women are like ivy strangling and suffoca ting the men in the end.' ' Surely,' said George demurely. ' But the ways are not very easy, I suspect, and some young ladies find them hard to discover. As for these unfortunate Endicott girls, they have been heavily handicapped from the first : no home training, a stigma attached to their name, and Jem unfit to advise and help them. I wish Mrs. Hugh Endicott, and women like her who often get credit for goodness of heart and softness of temper, would, pause in their career of passion and cowardice, and calculate the punishment in flicted on the innocent children by the mother's headstrong determination not to endure any longer the consequences of her unutterable folly.

Lady Jones sat and heard him with bent head.

' All the same it was a fatal mistake,' he said with decision, ' for their own reputation, in the interests of the younger members of the family \u2014 even for Hugh Endicott, whom they abandoned to his fate.' ' But what could they have done for him,' she asked in troubled tones, ' when he was mad, as I have understood, against the wife and mother ? Why he might have murdered her some day.'

Fifty or sixty years ago science was less daring and triumphant, commentary and criticisms were comparatively timid and respectful, whde the great field of the supernatural, especially of the ghastly sort, was largely ignored and neglected save by the most primitive folk.

But to write and then print a tale \u2014 a plain, unvarnished tale of honest, practical, generally righteous disembodied spirits haunting the scenes of their former experience, to avenge crime, expose fraud, warn the unwary, check the evil-doer, repair neglect, comfort misery \u2014 would have been to issue productions certain to be relegated to the nursery or the kitchen, and covered with contempt in other quarters. The genius of Sir Walter Scott created the Bodach Glas, and compeded his readers to rise superior to the matter-of-fact standard of the time; but even Sir Walter's spell did not win much faith or favour for the White Lady of Avenel in ' The Monastery,' or the Bloody Finger in the ' Betrothed.'"], [233, "THE 'APPEARANCES' AT BLACKHALL 221 Now all this is changed.

She conformed to her husband's religion, and so incurred no per secution as a papist. She survived him, but as he died when he was absent in London, while she was staying at Blackhall, that amounts to proof positive that she did not make away with him ; besides, she had no conceivable reason for doing so. She had no stepchildren to cheat and persecute. Her own son succeeded to the property ; and she was held in sufficient respect and regard by her descendants to have her Spanish name descend among them, as Fielding says it did continue in the family, though the remem brance of the original bearer of the name may have died out.

' Well, I never heard of her before,' Lady Jones said again, shortly and simply, as if her ignorance was a marvel to be chronicled. ' My dear Lady Jones, how could you hear ? ' remonstrated Mrs. Reynolds, fitting her gloves more exactly on her fingers as she leant back in one arm-chair. The vicar lay back in another and twirled Lady Jones's whip, which she made a feint of using against Gooseberry and Peascod and had brought in with her from a drive. Her hands were tightly clasped in the heat of listening and she had sat down most indecorously, as Mrs. Reynolds was disposed to think, like a tall school-girl on a square stool.

' You are really only a new-comer,' went on Mrs. Reynolds blandly, ' though I am sure we regard you as a dear old friend. You yourself said, only a minute ago, that you did not believe the Endicotts themselves had ever heard a sydable of this absurd Spanish Madam. A foreigner whom nobody knew anything about,' morahsed the lady, ' a Roman Catholic originally, though supposed to have conformed to her husband's creed \u2014 that may account for something in later generations.

However,' as if with an effort to be judicial, ' we must remember that the late unfortunate Mrs. Endicott was not an Endicott by birth, and so could have had nothing to do with the Spanish Madam.' Lady Jones half rose, but sat down again when the vicar said in lower and graver tones than he had yet employed, with some thing of lurking personal consciousness in his voice, ' Fielding asserts that if any poor woman who ever had to do with the Endicotts possessed the will or the power to come out of her quiet grave and wander about her former haunts, there are others who had a better right \u2014 a great deal more reason \u2014 if suffering is to be counted a reason \u2014 for avail ing themselves of the privilege.'

Lady Jones spoke again, keeping, as she was wont to do, to the main thread of the conversation, while she indulged in a string of pertinent questions.

They may also have half forgotten her personahty or confused it with that of other and less happy women, who, hke her, bore the name of Endicott. If it is not so, he holds it as a proof of Devonshire stolidity that the natives have not invented a few crimes or sufferings which might have been either com mitted by her or inflicted on her. She ought, by this time, to have at least poisoned one or two of her neighbours or been secretly stran gled in her own person. By-the-by, I should have said that she crouches and shivers and spreads out her hands, as if she were in search of a blazing fire.' ' And who besides the Beavers saw her ?

It may only be that she believes in the appear ances, and is ashamed of her belief; but I suspect there is more in it than that.' Till now George Fielding had been con siderably amused in penetrating this out-of the-way, mysterious coiner of human expe rience. His shrewd face, with the candour of which he had been inclined to boast, had been ht up with quizzical fun as well as judicial acuteness. But now he began to look grave and worried.

On the other hand, the only other conclusion left him pointed to a dis tempered brain and a morbid imagination. He recalled all the remarkable examples of hysteria which he had come across in his reading, rather than in the practice of his profession ; all the stories of sleep-walkers, kleptomaniacs, fasting girls, deluded and deluding, blending themselves together in his memory in unwholesome and disastrous combination. He went back to the middle ages, and contemplated a grievous category of bewitched victims and nuns tormented by St. Vitus or something worse.

He would sooner have encountered all the ghosts in creation than have met with what was to him a still more baffling and tragic sequel. Who would have thought it of this mild specimen of humanity, this apparently good httle girl ? What was to become of the miserable girl if she had persuaded herself to play the ghost merely to terrify and torment her neighbours ? Was she, like Mrs. Siddons when she played Lady Macbeth and Queen Katherine, so carried away by her own rampant imagina tion \u2014 diseased in this instance \u2014 that she ceased to be herself for the time ? Was Lucy Endicott lost in the Spanish Madam from the moment that Lucy personated her ancestress ? He wished with all his heart that he had never told the Endicotts the story, sitting in that very sitting-room at Blackhall, and so started one of them on this mad career. But how could he foresee such a wretched, ghastly conclusion from so simple a beginning ? Were the misfortunes of the"], [278, "266 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS family never to end ? and what was this new grotesquely horrible thing which had befallen them ? Did the girl not quite know what she was doing ? Was she helped by the unconsciousness as well as the cunning of madness in the strange unaccountable pro ceeding ? Was it possible to believe her either bad or mad, sitting there busy dabbling in some woman's work, as usual, with such an air of girlish sincerity and modesty about her ? He had known her unhappy mother, but she would never have been capable of such conduet. He had known Joanna, but you might as well have accused her of lying and stealing. If he were right in his sus picions, what step would he be called on to take in the painful business ? George Fielding was glad of an inter ruption to his troubled thoughts. It came in the shape of Lady Jones driving up to the porch while he was still sitting with his teacup in his hand. Lucy was the first to see the visitor and"], [279, "RESTLESSNESS OF THE SPANISH MADAM 267 to start up to welcome her and bring her in. Lady Jones came in looking white and nervous, as she was apt to do when she entered a room in which several people were congregated, but with an eager questioning look in her grey eyes. She never failed to present a highly suggestive study to Fielding, and he was willing to be diverted by it from his earlier investigations, which had not to say palled on him ; he felt as if they had burned his fingers pretty smartly, and were likely to lead him where he did not care to go. But Lady Jones was also full of the ghost story. She began upon it the moment she had sat down, without the formality of a preface, before Lucy could spur on Sally Beaver to send in fresh tea. Her ladyship did not seem either to see or heed the dis composure of her special friend in the family, while she thus meddled in their private affairs. She showed almost as little tact as Mrs. Reynolds could have displayed when"], [280, "268 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS she began : ' What is this I hear about a ghost at Blackhall? Is it a fact that any body has been annoying you by playing so stale and impertinent a trick? What is the true story?' But even in Lady Jones's most abrupt utterances there was an earnest wist ful friendliness to her landlord's family never to be discovered in Mrs. Reynolds's animad versions. It was Celia who replied ; while Lucy kept repeating her offers of sugar, cream, and bread and butter in the most inconsequent, agitated manner. Ceha said airily, ' Oh dear ! has our ghost travelled as far as the Court, Lady Jones ? Well, after all, it shows it to be a well-informed ghost, correct in its data ; for I believe that first when the Court belonged to us Endicotts it became for a time a dowager house ; did it not, Mr. Fielding ?

Lady Jones was unlike Lucy Endicott in having a taste for ghost-stories ; she was stiU more unlike poor Lucy in not being intimidated and driven desperate by the idea of having to receive and entertain a spirit pure and simple. ' It has not been near me,' she said, with an indifference that had some scorn in it. ' But, pardon me, I came to put and not to answer questions. I wish to as certain from you, if you will allow me, the beginning and end of this ghost-story.' ' I hope you may,' said Celia with a light laugh. ' But you wid be a clever woman if you do. The truth is it has neither begin ning nor end. The Spanish Madam, or some body bearing a resemblance to her, who walked forty or fifty years ago, as collectors of foolish stories report,' with a mocking glance at George Fielding, 'walks again, by an eccentricity of taste, about the disused"], [282, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 270 and half ruinous quarters of this house. She may be there now, for anything I can tell. Would you like to go and see ? ' ended Celia defiantly. ' Yes, I should like to go,' said Lady Jones without a moment's hesitation, getting up, putting down her cup, and opening the room door, which was just behind her, before George Fielding could anticipate her. She passed out into the corridor, and took the opposite direction to that leading to the hall and the front door. ' Oh ! don't go there, Lady Jones,' be sought Lucy, in tones shrill and tremulous with more than one kind of terror. ' That is the way to the old rooms, but you will not be able to find it ; some of the windows of the corridor are boarded up, so that it is half dark. There are rats and bats \u2014 I never go there \u2014 and there are steps up and steps down, which may trip you and give you a bad fall.' Lady Jones went on undeterred. Instinc-"], [283, "RESTLESSNESS OF THE SPANISH MADAM 271 tively the others followed in a body. Celia did not care to conceal her surprise and resentment, though she had given the in vitation, not dreaming that it would be accepted. Lucy was trembling in every hmb. Fielding was occupied with a new and over whelming perplexity. Lady Jones did not move quickly, that was impossible for her, but her determination nerved her, so that she trod more firmly. Her tall figure was erect with a freedom of poise which might have belonged to it in the vigour of her youth. For the moment she had risen above her infirmity. There was no occasion for Lucy to scream out, ' Take care, Lady Jones, you are coming to a step,' though they had already passed one boarded window in the resounding emptiness of the corridor, and the light was growing dim. Lady Jones's foot took the step without any fumbhng or groping, and proceeded as before. It was George Fielding, walking after her, abreast of the two girls, who suddenly came"], [284, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 272 to a dead stop with a muffled adjuration. ' Good Lord ! ' he said. ' What is it ? ' cried Celia sharply. ' Oh ! Mr. Fielding, what is it ? ' implored Lucy, as both stopped. But Lady Jones was so intent in her pursuit of occult knowledge that she neither heard nor turned her head nor missed the others as she continued her course. ' Good heavens ! ' repeated George hoarsely, and the healthy hue of his dark face ebbed to a pallor that for the instant rivalled Lady Jones's paleness. ' Have you seen a ghost ? ' demanded Ceha, in the utmost impatience and disdain. 'Yes, I have,' he ejaculated with a smothered groan ; then he made a violent effort to recover the mastery over himself, and hastily, ' No. Don't mind what I said.' ' Come back, come back,' wailed Lucy. ' Call after Lady Jones, and perhaps she will listen to you and turn back.

I must try to overtake her, though I feel as if I should go out of my wits.' ' Don't be an idiot, Lucy. I think you are all going out of your wits. What ailed you, Mr. Fielding ? Did you feel ill ? ' ' I suppose so,' said George in a subdued, stupefied voice. ' One cannot always be well, can one ? Let us \u2014 let us follow Lady Jones. Don't alarm yourself, Miss Lucy, there is nothing more dreadful in the place than our selves. No harm will happen to Lady Jones ; she is able to find her way.' ' She must be like a cat, then, she must see in the dark,' said Ceha with her scoffing laugh. Lady Jones had reached the last of the disused rooms, and was standing in the middle of Beaver's tools and Sally's faggots when the others joined her. She was crushing up something in her hand, which she put into her pocket before anybody could see it, with out further explanation than the calm, cutting VOL. 11.

She was so engrossed by her statement that she did not notice any change in George Fielding, who hung back and made no re mark. Celia said with a drawl, ' We are much obliged to your ladyship.' Lucy cried, in a jumble of eager contradictory asseve rations, that she was glad and she was sorry \u2014 she meant sorry that there had been any question of a ghost, though she was convinced none would ever come again ; and she was glad on that account, and because nothing had happened to Lady Jones, who had be haved so courageously and unselfishly.

'Don't be too sure, Lucy,' said Celia in open derision."], [287, "RESTLESSNESS OF THE SPANISH MADAM 275 George Fielding did not hear them, he had not heard Lady Jones. He was failing to notice how Lucy behaved under the test. He had actually forgotten all about the Spanish Madam, except in reference to one person. What had happened to him had the curious effect of rendering him sarcastic, like Ceha Endicott, only it was secretly, not openly. ' Find her way ! ' he was saying to himself, ' I should think so, in her father's house. Why, she bears the very name of the Spanish woman, though she derived it directly from her father's mother, and might not have been acquainted with its origin.

He even went down with her to her pony carriage, and put her"], [289, "RESTLESSNESS OF THE SPANISH MADAM 277 into it with hands which he had a disturbed perception that he could not keep from tremb ling, though nobody save himself noticed it. Why should he be so moved? This woman was doubtless what she represented herself to be, the widow of Sir Benjamin Jones, formerly the governor of a province in Australia. He could see for himself that she was a white-haired infirm woman. He had nothing to do with her, unless as Jem Endicott's agent. She was a woman totally apart from any other woman he had ever known or been interested in. She was also a woman in independent circumstances, who could take care of herself, and evidently only wanted to be let alone. Still in a maze, Fielding went back into the house and took leave of Celia and Lucy, refusing to wait for Jem's return. When he got home to Ashford, he ate doggedly through his dinner, as became a man of his years, in order to recover his balance and to satisfy himself that he was not too much put"], [290, "278 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS out. It was also the best means to get rid of his servant's observation with the least trouble. Then George shut himself up from inter ruption, and set himself to review the posi tion, walking up and pacing down his hand some, heavily furnished old dining-room as the Lord of Burleigh paced his hall. He came to the conclusion that it was not for him to identify a woman who, though he could not say that she had attempted any further personal disguise than the great and grievous changes which time and trouble had wrought in her, certainly had not sought identification from him or from anybody else. How had Jem and his sisters failed to know her in spite of herself? It sounded very extraordinary ; but when George Fielding thought it over he took into account that Jem could not have been more than eleven or twelve years of age at the date of the last holidays which he had spent at home, when"], [291, "RESTLESSNESS OF THE SPANISH MADAM 279 he had last seen Joanna. The schoolboy had been fond of his big sister, nearly ten years his senior, as Fielding remembered ; but Jem had never been observant whether as boy or man, and the alteration in her had been enough to baffle older and clearer-sighted people. As for Celia and Lucy, they had been mere babies of six or seven when Joanna went away ; they could not, unless from some of those mystic thrills of blood which poets are fond of chronichng, have possibly recog nised their sister. All the old servants had been gone from the place for many a day ; and with regard to the old villagers and old neighbours hke Greg Barnes, who were less familiar with her than the Blackhall house hold had been, there was the great, incalcu lable change to blind and numb their senses.

It was not only in expressibly pitiful, it was incredible even yet. He did not see what good would be done, or how it could work anything save harm and pain, for him to come forward and reveal the secret which she had not chosen to impart to her nearest kindred.

But such grace is not granted to a prodigal daughter whose own father has condemned her, even though her prodigality has had its limits and has not been without excuse.

Intercourse with her, even the slight and superficial intercourse which it had been her will to establish between the old friends hitherto, would be extremely difficult for him now that he had seen through a millstone, now that he had solved the riddle ; but it could not be worse or half so bad for him than it must have been for her all along. She had been a woman of quick, passionate feel ings, which had not been crushed out of her, as he had already had sufficient proof now that he held the clue by which he could understand her sayings and doings.

She recollected Jem's birthday in the month of August so many weeks before the anni versary that she was supphed in time with the necessary gift, and had primed herself to present it, together with a sisterly kiss and a neat little speech expressive of her good wishes for many happy returns of the day."], [298, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 286 Now, if Jem did not exactly follow the examples of the patriarch Job and Dean Swift in cursing the hour in which his mother had brought a man-child into the world, he came perdously near to it on this morning in early autumn, when circumstances were bringing home to him with a force which they had not hitherto possessed that, in spite of his frantic efforts, he was a ruined man past remedy. He was neither the style of man nor in the condition of mind to look up blandly, and smilingly acknowledge the kind attention of one of the sisters who hung on his exhausted resources, after the nature of parasites, and were assisting in stifling him by their close embrace.

Or he may take Jem in hand again, though I must say I should not care to be the creditor. I have heard of bailiffs living years in a house, and everything going on just the same as where these objec tionable persons were conspicuous by their absence. I won't swear that it was not in Ireland, or that Tony North did not make a"], [310, "298 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS good story out of it. However, it will be time enough for you to cry out when the bailiffs are here, and when they have confis cated ad your precious pottering mats and cushions, your very personal property of work-basket, needles and thread, and thimble. What would become of you then, poor little dear ? ' Lucy was a little quieted and reassured by Celia's mingled sang froid and ridicule. But all the poor girl's fortitude was scattered to the winds by the receipt on her own part of a couple of businesslike letters from Bhss, the principal Ashford draper, and Mrs. Denny, the dressmaker. These worthy persons ap peared to be acting in concert, as if they smelt in common the bailiffs on the wind. For the couple pointedly summoned Lucy to settle her small account at her earliest con venience, Bliss only adding, by an after-thought of forced civility, that he himself had a large bid coming due within a few days. When a chance messenger brought the"], [311, "NOTHING TO PAY 299 duns' craving epistles Jem was out, a circum stance for which Lucy could not be too thankful. She was alone ; she had to put on her hat with trembling fingers and go out through the garden on to the moor to seek Celia, who was taking one of her consti tutionals, in order to ask that Job's comforter and dangerous adviser, while Lucy was in an agony of helplessness, compunction, and fright, what she .was to do in the strait. ' She will laugh at me,' moaned Lucy, as she stumbled in the direction first of one grey tor and then of another, so engrossed by her misery that she failed to see that some of her ordinary enemies the cattle were close to her, and might, had they so chosen, have made an end of her in no time. She was so bhnded by her tears and the throbbing headache they brought on that she could not even distin guish Celia walking not very far off, and allowing herself, for her own amusement, to be passed twice at a little distance as if she had been a bush or a boulder."], [312, "THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS 300 At last Lucy was so exhausted that she was ready to drop at her temptress's feet and do abjectly whatever Ceha deigned to suggest. As for profiting by the red flush of the heather, the golden glow of the furze, and the bracken already changing from green to russet, the whole brought out in perfection by a dappled sky, making great flecks of light and shade, with a breezy air stirring the long spikes of the foxglove, even the prickly arms of the brambles, Lucy knew nothing of what was around her. She was only sensible that her clothes were caught and torn, her very hands were pricked through her gloves, her weary feet were bruised by the uneven trackless ground and by the stones she did not go out of her way to avoid. She might have been in the dull, smoke-laden, walled-in prison of a town garden with the greatest rehef to her bodily sensations. ' She will laugh at me, and I dare not tell Jem when he is in such a humour and in such"], [313, "NOTHING TO PAY 301 trouble himself,' was still the burden of Lucy's tale. ' Oh ! what shad I do ? Though I sold everything I have in the world \u2014 my school prizes and the presents the girls gave me \u2014 the bangles Uncle and Aunt Lowndes sent me the Christmas before last, and the ulster Aunt Lowndes bought me because she said it would be serviceable (it might be if I ever wore it ; but I cannot do that, for it looks horrid \u2014 worse than a waterproof), I don't think I should get the money I owe \u2014 two pounds fifteen and two pounds five for the whole of them. And how could I sell my things ? Nobody buys old wardrobes at Oxcleeve ; I don't believe that Sally, even if she would keep my secret, could dispose of mine. , Oh dear ! Oh dear ! I wish I had never done it.

What would he think if he knew my frock was not paid for, and that I bought it without telling Jem ? I once heard Lady Jones say that she did not believe Mr. North would ever have college debts, like so many young men ; she thought he must always have had so much self-control. I am afraid it was very wrong, very wicked of me ; but I thought the stuff would not cost half so much, and I meant to be so clever and in- dustrious in making it up myself. I wish \u2014 I wish I had done it, and then there would not have been Mrs. Denny's two pound five though I do not see how I could have paid the two pounds fifteen any more than the other money in addition.

I am sure poor Jem thinks so too, or he would not be so miserable. All to get a new frock, a thing I could have done without, though I was very shabby, and I was happy when I wore it first.

Wishes were of smad avail after the deed was done, as many more than Lucy have found to their cost. When she did come up to Celia, sauntering along on a sheltered spot, Lucy was such a pitiable object that even Celia spared her for the moment. ' What have you been doing to yourself, you little goose ? Are the bailiffs no longer coming, but come ? I am sure they have not hurt a hair of your head, though they seem to have frightened you nearly out of your senses.

They ought to be ashamed of themselves, though the total had been three times as much. If I were you, Lucy, I should be ashamed of having such a miserably small bill ! Why, the one that Jem promised to pay for me, which was taken on in his name and handed over to- him, of course, was ever so much more.' ' Oh ! but you have not read Mr. Bliss's letter all through,' cried Lucy sorrowfully. ' Don't you see he says he has a large bill coming due which he needs my money to meet ? I am afraid, if he does not get it, he will be ruined too.' And Lucy's voice died away in a quaver of distress. VOL. II. X"], [318, "306 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS At last Celia threw back her head and laughed immoderately. ' Oh ! you innocent \u2014 you gaby \u2014 don't you know that large bills requiring to be paid within a certain time are, hke cheap sales and bankrupt stock, mere tools of trade ? I put myself to the trouble once to ask somebody about Bliss's circum stances \u2014 not with regard to paying him, cer tainly, but because I wished to know whether he was in a position to get a respectable class of goods. I was told he was remarkably well to-do. I should think he could lie out of a score of such pitifully small bills as yours for years, or for ever, without suffering the smallest inconvenience.' ' Then why does he write and tell stories about it ? ' asked Lucy, in righteous indigna tion. ' Because the people here are such mean cads, as Tony North says,' answered Celia care lessly. ' Perhaps we showed Bliss our hand too plainly \u2014 or he may have recalled the fact that the last squire of Blackhall took the"], [319, "A FRIEND (OR FOE) IN NEED 307 precaution of advertising in the Ashford news paper that he would not be accountable for any debts contracted by his wife.' Lucy hung her head, and made no reply. The next moment the spirit of mad fun which gloried in tormenting a hapless victim, and gloated in the suffering thus inflicted, took possession of Ceha. ' The question is not what will Bhss do, but what will you do, Lucy ? ' she began, with a capital assumption of grave sympathy. ' You must not be so disinterested \u2014 you must leave him to take care of himself, you must think of yourself. What is to become of you if he proceed to extremities ? I need not say this account and Mrs. Denny's little bill are made out in your name, so that they cannot come on Jem for the money, they must come on you. A brother is not forced to pay his sister's debts, as a husband is forced to pay his wife's unless he has publicly repudiated them in the way which was once done here,' said Celia again, with perfect composure. x 2"], [320, "308 THE BLACKHALL GHOSTS Lucy quailed and quivered anew, as she always did at these allusions, which were not so much allusions as taunts flung at her. One would have thought that any shame and pain thus wrought would have been shared by the sisters ; but the strange morbid de light in stinging Lucy in her defencelessness took the sting from the taunt where Ceha herself was concerned. 'The gist of the matter is,' Celia resumed her argument, ' the people whom you are owing must come on you.' ' But I have nothing, Celia,' pleaded Lucy, with imploring, panic stricken eyes ; ' you know I have only a few books and a trinket or two \u2014 my bangles and my locket, an old ring and brooch, the pencil-case Kate Bellew and Rose Powell gave me, and Marcia Ander son's fruit-knife.

' I suppose when you"], [321, "A FRIEND (OR FOE) IN NEED 309 have nothing they will try to get at your self.' ' How can they ? ' Lucy's shaking voice protested. ' What will they do to me ?

' People might cease to say ill of me, and rather be sorry for me after I was dead. I wish I were fit to die ; but I know I am not \u2014 far less so now than ever.' 'Don't talk stuff,' said Celia brusquely, with an unconfessed consciousness that she"], [323, "A FRIEND (OR FOE) IN NEED 311 had gone far enough ; ' don't talk in a manner only fit for some languishing sewing-girl or lackadaisical maid-of-ad-work.
