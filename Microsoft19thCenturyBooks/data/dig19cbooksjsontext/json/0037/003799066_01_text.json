The object of the \"Iron Roads Dictionary and Illustrated Route Chart \" is to provide a useful hand-book for all classes of the travelling public, and, it is hoped, will prove equally serviceable to men of business as to tourists and pleasure-seekers. The plan upon which it has been prepared facilitates reference to objects and places of interest in a manner not previously attempted. The valuable assistance rendered by the Chief Officials of the Railway com mands grateful acknowledgment. Much time and labour have been expended on the following pages, but the aid so cheerfully accorded by the servants of the \u2022Company has materially lightened the task of the Compiler, who has several times travelled over the mam line and its branches, and collected personally from every \u2022creditable source most of the information contained iu the book. It is possible that slight errors will be found, despite the care taken to prevent their intrusion ; but its contents, ss a whole, give grounds for the belief that it will afford the means of agreeably whiliug away the monotonous hours of a railway journey. The Compiler has also been indebted for some particulars to the Guides published many years ago by his friend Mr. Geo. Sami. Measom, who deservedly \u2022enjoys the reputation of being the first British Railway topographer. With this volume, those for the South Eastern and London Brighton and South Coast Railways are simultaneously published.

This Bailway was originally incorporated under the name of the \" East Kent\" by an Act of Parliament passed on the 4th of August, 1853, which authorised the making of a line from Strood to Canterbury, in continuation of the North Kent Branch of the South Eastern Railway, 29 miles in length, with short branches to Faversham Quay and Chilham. This portion of the line was opened for traffic on the 25th of January, 1858. Between the 4th of August, 1853, and the let of August, 1859, when an Act was obtained authorising the change of name from \" East Kent \" to \" London Chatham and Dover,\" the Company obtained, amongst other powers, those for extending the line from Canterbury to Dover (10th July, 1855), and for a new line from Strood to St. Mary Cray (23rd July, 1858). The Canterbury and Dover Extension (with the continuation to Dover Harbour and Admiralty Bier, about 17 miles in length), was opened for traffic on the 22nd of July, 1861. The Act of 1859 also effected the amalgamation of the original and Dover extension capitals. The Metropolitan extensions of the London Chatham and Dover Company were empowered by an Act passed on the Cth of August, 1S60. They comprise a Railway from Benge to Herne Hill, which is the point of junction for the East and West End traffic. The East route passes by Camberwell, Walworth, Blackfriars, and Ludgate Hill to junctions with the Metropolitan Bailway at Farringdon Street and Aldeisgate Street. The West route takes its course by Brixton, Clapham, and Wandsworth Road to Battersea, where it effects a junction with the system of the Victoria Station and Bimlico Bailway Company, and thence by way of York Road and Grosvenor Boad to Victoria Station. A junction Bailway was also authorised, which connects Brixton with Loughborough Boad, and thus affords direct communication between the East and West End termini. Barliamentary sanction was subsequently obtained for constructing certain short extensions and connections, and effecting slight alterations and modifications in previous places. Between the date of the Act by which the Metropolitan extensions were autho rised, and the end of the Barliamentary Session of 1^79, the Company secured individual powers, amongst others not availed of or abandoned, for the works undermentioned : \u2014"], [20, "X Date of Act.

The incorporation of the Sittingbourne and Sheerness Railway Company was dated the 7th of July, 1856 ; the line was vested by agreement in the London Chatham and Dover, by which Company it had been worked from the date of its completion, on the 19th of July, 1860 ; and by an Act passed on the 13th of July, 1866, the Sitting bourne and Sheerness Company was to be dissolved. The Mid Kent (Bromley to St. Mary Cray) Railway, incorporated 21st July, 1856, was leased by the powers conferred under an Act of tbe 7th of August, 1862, to the London Chatham and Dover Company for 999 years, at a rent equal to 4 per cent, on the share capital. An Act passed on the 17th of August, 1857, incorporated the Kent Coast Railway {Faversham to Heme Bay), which was successively extended to Margate, and Margate to Ramsgate. In 1871, by the authority of an Act passed on the 31st of July in that year, the Kent Coast was amalgamated with the London Chatham and Dover Railway. The Sevenoaks Railway was incorporated by an Act of August 1, 1859, and opened for traffic on the 2nd of June, 1862. The extension to Maidstone was authorised by an Act of July 17, 1862, and opened for traffic on the 1st of May, 1874. Both lines were originally worked by the London Chatham and Dover Company, but by an Act of July 21, 1879, these undertakings became vested in the Chatham Company. By the provisions of an Act passed on the 19th of July, 1875, the London Chatham and Dover Company purchased the undertaking of the Crystal Palace and South London Junction Railway(incorporated 17th July, 1862),with its extensions, &a. The Holborn Viaduct Railway and Station Company was authorised by an Act passed on the 13th of July, 1871. The property is owned by the London Chatham and Dover Company, and the magnificent hotel connected with the station is leased to Messrs. Spiers aud Pond. The use jointly with the Great Western Railway Company of the Victoria Station is secured by the London Chatham and Dover Company under an agreement. The extension which has been recently constructed by the London Chatham and Dover Company and the South Eastern Company from Dover to Deal, was autho rised by an Act of June 30th, 1874. It forms a junction with the first-named Company's main line in the parish of Buckland, between Kearsney and Dover Priory Stations, aud with the last-named Company's branch line at Deal. The ceremony of cutting the first sod of this railway (8J miles long) was performed by Earl Granville on the 29th of June, 1878. The condition of financial depression under which the London Chatham and Dover Company laboured from the year 1866 to 1870, was finally removed by the enactments of the \" Arbitration Act \" passed in 1869. By the first award of the arbitrators appointed under it, and dated ISth August, 1870, tho capital of the Com pany was defined as \u00a317,143,169, power being given by the second award, dated 24th February, 1871, to raise a further sum of \u00a31,000,000. The awards were confirmed in the same year (1871), and since that time the Company, under its present management, has continued to steadily prosper. The following Table will show the authorized capital and income, expenditure, and rate of interest for each half year from 1870 to 1879 inclusive : \u2014"], [21, "XI * Thi. dividend is on tne Arbitration Preforence Stock.

The Locomotive and Carnage Works of the Company are near Battersea Park Road. What may be properly termed the \" engineering feats \" in connection with the London Chatham and Dover system are numerous and important. Those of the \" Metropolitan Extension \" which includes the Thames Bridge (parallel with, and a few yards only from, the new Blackfriars foot and carriage bridge) are undoubtedly the principal. The bridge (of which the first stone was laid by Lord Sondes, chairman of the Company, on the 2nd of May, 1863), differs in many points from any other of the bridges spanning the river. Compared with those of Charing Cross and Cannon Street, it is widely held to be more pleasing in design, although from its close proximity to the road bridge, its effect is somewhat impaired. It is 933 feet in length between the spaces ofthe abutments, ihe spans being as follows : \u2014 side spans 100 feet ; intermediate spans 176 feet ; and the centre span 185 feet. The length of the abutments are 72 feet over all, and the girders, which rest on brick piers faced with the original stone of old Westminster Bridge, carry four lines of railway. The foundations of the bridge are composed of iron cylinders, filled in with concrete and cement, and sunk to a depth of 53 feet below Trinity high water mark, and about 20 feet into the bolid Lcndon clay. The bridge was opened for public traffic on the 21st December, 1864, but the first train entered the city over the bridge on the 6th October, 1864. The \"Metropolitan Extension\" also included the making of the roads from Herne Hill to the City and West End. The following figures, giving the quantities of ma terials used, will best illustrate the magnitude of the work. ] ,035,930 cubic yards of excavation. . 444,596 \u201e brickwork. 97,606 \u201e concrete 1 , r , , . \u201e\u201e.',(,, ,\", ,. , V for foundations. 28o,134 feet timber J 12,030 tons of iron girders, <fec, (in bridge). 227,687 sup. yards of asphalte (about 47 acres in all.) 4,235 tons of iron rails. 82,660 sleepers. 2,200 lineal yards of tunnel. 10,069 \u201e viaduct (comprising 742 brick arches aud 94 wrought-iron girder bridges). The road from Cold Harbour Lane (near Loughborough Junction) to the north side of Ludgato Hill is carried on a continuous viaduct ; nearly half the road from Herne Hill to the Junction with the Bimlico (Victoria Station) railway, is also carried on viaducts. The number of bricks used in the work was 117,838,000, or sufficient to form a pyramid exactly one half the lineal dimensions of the great pyramid. The works (including the Sydenham Hill Tunnel) were designed and carried out by the late Messrs. Jos. Cubitt and F. T. Turner (engineer-in-chief) and Mr. W. H. Thomas (resident engineer). The Medway Bridge, close to the Bochester and Strood station, is constructed of wrought-iron girders. Ithas one opening span of 60 feet in width, and three other spans measuring respectively 140 feet, 170 feet, and 140 feet each, running parallel with and about 25 feet from the new City Bridge, which was built about the same time. The foundations of the bridge had to be carried to a groat depth through bad soil before a stratum was reached of sufficient strength to carry the superstructure. sea-way is obtained, without sacri-icing tlie two necessary qualities of speed and solidity. The \" Calais- Douvres \" is 320 feet long and 62 feet in breadth, with a water-draught of 8 feet. She possesses engines of 700 horse-power nominal, but capable of being worked up to more than 4,000 horse-power. With the wind blowing heavily from the W.S.W., she has accomplished the passage in less time than the other boats in the service. The vessel has been specially overhauled Bince it was built, and it is believed will always accomplish the journey, under favourable conditions, in little more than one hour. She is constructed to carry 1,000 passengers, and can attain a speed of more than Iii miles per hour. There are four different saloons, one containing seven roomy private cabins, luxuriously fitted with sofas and tables. The upper deck extends acros i both vessels, whilst through a wooden gratino* in the middle can be seen the spray thrown up by the working paddle-wheels. The frontispiece is eugraved, by permission, from one that originally appeared in the pages of the \" Illus-ratcd London News.\""], [23, "XIII This depth varied considerably, the abutment on tho Strood side being sunk to a depth of 18 feet below low-water mark of spring tides \u2014 that on the Bochester sirle 27 feet \u2014 and the two intermediate piers being sunk 36 and 4 5 feet respectively below that level before the solid chalk was reached. These foundations consisted of cast iron cylinders, 7 feet in external diameter, cast in lengths of 9 feet, with internal flanges at each end by which they were bolted together, except in the case of each lower cylinder, which was formed with a slightly belled mouth, and with a sharp cutting edge to enable it more readily to force its way through the ground. It being known from the experience gained in the construc'ion of the adjoining City Bridge, which had been built with cylinders, lhat tl.e ground was of such a nature, and in places so full of obstructions, that the lower edge or \"lip\" of the cylinder would not in all cases embed itself in the ground with sufficient regularity to keep the water from entering underneath it\u2014 a plan of sinking the cylinders was adopted which had first been introduced wiih marked success in the construction of tbe City Bridge, and has since been successfully resorted to in many analogous cases. The bottom cylinder having been put in place, or \" pitched \" in the required posi tion between temporary guide piles, other lengths were put on to it until a sufficient number were so placed as to bring the uppeimost one to a convenient height above high-water mark, when an air-tighe top, provided with what might be called air loc'is to admit of the passage in and out of men and materials, was put on, and, all the joints being caulked and made thoroughly air and water tight, air was pumped iuto the cylinder, which drove the water out at the bottom, and as long as it vas main tained at a sufficient pressure kept it out, so lhat men could work easilv at the bottom, the excavated earth being hoisted up inside the cylinder, and passed out through the air locks above referred to, the cylinders following the excavation until the proper depth was reached, when the extra lengths which had been put on at top were taken ofl, leaving the top of the one intended to remain a little above low water of spring tides ; it was then filled up with Bortland cement concrete, and covered with a large block of Bramley Fall stone, which, when all the cylinders were sunk and similarly treated, was dressed down to receive large cast-iron cellular bed plates, strongly bolted together, on which the piers and abutments were built up in the ordinaiy way with brick and stone work. The superstructure consists of three wrought-iron plate girders, between which the trains run supported on cross timbers suspended to the lower flanges of the girders. The bridge was designed by and built under the superintendence of the late Mr. Joseph Cubitt, Mr. William Mills being the resident engineer, and Messrs. Fox and Henderson the contractors. The entire cost was \u00a364,0u0. Of the tunnels on the Bailway, fourteen in number, those of Sydenham Hill and Shepherd's Well are the longest and most interesting from the \"constructor's \" point of view. The former is 2,200 yards in length, and throughout traverses the London clay. The brick lining varies in thickness from 3ft. to 5ft. 3in., and in places where the ground was very heavy, blue Staffordshire bricks were laid to a thickness of 3fl. Shepherd's Well Tunnel (between Canterbury and Dover) is 2,376 yards long, and cut through solid chalk, so firm as to require no brick lining except in the arches. The Victoria Railway Bridge is so intimately associated with the working of the London Chatham aud Dover system, that a lew particulars respecting it aro not inappropriately placed here. The first stone of the original bridge was laid on the Oih of June, 1859. It crosses the Thames about 150 yards to the eastward of Chelsea Suspension Bridge at a point where the width of the water-way is 740 feet. It consists of four segmented wrought-iron arches, each having a span of 175 feet, and a headway of 22 feet above Trinity high- water level. At the northern end a land nrch of 70 feet span crosses the Grosvenor Boad, and at the southern end a corre sponding arch of 65 feet span crosses the wharves of the Brighton Bailway Company. The piers are of brick faced with stone. The bridge, which cost \u00a384,000, and sup ported two lines of railway, was opened for traffic on the 9th of June, 1860, just twelve months from its commencement. It contained the following quantities of materials : \u2014"], [24, "XIV 16,800 cubic feet of timber, in floors 10,700 girt landings 5,750 cubic yards of concrete 6,500 \u201e \u201e brickwork 23,587 \u201e \u201e Portland stone 57,205 \u201e \u201e Bramley Fall stone 1,349 tons of wrought iron 204 \u201e cast iron 15J \u201e steel keys and collars. The bridge was designed by Mr. John Fowler, Pre*,' \"'ent Inst. C.E., and con structed by Mr. John Kelk, M.P., under the supervision of Mr. William Wilson. The rapid increase in the traffic to the Victoria Station, used as it was by several companies, soon necessitated further facilities for meeting its claims, and in 1862 it was determined to widen the approaches to the station, and also the bridge, from the designs of Sir Charles Fox. The first stone of the extension was laid on the 22nd of February, 1865, the widening being carried out at the joint expense of the London Chatham and Dover and the London Brighton and South Coast Railway Companies. The bridge now carries seven lines of rails and two platforms. The por tion of the bridge carrying the platforms is so arranged that the addition of another rib in each span will allow of three more lines of way, making ten in all. The materials used in tho widening were as follows : \u2014 286,000 cubic feet of timber. 220 tons of bolts and spikes in ditto. 20,350 cubic yards of excavation. 8,350 \u201e \u201e concrete. 13,800 \u201e \u201e brickwork. 39,900 \u201e feet of Portland stone. 52,300 \u201e \u201e Bramley Fall stone. 885 tons of cast iron. 3,541 \u201e wrought iron. The cost of the alterations was \u00a3161,000, making the total cost of the bridge \u00a3245,000. It was certified as fit for traffic by the Board of Trade on the 1st of August, 186C. The contractors were Messrs. Peto, Betts ife Co., Lucas Brothers, and W. and J. Pickering, who worked under the superintendence of Sir Charles Fox, Mr. Charles D. Fox, and Mr. E. Wragge (the resident engineer). Although the smallest in mileage extent of the English trunk railways, the London Chatham and Dover, by being in possession of the shortest sea passage to the Con tinent, is second to none in the importance and proportionate value of its traffic. The line is greatly favoured in passing through a portion of the country rich in historic interest, beautiful scenery, and industrial activity.

USEFUL HINTS TO CONTINENTAL TRAVELLEBS. Conversation. \u2014 English is spoken in most of the Continental Hotels, and there are interpreters at all the principal stations. Passports are not required by travellers of British nationality, except in Portugal , Bussia, and Turkey, but they are always useful to establish identity and aie recommended. The Registration of Baogage saves the passenger from all trouble and expense of landing and shipping the baggage and conveying it between the train and boat, harbour dues, and other imposts hitherto made ; secures an allowance (25 kilos, or 56 lbs.) of baggage free of charge ; also the privilege of paying before departure the charge for the conveyance of excess baggage, according to a fixed through rate. Th:\u00bb registration may be made as under : \u2014"], [27, "XVII In travelling from Brussels to Cologne by express train, if the luggage is regis- tered it is examined by the German Customs at Cologne, if unregistered ac Verviers. In travelling from Cologne to Brussels or Antwerp, luggage is examined at Verviers. In travelling between Cologne and Rotterdam or Amsterdam, luggage is examined at Zevenaar. Luggage registered through from London to Paris is examined on arrival at Paris ; if not registered through, it is examined at the landing port. Lug- gage cannot be registered from London beyond Paris ; Luggage coming from Swit- aerland is examined at the frontiers of the neighbouring States. Luggage may be registered through from Paris to Turin or Milan and examined at Modaue, and coming from Turin it is examined at Modane, or in some cases it is examined on arrival at Paris. In returning from the Continent to London via Dover the luggage is examined at Dover on Sunday mornings whenever the arrival at that place occurs between the Saturday and Sunday afternoon ordinary services. Where the passenger intends to stop short of the final destination shown by his through ticket, he should register only to the first point at which he desires to break the journey. Baggage is registered by all through services, but only on the production of tbe passenger's through ticket at the registration office ten minutes before the time fixed for the departure of the train. Passengers are recommended to register their baggage in all cases by the mail trains, otherwise it may be detained at the landing port for the following train. The Railwaj' Company does not undertake to register baggage unless the passenger, with the baggage and through ticket, be on the platform of the station ten minutes in advance of the time fixed for the departure of the train. The baggage ticket must be given up before the baggage can be delivered at destination. Each package should have the name and address of the owner distinctly marked thereon, and all old luggage labels should be removed. Merchandise registered as baggage is liable to detention and seizure by the Customs ; and passengers are cautioned against registering articles of the description of mer chandise, or that are not for personal use. Passengers should personally claim their baggage on arriving at the point to which registered, and give notice immediately to the station master if anything is wrong, giving a description and list of tho contents of any packages missing. Customs Examination. \u2014 Passengers are required to be present at the examina- tion of their baggage by the Customs officers at the different frontiers. The com panies do not undertake any duty in collection with such examination on the Continent, nor to be responsible for same, nor for any delay or loss arising from passengers not having been present at the examination at any of the Custom House towns named herein. Passengers should especially note that baggage registered for the German stations will not be foiwarded beyond Aix-la- Chapelle or Cologne until examined by the Customs there, which can only be done in the presence of the owner or Destination.

The owner is liable in Belgium and Germany to a duty of about ls. 6d. per 100 lbs. weight. Passengers who register their baggage for Cologne, and who subsequently desire to have it at Brussels, should claim it at Blandain or Mous cron, where, as a favour, it may be given up by the station master. At Lille, pas sengers are required to say by what route they wish to proceed \u2014 either via Ghent or Tournay \u2014 in order that the baggage may be put in the proper wagon. Baggage registered from Baris to London by the night services is examined at Dover. Baggage being conveyed from the east westward, destined for Belgium, is examined at Verviers. Baggage passing through Belgium for either France or England, is not examined at all by the Belgian Customs. Baggage registered to Dover must be de clared at starting for one or the other of the Custom houses there, whether the Lon don Chatham and Dover or the South Eastern. Baggage registered at Cologne for London is examined at Verviers, should the traveller subsequently determine on stopping in Belgium. If desirous to stop in France, his baggage is examined there, and not in Belgium. Baggage from Belgium booked direct to England via Calais, by Ghent and Mouscron, or by Tournay and Blandain, is free from examina tion at the French frontiers. It is examined at London in all cases when regis tered thereto, except where conveyed by the boat leaving Ostend at 8.0 p.m., when it is examined at Dover ; unless the passenger elects to have it forwarded by the 4.15 a.in. train from Dover, in which case it is examined at London, if registered thereto. Where there is time, the baggage can be examined at Dover, if so desired by the owners. When the arrival in England takes place on Sundays, the Customs' examination is made at the port of arrival, except baggage registered to Charing Cross arriving on Sunday afternoon, which is examined the same as on week days at London. Notwithstanding tho above regulations, all trunks or parcels which have to pass a frontier, must be given up at starting, and are conveyed in the Customs' truck. This regulation applies even to hat boxes and necessaries. Any luggage kept in the carriages up to any frontier town \u2014 for instance, Verviers \u2014 must be re-booked there, and is sent on by an after train, as express goods. Some French Goods \u2014 as New Clothes, Millinery, Frinted or Dyed Cotton, Woollen and Linen Fabrics, Silk, &c. \u2014 are charged at a reduced rate of duty on entering Belgium. But to obtain this reduction, it is necessary to have a certificate, termed \" certificat d'origine \" from the French Customs, and to present this with the goods at the Belgian Customs. On this system, Silk, for instance, pays four francs instead of 10 for each kilogramme. Travellers can obtain the necessary paper at the Bureau de la Douanc, at Baris. All packages of luggage registered from abroad, if not cleared from the Custom House on the day of arrival, are deposited in the Customs baggage warehouse, and charged for at the rate of 1 d. per package per day. The Mail Boats and Mail Trains do not wait for Passengers or Baggage after the Mails are loaded. The other Trains and Boats do not await each other when detained by stress of weather or casualty. Passengers to Paris or Brussels by the Mail Services should be careful to ascertain that they enter the right train at Calais. The Paris night mail train leaves first, and the Brussels train a few minutes later ; but the day mail for Brussels leaves first. French Money Exchanges can be obtained in exchange for English Money, at the rate of 25 fr. for one sovereign, on application at the Harbour Station, Dover. There is also an Exchange Office in the Station at Calais. Tickets to be kept in Readiness.-\u2014 Passengers should have their Tickets ready to show at the Stair-landing at the Steam Boats, before going on board, and to deliver on leaving the Boats. English Customs.\u2014 Foreign Goods, subject to duty, packed within articles of apparel, or otherwise concealed, are, as well as the articles in which they may be placed, liable to forfeiture, and Fassengers are therefore apprised that the forfeiture m all such cases will be strictly enforced, unless the attention of the examining officer be called thereto, and the Goods didy declared previously to the opening of the Packages."], [29, "XIX Smoking is prohibited in the carriages, except in the compartments set apart for the purpose. A Carriage for the exclusive use of Ladies is reserved both on the London Chatham and Dover and Northern of France Eailways. Coupe Carriages. \u2014 On the Northern of France Bailway Bassengers travelling in Coupe- Carriages are required to pay extra Fare for the accommodation, according to distance. Invalid Carriages. \u2014 On the Northern of France, and also the Lyons Badway, there are \" Coupes lits \" for sick travellers. The Ordinary Carriage on the Northern has places for eight passengers. Passengers should be at the Station fifteen minutes before the time of starting, ani be provided with the exact amount of their fare, to avoid the delay caused by receiving change. Luggage should be taken to the station a quarter of an hour before the time of starting. It can be insured by payment of an additional sum of ten centimes on 100 francs worth. Travellers should remove all old addresses, and have their own very legibly written. They may not take any luggage into the carriage weighing more than 50 lbs., and only such as can be placed under the seats without inconve nience. SUGGESTIONS FOR VISITORS TO FRANCE AND THE FRENCH CAPITAL. Demeanour. \u2014 To insure that world-renowned civility from French servants, officials and others, the visitor should be thoroughly courteous when making a request, or even when ordering refreshments at a cafe\" or restaurant. It is customary to address even persons of the lower classes as Monsieur, Madame, or Mademoiselle. The policemen, who are to be met with in every street and place of public resort, are always ready to furnish strangers with every information in their power. Cabs and Public Carriages. \u2014 Paris is well supplied with public carriages of all kinds. The omnibuses are numerous and well-conducted, but slow. The price is 30 c. (3d.) for the inside places, and 15 c. for the outside (impe'riale). Almost all are in correspondence, and the passengers may claim a ticket of correspondence to go on by another omnibus if the one he gets into does not reach his destination. Care -should be taken to tell the conductor on entering what part of Paris it is desired to reach. The omnibuses of the various lines are all indicated by letters of the alphabet, and colours. These different colours are used in the various quarters or \u2022divisions of Paris for all public purposes. For sia cres or cabs, the fares are about \u2022one shilling for the course, as it is called, if not exceeding a quarter of an hour, and a little more for the longer courses. The price per hour is 2 frs. Full statements of the fares will be found suspended in all the carriages, and the driver must give the passeEger a printed ticket of particulars, &c. The prices are nearly double between midnight and 6 a.m. in summer, or 7 a.m. in winter. Besides the jiacres (or voitures de place), there are a somewhat superior class of vehicles, belonging to private individuals, and known as voitures de remise. They are better fitted and travel more quickly. The fare for the short course is 1 fr. 50 c, for the longer 2 frs. By the hour 2 fr. 25 c. The visitor to Baris should learn the colour that belongs to the lanterns of the quarter of the city he resides in, and select cabs with lanterns of this colour on returning home. Places of Amusement. \u2014 The following establishments are the most frequented : \u2014 Conservatoire de Musiqsie (classical music); Herz, Sainte -Cc'cile, Pre' Catelan, Erard, Pleyel and Sax concert halls. The concerts of the Cafes Chantants are of an inferior description. Those in the Champ-Elysdes attract numerous visitors in summer. The following are among the best establishments : Eldorado, Alcazar,"], [30, "XX Cafe- Concert Bataclan, and Grand Concert Parisien. Of Soirees Musicales et Dansantes, the most frequented in summer are Jardin Mabillc (balls on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays ; admission, 3 and 5 francs) ; Closerie des Lilas, (Jardin Bullier) ; the Chateau Rouge. In winter : Salle Valentino Casino, rue Cadet; Ely see Montmartre. The Cascade Cafe, in tho Bois de Boulogne, and the Casino d'Asnieres are favourite summer resorts. The Mashed Balls of the Grand Opera last from the middle of December till Lent, and take place every Saturday evening (admission 10 fr.). Theatres. \u2014 There are nearly 50 in Paris. The performances commence at various hours between 6 and 8 o'clock, and last till midnight. The best places are the stalls in front of the orchestra (fauteuils d' orchestre) , behind which are the stalks d'orchestre ; those behind the pit (stalles d'amphithe'dtre), and those in front of the first tier of boxes (fauteuils de balcon, de la premiere galerie). Ladies are not admitted in some thoatres to the orchestra stalls. In the case of popular performances, seats should be secured by purchasing billets de location beforehand at the location office des theatres. These billets cost 1 or 2 francs more than those bought at the door, but the purchaser thereby reserves his seat. Hotels, Cafes, and Restaurants. \u2014 Although attendance is always an item in the hotel-bill, it is usual to give the head-waiter and the concierge a fee of 1 or 2 frs. per week, and the under- waiter by whom the traveller has been served, about 2 frs. In a few instances the payment for service is left to tho discretion of the traveller, who is expected to give J or 1 fr. dady. Au occasional extra gratuity will greatly tend to ensure civility. Visitors should avoid keeping articles of value in the drawers or cupboards of their rooms. They should be entrusted to the care of the landlord, or sent to a banker. The cafes of Paris are one of the characteristic features of the city. They are to be found in all quarters of the town, and some are fitted up with great splendour. They are adapted for the entertainment of all classes of society. Billiards, cribbage and dominoes are allowed in Barisian c&Us. The traveller should select restaurants of the best class, at which a simple repast of 2 or 3 courses may be obtained for a reasonable sum. The visitor is not expected to drink expensive wines. The waiter expects about 1 sou on each franc spent. Ladies can dine at restaurants without attracting the observation which is so noticeable in London establishments. Money, Weights, and Measures. \u2014 The French coinage is very simple, and easily understood ; it is divided into tenths, on the decimal system. The coins consist of centimes (a \"sous\" is equal to 5 centimes), and francs. 100 centimes (or 20 sous) make a franc. 20 franc gold pieces were formerly styled Napoleons. For all ordinary dealings the visitor may calculate the franc as worth lOd. in English money. As the franc is actually worth only 9-^d., if a halfpenny be taken off the value of each franc in making a\" calculation, the exact British equivalent will be found. The coinage system of Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland are similar to those of France, and equivalent in value. The franc becomes lira (singular), and lire (plural) ; the centime, centesimi, in Italian. In Holland 5 cents are about equivalent to Id. ; 1 florin or guilder (100 cents) to about ls. 7d.; 1 gold ducat to about 9s. 4d.; and 1 gold 10 florin piece to about 16s. 6d. In Germany 12 pfennige are about equivalent to Id, ; 1 mark flOO pfennige) to ls. ; 20-mark piece (gold) to \u00a31. The kilogramme, or kilo, as it is generally called, is the French ordinary weight I y which goods sold by weight are quoted. It is equal to 2 lb3. 3 J ozs. avoirdupois ; a pound of any article is nearly equivalent to about a demi-kilo, which is 1 lb. li oz. avoirdupois. The unit of length is the metre, which is about 39 inches English ; 6\u00a3 metres, nearly 6 yards; 10 metres, 11 yards. The metre is divided into 100 centimetres. The kilometre is the road measure\u2014 3 miles are equal nearly to 5 kilometres ; 8 kilometres are 5 miles ; 10 kilometres are 6} miles ; 100 kilometres, 63 miles. The same measurement is also used in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Liquid and dry measures are calculated by the litre, about If pint. Ad ordinary \"rench wiiio bottle contains about a litre."], [31, "XXI LONDON HACKNEY CAERIAGE REGULATIONS, AND LIST OF FARES, TO AND FROM THE PRINCIPAL RAILWAY STATIONS TO THE POINTS NAMED.

The quarter sessions for the eastern divi sion of the county are held here. The origin of the city of Canterbury is far beyond the era of authentic British history. Most probably it was a seat of superstition, and a principal scene of Druidic barbarity, long before the Christian era. Under the Roman rule it increased its importance from the circumstance of its being on the great high-road to the continent. By them it was called ' Durovernum,' and at the time of the Heptarchy became the capi tal of the county, under the name of ' Cant-wara-byrig ' or 'Kentish men's borough.' fiengist and Horsa were entertained here by Vortigern, who after wards took possession of the city ; and Hengist kept his court here, as did his successors of the kingdom of Kent, amongst whom was Ethelbert, the first royal convert of Saxon England to Christianity. The city was burnt and rebuilt several times during the conflicts with the Danes, who, it is believed, threw up the mound called ' The Dane John,' for military purposes. During the Plantagenet era the city derived considerable benefit from the concourse of pilgrims to the shrine of Thomas a Becket. Charles I. was married here to Henrietta Marie ; and Charles IL, after his restoration, held court here for three days. Cfmtertmry gives the title Vis count to the Manners Sutton family, the first Viscount having been created a Peer in 1834, after holding the office of Speaker of the House of Commons from 1817 to 1834. Among the eminent men who have flourished here, may be noticed \u2014 the Primate Stephen Langton, who first divided the Old and New Testa ments into chapters ; Osbern, a monk in the eleventh century, who wrote in Latin the life of St. Dunstan, and who, from his skill in music, was called the English Jubal ; John Bale, Prebendary of Can terbury, and Bishop of Ossory, the Protestant historian biographer ; Isaac Casaubon, whom, on account of his learn ing, James I. invited over from France, and Meric, his son, who were both in stalled prebendaries. Among the eminent men who received the rudiments of their (STATION). \u2014A metropolitan station on the eastern section of the main line. It is within the parish of Camberwell aud parliamentary borough of Lambeth. Camberwell manor is mentioned in Domesday Book, and was given by Henry I. to his son Robert. The area of the parish is 4,450 acres. Population .- 111,300. The station is the nearest point for Camberwell Road and Camberwell New Road. Trains run each way every ten minutes. CANTERBURY (STATION).\u2014 A parliamentary (returning two mem- bers) and municipal borough in the eastern division of the county of Kent ; the metropolitan see of all England, capi- tal of the county, a city and county in .itself, market town and poor law union of fourteen parishes, in the hundreds of Bridge and Petham, deanery, arch- deaconry and diocese of Canterbury ; a principal station on the main line, Lon- don Chatham and Dover Railway, and also on the Ashford and Margate branch of the South Eastern Railway ; 55 miles from London by road and 62 by railway,"], [70, "A2 to St. Peter and St. Paul, which title Dunstan changed to that of St. Augus tine. Tbe abbey became a place of great magnificence, being endowed with 12,000 acres of land. Henry VIII. converted it into a palace for himself. Philip and Mary granted it to Cardinal Pole ; and Elizabeth kept court here. Its beauti ful gateway still remains. Soon after the conversion of Ethelbert, this city was made a bishopric, and Augustine the education in the King's free grammar school may be noticed \u2014 Dr. Harvey, who discovered the circulation of the Mood ; Dr. Marsh, Bishop of Peterborough ; and Lord Tenterden. Among the names of ac tual natives of the city we may enumerate those of \u2014 Dr.Thomas Linacre, founder of the Royal College of Physicians in Lon don; Dr. Thomas Neville, Master of Magdalene College, and afterwards Mas ter of Trinity College, Cambridge, who THE REMAINS OF CANTERBURY CASTLE. was sent by Archbishop Whitgift to tender the English crown to King James ; Boyle, the great Earl of Cork ; WiUiam Somner, author of the ' Anti quities of Canterbury ' and of a Saxon Glossary ; and W. Frend, MM. A., author of the ' Ephemeris.' Canterbury has been the cradle of Saxon and Mo dern English Christianity. Ethelbert's palace was converted into a church and monastery, and an abbey built, dedicated first bishop. Many Roman relics have been discovered in Canterbury. The castle appears to have fallen to decay at a very early date, as no mention is made of it in connection therewith ; but another castle was built, the donjon of which still exists, which is mentioned in Domesday Book. The city abounds with remains of old architecture, amongst which are\u2014 the house of Sir Thomas More, the Old Chequers Inn where the"], [71, "33 pilgrims lodged, some old gabled houses with overhanging stories, and many ruins of ecclesiastical edifices. The distin- guishing feature of Canterbury is the magnificent cathedral commenced by Lafranc, and added to by subsequent prelates. It is cruciform in shape, 530 feet in length, with a central and two western towers, a beautiful chapter-- house and some splendid chapels, of which the finest are those of Henry IV., the Lady chapel, and that of the Holy Trinity, in which stood the shrine of a Becket. The crypt has been used since the time of Elizabeth as a French Protestant church. The library con- tains some rare MSS., and in the pre- cincts are the residential bouses of the clergy. The archbishops had, at one time, a palace here, but it became dilapi- dated, and has been superseded by Lam- beth Palace. Besides the cathedral, there are fourteen parish churches,someof them very ancient, and chapels for several dissenting sects. Other public buildings are \u2014 the guildhall, the court house, the county hall, the house of correction, the barracks, the military infirmary, the Kent and Canterbury hospital, the dis- pensary, the market house, the corn and hop exchange, the theatre, the assembly rooms, St. Augustine's college, the philo- sophical institute aud museum, the free library, &c. Canterbury formerly abounded with monasteries aud nuuneries, for monks and nuns of every order, chantries, hospitals, almshouses, and other religious and charitable institu- tions, founded by the piety of our fore- fathers. Amongst those which have sur- vived to the present time are \u2014 the hospital of St. John, founded by Lafranc in 1086, and now supporting a prior and eighteen brethren, who are appointed by the archbishop ; Cogan's hospital for clergymen's widows, founded in 1199; King's Bridge hospital, established by Thomas a Becket for educational pur- poses and for the maintenance of poor persons ; Maynard's aud Cotton's hos- pitals; Smith's and Hern's almshouses, &c. ; all of which institutions are under the management of trustees appointed by the Lord Chancellor. There is a free grammar school, founded by Henry VIII., and endowed with twenty-four scholarships. Also blue-coat school for educating sixteen poor boys belonging to the city, the elections to which are made by the council. The revenue of this school is derived from lands, <fcc, in the city and in Kent, formerly belonging to the hospital of poor priests ; the surplus funds are appropriated to the reduction of the poor rates. St. Augustine's mis- sionary college, founded by Mr. Beres- ford Hope, -is situated on the site of the old abbey In which the saint was buried, and of which the north gate still remains. Under the Romans, the government of Canterbury was similar to that of other Roman towns ; under the Saxons, the chief magistrate was called the prefect and afterwards the ' port-gerefa,' or keeper of the walls ; this title was after- wards changed into that of king's pro- vost, when the king and archbishop held some sort of joint jurisdiction, aud although the latter had the power of coining, he was, nevertheless, subordinate to the king. But it would seem that there was a municipal government also, since Edward the Confessor had fifty-one burgesses or freemen, who paid a rent for the privilege of trading in the city. At the time of the Conquest, the chief government was in the hands of the ' pr\u00e6positiis,' or prefect, appointed by the king From Henry II. the city re- ceived a charter conferring peculiar pri- vileges, in addition to those previously enjoyed. Henry III. granted the city to the inhabitants at fee-farm rent of \u00a360, and empowered the citizens to elect two bailiffs, superseded by a mayor in the reign of Henry VI. (1449), who con- ferred the privilege of choosing a coroner. Edward IV. confirmed the preceding charters, remitted more than one-fourth of the fee-farm rent, and constituted the city a county in itself. Henry Vl.fixedthe number of aldermen at twelve, and of tbe common - councdmen at twenty - four. Henry VIII., by Act of Parliament, in 1544, empowered the mayor and alder men to levy a fine of 6s. 8d. per day upon all strangers who should keep shops or exercise any trade in the city. James I. confirmed all the former charters and privileges and re-incorporated the citi- zens, under the title of the mayor and. commonality of the city of Canterbury. The freedom of the city is inherited by birth, or acquired by servitude, gift, mar riage with a freeman's daughter, or by purchase. Charles II., in 1 676, granted. 5"], [72, "34 the county. The corporation is the urban sanitary authority. Works of main drainage were executed under the superseded pavement commissioners, and a charter of incorporation to the refugee silk weavers established here. As con- stituted under the Municipal Act, the city is divided into three wards, with a CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL (SOUTH-EAST YIEW), mayor, recorder, sheriff, six aldermen, and eighteen councillors, and it has it3 town commission of the peace, quarter sessions, and police force distinct from sewage works are in operation. The gasworks and waterworks are vested in a private company. The corpora tion lately obtained a General Im-"], [73, "35 provement Act, which empowered them, among other things, to establish a burial board and cemetery. In ancient times the city had a reputation for silk manufactures, but they have given place to a superior kind of damask linen. Worsted is also made here, and there are several large malting and brewing estab- lishments. The district is, however chiefly agricultural. Area: 3,7 74 acres.

The church is ancient. CHATHAM (STATION).\u2014 A par- liamentary (returning one member) borough, urban sanitary district, town and palish in the county of Kent (mid division), Medway union, and Rochester county court district and petty sessional division ; Chatham, however, forms a special police district, and, in conjunction with Sheerness, engages a stipendiary magistrate. The town is on the south bank of the Medway and adjoins both Rochester and Strood. Its royal dock- yard and repository for naval stores and ordnance are protected by a system of for- tifications \u2014 the ' Chatham lines ' \u2014 un- equalled in the world ; in fact, both shores of the river, from the Nore to the harbour, and the land approaches in every direc- tion, display a seemingly interminable series of batteries and forts. Chat- ham seems to have been a place of little importance prior to the establishment of the dockyard. The town was originally built by Charles the Second, after the Dutch war. It consists chiefly of one long, bustling street, with smaller ones branching out of it eastward, in con- tinuation of Rochester, on the road to Canterbury. The naval station was formed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Chatham old Church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was almost entirely rebuilt in 1788. The shrine of Our Lady at Chatham used to be famous for working miracles. In the church is the tomb of Stephen Borough, who discovered the passage to Archangel. St. John's was erected in 1821, by the Parliamentary Commissioners, at a cost of fifteen thou- sand pounds. St. Bartholomew's Chapel stands on the site of an ancient hospital for lepers. Behind the \" Sun Inn,\" is a pier erected by Colonel Best at a cost of three thousand pounds. On account of the fortifications in the neighbourhood, a military school was founded here in 1812. In the course of the practice in each year, siege operations are sometimes carried on upon a large scale, and attract many strangers. A large invalid esta- blishment is kept up at Chatham. Mel- ville Hospital contains 134 patients. The hospital for decayed mariners was founded by Sir John Hawkins in 1592, and provides for twelve pensioners. An old house in the High Street, let out in tenements and decorated with carvings, was once the residence of the celebrated CHARTHAM. \u2014 (Station\u2014CAN TERBURY\u20142 miles.)\u2014 A village and parish in the county of Kent (eastern division), Bridge union, and Canterbury county court district and petty sessional division. It is pleasantly situated on the River Stour. The population is largely composed of the workmen em ployed at Mr. W. Howard's paper mills, and their families. There are several monuments of early date in the church, which is in the decorated style. The East Kent lunatic asylum \u2014 erected in 1875 at a cost of \u00a3200,000\u2014 is at Chart ham Downs, which have at various times yielded Anglo-Saxon relics. Area ; 5,530 acres.

CHISLEHURST. \u2014 (Station \u2014 BICKLEY\u2014 2 miles.)\u2014 A village aDd parish of the county of Kent (western division) ; in Bromley union, county court district, and petty sessional divi sion. The South Eastern have a station here, the main line route of that Com pany passing through the parish. The neighbourhood abounds in beautiful scenery, and boasts some splendid man sions and picturesque parks. Camden Place, the residence of the ex-Empress Eugenie \u2014 close to which is St. Mary's Catholic Church, containing the tombs of Napoleon III. and his ill-fated son \u2014 takes its name from Camden, the cele brated historian and antiquarian. Frog nal is the seat of the Lord Lieutenant of the county of Kent, Earl Sydney. Scad bury Park is a well-timbered and attrac tive estate. Chislehurst possesses three churches, in addition to chapels for Non conformists. St. Nicholas is the parish church, and is an interesting building, dating from about the year 1450, but some parts of it are alleged to be of even earlier date. It comprises the tomb house of the Sydney family. The other two churches (Christ Church and Church of the Annunciation) have been erected since 1870. Area : 2,742 acres. Popula tion: 3,313. CLAPHAM. \u2014 (CLAPHAM and CLAPHAM JUNCTION).\u2014 An exten sive suburb of the south-western division of the metropolis, and in the eastern divi sion of the county of Surrey. It forms part of the Wandsworth poor-law and county court districts, and is within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Board of Works, Metropolitan Police, and Central Criminal Court. The Junction station is actually in Battersea parish. Clapham Common is now one of the open spaces under the control of the thipbuilders, the Petts, who may be con sidered as having modelled the English navy in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Lepers' Hospital, founded in 1108, and under the patronage of the dean, is now an almshouse, with four inmates, two of whom- are officiating chaplains. At Chatham is the Medway Union Workhouse, which comprises seven parishes. The Literary Institution possesses a good library. The Convict frison accommodates 1,000 inmates. The arsenal and barracks extend more than two miles along the Medway. The former contains storehouses and a large park of artillery. The Marine Hospital has accommodation for 340 patients. The Artillery Barrack is a great station for artillery, lt was erected in 1804, and forms three side3 of a square, and has accommodation for a large number of invalids. The Artillery Hospital is attached to the barrack. The Infantry Barracks are very large. There are also Engineering Barracks. The Jubilee Memorial in Chatham was erected in 1859. The hospital dedicated to St. Bartholomew contains one hundred beds. In 1801 was completed the Royal Engineers' Memorial, the first stone hav ing been laid by the Duke of Cambridge on March 1st, 1860. The names of every officer and every sapper alike who fell in the Crimea are inscribed on white marble slabs let into the stonework of the arch ; so that the memorial is truly, as its inscription implies, a memorial by \" The Corps of Royal Engineers to their Comradeswho fell in the war withRussia, 1854, 1855, and 1856.\" The Dockyard at Chatham was founded in Queen Elizabeth's time on a small scale. This establishment was where the Ordnance Wharf or Old Dock now stands. In 1667, the Dutch admiral, Van Ghent, burnt several ships here ; and from that time it was strongly fortified and extended, and is now one of the four grand naval stations of the empire, ranking with Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Woolwich. Sheerness is connected with it. The Dockyard is nearly a mile in length, extending down the river. The public are admitted under certain regulations daily, except Sundays. The yard contains wet docks, magazines, storehouses, a church, and residences for the naval officers. A large establishment of arti-"], [75, "77 Metropolitan Board of Works ; it com prises about 200 acres of land, which formerly were little better than a swamp.

The station, although styled Sole Street from its con tiguity to the ancient high road of that name, is within the parish of"], [76, "38 effigy of Sir Reginald Braybrooke, her second husband ; on her right is Sir Nicholas Hawberke, her third spouse : these two latter brasses are, perhaps, the most elegantly engraved of the whole series. The two exterior monuments of the upper row, the figures in which are less than life-size, are those to John and Thomas Brooke, Barons of Cobhaui, their wives aud families. Against the chancel walls are hung some rust-eaten pieces of armour, apparently remains of tilt-armour of the reign of Henry the Fifth. A helmet, surmounted with a representation of a human head, belonged, according to village tradition, to one of the lords of Cobham, who settled a pending dispute with some neighbouring noble in a trial by battle. His lady is at his side, and several children are around them in a kneeling position. The ancient College was founded by John, Lord Cobham, whose monumeut we have mentioned. Lambarde, the Kentish perambulator, was one of its first trustees. The quaint old dining hall is now a chapel, for the use of the pensioners who reside here. The build ing was founded for the support of tive priests. At the Dissolution it was re sounded, and the funds were employed in providing a residence for twenty poor persons, with a quarter of an acre of land to each, and a small monthly stipend. It is an easy walk hence to the Hall, which is seen, reposing beneath the shel ter of a thickly and well-planted range of stately trees. In a brick gateway near the stabling a curious carved carriage is shown, said to be the vehicle in which Mary, Queen of Scots, rouo after her marriage with the Earl of Darnley. Another ac count connects it with the time of Charles the Second. A door on the left hand of a Tudor archway discloses the exterior of this stately old English mansion, which is entirely domestic in character ; the main building \u2014 of brick \u2014 consisting of two extensive wings with lofty octagonal tur rets in the middle and at the extremities. These wings are inscribed with their respective dates of erection, being 1682 and 1594. They are united by a central building, designed by Inigo Jones ; tlie ground plan of the edifice being thus in the form of a capital H. As a whole, it is both striking and picturesque. Tbe rooms which are shown at Cobham have Cobham. The villsge of Cobham itself, is a quiet, unpretending place. The church, dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen, at the entrance to the village, discloses by a survey of the architectural features of its exterior the great age of the main portions of the fabric ; and this is corro borated by the inscription among the most ancient of the brass effigies to be seen within, bearing date 1354, being upwards of five centuries old ; the church itself may claim one hundred years in advance of this. The general appearance of the interior, like that of most village churches, presents a curious sample of modern whitewash renovation, contrasted with the remains of an ancient decorative character. The rich oak screens and carved stalls, crumbling now into the very dust of age, accord but doubtfully with the coloured roof and painted pews. The magnificent series of brasses, thirteen in number, memorials of the Cobhams and Brookes, are the first objects to be observed ; for these, above all else, have made this little church celebrated far aiirf wide. These brass effigies, all, with two exceptions, of the size of life, are mostly in a good state of preservation. Commencing at the south-east corner, the first of the lower range is that of Sir John de Cobham, known as \" the young Constable,\" from having held, early in life, the government of the neighbouring castle of Rochester. The next effigy is Margerie, said to be wife to Reynold de Cobham, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in the reign of Edward the Third. The third figure is Maud, wife of Sir Henry de Cobham, son of the preceding Beside Maud is placed the figure of Margaret, wife of John, Lord Cobham, whose memorial succeeds next. This nobleman built a bridge at Ro chester, converted the family mansion at Cowling into a fortified castle, and founded the original College adjoining the churchyard. He was one of the council of Regency during the youth of Richard the Second. Thomas, whose memorial ranges next, was uncle of the preceding. Joan, daughter of Lord Cobham, succeeds. She died during the lifetime of her father, leaving her daughter, Joan, who had five successive husbands, the fourth among them being the venerable martyr, Sir John Old castle. Placed on her left hand is the"], [77, "39 little of the air of antiquity. In the early part of the present century the whole house underwent changes deteriorating to its original character, but, doubtless, more adapted to modern convenience. Many of the rooms are very elegant, and they are furnished with considerable splendour. The dining room is chastely decorated, by which the effect of the pictures is considerably enhanced. The next, the music-room, is the most mag nificent in the house, and is said to have been pronounced by George the Fourth \" the finest room in England.\" This is one of the apartments erected by Inigo Jones. It is large, lofty, and well proportioned; the walls are, to some height, of polished white marble, with pilasters of Sienna marble. The floor is of polished oak -, at one end of the room is a music gallery, containing an organ, ln the music-hall there is a very fine full-length picture, by Vandyke, of the two sons of the Earl of Lennox, who were killed while fighting for Charles the First against the Parliament. In the dining-room are several other por traits by Vandyke. There are also in this room portraits by Lely and Kneller. On the staircase are several large paint ings, but the chief and most valuable are collected in the Picture Gallery. Here is Rubens' grand picture, \" The Head of Cyrus brought to Queen To myris.\" This picture was purchased from the Orleans collection. There is also an other good painting by Rubens, \" The Boar Hunt,\"very animated and vigorous. The (iuidos, of which there are seve ral, are generally considered among the choicest pictures in the gallery. There are also two or three paintings by Titian, also two historical subjects by Salvator Rosa, much admired. In this gallery is a large antique bath of the finest red oriental granite, which the Italians call coralliuo. The most valu able paintings belong to the Venetian and the Neerlandish schools ; but there are many interesting specimens of the Neapolitan and Bolognese, French, and English schools ; nor are the Spanish and German quite unre presented. The chief part cf the col lection was formed by the purchase of a number of pictures from the Orleans Gallery, and also by that of the Vetturi Gallery from Venice. The park, which is well stocked with deer, extends over an area of nearly two thousand acres, and is seven miles in circumference. It is well diversified with hill and valley, and broad smooth glades and bosky dells. Some parts of it afford the most beautiful woody scenery that can be desired ; others present wide and noble prospects. The park contains some very large trees, the chestnuts being especially famous. One is known as the \" Four Sisters,\" from the four large arms into which its stem, thirty-two feet in circum ference, divides itself. The railway tra verses a considerable portion of the estate. Area : 3,056 acres. Population, 998. COLDRED.\u2014 (Station \u2014 SHEP HERD'S WELL\u2014 1| miles.)\u2014 A parish and small village of the county of Kent (mid division) ; in Dover union, county court district, and petty sessional divi sion. The parish church is a very old building, and surrounded by an earth work of considerable extent, whicli tradi tion relates to have been thrown up as a means of defence by the Kentish men, who obtained the assistance of Ceoldred, King of Mercia, against the West Saxons, in 715. The name of the place in Domesday Book is Colret. The Romans are believed to have had a settlement here. Area : 1,533 acres. Population : 140.

Population : 221."], [78, "40 also- take place at the parish church in Upper Deal, and at St. George's iu Lower Deal. The borough consists of Upper and Lower Deal, Walmer, Sholden, and Great and Little Mongeham. The parish church of St. Mary is small but ancient, in the Norman style, with zigzag mould ings, and is surrounded by a fosse. A chapel of ease, dedicated to the Saviour, was built in 1848. Other churches are\u2014 St. George's, St. Andrew's (recently altered and repaired), St. Leonard's, and St. Martin's at Great Mongeham. The Catholics, Wesleyan Methodists, Inde pendents, Primitive Methodists, and Unitarians also have chapels in the town. In 1864 a handsome iron pier was erected, which forms a good promenade in summer for visitors. At Walmer there is a large naval and military hospital, and barracks for soldiers. On the shore is an electric time-ball for the use of ships in the Downs. The air being good, and the sea-beach favourable for bathing, Deal has of late years been resorted to as a watering-place, and several smart-looking villas and rows of houses have been erected for the accom modation of visitors, besides bath**, libraries, bazaars, &c. There are also national and infant schools, custom house, dispensary, infirmary, and old and new assembly rooms. There - little or no trade, tho population bein6 chiefly employed as boatmen, pilots, and fishermen. Boat-building exists on a small scale, and passing ships are supplied with stores. The intrepidity of the Deal boatmen in putting to sea in the roughest weather, for the purpose of saving lives and relieving distressed vessels, is familiar to all.

DENMARK HILL (STATION). DEAL (STATION). \u2014 A municipal borough of East Kent (included in the parliamentary representation of Sand wich),market town, parish, seaport, pilot and coastguard station, member of the Cinque Port of Sandwich ; in the hun dreds of Cornils and Bewsborough, lathe of St. Augustine, deanery of Sandwich, archdeariery and diocese of Canterbury, the terminal station of a branch line from Ramsgate on the South Eastern Railway (from which a recent extension \u2014 jointly undertaken by the London Chatham and Dover and South Eastern Railways \u2014 communicates with Walmer and Dover) ; 89 miles from London by rail and 73 by road, 21 from Canterbury, 9 from Dover, and 13 from Ramsgate. By the ancient Britons it was called \" Dole,\" signifying a low open plain upon the sea , and many adhere to the belief, based upon the authority of Henricus, that it is the place where C\u00e6sar landed. It was annexed to the Cinque Ports soon after the Conquest. Henry VIII. erected three castles in ils vicinity \u2014 those of Deal, Walmer and Sandown \u2014 for the \u25a0defence of the coast ; and besides these, there are two batteries ; making five fortresses within four miles. Walmer Castle is the official residence of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and in it the Duke of Wellington died in 1852. Deal Castle has been converted into a family residence, the moat having been planted with trees, and changed into a promenade ; and Sandown, where Colonel HutchiDson was imprisoned and died in 1664, is now in ruins. For parliamentary purposes Walmer was united to Deal by the Reform Act, which places, in conjunction with Sand wich, return two members to the House of Commons. Deal was made a free borough, by charter, in 1699, by William III., with a mayor, twelve jurats, and a council of twenty-four ; the jurats acting as magistrates, separate from the county justices. The corporation now consists of a mayor, six aldermen, and eighteen councillors, aud the borough has a com mission of the peace, with quarter sessions and its own police force. The corporation is the urban sanitary authority. Water and gas works are in the hands of joint stock companies.

DOVER.\u2014 (Stations\u2014 PRIORY, for the North end of town, TOWN AND HARBOUR, and the ADMIRALTY PIER*.) \u2014 A parliamentary and municipal borough of the county of Kent (eastern division), market town, and poor-law union of twenty-three parishes, seaport and 3team-packet station, one of the Cinque Ports, in the hundred of Bews borough, lathe of St. Augustine, deanery of Dover, and archdeaconry and diocese of Canterbury ; a terminal station of the London Chatham and Dover and the South Eastern railways ; 78 miles from London by the former, and 76 by the latter line ; 16 miles from Canterbury. \u2014 On account of its position as the nearest landing place from the Continent, Dover has from the earliest period been a place of some importance. It was the place at whicli Julius Caesar intended to laud his forces when he invaded England, but the heights appeared to him so formidably defended by the Britons, that he was obliged to go further north. It was called \" Dwyr \" (from \" Dwyffyrrha,\" a steep place) by the ancient Britons, \" Dubris \" by the Romans, \" Dofre \" or \"Dovre\" bythe Saxons, and in Domesday Book appears under the name of \"Do vere.\" As the principal of the Cinque Ports it figures conspictiouslyin history \u2014 William the Conqueror was the first who gave to the Cinque Ports an independent jurisdiction; by him they were created into a sort of palatinate, with a lord warden, invested with civil, military, and naval authority, and having his seat of administration at the Castle of Dover. Each of the five ports had its own corporation of twelve jurats, from whom the mayor and bailiff were choseu. Tho Parliamentary Reform Act of 1832 and the Municipal Act of 1835 broke up to a great extent the peculiar political and municipal organization of the Cinque Ports, and assimilated their local govern ment to that of other towns. Dover has a separate commission of the peace, quarter sessions, and police force. The corporation act as the urban sanitary authority, and they have established waterworks under the Local Government Act of 1858 ; the gasworks are in the hauds of a joint-stock company. The castle occupies an area of thirty-five acres, on the summit of a cliff. The modern fortifications connected with the castle are very extensive. The opposite heights, known a3 \" the Citadel,\" are also fortified. The first works of im portance in connection with the harbour were those commenced by Henry VIII., and continued by Elizabeth and James I. \u2014 in the year 1844, great improvements were commenced, the entrance was deep ened, the pier repaired, and the outer harboui enlarged to the extent of 7J acres. In 1847 a new set of works was undertaken for the formation of a harbour of refuge, intended to enclose no less than 520 acres; the Admiralty pier, which forms its west arm, was commenced in 1848, and has been thrown out to nearly half a mile from the shore. This portion underwent great damage by a storm on New Year's day, 1877 ; it is estimated that these gigantic works will have cost, when completed, some where about \u00a32,500,000 sterling. The other public national buildings are \u2014 the custom house, the excise office, the alien office, the royal engineers' department, the military hospital, the pilots' office, the brigade office, &c. The towu hall was once part of the \" Maison Dieu \" (a hospital founded by Hubert de Burgh), and was purchased from the Government by the corporation, who converted the nave of the old church into the town hall, the Lady Chapel into the sessions hall, the vaults into dungeons, and the tower into a residence for the governor. In 1849 the corporation erected the museum and philosophical institution ; besides which Dover contains a theatre, the Wellington hall and assembly rooms, the Apollonion hall, the working men's institute, the proprietary library, the philosophical institution, the youths' institute, -fee, and a monument erected to the memory of the officers and men of the 60th Rifles who fell in the Indian war.

The place is famous for its College, constituted under the title of \" Alleyn's College of God's Gift at Dulwich.\" The founder was Edward Alleyn, a comedian, who enjoyed the friendship of the illustrious Shakspere, and endowed tbe College with the revenues of the Manor of Dul wich and house property in London. In 1858 an Act of Parliament defined the object of the charity more in accordance with the spirit of the bequest. It is managed by nineteen governors \u2014 part elected by certain metropolitan parishes,"], [81, "43 and part appointed by the Chancery Division of the High Court, with the Archbishop of Canterbury as visitor. The revenues of tho College at the present time are about \u00a320,000 per annum. The College was rebuilt in 1869-70, and on the 21st of June, 1871, it was opened by the Prince of Wales. The buildings are in the Northern Italian style of the 13th century : they consist of three groups, connected by covered cloisters, and comprise a great hall, library, lecture theatre, laboratories, and class rooms for about 600 boys, to gether with kitchens and offices, and two official residences. The chapel of the college still remains on the old site. The Lower School is established for the benefit exclusively of the children of residents in the parishes which elect governors ; day boys must be above eight years of age, and able to read and write at the time of admission ; no boy can remain at the school after the age of sixteen ; the subjects taught are, with the exception of Greek, the same as in the Upper School ; but the in struction in these subjects is more elementary in character, and is intended to \" bear especially on their application to the industrial arts.\" Foundation scholars are elected by the governors, after an examination, and must be be tween the ages of eight and twelve years at the time of election, and poor orphans, having lost one or both parents, or, in default of such orphans, then the chil dren of parents resident inthe privileged parishes. Apprentice gifts and scholar ships are also awarded at the annual examination to deserving scholars. In the Upper School instruction is given, under the requirements of the Act of Parliament, in English, French, Greek, and Latin, in arithmetic and mathematics, in drawing and practical geometry, writ ing and vocal music. Boys are admitted between the ages of eight and fifteen, and may remain till thc age of eighteen years : in the admission of day boys a pre ference is reserved for the sons of residents in the parishes above named. Exhibitions are granted to deserving scholars proceeding to one of the Eng lish universities, or becoming bond fiiie students of some learned or scientific profession, or of the fine arts, with a view to the professional practice thereof. In the eleemosynary branch the resident recipients of the charity consist of 12 men and 12 women, the former called \" brethren \" and the latter \" sisters \" of Dulwich College, selected from among respectable persons, either married or single, who have fallen from better cir cumstances into indigence, and must be residents in one or other of the four parishes above named, and of the age of 60 years or upwards. They are elected by the governors, in each case, from a. list of three candidates nominated by the vestry of the parish to which the existing vacancy appertains, provided with residences in the college, and a weekly stipend of \u00a31. There are also 12 \" out-pensioners \" receiving 10s. a week each. In the appointment of alms people from the parish of Camberwell (as well as in the admission of boys to either school), a preference is given to residents in the hamlet of Dulwich. The picture gallery of the college enjoys a very high reputation, and contains some fine specimens of the old masters. It was bequeathed to the college by the late Sir Francis Bourgeois, in 1811, with \u00a311,000 to build a gallery for its recep tion, and to provide for the proper care of the pictures. The public are admitted gratuitously daily from 10 to 5 in summer, and from 10 to 4 in winter. The Dulwich Girls' School, founded by James Allen, one of the masters of the college (1741), is, by the powers of the same Act of Parliament as that relating to the college, under the management of the chairman of the governors, the master, and the chaplain.

William the Conqueror granted the manor to one of his followers, and in the reign of Stephen it was bestowed upon William d'Ypre, Earl of Kent. King Stephen built an abbey here, within whose walls he, his queen Matilda, and his son Eustace were buried.

KENT, County of. \u2014Kent is a maritime county, bounded on the north by the Thames and German Ocean, east and south-east by the latter and the Straits of Dover, south by Sussex, and west by Surrey, and having on its east and south coasts the North and South Forelands and Dungeness. Length, 67 miles; breadth, 35 miles; circumference, 190 miles ; square miles, 1,627. Watered by the Stour, Medway, Darent and other rivers. The Medway is the noblest feeder of the Thames, and lias a total length of sixty miles, forty of which are navigable. Lime-burning is carried on upon the Lower Medway ; on the upper streams, the paper trade, parish church\u2014 restored some years ago \u2014 is a most venerable structure, and contains fragments of a Roman pave ment. The \" Home for Little Boys\" is in this parish. Tho buildings \u2014 erected gradually from the year 1866 \u2014 accom modate several hundred orphan lads, who must be under ten years of age at the time of their admission, and whose circumstances and station in life dis qualify them from being received into orphan asylums. They are maintained until they arc fourteen years of age, and taught a variety of trades, <fec. The institution is supported mainly by volun tary contributions, and is one which has commended itself to general sympathy from the date of its formation. Area: 2,832 acres. Population : 1,382.

Borough Green, which shares the name of the station with Wrotham, is partly within the limits of the parish of Ight- ham. Area: 2,604 acres. Population: 1,150. ISLE OF GRAIN\u2014 (Station\u2014 SHEERNESS\u2014 1 J mile.)\u2014 A parish and district of the county of Kent (mid division), at the junction of the river Medway and Thames, one portion facing Sheerness \u2014 forming the west bank of the first-named channel, and another portion, the south bank of the last-named waterway. The marshes and a wide creek once rendered the parish a perfect island, but it is now connected by road with Rochester, some twelve miles distant, which place only affords Land communication with the parish. From Sheerness station, the Medway has to be crossed by boat, which in rough weather is an unpleasant journey. The north-east corner of the island is strongly fortified, the earth works enclosing barracks for 300"], [87, "49 to whieh it is navigated by steam. Ships and large vessels get up to Rochester bridge. The Dour River is a very trifling stream, but it received its present name from the Britons, signify ing \" water,\" and was known also to the Romans as the Durius. It gives name to Dover, in the valley of which it anciently formed the haven, now built upon and carried out seaward. The river Rother rises in Sussex ; it is navigable on its entry into Kent, and was anciently called by the Britons and Romans the Limene, entering the sea at New Romney. In the time of Ed ward I. it deserted its channel, and tformed a new one by Rye and Winchel sea. The principal canal is the Royal Military Canal,running along tho borders of Romney Marsh from the Rother to Hythe, very little above the level of the sea. The Gravesend and Rochester Canal has been partly used for the North Kent Railway, but its basins and the portions fiom Gravesend to Higham still remain. The county is intersected by nearly 4,400 nniles of roads, and the railway communi cation is effected by the lines belonging to the South Eastern, and London Chatham and Dover Railway Companies. \u2022Ou that part of the coast bounding the \u2022estuary of the Thames, there are num \u2022erous examples both of the gain and loss of land by the sea. Off the east shore lie the well-known Goodwin Sands, between which and the mainland is the equally well-known roadstead called the Downs. Kent may be designated a hilly country, being divided by two nearly parallel chains of chalk hills, which traverse the county west to east, terminating in lofty chalk cliffs at Dover, Folkestone and Hythe. The \u25a0climate of Kent is in general mild and genial. The soil may be divided into the gravel, chalk and clay, which pro duce, where they mix in due proportion, an extremely fertile loam. The alluvial soils along the Thames and Medway, and in Romney Marsh, produce some of the richest pastures in the kingdom. The gardening of the county was much improved by the Netherland refugees in the sixteenth century. The woods in Kent are extensive, and produce much oak, beech, hop-poles, billet-wood, hoops \u2022rnd bark, besides timber for ships and house- building. The lathe of Sutton-at- Ilone is a great fruit district, and tl.e valley of the Medway is famous for hops, aud the hopping season is as joyous here as the vintage is elsewhere. Building stone is quarried in the chalk. and the ragstone of the Weald. Faver sham, Milton and Whitstable are celebrated for their oysters. The county returns two members for the east division, two for the mid, and two for the west. It is in the South-eastern circuit, the assizes being held at Maid stone, and it constitutes the archdeacon ries of Canterbury and Rochester, in those dioceses, province of Canterbury. The borough representation comprises Canterbury (city), Dover, Greenwich (metropolitan borough), Maidstone, Rochester (city), and Sandwich, two members each, Chatham, Gravesend, and Hythe, one member each. The shire has 5 lathes and 61 hundreds, and comprises the barony of Bircholt, the lowery of Tunbridge, the liberty of the Isle of Sheppey, the liberty of New Romney, 437 civil parishes, besides parts of others, 25 poor-law unions (exclusive of the Metropolis), 1 poor-law district under a special Act (Canterbury), 3 poor-law unions within the Metropoli tan district (Greenwich, Lewisham and Woolwich), 29 registry districts, 12 municipal boroughs [Canterbury (city and county of itself), Deal, Dover, Faversham, Folkestone, Gravesend, Hythe, Maidstone, Margate, Rochester (city), Sandwich, and Tenterden], 34 urban sanitary authorities, 25 rural sanitary authorities, and 22 turnpike trusts. It also has one court of quarter sessions, and is divided into 16 petty sessional divisions and 17 lieutenancy sub-divisions. All the boroughs above named have commissions of the peace and separate courts of quarter sessions, and their own police. The liberty of Romney Marsh has petty and general sessions,and theancient borough of Queen borough has a court of quarter sessions distinct from the county. Dover, Hythe, New Romney, and Sandwich are cinque ports, and Deal, Faversham, Folkestone, and Margate are corporate members o f one or other of them. Fordwich (corporate member of the cinque port of Sandwich), Lydd (corporate member of the cinque port of New Romney), and New Romuey are governed under old charters and not 6"], [88, "50 amenable to the Municipal Corporations Act, l&'io. The Cinque Ports' justices exercise jurisdiction in and for the Deal Division of the liberties of the Cinque Ports (comprising the parishes of Ringwould and Waimer and the hamlet of Kingsdown), and the parish and town of Ramsgate. Tbe towns of Ramsgate and Tunbridge Wells main tain police establishments separate from the county. A considerable portion of the county is included in the metro politan police, Central Criminal Court, Metropolitan Board of Works and London SchoolBoard jurisdictions. Chalk and greensand prevail in tbe hills, and clay mixed with gravel, sand or loam in the more level tracts. Kent is first distinctly noticed by the name of Cantium, doubtless a Latinization of the ancient British appellatior of the same territory. By the Saxons it was called at first Kant-wara-rike, meaning the \" Kentish men's country.\" The present name is an evident derivation of the first words cf the Saxon compound. In the earliest times of English history the \"mon of Kent\" showed themselves true to their origin, and were looked upon as the stay of our naval power. Hence the establishment of the Cinque Ports, endowed with exclusive and valuable privileges, and which, down to the seventeenth century, supplied the greater part of the shipping and seamen to our fleet. It remains at the present time in the possession of the chief of our naval arsenals, and contains many important establishments. Julius C\u00e6sar landed here, and Kent has been the seat of many sanguinary conflicts. William the Conqueror burnt Romney and Dover, but confirmed the men of Kent in their privileges. These are chiefly comprised in gavelkind (from the Saxon Gafel, signifying a rent or acknowledgment in money or in kind, and Gafelkind lands, those for which a rent was paid, or, in other words, lands held by socage tenure, in contradistinction to those which were held by military service), or the suc cession of all the sons, or brothers, and nephews to landed property, and the right of non-forfeiture of lands, except for treason. The year 1170 is memorable for the return of Thomas a Becket from his long exile, and still more so for hi3 muider at Canterbury ; nor is tbe year 1172 less remarkable for the voluntary penance which Henry If. underwent at his tomb. In 1381 the insurrection under Wat Tyler commenced at Dart ford, and the insurgents encamped on Blackheath, whence they proceeded to London. In 1450, also, the rebels under Jack Cade encamped upon Blackheath, and on the same heath, in the February following, a great number of his par tisans craved pardon of the king upon their knees. In 1459 four thousand French troops landed on the coast, and burned the town of Sandwich. The year 1677 is memorable in Kentish annals for the daring attack made by a part of the Dutch fleet on the shipping in the Medway. In December, 1688, the fugi tive King James II. was seized at Sheer ness, and conveyed to Faversham. The Emperor Charles V. landed at Dover from Corunna, May 16, 1520, on a visit to Henry VIII. Charles II. landed at the same place, May 26, 1660, on his return from exile. The manufacturing industries of Kent include the making of bricks, tiles, pottery, cement, and lime, in which several thousand people are engaged, paper, gunpowder (Dartford, Erith, Tunbridge, and Faversham), sugar-moulds, tobacco-pipes, hop- bags, sacks, copperas, sugar refining, tar, whiting, and Tunbridge ware. There are also considerable ship-building and marine-engine yards, iron foundries, breweries, maltings, and tanneries. The chief seats of manufacture are Greenwich, Deptford, Dartford, Maidstone, North fleet, and Faversham. The Cinque Ports figure conspicuously in English history. In the time of the Emperor Diocletian, the Romans placed that part of the British coast nearest the Continent under an officer called the \" Count of the Sea Coast,\" whose duty it was to protect it from invasion. In imitation of this, Edward the Confessor constituted the five ports of Dover, Hastings, Hythe, Romney and Sandwich, a body cor porate, under the government of a portreeve or warden, who also held the office of Constable of Dover Castle, and they afterwards became designated as \" The Cinque Ports ; \" to these were added in early times the ancient towns of WinchUsea and Rye, to which all the privileges of the Cinque Ports were given. They had a peculiar j urisdictidn, separate"], [89, "51 from that of the county, and were obliged to furnish ships and forces in war time, but, in return, were exempted from pecuniary subsidies and had other im munities, one of which was that they could not be sued in any but their own towns ; the warden was also permitted to rank as an admiral. William the Conqueror, however, first gave the Cinque Ports an independent jurisdic tion ; by him they were created into a palatinate, with a lord warden, who was invested with civil and military authority, the chief seat of his adminis tration being Dover Castle. Each of the five ports had its own corporation of twelve jurats, from whom the mayor and bailiff were chosen. Formerly there were several courts exercising a general jurisdiction over the ports, and their members, extending from Birchington, near Margate, to Seaford, in Sussex, that of Shepway being the supreme court. Tho lord warden was the president, the other members being the several mayors and bailiffs, and a certain number of jurats from each town. The Court of Brotherhood and the Court of Guestling were in some respects to be compared with the Imperial Parliament, and it is believed that they were the models on which the latter was originally estab lished. The Court of Lodemanage licensed and regulated the pilots. These courts are now only mere forms, ln the 6th year of his reign, Edward I. gave the oldest charter now on record ; it is 99 years older than the first charter of the City of London. It states that the king had seen the charter granted by bis predecessors, William I. and Edward the Confessor. In tho 18th year of the reign of the same monarch, each of the ports returned two \" barons \" or members to Parliament. , Charles II. gave the Cinque Ports their last charter in the 20th year of his reign. Until the revolution of 1 68S the lord warden exercised the right of nominating one, and sometimes both the members of Parliament for each port ; a special Act abolished this pri vilege in 1689. The Parliamentary Reform Act of 1832 and the Municipal Act of 1835 broke up to a great extent the peculiar political and municipal organization of the Cinque Ports, and their local government has been assimi lated to other towns. By the 1st sec. of 51 Geo. III., cap. 36, the magistrates of the Cinque Ports (who are appointed by the Lord Warden) are empowered to act in such of tbe liberties of the Cinque Ports as have not separate commissions of the peace. They now exercise their functions in Ringwould, Walmer, and Ramsgate.

Tho London Chatham and Dover Company's station here ri a terminal one, its distance from London being 39 miles. Thetownis43 miles from London by the Strood and Maidstone branch of the North Kent Railway, with a continuation of that line joining it to the Paddock Wood station of the South Eastern Railway. It has two stations in connection with the South Eastern sys tem and has also water commu nication with other places by means of the Medway. The quarter sessions for the western division of the county are held here. Maidstone possesses con siderable antiquity, haung been a town prior to the arrival of the Romans, and ranking third in importance amongst th<5 cities of ancient Britain, under the name of Caer Medway. By the Romans it was called Vagniac\u00e6, and afterwards Madus, and was one of their principal stations in this part of the country. Under the Saxons it went by the name of Med wegston, and in the Domesday Book appears as Maddeston, since then cor rupted into its modern name. During the Norman and Plantagenet eras it was one of the possessions of the see of Canterbury, and remained so until 1 he reign of Henry VIII., when it was trans ferred to the crown by Archbishop Cranmer, and was bestowed by Edward VI. on Sir Thomas Wyatt, who held it until his attainder for rebellion, when it again fell to the crown, and was after wards granted to the Romney family. The Archbishops of Canterbury bestowed many favours on the town. Ufford built a palace here in 1348. A college, dedi cated to all Saints, was erected in 1260, rebuilt about 1390, and suppressed in 1538. In 1244 a hospital was built for the benefit of pilgrims passing through the town on their way to the shrine of St. Thomas a Becket at Canterbury ; the chapel of this building still exists, having been restored in 1839 and re-constructed as St. Peter's church. There was also a Franciscan monastery, and a house of the fraternity of Corpus Christi, which were suppressed at the dissolution of monas teries. In Queen Mary's reign Maidstone figures as the place where tbe insurrection, headed by Sir Thomas Wyatt, of Alling ton Castle, lord of the manor, broke out, in opposition to the marriage of the queen with Philip of Spain, ln the par liamentary wars, the burgesses espoused the royal cause, and several Kentish gentlemen posted themselves iu the town to hold it for the king, making every house a fortress. In 1648 Fairfax at tacked it with an army of 10,000 men and with great difficulty succeeded in taking it. Maidstone has sent represen tatives to Parliament since the sixth year of the reign of Edward VI. It wa3, at an early period, governed by a ' portgreve ' (an old Saxon word signifying governor), and twelve brethren. It so continued until Edward VI. , in the year 1549, gave it a charter of incorporation, and changed the title of the chief magistrate to that of 'mayor' ; the corporation being deno minated ' the mayor, jurats, and common alty of Maidstone.' The charter was forfeited in the reign of Queen Mary, as a penalty for the part the townspeople took in the Wyatt insurrection, but was restored, and a new one was granted by Queen Elizabeth, under tlie title of ' the mayor and aldermen of Maidstone.' This charter was renewed and amended by charters from James I. in 1603, 1S19 and 1621, from Chailcs II. in 1082, and"], [92, "54 George II. in 1747, which last was that upon which the rights and privileges of the burgesses were based until the Muni cipal Act of 1835. The borough has its own court of quarter sessions and police force. The corporation act as the urban sanitary authority, and in 1851-2 erected the public baths and washhouses ; they have also constructed main drainage works, at a cost of \u00a330,000. A new bridge has been erected at a cost of \u00a332,000. The waterworks and gasworks are in the hands of private companies. A burial board, appointed by the rate payers, control a cemetery of 25 acres in extent, situate on the Sutton road. The buildings comprise the parish church of All Saints, rebuilt in 1395 by Archbishop Courtenay, and occupying the site of an ancient church dedicated to the Virgin. It still contains twenty-eight carved oak stalls, made for the members of the arch bishop's college. The chuTch of the Holy Trinity was consecrated in 1838. St. Peter's is the restored chapel of the an cient Pilgrims' hospital. St. Paul's, a fine church, of the fourteenth century style, was opened for worship in 1859; St. Philip's in 1858 ; St. Stephen's, in the suburb of Tovil, in 1841, St. John's in 1860, St. Faith's in 1872, and St. Michael and All Angels' in 1876. The Wesley ans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Baptists, Primitive Methodists, Friends, Roman Catholics, and Unitarians have also places of worship. The town hall was erected in the year 1764 ; it is used for magisterial purposes, and is also the nomination and chief polling place for West Kent. The markets were opened in 1825, over which the large corn ex change was erected in 1835, and concert ball in 18C5 ; the exchange has connected with it a farmer's club, an agricultural association, a malt-duty association, a cattle-show club, and a horticultural so- ciety. The national and county buildings . in _\\_ aidstone are \u2014 the barracks, erected in 1797 ; the county gaol, a large building covering thirteen acres of land, erected in 1811-18, at a cost of \u00a3200,000 ; the county lunatic asylum, which cost \u00a350,000, opened in 1833, since greatly enlarged ; and two county hospitals. The grammar school, under the superinten- dence of the corporation, was established by that body in 1547, who purchased of the Crown the buildings of the fraternity of Corpus Christi, at the suppression of monasteries, and converted them into a school for the education of the sons of burgesses. Connected with it are two scholarships of \u00a340 per annum, and chambers for residence, in the University College, Oxford, and four day-boys' scholarships of \u00a310 each. There are also the blue-coat and Sir Charles Booth's schools, besides others connected with the churches and chapels ; a diocesan board of education, a Church of Englaud young men's society, a young men's theological and literary society, a mutual improvement association, St. Paul's literary institute, the religious library, the literary and mechanics' institute, the Chillington house or Charles museum, and the Kent arch\u00e6ological society.

Margate derives its name from its position, having been formerly called ' Mere-gate,' the entrance \"to the sea.. In tho reign of Elizabeth it was au obscure fishing village, after which it employed about twenty small vessels in the coasting and river trade, \u25a0chiefly in the conveyance of grain ; and il was not until the last century when the advantages of sea breezes and sea bathing began to be appreciated, and its level sandy beach, salubrious air, and its proximity to London, pointed it out as a favourable locality for sea-bathing ; when it gradually rose into repute, although until the introduction of steam vessels the voyage thither in the old ' hoys ' was looked upon by the citizens of London as a formidable and perilous undertaking. Notwithstanding the many rivals which have since sprung up, Margate maintains its reputation. Margate was incor porated in 1857, and a court of quarter sessions granted October 23rd, 1869.

It has also one court of quarter sessions, and is divided into 17 petty sessional divisions and 18 lieutenancy sub* divisions, of which the city of London is one distinct from the county. The city of London is a county of itself, governed under tho provisions of its numerous charters, and has distinctive courts of justice, and its own magistracy and police force. Westminster is a chartered and prescriptive city, with a limited exercise of municipal auth ority . Neither city is amenable to the Municipal Corporations Act, 1835, nor are there any boroughs within the county subject to that statute. The liberty of the Tower Hamlets is a separate juris diction, but the powers of its magis trates have been much abridged.

The county lies within the basin of the Thames. The sub stratum is made up entirely of blue clay, or, as it is generally called, the London clay. In some parts the plastic clay attains a thickness of 100 feet to 120 feet. The soil is gravel, and! although not of itself fertile, is so enriched by a profuse application of manure, that it has become equal in fertility to any part of England, and for pasture land, by the improvements mad-* in the drainage, it far exceeds any other part of the kingdom. At the time of C\u00e6sar's invasion, this part of Britain, together with that now forming the county of Essex, was inhabited by the Trinobantes, the first British tribe that submitted to tbe sway of the Romans. On the final reduction of Britain it became a Roman province, and was included in the division called Flavia C\u00e6sariensis. The name is slightly corrupted from the Anglo-Saxon Middle- Seaxe, signifying the county of the Middle Saxons.

Besides which it enjoys a small trade with Holland and the Baltic, and a considerable coasting trade. The marine population, too, are extensively engaged in fishing and going to the aid of vessels in distress on the Goodwin Sands, directly opposite, at a distance of five or six miles. The Slip way was erected in 1838-9. The dimen sions are 480 feet long and 60 feet wide ; and the apparatus is calculated to draw up vessels of from 400 to 500 tons burden ; 400 sail have been received iu this harbour at one time. A military road for the embarkation and debarka tion of troops was completed many years back. Floodgates, of a width to admit vessels of any tonnage, surmounted with elegant iron bridges, divide the inner and outer harbour. A substantial jetty of stone, projecting from the basin-wall into the outer basin, occupies the place of the former oneof wood. A new engine-house and covered workshops for the men, have replaced the sheds in which they formerly carried on their operations ; and the lighthouse has been entirely re erected from its foundation. A lifeboat is kept for use. The pier is, perhaps, tbe finest marine parade in the kingdom. St. George's Church was built in 1827. It is in the Gothic style, with a steeple 137 feet high. The length of the church is 118 feet, and the width about 68 feet, it cost \u00a328,000, and is nearly filled with stained glass. St. Lawrence's Church is a handsome structure in the early Nor man style. A district church, or chapel of-ease to St. Lawrence, erected. 1844 on the East Cliff, is dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Christ Church stands in a pleasant situation at the head of the vale, near the West Cliff, and was consecrated in 1847. It is a handsome erection in the early English style, built of ragstone, with stone quoins and buttresses, and consists of a nave, chancel, side-aisles, with porches on the north and south sides, and a tower surmounted by a lofty spire. All Souls' Church is in Broad Street. St. Augustine's Catholic Church is situated on the West Cliff near the Royal Terrace. It consists of a nave, central tower, a deep chancel, enclosed with richly-carved oak screens, a lady chapel, St. Ethelbert's aisle, and a south transept, part of which is enclosed and forms the founder's chapel, with an altar dedicated to St. Lawrence, the patron of the old parish. All the windows are filled with stained glass. The interior length of the church is 90 feet, and the extreme width of transept 60 feet. The walls are built of flint, and the dressings, as well as the internal walls, of Whitby stone. The style is Early Decorated. There are cloisters and a school attached to the church. The whole was erected from the designs and at the cost of the late A. Welby Pugin, the founder of the church, who resided in Ramsgate ou the West Cliff in the rear of the promenade. Facing the church is the monastery of St. Benedict, which provides accommo dation for 12 monks of that order. The Sailors' Home and Mission Church were built iu 1877, and opened in June, 1878. In the yard at St. Augustine's stands a chantry chapel erected for the family of the late Mr. Digby. It is of the de corated period in style, and displays some Devonshire marble in the shape of small columns. The Nonconformists have several chapels here. There is also a Jews' Synagogue. The streets of Rams gate (Harbour Street, High Street, and Queen Street, being the chief), are well paved and brilliantly lighted with gas. The Improvement Commissioners own both the gas and water works. There are banking establishments, a savings bank, with a literary institute, assembly rooms, several good libraries, dispensary, town-hall, custom-house, music-hall, &c. An excellent promenade on the West Cliff, laid out in an ornamental manner, forms a delightful source of healthy recreation. In 1859, during certain alterations of a sanitary nature, a num ber of coins were found in the \" Roman trenches ; \" they are of the year 48. The markets are extremely well supplied with meat, excellent fish, <fcc. : and few places on the coast are so cheap as well as healthy and agreeable for a summer's residence. The environs of Ramsgate"], [101, "63 are charmingly picturesque and diversi fied. There are several handsome resi dences. East Clitf Lodge, pleasantly situated about a mile to the north-east of the town, is a large marine villa, belonging to Sir Moses Montefiore. Arklow House, the property of G. S. Moasom, Esq., J.P., is noteworthy as the last residence of Mrs. Elizabeth Fry.

The towers, all that remain of the ancient church, were pur chased by the corporation of the Trinity House, of the parish in 1810, and groins have been laid down for their preserva tion. According to an account written by a Dominican snar of Canterbury, who quitted England at the time of the Reformation, for Louvain, where he died, and bequeathed his collection of MSS. to its University, the designation of the \" Two Sisters \" arose thus : Frances St. Clair, Lady Abbess of Benedictine Nuns at Faversham, being visited by a violent sickness, vowed that, in the event of arches of such large capacity as to resem ble rooms, which are cut at right angles through the chalky cliffs opening to the sea, and these arches being in summer carpeted with turf, and covered with shrubs and flowers, appear very pictur esque.

ROCHESTER (STATION).\u2014 An episcopal city and parliamentary recovery, she would visit the shrine of tlie blessed virgin at Bradstow (Broad stairs), and there offer up a costly present in gratitude for the Virgin's intercession in her behalf. In fulfilment whereof, she embarked on board a vessel, accompanied by her sister Isabel, to whom she was much attached, on the 3rd of May, the feast of the Holy Cross ; but they had not been at sea two hours before a storm arose, which drove the vessel on a sand bank near Reculver. Part of the crew succeeded in reaching the shore in a boat, but Isabel, who remained on board the wreck for some hours, although rescued from it afterwards, died the following day from exhaustion. To perpetuate tha memory of this event, aud to serve as a guide to mariners, the Abbess, who, with all the passengers, had been saved, caused the church towers to be repaired, and two spiral elevations to be added, which she directed should be called the Sisters. The church was founded in the seventh century, together with a monastery for Black Canons, by one Basse, upon land granted to him by Egbert, King of Kent. King Ethelbert, the Britwald, retired here after his conversion, and is said to be buried in the Abbey. Ethelbert the Second, king of Kent, who died in 760, was interred here. There are considerable remains of the Regulbium \u2014 a Roman fort, within the walls of which the royal palace of Ethelbert, and the monastery before mentioned, were erected. Roman coins, tesselated pavements, cellars, cis terns, fibuke, and a variety of trinkets, with some British and Saxon coins, have been discovered. By the fall of tho cliff at different times, lumps of metal have been met with, seeming to indicate the destruction of the place by fire. There can be no doubt that, besides being a Roman station of iinpi'rtancq, it was the site of a large town inhabited by that people. Hilborough is on the line of Roman Road to Durovernum. At Bishopslon e and at Regulbium Camp are coast-guard stations. A considerable part of the parish adjoining the river is marsh.

Rochester is a city of great antiquity ; the ancient Britons called it \"Dur-brif\"; the Ro mans, whose Watling Street crossed the water here, \" Durobriv\u00e6 \" ; the Saxons \" Hrofecastre \" \u2014 Horf's castle, of which appellation Rochester is a corruption. At a very early period it was a consider able military station, as Bede terms it \" the castle of the Kentish men,\" and a fortress tppears to have been erected here, possibly to guard the passage over the river. The manor was given by the Conqueror to his brother Odo, bishop of Bayeaux, who built the present castle, of which he was dispossessed by Rufus for revolting against his authority. In the reign of Henry I. the archbishops of Canterbury were its constables, but held that office only until the reign of Stephen. During the struggle between John and his barons, the castle was held by William de Albini, against the king, but was taken by the Royalists, and afterwards retaken by the Dauphin of Frauce. In the contest between Henry III. and Simon de Montfort, it was garrisoned by the king, and unsuccessfully besieged by Leicester, who, however, burnt the priory bridge and a great part of the city. The castle was repaired by Edward IV., but soon after fell to decay. In 676 the city wa3 destroyed by Ethelred, the Mercian, and in 830 by the Danes, who besieged it in 885, but were compelled to raise the siege by Alfred. In 986 it was besieged by Ethelred ; in 998 sacked by the Danes. In 930 Athelstan established three mints in the city, and Canute landed here; the city suffered severely from five fires in the twelfth century. Wat Tyler attacked the castle; in 1251 a grand tournament between English and foreign knights was held here ; and in 1688 James IL, on his abdication, em barked for the continent from Rochester. Tho city has returned two members to Parliament from an early period. The see was founded and a church built by Ethelbert, after his conversion by Augus tine, who also founded a monastery, both which buildings were partially destroyed by the Danes, but were re-established by Bishop Gundulf, who also displaced the secular canons, and established a Benedictine monastery of sixty monks. In 1201 a Scotch baker, going on pil grimage to Jerusalem, being killed on his passage through Kent, was buried in Rochester cathedral, canonized as St. William, and his shrine became a great place of devotion. The cathedral, a fine old edifice, was commenced by Ethelbert, and is a fine specimen of the Anglo- Saxon and Norman styles, but very little of the original building remains. The castle, built in the reign of the Con queror, is a massive Norman erection, of which the keep still remains \u2014 a fine feature in the landscape, lt is 70 feet square at the base, and 104 feet high. Portions of the wall of St. Andrew's priory (founded in the year 600), of St. William's gates, and St. Catherine's hospital for lepers are still standing. The city was incorporated by Henry IL, the charter b.eing confirmed by subse quent monarchs, the governing charter to the time of the Municipal Act being that of Charles I., which granted a mayor, recorder, and twelve aldermen. The cor poration is the urban sanitary authority. There are waterworks and gasworks vested in companies. Public recreation grounds have been provided by the cor poration, notably those adjoining the castle, and are much frequented by the citizens. There are separate burial boards for the several parishes within the city, new grounds having been provided for interments ; and there is a cemetery on the Maidstone road. Besides the cathe dral and castle, are the parish church of St. Nicholas, rebuilt in 1624, and re cently renovated at a considerable ex pense; the church of St. Margaret, founded by Bishop Gundulf and rebuilt in 1829; St. Peter's district church, built in 1859 ; and chapels belonging to the Independents, Bibie Christians, Presby terians, Wesleyans, Primitive Methodists, Irvingites, Roman Catholics, and Swe denborgians. Other public buildings are \u2014 the town hall, police station, custom house, corn exchange, market house, military hospital, and Fort Clarence"], [105, "67 military prison, and a fine bridge which spans the Medway, built in 1857 in place of an older bridge erected in the reign of King John. The town quay and landing place was completed by the cor poration, at great cost. The markets fer cattle have been altered and greatly im proved, and extensive dredging opera tions are continually being carried on in the river, under the directions of the cor poration. The cathedral grammar school, founded by Henry VIII. in 1542, and Williamson's free mathematical school for the sons of freemen, are the chief schools ; besides which may be mentioned Hayward's schools, the national schools, etc. The charities comprise Watt's hospi tal,Sir John Hayward's house of industry, St. Bartholomew's hospital, erected from the funds of St. Bartholomew's charity, St. Thomas' hospital, St. Catherine's hos pital, and other charities, the whole of which are dispensed by a body of seven teen trustees.

There are gas works and a capital water supply. The town was a busy spot in olden times, it being in the direct coach road to the south-eastern coast. The county assizes were held here in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The parish church of St. Nicholas contains some fine monuments \u2014 amongst others to William Lambarde the Kentish historian, who died in 1601, and Charles, Earl Whitworth. There are also memorials to Earl Amherst"], [106, "68 and Admiral Amherst. Several in- scriptions commemorate the Lambarde, Farnaby, Petley, Streatfeild, Curteis, Theobald, and Fermor families. There is also an inscription to Lady Margaret Boswell (temp. Chas. I.), enumerating her charities. St. John's is a district church, and there are several Noncon- formist chapels.

Sevenoaks is, however, chiefly noted for its contiguity to the noble mansion of tbe Sackvilles \u2014 Knole Park \u2014 on the south-east side of the town. It encloses an area of more than 1 ,600 acres, and is nearly six miles in circum ference, of undulating surface, most judiciously planted, and abundantly timbered with spreading elms, stately beeches, and venerable oaks, some of which have attained enormous size : besides which, there are many of ground. It is built chiefly in the castellated style, with numerous square towers, and two embattled gateways or tower-portals \u2014 one leading to the outer, the other to the inner quadrangle. The first* room we shall notice is the Hall, a noble apartment about seventy-five feet in length, including the screen, twenty seven feet in breadth, and about twenty six feet eight inches in height. At one end is a fine Grecian relic, iu marbl9, of Demosthenes in the act of delivering an oration,\" which was purchased in"], [107, "69 Italy for seven hundred pounds. There are also several pieces of sculpture of great merit, and some pictures ; one representing \" Dover Castle and the adjacent country,\" painted by Wotton, in 1727. The curious irons in the fire place, on which are tbe arms and initials of Henry the Eighth, conjciutly with those of Bcleyn, were purchased at a sale at Hever Castle. The long oak table was constructed for the ancient game of shovel-board. The Brown or Horn Gallery is eighty-eight feet in length, and is chiefly tilled with portraits of the Reformers and illustrious persons of the time of Henry the Eighth. On the right of this gallery is an apartment containing some excellent paintings and tapestry, and an oak bedstead of great antiquity. On the left of the gallery is the Spangled Bed Boom, so called from the bed and furniture being covered with spangles. There is also some tapestry by Reydam, which, with the whole of the furniture in this room, with a few excep tions, was presented by James the First to Lionel, fifth Earl of Middlesex, from whom it descended to the Sackville family. In the adjoining Dressing Boom are several valuable pictures by tbe Old Masters, and others. The Billiard Boom and Leicester Gallery contain some rare paintings by Vandyke, Holbein, Mytens, <fec. The views from the windows are highly pleasing, overlooking the pleasure grounds. The Venetian Bed Boom is so called from having been the sleeping apartment of Nicolo Molino, a Venetian ambassador. The State bed, with its green velvet furniture, was prepared for King James the Second, who was ex pected to honour Knole with a visit, but did not arrive. In this and the ad joining dressing room are some speci mens of Domenichino, and others. The Organ Boom is a rude-looking apart ment, the walls being covered with oak, unpauelled. Here will be seen the remains of an organ said to have been the second made in England. It is placed so that the organist could observe the altar and officiating priests, while he himself, unseen from the chapel, per formed the requisite music. There is an old oak chest here, grotesquely carved, which belonged to the travelling equipage of Lord Buckhurst, at the time when it was the custom to draw travel- ling chariots with teams of oxen. Ad joining this room is the pew or gallery, looking down into the chapel, which preserves much of its original character, although the ceiling, formerly panelled oak, is now a stuccoed imitation of vault ing. There is a fine crypt beneath the chapel, with a vaulted roof. The chapel, or Passage Boom, is highly interesting. The walls are hung with tapestry, repre senting, in compartments, the history of Noah, the building of the Ark, &c. The most curious relics in this room are those upon the ancient chestnut cabinet. This is a group of figures, most elaborately carved, presented by Mary, Queen of Scots, a short time previous to her exe cution, to tho second Earl of Dorset. The subjects are, Christ's entry into Jerusalem, his Bearing the Cross, Taking down from the Cross, the Entombment. In one of the rooms, on the left of the entrance +o the chapel, is a curious old chimneypiece, which bears the cog nizance of Archbishop Bourchier. In the Ball Boom are portraits, chiefly of the family, by Vandyke, Mytens, (fee. The Crimson Drawing Boom contains several splendid paintings by Titian, Veronese, Vandyke, Teniers, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Lely, (fee. There iB also a remarkably fine marble chimneypiece, and other curious objects. The Cartoon Gallery displays copies, by Daniel Mytens, of six of the cartoons of Raphael, and rare specimens by the Old Masters. The State Canopy, with its appendages, was used by the Duke of Dorset, when ambassador at the court of Louis the Sixteenth. The King's Bed Boom is so called from having been pre pared for the reception of James the First. It is splendidly fitted up. The walls are hung with tapestry, represent ing tho life of Nebuchadnezzar. The State bed alone is said to have cost eight thousand pounds, and the entire fittings of the room upwards of tweuty thousand pounds.

Sheerness forms, with Chatham, the district of a special stipendiary magis trate. The town owes its importance principally to its government dockyard and its situation at the mouth of the Medway. It is strongly fortified, and there are also a large fort and artillery barracks at the Island of Grain, on the opposite bank of the river. A large fleet generally lies in the roadstead, which is known as the Nore, and was the scene of the naval mutiny in 1797. In 1667 the Dutch Admiral De Ruyter, sailed up the Medway, after taking the then existing fort, and doing great damage to the works. The dockyards give em ployment to nearly 2,000 men. The district church of St. Paul's was built in 1871. Sheerness-on-Sea is the modern extension of the town, and is rapidly obtaining the reputation of a favourite sea-side resort. It has a well-built esplanade. Holy Trinity Church was built in 1836, and there are numerous Nonconformist chapels. Population of the town : about 20,000.

It is situated in a fer- tile valley, about three miles broad, aud is well built. The public edifices include a commercial college, a school of design, hospitals, public libraries, <fec. The Chateau d'Eau in the neighbourhood was the favourite marine residence of King Louis Philippe. The Somme intersects the town, forming a small island on which the principal part of Abbeville is built. Three small affluents of the Somme likewise flow through the town, so that a large number of bridges are required to facilitate the communi cation. The ramparts, which are flanked with bastions and surrounded by broad ditches, form an agreeable promenade. There is a considerable commerce in corn, oil, linseed, and hemp, by means of the Somme, which is navigable up to the town at high water, by vessels of 150 tons. There are also extensive manufactories of woollen cloths, &c, cavalry and infantry barracks. The principal attraction of Abbeville is the cathedral, dedicated to St. Wulfran. The building is of ancient date, but was reconstructed in the sixteenth century. The date of 1513, inscribed in the roof of the choir, establishes the date of this restoration. One of the great charms of the edifice is its picturesque irregularity, and the profusion of beautiful sculptures, also the numberless niches aud statues with fretwork and carving which en counter the eye everywhere. A square tower rises on each side of the gateway, each richly ornamented. The interior of the cathedral is very striking, despite the tawdry tinsel which covers the altars. The altar of St. Wulfran was for several centuries the object of peculiar venera tion. It was here that an oath, or probe test, was administered to individuals suspected of having robbed their neigh bours, and to the workmen employed in the Mint, in order to keep them honest. There are few remains of antiquity in Abbeville except this church ; and the"], [116, "78 prison, composed of portions of the castle, formerly belonging to the Counts of Ponthieu, which was so splendid as to be tbe pride of Picardy. The three celebrated geographers of the seven teenth century, Philip Briet, Peter Duval, and Nicholas Sanson, and the poet Millevoye, were natives of Abbe ville. The population is nearly 18,000. The battle-field of Agincourt is distant from Abbeville about seven miles. Both Agincourt and Crecy are reached by diligences. Abbeville was occupied by the Germans in 1871. Principal Hotels : De France ; Du Commerce ; and Tete de B\u0153uf. building, such as can be nowhere ex celled. The stalls in the choir are richly carved, and represent the principal personages and events in the Holy Scriptures ; the stained glass win dows are among the finest that France contains. In one of the towers, a small chamber is shown where, according to tradition, Henry the Fourth posted himself to watch the movements of the Spanish army. The steeple, which is 201 feet from its base to the summit, and 402 feet from the ground, was the work of a common carpenter. The en tire length of the Cathedral is 442 feet, and its vault is half as high again as the roof of Westminster Abbey. \" The interior is one of the most magnificent, spectacles that architectural skill can ever have produced. The mind is filled and elevated by its enormous height (140 feet), its lofty and many-coloured clere story, its grand proportions, and its noble simplicity. The proportion of height to breadth is almost double that to which we are accustomed in English cathedrals ; the lofty, Bolid piers, which bear up this height, are far more massive in their plan than the light and graceful clusters of our English churches, each of them being a cylinder with four engaged columns. The polygonal E apse is a feature which we seldom see, and no where so exhibited and on such a scale ; and the peculiar French arrangement which puts the walls at the outside edge of the buttresses, and thus forms in terior chapels all round, in addition to the aisles, gives a vast multiplicity of perspective below, which fills out the idea produced by the gigantio height of the centre. Such terms will not be con sidered extravagant when it is recol lected that the vault is half as high again as the roof of Westminster Abbey.\" \u2014 Whewell. The city is situated on the river Somme, at an altitude of 400 feet above sea-level. It is the see of a bishop, who is a suffragan of Rheims, and whose diocese comprises the department of the Somme. It is also the seat of a Court of Assize, a tribunal of commerce, a school of medicine, an imperial college, an academy of science, and possesses several normal schools, a public library, and botanical garden. The weaving of cotton-velvet, and spin ning of cotton and woollen yarns, form AMIENS. \u2014 A large city and forti fied town of the department oiLa Somme, and the principal station on the North em of France Railway in connection with the English mail and tidal routes to and from Paris. Lines branch off here, from the main road, in every direction. The Cathedral, one of the most magnificent churches in Europe, is raised upon the ruins of an ancient temple which was destroyed by light ning. The present edifice was com menced in 1220, and finished fifty years afterwards. The exterior of the Cathe dral is distinguished by much grandeur and beauty ; the decorations of the en trances, the elaborate sculptures and tracery work, the majestic proportions of the supporting towers, altogether strik ing the eye with marvellous effect. But it is the interior which commands the greatest admiration. Three vast and deeply recessed portals lead into it, the arches supported by a long array of statues in niches instead of pillars, while rows of statuettes supply the place of mouldings, so that the whole forms one mass of sculpture ; an arrangement of constant occurrence in French Gothic, though rare in English. The sculpture of these porches merits attention ; over the centre door the bas-relief represents the Last Judgment, the statues are those of the twelve Apostles. Over the right hand porch are the Death and Assump tion of tha Virgin ; over that on the left is the legend of St. Firmin, the apostle of Picardy. Above tbe portals runs a colossal line of French kings, behind which appears a noble wheel- window. The nave is a perfect chef d'ceuvre of Gothic art, and the view of the whole"], [117, "79 the principal manufactures of the place. Amiens was anciently the capital of Picardy. In the time of Julius C\u00e6sar, it was called Samarobriva, and it was here that Valentinian proclaimed his son Gratian by the title of Augustus. Amiens has been the scene of great his torical events in ancient and modern times. It was taken by the Spaniards in 1597. The stratagem by which the Spanish general gained possession of the place is curious and well known. He caused a cartload of nuts to be over turned at one of the gates ; and, while the guard was scrambling for the fruit, he tub hed into the town with a chosen body of men which he had placed in ambush. The fortress was soon after retaken by Henry IV. It was here that the celebrated \" Treaty \" of 1802 was concluded between Great Britain, France, Spain, and the Batavian re public. The city wears a business aspect, and contains numerous manufac tories of beet- root sugar, soap, tanneries, and paper-mills ; also dyeing, bleaching, and chemical works. Pates de canards are made here in large quantities. Among the most striking public build ings are the Chateau d' Eau, the Palais dc Justice, the Hdtel de Ville (built by Henry IV.), the Corn Market, <fec. Leading from the Boulevarde Fontaine is the Grande Rue de Beauvais, answer ing to the once existent gate. Turning down this, the visitor will see a vast building of plain exterior, but covering an immense area of ground. This is the Hospital for Deserted Children. On the Boulevard St. Jacques, is a vista of thickly-planted trees, the pride of the city, and called the Promenade de la Hotoie. In the heart of the town is a handsome Marche aux Heches, or covered fruit and vegetable market. There is a large Theatre at Amiens, in the principal street, the Bue des Trois Cailloux. Not far from the radway station is the Place St. Denis, a neat little square with a central statue, and bordered by rows of acacias. The Abbey of St. Acheul, on the outskirts of the town, was converted into a Jesuits' college under the Restoration. The crypt under the church contains some ancient tombs and bas-reliefs. Estimated population : 50,000. After the defeat of the French army of the Nortli in 1871 by General Manteuffel, the Germans occupied Amiens. Princi pal Hotels : De France et d'Angleterre ; Du Rhin ; and De l'Univers. BOULOGNE (generally styled BOULOGNE-SUR-MER, to distinguish it from Boulogne near Paris). \u2014 This town, seaport and tidal packet station, is in the arrondissement of tho same name and in the D^partement of the Pas-de- Calais. The harbour is formed in the channel of the Liane, with the addition of a semi-circular basin on the left bank of the river, which was originally dug to contain Napoleon's celebrated flotilla, intended for the invasion of England. The increasing importance of Boulogne required that this basin should be im proved and rendered serviceable for merchant vessels of considerable tonnage. In the year 1860, the works for deepen ing and forming a large floating dock were commenced, and are extremely commodious, being sheltered from tem pestuous gales, the high grounds on each side of the Liane forming a natural protection from the north-east and south, whilst an artificial barrier has been raised to protect the shipping from the west, on the summit of which is placed a battery. The railway has a branch line alongside the harbour, by which passengers alight frem the trains to the boats, and vice versa. The entrance to the harbour is bounded by two jetties : that to the west is solid up to the level of high water, and is thrown out along the line of the rocky shore a length of 1,970 feet; the other, to the east, runs directly out to the sea ; and the bottom of the inter vening channel is 230 feet in width. Spring-tides rise 24 feet, and neap-tides 17 feet ; but when it blows from the west, the springs rise 28 feet, and the neaps 19 feet. The French Government having resolved to construct a deep sea harbour at Boulogne, the necessary works wer.. commenced in 1879. This gigantic undertaking, by which in a quiet and unpretentious way France is securing on her northern coast the possi bility of a naval station that shall be one of the finest in the world, is under taken by the Government of the Re public. That it will, when completed, entirely revolutionise the inter-com munication of England and France, is a consideration of prime importance to"], [118, "80 the travelling public. But, at the same time, and without detriment to this object, it is clear that France will have here a magnificent harbour in which all her fleet can safely lie at anchor. The harbour will cover an area of 800 acres, and steamers will be able to approach the jetty in 27 feet of water at low tide. This enclosure is to be completed by two breakwaters running far out into the sea, the longer one being in the shape of an arm bent at the elbow, and so encir cling the harbour on two sides. The works are necessarily of the most massive construction, and, like Rome, the har bour may not be built in a day. It is now, however, in full progress ; and when a certain stage is reached, the English interests (represented by the South Eastern Railway Company) havo undertaken to build corresponding works on their side, though, of course, not on the same large scale. The object of the South Eastern Company is to create the possibility of making tho journey from London to Paris in eight hours, by a fixed service independent of the tide. These harbours, navigable from either side in any state of the tide, will make this hitherto unapproachable design a matter of course. With deep sea harbours even larger vessels than those now owned by the South Eastern will become possible, and the horrors of the Channel passage will practically be annihilated. Boulogne has considerable claims to antiquity. The name by which it was known to the Romans was Ges soriacum. About the commencement of the Christian era, a fort was built a little to tho north of Gessoriaeum, on the other side of the Liane, to which the name of Bononia was given, and this name was ultimately identified with the town itself. The Normans sacked Bou logne in 882. Henry III. of England made a fruitless attack upon it in 1347. Henry VIII. made himself master of it in 1544, and Edward VI. restored it to France for 400,000 crowns. After the destruction of Therouane by Charles V. in 1553, the episcopal seat was trans ported to Boulogne, where it existed until 1789. Napoleon elevated the town into celebrity by making it the rendez vous of the \" Grand Arm^e \" destined for the invasion of England in 1804. The port was unsuccessfully attacked by Nelson on the 15th August, 1801, and by Admiral Keith, August 10th, 1804 ; but, on the defeat of tho combined French and Spanish fleets in 1805, the camp at Boulogne was broken up, and the troops were marched to the Rhino. The manufactures of Boulogne consist of ropes, fishing -nets, leather, bricks, linen and woollen stuffs, pens, crino lines, and bottles. The town carries on an active trade in fresh and salt fish, of which vast quantities are transported to Paris. Boulogne consists of two towns, an upper and a lower ; the former is the older portion, and occupies the summit of a hill; it is encircled by ramparts with arched gateways, and has an old castle at the east angle, divided from the town by a fosse ; the ramparts rise from 15 to 20 yards above the level of their base, and are surmounted by two rows of trees, forming a most delightful promenade. The high and low towns are connected by means of a steep street, called La Grand Rue. The favourite locality of the English is in the modern part, called Tintilleries, which lies in a valley towards the north. The Haute Ville, or Upper Town, contains the Hotel de Ville, or Town Hall, built on the site of the ancient palace of the counts, the birthplace of Godfrey de BouilloD. The Belfroi, behind the Hotel de Ville, is one of the most ancient buildings in Boulogne; tbe tower, 110 feet high, affords a magnificent prospect from its summit of the town and the surround ing country. The Palais de Justice, or Court House, is also situated in the upper town, together with the Church of Notre Dame, raised chiefly by the exer tions of the Abb6 Haffreingue. It is built on the site of the ancient Cathedral of Boulogne, covering an extensive crypt, which merits the interest and admira tion it universally obtains. On the 15th of August, every year, and for 14 subsequent days, pilgrimages to the shrine of Notre Dame de Boulogne draw together a great number of devotees from all parts of France to this church. The castle, long the residence of tbe military governors of the Boulonnais, is now an ordnance magazine and military prison. In the Rue du Chateau is the abode where the immortal author of Gil Bias (Le Sage) died. Passing out at the Porte Gayole, and continuing to the left"], [119, "81 \u2022 brough the promenade Des Petits Arbres, a road conducts to the pretty little cimeticre. Returning by the same road, passing the Church of St. Joseph, and leaving the Haute Ville by the Porte des Dunes, the Basse Ville, or Lower Town, built on the slope of the hill which descends from the ramparts \u2014 a larger, more populated, and more commercial district than the upper\u2014 is passed, lt is divided into two parts by the River Liane and the harbour. One is known by the name of Capdcure, and contains the Northern Railway Station and a number of villas and country nouses, which are much sought after \u2022during the summer season. The other part, which properly constitutes the lower town, contains, in the Grand Rue, the library, composed of more than 40,000 volumes, and open to the public every day but Saturday, from ten till rour o'clock. In the same building is the museum, ranking, from the impor tance of its specimens, third in France, \u25a0c-pen to the public on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, and to strangers every day from ten till four o'clock. Here w*_l be seen several paintings of merit, and an interesting collection of curiosities. Close to the -museum is the Church of St. Nicholas. The theatre, in the Rue Monsigny ; the concert-room, in tbe Rue Siblequin; the 'Sub-Prefectorate, on the Esplanade ; the Post-Ofiice, in the Rue des Vieillards ; -the Custom House and the Chamber of Commerce, on the Quai des Paquebots ; British Consulate, Grande Rue ; Electric Telegraph Office, 12, Rue Pot d'Etain ; the Etablissement des Bains, the princi- pal hotels, snd the most important shops, \u25a0complete the public buildings of Bou- logne. There are several English Episcopal Chapels, one in the Haute Ville, tlie others in the lower town. The bathing establishment is placed on a terrace which looks upon the beach, from whence one may enjoy at the same time a view of the town, the interior of the port, and the agreeable sites cf \u2022Outreau and Capecure. The English \u2022coast in fine weather is clearly marked \u25a0on the horizon. The establishment is composed of a handsome saloon, measur- ing 28 metres in length, by 13 metres in width and 14 metres in height, with \u2022card, reading, aud billiard rooms, a skating rink, swimming schools, and hot and cold baths, and is open from the 15th of June to the 15th of October. A great number of bathing - machines, large enough to hold several persons with ease, are stationed upon the beach, and from five o'clock in the morning until eight o'clock in the evening are in readiness. Those for ladies are attended by bathing-women, and the gentlemen's machines by experienced sailors, all of whom are good swimmers. An active and vigilant look-out against accidents is constantly kept by steady men, whom the Humane and Shipwreck Society maintain at their own expense. The beach of Boulogne is one of tbe finest on the coast. Alibert, in his \" EhSniens de Therapeutique,\" remarks on its ad vantages with enthusiasm. \"Nature,\" he says, \" seems to have done everything to favour the sea-baths of Boulogne. An immense sandy beach, uniformly firm and even,offurs to bathers every possible security. The ground is always the same, whether the tide be high or low : no loose or shifting sands, no stones or pebbles. This plain of sand stretches from north to south as far as the eye can reach, and is from 2,500 to 3,000 yards wide at low water. When the tide is high, the water flows up to the foot of the terrace of the establishment. The coast is formed by steep, rugged cliffs of immense height, so that that part of the beach devoted to sea-bathing is sheltered from the nortli and east winds, and also from the south-east, which is by far the driest and most disagreeable of all ; thus the bathers, while in the water, receive only tho western breeze, a most rare union of favourable conditions. It is also worthy of remark that, by a most fortunate arrangement, the harbour being formed from east to west, and the beach running in a parallel line to this direction, the bathers constantly receive the influence of the solar rays, which must necessarily add to the salutary effects that wo seek to obtain from bathing\" The Ferruginous Mineral Spring, which is known tinder the name of \u00abhe \" Iron Fountain,\" is situated in a well, covered by a kiosk, a few hundred yards from thc ramparts, on the road from Boulogne to Calais. It yields an abundance of cold and perfectly limpid water, of a slightly rough, astringent,"], [120, "82 and ferruginous taste. Its use is attended with most satisfactory results in complaints of the digestive organs ; it acts most efficaciously in those very cases for which sea-baths themselves are espe cially recommended. One of the princi pal objects of attraction to the visitors of Boulogne is the Column of Napoleon, situated on a hill to the east of the town, about a quarter of a mile distant. Its total height is 164 feet, diameter 13 feet; a bronze statue of the Emperor, in his coronation robes, by Bosio, 16 feet in height, surmounts the whole, giving a total of _ 76 feet. The base is a square pedestal, with a flight of steps leading up to it < n each side. It is constructed of marble, from the quarries of Marquise in the neighbourhood. This column was intended to commemorate the invasion of England by Napoleon. The first stone was laid in 1804 by Marshal Soult. According to the inscription on the key stone, it was finished by Louis XVIII., to \"commemorate his happy return to his country,\" in 1814. A magnificent view is afforded from the heights on which Caligula's Tower is situated. This is a favourite promenade of those visitors who enjoy the invigorating sea-breeze which renders Boulogne so healthful a residence. In juxta position i3 a statue in honour of Napoleon I., erected by Mr. A. K. Kent. Boulogne is surrounded by a charming country, intersected by wide and hand some roads. The population is estimated at 40,000, and the number of passengers passing through the port every year is over a quarter of a million. Principal Hotels: Christol and Bristol ; Des Bains; and Imperial. BOVES. \u2014 A small commune in the department of the Somme, and chiefly remarkable for the ruinsof its old castle, which was the residence oi the celebrated Gabriel d'Estrtes, mistress of Henry the Fourth of France. Estimated Popu lation: about 1,800. CALAIS. \u2014 This town, seaport, and mail-packet station (in connection with the London Chatham and Dover Channel Service), is in the department of Pas-de-Calais, and arrondissement of Boulogne. The town is supposed to occupy the place of the ancient Portus Ulterior. 1 1 wa s fortified about 1 228, by Philip of France, Count of Boulogne. In 1347 it was taken by capitulation, after a siege of thirteen months, by Edward the Third of England, and held by the English until 1558, when it wa* regained to France bythe Duke of Guise. In 1596 it was captured by the Archduke Albert, but restored by the treaty of Vervins. It is believed to have been the first place ajrainst which cannon were employed. Tbe harbour is defended by severalsmall forts, and is easy of entrance,. there being no difficulty of landing in. boats or lying at anchor. It is now undergoing considerable enlargement and extension, and will, when completed, admit vessels of large size. The coast, too, is perfectly safe to approach in thick weather, shoaling gradually towards the shore, so that a vessel may feel her way ; the piers are well constructed; the light- house is remarkably handsome, and the light most brilliant. The pier of Calais is an agreeable promenade, nearly three- quarters of a mile long. It is decorated with a pillar, raised to commemorate the return of Louis the Eighteenth to France. The Phare de Calais, or lighthouse, was erected in 1845-7, and is fitted up with great attention to ornament as well, as- use. The ascent up the handsome well staircase of 188 steps is by no mean* fatiguing, and seats to rest the short breathed climber are placed at regular intervals. To the east stretches the ex- panse of sandy dune, which continues its. level course to Gravelines and Dun- kerque ; and beyond them, in the back- ground, rises a range of picturesque hills\u201e crowned bythe forest of Guines and the quarries of Ferques, to terminate at once in the hunchback of Cape Blanez and the- frightful precipice with which it meets the sea ; and if the visitor is acquainted with the locality he will pick up a mul- titudeofdispersedandinteresting objects, united to his view, for the first time, in this wide-spreadbird's-eye picture. The town (which contains a population of over 13,000) is situated on the coast of the channel to which it gives its name \u2014 the Pas-de-Calais of France, or the Straits of Dover of England. It is of great strength, possessing extensive ramparts, a good citadel, and a fortified gate. It consists of two parts, separated by an esplanade. The faubourg de Courgain extends to the north-east, along the coast, and is chiefly occupied by a seafaring"], [121, "\u25a062. population ; the other district, inappro priately designated the upper town, is generally well built, with broad and regularly formed streets. Near the centre is the parade, which is of some extent, and is adorned with handsome edifices. The chief buildings in Calais are the parish church, built during the \u2022occupation of the town by the English, in the fourteenth century, the town-hall, the watch-tower, and the inns. At Dessin's hotel m ay be seen the bed-rooms occupied by Sir Walter Scott and Sterne. The gateway near the railway station is that through which access is obtained to the town from the port. Besides these, there are a custom-house, bank, college, several schools, a library, hospital, public baths, posting establishment, barracks, Ac. The inhabitants are chiefly engaged in the herring and cod fishery, and carry \u2022on a considerable traffic in Dutch spirits. The steamers from Dover and London, and the railway communication to Paris, Brussels, and all parts of Belgium, give an animation to this otherwise mono tonous and uninteresting town. Its -short distance from Dover, and being the mail station for England, contributes greatly to the prosperity of Calais. Principal Hotels : De Paris ; Dessin ; and Du Commerce, Just is deficient in interesting scenery, and the land wears a barren aspect. The town contains a population of nearly six thousand, chiefly engaged in cilico bleaching and trading in agricultural produce. Upon the ruins of the ancient castle of the Princes de CondtS, a prison has been built. At the foot of this structure is an agreeable promenade, called Li Chatellier. The antiquary should visit the interesting church of Clermont, commenced in the fourteenth century and completed in the sixteenth. The Hotel de Ville is also curious; it was built in the reign of Philip le Bel, who was born at Clermont. This town is celebrated for the successful cultivation of many varieties of choice fruits, more especially cherries, which are produced in great abundance. Principal Hotel : Des Deux Epees. CREIL. \u2014 A small town in the de partment of Oise. The populace find employment in the manufacture of por celain, besides trading in timber, oil and corn. Creil has much diminished in importance since it had a royal palace on an island in the river Oise, of which there are some remains. Estimated population: 2,500. Principal Hotel: Chemin de Fer (Railway). ETAPLES (and MONTREUIL).\u2014 A small commune in the department of the Pas de Calais. It is situated on the river Canche, near its mouth, and which is here crossed by a viaduct 900 feet in length. The castle, built in 1160, is now a ruin. It was here that the treaty between Henry VII. of Eng land and Charles VIII. of France was signed. There are several breweries and distilleries at Etaples, and it has a small trade in salt. Population: about 2,000. From Etaples a short branch line con nects Montreuil, a town and fortress of the second class, on the banks of the river Canche, in the department of the Pas de Calais. It has a court of first re sort, an agricultural society and com munal college. The church is a lofty edifice, in the Plantagenet style. The manufacture of soap is carried on ; and there are breweries, tanneries, a paper mill sugar-refinery, tfce. A large export trads with England is done in the table delicacy kuown as \" pates-de-becasses.\" The town, wliich contains a population of nearly 4,000, is enclosed by a rampart, CHANTILLY.\u2014 Asmallcommune, in the department of Seine et Oise, about twenty-five miles north of Paris. Chan tilly is frequently called the French \u25a0\"Newmarket\" from the fact that the French Jockey Club have here their race-course and training-grounds. The racing-stables accommodate laige studs of race-horses, and the English colony number nearly a third of the population \u2022of the commune. It was at Chantilly thatthegreat Conde' received Louis XIV. in 1671. The Due d'Aumale is the owner of the restored chateau, which contains some fine paintings, and has a chapel, theatre, stables for 400 horses, and a park. The church possesses many tombs of the CondiS family. The forest adjoining Chantilly affords capital hunt ing, covering as it does a space of nearly 7,000 acres. Population : 3,000. Prin cipal Hotels : Des Baines ; Du Cerf ; Du Cygne. CLERMONT.\u2014 A small town and commune of the department of Oise. The country between Clermont and St."], [122, "84 and is divided into an upper and lower town, defended by a strong hill fortress. The fortifications are very ancient. The kings of France had a palace here in the thirteenth century. The town was ceded to the English by the treaty of Brittany. In 1537 Charles the Fifth burned the town, and in 1554 it was again destroyed by the Spaniards. Tbe wife of Philip the First was imprisone 1 in what is known as Queen Bertha's Tower : her harsh cap tivity ended her life. NOYELLES (and ST. VALERY). \u2014 A small commune in the department of the Somme. The place owes such importance as it possesses to being the point of junction for a branch railway to St. Valeey \u2014 an ancient and pic turesque town at the mouth of the river Somme, which in some of its features is not unlike the town of Bou logne. St. Valery is rapidly increasing in estimation as a watering-place. It was from here William the Conqueror set sail for the iuvasion of England, which fact is recorded on a tablet in the centre of the town. Estimated Population : 4,000. Principal Hotel : De France. PARIS. \u2014 A guide to the great city whose proud boast it is to be \" the heart of the world,\" is not within the scope of this work, which deals pro fessedly and almost exclusively with the places en route to and from London. Some valuable suggestions to travellers and visitors will, however, bo found in the Introduction (page xix), and a list of those public buildings, ifec, which are only open to public inspection at stated hours is here appended. As connected with the railway, a description of the terminus of tbe Chemin de Fer du Nord (Northern of France Railway), will be appropriate. The general plan of the station is a quadrilateral of about 180 x 208 yards, thus comprising a super ficies of 34,000 yards. It includes five principal parts \u2014 namely, a grand hall, the salles de depart, followed by what we may call the station proper, where the tickets are distributed ; and on the left the salles d'arrive'e, and covered accommodation for the vehicles in waiting. In the interior are nine lines of rail, separated by four large and six smaller platforms. The building com posing the facade comprises the Salon, with its accessory chambers, the post and telegraph offices, the bureaux of the station-masters, and waiting-rooms for tlie convenience of tho passenger traffic. The single roof over the hall gives it a very characteristic appearance. The architecture of this embarcadere is as unpretending as it is graceful ; a simple cornice crowns the centre ofthe fafade, which is decorated with eight pilasters, rising two by two, and indicating the form and proportions of the nave. The central arch has an elevation of rather more than 100ft., and is surmounted by a statue representing the City of Paris, supported on the right and left by eight other statues personifying the principal cities to which the Northern line serves as a means of intercommunication \u2014 London, Vienna, Berlin, Cologne, Brus sels, St. Petersburg, Amsterdam, and Frankfort \u2014 all executed by sculptors of distinction. Moreover, several allegori cal figures, and a series of statues in honour of many of the towns on tho line, ornament other portions of the facade. The design of this gigantesque construc tion was due to the architectural skill of M. Hittorff, member of the Institute, aud of his talented son, the latter of whom was charged with the superintendence of the execution ofthe works. Notwithstanding its extensive proportions, the terminus has. alightand elegant appearance. Thecentre of the facade commands the boulevard in front of it, from which that portion of it is seen to advantage at a distance ; but the wings can only be contemplated at a few yards' distance on account of the proximity of the houses opposite. The general aspect of Paris never fails to secure the admiration of strangers. Considerably enlarged by the line of fortifications with which it has been surrounded, it extends on both banks of the Seine, over a length of eight miles ; circumference, twenty-two. This space is divided into twodistinct portions: first, that comprised within the old city wall, erected for the collection of the octroi or customs ; and secondly, the banliew, comprised between the old wall and the line of the new fortifications. The first part, which forms the twelve municipal arrondissements of Paris, is, in many parts, covered with splendid monuments, magnificent hotels and gardens. The houses are generally lofty and built in uniform style. The new streets are wide,"], [123, "85 straight, well paved, and lighted with gas and by electricity, but many of the old streets are narrow and crooked. The Seine, as observed, traverses Paris from east to west, and within the limits of the city it is crossed by twenty-three bridges and receives the small stream of Bievre or the Gobelins, and the canal of St. Martin, whicli joins those of the Ourcq and St. Denis. It here forms two islands, the Be St. Louis and the Be de la Cite, on which last the cathedral of Notre is situated, the Hotel Dieu, the Palace of Justice, &c. The portion of the capi tal seated on the right bank of the river is the most extensive, and contains the greatest number of public offices ; the centre is occupied by the Bourse or Ex change. In this quarter are the Louvre, ruins of the Tuileries, the Elyst'e Napo leon, Hotel de Ville (rebuilding), the National Opera House, Madeleine, &c. Its principal streets and squares are the place de la Concords-, place de l'Opera, rue de l'Opera, place Vendome, rue de Rivoli, rue de la Paix, rue Castiglione. Most of these are in the centre or west of Paris. The chief objects in the east are the Halle au Bid, Fontaine des Innocens, and the column of July. The finest and most fashionable promenades are the boulevards and the Champs Elysees, at the west end of whicli is the triumphal arch of l'Etoile and the Bois de Boulogne, at the other end the place du Carrousel and garden of the Tuileries ; and in the east, the cemetery of Pere la Chaise. The left bank of the river con tains tho Fauborg St. Germain, the principal residence of the old noblesse. On this side is the Pays Latin, the seat of the principal educational establish ments, as the Sorbonne, College of France, and Colleges of St. Louis, Louis le G rand, Henry the Fou rth, Polytechnic School, Normal School, School of Medi cine, and Schools of Law. The principal public buildings on this side are the Luxembourg Palace, Palace of the Fine Arts, the Oduon, Palace of the Legislation, Palace of the Institute, the Mint, tbe Pantheon, Hotel des Invalides, Military School, Jardin des plantes, and the Gobelins. This quarter also contains the greatest number of hospitals, the largest of which is the Salpetriere. Here are also the ruins of the Palace des Thermes, Hotel Cluny, the abattoirs of Grenelle and Villejuif, and the Artesian well. The space contained between the city walls and the fortified circle is composed of tho communes of the banlieue, compris ing, on the right bank, Bercy, Charonne, Belleville, La Villette, La Chapelle, Montmartre, Les Batignolles, Passy, and Auteuil; and on the left bank, Grenelle, Vaugirard, Montrouge, and Gentilly. The approach to the new walls is defended by thirteen detached forts, viz., Romainville, Noisy, Rosny, Nogent, Charenton, and the Castle of Vincennes, on the e___i ; Bicetre, Montrouge, Van vres, Issy, on the south ; on the west, Mont Valerien ; and on the north,.

PICQUIGNX.\u2014 A small commune of the department of La Somme, and situated on the leit bank of the river Somme. At this place a treaty was signed between Edward IV. and Louis XL, who met for the purpose on the bridge which crosses tbe river (1475). William of Normandy, surnamed Longs wood, was assassinated at this place. Estimated population : 2,000. RUE. \u2014 A small town and commune in the department of the Somme. lt is"], [124, "86 ordinary place of sepulture of the royal family of France and of other illustrious personages. By decree of the Con vention in 1793 the royal tombs were destroyed, and the valuable relics and other treasures of the Abbey, including the crown and sword of Charlemagne, the sword of Joan of Arc, the great cross, (fee, carried away. The buildings of the Abbey are now used as an estab lishment for the education of daughters of the members of the Legion of Honour. The exterior of St. Denis is much sur passed by that of Notre Dame, Rheims, and Amiens. Restorations have been going on here for many centuries, at different epochs and under several dynasties. The crypt, whicli contains the tombs of the kings of France, is quite a museum of sculpture. The interior perhaps exceeds that of Notre Dame. The style of the architecture is a kind of Lombard-Gothic. Felibien, in his \" Lives of Celebrated Architects,'' says that Abbot Suger ought to be considered as one of the most intelli gent men who lived in the twelfth century. He repaired and enlarged St. Denis, took upon himself the principal share of the work ; began it towards the year 1140, and finished it in less than ten years with an extraordinary magnificence, as may be learned from his own description. Some of the side chapels, the shrines of the ancient kings of France, are very splendid, from the rich colours that cover the walls, from the sparkling dyes of the windows, the golden ribs and bosses of the groining which is starred on a blue ground. It is unquestionably one of \" sights\" of France. At St. Denis are the principal locomotive works of the Northern of France Railway, which covers an im mense extent of ground. Estimated population : 10,000. remarkable for the number of its chapels, at which many miracles are said to have been performed. The river Maye flows through the commune, and discharges itself into the sea a short distance from the town. The battle-field of Cr^cy \u2014 \u25a0 one of the most memorable engagements recorded in French and English history (1460) \u2014 -is reached from this place, although tourists, as a rule, more generally patronise the diligence route from Abbeville. Estimated population : 2,000. ST. DENIS.\u2014 A small town of the department ofthe Seine, fourmiles north, of Paris. It is situated in a fertile plain on the Crou, near the right bank of the Seine, and of the canal of the same name, which connects the canal of Ourcq with the Seine. It is well built, and has handsome barracks, an asylum for the houseless poor, a small theatre, a public library ; it has also several bleacheries, cotton-spinning mills, tanneries, corn mills, <fec. ; and an active trade in flour, wine, vinegar, wood, and wool. Fairs are held four times a year. The origin of one of these \u2014 distinguished by the name of Londit \u2014 is dated as far back as the seventh century. It is one of the most important sheep fairs in France, the average sale of sheep exceeding annually 100,000. St. Denis was originally a small village, named Cato lacum. A chapel, which was erected here in tho third century over the tomb of St. Denis the Martyr, became the nucleus of the subsequent church. The present magnificent cathedral and royal mausoleum is one of the crowning glories of France, and has rendered the name of St. Denis renowned the world. The cathedral was originally founded in the twelfth or thirteenth century by King Dagobert, in connec tion with tbe celebrated Benedictine Abbey of St. Denis, and formed the"], [125, "87 PRINCIPAL PLACES ON THE THROUGH ROUTES TO BRUSSELS (via CALAIS AND via OSTEND). ALOST.\u2014 A Belgian town of the province of East Flanders, near the con fines of S. Brabant, 15 m. W.N.W. Brus sels, and 3 m. S. the Audegem station of the Ostende and Brussels Railway. It is surrounded with walls, which have five gates, and is traversed by the Dender, which has been converted into a canal, from Alost to its junction with the Scheldt at Termonde or Dendermonde, 8 m. below. The finest building in the town is the church of St. Martin, said to be by the architect of the cathedral of Amiens. It is either unfinished, or has been partially destroyed ; but the part existing forms one of the largest and finest churches in Belgium, and is adorned by a celebrated picture by Rubens \u2014 St.Roch beseeching our Saviour to stay the plague of Alost. Within the church is the mausoleum of Thierry Martens, a native of the town, who in troduced the art of printing into Belgium, a.d. 1475. The inscription states, with some ambiguity, and without much re gard to accuracy, that he was the first printer of Germany, France, and the Netherlands. The only other buildings worthy of notice are the townhouse, which was founded a.d. 1200, and has been recently rebuilt ; and the college, which is a handsome structure. The chief public institutions besides the col lege, are the hospital, the academy of design, the chamber of commerce, and the horticultural society. Both the trade and manufactures of Alost are of con siderable importance. The former is in corn, oil, and particularly hops, which are extensively grown in the neighbour hood. The latter are chiefly lace, cotton goods, hats, leather, glue, chicory, tobacco, and the various products of numerous breweries, distilleries, salt refineries, flax and cotton mills, bleachfields, printfields, dyeworks, copper and iron foundries. Alost, of which the earliest mention in charters is a.d. 870, was anciently the capital of what was called imperial Flanders. The French, under Turenne, took it in 16C7, but were obliged to abandon it after their sienal defeat by Marlborough, at Ramilies, in 1706. Several Roman coins have been found in the neighbourhood. Estimated popu lation: 20,000. Principal hotel: Do Flandre. BRUGES.\u2014 A Belgian city, and the capital of the province of West TElanders. It is surrounded with a double water line, whicli include the canals of Ostend (which traverses the city, and is of great depth), Ghent and the the Damme or Sluice (Ecluse), all of which here conjoin. The city has 54 bridges\u2014 42 stone and I? wooden \u2014 all opening in the middlefor the passage of vessels ; is of an oval shape, lying S.W. to N.E., and is fully 4 m. in circuit. It is surrounded by walls with seven gates, and has more than 200 streets. Many of these, owing to the great decrease of the population in modern times, seem half deserted ; but they have all a venerable look, and bear upon them a strong impress of the Middle Ages. The houses in the leading, and even in some of the retired streets, mostly remain as they were originally erected and in excellent preservation, with lofty fantastic gables and ornate fronts, abounding in quaint designs. Bruges is the seat of a bishop, the seat of assize courts for the province, and was long one of the finest cities of Europe. Near the Grand Place, or chief square, stands the old edifice called Halles (cloth and other halls, or markets), a square building, surmounted by a tower. 354 ft. high, in which is a very numerous and sweetly- toned set of chimes. The precise date of this edifice is unknown. Burnt in 1280, and again in 1493, it was exten sively repaired, if not quite rebuilt, in 1502. A watch has been kept in it for more than three centuries, tr ,,ve the alarm the moment a fire appt in the"], [126, "88 city or environs. To the E. of the market-place stands the Hotel de Ville, and a small but beautiful Gothic town house, containing several quaint pic tures. Adjoining it is the town library, of about 8,000 vols., and 500 to 000 MSS., most of which belonged to the old abbey of Dunes. Abutting on the town house is the chapel of St. Basil, composed of two distinct chapels \u2014 an upper and a lower ; the front being a kind of screen of florid Gothic. Contiguous to this double \u25a0chapel is the Government-house and the court-house. The old parts of the latter contain rooms once inhabited bythe sove reign Counts of Flanders, and Dukes of Burgundy. Bruges Cathedral is of un gainly exterior but imposing interior, rich in pictures, monuments and brasses, and choir stalls embossed with the escutcheons of the early knights of the Golden Fleece, an order which, founded in Bruges in 1429, by Philip of Burguudy, dates from the thirteenth century. The adjacent \u25a0Church of Notre Dame, dating from the same period, contains the sumptuous marble tombs of Charles the Bold and Mary of Burgundy, many pictures, and the exquisitely wrought statue of tho Virgin and Child, attributed to Michael Angelo. Facing the west side of the church is the Hospital of St. John. Then there is the Eglise de Jerusalem, with its imitations ot the Holy Sepulchre, to which a devout burgomaster made two pilgrimagea to ensure the resemblance ; there is the Chapelle du Saint Sang, where the \"Holy Blood,\" said to have been brought from the Holy Land by Count Theodoric of Flanders, is shown each Friday morning ; there i3 the Palais de Justice, with its remarkable Renaissance fire-place, executed in honour of Charles V. ; and in the Grande Place there is the striking Hotel de Ville, begun in 1377 ; the medi\u00e6val house called au Lion de Flandre, in which Charles II. of England, who was made \" King of the Guild of Archers,\" is said to have passed part of his exile ; and there too in the market place stands the well-known Belfry. Estimated population : 50,000. Principal Hotels: De Commerce; De Flandre. BRUSSELS.\u2014 The capital of the Belgian Kingdom and province of South Brabant is on the backs of the River branches, one of which passes b}' tho old market-place, and the other crosses the garden of tho Chartreux. It forms four islands in tho interior of tho town, the two principal of which are called Saint-Gery and Bon Secours, and is frequently styled \" Paris in miniature.\" The greatest length of Brussels from north-north-east to south-south-west is about one mile and a half, and its greatest breadth about a mile and a quarter. The town is partly built on the side of a hill, and is enclosed by a wall, which has eight gates ; the shape of the city is not unlike a flat iron. In side the wall is a wide boulevard planted with fine trees, which is divided into an upper and a lower town. The upper town is on the eastern side ; it is also the newest and most fashionable quarter. Here are the King's palace, the legisla tive chambers, aud public offices, se parated from the palace by the park, in the north-eastern angle of which is a theatre. In the upper town also are all the principal hotels and the residences of foreign ambassadors and ministers. The features of the lower town are its well-built streets, which contain many fine old buildings. It has splendid churches and several handsome squares surrounded by noble mansions, some of them unrivalled specimens of Gothic civil architecture. An entirely new quarter, called the Quartier Leopold, has i cceutly sprung up to tho east of the town. French is the prevailing lan guage of Brussels, but English is very generally spoken ; Flemish is also spoken by many of the lower orders. Brussels, besides being one of the best built cities in Europe, is considered a very pleasant and healthy place of residence. The Cathedral (Church of St. Gudule), the choir and transepts of whicli are of the 13th century, tho nave and towers of the 14th, and other portions of the 15th, 16th, and 17th, is rich in old stained glass and monuments. The carved wooden pulpit by Verbriiggen (1699) re presents the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Paradise. The museum is open daily from 10 to 3 (free), and contains 375 pictures of first-class masters. The Palace of Industry is a permanent ex hibition of inventions and manufactures. The Burgundian Library, open daily from 10 to 3 (free), contains more than Serme, which enters the city by two"], [127, "89 20,000 MSS. of great interest and value. The Palais de Justice contains two re markable historical paintings by Gaillait and E. de Biefve. In the Porte de Hal (a remnant of the old fortifications), there is an interesting collection of arms and armour. The Hotel de Ville, with its elegant tower, 364 feet high, was built 1442-1450. In the rear of this building is the curious \" mannikin \" statue and fountain. Among the other objects of interest are the King's Palace, the Ducal Palace, the Palais de la Nation, the vestibule of which is adorned with modern statues, the church of Notre-Dame de la Chapelle, with its mu ral paintings by Van Eyckerr, the tomb of Peter Breughel, etc. ; the Martyrs' Monument to the memory of tho Bel gians who fell in September, 1830, in the war with the Dutch ; the boulevards, the Botanical and Zoological Gardens ; the Wierz Museum, a collection of curious paintings by the artist Wierz, open daily from 10 to 3 (free) ; the Central, with its fountains, the Wood of Glambrois, Forest of Soignies, etc., etc. Visitors to the battle-field of Waterloo should take the railway from the southern station to Braine l'Alleud (8 miles). Estimated Population : within the walls 175,000 ; with the suburbs, about 380,000. Principal Hotels : Grand Hotel de Brussels ; Grand Hotel Bri tannique; De I'Europe ; De France ; and Du Grand Miroir. Bruges Canal. The town is, on the whole, well built. In some of the older parts, where many of tbe houses have gable fronts which rise tier above tier, and present a very fantastic appearance, the streets are often dark, and so narrow that two carriages can scarcely pass ; but in the other quarters the streets are in general straight and spacious, with rows, of handsome houses, fronting canals enclosed by magnificent quays. There are a great number of squares, among which the most deserving of notice are the Marche1 du Vendredi, where the weekly market is held, and where, in early times, the Counts of Flanders were inaugurated, and the trades unions used to rendezvous ; the Canter, or parade, planted with lime-trees, and surrounded by elegant edifices ; the Plain de St. Pierre, a large space, used especially for reviews and military exercises ; the Cora Market, near the centre of the town ; the Place de St. Pharailde, where the gate of the castle of the Counts of Flanders still stands ; and the Plaine des Recollets, remarkable for the number of its fino mansions and hotels. Before leaving the squares it may be proper to mention, that near the Marche du Vendredi there is an enormous cannon, 18 feet long, 10 feet in circuit, and nearly 3 feet wide at its mouth, evidently a prototype or twin sister of the famous Mons Meg, now in Edinburgh Castle, formed, like her, of circles and bars of iron, and surnamed Dulle Griete, equivalent in Flemish to Mad Margaret. The cathedral church of St. Bavon, the crypt of which was conse crated in 941, is the glory of Ghent ; the whole of the interior is lined with black marble, relieved at intervals with grace ful scrolls and white monuments of Parian purity and delicacy. There are twenty-four chapels within the walls ; the altars are alternately composed of gold, silver, and marble ; the rarest paintings and the most elaborate sculp ture teem upon all sides. One of the chapels contains a picture of European fame, \" The Adoration of the Lamb,\" by the brothers Van Eyck. The wings are wanting ; two are in the Brussels Gallery, and others in the Gallery of Berlin. The church of St. Michael's contains a once -celebrated \"Crucifixion,\" by Vandyck, spoilt by the restorers. St. Nicholas and the other churches are CALAIS. (See Paris route\u2014 page 82.) GHENT(or Gand).\u2014 A Belgian city, the capital of the province of East Flan ders, situated on a fertile plain at the con fluence of th e Lys with the Scheldt. The Ternenzen Canal communicates with the sea, and admits vessels drawing fifteen feet of water. It occupies a triangular space above eight miles in circuit, is sur rounded by walls, defended by a strong citadel, and entered by seven gates. In the interior the most striking feature iB the great number of canals, which branch off from the Lys in all directions, and forming a kind of network within the town, divide it into twenty-six islands, communicating with each other by forty-two large and forty-six small bridges. Another striking feature is the number of fine promenades, of which the most remarkable is the Coupure, formed by rows of trees along the"], [128, "90 all interesting for their art treasures. Near the Cathedral is the Belfry, 386 feet in height, and surmounted by a huge gill dragon brought from St. Sophia, at Constantinople, in 1204, by Count Bald win IX. The mechanism of the chimes can be examined in the tower, the view from which embraces half Flanders. Population: about 130,000. Principal Hotels : De la Poste ; Royal ; and De Vienne. of the Dukes of Burgundy. It was built by Jean-sans-Peur, 1430, and inhabited by the Emperor Charles V. It. is a quaint rather than a handsome edifice, in the late Gothic style ; but it has a prettily groined staircase in one of its tourelles, and a chapel built by Phillipe le Bel and painted by Arnold de Vuez. One division of the building, appropriated to a schi ol of art, contains a most interesting and valuable collection of drawing* by old masters, formed by the late M. Wicar, including 86 by Raphael (sketches for the School of Athens, various Madonnas, La Perla, (fee), 197 by Michael Angelo (chiefly architectui al \u2014 the cupola of St. Peter's, Prometheus, Last Judgment), 10 by Fra Bartolomeo, 15 by Francia, 5 by L. da Vinci, (fee, (fee., well worthy the inspection of all who take an interest in art. This interesting building now comprises the chief municipal offices ; the public library and museums, several churches with fine paintings, the Protestant church, synagogue, and prefecture; fine large hospitals, several extensive barracks, the prisons, exchange, mint, theatre, concert-ball, and large corn storehouses; and among its public esta blishments are, a valuable picture gallery, Academies of music and architecture, and a botanic garden. The canal on which Lille is built has several branches navi gable by small vessels, aud along one part of it, called the Middle Deule, is a tine esplanade, close to which Ls the handsome Pont Royal. The city de rives great importance from being on-i of the chief seats of the French thread and cotton manufactures. Calicoes, cotton handkerchiefs, printed goods, table linen, fine linen, cloths, thread, lace, stockings, and gloves, are its principal articles of commerce ; in cotton-spinning it also rivah some of the towns in Lancashire. It has also considerable manufactories of broad cloths, kerseymeres, serges, and other worsted stuffs ; velvets, hats, paper, beet root sugar, and mineral acids, with government tobacco and gunpowder manufactories, and an extensive fabrica tion of gold coin. The vicinity of the city is studded with bleaching-grounds, rape seed oil-mills, and beet-root plantations, the two latter of which are very impor tant, employing many hundreds of the inhabitants. A railway connects Lille HAL. \u2014 A small Belgian town of the province of Brabant, 30 miles S.S.W. from Brussels. It contains a beautiful Gothic church, dedicated to Sainte-Marie, and celebrated for its so-called miraculous image of the Virgin. The grand altar in this church, constructed of white marble, surmounted by a gorgeous taber nacle, and ornamented with beautiful sculptured bas-reliefs, the whole crowned by a fLure of the pelican \u2014 a medi\u00e6val symbol of Christ \u2014 is said to be uneqalled even in Belgium. In the baptistry the font of i orgeous brass is placed under a spire, adorned with statues and groups in high relief. The church was formerly dedicated to St. Martin. A statue was erected here in 1871 to the memory of Servais, the violoncellist, on the principal place of the town. Population: about 8,000. Principal Hotels: Des Pays Bas, Luc de Brabant. HAZEBROUCK.\u2014 A small town, commune, and military station of the Departement du Nord, in France. It is situated on the river Beurre, and has an ancient church wi h a lusty spire, a com munal college, and public library ; also manufactories of linen, yarn and cloth. Hazebrouck is the point of junction with the Dunkirk railway. Estimated population: 5,000. LILLE. \u2014 A strongly fortified and manufacturing city, the capital of the Departement du Nord, on the Deule, a canal connecting the Scarpe and Lys rivers, 26 miles N.N.E. of Arras, in France. It is entered by seven gates, and has a strong citadel, with barracks and magazines on its N.W. side ; it is pretty v ell laid out, having many straight aud wide streets lined with substantial brick houses, a Grande I lace of noble extent, and about twenty other squares ; but the quarters inhabited by the manu facturirg population are narrow. The Hotel de Ville was anciently the palace"], [129, "91 with Brussels and Ghent, through Cour trai, Roubaix, and Turcoing, all indus trial towns of importance. Lille, which successively belonged to the counts of Flanders, kings of France, and earls of Burgundy, was finally annexed to the crown of France by Louis XIV. in 1667. It was taken, after a three mouths' siege, by the allies under the Duke of Marl borough and Prince Eugene in 1708, and was bombarded by tne Austrians in 1792. The Porte de Paris entrance to the city is by a sort of triumphal arch, sur mounted by a frontispiece in the fashion of a screen propped up behind, filled with the trophies of the glory of Louis XIV. ; erected 1682. It is impossible to enter Lille without being struck by the impos ing character of its fortifications. To penetrate into the city, it is necessary to traverse its formidable lines of defence, ramparts, bridges, and moats. This was a chef-d'oeuvre of the famous engineer Vauban. In the centre of the Grande Palace stands a column erected in 1844, and commemorative of the citizens who died while defending their native city against the Austrians in 1792. The Musee is one of the finest in France, and contains a rich collection of paintings by the Flemish, Italian, andSpanishmasters. The terminus at Lille is in the Faubourg de Fives. Estimated population : nearly 70,000. Principal Hotels: Du Commerce; De I'Europe ; and De France. O STEND.\u2014 A Belgian seaport town, and mail packet station on the North Sea. It is strongly and regularly fortified ; being one of the line of fortresses in tended to defend tbe Belgian frontier on the side of France. Its situation, on a low sanay coast, where no trees will grow, is by no means agreeable ; though it is said to have a pure, healthy air, and is much resorted to for sea bathing. It is entered by four gates, and is, on the whole, well built. The public buildings, none of which deserve particular notice are theHotel de Ville, three churches (one Protestant), a prison, a civil and a mili- tary hospital, barracks and an arsenal. There are several promenades ; but the most agreeable, from lying open to the breeze, is the Digue, a sea wall, about half a mile long, and paved with bricks. The harbour is not easy of access, but the basin within is extensive, and forms the termination of a magnificent line of canals, stretching like net-work into the interior, and furnishing admirable facili ties for commerce. The sluices of Sy kens, opening from the canal into the harbour, are particularly admirable, and the canal itself, as far as Ghent, has a depth sufficient to float vessels of 600 tons. The manufactures of Ostend are unimportant, but include linen goods and sail-cloth, lace, oil, soap, hats,tobacco, (fee. There are also building docks and several other industrial establishments. Cod and herring fishing are carried on to a considerable extent, aud an important branch of trade is oysters, brought from the English coast, fattened here in large salt reservoirs, and transported as far as Paris, under the name of huitres d'Os tende. Ostend possesses a school of navigation, an academy of design and architecture, several primary schools, a theatre, a public garden beyond the walls, a mont-de-piete, and several other bene volent institutions. It was founded in the 9th century, walled in 1445, and regularly fortified in 1585, by the Prince of Orange. In the great struggle in which the States-General threw off the yoke of Spain, it sustained a memorable siege from 1601 to 1604, during which the besieged lost about 50,000, and the Spanish besiegers more than 80,000 men. Ultimately, when reduced to a mere heap of ruins, it obtained an honourable capitulation. In 1826, a great part of the town was destroyed by the explosion of a powder magazine. Ostend is con nected with England by submarine electric telegraph. Estimated population: 18,000. Principal Hotels: Du Grand Cafe ; Grand Marion ; Great Ocean ; Mer tian ; Du Littoral ; and Royal de Prusse. ST. OMER.\u2014 A large town and third-rate fortress of the Departement of Pas de Calais, in France. It is a picturesque town situated on the river Aa, at the mouth of the canal of Neuf- Foss^e. It is surrounded by irregular fortifications, and is defended by Fort Notre Dame. The town has a tribunal de commerce, a communal college, a public library of 20,000 volumes, a cathedral of the fourteenth century, with the tomb of its founder, St. Omer, and manufactories of coarse woollens, pipes, and paper. St. Omer was taken by Louis the Fourteenth in 1677. During the first revolution it was called"], [130, "92 i Morin la Montagne. St. Omer is a fortress, whose means of defence lie less in its actual fortifications than in the marshes which surround it, and the facility afforded by the river Aa, on which it stands, of flooding the land round about, so as to leave only a quarter of its circuit unprotected by the waters. There are, however, two ecclesiastical edifices worthy of notice, and we extract the following particulars fromMurrat/'s valuable handbook: \u2014 \"The Cathedral, at the upper end of the Rue St. Bertin, is a fine building, showing the transition from the round to the pointed style. The east end is a good example of the polygonal termination of churches with projecting chapels so common on the Continent. The interior is good; the small lady chapel has modern decorations. At the opposite oxtremity of the same street stand the scanty remains of the famous Abbey Church of St. Bertin, at one time the noblest Gothic monument of French Flanders \u2014 in its present state a disgrace to the town and a reproach to the Government ; for be it known that its destruction has been perpetrated since 1830. At the outbreak of the groat Revolution the monastery was sup pressed ; the Convention spared it ; and though under the Directory it was sold for the materials, unroofed, and stripped of itB woodwork and metal, yet its walls remained comparatively uninjured until the magistrates barbarously pulled it down to afford employment to some labourers out of work. The fragment remaining consists of a stately tower built in tbe 15th century (1431\u20141461), displaying the ornaments of the florid Gothic in the mutilated panelling on its walls and bits of tracery in its window ; a small portion of the nave remains attached to it. The tower, threatening to fall, has been propped by an ugly, ill-contrived buttress of masonry ; thero is some talk of converting it into a museum.
