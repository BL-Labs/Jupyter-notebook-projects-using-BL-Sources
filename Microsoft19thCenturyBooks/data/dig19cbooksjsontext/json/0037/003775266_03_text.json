CHAPTER I. PATERNAL DIPLOMACY. ' What ! ' roared Mr. Scratchell, scarlet of visage, ' you are asked to marry a man with fifteen thousand a year, and you refuse ? Did anybody ever hear of such lunacy ? ' BeUa sat shivering at the paternal wrath. Mrs. ScratcheU was weeping dumbly. AU the younger ScratcheUs were ready to lift up their voices in a chorus of condemnation. Bella's folly in refusing Mr. Piper was, in their eyes, a personal injury. 'You would not ask me to marry a man I cannot love, would you, father ? ' faltered Bella ; ' a man I can hardly respect.' VOL. III. -B"], [10, "2 AN OPEN VERDICT. ' You cannot respect fifteen thousand a year?' cried Mr. ScratcheU. ' Then, in the name of aU that's rea sonable, Avhat can you respect ? ' ' He is so rough-mannered and dictatorial,' urged BeUa, ' so stout and puffy. And it is really dreadful to hear him murder the Queen's English.' Mr. ScratcheU looked round at his assembled famUy with a wrathful glare, as if he were caUing upon them all to behold this ridiculous daughter of his. ' That ever I shoidd have bred and reared such foolishness ! ' he exclaimed. ' What's that fairy tale you were reading the little ones, mother, about the Princess and the seven feather beds ? She had seven feather beds to sleep upon, one atop of the other, and couldn't rest because there was a parched pea under the bottom one. There's your proud Princess for you !

If I loved Mr. Piper, or felt that I could teach myself to love him, I shouldn't care how badly he talked. But I cannot love him.' ' Who asks you to love him ? ' cried Mr. ScratcheU, folding and unfolding his newspaper violently, in a whirlwind of indignation. ' Nobody has made men tion of love \u2014 not Piper himself, I warrant. He's too sensible a man. You are only asked to marry him, and to do your duty in that state of life to which it has pleased God to caU you. And very grateful you ought to be for having been caUed to fifteen thousand a year. Think what you can do for your brothers and sisters, and your poor harassed mother ! There's a privUege for you. And if Piper should take to buying property hereabouts, and give me the collec tion of his rents, there'd be a lift for me.' Then Mrs. Scratchell feebly, and with numerous gasps and choking sobs, uplifted her maternal voice, and made her moan.

If there was anything better or brighter before her \u2014 any chance of her getting a young good-looking husband able to support her comfortably \u2014 I wouldn't say marry Mr. Piper. But I'm sure I can't see how any girl is to get weU married in Little Yafford, where the young men ' ' Haven't one sixpence to rub against another,' interrupted Mr. Scratchell, impatiently. ' And I know what Use is for those that have to study the outlay of every penny, and to keep their brains always on the rack in order just barely to pay their way,' continued Mrs. ScratcheU. BeUa gave a deep, despondent sigh. It was aU true that these worldly-minded parents Avere saying. She was no romantic girl to beUeve in an impossible future.

Mr. ScratcheU heard that long sigh and guessed its meaning. He checked his loud indignation, aU of a sudden, and had recourse to diplomacy. The girl's own sense was beginning to argue against her foolishness. 'WeU, my dear,' he said, quite amiably, 'if you've made up your mind there's no use in our saying any more about it.

'You'll have to wait till Mr. Piper asks you again,' replied her father, delighted at having gained his point, but too diplomatic to show his satis faction. 'You've refused him once.

' Oh, my darhng, it would be the making of us all,' she exclaimed. 'I don't see what good that would be to me, mother, if I was miserable,' Bella responded, sulkily. ' But you couldn't be miserable in such a home as Yafford Park, and with such a good man as Mr. Piper. It isn't as if you had ever cared for anybody else, dear.' ' No, of course not,' said BeUa, full of bitterness. ' That makes a difference.' ' And think what a lady you would be, and how high you could hold your head.' ' Yes, I would hold my head high enough, mother. You may be sure of that. I would have something out of life. Beatrix Harefield should see what use I could make of money.' ' Of course, dear.

Little Yafford was hardly worth leading ; but Bella was of the temper that deems it better to reign in a village than to serve in Borne. She put on her bonnet and went to caU upon Mrs. Dulcimer. That lady was in the garden, her complexion protected by a muslin sun-bonnet, washing the green flies off her roses. To her sympathetic ear BeUa imparted the story of Mr. Piper's wooing and the paternal wrath. ' My dear, I don't wonder that your father was angry,' cried the Vicar's wife. ' Why, Mr. Piper is the very man for you. The idea occurred to me soon after Mrs. Piper's death. But I didn't mention it, for fear of alarming your delicacy.

What a chance you would have lost if you had married him ! ' BeUa shuddered. ' Yes, it woidd have been a pity,' she said.

I shall call and see those dear children of his to morrow. And when he asks you again, you will give him a kinder answer ? ' ' Yes,' said Bella, with a long-drawn sigh,' since everybody thinks it would be best.' Everybody did not include Beatrix Harefield. Bella had not consulted \u2014 nor did she mean to con sult \u2014 her old friend and playfeUow. She knew quite Avell that Beatrix would have advised her against a mercenary marriage, and in spite of all her sighs and hesitations, Bella's sordid little soul languished for the possession of Mr. Piper's wealth."], [21, "PATERNAL DIPLOMACY. 13 Mrs. Dulcimer was dehghted at the notion of conducting a new courtship to a triumphant issue. She put on her best bonnet early in the afternoon, and went to pay her visit to the Park, feeling that it behoved her to bring matters to a crisis. Mr. Piper was at home, seated on a garden chair on his weU-kept lawn, basking in the sunshine, after a heavy dinner which went by the name of luncheon. He had a sleek, weU-fed look at this stage of his existence, which did not encourage sentimental ideas : but Mrs. Dulcimer looked at the big white house with its Doric portico, the stone vases full of bright scarlet geraniums, the velvet lawn and gaudy flower beds, the beltof fine old timber, the deer-park across the ha-ha, and thought what a happy woman BeUa would be as the mistress of such a domain. She hardly gave one thought to poor Mr. Piper. He was only a something that went with the Park ; like a bit of out lying land, which nobody cares about, tacked on to a large estate. ' I hope your dear children are aU weU and strong,' said Mrs. Dulcimer, after she had shaken hands with Mr. Piper, and they had confided to"], [22, "14 AN OPEN VERDICT. each other their opinions about the weather. ' I came on purpose to see them.' ' You shall see them all presently, mum,' replied Mr. Piper. ' The schoolroom maid is cleaning 'em up a bit. They've been regular Turks aU this blessed morning. They've lost their gov'ness.' ' Why, how is that ? ' cried the hypocritical Mrs. Dulcimer. ' Bella is so fond of them. She is always talking of her clever little pupils.' ' She's left 'em to shift for themselves, for aU her fondness,' said Mr. Piper ; and then, being of a candid nature, he freely confided his trouble to the Vicar's Avife. He told her that he had asked Bella to marry him, and she had said no, and upon that they had parted. ' It was better for her to go,' he said. ' I couldn't abear the sight of her about the place under the circumstances. I should feel like the fox with the grapes. I should be always hardening my heart against her.' ' Dear, dear,' sighed Mrs. Dulcimer. ' I'm afraid you were too sudden. A woman is so sensitive about"], [23, "PATERNAL DIPLOMACY. 15 such matters. I dare say you took that poor chUd by surprise.' ' Well, mum, perhaps I may. I'd been thinking of making her an offer for a long time, but it may have come on her like a thunderclap.' \u25a0 >' Of course it did. And, being shy and sensitive, she naturaUy said no.' ' Don't you think she meant no ? ' asked Mr. Piper, swinging himself suddenly round in his garden chair, and looking very warm and eager. 'Indeed, I do not. She was with me yester day afternoon, and I thought her looking iU and unhappy. I felt sure there was something wrong. 'Now you look here, Mrs. Dulcimer,' said the widower. ' I'm not going to offer myself to that young woman a second time, for the sake of getting a second refusal ; but if you are sure she won't say no I don't mind giving her another chance. I'm not a proud man, but I've got a proper respect for myself, and I don't want to be humiliated. I shan't ask her again unless I'm very sure of my ground.'

But I'U come myself with pleasure, and if you Uke to ask Bella Scratchell I've no objec tion to meet her.' Mr. Piper's olive branches now appeared, newly washed and combed, and in their Sunday clothes. Thus attired they looked a little more vulgar than in their every-day garments. They were aU angles and sharp lines, and looked embarrassed by their finery, which, from the corkscrew curls at the top of their heads to the tight new shoes upon their afflicted feet, was more or less calculated to give them pain. NaturaUy Mrs. Dulcimer pretended to be en raptured with them. She discovered in one an extraordinary likeness to his papa, in another a striking \u2014 yes, a painfully striking resemblance to her poor dear mamma. She asked them questions"], [25, "PATERNAL DIPLOMACY. 17 about their studies and recreations, and having completely exhausted herself in less than ten minutes' performance of these civilities, she rose to wish Mr. Piper and his young famUy good-bye.

He hardly knew what he was eating, though he was a man Avho usuaUy considered his meals a serious part of life, and though Rebecca had surpassed herself in the preparation of a chicken salad. The evening was lovely, the sunset a study for Turner, and after tea Mrs. Dulcimer took Mr. Piper into the garden to show him her famous roses. Once there the worthy manufacturer was trapped. BeUa was in faithful attendance upon the"], [27, "19 MR. PIPER IS ACCEPTED. Vicar's wife, and presently Rebecca came, flushed and breathless, to say that her mistress was wanted; whereupon, with many apologies, Mrs. Dulcimer left Mr. Piper and Miss ScratcheU together. 'BeUa can show you the rest of the garden,' she said as she hurried off. ' Take me down by the gooseberry bushes, BeUa,' said Mr. Piper. ' It's shadier and more retired there.' And in that shady and retired spot, with the rugged old plum trees and pear trees on the crumbly red wall looking at them, and the happy snails taking their evening promenades under the thorny gooseberry bushes, and the luxuriant scarlet runners making a curtain between these two lovers and the outside world, Mr. Piper \u2014 in fewest and plainest words \u2014 repeated his offer, and this time was not refused. ' BeUa,' he exclaimed, with a little gush of emotion, putting his betrothed's smaU hand under his elephantine arm, ' I'll make you the happiest woman in the three Ridings. You shaU have every thing that heart can wish. Poor Maggie never could cotton to her position. My good fortune"], [28, "20 AN OPEN VERDICT. came too late for her. She had got into a groove when I was a struggling man, and in that groove she stuck. She tried hard to play the lady; but she couldn't manage it, poor soul. She was always the anxious hard-working housewife at bottom. There's no rubbing the spots out of the leopard's hide, or whitening the Ethiopian, you see, Bella. Now you were born a lady.' BeUa simpered and blushed. ' I shaU try not to disgrace your fortune,' she said, meekly. ' Disgrace it ! Why, you'U set it off by your prettiness and your nice little ways. I mean to get you into county society, Bella. I never tried it on with Mrs. P., for I felt she wasn't up to it; but I shaU take you slap in among the county folks.' Bella shuddered. The little she had seen and heard of county people led her to beUeve that they were very slow to open their doors to such men as Mr. Piper. ' Mrs. P. never had but one hoss and a broom,' said the widower, walking his chosen one briskly up and down behind the curtain of scarlet runners."], [29, "MR.

'You're right,' exclaimed Mr. Piper, 'a woman looks more queenly in a barouche. And you can have poor Mrs. P.'s brougham done up for night work. And you shaU have a chaise and the prettiest pair of ponies that can be bought for money, and then you can drive me about on fine afternoons.

' ' I dare say I could if I tried,' answered BeUa. ' Ah, I'U have you taught. You'U have a good deal to learn when you are Mrs. Piper, but you're young enough to take kindly to a change in your circumstances. Poor Moggie wasn't. Her mind was always in the bread-pan or the butcher's book.'"], [30, "22 AN OPEN VERDICT. In this practical manner were matters settled between Mr. Piper and his betrothed. The widower called upon Mr. ScratcheU next day, and obtained that gentleman's consent to his nuptials. The consent was granted with a certain air of reluctance which enhanced the favour. ' As far as my personal respect for you goes, there is no man Uving I'd sooner have for a son in-law,' said Mr. Scratchell, 'but you'U allow that there is a great disparity of age between you and my daughter.' Mr. Piper was quite willing to allow this. ' If I couldn't marry a pretty girl I wouldn't marry at aU,' he said. ' I don't want a housekeeper. I want some one bright and pleasant to look at when I come home to dinner. As for the dis parity, weU, I shan't forget that in the settlement I mean to make upon BeUa.' This was exactly what Mr. ScratcheU wanted. After this everything was speedily arranged. Mr. Piper was an impetuous man, and would brook no delay. He would like to have been married immediately, but he was persuaded, for"], [31, "MR. PIPER IS ACCEPTED. 23 decency's sake, to wait tiU October. Even this would be very soon after the late Mrs. Piper's death ; but the indulgent Mrs. Dulcimer argued that a man in Mr. Piper's forlorn position, with a young family running to seed in the custody of servants, might be excused if he hastened matters. So Bella set to work to prepare her trousseau which was by far the most interesting part of the business, especially after Mr. Piper had slipped a little bundle of bank-notes into her hand one evening at parting, which bundle was found to amount to five hundred pounds.

She had already begun to taste the sweets of wealth. Her betrothed showered gifts upon her, and positively overwhelmed Mrs. ScratcheU with garden stuff and farm produce.

Beatrix was horrified when she heard of her friend's engagement. 'Oh, BeUa, how could you?' she exclaimed. ' You are sacrificing yourseff for the sake of your famUy.' Bella blushed, for in her heart of hearts she kneAV that the interests of her family had been very far from her thoughts when she consented to become the second Mrs. Piper. ' My father and mother had set their hearts upon it,' she said. ' But they had no right to set their hearts upon your marrying such a man as that.' ' He is a very good man,' pleaded BeUa. ' Have you reaUy made up your mind to marry him ? Do you reaUy beUeve that you can Uve hap pily with him ? ' asked Beatrix, earnestly. ' Yes,' sighed Bella, thinking of the barouche and"], [33, "MR.

' And what about his children, Bella ? Are they nice ? Do you feel that you can love them ? ' BeUa involuntarily made a wry face. 'They are not very nice,' she answered, ' but it wUl be my duty to love them, and of course I shall do so.' This conversation took place at the Water House one afternoon at the beginning of October. Beatrix"], [34, "26 AN OPEN VERDICT. and her companion, Madame Leonard, had been away for nearly two months, living quietly at Whitby and other seaside places, and Beatrix had come back improved in health and spirits. Sir Kenrick had been absent six months, and Avas likely to return at the end of the year, unless the Avar continued. He would not care to leave the army while there was any hard fighting going on, and his regiment was in the thick of it. Mrs. Dul cimer loudly lamented this Burmese outbreak, which made it impossible for Kenrick to sell out with a good grace yet awhile. She was always talking to Beatrix about him, and entreating to hear little bits of his letters. Lately there had been an irregularity in the letters. Kenrick's regiment had been moving about. He had been off the track of civilization and postal facilities. One morning in October, just a week before Bella's wedding day, there came a startling letter \u2014 a letter which B eatrix brought to Mrs. Dulcimer. ' Oh, my dear, my dear !

Bella's marriage was to take place on the last day of October. It had been laid down from the begin ning that it was to be a very quiet wedding. There was a newness and brightness about that splendid monument to the late Mrs. Piper in Little Yafford churchyard which seemed to forbid high jinks at Mr. Piper's second nuptials. ' People might talk,' as Mrs. ScratcheU said, happily ignorant that people were talking about her daughter and Mr. Piper with aU their might already. Hardly anybody was to be invited to the wed ding. This was what Mr. Piper and everybody else concerned kept on saying ; yet every day some fresh invitation was given. Mr. Piper had a good many friends among the manufacturing classes, innumerable middle-aged men with red faces and expansive waist coats, every one of whom was, according to Mr."], [39, "A WEDDING MARCH. 31 Piper, the oldest friend he had. These, one by one, were bidden, with their wives and famUies, \u2014 ' the more the merrier.' In no case was the invitation pre meditated, but it came naturally from Mr. Piper's lips when he met an old acquaintance on 'Change, or in the club-house at Great Yafford. ' Never mind, my dear,' he said, apologetically, to Bella. ' They are aU carriage people. And they'll make a fine show at the church door.' ' But I thought we were going into county society,' said Bella. ' So we are, my pet, but we aren't going to cut old friends. There's Joe WigzeU, the joUiest fellow I know, and making twelve thousand a year out of hat linings. Mrs, WigzeU's a perfect lady, and there's a fine famUy of grown-up daughters. You ought to know the WigzeUs.' ' I think if you want to be in county society you'll have to give up your WigzeUs,' said Bella. ' They won't mix.' ' But they must mix,' cried Mr. Piper. ' I shall make it worth their whUe to mix. Such dinners as I shall give wUl bring the two classes together -'"], [40, "32 AN OPEN VERDICT, ' Like oil and vinegar,' said BeUa, who was a little out of humour with her affianced. These invitations of Mr. Piper's, given at random, had swelled the wedding party into an alarming number. Poor Mrs. Scratchell was troubled in mind as to how she should seat her guests. There was a difficulty about the tables. But Mr. Piper made light of everything. He would have no cutting and contriving, no humble devices of Mrs. Scratchell's, no home-made pastry. He went to Great Yafford and contracted with the principal confectioner of that town to supply everything, from the tables and decorations down to the salt spoons. The breakfast was to be a magnificent banquet, at a guinea a head, exclusive of wines, and Mr. Piper was to write a cheque for everything. This arrangement pleased everybody except Bella, whose pride was keenly wounded by it. 'You have made a pauper of me among you,' she cried angrUy, to the fami ly circle, on the night before her wedding. ' I had rather have had the quietest, simplest breakfast that mother could have arranged, with the Dulcimers and Beatrix Harefield for our"], [41, "A WEDDING MARCH. 33 only visitors, than aU this finery paid for by Mr. Piper.' ' Fiddlesticks ! ' exclaimed Mrs. Scratchell. ' You weren't ashamed to take his money for your wedding clothes. Why should you be ashamed of his pay ing for your wedding breakfast ? I hate such humbug.' ' I have a little pride left,' said Bella. ' Very Uttle, I should think,' answered her father, ' and what you have doesn't become you. It's like the peacock's feathers on the jackdaw. You weren't born with it.' ' Come upstairs and let us try on the wedding bonnets,' said Clementina. ' And be kind and nice, Bella. RecoUect it is your last night at home.' ' Thank God for that, at any rate,' ejaculated BeUa, piously. The house had been transformed by an artificial and almost awful tidiness. Everything had been put away. The swept and garnished rooms were scarcely habitable. ' I never saw such discomfort,' cried Mr. Scrat cheU, looking discontentedly round his office, which VOL. III.

Valuable leases and agreements might have been thrust into obscure corners where they would be forgotten. The whole process horrified him. ' You oughtn't to have touched my office,' he said, business is business.' ' I couldn't help it,' pleaded Mrs. Scratchell. ' The men from Great Yafford said we must have a room for the gentlemen to put their hats and things, so I was obliged to give them this. You have no idea how they order us about. And then they asked me where they were to put your things, and almost before I told them, and while I was so flurried I scarcely knew what I was saying, your papers and tin boxes were all swept off' ' And pray where are they ? ' demanded Mr. ScratcheU, furiously. 'I \u2014 don't be angry, Scratchell. I couldn't help it.

' It's for a short time, dear,' said Mrs. Scratchell, soothingly. ' We'll put everything back in its place the day after to-morrow ; and I don't think rats like parchment.' The wedding day dawned, and to all that busy and excited household the sky seemed to be of another colour, and the atmosphere of another quality than the oky and atmosphere of common days. The ScratcheU girls rose with the lark, or rather with the disappearance of the cockroaches in the old kitchen, where those black gentlemen scampered off to their holes, like Hamlet's ghost, at cockcrow. The younger sisters were in high spirits. The idea of an inordinately rich brother in-law opened a new hemisphere of delight.

To-day they Avere to wear handsome dresses for the first time in their lives ; dresses of Bella's providing. As bridesmaids they were important features in the"], [44, "36 AN OPEN VERDICT. show. The maid-of-all-work was no less excited. She, too, was to wear a fine dress; and she had the prospect of unlimited flirtation Avith the young men from the pastrycook's. She brought the girls an early cup of tea, and helped them to plait their hair. Ordinary plaits would not do for to-day. ' I'll have mine plaited in ten, if you can manage it, Sally,' said Flora. 'And I'll have mine in the Grecian plait,' said Clementina. ' I don't know what's the matter with Miss Beller,' said the faithful Sally. ' It's my belief she has been crying all night. Her eyes are as red as pickled cabbage. All I can say, if she isn't fond of Mr. Piper she ought to be. I never see such a free-spoken, open-handed gentleman.' Mr, Piper Avas intensely popular in the Scratchell household. Nobody considered that Bella was sacrificing herself in marrying so charming a man.

He had won everybody's favour, except perhaps that of bis young bride. At a quarter to eleven everybody was ready ; Mr. Scratchell in an entire neAV suit, which cir cumstance Avas such a novelty to him that he felt as if he had been changed in his sleep, like the tinker in the old story ; Mrs. ScratcheU, flushed and nervous, tightly encased in a shining purple silk gown, which made her presence felt as a mass of vivid colour wherever she appeared, like a new stained glass window in an old church. The bridesmaids looked bright and pretty in sky blue, with wreaths of forget-me-nots round their Avhite chip bonnets. The boys wore sleek broad cloth, like their father's, buff waistcoats and lavender trousers. Everything was intensely new. They all stood in the hall waiting for the bride, and contemplating each other curiously, like stran gers. ' I never thought father could have come out so good-looking,' whispered Clementina to her eldest brother. ' I should hardly have known him.'"], [46, "38 AN OPEN VERDICT. ' Ah ! ' ejaculated Herbert, ' money makes all the difference.' They felt as if they were all going to be rich now. It was not Bella only who went up in the social scale. Her family ascended with her. Even the faithful domestic drudge, Sally, rejoiced at the change in her fortunes. The fragments that fell to her share after the family dinner would be daintier and more plentiful. Her scanty wages Avould be more secure. At last Bella came down, in glistening white apparel, clouded over with lace. That delicate taste which had always been hers, the instinctive refinement in all external things which made her mother say that Bella had been a lady from her cradle, had regulated her wedding dress. She looked as pure and aerial as some pale spring floweret, tremulous upon its slender stem. Her famUy bowed down and worshipped her, like Joseph's brethren, as represented in the vision of the sheaves. 'God bless you, my pet!' cried her father, in an unprecedented burst of affection. ' It is some-"], [47, "39 A WEDDING MARCH. thing to have such a beauty as you in one's famUy.' The gray old chancel was like a bed of gaudy tulips, so varied and so brilliant were the dresses of Mr. Piper's manufacturing friends, waiting im patiently to behold him at the altar. Among all these bright colours and startling bonnets, Beatrix Harefield, in her gray silk dress and old Brussels lace, looked hke a creature belonging to another world. AU the manufacturing people noticed her, and wanted to know who that distinguished-look ing young lady was. Mrs. Dulcimer and Beatrix had the Vicarage pew aU to themselves. Presently the bride entered the porch, leaning on her father's arm, pale against the whiteness of her bridal dress. Mr. Piper, crimson with agita tion, and breathing a little harder than usual, hurried forward to receive her. He offered her his arm.

Dulcimer read the service beautifully, but Mr. Piper's manufacturing friends hardly appreciated the Vicar's deliberate and impressive style. They Avould rather have had the ceremony rattled over Avith modern celerity, so that they might get to the wedding breakfast. ' If there's any hot ontries they'll be spoiled,' Avhispered Mrs. Wigzell, the hat-lining manu facturer's wife, to Mrs. Porkman, whose husband was in the provision line. 'I'm beginning to feel quite faint,' answered Mrs. Porkman. ' Getting up so early and coming so far ! It's trying for a weak constitution.' 'Did you ever see such a young thing?' asked Mrs. Wigzell, indicating the bride with a motion of her head. Mrs. Porkman's only answer was a profound sigh. ' What can be expected from such an unsuit able marriage?' demanded Mrs. WigzeU, still in a whisper. 'After such a sensible wife as poor Moggie, too.' ' Oh, my dear, Moggie Piper never rose to the level of her position,' answered Mrs. Porkman."], [49, "41 A- WEDDING MARCH. And now all was over, and for ever and ever \u2014 or at least for the ever and ever of this lower world \u2014 Ebenezer Piper and Isabella ScratcheU were made one. Whatever the incongruity of the union, the thing was done. Disgrace or death only could loosen the knot. The organ crashed out the tremendous chords of the Wedding March, everybody looked delighted at the near prospect of breakfast. People crowded into the vestry to see Bella and her husband sign the register. There was much kissing of bride and bridesmaids, while poor Mrs. Scratchell, wedged into a corner by the vestry door, wept a shower of hot tears over her purple dress. ' I hope she'U be happy,' she ejaculated. ' Mar riage is' a solemn thing. God grant she may be happy.' And in her inmost heart the mother prayed and feared lest aU should not be well with her daughter in this marriage which she as well as her husband had striven so hard to bring to pass. ' We have done aU for the best,' she told her self, ' and Mr. Piper is a kind, good man.'"], [50, "42 AN OPEN VERDICT. Her maternal heart thrilled with pride presently at the church door when she saw the manufacturing people's carriages, the sleek well-groomed horses, the smart liveries, the consequential coachmen and pampered footmen. They were a long time getting away from the church, and there was a good deal of fuss, and some offence given to punctilious minds, in bringing the carriages to the porch. Mrs. Pork man's landau came before Mrs. Wigzell's, which was wrong, as everybody knows that hat linings rank before provisions ; and the great Mr. Timperley of the Linseed Mills \u2014 quite the most important person present \u2014 was left with his aggrieved wife and daughter till nearly the last. However, they aU got off ultimately, and five minutes brought them to Mr. Scratchell's door. The breakfast was laid on two long tables in the common parlour ; the best parlour did duty as a reception-room, and for the display of the wed ding presents, which were exhibited on a side table. Mr. Piper's friends had all sent offerings, scaly golden snakes with emerald or ruby eyes, mother o'-pearl envelope boxes, filigree bouquet holders,"], [51, "43 A WEDDING MARCH. lockets, fans, personal finery of all kinds. To the bride of a gentleman in Mr. Piper's firmly estab lished position, no one could think of offering the butter dishes and dessert knives, claret jugs and fish carvers, pickle bottles and biscuit boxes, which are presented to modest young couples just setting up in domestic business. Bella's presents were therefore all of a strictly useless character. Beatrix gave her a set of pearl ornaments, Mrs. Dulcimer a dressing-case. The Vicar's gift was a Bible in an exquisite antique binding, and a pocket edition of Shakespeare. 'You need never be at a loss for something worth reading while you have those two books, my dear,' he told Bella when he presented them. The breakfast Avas a success. The Great Yafford confectioner had done his duty. There were perigord pies, and barley sugar temples, hecatombs of poultry and game, highly decorated hams and tongues, trifles, jelUes, creams, hothouse fruit, ices, wafers, coffee and liqueurs. To the minds of the young Scratchells it was the most Avonderful feast. They played havoc among all the dishes, reckless"], [52, "44 AN OPEN VERDICT. of after-consequences. Such a banquet as that was Avell worth the cost of a bUious attack. The wines had been sent from the Park, and Avere the choicest in Mr. Piper's collection. ' There's a bookay about that 'ock,' said Mr. Porkman, smacking his lips approvingly, ' that I don't remember to have tasted for the last ten years. You don't get such 'ock now-a-days. Money won't buy it, no more than it won't buy Madeira.' ' I hope you'll crack many a bottle before the next ten years, Porkman,' roared Mr. Piper. ' It's Skloss Johnny's Berger that I bought out of old Tom Howland's cellar, after the poor old gentle man's death. He was a Connysewer, was Tom. I've got a Avhole bin, and it avUI be your fault if you don't punish it.' 'And so I will, sir, for it's real good stuff,' answered Mr. Porkman, blinking at the straw coloured Avine in his green glass. The neAvly-married couple were to spend their honeymoon in Italy. Coarse as he Avas in appear ance and manners, Mr. Piper had vague yearnings after the pleasures of refinement. He wanted to"], [53, "45 A WEDDING MARCH. see the cities of Italy, and the pictures and statues Avith which he had been informed those cities abounded. He had not cared to travel in the first Mrs. Piper's time, firstly because that lady's health had been precarious, and secondly because she could not speak a word of any language except her own. Mr. Piper wanted a companion who could interpret for him, and assist him to squabble with innkeepers and hackney coachmen. Such a companion he felt he could have in Bella, and he would take a pride in ex hibiting his pretty young wife at table-d'hotes and in public places. He would like to be pointed out as a comfortable well-to-do man of middle age who had married a girl young enough to be his daughter. He was not ashamed of the disparity. It flattered his vanity. Bella looked very pretty by and by in a fawn coloured travelling dress and a pale blue bonnet. There was a carriage and four to take Mr. Piper and his bride to the railway station at Great Yafford. He had insisted upc a four horses, though two could have done the work just as well. The postillions were an imposing spectacle \u2014 smartly clad in sky"], [54, "46 AN OPEN VERDICT. blue jackets, with satin favours pinned upon thei breasts, and slightly the Avorse for beer. Happily the hired horses were of a sober breed, or Mr. and Mrs. Piper might have come to grief on the first stage of their journey. They were gone \u2014 amidst the usual shower of old slippers. The wedding guests departed immediately after. There was to be no dance, nothing to wind up the evening, as Clementina and aU her younger sisters and brothers loudly lamented. ' I should think you'd better all go off to your beds, after the way you stuffed yourselves all through the breakfast,' said Mr. Scratchell. ' I saw you.' ' What Avas the use of leaving things ? ' demanded Herbert. ' The pastrycook's men will take every thing back. They won't leave us a crumb for to- morrow. Herbert was right. The confectioner's men were already sweeping off the fragments of the feast; \u2014 half-tongues \u2014bodies of fowls \u2014 dUapidated pies. Mrs. ScratcheU stood and watched them with regretful looks. The family might have subsisted for a week upon the savoury remains. The smaU ScratcheUs"], [55, "47 A WEDDING MARCH. prowled round the tables and picked Uttle bits out of the plates. Those manufacturing people had been delicate and wasteful in their eating. The broken bits were daintier than anything the little ScratcheUs had ever tasted before. 'Come, clear out,' cried the father, 'you've aU eaten too much already.' But he thought it a hard thing that the pastry cook's men should come down, like the locusts of Scripture, and make barrenness in the land, after Mr. Piper had paid for everything. The house had a desolate look when the van had driven off with all the glass and china and long deal tables, the epergnes and artificial floAvers. Bella's room looked unutterably dismal. It was but a poor attic, at best, and now, in the untidiness of de parture, strewed aU over with crumpled scraps of paper, ends of old ribbon, cast-off cuffs and collars, and worn-out shoes, looked horrible. The younger sisters explored the chamber after all was over, in the faint hope of gleaning something valuable.

' I'm not particularly ugly, and I've Bella's com plexion, which is the best part of her,' she said, ' but I don't suppose there's a Mr. Piper growing for me anywhere.'

In the dull dark days of November Mr. and Mrs. Dulcimer took their ward to Southampton, there to await her lover's return. They were to spend a week at Culverhouse AA7ith Sir Kenrick, and then he was to go Avith them when they went back to Little Yafford. Mrs. Dulcimer had planned it all. If Kenrick was ailing still \u2014 though that was not likely, Mrs. Dulci mer said, after the sea voyage \u2014 Rebecca could nurse him. There was no beef tea like Rebecca's, no such calves' foot jelly. They went to the Dolphin Hotel at Southampton, and Mr. Dulcimer at once descended upon the old book-shops in the High Street, like a vulture upon carrion \u2014 very much like a vulture, since he cared only for the dead. Mrs. Dulcimer took Beatrix for a gentle walk, which meant a contemplation of all VOL. III. E"], [58, "50 AN OPEN VERDICT. the shop windows. Beatrix looked pale and out of spirits. ' I know you are anxious about Kenrick,' said Mrs. Dulcimer. Beatrix blushed. Her conscience smote her for not being anxious enough about her wounded lover. Had it been Cyril thus returning, what agonies of hope and fear would have rent her breast ! But it was only Kenrick, the man she had promised, out of simple gratitude and esteem, to marry. Her feeling about him, as the hour of their meeting drew nigh, was an ever-increasing dread. The day came for the arrival of the steamer. The weather had been favourable, late as it was in the year, and the boat came [into the docks on the very day she was expected. Mrs. Dulcimer and Beatrix had been walking on the platform for an hour in the afternoon, when the Vicar came bustling up to them. 'The steamer is just coming in,' he cried, and they were all hurried off to the docks. There were a great many people, a . crowd of anxious faces aU looking towards the open water"], [59, "kenrick's return. 51 across Avhich the big steamer Avas cleaving her steady way. Who was that on the high bridge beside the captain, looking shoreward through a glass? 'Kenrick,' exclaimed Mr. and Mrs. Dulcimer simultaneously. Beatrix saw nothing. The docks and the people, the blue bright water outside, the muddy green water inside, the big gaUy painted steamer, swam before her eyes. He was coming. He was coming to claim the fulfilment of her promise. That weak moment in which she had yielded to an impulse of grateful feeUng now meant life-long misery. A few minutes more and he was standing by her side, her hand clasped in his, Mr. Dulcimer giving him hearty welcome, Mrs. Dulcimer in tears, Beatrix dumb as a statue. ' Oh, my poor dear Kenrick,' cried the Vicar's wife when she could find a voice. ' How changed you are \u2014 how fearfully changed ! ' ' I've been very ill,' he answered, quietly. ' I didn't want to frighten you aU, so I made rather light of it in my letter. But I've had a narrow"], [60, "52 AN OPEN VERDICT. escape. However, here I am, and I don't mean to knock under now.' The change was startling. The elegant and aris tocratic-looking young man, Avhom they had parted from less than a year ago, was transformed into a feeble invalid, whose shoulders were bent Avith Aveakness, and across whose cadaverous cheek there appeared the deep cicatrice of a sabre wound. There was nothing absolutely repulsive in Kenrick's aspect, but there was enough to make love itself falter. They got him into a fly and drove off to the Dolphin, while Mr. Dulcimer stayed behind to look after the luggage. ' Beatrix,' said Kenrick, when they were seated opposite each other in the fly, ' I have not heard your voice yet, and it is your voice that I have been hearing in my dreams every night on board the steamer.' ' I am very sorry to see you looking so ill,' she answered, gently. ' My boot maker or my tailor would say as much as that. Tell me you are glad to see me \u2014 me \u2014 even the poor wreck I am.'"], [61, "kenrick's return. 53 There are pardonable hypocrisies in this life. Beatrix's eyes brimmed over with tears. She was deeply sorry for him, sorry that she could find no love for him in her heart, only infinite pity. ' I am very glad you are safe at home,' she said, ' we have all beeu anxious about you.' A poor welcome for a man who had lived through six months' hard fighting with brown Buddhist soldiers, for the sake of this moment. But he could not upbraid his betrothed for unkindness just now. Mrs. Dulcimer was there, tearful but loquacious, and he could not open his heart before Mrs. Dulcimer. After breakfast next morning Kenrick asked Beatrix to go for a walk on the platform Avith him. They were to drive over to Culverhouse Castle in the afternoon. It was a dim autumnal morning, the opposite shore veiled in mist, the water a dull gray, every thing placid and subdued in colour \u2014 a moruing that had the calmness and grayness of advancing age \u2014 the dull repose which befits man's closing years. ' My dearest love, your letters have been all kindness,' said Kenrick. ' There has not been much"], [62, "54 AN OPEN VERDICT. love in them, but I suppose I have no right to com plain of that. You did not promise to love me. Your letters have made me happy. But yesterday I confess I was wounded by your reception of me. You were so cold, so silent. I looked in vain for the greeting I had foreshadowed. It seemed that you had come to meet me as a duty, that you wished yourself away.

' Pray do not imagine anything of the kind. The change in you makes no difference in me. I am proud to think that you have done your duty, that you have been brave and noble, and have won praise and honour. Do you suppose I do not like you better for that ?

If there were, if you were maimed and scarred so as to be hardly recognisable, I would remember that you had been Avounded in the performance of your duty, and I would honour your wounds. No, Kenrick, believe me that could not make any barrier between us.' 'Yet there is a barrier.' She had not the cruelty to answer the cold hard truth. He was ill and weak. He looked at her Avith eyes that seemed to implore any de ception rather than a reality that would crush him. He had loved her and believed in her, when the man she loved had doubted and left her. He was at least entitled to gratitude and regard. 'I have promised to be your wife, and I am going to keep my promise,' she said, gravely. Then I am happy. ShaU it be soon, dearest?' It shall be when you like after the new year. And am I to leave the army ? ' ' No,' she answered, quickly. ' I am proud of your profession.

' It Avill be my duty to go with you.' ' My love, I have no words to say how happy you have made me. It would have been a grief to give up my profession, but I would have done it without a Avord, in obedience to your wish.' 'A wife should have no wish about serious things in opposition to her husband,' ansAvered Beatrix. They were at Culverhouse Castle before dusk, and again the village gossips Avere bobbing to Beatrix, this time with the assurance, derived from Betty Mopson's direct assertion, that she was to be their Lady Bountiful, the source of com fort and blessing at Christmastide, and in all time of trouble. They spent a calm and quiet week at the castle. Beatrix liked the grav oM buildings, with"], [65, "KENRICK'S RETURN. 57 their quaint mixture of ecclesiastical and domestic uses. First a castle, then an abbey, then a good old Tudor dwelling-house. That was the history of Culverhouse. Kenrick brought out old county chronicles to prove what a big place it had been in its time. How it had belonged to a warrior of the Culverhouse breed in the days of the first crusade; how it had been afterwards surrendered to the Church by a sinning and repenting Cul verhouse ; and how, after sequestration and mal appropriation under the tyrant Harry, it had come back by marriage to the Culverhouses, in a most miraculous way. ' Your house seems to have always been but tressed by heiresses,' said Mr. Dulcimer, poring over a musty parchment that Kenrick had pro duced for his inspection. ' You have been a very lucky family.' ' Luckier than we have deserved, I fear,' an swered Kenrick, with a glance at Beatrix. They all went to Little Yafford at the end of the week, and Kenrick was established at the Vicarage, under strict charge of Rebecca.

He bore it all meekly, for was not Mrs. Dulcimer the best friend he had, since it was she who had first suggested his winning Beatrix ? They were to be married early in the year. Everybody was talking about it already. It Avould be a much more interesting marriage than Mr. Piper's second nuptials, though that event had kept the village gossips alive for full six weeks. The tide of popular feeling had turned, and Beatrix now stood high in the estimation of her neigh bours. Even Miss Coyle was silent, contenting herself with an occasional shrug of her shoulders, or a significant elevation of her grizzled eyebroAvs. The slander had died a natural death, it had ex pired of inanition.

As Kenrick grew stronger they rode together across the wild bleak moor, and the fierce winds blew health and power into the soldier's lungs. Kenrick spent some of his evenings at the dull old Water House, in that pretty white panelled sitting-room that had been so long shut up.

' cried Mrs. Dulcimer to Beatrix one day, in a rapture of admiration for her protegSe. ' I never saAv a man so devoted.' ' Do you really think he is so very fond of me ? ' asked Beatrix, gravely. ' My dear, how sad and distressed you look ! as if his love Avere a thing to be sorry about. Yes, I do think and know so. Can you for a moment doubt it ? ' ' I have fancied that our marriage was on both sides rather one of convenience than inclination. He can give me the protection of an honourable name, my fortune can free his estate. AVe like each other very much, and, I hope, esteem each other. But I don't think there is much love on either side. He makes pretty speeches, of course. That is a compli ment to my sex and my fortune. Don't you re member Mr. Dulcimer telling us that Solon made it a law that heiresses should be treated with particular respect ? ' ' I know nothing about Solon,' exclaimed the"], [70, "62 AN OPEN VERDICT. Vicar's wife, getting angry, ' but I know that poor yroung man is passionately in love with you. Why, child, he idolizes you. One can see it with half an eye.' ' Then I am very sorry for him,' said Beatrix, and there was an earnestness in her tone that startled the easy-tempered Mrs. Dulcimer. ' Sorry that your affianced husband is devoted to you ! My dear Beatrix, you must be going out of your mind.' 'I sometimes think I am,' answered Beatrix, in a low voice. This conversation occurred about a fortnight before the wedding day. It made Mrs. Dulcimer very uncomfortable, but she said no word about it to anybody, not even to her chosen confidante, Rebecca Was it possible, poor Mrs. Dulcimer asked herself, that this match, the crowning glory of all her efforts, was going to turn out Ul ? Beatrix sent for Mr. Scratchell next day, and received him alone in her morning-room. ' I suppose you know that Sir Kenrick's estate is heavily encumbered ? ' she said."], [71, "63 MR. SCRATCHELL GOES TO LONDON. ' Yes,' answered the lawyer, ' of course that wiU be considered in the settlements. It will be my care to protect your interests.' ' Never mind my interests or the settlements, yet awhile. I want to pay off those mortgages before there is any question of settlements.' ' You pay them off, before you are Sir Kenrick's wife ! My dear Miss Harefield, what an extraordinary notion ! ' ' I cannot see that. My money is to release the estate sooner or later. That is an understood thing between Sir Kenrick and me. Why should I not do it before I am his wife ? I, Beatrix Harefield, for him as my future husband, am surely able to pay off these mortgages.' 'As the title deeds are deposited with Sir Ken rick's bankers, under an engagement to execute a formal deed when requested, anybody can pay off the mortgage,' answered the lawyer, ' but there is some hazard in such a proceeding.

Failing a son of yours, the estate would go to his cousin CyrU. Ah, I see that fact rather startles you,' said the unconscious lawyer, perceiving that Beatrix paled at the mention of her lost lover's name. ' These are serious considerations,' urged Mr. Scratchell. ' I should strongly recommend you not to touch those mortgages with your little finger until you have two or three sons of your own. Why should you throw away fifty thousand pounds for Mr. Cyril Culverhouse's ultimate benefit ? ' ' It wUl be for Sir Kenrick's benefit as lone: as he lives.' ' Yes, but Sir Kenrick may not be a long-lived man. I don't want to make you unhappy about him, but I don't think he looks like one. And then there are the fortunes of war. He may be kiUed in battle.

You may just as AveU make yourself agreeable whUe I am in your power, and let me have my own way.' Mr. Scratchell hesitated, sorely perplexed. To make himself disagreeable to Beatrix, even in the endeavour to protect her interests, might be fatal. Women are such self-willed, unreasonable creatures, he argued within himself. If he thwarted her in this ridiculous whim, she might resent his conduct all her life. In a year, as she had reminded him, she would be sole mistress of her fortune. She might dismiss him from his agency, which would be simple and unmitigated ruin. He was as dependent upon the Harefield estate for sustenance as a barnacle on a ship's bottom. In a word he could not afford to offend her. 'You have another trustee to consult,' he sug- gested. ' Mr. Dulcimer? Oh, I know he will consent. ' Because he's a fool.' VOL. III.

' Mortgage one estate \u2014 your own \u2014 to set free your husband's ! Was there ever anything so pre posterous ? ' ' I take a warm interest in one estate, and no interest in the other,' answered Beatrix. ' What is the good of property if one cannot do what one likes with it ?

Her impetuosity bewUdered Mr. Scratchell. She ran out of the room, and reappeared in a minute or"], [76, "68 AN OPEN VERDICT. so in her bonnet and fur jacket. He felt himself revolving in a whirlpool. To leave his home at half an hour's notice, and go tearing off to London ! He was rather pleased at the idea of a visit to London at a client's expense. TraveUing, hotel charges, every thing would be paid for him on the highest level. He had not seen the metropolis for ten years. It would be an outing such as he had never had in his life before. He began to hope that Mr. Dulcimer would consent to his ward's wUd scheme. They found the Vicar in his beloved Ubrary, surrounded with bulky folios, his feet on the fender, and his mind a thousand mUes away, with the primitive Aryan races. He was tracing the footsteps of a nomadic Indian tribe from fertile vaUeys east ward of the Caspian, through Persia and Asia Minor, to the shores of the Hellespont, where they were to crop up by and by as the Heraclid\u00e6. ' My dear Beatrix,' he said, ' the more I ruminate upon the subject, the more I am convinced that the Mosaic account is true, and that aU the races of men have come from one common centre \u2014 in the East.' ' Then how do you account for the wooUy-headed"], [77, "MR. SCRATCHELL GOES TO LONDON. 69 niggers, and the Laplanders, and the people with pink eyes ? ' inquired Mr. ScratcheU. 'Climate, my dear sir, climate. A question of atmospheric influences.' ' Dear Mr. Dulcimer, I have come to ask you a favour,' said Beatrix. 'It is granted beforehand, dear chUd,' said the Vicar, kissing her hand. The Aryan races had been particularly amenable to Mr. Dulcimer that morning, and the Vicar, always good-tempered, was absolutely overflowing with benevolence. ' Oh, but this is a very serious matter,' inter posed Mr. ScratcheU, anxious to do his duty. ' You'U have to give it your grave consideration.' ' I'm all attention,' repUed Mr. Dulcimer, with one eye on the Heraclid\u00e6. Beatrix explained her desire to set Sir Kenrick's estate free. ' Well, my love, you have always intended to pay off those charges after your marriage, have you not ? ' asked the Vicar, with a business-like air. ' Certainly.'"], [78, "70 AN OPEN VERDICT. ' Then I cannot see that it makes any difference whether you pay them off before or after. Scratchell can protect your future interests in framing your marriage settlements. Be sure you see to that, Scratchell. It is somewhat Quixotic, my dear Beatrix, to take time by the forelock in this way, but it can do no harm, and it will afford Kenrick another evidence of your generous character.' Mr. Scratchell did not feel himself called upon to explain to the Vicar all those objections which he had already expounded to Beatrix. If these people liked to make fools of themselves, it was not for him to hinder them. His own interest clearly lay in pleasing Miss Harefield. To do otherwise would be to take the bread out of the mouths of his innocent offspring. And then there was the tempting idea of a holiday in London, and the prospect of a longish bill of costs at the end of all. Decidedly it would be sheer madness stubbornly to oppose this romantic young lady's caprice. Miss Harefield's carriage was waiting at the Vicarage gate. ' It's a quarter past twelve/ she said, looking at"], [79, "71 MR. SCRATCHELL GOES TO LONDON. her watch. 'You have just an hour and three quarters to pack your carpet bag and drive to the station. Pray don't miss the tAvo o'clock train. You know Avhere to find Sir Kenrick's lawyers ? ' ' Yes.' 'Bemember, Sir Kenrick is to know nothing about what we are doing. You are to make that a condition with his bankers. He is to know nothing till I choose to tell him. It will not be later than our wedding-day.' ' But the settlement ? ' 'I will have no settlements,' said Beatrix, im patiently. ' My dear Miss Harefield, you must be mad.' ' At any rate I will have no settlement that can interfere with my payment of those incumbrances. That is a free gift to Sir Kenrick, as much as if I were to give you a hundred-pound note. I never want to hear about it, or to think about it. I look upon the fifty thousand pounds as gone \u2014 sunk at the bottom of a well.' ' You are a most extraordinary young lady.' ' If you waste your time in wondering at me, you Avill lose the London train.'"], [80, "72 AN OPEN VERDICT. Mr. Scratchell got into the carriage obediently, and was driven to his own house, where his apparition in a landau drawn by a pair of spirited horses caused wonder and consternation in all the household. That wonder increased when Mr. Scratchell informed his family that he was going to London on particular business for Miss Hare field, that he wanted a carpet bag packed with three or four shirts \u2014 his best \u2014 meaning those that were not too conspicuously frayed at the edges of the pleats and collars \u2014 and that his wife and children were to look sharp, and Avere not to bother him with questions. Poor Mrs. Scratchell ran off in a flutter to explore her husband's wardrobe, in AA'hich every thing was more or less the worse for wear, except the new suit he had bought for his daughter's wedding. The girls and boys meanwhile surrounded their father, like the merchant's daughters in the story of Beauty and the Beast, each anxious that he should bring something from London. 'Bring me a new dress, papa. If you are going on Miss Harefield's business you will get lots of money,' pleaded Clementina."], [81, "MR. SCRATCHELL GOES TO LONDON. 73 ' Do bring me a winter bonnet, papa, black velvet lined with pink,' asked Flora. ' You might get us a cricket bat, father,' said Adolphus, a boy who always spoke of himself in the plural, as if to give prominence to his insignificance. ' Go and cut me some sandwiches, girls, and mix me a little weak gin and water in a bottle,' said Mr. Scratchell. 'It will be night before I get to London.' ' And then you will go to an hotel, I suppose ? Won't you be grand !' cried Clementina, who fan cied that the people who stayed at hotels were a splendid and luxurious race apart from the mass of mankind. ' I shall stay at Sam's Coffee-house in the Strand,' said Mr. Scratchell, with a conscientious air. ' I am not going to waste Miss Harefield's money on fine hotels.' A quarter of an hour later and Mr. Scratchell had torn himself from the bosom of his family, and was being driven at a brisk trot towards Great Yafford."], [82, "CHAPTEE VI. THE SECOND MRS. PIPER. Bella was reigning at the Park in all the glory of new-fledged royalty, her husband fascinated and subservient, her step-children all packed off to school, the sober old Georgian barrack trans formed by new furniture and improvements of all kinds. At his wife's urgent desire Mr. Piper had bought the estate from Sir Philip Dulcimer, who, never having liked it, was very glad to turn it into money, which, carefully invested in railway shares, might bring him in five or six per cent., instead of the scanty two and a half which his paternal acres had yielded. Mr. Piper Avas there fore now Mr. Dulcimer's patron, as Bella reflected with a thrill of pride. She had ascended a good many steps above poor Mrs. Dulcimer, who had been so patronizingly good-natured to her in the days of her poverty."], [83, "75 THE SECOND MRS. PIPER. For the brief three months of his wedded life Ebenezer Piper had been living in a state of chronic astonishment. ' This little woman,' as he called his wife, absolutely took his breath away. Her coolness, her self-assurance, her air of having been used to the possession of unlimited wealth from her babyhood, her insolence to people of higher rank \u2014 Lady Jane Gowry, for instance, and the Pynsents, and all the notabilities of Little Yafford \u2014 these things filled him with admiring surprise. She was not at all the kind of wife he had expected to find her. He had chosen her for her softness and pliability, and he found her hard and bright as some sparkling gem. He had ex pected to rule and govern her as easily as a little child, and behold! she was ruling and governing him. He was too much under the spell of her fascination to complain yet awhile ; but this kind of thing was not at all what he had intended. He held himself in reserve. Never was there such a change in any house hold. A butler in solemn black, with a powdered footman for his assistant, took the place of the"], [84, "76 AN OPEN VERDICT. decent parlourmaid, in her starched cap and apron. The first Mrs. Piper had never consented to have indoor men-servants. ' My dear, why don't you keep a man V Mr. Piper had sometimes inquired. ' He'd do much better than these girls of yours, who never quite know their business.' ' Piper,' his wife had answered solemnly, ' I am not going to bring you to ruin. The girls are bad enough, what with their extravagance and their followers, but a man Avould eat us out of house and home before we knew where we were.' 'Please yourself, my dear,' returned Mr. Piper, ' and you'll please me.' Thus it was that the Piper establishment had been conducted upon a strictly middle-class foot ing. Now everything was on an aristocratic level. The present Mrs. Piper had a Frenchwoman for her own maid. She had a groom in top boots to sit behind her pony carriage. When she drove in her barouche the groom sat beside the coachman,"], [85, "THE SECOND MRS. PIPER. 77 and the two pairs of top-boots had a dazzling effect. Mr. Piper was rather astonished at the bootmaker's bill. 'My pet, here's no end of money to pay for top-boots,' he remarked. ' I can't say I see the use of 'em. Poor Moggie got on very well without top boots.' ' I hope you don't expect me to go out with a coachman in trousers,' exclaimed Bella. 'I might as well have a fly from the \" Crown\" at once.' ' My love, I should have thought that any kind of conveyance would have been a novelty to you, and that you'd hardly have been so particular about the livery,' suggested Mr. Piper. ' I could have gone on foot all my life,' said Bella, ' but if I am to have a carriage I must have it decently appointed. I don't want to hang be tween heaven and earth, like Mahomet's coffin.' Mahomet's coffin extinguished Mr. Piper. It had been flung at his head a good many times upon his venturing to object to his young wife's ex- travagance. ' And after all 1 am proud to see how Avell"], [86, "78 AN OPEN VERDICT. she does it,' he said to himself, smiling an uxorious smile. ' She's a regular little duchess.' And henceforAvard in familiar conversation Mr. Piper Avas apt to speak of his Avife as the ' Duchess.' The house \u2014 which had iioav become his freehold \u2014 was made so fine that Mr. Piper hardly knew him self in it. Persian carpets of vivid and various hues were spread on the black and white marble of the hall, brocaded satin curtains, violet lined with amber, veiled the doors between hall and conservatory. The drawing-room Avas pale blue and gold, rich in easy chairs and tall gilded stands supporting Sevres vases filled with flowers. The chief bedroom was apple-green. Every thing was radiant and smiling, dazzling with gold and colour. ' My word ! it's hke living in a bower,' said Mr. Piper, and he hummed a song that was then not quite forgotten \u2014 ' There's a bower of roses by Bendemeer's stream.' Having made her house beautiful, Mrs. Piper's next desire naturally was to exhibit her splendour to the envious eyes of people with inferior houses."], [87, "79 THE SECOND MRS. PIPER. She therefore began to issue invitations on as large a scale as the neighbourhood allowed. These were not all responded to as cordially as she would have wished. Lady Jane Gowry had honoured Bella with a condescending call, but she flatly declined Mr. and Mrs. Piper's invitation to dinner, on the ground that at her age she could not afford to extend the circle of her visiting acquaintance. ' The people I dine with are people I have known for half a century,' she wrote to Mrs. Piper. ' I am too old to go out often, so I only go to very old friends. But if you and Mr. Piper like to come and take a cup of tea with me any Tuesday evening I shall be very happy to see you.' ' After all, Lady Jane's chestnut wig and violet powdered complexion are not much loss,' said Bella. ' No, they ain't, but I should like to have taken the old woman to dinner upon my arm, before the Porkmans and the Wigzells,' remarked Mr. Piper. ' I don't believe they ever sat down to dinner with a title in the whole course of their natural lives. Wouldn't old Timperley have stared ! Earls' daugh ters don't come his way often, I reckon.'"], [88, "80 AN OPEN VERDICT. Bella found that she would have to content herself in a great measure with the society of the Timperleys, the Porkmans, the Wigzells, and all the ramifications of those family trees. Every- body in this set was rich, and the chief struggle of everybody's life seemed to be to spend more money upon display than his or her neighbour. The men boasted of their cellars, and vied with each other in giving high prices for their wines. A feAv loftier spirits bought pictures, and tasked patronizingly of their favourite Eoyal Academicians. They seemed to think that Frith and Millais had been created for them, like Holbein for Henry the Eighth, or Vandyke for Charles the First. They all lived in brand-new houses within a few miles of Great Yafford, houses built by themselves, all spick and span and fresh from the builder's hand, with not so much as an elderly apple-tree on the premises. The county people had been condescendingly civil to the new Mrs. Piper; but that was all. They called upon her, and contemplated her curiously, as if she had been something to wonder at, like the"], [89, "81 THE SECOND MRS. PIPER. only living gorilla. She was asked to three large dinners, at which she felt herself less than nobody \u2014 though she wore laces and jewels enough for a dowager of ancient lineage. Bella, clever as she was, found that these people's thoughts were not her thoughts, nor their ways her ways \u2014 and that afl the distance between the east and west was not wider than the gulf between her and the county families. But this was a surmountable difficulty, she told herself. She was quick at learn ing languages, and would learn the jargon of the county families as easily as she had learned Italian. These scraps of social slang, these continual allusions to people she did not know, and pleasures she had never shared, could hardly be so difficult as Dante. Mr. Piper looked on and admired, while his young wife wasted his money, laughed at his friends, and made light of his opinions ; but he was not altogether satisfied or easy in his mind. It would not be always so, he thought. There would come a day ! The Duchess was carrying things with a high hand. It was perhaps just as well to let her have her fling. She was so unac- VOL. III.

And, after all, this in- creased expenditure was pleasanter than poor Moggie's carefulness and perpetual lamentations about butcher's bills and pounds of butter. Mr. Piper liked his new butler, and was even in his heart of hearts not displeased with the poAvdered footman or the top-booted groom, though he affected to despise those follies. He felt himself on a level with the Timperleys in their scarlet Tudor mansion, with its jutting windows and leaden lattices, its deep porch and iron-studded door, its gilded vane and many gables, at once intensely old and dazzlingly new. He was living as became his Avealth and social status, living like the Porkmans and the Wigzells, and the rest of his purse-proud acquaintance. The first Mrs. Piper had hung upon him like a log on a , hobbled donkey, and had deprived him of all freedom, with her ever lasting economical scruples. He had been afraid to give a dinner party, knowing that for a month after there would be ceaseless wailings about the expense of the feast."], [91, "THE SECOND MRS. PIPER 83 ' Piper, have you any idea what grouse were when you asked Mr. Timperley to dinner last August ? ' Mrs. Piper would demand. 'I know the brace we had Avere uncommonly tough, and precious badly cooked,' Mr. Piper would retort. ' They were tAvelve shillings a brace, Piper. Here's the poulterer's bill to prove it to you. I call it sinful to eat game at such a price. You know you ordered them, Piper. I should have inquired what they were to cost \u2014 but you never do.' ' I wanted to give Timperley a decent dinner,' Mr. Piper would reply. ' Hang it, Moggie ! when I go to Timperley's he feeds me on the fat of the land. Besides, we can afford it.' ' Nobody can afford wanton extravagance,' Mrs. Piper would groan; and this kind of conversation Avould occur daily. Thus it was a new thing to Mr. Piper to have his domestic life administered with liberal-handed luxury, to hear no complaints about the miscon duct of servants or the price of provisions, not to"], [92, "84 AN OPEN VERDICT. be awakened abruptly from his after-dinner nap to be told that bread had gone up a halfpenny, or that Scrogfield was charging thirteen-pence for fillet of veal. ' Upon my word, little woman,' he exclaimed one day, delighted with his wife's cleverness, ' you have made the house a paradise.' It was still more a paradise after Christmas, for the second Mrs. Piper, having found out that her step-daughters were sadly in want of dancing and calisthenics, which they could not be taught pro perly at home, and would be much benefited by being transplanted to Miss Turk's boarding school, on the outskirts of Great Yafford, the school at which Mrs. Dulcimer and all the best people in the neighbourhood had been educated, under the aunts and predecessors of the reigning Miss Turk. Mr. Piper was rather disappointed, just at first, by this idea of Bella's. He had hoped to have his daughters always at home. They were troublesome, rude, and noisy, but still Mr. Piper loved them, as the gladiator loved his young barbarians. 'I thought you Avould haA7e gone on teaching"], [93, "85 THE SECOND MRS. PIPER. the girls, little woman,' he said, with a chap-fallen air. ' My dear Mr. Piper, what time should I have for society, or for you, if I did that ? Quite impossible. Besides, the girls will be a great deal better at a first-rate school. They are too high-spirited to obey me, and now I am their mamma they would laugh at my attempts to teach them.' Mr. Piper sighed and submitted. The boys went to school, as a matter of course. He had no objection to that. But he had hoped that his daughters would stay at home, and cheer his breakfast-table with their chubby common-place faces and small second-hand jokes, and thump their pianoforte duets of an evening for his delectation. One evil which Mr. Piper had feared in taking Bella for his wife had not befallen him. He had fancied that the Park would be overrun with Scratch ells, that Bella, as an affectionate member of a large family, would want to make his house a free warren for her father and mother, brothers and sisters. But this apprehension of Mr. Piper's was in no manner realized. Bella sent her family ceremonious"], [94, "86 AN OPEN VERDICT. invitations to her second best parties, and made a duty call upon her mother after church every Sunday, a time at which Mrs. Scratchell was less distracted by thoughts about the kettle or the kitchen generally than at other periods of her exist ence ; for the Scratchelfs always had a cold dinner on the Sabbath, not so much from piety as from a conviction of Mrs. Scratchelfs that cold meat went further than hot. This kind of intercourse was not what the Scratchells \u2014 especially Clementina and Flora \u2014 had expected ; but they were fain to be thankful for the favours they received, and never carried their murmurs further than the sacred home circle, where, sitting round the Avinter fire, they discoursed at their ease upon Bella's worldliness and want of natural feeling. ' I was so glad when Lady Jane refused to go to her dinner party,' said Clementina. 'We weren't asked to that party. Oh no. We were not good enough to meet Lady Jane \u2014 nor the Timperleys either. And Lady Jane wrote and told Bella that she only went out to dine with old friends. Wasn't that splendid ? '"], [95, "87 THE SECOND MRS. PIPER. ' Did Bella tell you ? ' asked Mr. Scratchell.

'My dear,' said Mrs. Dulcimer to Beatrix quite suddenly one evening, when she and Kenrick were sitting round the fire in the snug dining-room, a little Avhile before tea, ' Cyril must certainly assist at your marriage.' Happily for Beatrix, the lamp had not yet been brought in. There was only the changeful and uncertain firelight, which just at this moment left her face in shadow. ' Well, yes,' returned Kenrick. ' I think Cyril ought to be invited. If he were not present it would look as if there were some quarrel between us. And we are very good friends, are we not, dear?' he added, turning to his betrothed. ' Yes,' faltered Beatrix. ' If he were not here people would talk,' pursued Mrs. Dulcimer.

' His absence might cause a scandal, dearest. Eemember, he is my nearest relation, known to be quite near at hand, and closely associated Avith this place.

' They shall have no reason for saying anything of the kind,' Beatrix answered, proudly. ' Pray invite your cousin.' 'Now you are angry.' ' Not with you,' she answered, quickly. ' I am angry with the world, life, fate.' ' What, Beatrix, now, after you have made me so happy, when all our life is smiling upon us \u2014 every cloud gone ? ' \\ Beatrix's only answer was a sigh. But Kenrick was rapt in the placid delight of his good fortune. He loved his betrothed too well to believe it possible that she did not love him. They had lived so hap pily, as it seemed to him, for nearly four months, in each other's society. They had never had a dis pute \u2014 or even a difference of opinion. Could he doubt that she had grown fonder of him day by day in all that time ? Her irritation to-night was natural, he argued. It arose from her scorn of the scandals that had darkened her young life. It was hard for her to forget these things."], [99, "91 IN THE CHURCHYARD. Kenrick wrote next day to his cousin : ' Dear Cyril, \u2014 The Dulcimers say you ought to assist at my wedding, and I think the same. Will you come ? ' Yours always, ' Kenrick.'

' My time is closely occupied here, so my visit must be of the shortest. I will come on Tuesday afternoon, and must return on Wednesday, directly after the wedding.

Cyril was evidently reconciled to the existing state of things. After all it was his own doi ng, Kenrick thought. He had no right to complain. Kenrick showed the letter to Beatrix, who read it slowly and thoughtfully, and returned it to him without a word. ' A gentleman-like letter, isn't it ? ' asked Ken- rick. ' Very,' she answered. Did it please her that her former lover should write in so friendly a tone \u2014 that he should be willing to assist in the solemn act that was to make their severance irrevocable ? No. His willingness stung her to the quick. 'He never loved me,' she thought. 'It was Bella's pretty face that he really cared for. But he thought my fortune would help him in doing good, and he was willing to sacrifice his own inclination in order to be useful to others. He liked me just well enough, perhaps, to be reconciled to the idea of marrying me and making use of my fortune. And then when the slander arose he dreAV back.

Tuesday morning had come. Mr. Scratchell had called at the Water House to tell Miss Harefield that everything was done according to her wish. The equitable charge on Kenrick's estate had been paid off. Culverhouse Castle was as free as it had been in the reign of its wealthiest possessors. ' I am very glad it is done,' said Beatrix, and it was the first gladness she had shown for some days. Madame Leonard wanted her to be interested in her trousseau, which was being packed by that clever little Frenchwoman and the honest unhandy English maid. Everything had been left to Madame Leonard. Beatrix had taken no trouble about this moun tain of Dew clothes which people had declared she must have, as if to mark distinctly that to get married is to turn over a new leaf in the volume of Use.

' Dear Madame Leonard, I am more than con tent. But I am not very fond of fine clothes. They do not fill my mind as they seem to do with some people.' ' Ah, my dear,' cried the Frenchwoman, ' it is all very well to be high and mighty ; but I can teU you there are times in a woman's life when if she did not think about her dress she would have nothing to think of. And it is better to think of a new gown than a new lover. That amuses. And after all it is innocent. To talk of dress does no one any harm. It is not like scandal.' ' Dear Madame Leonard, you are wiser than I. But never mind the trousseau just now. Please pack my plainest dresses and wraps in one trunk. I am not going to travel with all those huge boxes, am I ? ' 'No, the biggest of those are to be sent"], [103, "95 IN THE CHURCHYARD. straight to India. And the smaller are to meet you at Brindisi.' Sir Kenrick and his bride were to spend their honeymoon in Paris and in Italy, travelling by easy stages to Brindisi, whence they were to start for India early in April, a fact which Mrs. Dul cimer bitterly bewailed. ' I thought Kenrick would sell out,' she said, ' and that you would divide your lives between Culverhouse Castle and the Water House.' ' That would have been to spoil Kenrick's career, just as it promises distinction,' answered Beatrix. ' I should regard that as a kind of assassination.' Upon this last day of her maiden life Beatrix was strangely absent and troubled in manner. She shrank even from Madame Leonard's gentle sympathy, and while the anxious little woman was busy with the trunk and packing-cases, the OAvner of aU that finery paced the garden walk by the dull gray river, reckless of the biting east wind, Avrapped in gloomy thoughts. The swollen waters were rushing under the old stone arch, the moor was darkly purple against a sunless"], [104, "96 AN OPEN VERDICT. sky. AU nature seemed in harmony with the mind of to-morrow's bride. The packing business kept Madame Leonard and Mary closely occupied aU day, so Beatrix was undisturbed. Sir Kenrick had gone to Great Yafford to get the odds and ends Avanted to com plete his outfit. Mrs. Dulcimer was engaged Avith her dress for the wedding, which was being made at home, a process which necessitated frequent discussions and consultations with Eebecca and the dressmaker, and Avhich, undertaken from motives of economy, was likely to result in an expensive failure. Cyril was not expected till the evening. He was to arrive in time for the Vicar age tea, and was to occupy Mrs. Dulcimer's second best spare bedroom. Beatrix had promised to caU at the Vicarage some time in the afternoon. It was a visit she would gladly have avoided in her present frame of mind, but she thought if she did not go Mrs. Dulcimer would be Ukely to come to the Water House in quest of her, and that might prove a heavier in fliction. So she put on her bonnet directly after"], [105, "97 IN THE CHURCHYARD. luncheon, and walked across the windy bridge, and up the windy street to the Vicarage. It was between two and three o'clock, a very safe hour at which to pay her visit, since Cyril was not expected until half-past seven. She had seen his letter to Mrs. Dulcimer, in which he named the train that was to bring him. Mrs. Dulcimer was in her bedroom, with Ee becca and the dressmaker. Beatrix went up, at the housemaid's request, and found these three stitching and talking, as fast as tongues and needles could be driven. The dress had been three days in hand, but just at the last it was found necessary to put on an extra pressure to get it finished. Mrs. Dulcimer wa.s sewing the braid on the skirt, Eebecca was pushing strips of whalebone into the body, which looked as stiff as a strait-waistcoat or a suit of plate-armour; the dressmaker was cording a flounce. The room was streAvn with snippings of silk, satin, sarcenet, and lining, as thick as leaves in Vallombrosa. Mrs. Dulcimer looked the image of anxiety. If she had been a beauty of seventeen preparing for VOL. III. H"], [106, "98 AN OPEN VERDICT. her first ball, or a young actress about to make her debut in London, she could not have been more deeply concerned. 'Oh, Beatrix, I am so glad you have come,' she exclaimed, without stopping her needle. ' I long to know if you Uke it.' 'It 'was the dress, now hi scattered portions. Beatrix looked puzzled. ' My love, how absent-minded you are ! ' said Mrs. Dulcimer. ' Of course you can't judge of the general appearance tiU the flounces are on, and it all comes together. But you can teU me what you think of the colour and the style of trimming.' ' Oh, you mean the dress,' answered Beatrix, Avith cruel indifference. ' I think that silver-gray is a pretty colour.' ' It's the new shade,' said Mrs. Dulcimer. ' You are sure it's the new shade, are you not, Miss KiUick ? ' she asked, turning to the dressmaker. 'Yes, ma'am, it's quite the new shade,' an swered Miss KilUck solemnly. Beatrix seated herself by the fire, and idly watched the blaze, while Mrs. Dulcimer went on"], [107, "IN THE CHURCHYARD. 99 working. There was not much sustained conversa tion. Everybody except Beatrix was thinking of the dress. Miss KiUick and Eebecca had their mouths full of pins, and dropped a few whenever they spoke, like the girl in the fairy tale. After half an hour or so Beatrix rose to go, but Mrs. Dulcimer en treated her to stop till the dress was tried on. ' It wiU be ready in a quarter of an hour, Avon't it, Miss KiUick ? ' she inquired. They were all sitting close together now, Ee becca sewing the body to the skirt, the dress maker seAving on the final flounce. ' I don't suppose we shall be much longer, ma'am,' said Miss KiUick. ' And at four we are goiug to have a refresh ing cup of tea,' said the Vicar's wife, 'so you really must stop, Beatrix.' Beatrix could not refuse so small a favour, so she went on staring at the fire ; while the three workers hastened the finish of their task, Avith their heads close together, like the three fatal sisters intent upon the web of some particular destiny which Jove had ordered them to hurry to its conclusion."], [108, "100 AN OPEN VERDICT. 'There,' said the three simultaneously, 'it's done.' Five minutes later Mrs. Dulcimer was standing before her cheval glass, buttoned into her new gown, and trying to make it look as if it belonged to her, every fold having the stiffness, strangeness, and awk wardness which are characteristic of a new garment. Beatrix had to assist at the discussion as to whether the sleeve should not be shortened a quarter of an inch, or the shoulder seam taken up a little, or the waist tightened, or the- skirt lengthened. When she found herself free to depart the church clock was striking the quarter after four. The sky, which had brightened a little in the afternoon, was yellow in the west, where the sun would soon go down behind yonder black ridge of moor. The wind had dropped, and there was a mildness in the air like the sweet breath of early spring. There was a circuitous way to the Water House, through meadows that lay behind the churchyard. It was a solitary walk, that Beatrix liked at all times, and which particularly suited her humour just now. She went in at the wicket gate in the angle of the churchyard, and followed the narrow path between"], [109, "IN THE CHURCHYARD. 101 the crowded headstones,\u2014 commonplace memorials of harmless uneventful lives. The pathway took her by the side of the fine old parish church, close by the vestry, which was curi ously squeezed in at an angle between transept and chancel, under the diamond-paned Casement, beside which the white surplices were hanging, past the sunken door. Just as she came to the door it opened, and a man came out. She gave a little cry, and the whole scene seemed to rock before her eyes, the old gray wall, the crum bling tablets, the leafless elm branches, the tall black poplars, AA'hich rose Uke watch -toAvers between her and the sky. For a moment all seemed in tumul tuous motion, as if a whirlwind had risen. Then, with a great effort, she clasped the railings of a tomb close by, and commanded brain and body to be still. A hand was held out to her, and she took it Avith a mechanical air. Her lips moved slowly. ' Cyril.' Only his name, and the ice was broken. The next instant she had burst into passionate tears, and"], [110, "102 AN OPEN VERDICT. was hiding her face against the rusty insensible rail ings, anywhere, only to be out of his sight. Her whole frame was shaken by those sobs. He could not but perceive, he could not even pretend not to perceive, her distress. ' Forgive me,' he said gently. ' I am more than sorry that I came, if my presence grieves you. I ought not to have come, but,' he faltered a little here, ' respect for you, regard for my cousin, made it impos sible for me to refuse.' ' Eespect for me ! ' she exclaimed bitterly, lifting up her head, and choking down her sobs with a des perate effort, just as she had held herself back from unconsciousness a few moments before. ' Eespect for me \u2014 for a woman whom you could believe a poisoner ! ' ' Beatrix, I never believed ' he began. ' You did not believe me innocent, or you would not have forsaken me,' she said, confronting him with eyes that kindled as she spoke. He could not gainsay her. She had spoken truth. No, not if all the world had been against her, not at the scaffold's foot, could he have abandoned her, could he honestly have believed her guUtless."], [111, "103 IN THE CHURCHYARD. But now that he stood face to face with her, now that he saw that noble countenance, the splendid indignation of those eyes, he was as convinced of her innocence as if he had never doubted her. His past doubts seemed madness, or Avorse than madness, diabolical possession. 'If I had spoken with you after your father's death,' he said, ' if we had met face to face as we meet noAv, I should never have gone away. I would have borne the hardest things men could say of me, that I had married you for the sake of your fortune \u2014 that I had been unscrupulous because you were rich. I would have laughed such poisoned arrows to scorn for your dear sake.' ' You left me,' she said, growing colder as he greAv warm, gaining strength and firmness as he shoAved himseh weak. ' You left me. That is all. Perhaps you really never cared for me. Indeed, I have some reason to knoAV there was some one else you secretly preferred.' ' That is wholly false,' cried Cyril. ' I never loved but one woman, and you are she.' ' What does it matter ? Why try to explain the"], [112, "104 AN OPEN VERDICT. past ? It is all over and done with. To-morrow will make me your cousin's wife. And you are come to assist at my wedding. But how is it you are here so early ? You are not expected at the Vicarage till half-past seven.' ' I came by an earlier train than I intended, and having time to spare I went in to look at the old church,' he answered, hurriedly. 'And to pray for strength to bear to-morrow's agony,' he might have added, for he had been on his knees before the altar at which he had so often officiated, praying that his burden might be light ened for him. There was a silence. Beatrix stiU stood with her back to the railings that guarded the once splendid tomb of a knight banneret of Elizabeth's reign. She had just strength to stand calmly there, steadily con fronting her old lover, but she had no power to drag her limbs away from the spot. She knew that if she tried to move she must fall Uke a log at his feet ; so she stood there, cold aud white as the marble the tomb was made of. ' Beatrix,' cried Cyril, losing all mastery of him-"], [113, "105 IN THE CHURCHYARD. self in the bewUderment of being alone Avith her, close to her, as far from the outside world in that quiet corner of the churchyard as if they two had been lost upon the Avildest bit of moorland in the country. ' Beatrix, why are you going to marry Kenrick ? Why have you been in such haste to prove how utterly you had forgotten me ? ' 'Are you not glad my wounds have healed so quickly ? You have nothing to reproach yourself with on my account. Not even a broken heart.' ' And you love Kenrick ? ' he asked, wonderingly. ' He has never suspected me of a hideous crime. When every one spoke agaiust me, he was staunch and true. I am very grateful to him.' ' Gratitude is not love.' ' Perhaps not, but affection and gratitude are near akin, and Kenrick is satisfied with affection.' ' I would not be if I were he,' cried Cyril, beside himself with anger and jealousy. ' I Avould haAre nothing less than your love, your whole-hearted pas sionate love. What ! be content to dwell beside the narrow sluggish river, and never sicken for the wide wild sea?

'You have no right to say that. Do you think yourself so much better than he that no woman, having once loved you, can love him ? ' ' I know that no true woman ever loved truly twice. There is no such thing as second love Avorth haA7ing. It is the mere ghost of feeling, like a rose cut at midsummer to be shut up in a box and brought out at Christmas, revived by sulphur fumes \u25a0 \u2014 a phantom flower, with no more bloom or fresh ness than if it were made of paper. Just so much for second love.' If she could have stirred she would have left him, but she had still an acute sense of her helpless ness. She must stay and listen, let him say what he would. What was this conflict of feeling in her breast ? Passionate love, passionate anger, scorn that made it sweet to wound him, fondness that made her long to fling herself upon his breast and cry, ' Oh, give me shelter, giA7e me rest ! Let all the world go by. You and I can be all the world to each other.'"], [115, "107 IN THE CHURCHYARD. The yellow wintry light faded in the west, the sky greAV duU and bleak, the headstones had a grayer look. ' Why do you concern yourself about me ? ' she asked bitterly.

It is just as well to avoid the scandal of your absence. But that ends all betAveen us. We need never see each other's faces after to-morrow. Why should we say hard things, or talk about the past ?

He was mad with the pent-up feeling of all those long dreary days and nights in which he had fought with his passion, believing he had beaten it, only to find it now starting up in his soul, indestructible as the principle of evil.

He who had been weak as a"], [116, "108 AN OPEN VERDICT. child a few short weeks ago, was strong now with all the strength of a desperate tempted soul.

He went into the street, intending to order a carriage at the inn, but luckily found the flyman Avho had brought him from Great Yafford, refreshing his horse with a nosebag and himself with a pint of ale before a small beer-shop over against the church yard. He told this man to bring his fly close up to the gate for a lady. ' I must get back to the town directly,' said the man.

This was like his welcome at Southampton, when, with a heart burn ing with eager love, he had found only coldness and restraint in his betrothed.

And then he flung himself face downward on the floor, and gave vent to his passion in angry tears. He had been happier lying on the blood soaked ground under the waUs of Pegu, with the brown Burmese soldiers trampling upon him, and a very acute consciousness of a buUet in his shoulder. Never had he been so wretched as at this moment, never so angry with fate or his fellow-men.

How could a piece of such common clay as Mr. Scratchell comprehend the finer feelings of human porcelain ? He only thought it cracked. There was nothing more to be discovered at the Water House. Beatrix and her companion had gone. That was all. Miss Harefield had made her arrange ments with coolness and promptitude. It might be just possible to foUow her. But to what end ? Kenrick went in quest of Cyril. After a good deal of inquiry he found him with a bedridden old woman, listening to a doleful story of the winter's sufferings. ' I want to talk to you, Cyril,' said Kenrick, and, with a gentle apology, Cyril cut short the dame's rambling account of her bodily Uls. ' What is the matter, Ken ?

Fortunately Cyril passed him unawares on the road between the town and the viUage, so those two did not meet again.

The wedding was to have been strictly private \u2014 altogether different from the imposing ceremonial that had made Bella Scratchell the second Mrs. Piper. There were no guests to be put off at the last moment ; there was no confusion anywhere ; but there was a great deal of talk in Little Yafford when it became generally known, through Mrs. Pomfret, the pew-opener, that Sir Kenrick's marriage was not to be. There were various theories as to Beatrix Hare-"], [141, "MRS. PIPER'S DAY. 133 field's motive for her extraordinary conduct. ' Guilty conscience,' said Miss Coyle and her party. ' A prior attachment,' said the more charitably inclined. 'The girl must be wrong in her head,' said the matter-of fact matrons and middle-aged husbands, who could not understand the fits and starts of passion. Perhaps in all the neighbourhood there was only one person, except the rival cousins themselves, who guessed the real cause of Miss Harefield's flight. That person was Mrs. Piper. She knew how deeply Beatrix had loved Cyril, and it hardly surprised her that, at the last moment, she should refuse to con summate a loveless bond. ' It might have been happier for me if I had run away,' thought Bella, looking round her apple-green dressing-room, with all the gewgaws Mr. Piper's generosity had heaped upon her, ' yet any other life than this would be almost unbearable now.' Time went on. Kenrick returned to India, leaving his honour in Mr. Dulcimer's hands. Miss Harefield's money was to be paid back, and without loss of time. Kenrick's lawyers and Mr. Dulcimer were to arrange the matter between them somehow ;"], [142, "134 AN OPEN VERDICT. Kenrick did not care how ; but the thing must be done. On that point Sir Kenrick was firmly resolved. The lawyers were as slow as most of their craft, and saw no reason why such a business as this should be precipitated.

She hoped that Kenrick might, by fair means or foul, be made to keep the money. He had been cruelly Avronged.

There were mysteries that he wanted to solve in this Use, before he went to investigate the awful mystery beyond it. He wanted to stand face to face with Beatrix Hare field once more. He Avanted to know whether it was indeed for love of him she had at the last moment jilted his cousin. He wanted to find some stronger proof of her innocence than the sudden conviction that had flashed into his mind when he looked into her steadfast eyes, and saw scorn of his weak doubts, and fondest love for himself, at war in her soul. While he lived there was always a chance, however remote, of his discovering the truth. While he Uved there was always the possibility that Beatrix and he might meet. She was not his cousin's wife.

That is the trial.' There were tAvo of his parishioners at Bridford whom CyrU could not be content to leave behind him. Those Avere Emmanuel Joyce and his mother. Emmanuel's gratitude for the man who had risked his life to save him had done what argument and teaching might never have accomplished. Emmanuel was now a conscientious conforming Christian. He believed, as' the leper believed, because he had been saved. The conduct of one Christian man opened his heart to receive the sublime mystery of a Ee deemer who was more than man. He went to the altar without one lurking doubt. He made himself like a little child, and confessed that all the learning he had been so proud of was nothing, when weighed against his friend and teacher's one act of Christian self-abnegation. ' What was I that you should sacrifice yourself"], [146, "138 AN OPEN VERDICT. for me ? ' he said. ' When man can be so generous I wiU no longer refuse to believe that God can suffer and die for sinners.' ' I would have you believe upon better grounds than any friendly act of mine,' said Cyril. ' I have been face to face with death,' answered Joyce. ' Men learn strange things on their death beds. A death-bed repentance may be a poor thing, but a death-bed revelation may accompUsh what a life of study could not do.' And then Emmanuel, being by nature an enthu siast, talked wildly of the visions of his bed of pain \u2014 the cloud-curtain that had been lifted from the invisible world \u2014 the wonders that he had seen and heard in that mysterious border-land between life and death. Cyril asked no more than a simple unquestioning belief. It was with a thriU of joy that he saw Emmanuel kneeling before the altar rails, meekly lifting up his hands to receive the sacred symbols of Divine love. Could he leave his convert behind him in the fever tainted alley, where the sweet summertide was ever"], [147, "MRS. PIPER'S DAY. 139 the harbinger of death ? No. He made up his mind that Emmanuel and his mother should go with him. ' I am doubtful if you would be able to live at Little Yafford by shoe-mending,' he said, when he discussed the question with Joyce and the widow, ' but, if I could get the schoolmaster a better berth somewhere else, I am sure you could manage the school, with a little help from me at the beginning.' ' Oh, sir, it would be the very thing for him,' cried Mrs. Joyce. ' His father began life as a parish schoolmaster, and he gave Emmanuel a good plain education. He was very severe with the poor lad, but that was partly in his anxiety to make him a thorough scholar. I don't think there's any one could beat my boy in arithmetic or Bible history. I'm sure he could teach. You'd like to teach, wouldn't you, Emmanuel ? ' ' John Milton was a schoolmaster,' said Joyce, Avith his face aU aglow. ' I should like it of all things, if you think I could do it, Mr. Culverhouse.' ' As for book learning,' cried the widow, ' I don't think there's one in a thousand \u2014 no, not even among the gentlefolks \u2014 has read as much as my Emmanuel.'"], [148, "140 AN OPEN VERDICT. ' A wide range of reading Avould hardly be required, though every teacher must be the better for it,' said Cyril, smiling. 'But I know that Emmanuel has been well grounded in a plain English education, and that he now thinks rightly upon reUgious ques tions, so I fancy he might teach well in our parish school. Of course, the first thing to be done is to get a better place for the present man, who is a very good master.' Cyril did not add, as he might have done, that the present schoolmaster's merits were chiefly his work. He had taken infinite pains to teach the teacher as well as the pupils. Before Cyril had been at Little Yafford a month he contrived to get the schoolmaster transferred to a more profitable situation forty miles away, and to get Emmanuel Joyce accepted as master upon probation. He was to do the work for a quarter without re muneration ; and if he succeeded in pleasing the Vicar and churchwardens, was to be engaged at the end of that time at the handsome stipend of five-and thirty pounds a year, with a cottage adjoining the school, and an allowance of coals and candles.

And then Mrs. Joyce reminded her son how, before illness crippled his father, and brought poverty and trouble, they had lived in a four-roomed house just like this, with a scullery at the back of the kitchen, which might be accounted a fifth room, and a little yard where they were able to grow scarlet runners.

They went out to explore the garden, enraptured with everything. It was quite an extensive garden, nearly a quarter of an acre. There were potatoes, and apple trees, and gooseberry and currant bushes, and roses in abundance. And there was room for scarlet runners, as Mrs. Joyce exclaimed delightedly.

It was very little, perhaps, but the frugal widow could manage to make it serve, and it was a great deal for Cyril to give out of his small means.

On Sunday he sat at the end of the church, with his pupUs ranged before him on a row of benches beside the organ. He kept them in wonderful order, and the occasional dropping of marbles and attacks of spasmodic coughing which had been apt to disturb the congregation under the rule of Emmanuel's predecessor were no longer heard. Cyril was delighted at the success of his scheme. The Vicar and churchwardens did not wait for the three months of probation to come to an end, before they expressed their satisfaction.

He Avas not a scandalmonger like Miss Coyle. He generally thought the Avorst of people, but he ahvays kept his thoughts to himself. He believed every busi nessman, except Mr. Piper, to be an innate rogue, and on the verge of insolvency, but he gave no expres sion to his doubts. He was not a lively companion, so far as conversation goes, but he Avas an accom plished listener ; he had the art of looking ineffably wise, and us appearing to be able to give an im mense deal of information, if he had not preferred to Avithhold it.

She fancied that he knew everything that Avas passing in her mind \u2014 that he Avas perfectly familiar Avith her motive for marrying his old employer \u2014 that he had Aveighed and measured her till he Avas master of her most secret thoughts.

CAPTAIN STANDISH. Whether it was that Mr. Piper's plain speaking had its effect, or that Bella grew wise by experience, is an open question ; but soon after the particular Thursday upon which Mr. Chumney appeared as an unwelcome guest, the second Mrs. Piper changed her tactics altogether. She left off besieg ing the county people in their impregnable fortresses, surrounded with the moat of exclusheness, and shut in with the portcullis of pride. She dropped a good many of those ultra-genteel professional people against Avhose impertinence Mr. Piper had protested, and she opened her house freely to her husband's commercial allies of the past \u2014 the Wig zell's, the Porkmans, the Timperleys, and a good many more of the same class. When she had made these people understand that her Thursday afternoon reception meant some-"], [163, "155 CAPTAIN STANDISH. thing lively and sociable she Avas no longer without visitors. The midsummer weather suggested a tent on the laAvn, where tea and claret cup, and strawberries and cream, might be taken amidst the perfume of roses and warbling of blackbirds. Archery was in troduced on the long stretch of grass on the other side of the ha-ha. Mr. Piper insisted on having American boAvls for himself and his particular friends, in an old-fashioned garden on one side of the big square mansion, comfortably shut in by a dense holly hedge, a retreat where a man might smoke a clay pipe and be A7ulgar at his ease. The Wigzells and their compeers aU came in handsome carriages, and, if the men Avere some what given to eccentricity in their hats and collars, the Avonien all dressed in the latest fashion. But their highest claim to Bella's favour was the fact that they brought very pleasant people in their train ; officers in the regiment stationed at Great Yafford, clever young barristers, lawyers of higher standing than the starched solicitors Avho had retired to cultivate their roses and air their self-importance in the pastoral seclusion of Little Yafford. Bella"], [164, "156 AN OPEN A7ERDICT. perceived with delight that even these manufac turing people could be useful to her. By midsummer, Mrs. Piper's Thursday after noons, Avhich had at first been such dire failures as to provoke the sarcasms of Miss Coyle and her set, had become so successful that Miss Coyle now found herself a neglected atom in the croAvd, and sat apart Avith one of her chosen friends, breathing condemnations of this neAV phase of worldliness and frivolity. Miss Coyle liked the strong tea, and unlimited pound cake, the claret cup, and straAvberries and cream, and better still did she like the large opportunity for scandal which these gatherings afforded her. ' Poor dear Mrs. Piper,' she sighed, meaning the lady reposing under the sumptuous monument of manyr-coloured marbles.

' It Avas bad enough in the first Mrs. Piper's time, though there never Avas a more careful housekeeper. I've heard her lament it many a day. What must it be noav ?' Miss Coyle opened her eyes very Avide as she uttered this aAvful question, and poor little Mrs. Namby, Avho always agreed with everybody, but wished harm to nobody, opened hers in sympathy. ' Ah ! ' she sighed. ' She's very young, isn't she ? You can't expect mucli carefulness from such a pretty young thing as that.' ' Pretty }7oung thing, indeed,' cried Miss Coyle, contemptuously. ' We've all been pretty young things in our da)'.' This Avas an assertion which, taken in conjunction with Miss Coyle's present physiognomy, Avas rather difficult to beheve. ' But did that absolve us from doing our duty ? Would that have excused us if Ave'd been given over to dress, and dissipation, and ' here Miss Coyle made a long and solemn pause ' flirtation ? ' ' Oh,' cried poor Mrs. Namby, almost jumping off"], [166, "158 AN OPEN VERDICT. her garden chair, ' pray don't say that. I hope Mrs. Piper has too much respect for herself as a young married Avoman to be guilty of flirtation.' ' I say nothing,' replied Miss Coyle. ' Look at that, and judge for yourself, Mrs. Namby.' ' That ' Avas as pretty a living picture of light hearted youth as a painter of modern manners need hav7e cared to paint. Against the green background of beech boughs, bright Avith their midsummer shoots, upon a carpet of velvet sward, stood two figures apart from the rest of the revellers \u2014 a man in gray, tall, Avell made, good-looking ; a woman in an archery dress of Lincoln green, setting off a form slight and delicate enough for one of Diana's nymphs, a hat and feather, a la Eosalind, poised lightly on her burnished auburn hair, neat little hands in tan gauntlets, and a tall bow that became her as a fan becomes an Andalusian. The man in gray was Captain Standish, the crack captain in the crack regiment then stationed at Great Yafford. The regiment considered itself a great deal too good for Great Yafford, and the captain con sidered himself too good for the regiment. He was"], [167, "CAPTAIN STANDISH. 159 a man of good family ; he had large means, a hand some face, and a fine figure ; he had come off first in all athletic exercises at school and college ; he had not learnt anything else in particular \u2014 or in his own words he had not 'gone in for ' anything else ; he left it to be inferred that he could have taken honours had he so chosen. The lady in Lincoln green was Mrs. Piper the second. She had instituted these archery meetings for her own pleasure as well as that of her friends, but she had not yet learned to hit the gold. The three taU Miss Porkmans had been beating her ignominiously in this afternoon's contest. Captain Standish had taken her in hand, and was giving her a lesson in the management of her bow. ' Well, really noAv I can't see auy harm,' said Mrs. Namby. ' He's ghdng her a lesson, don't you see ? She's a poor hand with a bow and arrows.' Miss Coyle gave a prolonged sniff. ' Mr. Piper may approve of such goings on,' she said. ' I don't think I should, if I were in his place. Look at him bending down to speak to her, and look at her, giggling and blushing like a silly school girl."], [168, "160 AN OPEN VERDICT. If you don't call thai' flirting the Avord must have a different meaning from what it had in my time.' The jerk of Miss Coyle's bonnet seemed to imply that she had done her share of flirting in the days that Avere no more, and Avas an acute judge of such matters. Mrs. Namby looked at her Avith aAve, marvelling what valiant knight of an extinct chivalry could ever have had the courage to flirt with Miss Coyle. 'You really must let me ride over some morning and give you a good long lesson. It excruciates me. to see those three Porkman Gorgons getting the best of it in this way.' That was what Captain Standish Avas bending doAvn to say, with that air of grave reverence which from the distance looked tender. He was not brilliant in conversation. His talent had all gone into field sports and manly accomplishments, from foxhunting, hammer-throAving, cricket, billiards \u2014 doAvn to skittles. He could give any man odds at aU these. It was astonishing what respect he Avon from his felloAv-men on account of this gift. Had he been a second NeAvton or Herschel, he could not have"], [169, "161 CAPTAIN STANDISH. carried things with a higher hand, or more ke.mly felt his superiority to the ruck of mankind. Then, again, he had that calm sense of ascendency which distinguishes the man who has never been in want of money. You can see it in his looks. There is the tranquil arrogance of a being Avho has never shivered at the rap of a dun, or quailed at opening a lawyer's letter, or been politely reminded by his banker that his account is overdrawn. ' You must reaUy allow me to teach you,' pleaded Captain Standish. ' I used to win prizes at this kind of thing when I was a lad.' His words were humble enough, but his tone meant, ' You ought to be intensely grateful for my condescension in offering you such a privilege.' It was Captain Standish's first appearance at Little Yafford Park, and Bella was fluttered by the triumph of getting him there \u2014 at last. His brother officers had come very often, from the blue-nosed colonel to the caUow cornets, and had eaten and drunken and been jolly with Mr. Piper, and voted the whole establishment ' capital fun.' But Captain Standish was a different order of being, and never VOL. III. M"], [170, "162 AN OPEN VERDICT. Avent anywhere till he had made people sensible of his importance and exclusiveness, by holding himself aloof. The Miss Porkmans and the Miss Wigzells were rarely seen without one of the callow cornets in their train. Mr. Porkman was on the most familiar terms with Colonel O'Shaughnessy, the blue-nosed commanding officer, who liked the Pork man cellar and the Porkman cook, and was not too refined to tolerate the Porkmans themselves. But Captain Standish was not to be had so easily. Cooks and cellars Avere indifferent to him. He affected a Spartan simplicity in his diet \u2014 drank only the driest champagne, and that seldom \u2014 dined on a slice of mutton and a tumbler of Vichy water, frankly avowed his abhorrence of provincial dinner parties, refused five invitations out of six, and, after accepting the sixth, disappointed his host at the eleventh hour. Can it be wondered that, in a society of newly rich provincials, Captain Standish was eminently popular ? His dog-cart, severely painted darkest olive, black harness, no plating, high-stepping brown horse, neat groom in olive livery, and unexceptionable boots,"], [171, "163 CAPTAIN STANDISH. plain black hat and cockade, made a sensation whenever it appeared in the High Street, or flashed meteor-like past the broad plate glass windoAvs of the villas on the London road. Bella had heard of Captain Standish, both from his brother officers and from the outside world, until she knew his excellences and accomplishments by heart. She was inspired with the same desire to cultivate his acquaintance which agitated feminine society in the brand-new Granges, Moats, and Manors round Great Yafford. The Porkmans had met him at a fancy baU, where he had stood out from the tinselled King Charleses, and the spangled Black Princes, and the theatrical brigands and troubadours, in the actual dress of a Spanish bull fighter. He had once accepted an invitation to dine at the Porkmans', had disappointed them at the last moment, and had called a week after. The Miss Porkmans had forgiven the ungracious disappoint ment on account of the gracious caU. ' He looks lovely in morning dress,' said Blanche Porkman, who was youthful and enthusiastic. ' If you knew him you would rave about him.'"], [172, "164 AN OPEN VERDICT. ' I never rave about people,' returned Bella, with dignity. ' And I don't in the least care about knowing this Captain Standish.' ' This Captain Standish ! ' echoed Blanche Pork man, indignantly. ' You needn't put a demonstrative pronoun before him, Mrs. Piper. There's nobody else like him.' In spite of her affected indifference, Bella was bent upon bringing Captain Standish to the Park. He had called upon the Porkmans. Was she \u2014 with her advanced ideas of elegance and her unlimited capa city for reading French novels \u2014 to be of less account than the Porkmans ? Was that overgrown Blanche, with her drab hair and complexion, and goggle eyes, to boast of an acquaintance beyond Bella's reach? ' The next time you come, colonel, you must bring Captain Standish,' said Mrs. Piper to the cordial O'Shaughnessy, after that gentleman had dined copiously at Mr. Piper's expense, and told aU his tiger stories, in Avhich he was apt to lose the tiger in a jumble of irrelevant parentheses. 'Madam, if I live and he lives till next Thurs day, Standish shall do homage at the shrine of"], [173, "165 CAPTAIN STANDISH. beauty and domestic excellence,' protested the colonel, Avhich was merely his Avay of saying that Captain Standish should come to see Mrs. Piper. The following Thursday came, but no Standish. Another and another Thursday, and the colonel still appeared, apologetic and disgusted. That fellow Standish was perfectly incorrigible, he declared. But this was the fourth Thursday, and Captain Standish Avas here. 'Madam,' said the colonel, introducing his junior, ' I have kept my promise. If this fellow had tried to put me off to-day I should haAre lugged him here by the hair of his head.' ' And if I had known how charming \u2014 a place I was to see, I should have come ages ago Avithout your interference, colonel,' said the captain. There was a break in the sentence, a look in the captain's eyes that said in plainest language, \u2022' If I had knoAvn what a lovely woman I was to see, &c, &c.' And BeUa, having lately graduated in the novels of Charles de Bernard, thoroughly understood the look and tone. Mr. Piper also Avas gratified by Captain Stand-"], [174, "166 AN OPEN VERDICT. ish's visit. His friend Timperley had bragged of his familiarity with the captain ; bis friend Pork man had boasted of the captain's morning call. Mr. Piper did not wish to be behind those compeers of his. He had felt himself at a disadvantage when they were lauding the all-accomplished Standish. ' Well, Beller, my love,' he said, Avhen the guests had aU departed, and he sat down to a te*te-a-tete dinner Avith his Avife, who Avas quite exhausted by the cares and triumphs of the afternoon. ' I'm glad we've had Captain Standish at one of our Thursdays, since people round Great Yafford think such a lot about him ; but I don't see that he's anything so Avonderful. He's very much like all the other mili tary men I've seen \u2014 extra well got-up linen \u2014 a neat cut boot- \u2014 and hair cropped as close as a convick's. That's the general pattern, I take it.' ' Oh, Mr Piper ! ' cried Bella, horrified at this blasphemy. ' Can't you see Captain Standish's supe riority ? There is a style \u2014 an air \u2014 &je ne sais quoi! 'I don't know about the junnysaker, but I'll allow that his clothes are a good cut,' said the unim pressionable Piper. 'But why the dickens do the"], [175, "167 CAPTAIN STANDISH. Porkmans and Timperleys think so much of him ? I shouldn't have thought he was old Timperley's sort.' ' My dear Mr. Piper, Captain Standish is the fashion.' ' Oh, that's it, is it ? ' said Mr. Piper, meekly. ' Well, I , like to be in the fashion as well as my neighbours. Suppose we ask Captain Thingamy to dinner ? He's not the sort of chap that would want to borrow money of one, is he, by-the-bye ? It's a way they've got in the army.' ' Captain Standish borrow money ! ' cried Bella. ' Why his mother is Lady Emmeline Standish .' ' That wouldn't fill his pockets,' interjected Mr. Piper. ' And his father is a partner in a great bank. I forget which, but some enormously rich bank. The Porkmans know all about it.' ' Oh, well, if his father is rich, he may come here as often as he likes. I'm not afraid of a rich man ; but your needy felloAvs are always dangerous. They're like the serpent that warms itself at your hearth, and then stings you. They eat your dinners, and wind up by getting you to put your name to an accommodation bill.'"], [176, "CHAPTEE XII. AT HER CHARIOT WHEELS. Captain Standish did not wait to be asked to dinner. He made his appearance at Little Yafford Park Avithin a feAv days of his first visit. This time he rode over, and his hack was a thing to Avonder at. ' I'm blest if he ain't the first bit of horseflesh we've had inside these stables ! ' exclaimed Mr. Piper's coachman, who affected to despise the pair of bays for which his master had given three hundred guineas. Mr. Piper was enjoying himself among his friends at Great Yafford. There was a club in that commercial town, at which Mr. Timperley and Mr. Porkman and their associates assembled daily to read the newspapers and discuss the money market. They were all strong politicians, and talked of politics as well as of the Stock Exchange, but they contemplated all public events from one"], [177, "169 AT HER CHARIOT WHEELS. standpoint. What would be the effect on the money market ? How Avould this crisis in France, or this artful move on the part of Eussia, or this pretty piece of business at Vienna affect the demand for cotton? Would Palmerston's last great speech steady the price of consols ? Mr. Piper went to his club oftener now-a-days than he had gone in the first Mrs. Piper's time. BeUa was making him a man of fashion, as he complained sometimes, Avith a fatuous delight in his young Avife's frivolities. She would drive him into Great Yafford in her pony carriage in the morning, do an hour's shopping at Banbury's, or get a neAV novel at the circulating library, and fetch him in the afternoon in her barouche, after making two or three calls on the commercial aris tocracy ; for A\\7hat is the use of having fine clothes, if you cannot show them to somebody, or a carriage and pair if you cannot keep it standing before somebody's door ? Bella heartily despised the Porkmans, Timperleys, Wigzells, and all their set; but she was by nature an actress, and must have a stage and an audience of some kind."], [178, "170 AN OPEN VERDICT. Thus it happened that Mr. Piper was at his club, and that Bella received Captain Standish alone. It was a lovely afternoon, the lawn was steeped in sunshine, the flower-beds were almost too dazzling to be looked at, the roses were in their midsummer glory. Bella received her visitor in the garden. She Avas fond of sitting out of doors. She liked to see the Avidth and grandeur of her domain, the fallow deer grouped gracefully in the distance, the cool shadows of beech and oak, the tall elms yonder Avhere the rooks had buUt for the last century. Perhaps she knew that she looked her prettiest in the garden, sitting in a Ioav basket chair, in the shade of spreading lime branches. It was just the afternoon for archery. There was not a breath of wind to blow the arrows about. The noble old beeches shaded the long stretch of sward where the targets had been set up, and made it possible for an enthusiastic toxophilite to endure the midsummer heat. Bella made quite light of it. 'I adore the summer,' she said, A\\7hen Captain Standish expressed his fear that she might find"], [179, "171 AT HER CHARIOT WHEELS. archery too great an exertion, with the thermometer at seventy-five in the shade. 'I think I must belong to the cat famUy, I so enjoy basking in the sun.' ' So do I,' said the captain, who looked as fresh and cool as if he had just come out of a Avater-cure establishment ; ' and I detest the people who go about the world mopping themselves and grumbling at the heat on every decent summer day.' Bella blushed. Mr. Piper had an unpleasant way of mopping his face with a broAvn and yellow bandanna on Avarm afternoons. She felt that there must be many habits of his that Avould jar on Captain Standish's nerves, if ever they came to be intimate. The lesson was delightful. The captain was a first-rate master, and after about an hour's hard work Bella's arrows began to fly straight to the target, instead of taking a slanting direction and losing themseh'es under the beeches. This was something gained. Once she went within half an inch of the gold. And then, w7hen her arm began to ache desperately and she Avas obliged to give up,"], [180, "172 AN OPEN VERDICT. Captain Standish took her bow, and in the easiest way in the world, just like that famous marksman who drew his bow at a venture, shot three arrows in the gold, in the neatest little triangle. ' I could write my name on the target,' he said. ' It's the simplest thing in life when you're used to it.' Bella looked at her watch. Half-past four o'clock. How the afternoon had flown ! She had promised to call for her husband at his club, and the carriage had been ordered for four. She ex plained her engagement to Captain Standish, who apologized for having detained her so long. ' I was so pleased with your progress that I forgot all about time,' he said. ' May I come to morroAv \u2014 a little earlier ? I want you to beat the Miss Porkmans next Thursday. You wiU be shoot ing on Thursday, I suppose ? ' ' Yes, I dare say, if they come. I find archery a great relief on my Thursday afternoons. It is some thing for people to do. There is so little to talk about in the country. You must find it very trying, Captain Standish.'"], [181, "AT HER CHARIOT WHEELS. 173 The captain shrugged his shoulders. 'I'm used to country quarters,' he said. 'And then in the very depths of B\u0153otia there are always bright exceptions. But candidly, I don't care much for what people call society. I like to choose my friends, and when I have chosen them I am an enthusiast in friendship. Now pray put on your bonnet, and don't let Mr. Piper be kept waiting through my indiscretion in staying so long. l'U go round to the stable for my horse. May I ride beside your carriage part of the way, if I don't make too much dust ? ' Bella blushed and sparkled at the idea. To have this fine flower of the army, this glass of fashion and mould of form riding beside her barouche was an honour to boast of when next she met the Porkmans. He had never ridden at their chariot wheels. C\u00e6sar's triumph when he brought home Vercingetorix was not grander than this. Bella leaned back in her carriage, holding up the daintiest lace-flounced parasol, just big enough to shelter the tip of her nose, Avhile the captain's sleek bay trotted at her side, and arched his neck,"], [182, "174 AN OPEN VERDICT. and sniffed the air, and gave himself resentful airs at being forced to suit his pace to the jog-trot of the over-fed carriage horses. They passed along the village street, under the cloudless blue, and Bella felt that the eye of the world \u2014 her little world \u2014 was upon them. Miss Coyle was clipping her solitary standard rose tree as they went by, and stopped, scissors in hand, to stare at them. Cyril Culverhouse Avas just coming out of his garden gate, with a black book under his arm. Clementina and Flora Scratchell were flattening their noses against the parlour window as usual. That vision of sisterly noses always greeted Bella as she passed. This time she took care to be looking another way. She did not want Captain Standish to knoAV that her ' people ' lived in the shabbiest house in the village.

Sometimes he dropped behind"], [183, "175 AT HER CHARIOT WHEELS. and walked his horse for a mile or so, and then startled BeUa by descending upon her suddenly from some grassy height, fresh and cool, and riding with a rein as light as a silken thread. ' What a loA7ely horse that is ! ' exclaimed Bella. ' He seems able to do anything.' ' He Avas able to throAv most of his riders before I got him,' answered the captain ; ' but he's tame enough now.' There AA7as a roU in the animal's eye, and a liberal display of white, Avhich went far to confirm this account of bis antecedents. Captain Standish was riding beside the carriage Avhen they entered that newly-buUt suburb where the plutocracy of Great Yafford had built their habitations. They passed the Porkmans' Grange, with its red waUs, Tudor casements, and impossible gables, the Timperley Manor House, with its Norman sugar-loaf towers, and the Wigzells' Italian Gothic Villa, all white stucco, terraced walks and scar let geraniums. BeUa, like C\u00e6sar, felt that her triumph Avas complete. Captain Standish only left her at the door of the club-house."], [184, "176 AN OPEN VERDICT, ' Well, Uttle Avoinan,' cried Mr. Piper, Avhen he came tumbling into the barouche, with his white beaver hat at the back of his head, and his brown and yellow bandanna on active service. ' You haven't kept me waiting \u2014 no, not at all, neither.' Bella told him all about Captain Standish's visit. She was radiant with this smaU social success. ' Didn't I tell you that I'd introduce you into tip-top society, old Avoman ? ' exclaimed Mr. Piper. ' You shall hold your own with the best of 'em. I'll spare no expense tiil I see you at the top of the tree. We must give a dinner party next week, and we'll have Timperley, and WigzeU, and the Avhole boiling.' ' Captain Standish is always meeting them at Great Yafford. Don't you think we'd better ask the Dulcimers \u2014 and some of the Little Yafford people?' suggested Bella. ' Well, have it your own way, my dear. I like to have the Vicar's legs under my mahogany. It looks respectable.' BeUa sent out her invitations for that day fort night, carefully excluding the manufacturing element."], [185, "177 AT HER CHARIOT AVHEELS. She impressed on Mr. Piper that he Avas to give no accidental invitations. His impulsive hospitality must not be aUowed to spoil this particular party, as in Bella's opinion, at least, it had spoUed previous parties, by the interpolation of ineligible guests. ' Above all things let there be no Mr. Chumney,' said BeUa, authoritatively. ' Chumney's enjoying himself at Whitby,' re plied Mr. Piper, ' and don't Avant to be beholden to you for a dinner ; but if you expect me to forget that Chumney's father was the first man that ever gave me a week's wages, you'll find yourself disap pointed. I'd take a knife and cut my heart out, if I thought it Avas capable of such base ingratitude.' ' You may remember Mr. Chumney's father as much as you like, but you needn't always be talking of him, and of the time when you were glad to earn twelve shillings a week,' remonstrated Bella.

He shoots and hunts a great deal, they say, but doesn't care for balls or parties.' ' I think he wiU come,' said Bella.

He rode over to answer her note in person ; and to give her another lesson in archery. This time Clementina was with her and shared in the lesson. Captain Standish had no objection to teach two pretty girls instead of one, but he preferred Mrs. Piper, as the prettier and more fascinating of the two. She possessed a great superiority too, in his eyes, as a married woman. It was the rule of this great man's life, when he condescended to flirtation, to flirt with a married Avoman. No harm could come of it to himself. There was always the risk of the husband being made uncomfortable ; but that Avas a detail. Captain Standish Avas not afraid of making a husband jealous, or even unhappy ; but he Avas very much afraid of compromising himself by flirtation Avith a single Avoman, who might be absurd enough"], [192, "184 AN OPEN VERDICT. to expect him to marry her, and whose friends might make themselves disagreeable if he declined to do so. He was therefore the very last man to walk into the silken snare that Mrs. Dulcimer had set for him. He was kind and courteous to Clementina, Avho Avas ready to ' worship him ' or to ' rave about him ' \u2014 in the Porkman phraseology \u2014 at a moment's notice ; but he reserved his tender attentions, his thrilling looks and lowered tones, for Bella, for whom the sweet poison, the social deadly nightshade of an unprin cipled man's flatteries had already too great a charm. Of the extent of the captain's influence over her mind Bella herself was not yet aAvare. Indeed, she believed herself hardened against any such influence by the counter poison of a previous love. She had loved once, and loA7ed unhappily, and therefore could never love again. This she firmly believed, and, secure in this belief, Avalked blindfold into danger. Her pleasure in the captain's society she ascribed to the triumph of parading him before the astonished eyes of Little Yafford, the delight of lording it over the Porkmans, the fact that Captain Standish Avas the fashion."], [193, "185 PLAYING WITH FIRE.

' I have not seen him particularly attentive to her.' ' Perhaps not, but he has been particularly atten tive to you. He would naturally begin in that way.' Bella was not quite clear upon this point; she had little faith in Mrs. Dulcimer's judgment. Were not the most miserable hours of her life, her one inexcus able sin, referable to that lady's mistake ?

Mrs. Dulcimer was so elated at the prospect of another brilliant match, to be brought about by her agency, that, toAvards the end of the evening, she took Mr. Piper into her confidence. 'Charming man, Captain Standish, isn't he ?' she asked. ' I've 'eard that remark made a good many times, mum,' he ansAvered, candidly, 'but as far as my individual opinion goes I don't see anything remark able about the captain that should single him out from the ruck of military men.

' That's just according to her feelings. But it's no business of mine to find husbands for my Avife's sisters.' This Avas disheartening, but Mrs. Dulcimer was not going to renounce her project because Mr. Piper looked coldly upon it. Clementina stayed at the Park, and Bella enriched her Avith a great many dresses and other adornments of Avhich she was beginning to be tired, or which Avere of a fashion that had become too general for a fine lady's Avcar. Generosity in a person of Bella's stamp is only another word for extravagance. Bella would have as soon contemplated cutting off"], [196, "188 AN OPEN VERDICT. her right hand as giving away anything she wanted herself. These gifts to Tina necessitated the pur- chase of neAV things, and already the second Mrs. Piper had begun to get into debt, and to feel that she had bills which must be paid next year, or at some more definite period. The three hundred a year which Mr. Piper had settled upon her in the fulness of his heart, as an all-sufficing income for dress and pocket money, was not nearly enough to supply the manifold wants of a young woman avIio had been brought up in poverty.

Mr. Piper had not forgotten Mrs. Dulcimer's ideas about Captain Standish and Clementina, and Avhen he saw the captain and sister-in-law together he was inclined to believe that there might be some foundation for that inveterate matchmaker's fancy. The captain had a knack of being particularly attentive to Tina under Mr. Piper's eye.

And then Captain Standish went on to tell his story; the old, old story, the familiar melody, subject to such endless variations, such kaleidoscopic dis tinctions without difference, and always coming to the same thing in the end. ' We might have been happy had Providence willed it. Let us defy Provi dence, fling honour to the winds, and be happy in spite of fate.'

But you are not generous enough to give your self to the man you love.' He had let go her hand, and was walking with long quick steps backwards and forwards across the deep bay, like a lion in a cage.

' They are as good as most of the prize poems it has been my lot to read,' he said, after he had con scientiously gone through Emmanuel's little collection of manuscript verses, ' but then you see a prize poem is generally the flattest thing in life.

'No, sir, there ain't none for you,' replied Sparkes ; ' but there's a letter for you, Mr. Culver house, from Indy.' Kenrick had written then, after all, thought Cyril, moved at the idea. Distance and lapse of time had softened the natural bitterness of his feelings. And then and there, in deliberate defiance of the postal rules and regulations, Sparkes handed the curate a thin miserable-looking letter, in a black edged envelope, addressed by a strange hand. The Vicar and Cyril both looked at it, horror- struck. 'Your cousin has been killed,' cried Mr. Dulcimer."], [219, "A TURN OF FORTUNE'S WHEEL. 211 CyrU felt the same apprehension.

This was some kind of consolation to Cyril, Avho thought of his cousin with a remorseful grief that was very real. And now, when those first days of mourning for the dead were over, he began to think of his own position, which was full of perplexity. Kenrick's death had made him master of Culverhouse Castle.

The Park had been an important source of Mr. Namby's income, in the late Mrs. Piper's time, and he did not want the doors to be shut upon him now, so he smiled his most sym pathetic smUe, and gave a gentle sigh ; the smile to re-assure, the sigh to express fore-knowledge of every evil the Fates had in store for his patient ; and then he put his two fingers gently upon Bella's Avrist, looking at his Avatch the while, as if a beat more or less in the minute were a matter of supreme importance.

Mr. Piper happened to be in a particularly good humour. He had been speculating a little, by way of amusement, in woollen goods, and his venture had turned up trumps. He opened a bottle of his best champagne for Mr. Namby, a rose-tinted wine, that creamed and sparkled gently in the shallow glass, and did not run over in fooUsh froth, like ginger beer. Mr. Namby took some curried lobster, and a mutton cutlet, and the breast of a partridge, and a bit of Harrogate cheese, and a bunch of Mr. Piper's famous Alexandria Muscats, which had cost a smaU fortune to grow, and he had a very fair share of the rose-tinted champagne; and after being thus regaled, he declared, Avith conviction,"], [231, "223 MR.

This appropriation of Bella's carriage and ponies was an act of self-assertion on his part, and was meant as a kind of manifesto. He felt that the time had come when he must be master.

How fast the leaves were falling, how dull and cold everything looked. Yes, assuredly Summer had gone. He had hardly noticed it till now. He loitered at his club while the ponies were being rested and fed, and contrived to be home rather late for dinner. He expected black looks from Bella when he went into the drawing-room, where she was waiting, daintily dressed, with the unfailing novel open in her lap ; but to his surprise she received him as pleasantly as if nothing had happened. This mollified him, and he made no further attempt at self-assertion that evening. ' I hope you didn't want your ponies, little woman,' he said. ' I took 'em.' ' My ponies,' laughed BeUa.

Having gained her point, and secured the promise of a saddle-horse, Bella wasted no time in getting herself ready to ride him. She was far too wise a little woman to exhibit herself publicly on horseback, before she had learned how to ride. She drove to Great Yafford early next morning, was measured for a habit by the best tailor in the town, and from the tailor's went to a riding school in the suburbs, where the daughters of the plutocracy learned to sit straight in their saddles, and to take desperate leaps over a pole two feet from the tan floor. Here Mrs. Piper arrived early enough to attire herself in a borrowed riding-habit, and to get an hour's private lesson before the daily class began.

'Is it very long, ma'am ?' asked the master, with a view to the selection of an animal of exceptional docility. ' Well, yes,' said Bella, who, in her present stage of being, had never ridden anything more dangerous than a wooden rocking-horse. ' It is rather a long time.' ' Tame Cat,' roared the master to his subordinate, and in about five minutes a horse of nondescript appearance \u2014 the kind of animal which seems to be grown on purpose for riding-masters and flymen \u2014 a creature with a straight neck, splay feet, and a rat tail, but gifted with an expression of patient longsuffering which, from a moral point of view, atoned for his want of beauty. Bella was mounted on Tame Cat, the master mounted a tall ugly chestnut with a white blaze on his face, and the two horses began to circumambulate the barn-like building at a solemn walk. Then came the exciting canter, and then the mathematical trot,"], [240, "232 AN OPEN VERDICT. which was for first too much for even Bella's natural aptitude at doing everything she particularly wanted to do. At the end of the hour, however, there was a marked improvement, and the master complimented his neAV pupil. ' You were a good deal out of practice, ma'am,' he said, 'but you'll get into it again nicely in a dozen lessons.' ' I- shall come every morning for a week,' said Bella, ' and you must teach me as much as you can in the shortest possible time. Suppose I were to take a double lesson, two hours instead of one.' 'You might find it too fatiguing.' ' I don't mind fatigue a bit,' answered Bella, curiously forgetful of her depressed state of health. ' I shaU take a two hours' lesson to-morrow. But, remember, you are not to tell anybody about my coming here. It seems so foolish for a person of my age to be taking riding lessons.' * Lor ' bless your heart, ma'am, there's ladies that come here old enough to be your grandmother. You should see them go round in the canter, with their poor old elbows waggling.'"], [241, "233 CAPTAIN STANDISH CHOOSES A HORSE. For six days BeUa pursued this secret course of instruction. She contrived to have particular busi ness in Great Yafford every morning. Once she went to carry a hamper of good things to the dear giris at Miss Turk's, twice to her dressmaker, once to her mUliner, once to change books at the library, once to make an early call upon Mrs. Wigzell. Mr. Piper accompanied her sometimes, but she dropped him at his club, and he in no way interfered with her liberty. At the end of the week the habit was sent home from the tailor's, and Bella had learned to ride. She had jumped the pole success fully at its greatest altitude, and it seemed to her simple soul that there was nothing she could not achieve in the huntiug-field. She had seamed to sit straight, to keep her right shoulder back, to trot easily round a corner. The riding-master dismissed her with an assurance that she was a first-rate horse woman, which he could very well afford to do, as she had paid him a guinea a lesson and made him a present at parting. ' If you really mean me to have a horse, Mr. Piper, I think Captain Standish would be kind"], [242, "234 AN OPEN VERDICT. enough to choose one for me. You knoAv what a judge he is.'

It wUl be my money that '11 have to pay for it, not Captain Standish's.' ' My dear Mr. Piper, horses are so out of your line. You might choose some big clumsy creature \u2014 very handsome in his way, no doubt, like the Flemish dray horses, but quite unsuited for me. And you know when you bought the bays you never noticed the splint in Juno's fore-leg.' ' It wasn't my business,' growled Mr. Piper. ' I paid for a vet's opinion.' ' Precisely, and got cheated in spite of him. Now Captain Standish is not like a veterinary surgeon. He'll get no commission. You had better let him choose a horse for me.' * Well, my dear, if you like him to do so I've no objection. I've promised you a horse, and I won't go from my bargain. Come, I'U tell you what I'll do.

If he's clever enough to get a good horse for seventy five, you can spend the difference on a new gown. You're never tired of getting new gowns.' Mr. Piper wrote the cheque and went his way, with a mind untainted by jealousy. He trusted this pretty young wife of his with the guardianship of his honour, as implicitly as he had trusted homely middle aged Mrs. Piper the first. He knew that Bella was not faultless. He was far from feeling perfect satis faction with all her ways. He knew that she was spending his money like water. But the hideous idea that she could dishonour him, were it only in thought, had not yet poisoned his peace. The cheque was written on a Thursday, and in the afternoon Captain Standish appeared among the commercial aristocracy who now recognised Mrs. Piper's Thursday afternoons as a pleasant way of wasting a couple of hours, airing their self-import ance, and exercising their carriage horses. ' Has Piper consented to your hunting this season ? ' asked the captain, eagerly. He was just so much in love as to feel that the"], [244, "236 AN OPEN VERDICT. hunting-field would be an arid waste without Bella. ' He has consented to my riding, and he has given me a hundred pounds to buy a horse. Here is the cheque, and if you really don't mind the trouble of choosing one ' ' You shall have the handsomest horse in York- shire,' said the captain, putting the cheque in his waistcoat pocket. ' But a hundred pounds won't be enough for that, will it ? ' asked Bella. ' One hears of such extra- vagant prices being given for horses now-a-days.' ' It will be quite enough, as I shaU manage.' ' Ah, you are so clever about horse-flesh. Our coachman says the horses you ride are something wonderful.' ' I don't ride screws,' said the captain, with a well-satisfied air. He had a lofty pity for the poor creatures who had to ride anything they could get, and be thankful, and to dress themselves respectably upon something under that eight hundred a year which Brummel declared to be the lowest amount upon which a gentleman could clothe himself."], [245, "CAPTAIN STANDISH CHOOSES A HORSE. 237 Early in the next week Bella received a little note from the captain, written at one of his London clubs.

However, she was full of pride at the idea of having a horse of such dis tinguished beauty, and of being able to lord it over the Miss Porkmans, who were very proud of their horsemanship, and very fond of talking about their hairbreadth 'scapes and ventures, and how they had taken it out of their horses, which, according to their own account, were of a very wild and dangerous breed. Bella had no doubt she would be able to take it out of the black. She was glad he was black. There is something so common about a bay. She could hardly rest tUl Thursday morning came. She went half-a-dozen times tc the stables to see that the black's loose box was properly prepared, with its fringes and decorations of plaited straw, and all the newest improvements in stable fittings. She was walking up and down the broad gravel drive in front of the portico, when the captain appeared, riding his handsome chestnut, followed by a groom, who led a creature so clothed and knee-capped and hooded, that nothing was visible but checked kerseymere. He appeared, furthermore, to have a monstrous hump, which gave him the appearance of a Bactrian camel"], [247, "239 CAPTAIN STANDISH CHOOSES A HORSE. ' I should have ridden him over myself, but I Avould not bring him to you with the dust of the road upon him,' said the captain, dismounting, and shaking hands, a lingering hand-shake with a tender little pressure at the end. ' Now, Dobbs, off with the clothes.' The black was stripped in a minute or two, and stood before them in all his beauty, a glossy-coated, thoroughbred, finely moulded creature, with a back ward roll of his fuU eye, and an alert movement of his delicate ear, common to horses of his high breeding. ' Isn't he perfect ? ' asked the captain, contem plating his purchase with the eye of pride. 'He is lovely, and I don't know how to thank you,' answered Bella, watching the black's restless eyebaU ; ' but isn't he dreadfully high-spirited ? You knoAV I don't pretend to be a Diana Vernon.' ' You could not do anything badly if you tried,' said the captain. ' Don't be alarmed. Erebus has a lovely temper.

' No, I think it's rather a good name,' answered Bella, patting Erebus's velvet nose, a Uberty which he endured with perfect affabUity. ' It isn't common.' The Miss Porkmans' horses were caffed Prince and Daisy. The cause of the hump-fike appearance which had puzzled Bella was a very handsome side-saddle of quUted doeskin \u2014 quite the perfection of a saddle. ' I ventured to have him measured for a saddle directly I decided on buying him for you,' explained the captain. ' The saddlers had to work day and night to get it finished by yesterday evening.

She had forgotten nothing. Captain Standish lifted her iuto the saddle, gave her the reins, and then mounted by her side. They Avalked quietly to the stretch of turf, and then and there, the instant he felt the grass under his hoofs, Erebus bolted Avith his light burden. She sat him splendidly, feeling as if her last hour were come. After making a Avild circuit of a mile or so, he consented to be pulled up, and stood looking the image of innocence, Avhen Captain Standish rode sloAvly up to him.

Anything beyond that was out of his line. He contemplated the black Avith a cool survey, and thought that there was very little of him for the money. ' Isn't he lovely ?

Bella thought it would not be altogether incon venient \u2014 nay, it would be very convenient \u2014 to have Vanessa Porkman for her companion. With Vanessa riding on her left side, Captain Standish might ride on her right, Avithout gh7ing occasion for scandal. She Avas not at all afraid of Vanessa being scandalized by anything she saAv or heard. The second Miss Porkman Avas so far in advance of her age, that she had in a manner anticipated all the feminine fastness of the nineteenth century. The skating rink, the ladies' club of the future, con tained nothing calculated to shock Vanessa. Miss Porkman accepted Mrs. Piper's invitation gladly. She OAvned with a charming candour that she Avas always glad to get away from home.

Miss Porkman came. She Avas a florid young Avoman, Avith bold broAvn eyes, an affectation of short sight, an eye-gfass, and an insatiable thirst for mascu line society. Contemplated from an abstract ethnolo gical point of view, she Avas a remarkably interesting example of the depth of deterioration to which the Avomanly character can descend among the Avelf-to do classes ; but she was an excruciating young Avoman to live with. In her mind the business of a Avoman's life was flirtation. To be admired, to agitate the hearts of men, to lure the luckless Strephon from his legiti mate Chloe, these things, in Miss Porkman's mind, constituted woman's mission. She AA7as net strong minded, she Avas no eager reformer, she didn't care tAvopence about universal suffrage ; but she wanted"], [258, "250 AN OPEN VERDICT. to be the Cleopatra of her small world, to have C\u00e6sar, and Pompey, and Antonius, and the young Augustus, and every man of them subjugated and adoring. She had unlimited confidence in her own good looks, and a scornful pity for plain Avomen, with Avhom nobody cared to flirt. The fair Vanessa had tried her hardest to en tangle Captain Standish in those flowery chains Avhich she kept in stock for all eligible victims, but the captain had not alloAved himself to be bound. She had seen with disgust that he was a constant guest at the Park, and that he lavished upon BeUa those attentions which she had herself unsuccessfully invited. To flirt Avith a married Avoman was in Miss Porkman's eyes not so much immoral as it Avas cowardly. She Avould have excused the immorality, but she could not forgive the cowardice.

Captain Standish came every day, and rode every day on the moor Avith Bella and Miss Porkman. He taught Bella how to manage the black.and he was sufficiently atten tive to Vanessa to keep that young lady in perpetual good humour with herself and him. Bella's pluck, which Avas undeniable, made up in a great measure for her want of experience.

He praised the black, and thanked the captain for buying that accomplished animal.

' My dear, you are letting that horrid Miss Porkman cut out poor Clementina,' she complained. ' This visit of hers Avill quite spoil Clementina's chance with Captain Standish.' ' Indeed, Mrs. Dulcimer, Tina never had any chance Avith Captain Standish. He is not a marry ing man. I have heard him say as much.'

A storm, more or less, in Vanessa's opinion made no difference. Captain Standish rode the black to hounds, and pronounced him perfect.

While Bella had been indulging in archery, dinner giving, riding, and other expensive amusements, her husband's old friend and servant, Samuel Chum ney, had returned from his fortnight's holiday, and had taken his place among those insignificant and un valued guests whom the mistress of the Park regarded rather as lookers on, or as a kind of human furniture, than as actual participators in her gaieties and pleasures. On her Thursday afternoons Mrs. Piper tolerated Chumney, as a necessary evil. His old-fashioned shirt-collars Avere ridiculous, but harmless. He was quiet, and was therefore much less vulgar than the prosperous Porkman or the mUlionaire Timperley.

Mr. Chumney looked on at Bella's career, and had his own opinion about her, and said nothing. Miss Coyle said a great deal to him, and he let her talk, but he never committed himself by any more direct expression of opinion than was to be gleaned from a grave nod, or a significant shake of the head. This dumb show of his, and the general reticence of his manners, possessed a wonderful fascination for Miss Coyle. She opened her mind to him freely, and felt herseU in the presence of supreme worldly wisdom. 'If poor Mr. Piper were only like you, that fooUsh young woman would not venture upon such conduct,' said Miss Coyle, whereupon Mr. Chumney lifted his dark eyebrows, and thrust his fingers into his waistcoat pockets, and breathed a gentle sigh. ' Spending all her mornings riding about with that Captain Standish, a man of notoriously dissipated character,' said Miss Coyle, who knew as much about"], [267, "OPENING HIS EYES. 259 the captain as she did about the inhabitants of the moon. ' Ha ! ' groaned Mr. Chumney, as if in assent to a general proposition which he could not confute. ' And making a bosom friend of that flashy Miss Porkman, while she neglects her own sisters.

'How it is that Mr. Piper doesn't see what is going on under his very nose is more than I can imagine.' 'Piper is a man in a thousand, madam,' said Mr. Chumney. ' But so foolishly confiding. Ah, Mr. Chumney, it is trying to see the present state of things, after having had the privilege of knowing the first Mrs. Piper.' ' True,' sighed Chumney. ' How different her habits were ! She was a woman of real piety, equaUy anxious about this world and the next.' ' She never could keep her cook,' said Chumney,"], [268, "260 AN OPEN VERDICT. doubtfully. ' I have seen worse cooking at Piper's table than ever I saw in my own humble lodging.' 'Poor Mrs. Piper was not fortunate with her servants,' assented Miss Coyle, ' but then she was such a good manager. No waste or riot in her time. Hoav self-denying she was ! To my own knoAvledge she rarely discarded a sUk gown tUl it had been turned twice.' Miss Coyle knew very little and talked a great deal. Mr. Chumney knew a great deal and held his peace, waiting, with masterly patience, until the time should come for him to speak. For the last three months he had taken upon himself the office of a private inquirer, without fee or reward. He had made it his business to find out all that was to be known about Captain Standish. He had gone into all manner of company in order to make these discoveries, but his informants had been chiefly of the back-stairs \u2014 grooms, valets, tailors, boot makers, horse dealers, people of aU grades, who had been honoured with the captain's custom or patronage. The result of his inquiries showed that Captain"], [269, "OPENING HIS EYES. 261 Standish was an unscrupulous, unprincipled man \u2014 a man who paid his way, simply because he had plenty of money whereAvith to gratify his desires, but who did not shrink from a dishonourable act, or hesitate at a baseness, where dishonourable, or base, dealing could further his aims. He had contrived in a brief career to do as much mischief as would have earned for a young nobleman a handsome reputation, in the days when men wore powder and patches, and consi dered iniquity a distinction. Another man in Samuel Chumney's position might have made an immediate use of his knowledge, and let his friend know the kind of person he had admitted to his house ; but Mr. Chumney preferred to wait for some crushing proof of the captain's unworthiness, and he was not disinclined to let BeUa proceed far enough in her folly to disenchant her husband. ' It will give Piper the whip-hand over her for the rest of his days,' he thought, ' if he finds her out in a compromising flirtation with this fellow Standish.' This was the condition of affairs up to the evening before the foxhunt, when Mr. Chuniney,"], [270, "262 AN OPEN VERDICT. through one of his horsey informants, became ac quainted with the history of Captain Standish's purchase of the black called Erebus. This piece of information he considered it his duty to impart to Mr. Piper, without loss of time, so he walked over to Little Yafford next morning for that purpose. It was the last day of October, and a lovely morn ing. The wind was in the south, a wind so balmy and gentle, that it only caressed the red and golden foliage, and hardly scattered the leaves. Here and there a withered leaf dropped lazily down from the dark brown branches, wet and shining with autumnal dew. The grass beside the road glistened in the morning light. A veU of vapour shrouded the hills, and gave a look of mystery to the distant land scape. Now and then a gleam of sunshine pierced the mist, brightening and warming all things, and then aU was gray again. ' A fine morning for the hounds,' said a passing rustic by way of salutation, but Samuel Chumney responded only with a sulky nod. He did not care for the hounds. He looked upon aU field sports as Avaste and foolishness, and considered it man's proper"], [271, "OPENING HIS EYES. 263 avocation all over the Avorld to sit upon a high stool in a counting-house and add up columns of figures. He felt a half-scornful tolerance for soldiers and sailors, as needed to protect commerce, and defend the rights of the men who sat in counting-houses. But for all other grades of humanity he had only contempt. Even for Mr. Chumney's long legs it Avas a two hours' walk from the town to the village, so, al though he had started directly after his breakfast, it was nearly eleven o'clock when he arrived at the Park. Mr. Piper Avas walking up and doAvn the laAvn in front of his draAving-room windoAvs, smoking his morning cigar. ' Holloa, Chum,' he exclaimed, ' what wind blows you this way? Come over to have a look at the farm, have you? The pigs are doing beautifully. I feel pretty sure of a prize for some of 'em. It's as much as they can do to stand already. Take any thing after your walk ? No ? Well, I know what a sober old file you are. Come round and have a look at the pigs.' Mr. Piper put his arm through Chumney's, and"], [272, "264 AN OPEN VERDICT. led him towards the farm, which was shut off from the park and gardens by shrubberies and a fir plan tation. ' Hang your pigs ! ' cried Chumney. ' To my eye a prize pig is the most hideous object in creation. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ought to interfere. They're doAvn upon a coster monger for over-driving his donkey, but they don't say7 a word against a nobleman for making an animal's existence a slow martyrdom, by gorging it with oil-cake untU its legs refuse to carry the weight of its overfed carcass.' Mr. Piper, elated with the anticipation of a prize at the Christmas Cattle Show, was in no humour to give ear to the voice of humanity on the lips of his old cashier. ' Come and have a look at the pigs, Chum, and don't you take to preaching sermons in your old age. It ain't oU-cake either, old boy. It's milk and meal, and the pork will eat as tender as a chicken and as mellow as a William pear. Do you suppose the animals are unhappy ? Not a bit of it.

And as to their not being able to stand, why, I've seen Porkman and Timperley many a time after dinner when they've not been able to stand, and they were as happy as lords.' They had arrived at the pigsties by this time, and Mr. Chumney was regaled with the sight of various mountains of pinky flesh, out of whose tremulous bulk issued smothered gruntings as a sole indication of life. Here and there something like an ear was to be seen pendent from a hillock of bristly pinkness, but Mr. Chumney looked in vain for an eye. The organs of sight had disappeared under pendulous ridges of fat. 'You may call that an improving exhibition,' pro tested Chumney. ' I don't. And now if you will withdraw your mind from your pigs for five or ten minutes, I've got something serious to say to you.' ' Serious ?' exclaimed Mr. Piper. ' Another failure in the wool trade, I suppose. Well, thank goodness, they can't touch me. My money is safe.' 'I'm not going to talk about your money. Where's Mrs. Piper ?

They had turned out of the farmyard iuto the plantation, a pleasant place for a morning walk and a friendly chat. The ground was carpeted with fir needles, and Mr. Piper had trodden for himseff a narrow track under the trees, while he smoked his after-breakfast cigar. ' Now, old Chum,' he said. ' Nobody can over hear us here. Say your say. It's something about yourself, I suppose ? ' ' No, it isn't. It's something about you.

' Don't be a fool ! ' cried Mr. Piper, angrily. ' Do you suppose I don't know how to take care of my wife ? She likes to have Standish here, because he's the fashion, and everybody runs after him. I like her to have him here for the same reason. The Porkmans and the Timperleys would give their eyes to be as intimate with Captain Standish as we are ; but they haven't the knack of making their houses pleasant to a man of his stamp. BeUa has. She's spent my money pretty fast, but I don't begrudge it to her, for she's given me a position in society that I never had in Moggie's time, and I'm not too proud to own it.

It was intertwined Avith his faith in himself, and that was invincible. ' I couldn't be jealous tf I tried,' he said. ' My self-respect wouldn't allow me.' ' I don't want you to be jealous, but I want you to respect yourself,' answered Chumney. ' I might have spoken sooner, perhaps, but I waited till I had good grounds for speaking. First and foremost, I've found out all about Captain Standish. He's a bad lot.' ' He's received everywhere in the highest society.' ' There are a good many bad lots going about in high society, Avithout any brand upon 'em either. He's not a man I'd receive in my house, if I had a house.' ' But you haven't, you see,' said Piper, testily. ' That makes all the difference. Perhaps if you had a big house like this, and wanted to fill it with pleasant people, you'd lower your standard of morality a bit.

You have boasted of getting Erebus for a hundred pounds, and have been laughed at by men who know all about the horse. I had heard some queer things said, but I only learned the real state of the case last night.' ' I don't believe it,' exclaimed Piper. ' Why should Captain Standish spend his money on a horse for my wife?' 'I don't know why, but I know he has done it,' returned Chumney. ' Read that ! ' He handed Mr. Piper a cutting from Bell's Life.

A SHORT RECKONING. When Chumney was gone Ebenezer Piper Avalked up and down the narroAv track in the pine plan tation, ruminating upon what he had been told. Why should any man, hoAvever princely in his ideas, make a gift of two hundred and thirty guineas to another man's Avife ? Such a thing could hardly happen, Avithout implying evil design in the giver. BeUa might be innocent, but this man was guUty. This gift of the horse Avas one act of many, all tending toAvards a viUanous con clusion. And then there came back upon Mr. Piper's mind the whole history of his wife's acquaintance with Captain Standish \u2014 how this man, whose reputation had been made by an insolent exclu siveness, had been, from his introduction at the Park, a constant visitor. Mr. Piper had been flat-"], [283, "275 A SHORT RECKONING. tered by this distinction, and had ascribed Captain Standish's preference to an Epicurean appreciation of his fine house, and an intellectual pleasure in his conversation. Now, all at once, he saw the past in a neAV light, and knew that he had been blind, and deaf, and foolish. Bella's pretty face had been the attrac tion ; Bella's Avinning manners had been the lure. 'If I thought that she had encouraged him, knowing his drift, if I kneAV that she had been false to me by so much as one erring thought, I would have done Avith her at once and for ever. She owes me too much. No, it is impossible. It isn't in human nature to be so base. And that pretty little smiling face of hers \u2014 no, that could not lie.' This AA*as how he argued with himself. Yet there was no assurance in his mind. His self respect was strong stiU, his belief in his own claims and merits still unshaken ; but there had appeared to him a vision of a phenomenal false hood, a preternatural iniquity in woman. 'If he spent his money for that horse, and she"], [284, "276 AN OPEN VERDICT. accepted the gift knoAvingly, it AA7as not his first gift,' he said to himself. 'There have been letters passing between them, perhaps. I'll search her room, and if I find one shred of evidence against her she shall stand condemned. I'll have no half measures. Either she's my true and honest Avife, or she's \u2014 something that shaU have no shelter under my roof. She must be all or nothing to me,' He went back to the house. ' Has your missus come back ?

Mr. Piper passed the open doorAvay of the dining-room, through Avhich he could see the table laid for the mid-day meal, with that modern elegance and gloAv of colour which Bella had substituted for the commonplace arrange ments that had obtained before her time.

Mr. Piper, standing at gaze and breathing his hardest, in the centre of this crowded toy-shop room, looked A'ery like the traditional buU in the china-shop, and an infuriated bull to boot. He had come there Avith a purpose, but for the moment he paused irresolute. He felt ashamed of himself for doubting his wife ever so little. The sight ot this room reassured him. ' Didn't I give her every one of these things ? ' he said to himself. ' Hoav can she help being fond of me ? ' And then, just at that moment, his eye lighted upon something which he had not given her. A Parian statuette, on a black marble base, Danneker's famous Ariadne. 'No, I didn't give her that,' he said, 'and it wasn't among her wedding presents. That's some thing from him! The table was covered Avith books. He took"], [286, "278 AN OPEN A'ERDICT. up one in cream-coloured calf, gilt edged, tooled, an exquisite specimen of Riviere's binding \u2014 Alfred de Musset's poems.

In front of the AvindoAv there stood an old Dutch escritoire, inlaid with many-coloured woods, a thing of numerous draAvers and recesses, and quaint hiding-places, in which to keep secret store of money or documents. It might have been the joy of some Dutch housewife in days gone by, or the private treasury of some rich burgher, in the fat and fertile Low Countries, where life slides gently by in an unostentatious prosperity,"], [287, "279 A SHORT RECKONING. Mr. Piper had seen his Avife write her letters at this desk. The lid Avas closely shut, locked. This exasperated him, though it was hardly a circum stance to be Avondered at that a lady should lock her desk. In Mr. Piper's present temper it seemed an evidence of guUt. He tried to wrench open the lid by means of its delicate brass handles, and failing in this, he took out a strong knife which he used for lopping an occasional Avithered branch in his park or gardens, and prised the lock. Within all things Avere neatly arranged. Packets of dainty note-paper and envelopes, gold and ivory penholders, mother-o'-pearl blotting-book, pigeon-holes filled with letters. Mr. Piper emptied the pigeon-holes, and ran his eye rapidly over their contents. The letters were all undeniably feminine. No, there was nothing here from Captain Standish. But then these old cabinets generally contain hidden receptacles for guilty secrets, sly nests, in which to hatch state, or domestic, treason. Mr. Piper seized the sandahvood beading that framed the pigeon-holes, Avith both his hands, and"], [288, "280 AN OPEN VERDICT. drew them out bodily, in one piece, like a drawer. Behind them appeared a row of neat little recesses, each with its inlaid door. 'This is where she would keep anything she wanted to hide,' thought Mr. Piper. He was not mistaken. In one of the recesses he found some money lying loose. A bank note and half a dozen sovereigns. In another there Avas a morocco jewel-case, containing an opal cross set with diamonds, a trinket Avhich Mr. Piper had never seen till that moment. A third recess was crammed with letters, this time unmistakably masculine. BeUa's husband sat doAvn before the desk, and read these letters one by one, carefully. His com mercial instincts came to his aid and kept him wondrously cool. He arranged the letters according to their dates, and after reading one, folded and endorsed it neatly before he laid it aside, as if it had been a business document.

Then they grew stiU warmer \u2014 the old, old story, abuse of the stern laws that set up the accident of Avedlock as a barrier against the divinity of passion. There was a great deal Mr. Piper could not understand, but the gist of all was very clear to him. He saw that to the bottom of her heart his wife had been false, and that if she had hesitated on the brink of criminal treason, it was because she loved Little Yafford Park and the weafth that went along with it, not because she had one spark of gratitude or affection for him, Ebenezer Piper. There was no limit to her treachery. The hus band saw himself ridiculed, travestied \u2014 in the lover's letters.

Mr. Piper made the letters up into a couple of neat bundles, and put them in his pocket. There Avas a letter for every day in the Aveek. Captain Standish's idleness had run into letter-Avriting. Then, pale to the lips, but cold and firm, Mr. Piper replaced the pigeon-holes, shut the escritoire, and Avent doAvnstairs to see if his Avife had yet come home. ' Home,' he repeated. ' No, she shall never call my house by that name again.' And then he remembered his first wife, with her humble dog-like fidelity, her narroAv spirit, troubled about many things, but ahvays true to him, reverencing him as the king of men, the epitome of Avisdom.

His mind was so full of these that the fact of his AA'ife's prolonged absence troubled him not at all. It did not even strike him as strange that she should be so long away. That other AA-onder, the strangeness of her treachery, the wonder that any woman could so deceive, absorbed every thought. He sat before the fire, meditating this great iniquity, and Avith only a dreamy sense that the day had been long, and that evening was drawing in. So be sat, tUl he Avas startled by the sound of wheels upon the gravel drive. He went to the door and looked out through the glass panel.

Bella was lying with her face turned aAvay from the light, her lovely auburn hair rippling over the pillows \u2014 that hair whose luxuriance had been one of her charms. One little haud lay inert upon the satin coverlet. How pretty she was ! The sense of"], [299, "291 LET SILENCE BE ABOUT HER NAME. her beauty struck her husband with actual pain. So lovely, so innocent-looking, and so false ! ' If she had lived I would have never seen her face again,' he thought, ' but now it doesn't matter.' He sat down in the arm-chair by her bed, and waited for her to speak. For himself there was nothing that he could say to her. There was an aching pity for her untimely fate in his heart, co existent with his burning indignation at her treachery. The fact that she Avas speedUy to die might touch him Avith compassion, but it could not lessen the baseness of her ingratitude or make her falsehood pardonable.

' That Avould be a natural desire,' said Cyril. ' I cannot conceive that there can be much diffi culty in finding her,' continued the Vicar. ' A young woman of landed estate cannot hide herself under a bushel. She has a banker to whom she must apply when she wants funds for her travelling expenses. He must know something of her whereabouts.' ' Where does she bank ? ' asked CyrU. 'At Hodge and Turner's, at Great Yafford, the Couuty Bank.'

Cyril walked to Great Yafford that afternoon, saw the bank manager, and ascertained from him that Miss Harefield had written to the bank, from Paris, for six hundred pounds in circular notes, almost immediately after she left Little Yafford. She had drawn nothing since that time. The cir cular notes had been obtained by Messrs. Hodge and Turner, through their London agents, from the Temple Bar branch of the Union Bank. ' The circular notes Avould go back to the bank that issued them, would they not ? ' asked Cyril. ' Naturally, but there is no rule as to the time of their return. The local banker who cashed a note might hold it over untU he had other bUls to transmit. A considerable time might elapse before the notes got back to the bank that issued them.' ' I shall go to the Union and try to find out when and where the notes were cashed. Miss Harefield has been away more than six months. Some of the notes, at least, must have come back to the bank.

The letter was Avritten, and Cyril started by the midday train for London.

Five notes had been cashed in Florence during the months of May and June. A note had been cashed at Brest in August, one at Rennes in the same month, two at St. Malo in September. There was nothing later than this. The notes bore the address as well as the signature of the writer. On those last notes cashed at St. Malo the address was, Hotel Chateaubriand, St. Servans. It was the beginning of November. CyrU was in a position to trace Miss Harefield's movements up to the 29th of September. She might have remained even longer at St. Malo. It Avas clearly there that he must go."], [322, "314 AN OPEN VERDICT. HappUy for his impatience, Avhich was extreme, the St. Malo boat saUed that night from Southampton. Within tAventy-four hours after he left the Union Bank, Cyril was in the broad windy street of St. Servans. The proprietress of the hotel perfectly remem bered Miss Harefield. They had many English visitors, but this lady was so distinguished. She was at once so amiable and so dignified. She and her companion had always dined in their own salon. They had never appeared at the table d'hote. They had engaged a carriage for their express use, and had driven about to all the interesting places in the neighbourhood. The landlady was obligingly com municative, but when she was asked where Miss Harefield went upon leaving St. Servans, her infor mation came to a stop. There was the visitors' book, in which Miss Harefield and Madame Leonard had written their names, but beyond their names nothing. ' But these ladies must surely have given instruc tions for their letters being sent after them,' said CyrU."], [323, "'BUT PROVE ME WHAT I WOULD NOT DO.' 315 'But no, Monsieur. They received no letters while they were here ; they appeared to expect none.' 'Did you never hear them talk of where they meant to go ?

He seemed no nearer Beatrix now, at St. Malo, than he had been at Little Yafford. Six weeks ago she had been an inmate of this hotel, but in six weeks she might have travelled to the other end of Europe. She, who was as free as the wind, would hardly care to dawdle about the quiet old towns of Brittany. ' Was Miss Harefield well \u2014 did she seem in good spirits ? ' he asked the landlady. ' Alas, no ! she had been suffering. She came to St. Servans for the sea baths. She needed strength. She had the air of one who had suffered much grief. Madame Leonard was always bright and cheerful, and devoted to the young lady ; but the English miss was not happy. That shoAved itself to the eye.'"], [324, "316 AN OPEN VERDICT. ' Had she .any medical attendant Avhile she was Avith you ? ' ' No. She mocked herself of doctors.' Cyril thanked the kindly proprietress, and strolled idly aAvay from the hotel. He knew not which direc tion to take. The prospect was discouraging. Per haps, after all, he would be compelled to put an advertisement in the Times, informing Beatrix, in veUed words, that a letter of her father's awaited her at a certain address. But even if he did this, Iioav could he be sure she would see the paper? He knew of old how difficult it is to find an English newspaper in a French provincial town. No, he must find her himself; but to his impatience the thing seemed hopeless at the outset. He walked through the well-remembered streets, by the ever improving fortifications, white stone walls looking out upon a bright blue sea. The yeUow sands by the Grand Be* were deserted by their holiday crowd. The cold autumn winds swept over the long low shores. Everything had a desolate look. CyrU went into St. Malo to see the churches, Avhich he remembered years ago. He spent a couple"], [325, "'BUT PROVE ME WHAT I WOULD NOT DO.' 317 of hours looking at painted windows and sculptured tombs. And then he wasted another hour stroUing about the streets and the quay, watching the boat being loaded, and wondering what he should do next. And then he went to the railway station to find out aU about the trains, with a vague hope that some idea might suggest itseif as to Beatrix's journey when she left St. Malo. He was on his way to the station when a face flashed upon him in one of the narrow streets, and passed him by before he had time to remember Avhere he had seen it. Whose face could it be, and why was it so familiar ? He stopped to consider, and looked back to see if the owner of the face was still in sight. Yes, there she was, walking briskly along the narrow pave ment, threading her way dexterously through the crowd, a Uttle woman, neatly dressed in a black silk gown and a gray mantle. Dimly, as in a dream, did he remember that face. It must have been a memory of long ago, he thought.

It was strange to see her in a dress so dif ferent from her nun-like habit, but then she bad told him that she belonged to no conventual order. Once having given her the start, it was not easy to gain upon her, she tripped along so briskly, and the street here close to the market was crowded. Cyril was almost breathless when he caught her .

He could not say how long she had lived there, as he had been only driving the dUigence for a month. They drove through lanes and past fields and orchards which were entirely DeA7onian in their aspect, halted at a village which was quainter and more picturesque, and, sooth to say, a little dirtier than a Devonshire viUage, and finally arrived, as the shades of evening were faUing, at Dol, which impressed CyrU at first sight as the dullest town he had ever beheld.

There was one rather pretty-looking house, in a small walled garden, and before the door of this garden the diligence stopped, and the lady in the gray mantle alighted. A French maid-servant opened the gate and ran out to take the traveller's parcels, and then mistress and maid went in at the door, and the walled garden swallowed them up. The diligence deposited Cyril at an old inn in a small square not far from the cathedral, a good old house enough, where all things were cleanly and comfortable, and where he found a good-natured landlady, who was quite ready to answer bis ques tions AvhUe he waited for the table d'hote dinner. He described the Avhite house in the walled garden just outside the town, and asked if she could tell him anything about its inmates. It was a house which let itself garnished, she told him, the owner being a merchant at Rennes, who only came to Dol occasionally, because it was his birthplace. Of its present inmates Madame"], [333, "FAIR STILL, BUT FAIR FOR NO ONE SAVING ME. 325 knew nothing. She did not even knoAV that it was let. It had been long unoccupied. She excused herself for this ignorance on the ground that she went out so seldom. The house, and then the kitchen occupied all her time, not to speak of her two little angels, avIio were exacting, hke all chUdren. Of the two little angels, one was then squalling lustUy in the adjoining kitchen, while the other hung to its mother's gown and scowled at the stranger. 'Have you had many EngUsh visitors this season ? ' CyrU inquired. ' Oh yes, Monsieur, a crowd. The English love so much our Brittany \u2014 and Dol is the first town in Brittany. It is interesting to the traveUer were it only for that reason.' 'Naturally. Since September now \u2014 the end of September \u2014 can you recall any English visitors, ladies, who have been with you ? ' ' But no, Monsieur. After September our season is over^ It is late. We have had no English ladies since then.'"], [334, "326 AN OPEN VERDICT. ' There are other hotels at Dol, I suppose ? ' ' Yes, Monsieur, but this is the first.' Cyril dined with a few sleepy-looking inhabit ants, and a couple of sub-lieutenants from the neighbouring barracks, and after his dinner went to look at the cathedral, AA'hich had a shadowy grandeur by the light of a few solitary lamps burning here and there before a shrine. After this he was glad to go to bed, having slept very little on board the St. Malo steamer. He put Christian Harefield's letter under his pilloAv.

Neighbours there were none. So he left the spot no wiser than Avhen he had approached it. The morning was lovely, the air balmy, despite the lateness- of the season. It was just that calm, delightful hour when earth seems as fresh as if the Creator's work were but newly finished. Cyril set out on a perambulation of the neighbourhood of Dol. His hostess had talked to him last night of a certain Mont Dol, as a thing to be seen, so he went to see what this Mont Dol was like. He walked for about a couple of miles through a level country, somewhat Flemish in its character, a country that had only the charm of rusticity to recommend it. Then he came aU at once upon a raAv-looking church, of a commonplace order, a few straggling cottages, and a steep rugged-looking hUl, which rose out of the level plain with an ex traordinary suddenness. He climbed this hill by a rough road, which dwindled by and by into a narrow Avinding track, and mounted in the early sunUght to an undulating heathy hill-top looking Avide over the blue Avaters of the Channel. On"], [336, "328 AN OPEN A'ERDICT. this hill-top there was no human habitation, only a votive chapel and the Avhite statue of a saint, looking down upon the quiet hillocks and holloAvs, the clumps of furze, and tranquU sheep cropping the deAA7y grass in the SAveet morning air. He had never looked on a move pleasant scene. The world, life, and all its cares lay far below him \u2014 the blue Avood smoke was curling up from the chimneys of many-gabled Dol, the church tower and its stunted tAvin brother, the tower that had never been finished, rose darkly above all meaner things on the level plain, white sails of passing vessels were shining yonder against the blue horizon. He felt himself alone upon this lonely hiU, in a serener atmosphere than the air of every-day life. A saintly hermit of old time might have passed his contem plative days pleasantly enough in a cell adjoining the chapel yonder. He rambled round the hill-top, lingering every now and then to look landward or seaAvard, for on either side the prospect was full of beauty. It was a spot where any man, with a genuine love of nature, might feel that he could spend"], [337, "FAIR STILL, BUT FAIR FOR NO ONE SAVING ME. 329 hours and days of life, alone with his own thoughts and the peaceful beauty round him. The big bell of Dol chimed nine, the bright autumn sun climbed higher in the blue clear sky, a sheep-bell tinkled, an elderly lamb bleated, a little shepherd boy sang his little nasal song, a late bumble-bee buzzed among late furze bloom. There were no other sounds. Cyril made the circuit of the chapel, which was closely locked against intrusion. He looked at the statue, and turned his face idly seaward for the twentieth time, thinking within himself hoAv foolishly he was wasting his day, and how little this perambulation of the Mont Dol would help him towards the accomplishment of his mis sion ; and as he was thinking thus, and as he turned from the statue to the sea, he found him self face to face with something sweeter than the glad blue sea, dearer than all the wide bright earth, the face of the woman he loved. She was standing before him, looking at him with a grave sad smile, dressed in black, and thin and careAvorn, beautiful only for eyes that lcved"], [338, "330 AN OPEN A'ERDICT. her, since she had Avasted the freshness of her youth and beauty in tears and sleepless nights, and untimely cares.

'Why should you want to find me ? ' she asked. ' I thought there were no two persons on this earth with less reason to wish to meet than you and I.' ' I should not have presumed to folloAv you if I had not a motive strong enough to excuse my audacity. I have brought you this.' He took Christian Harefield's last letter from his pocket, and gave it her without a word of explanation ' From my father ! ' she cried, looking at the address, and then tearing open the envelope with trembling hands. ' In heaven's name how did you come by this letter \u2014 from my dead father?
