The information I received from him, indeed, related more immediately to another object than the one before us ; but as a future opportunity may not offer, I seize the present with avidity to own my obli gations. By Mr. Bryant I was favoured with a map which I could not otherwise have procured ; and to Mr. Marsden, the historian of Sumatra, I am indebted for an introduction to Mr. Dalrymple. Such are the favours I have received from literary friends, but to the Gentlemen in the service of the East India Company I have obligations of a different kind.

From Mr. Jones, Resident for the Company at Busheer and Basra, I obtained much information in the space oi a short interview ; but he left London before I could prosecute my inquiries, and much to my regret ; as I had promised myself great advantage from his inti mate knowledge of the country and the language, and his intercourse with the people in power ; circumstances which qualify him to give a better account of the present state of Persia than almost any other visitor of the East. But Mr. Dalrymple demands the utmost tribute of my o-ratitude. I have had access to his whole collection o published and unpublished, and his advice upon every question of doubt or difficulty. Two charts, composed under his direction, accompany the Voyage of Nearchus ; and as one of them comprehends a part of the coast which, without his assistance, was inexplicable, a short account of the survey on which it is founded cannot be unacceptable. In the year 1774, a little squadron was equipped at Bombay for the purpose of exploring the coast between the Indus and the Gulph of Persia.

Captain Blair has in some measure assisted me in tracing the whole coast of Mekran which I describe, and, with a liberality congenial to his profession, has favoured me with a sketch, of the coast at Cape Jask, which solves a geographical question left in obscurity by the ancient writers ; and, previously to this attempt, undecided by the moderns*. The second chart, containing the Gulph of Persia, was of less difficult construction, from the ample supply of modern information in the possession of Mr. Dal rymple ; but his chief reliance is fixed upon Lieutenant M'Cluer 3, another officer in the service of the East India Company, and whom he regards as a navigator of ex traordinary merit and abilities.

At the head of the gulph, and in the. disposition of the channels of the Euphrates, Tigris, and Euleus, Mr. d'Anville has been misled, from want of materials which have since been supplied by the pub lications cf Niebuhr, and the investigation of our English navigators.

The Por tuguese had a settlement at Guadel, and one or two others on the coast. Some of their accounts in Latin I have searched in vain ; and Osorius, whom Dr. Robert son quotes with respect, I examined, but found his period was too early to avail me. Some apology is requisite for the other Maps I have introduced. They are compiled from d'Anville, Rennell, and Dalrymple ; but they are the effort of one who never composed a Map before. The use of them is to connect the motions of the army with those of the fleet, and to explain the geography of Arrian ; but the 4 A few names occur in de Barros.Ra musio's Collection, torn. i. p. 388; and I* have likewise examined the English trans lations of Manuel deFaria y Sousa (1605), and of Heman Lopes de Castaneda (1582), with little success.

In modern names also I write Phoregh, and not Fohregh ; because the Ph preserves the relation of Phooreh with Poora, which Arrian makes the capital of Gadrosia. In comparing Oriental names with European orthography, I wish every inquirer to notice, that B. G. D. K. P. T6. have the aspirate added to them by a point as n. B. 2 BH. and the same distinction is made by a diacritical point in many Eastern languages, as well as in the Hebrew.' A minute attention to this has led me to more discoveries than one. In writing names familiar in our English charts, I pre fer the most popular, but generally notice the variation either on the first mention of it, or occasionally as the usage of it occurs. Thus I adopt Busheer and Bomba reek, as known to every English navigator, rather than Abusch\u00e6hr and Cohum-barick \\ which Niebuhr pro nounces to be the Oriental orthography.

The diffi- culty of ascertaining the resemblance of Alexander arises from two different causes : the firbt is, that the gold coins of this monarch bear the head of Minerva, and his silver coins the head of Hercules ; the second is, that Lysippus only was allowed to exe- cute his statue in brass, and Apelles only to delineate him with the pencil. Pictures perish by the course of time ; brass statues are destroyed by the founder; and if any representation of him was executed in marble, we have no account either of the work or the artist ; the consequence is, that we have little certainty in regard to his por- trait, from any model now in existence. We know indeed from history, that- the features of his face were peculiarly beautiful ; and we learn from a Greek Inscrip- tion, that Lysippus formed him with an elate countenance, and a look aspiring up to heaven. Both these circumstances concur in the coin here engraved, and in a small brass coin given by M. Chaussard, N\u00b0 5. It is possible that a statue by Ly- sippus might still exist in the age of Severus or Caracalla; and the enthusiasm of those sovereigns, or the reverence which the Macedonians bore to the name of Alexander, might be a sufficient cause for preserving this resemblance on their coins. Just so far the coin now engraved has the chance of being a genuine resemblance, as justly as any other.

Historical facts demand our attention in proportion to % the interest we feel, or the consequences we derive from them ; and the consequences of this voyage were such, that as, in the first instance, it opened a communication between Europe and n"], [50, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 2 the most distant countries of Asia, so, at a later period, was ifc the source and origin of the Portuguese discoveries, the founda tion ofthe greatest commercial system, ever introduced into the world ; and consequently the primary cause, however remote, of the British establishments in India. The narrative of this voyage has been preserved to us by Arrian, who professes to give an extract from the journal of Nearchus ; and notwithstanding its authenticity has been dis puted (which is a question that will be fully discussed here after), Ave may venture to assert, that it presents to an unpre judiced mind every internal evidence of fidelity and truth. It has been the peculiar felicity of Arrian to rise in estimation, in proportion to the degree of attention paid to the transactions he records. As our knowledge of India has increased, the ac curacy of his historical researches has been established ; and as the limits of geography have been extended, the exactness of his information has become daily more conspicuous, and the purity of the sources from whence he drew, more fully acknow ledged. In regard to the voyage of Nearchus, a mere translation of the work of Arrian would have given but a barren detail' of names, with little satisfaction to the curious spirit of modern investigation, and would in fact have been superfluous : for translations ' of this narrative are to be found in Ramusio Purchas, Ablancourt, Rook, and Harris *.

So far as concerns the passage down the Indus, and the navi gation of the Gulph of Persia, this has been already performed by Major Rennell and Mr. d'Anville ; but Major Rennell 3 leaves Nearchus at the mouth of the Indus, and Mr. d'Anville * takes him up at the entrance of the Persian Gulph ; the intermediate space they have both abandoned, as too obscure, or too unin teresting for investigation, though the merit of the commander depends upon the difficulties he surmounted in this part of his voyage more especially ; and the clearing up of the geographical obscurity was an object worthy of the talents of two such masters in the science.

II. ALEXANDER. The researches of modern historians and geographers have taught us to consider Alexander neither as an hero of chivalry on the one hand, nor as a destroying ravager on the other. We are no longer misled by the invectives of Seneca, or dazzled with the inflated declamation of Q. Curtius. As the writings of Arrian have become better known, the just standard of this illustrious character has been fixed : the rapidity of his success has appeared the result of prudence 5 as well as valour, while his system of government and plans of empire have been found con sistent with the soundest policy. Previous to the expedition of the Macedonians, the empire of Persia had been invaded by Cimon the Athenian, and in a 5 *Oi ys\u00bb _t u\\\\o. ir__.Tt. dvrov Itnjvx^i tikss, ni.. de Scipione, lib. x. c. 2.

The utmost extent of these several invasions was to Avaste the provinces, to support a Grecian army with the spoils of Asia, and to insult the great King in return for the calamities brought upon Greece by the expeditions of his predecessors. But Alexander, from the moment he crossed the Hellespont, considered every country he subdued as a portion of his future empire. He never plundered a single province that submitted, he raised no contributions by extortion. From the battle ofthe Gramcus, to the final defeat of Darius at Arbela, although he had overrun Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt, the richest coun tries of the empire, his conquests were attended with no op pression of the people, no violation of the temples, no insult to religion. Order and regulation engaged his attention equally with the conduct of the war; his measures were taken with such prudence, that during eight years absence at the extremity of the East, no revolt of consequence occurred, and his settle ment of Egypt was so judicious as to serve for a model to the Romans in their administration of that province, when it became subject to their dominion. After the defeat of Darius at Arbela, the flight of that unfortunate monarch, and the pursuit of the usurper Bessus, led Alexander to Sogdiana, Bactria, and the northern provinces of the empire. The consequence naturally was, that when he determined to enter India, he found himself at the sources of the Indus 6. * All the invasions of India are in the same reason is evident ; the Sewalick mountains are course.

Whatever vanity is attached to the foundation of cities, and hoAvever this passion might operate upon Alexander, utility was still the prevailing motive in his mind. Harris I0 has judiciously observed, that most of the cities founded by the Syrian kings existed little longer than their founders * and perhaps, if Ave except Antioch on the Orontes, and Seleucia on the Tigris, there Avas not one capable of existing : but the Paropamisan \" Alexandria \", and that on the Iaxartes \", continue to this clay cities of importance ; and the Alexandria of Egypt, after sur- viving the revolution of empires for eighteen centuries, perished at last only in consequence of a discovery Avhich changed the Avhole system of commerce throughout the Avorld.

The Mo- hammedan historians of this part of Asia are fond of carrying the origin of cities to very re- mote periods ; the general ignorance of the in- habitants, in respect to ancient history, scarcely permits them to question, much less to investi- gates any thing, however improbable, which has been brought forward by an author as an historical fact. Alexander, extraordinary as it may seem, is ranked by them amongst the prophets ; and they are fond of ascribing to him, or to Deeves (the Devil), the origin of 12 Candahar is supposed, both by d'Anville and Rennell, to be the Alexandria of Paropa- misus, and the tradition of the natives refers it to Scander.

These considerations, doubtless, determined the choice of Alexander ; for the AArhole sea-coast from Pelusium Ifl to Canopus is Ioav land, and not visible from a distance ; the navigation along this coast, or approach to it, is always hazardous ; the mouths, or Bogas *_ (as they are called), of the Nile are at some seasons dangerous, even to a proverb ; but the light-house on the Pharos, and the tAvo harbours Avithin it, obviated both these dangers ; and Alexander, Avho kneAv the difficulty of approaching Egypt either by land or sea, eagerly seized on a situation which presented him Avith a post of the highest importance in a \" See d'Anville on the Topography of Alexandria.

These Avere sufficient motives for the foundation of the city ; but as the vieAvs of the founder dilated with his better informa tion, so the testimony of Arrian assures us, that from the time he had formed his fleet on the Indus, he meditated a passage by sea from that river to the Gulph of Arabia. He completed what he had conceived in the most dangerous part, and left little more to the Ptolemies than to fill up the outline he had drawn. Had he lived one year longer, he might have seen the barrier removed Avhich obstructed the communication betAveen Europe and the eastern Avorld, and the commerce of both con tinents beginning to floAvin the channel he had opened. He might have contemplated the dawn of that splendour which Avas to rise on Alexandria, and the source of that Avealth Avhich was. to render her the first commercial city in the Avorld. The advantages derived to every country which has partici pated in the commerce of the East Indies, have been so fully displayed by Dr. Robertson, that there is no pretence for en croaching on his province ; but that Alexander kneAv the value of this commerce, foresaw the consequences of it, and gaA-e a direction to the course in which it floAved for eighteen centuries, is a glory Avhich even the more important discoveries of modern Europe cannot obliterate.

This route he extended after wards across all those streams Avhich the Akesines or Chen-ab carries into the Indus, and terminated finally at the Hy'phasis, or Biah. IV. COUNTRY AT THE SOURCES OF THE INDUS. The province Avatered by these rivers, noAv denominated the Panje-ab, or five Avaters, is esteemed one of the richest pro vinces of the Mogul empire.

In all ages, Avhenever the state of the country Avas suffi ciently peaceable to admit of commerce, there appears to have been a great intercourse by means of the Indus, descending from Multan, Attock, Cabul, and Cashmeer, to the coast of Malabar. Whether the vessels navigated on the river Avere capable of undertaking the voyage to that coast, or transferred their cargoes at Pattala into larger vessels, may be questioned ; but the communication itself is evident.

These Authors.26 assert, that Alexander subdued five thousand cities in India as large as Cos. Mention is likewise made of a thousand cities in the single province of Bactria ; and Arrian, who seems to be ahvays on his guard, informs us, that the country of. the Glaus\u00e6, or Glaucanis\u00e6, contained thirty-seven cities, the smallest of Which had five thousand, and the largest ten thousand inhabitants, and that the villages contained an 11 Pukely Ayeen Akbari, always.

All these circumstances con tribute to prove the reality of a fact highly controverted ; and even though avc were to extend the Avhole number of the fleet, comprehending tenders and boats, Avith some authors to tAv*o thousand, there is no improbability sufficient to excite astonish ment. By the same means that Alexander obtained a fleet, he acquired information in regard to the commerce of the country, and the different coasts Avith which the natives traded.

These circumstances, and the other particulars collected solely from Strabo and Arrian, are derived altogether from Macedonian information, that is, from the folloAvers of Alex ander, or the ambassadors of the Seleucid\u00e6 ; and they are so perfectly in correspondence with modern accounts, as to prove the Macedonians equally curious in their inquiries as they Avere superior in military science. The enumeration of particulars might easily h\u00a7ive been enlarged, but these are sufficient to prove that the first rational information relative to India Avas received in Europe from Alexander ; and it is to substantiate that proof that they are introduced into this Avork.

V. SURVEY O^ THE EMPIRE. The object of introducing these observations is to sheAv that the design of Alexander in planning the voyage of Nearchus Avas not merely the vanity of executing what had never yet been attempted, but that it Avas a system founded on a pre sumption of the advantages to be derived from it, a desire of knowing the coast as Avell as the interior of his empire, and a reasonable hope of uniting the whole by mutual communication and reciprocal interests. By tracing the correspondent parts of this system, Ave shall be able to evince its reality ; for though the opening of the world to the knoAvledge of mankind, as Curtius expresses it, proved in the event a concern of far greater magnitude ; the survey of the empire Avas of more immediate importance to the conqueror. The line of conquest from the Hellespont to the Indus Avas complete, but the intermediate country Avas by no means sufficiently explored. The route of the army, after the death of Darius, had been mostly 4i to the North of the Paro- pamisus, or that range of mountains, by whatsoever name distinguished, Avhich in Oriental geography separates Iran from Touran. India had been entered on its northern boundary; and when Alexander had completed his campaign at the sources of the Indus, his march and voyage doAvn the course of that river defined the eastern limit of the empire : commencing again \u2666?

To obtain the information necessary for the objects he had in view, he ordered Craterus, with the elephants and heavy bag gage, to penetrate through the centre of the empire, while he personally undertook the more arduous task of passing the deserts of Gadrosia, and providing for the preservation of the fleet. A glance over the map Avill sheAv, that the route of the army eastAvard, and the double route by Avhich it returned, in tersect the Avhole empire by three lines almost from the Tigris to the Indus. Cr&terus joined the division under Alexander in Karmania ; and Avhen Nearchus, after the completion of his voyage, came up the Pasitigris to Susa, the three routes through the different provinces, and the navigation along the coast, might be said to complete the survey of the empire. If the work of Beton and Diognetus had come doAvn to us, or had been as carefully extracted, as the voyage of Nearchus, Ave should have had better geographical data for establishing the interior divisions of the Persian empire, than any we can iioav obtain, either from the reports of travellers, or the historians of Timour and Nadir Shah. They are said to have reduced, not only the marches of the army, but the proA-inces themselves, to actual measurement ; and though the rapidity of the movements and the shortness of the time Avould not admit of an actual survey \" distances accurately set doAvn, and journals faithfully 44 Much more may be done with precision woody, or the defiles of mountains.

These officers undoubtedly attended one or other of the armies upon their- return, or they might have been allotted one to each ; in either case, the attention of Alexander is evident, for the survey itself is attested by almost every contemporary historian 4S, and was extant in the time of Strabo and Pliny. Arrian himself has given some countenance to the report concerning the motives Avhich induced Alexander to traverse the deserts of Gadrosia. He tells us, that even Nearchus imputed this attempt to vanity and the desire of imitating or surpassing Bacchus and Semiramis ; the Bacchanalian triumph of the army in its passage through Karmania, recorded by other his torians, gives some degree of authority to the testimony of Nearchus ; but Arrian, though he relates the circumstance, professes his disbelief of the fact ; and an attentive considera tion of the designs already displayed, supported by the internal evidence Avhich the journal itself will suggest, ought, in an un prejudiced mind, to exculpate Alexander from the charge of any unAvorthy motives. To perform what has never yet been performed is doubtless an object of ambition, but the utility of the performance determines the merit of the performer. That Alexander had a thirst after knowledge 4<i as Avell as con quest is a fact sufficiently established ; and the testimony of they do what no other Mohammedans of Asia do. The general, I believe I may say the uni versal, custom is to ascertain distance by a computation of the distance which a cofla or caravan travels in the space of an hour.

The map Avhich he has himself given, corrected by the journal of Mr. Forster, and explained in his Memoir, corresponds not only Avith the route of Alex ander, but Avith those of Timour s\u00b0 and Nadir Shah, with the journal of Tavernier, Goez the Jesuit, Bernier, and the Avhole history of Ferishta. Major Rennell professes to have laid doAvn the Avestern sources of the Indus and the rivers of the Panje-ab from the map of a native ; and says, that as his oavii ideas grew correct from this communication, he was consequently better enabled to folloAv the campaign of Alexander in that country, and trace his movements as they arose ; he speaks Avith confidence as to all the transac tions in the Panje-ab, and hesitates only upon some points of less importance to the westward of the Indus. But in a Avork appropriated to the military transactions of the Macedonians, in which I had once traced the route of Alexander from it's com mencement to it's termination, I had the satisfaction to find, that so In the route of Timour given by Cheref eddin, there is a regular mistake of the Ra vee (Hydraotes) for the Biah (Hy'phasis); and this mistake arises from Timour's being drawn southward to Ayjodin, near which city he crossed the Biah, where it takes the name of Dena or Donde ; but as Cheref-eddin upon Timur's return calls the Biah the river of La hore, vol. iii. p.

Tavernier, vol. ii. p. 61. mentions two routes from Candahar ; one to the North by Cabul, which he details ; the other direct by J\u00c6oultan, which he omits. The account is bar ren, and makes us doubt whether Tavernier E"], [74, "26 PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. the accuracy of his Persian information is as conspicuous to the Avestward of the Indus as to the eastAvard ; and that through the diligence of his inquiries Ave are hoav possessed of data Avhich, there is reason to believe, every future research that may be made, Avill contribute to establish. Major Rennell likeAvise in forms us, that his Persian map exhibited a series of the rivers with names correspondent to those Avhich occur in the Greek his torians ; but he has favoured us only Avith that of the Beypasha, sufficiently agreeing Avith the Hy'phasis of Arrian; this reserve*1 is the more to be regretted, as the communication Avould have contributed greatly to correct the errors and elucidate the ob scurity of his predecessors. The Antiquite Geographique de l'Inde of Mr. d'Anville is far from standing upon a level Avith the merits of his other Avorks ; and Major Rennell iZ has obsen*ed, Avith great justice, that haA*\" ing mistaken the Chelum or Hydaspes for the Indus of Alexan der, he has consequently misplaced and misnamed all the sub sequent rivers of the Panje-ab. This is far from being the only error of that able geographer ; he has confounded the rivers to the west, as Avell as those, to the east of the Indus, and by adopt. ing the Shantrou for one of the Panje-ab streams, (a name Avhich he has obtained from Bernier, and in which he does not discover that Chen-ab lies concealed,) he has confounded the Dindana, Chelum, or Hydaspes, with the Genave or Acesines, and placed Lahore on that river, Avhich, by the testimony of all the authors he usually follows (Cheref-eddin \u00bb, Tavernier, and Thevenot), is \"This was corrected in the third edition of p/21 ; and that error should have led d'An the Memoir. -ii- f\u201e - \u201e p .,, , . - . vlUe to assom<= a river for the position of La- 52 Rennell's second Memoir, p. 82. hore rather tn tV,_. .,\u201e. j _. , .

The principal source of these mis takes, whicfa Major Rennell has not sufficiently noticed, is a de termination of Mr. d'Anville's to find Aornus in Renas. Unfor tunately for his hypothesis, the Aornus of Alexander Avas to the west of the Indus, and Renas is between the Indus and the Che lum. The necessary consequence is, that d'Anville is obliged to call the Chelum, or Hydaspes, the Indus of Alexander, and af terwards to perpetuate a chain of error, the result of his original mistake. There Avould have been no difficulty to find a Petra ansAverable to Aornus in any situation to the AvestAvard of the Indus. The whole country is mountainous, and infested with mountaineer tribes of banditti, as Avas experienced by Timour and Nadir Shah, no less than by Alexander. Even an error in this respect Avould carry no consequences with it ; but the misplacing of a river vitiates the remainder of the series. This confusion is not noticed to detract from the merits of Mr. d'Anville, Avhose geo- graphical reputation stands too high to be unpaired by a failure in a single instance, but to eAdnce the danger of indulging a spi- rit of system, a system founded upon a resemblance of ancient and modern names, never exemplified more fancifully than by a supposition that Renas54 and Aornus are the same Avord, and ne ver to be admitted unless it is justified by local circumstances ra ther than similarity of sounds. Having laboured in the investigation of these points several years before the appearance of Major Rennell's Maps and Me moirs, and having no greater authority to apply to than Mr. d'Anville, I had determined to abandon the work itself, for want 54 Antiq. Geog.del'Inde, p. 17. e 2"], [76, "a8 PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. of sufficient materials to clear the difficulties which attended it : but upon the first vieAv of the last Map and Memoir, finding all the sources of Indus elucidated in the most consistent manner I resumed my labours; and if this country can noAv be detailed Avith perspicuity, let the jnerit be referred to that author from Avhom it originates. The mistakes of d'Anville prevent the application of those ma terials which modern discoveries have supplied. The errors of the ancient geographers are of less consequence, as both Pliny and Ptolemy give us generally the same series of rivers as the historians of Alexander present, and, however erroneous they may be in particulars, still preserve the general features of the whole. Pliny\" enumerates the Kophcs, the Indus, the Hy daspes, the Hyphasis, the Hesudrus, in the order they occurs and though he omits the Acesines and Hydra6tes, the picture, however incomplete, is not disfigured ; but Avhen he adds that Alexander sailed down the Indus at the rate of six hundred sta dia a-day, and yet it required more than five months to reach the mouth of the river, he is mistaken in his premises ; for it Avill be proved from Strabo and Arrian, that the passage took up nine months, and that \\rarious expeditions delayed the fleet as it arrived successively at the several tribes bordering on its banks. Perhaps Ave ought to read the passage hypothetically ; but the assertion itself is extravagant. Six hundred stadia repeated for an hundred and fifty days produce ninety thousand ; this sum, reduced by the standard of eight stadia to the Roman mile, amounts to eleven thousand two hundred and fifty miles, and it gwes no less than six thousand by the proportion of Mr. d'An- \" Lib. vi. c. 17 7"], [77, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 29 ville's stadium of fifty-one toises, Avhile the real space upon Ren nell's map occupies only eight hundred. These exaggerations 5<s doubtless originate from the authorities which Pliny folloA\\xd, and even Arrian himself is not free from charges of a similar na ture, though in a lower degree ; but if Pliny had consulted his oavii reason instead of copying his authorities with senility, he could never have assigned six thousand miles to the course of the Indus betAveen Nicea and the sea, Avhen he gives less than five\" thousand to the Avhole extent of Asia, from the Caspian defiles to the mouth of the Ganges. 5 The errors of Ptolemy58 are of another nature, consisting ge nerally in a mistaken calculation of longitudes and latitudes ; but Avhate\\*er cause Ave may have to lament his deviation in par ticulars, geography is more indebted to him for having intro duced, or at least for having established, this method of deter mining local situation, than it can ever suffer by a failure in the application of his principles. The sources from which Ptolemy dreAv, do not sufficiently appear; but as he Avas a native of Egypt, and lived at the same period with Arrian, a period in Avhich the trade between the Gulph of Arabia and India Avas in full vigour, we may imagine that he had better means of infor mation 5' at Alexandria, the centre of this commerce, than Ar- i6 Proditur Alexandrum nullo die minus (quam) stadia sexcenta navigasse in Indo, nee potuisse ante menses quinque enavigare, ad jectispaucis diebus.

This beino- the case, it is a satisfaction to find, that hoAvever misplaced the sources or the mouths of the Indus appear in the maps adapted to Ptolemy by Mercator or Gossellin, there is still* in a geographical vieA\\*, nothing in Ptolemy inconsistent Avith Arrian.

The Hydaspes, Sandabalis, Rhuadis or A*daris, Hy'pasis, and Zaradrus of Ptolemy, are the Hydaspes, Acesines, Hydraotes, Hy'phasis, and Zaranga of Arrian. The A'daris 6\u00b0 is only a vari ation in writing the H}rdra6tes of Arrian, the Hyarotis of Strabo, all derived from the Indian Ivarati6'; and the Sandabalis, if con jecture deceives me not, is merely a variation of \u25a0writing Sand-ab, for San-ab, still appearing under the form of Tchen-ab, and de pending, as I am informed, upon the enunciation of a Persian 6i letter, which fluctuates betAveen the sound of B and V; but of this I shall presently speak more at large. The mouths of the Indus are as much disordered in the maps adapted to Ptolemy as the sources ; and the origin of this disor der is the small difference of longitude which Ptolemy gives be- to Rhuadis is the Greek text in Ptolemy ; pore, Visiapoor, Vizapoor. So is this river A'daris, the Latin. written Chen-ab, Jen-ab, Gen-ave.

The difference set doAvn is only thirty minutes, and the result necessarily is, that Loni bare is advanced so much to the East as to fall into the head of the bay, and occupy the place Avhich modern geographers assign to the river Paddar. Ptolemy furnishes us Avith seven mouths, and enumerates their names ; and it is a just cause of complaint that modern geogra- phy neither supplies us Avith the means of confirming his assertion, or correcting his errors. It is probable that all great rivers which pass through level ground to the sea, as the Nile, the Danube, the Ganges, and the Indus, in process of time vary the channel of their respeetiA'-s mouths, either by inundation, obstructions, accumulation of soil, and other causes, or are diverted for the purposes of agriculture and communication. This has been so remarkably the case in regard to the Nile, that hardly any tAvo geographers, ancient or modern, correspond in their account. The mouths of the Indus labour under the same obscurity. Ma jor Rennell's second map differs essentially from his first ; three charts of Mr. Dalrymple differ from both Major Rennell's, and from each other ; and Captain Hamilton \u00b03, the only navigator I knoAV Avho went up to Tatta, has not given any account satis. factory to a geographer ; though he has preserved one circum- stance Avhich coincides Avith Ptolemy, assuring us that the natives still call the mouths of the Indus, Diyellee, or seven, though they are far more numerous. 63 Capt. Hamilton, though a very pleasant, does not appear clearly from his narrative, is not an accurate writer ; he did not go by whether he went up on the eastern or western water up to Tatta, but conducted a caravan side of the Lari-bundar river ; but this will by land from Lari-bundar to that city.

The point necessary to elucidate is the course of the two main branches, East and West, navigated by Alexan der; and to ansAver this purpose Ave might assume the Sagapa and Lonibare of Ptolemy, as the Lari-bundar and Bundar Lari of the moderns64. There is something peculiar in this modern appellation, that the same Avord reversed should be applied to the eastern and Avestern mouth of the same river; for Bundar is only a Persian term for the mouth of a river, a port, or har bour*5; and Lari, or Laheri, is common to both. Not darina*, for Avant of Oriental learning, to ascertain the antiquity of this appellation, I ought to be silent on the subject ; but I cannot 64 In a translation of the treaty between Mohammed Shah and Nadir Shah, given in Fraser, p. 226, the Mogul Emperor cedes all the country to the West of the Attock, Scind and Nala Sunkra, to the Persians, but the town of Lowry-bundar and all to the East of those streams are still to continue subject to Hindostan. Attock means the higher part of the stream; Scind and Mehran, the lower; and as Lohry or Lahri-bundar certainly means the town on the eastern branch, I conclude Nala Sunkra, the canal of Sunkra, to be the proper name for that branch; for Tatta and its dependencies are ceded to Persia, i. e. the whole Patalene. vowels vary so much, that Tchan, Tchen, Tchin, and Tchun, are equally the first sylla ble of Chin-ab. Mr. Jones adds : I confess I have always re garded the etymology of Derbend, to be a different one. I have considered it as being de rived from the Persian substantive Der, a gate ; Bund, the participle of the verb Busten, to bind ; that is to say, a place or defile so nar row as to admit of being fortified or shut up by a gate. The erection of Derbend is, amongst many other things, absurdly attributed to Is kander. Alexander. I believe the word j-\\ij Bunder to be a pro per Persian substantive, signifying a port. With much diffidence, might not the words Lari or Laheri, when added to the word Bun der, have reference to the kingdom of Lahore. The site of each almost justifies such a suppo sition. 65 Or on land, a gate or pass ; Derbend, iron-gate on the Caspian. I imagine, that in Persick it is properly Bend or Bender ; and that Bundar is a cor. ruption ; but Fraser writes Bundar. The"], [81, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 33 help expressing a conjecture that the modern Lari-bundar bears some analogy to the Lonibare * of Ptolemy. These tAvo points to the East and West, modern navigation has nearly ascertained \"7 ; and one intermediate mouth knoAvn by the name of Scindy Bar, and characterised by the Sheik's tomb, is also clearly distinguishable ; the others appear like openings that have been viewed by vessels as they passed, rather than ex amined ; and which, from the nature of the coast, probably ne ver approach near enough to determine any point Avith accu racy ; but if the tAvo extremes are sufficiently defined, we shall have data to illustrate the account of Nearchus, and resemblance enough to make Arrian and Ptolemy consistent.

As there are tAvo departures of the fleet, one from Nicea, and another from the mouth of the Indus^ it will be expedient to as certain them both ; but as the latter is most important, Ave shall commence the imrestigation by stating in the Avords of Arrian *% that the fleet took its departure from its station in the Indus on the twentieth of Boedromion, in the archonship of Cephisodorus, corresponding with the eleventh year of Alexander's reign. This precision is of consequence, because the list of archons is by no means accurate, and Avithout the addition of the year of Alexan der there would still be room for doubt. Dodwell and Usher give a triple series of archons from Diod6rus Siculus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and Arrian ; and the deduction of DodAvell does not perfectly correspond Avith Usher.

Let us therefore have recourse to the year of xllexander, Avhich, from a variety of concurrent testimonies, is easily established. According to Plutarch, Alexander Avas born 70 in the first year of the hundred and sixth Olympiad, on the sixth day of Heca tombeon, ansAvering to the Macedonian month Lous\". This date corresponds, according to DodAvell\", with the tAventy-sixth day of July, in the year three hundred and fifty-six before Christ. Concerning the actual day, Scaliger\", Petavius and DodAvell are at variance ; in regard to the year, they are all agreed ; and the additional testimony of Usher is a confirma tion. Alexander succeeded to the throne, Olympiad cxi. 1. or in the year three hundred and thirty-six before Christ ; and according to Usher on the twenty-fourth of September.

The dis cordance is reconciled by others, who suppose that the alteration in the commencement of the Attic year led Plutarch into an error.

But if he began to reign in three hundred and thirty-six M before Christ, the year three hundred and twenty-six is consequently the eleventh year of his reign. This is the date Arrian means to establish ; and whether or not he has given the right name of the archon is not very material. This discussion might have been spared if Dioddrus and Pe tavius had not stood in the Avay ; for though Elian labours under a similar mistake, little attention is due to his errors in a matter of chronology. It is surprising that Diodorus should have anti cipated a year, and placed this transaction in the year three hundred and tAventy-seven before Christ. It is still more extra ordinary that Petavius should adopt his error. It appears at first sight as if Diodorus had confounded the departure from Ni cea with that from the Indus, but his narrative does not alloAV this ; and he not only commences, but finishes, the voyage in the year three hundred and tAventy-seven at Salmus\" in the Gulph of Persia. This Avas impossible, for Alexander died in three hundred and tAventy-four before Christ, and the interme diate transactions from the time he received the fleet near Susa, to the hour of his death, are as clearly ascertained as those of any monarch in Europe Avho has reigned Avithin a century.

Fortunately the Monsoons bloA-/ in the same season noAV that they did in the time of Alexander ; and Ave have the date of the month siven us so positively by Strabo and Arrian, that Ave cannot be mistaken in fixing the departure either from Nicea or the Indus. Both these authors folloAved the journals of Aristobulus and Ptolein}% and the information collected by both is so nearly coincident, that Ave cannot doubt their veracity ; in fact, there is but one interme diate report betAveen the author of the Journal and ourselves. Strabo \" fixes the departure from Nicea in the year three hun dred and twenty-seven \" before Christ, a few days before the set ting of the Pleiades; an expression obscure indeed, though pre cise. The ancients had two settings of their constellations, morning and evening, and accordingly Columella\" says, on the thirteenth or tAvelfth of the calends of November, (that is, on the tAventieth or tAventy-sirst of October\",) the Pleiades begin to set at sun-rise ; and a few lines after, on the fifth of the calends of November, (the twenty-eighth of October80,) the Pleiades set. The phrase of Strabo is simple, Avithout the addition of morning or evening, Avhich he adopts upon other occasions ; Ave must therefore apply it to the latter expression of Columella, Which is simple likewise ; reckoning, consequently, the setting for the * Strabo, p. 69t. ,8 Col. lib. xi. cap. 2. \u2022o Blair's Chronology does not mention the \" 23d of October.

In regard to the second departure the year folloAving from the Indus, Ave haA-e the united testimony of Strabo and Arrian with a shade of difference, which; though it might be Avell to reconcile, is not an object of importance. The date of Arrian is the twen tieth of Boedromion ; the date of Strabo is the evening rising81 of the Pleiades , and both profess the authority of Nearchus. Strabo's date may be elucidated by observing, as Salmasius in forms us, that the rising is the appearance of a star after having been concealed by the sun, and the evening rising is^ Avhen it ap pears in the evening on the setting of the sun. The evening rising of the Pleiades is fixed by Columella for the sixth of the Ides, (that is, the tenth of October,) Ave have therefore the in tended sense of our author exhibited in the clearest light. Arrian has given us a fixed day Avith more apparent precision, but with less real information ; for it is Avell knoAvn, to the great vexation of every one who has had to calculate the date of any fact connected Avith Grecian history, that the commencement of the Athenian year is moveable, like our Easter, and may Avan der through as many days from the same cause, the appearance of a full moon.

The day on which this full moon was new, was the commencement both of the Olym- pian and Athenian year, and a year formed on this principle re- quires perpetual calculations of the moon's changes, Avhenever a date is to be reduced to the precision of modern chronology. Fortunately for those Avho are engaged in researches of this kind, the indefatigable DodAvell S4 has given us a series of years Avhich comprehends this epoch. According to his calculation, the third year of cxiiitk Olympiad, which ansAvers to three hundred and twenty-six before Christ, commenced on the sixteenth of July ; and Boedromion, the third month of the year, on the thirteenth of September ; the eighteenth of that month he discards, and consequently the twentieth of Boedromion coincides with the first of October. We have already sheAvn that Strabo's evening- rising of the Pleiades ansAvers to the tenth of October, and if we now prove that Arrian's date is the first of the same month, we have an approximation too exact to suffer Montesquieu's error to mislead us, and perhaps as near as, at the distance of two thousand years, can be expected. Upon referring this question so Mr. Wales\"5, one of the most accurate astronomers of the age, he Avas of opinion that the pre cession of the Equinoxes (Avhich had been suspected) Avas insuf ficient to account for the error, and likeAvise expressed his doubts Avhether the ancients Avere ever accurate in fixing the rising and setting: of their constellations. His doubts Avere aftenvards found to be avcII grounded ; for Salmasius has demonstrated, that in some instances of this kind hardly any tAvo of the ancient astro- *\u2022 Dodwell de Vet.

It is possible, hoAvever, that Strabo's'4 ex- pression may be laxly interpreted to mean about the evening rising of the Pleiades ; for, in a similar instance, the morning setting of the Pleiades (November the 8th) is esteemed the com- mencement of Avinter; after which it is dangerous to sail; but it is not till the eleventh that the kalendar says, Maria clauduntur ; Ave should therefore esteem the rising or setting of the constella- tions as mai king rather the season than the day. If so, there is latitude giA*en to bring him nearer to Arrian : but let the ques- tion be resolved as it may, the deviation is so small, that in neither case Avill it compel Nearchus to perform his voyage in opposition to the Monsoon. As a positive day is giAren by Ar- rian, I shall assume this in preference, and on the authority of DodAvell, fix the departure of the fleet from the Indus for the first87 of October8*, in the year three hundred and twenty-six before Christ ; notwithstanding, the advance of nine days, ac- cording to Strabo, Avould be a more advantageous point to assume. 86 It appears, upon closer examination, that the Greeks did not reckon the rising and setting of the constellations on the same day with the Romans, for Euctemon computes the evening rising of the Pleiades for the 8th of Dius, that is, the 1st of October.

The Monsoon\" is a term so familiar at present, that it is hardly necessary to observe, it signifies, in India, a Avind that bloAVS six months from the north-east, and six months from the south-Avest. This Avind, unknoAvn in the Great Atlantic and Pa cific Oceans, extends, with a variety of inclinations, through all the seas of India from Japan to Madagascar ; its general course only is north-east and south-Avest ; its particular deviations de pend on the position of mountains, capes, and bays, AArhich sometimes obstruct or direct its course ; and near the coast it almost universally gives way to the land and sea breezes, which bloAV alternately every tAventy-four hours. We shall have occa sion to notice all these circumstances during the passage of Ne archus from the Indus to Cape Jask, and shall find authorities to support them. In a collection of papers furnished by Mr. Dalrymple, I have a Journal of Lieutenant M'Cluer, which will enable me to give a better account of the Monsoon in this track, than could have been procured by any other means of information. \" The vessels bound from Malabar to the Gulph of Persia \" usually make Muscat, on the coast of Arabia ; and the best \" time for making this passage is during the months of Novem \" ber, December, January, and February *\u00b0.\" This proves that the 89 This word signifies any thing which re- Rose ; and Mousem-a-Bulbul, the Season of turns at a stated period, and ought to be writ- the Nightingale; Metaph. for the Season at ten Mousem.

John Thornton says9\", \" In November, December, January, Avhile \" the Avind is northerly within the tropic, it is easterly along the \" coast of Mekran, Avith a current setting to the westAvard.\" And another navigator 9* in this track says, \" Between the latter \" end of October and the middle of November, the land and \" sea breezes 93 begin along the coast of Guadel, (Mekran,) and \" continue four months.\" He adds, \" If a land Avind bloAvs \" either morning or evening, a ship may depend on a sea breeze, \" or at least a Avind along the coast from the north-Avest, to bring \" her in shore again 94 ; neither is the land or sea breeze ever at- \" tended Avith squalls of thunder or rain.\" Tavernier95, Avho made this voyage himself from Ormus to Surat, mentions, that the passage is made during November, December, Janu ary, and February, from Surat to the Gulph of Persia, in fif- teen or twenty days. It has been thought necessaiy to detail these circumstances, in order to sheAv that if Nearchus sailed, as he did, at the be ginning of October, Avhy it Avas necessary for him to Avait tAven ty-four days in port, near Cape Monze, (Eirus, or Irus,) till the Monsoon was settled in November ; he had then every circum stance in his favour, an easterly wind setting along the coast, a land breeze to give him an offing, Avithout danger of being car- 91 P. 71. serene in the N.

Whether Nearchus Avas apprised of all these Co-operating cir cumstances may be doubted ; but there is great reason to believe, that the navigation Avas practised, at least in detached portions of the voyage, if not along the Avhole coast ; and avc may be sure, if he found at Patala any pilot90 capable of conducting him, neither his OAvn foresight nor the prudence of Alexander Avould haAre been wanting to procure assistance. The general effect of the Monsoon he certainly knew ; he Avas a native of Crete, and a resident at Amphipolis, both Avhich lie Avithin the track of the annual or Etesian Avinds, Avhich, commencing from the Helles pont, and probably from the Euxine, SAveep the Egean sea, and stretching quite across the Mediterranean to the coast of Africa97, extend through Egypt to Nubia or Ethiopia. Arrian has accordingly mentioned the Monsoon by the name of Etesian Avinds ; his expression is remarkable, and attended with a precision that does credit to his oavii accuracy, and the authorities from Avhich he dreAV his information. These Etesian Avinds, says he, do not bloAv 9S from the north in the summer months, as Avith us in the Mediterranean, but from the south \". 96 He did find a pilot at Mosarna, which, at the same time it proves a navigation carried on by the Persians, Karmanians, or more probably the Arabians, along the coast, is sufficient to assure us that if a pilot was pro curable at Patala, he certainly would have been employed. 98 And in another place ; the Etesian winds, which prevail the whole summer season, blowing from the sea upon the coast, ren der navigation impraccicable, p. 33$. The mouths of the Indus front exactly south west. 99 This passage of Arrian is accompanied, in the edition of Gronovius, by a long and angry note, as too many of his are. He in terprets his author, however, as intending to say, that as the Etesian winds in the Mediter ranean blow from the north in summer, and 97 A vessel going up the Nile has always in these months a fair wind against the stream.

This setting of the Pleiades must again cause some confusion, for though Gronovius, in his Commentary on Arrian, fixes this for the eleventh of November, because the kalendar says, navi- gation ceases on that day ; )*et Columella places the setting on the twenty-eighth of October, and the morning setting on the eighth of November. We shall prefer, on this occasion again, the setting as expressed simply by both authors, and fix the change of the Monsoon as intended by Arrian for the tAventy- eighth of October ; a da}r Avhich coincides so nearly Avith modern observation, and so identically Avith the circumstances ofthe voyage, as to give it a fixed preference to all others. Arrian is not so happy in limiting the termination of the Monsoon to the Avinter solstice 10\u00b0, for it has been already sheAvn, that it continues to bloAV during January m and February, and does not fluctuate till March; so far is this, hoAvever, from impeaching Arrian of ignorance, that it is a proof of his attention and veracity. The fleet reached Karpella before the end of December ; Nearchus had consequently no opportunity of observing the prevalence of the Monsoon after the winter solstice ; he delivered, therefore, what he kneAV to be true from his OAvn experience, Avithout con sidering or knowing what the Avinds Avere in January and Febru ary ; and Arrian copied as faithfully as Nearchus related. are generally succeeded by an opposite wind in winter, the reverse takes place in the Indian ocean ; the summer Etesian is south, the win ter north. \"\" See B. de Sainte Croix, Notelxii. p. 319, who says, -ra_ rpovras h x^t^ii means the vernal equinox.

It is not, hoAvever, our object to display the advances made in later ages, but to specify the discoveries of the Mace- donians, and the fidelity of the historian ; yet Ave cannot avoid mentioning some particulars that occur in the navigation I03 of the Indian ocean, which bears the name of Arrian, and which, as Dr. Robertson says very justly, deserves more attention than has hitherto been paid to it by geographers. That it is not the work of our Arrian is evident, for the author is ignorant of the extent of Alexander's conquests, Avhom he supposes to haAre ad- vanced to the Ganges, Avhen in reality he passed little beyond the eastern mouth of the Indus. His errors, howeverj are pardon- able, if Ave consider him, as Avhat his Avorks declare him, a mer- chant, or navigator in the seas he describes ; as one Avho had personally visited both coasts of the Red Sea, the coasts of Africa and Arabia, and the coast of Malabar from the bay of Cutch, possibly to the kingdom of Calecut : that we are au- thorised to assume this, is evident from a passage Avhere he says, \" In sailing down the Gulph of Arabia we keep our course in \" the middle ; and, upon another occasion, we sail nearer the \" coast of Arabia.\" The adoption of the first person seems con clusive, and as his description includes Cape Gardafui, (Ardma- 103 peripluS Maris Erythr\u00e6i, in Hudson's Col.

To pursue this inquiry may be thought an intrusion upon the province of Dr. Robertson, but there is much curious matter in this tract that he has left untouched, and some circumstances haA^e escaped his notice Avhich are matter of sur prise. Dr. Robertson has not demonstrated that the Ptolemies had an immediate intercourse with India ; he supposes, on the authority of this Periplus, that vessels did pass from the Red Sea by coasting along Arabia and the Mekran to India. I am willing to accede to this supposition upon the same authority, but I have searched for farther evidence I07 in vain ; and as Dr. \"\u2022\u00ab Cava-Canim, d'Anville ; Cape Far taque, Robertson. ment. It is curious to find this name as old as the time of the author. Deckan signifying south, and Abad, a city ; Dachanabades sig nifies the capital of the south. Where to place this is indifferent ; as, if we were speaking of modern times, we might doubt whether we should call Poonah, Aurungabad, or Seringa patam, the principal city of the south. The reigning prince took the name of his city or province. The modern Deckan is the country of the Nizam, his capital Aurung abad. 105 Cambay is at the head of the Gulph of that name, and was a place of high importance when the Portuguese first reached India. It is now sunk under the ruin of the empire, but is properly the emporium of Guzerat, and the English East India Company were rather dis posed to put it under their protection, and re invigorate it in 1794, as I learn from a very curious paper of Mr. Griffith's. \"** His term is Dachanabades.

After Dr. Ro bertson has laboured the point as much as it will bear, he concludes thus : It is probable that their voyages were circumscribed within very narrow limits, and that under the Ptole mies no considerable progress was made in the discovery of India.

It is not, hoAvever, by this meant to infer, that no ves sels from Egypt ever circumnavigated Arabia into the Gulph ot Persia, or penetrated into India ; for there is great reason to sup pose they visited both, and explored likewise the coast of Africa ; but the silence of authors, and the little \"s said upon the subject by the writer of the Periplits, afford strong presumptions to con clude that these voyages Avere not frequent\"7; that Indian com modities were chiefly purchased in Arabia ; and that the Romans had the good fortune to reap all the advantages from the disco very of Hippalus, to destroy the old channels of commerce, and appropriate the neAV one Avholly to themseh^es.

Elius Gallus un dertook his expedition under Augustus, and if he opened this navigation, the discovery of Hippalus under Claudius established it. The Avhole of this, indeed, is contrary to Mr. Bruce's sys tem\"1; he has, hoAvever, upon this occasion, so much hypothe sis, and so little of historical fact, that I am not bound to fol- Ioav his conjectures, in order either to confirm or refute them. What use the Ishmaelites made of the Monsoon, or Iioav the Ptolemies profited by it, is problematical ; but the discovery of Hippalus is a fact ; and though he is barely mentioned by Pliny, avc have a distinct account of him from the author of the Peri- plus. He informs us, that small vessels had formerly made a coasting passage from Cana, near Cape Fartaque, in Arabia, to the Indus ; but Hippalus observing the site of the emporia, and the appearance \"2 of the sea, ventured upon a navigation across the ocean at the season of the south-Avest Monsoon ,lJ.

Ptolemies ; and it is natural to conclude, that, existing in this manner, it Avas far more profitable to purchase Indian commo dities in the ports of Arabia, than to fetch them from India by a naA'isation so hazardous and circuitous. I have been led into this disquisition, hoAvever unnecessary it may appear, first, because it seems a point not sufficiently at tended to, or noticed by former AArriters ; and secondly, because it attaches to the voyage of Nearchus in a very extraordinary manner. The coast of the Mekran, (Gadrosia,) which had not been heard of in Greece before the time of the Macedonians, Avas visited but little on account of commerce, and perhaps not at all, except by the feAv A7essels Avhich performed those coasting voyages just mentioned, and AArhich probably never touched at any port on it, unless from necessity. As late, therefore, as the time of Strabo, that is, at the distance of three hundred and fifty years, no fresh intelligence had reached the writers of Greece or Rome. Strabo gives much the same account as Nearchus ; but a period afterwards arrived, and to all appearance after the disco very of Hippalus, when this coast was again visited; for Ptole my, who lived in the reign of Adrian \"\\ by residing at Alexan dria, had the opportunity of making inquiries upon the spot. Some merchants and navigators evidently in his age frequented this coast, for he does not draAV his materials from Strabo, Ar rian, Nearchus, or Onesicritus^ but exhibits a varied list of names and situations, in the arrangement of Avhich he is folloAved, Avith little deviation, by his copyist Marcian of Heraclea. But hoAv ever some feAv individuals might furnish information to the geo- Anno C. 138,"], [99, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 51 grapher, the discovery of Hippalus noAv diverted the general course of navigation to the richer coast of Malabar. There Avas no occasion, and little inducement, to visit the Mekran ; and' consequently there is a chasm of silence on this subject in almost every geographer,- voyager-, and traveller, from the time of Pto lemy till the period when the Portuguese penetrated again to this coast of desolation. But though the Portuguese formed settlements in this country, Ave find little distinct information in their accounts ; and if the English East India Company had not directed a survey of this coast to be made, the expedition of Nearchus could not have been properly illustrated, nor the nar rative of Arrian so fully vindicated, as it may noAv be, from the charge of imposture. IX. THE STADIUM. The application ofthe circumstances attendant upon the Mon soon, to the voyage undf r contemplation, has been an easy and a pleasant task ; and if ;\". Avere possible to arrange the measures used by our author, and the distances assigned, with the same accuracy, the journal might be presented to the reader with as much precision as a modern voyage : but no accuracy of this kind is to be expected ; the subject surveyed under a variety of lights, and measures examined by most numerous combinations, afford only a general result approximating to perspicuity, but nothing which will satisfy a mind habituated to research, or the curiosity of those readers avIio consult the margin of their map as regularly as the country it contains. The determination of local situation, by means of longitude and latitude, is at present conducted with so much facility, and ii 2"], [100, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 52 is so familiar to our apprehension, that vre are liable to forget the difficulties to Avhich the ancient geographers were exposed. Narratives and itineraries were the original guides for deter mining distances and positions : these all depended upon mea sures, the measures of different countries differ, and the measures of the same country vary in different ages, and in the calcula tion of different authors. This is so peculiarly the case with the Greek stadium, that it is in some degree indefinite, unless ap preciated by the age and country of the author, or reduced by some standard applicable to the country under consideration. It is this measure which Arrian has adopted, Avith Avhat laxity may be readily seen by consulting Mr. d'Anville's Treatise on the Itinerary Measures of the Ancients ; and if, by the assist ance of that able geographer, some general estimate can be formed, it is such as must be a result from the Avhole, and must not be expected to apply in every particular instance. Extra ordinary as it is to us Avho live in times Avhen, by means of the press, new acquisitions of knoAvledge are diffused throughout Europe in the course of a feAv months, it is a certain fact, that before this communication took place, authors \"s of the same age in different countries kneAv as little of each other's discoveries as if they had not existed. Arrian and Ptolemy are nearly con temporary, and yet so far is Arrian from manifesting any know ledge of longitude or latitude as applied by Ptolemy to the plane or the sphere, that he seems ignorant even of the parallel of Eratosthenes, though he is an author quoted by himself. He makes but one attempt to mark the course of the fleet, by men tion of the shadoAv falling to the south \"6, and unfortunately the **\u2022- Gossellin, p. 27. ,!6 This will be noticed in its place."], [101, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 53 Avhole track of Nearchus is to the nortinvard of the tropic- But though Arrian has conveyed or preserved no discovery of this sort, he is still a faithful transcriber from his authorities ; the standard measure, therefore, which he has used, Ave may be assured, is such as he found it in Nearchus, and the valuation of his stadium becomes the object of inquiry. Mr. d'Anville \"7 says Avith great justice, that none of the ancient measures re quire more discussion than the stadium ; he specifies four dif ferent sorts, and these Avill admit of variations.

It requires great confidence in our guide to acquiesce in this assertion, for no stadium of fifty-one toises is mentioned even by Aristotle himself; it is extracted from him by inference, and the inference itself is extraordinary. The circumference of the earth Avas estimated by Eratosthenes at tAvo hundred and fifty two thousand 12g stadia, Avhich gives seven hundred to a degree ; \u00ab< Mes.

This sum divided by three hundred and sixty produces one thousand one hundred and eleven ; and if Ave reckon one thousand one hundred and cleA-en stadia to a degree, the stadium can contain only fifty-one ln toises. Noav the truth seems to require, that Ave should examine Avhether Aristotle intended to give a larger world or a less stadium, be fore Ave accede to the inference deduced. If, however, Ave Avere once persuaded that Aristotle had adopted a stadium of this kind, Ave might find a philosophical reason for the adoption of it by Alexander ; for his instruction to Beton and Diognetus to employ it in their surveys ; and for bur finding it in the journal of his officers. The philosopher Avas the preceptor of Alexan der ; and if he had any hypothesis of his oavii to establish, by an admeasurement of a neAv invention, it is not impossible that the pupil might have adopted the system of his master, either from deference to his talents, or from ambition, because it Avas neAv.

De C\u0153lo, I imagine d'Anville is totally misled ; for before Eratosthencs's attempt to measure a degree of a great circle, all the measures of the circum ference of the earth were conjectural. How much all was conjecture may be seen by this very chapter, so far as it regards Thales, Anaxagoras, Anaximander, &c. The stadium, therefore, is not dcterminable by reducing the measure of Aristotle, 400,000, to that of Era tosthenes's 252,000, for no such measure was known in the age of Aristotle, but a vague calculation by the Gnomon, Sec. &c. *3' De C\u0153lo, lib. i. c. 14.

I object to all measures of this stadium taken Avhere Nearchus himself did not navigate ; and I hesitate about the measure of 3300 stadia from the mouth of the Euphrates to Babylon, stated as the assertion of Nearchus. Indie, p. 357- For that sum makes only 206 miles, Avhereas it is in reality near 400 miles Roman by the course of the river ; and consequently the stadia of eight to a mile are more correspondent. In order to examine this question more intimately, I extracted all the several distances in Pliny I34, d'Anville, and Rennell, from the Caspian Straits to the junction of the Jumna and Ganges ; and though this stadium Avould not accord Avith Pliny,. calculated either Avay, it approached nearer to Major Rennell's distances, than Mr. d'Anville's OAvn, upon the whole extent of the line; and as Major Rennell is the more correct, the coincidence is still more in its favour. In pursuing the same mode of comparison through the voyage of Nearchus, though it is not possible to establish a proportion of part to part, or perhaps to measure five hundred stadia in any detached portion of the course Avith satisfaction, yet so far do the errors correct one another, that it Avould be ungenerous not to acknoAvledge Mr. d'Anville's merit in the discovery of this principle, however Ave may hesitate about the application of it, to the minuter divisions of the voyage. 133 Tieffenthaler reckons by miles, but his the same ? miles are cosses, equal to i^ths of a mile.

The distance from the northern mountains Avhere the Indus issues, to its junction Avith the sea, Arrian estimates, from the account of Eratosthenes, at thirteen I3S thousand stadia ; the same space on Major Rennell's map gives by the opening of the compasses someAvhat more than thirteen degrees of latitude ; we have then at once a thousand stadia to a degree, and may Avell make up an hundred and eleven more, by alloAvance for the course of the river-, or the march of armies ; and if, by the same proportion, Ave measure from the sea to Nicea, or Jamad on the Chelum, Ave find someAvhat more than nine degrees, or about six hundred and twenty-five miles English, Avhich, with alloAvance for the course of the river, Ave may extend to eight hundred and fifty I3S or eAren nine hundred miles. The second distance given is the coast of the Arabit\u00e6 from the harbour of Krokala to the river Araba, estimated by Arrian at a thousand stadia, and measuring by Mr. Dalrymple's scale about seventy-five miles. The third division is the coast of the Orit\u00e6 from the river Araba to Malana, one thousand six hundred stadia, according to Arrian, and nearly ninety-eight miles by Mr. Dalrymple's \u2022scale. The fourth division is the coast of the Icthuophaoi from Ma lana to Badis ; that is, from Cape Maran, or Malan, to Cape Jask, which Arrian reckons at ten thousand stadia, but nis tot.al and particulars are at A^ariance. Of this coast Ave have a sunrey by Lieutenant Robinson, and according to his scale it measures nearly four hundred and eighty miles, a distance more dispro portionate to Arrian's stadium than any of his former divisions Indie, p. 3 1 <;. \"6 Major ilenneli reckons the navigation up toTMoultan at eight hundred miles."], [105, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 57 for it differs no less than an hundred and forty-five miles ; the inaccuracy of Avhich Ave can only excuse on account of the ex treme distress of the fleet. The fifth division is the coast of Karmania from Cape Jask to the island Keish or Katea; the number of stadia given by Arrian is three thousand seven hundred, but his estimate is lax, and the deduction from it dubious. The coast measures some- Avhat less than tAvo hundred and eighty miles English by Mr. d'Anville's scale. The last measure Ave can ascertain is that of the coast of Persis ; and even here Arrian's statement of four thousand four hundred stadia must be augmented by an alloAvance for four omissions, Avhich cannot make it amount to less than four thousand seven hundred '\" stadia, betAveen Keish and the river Endian, the Katea and A'rosis of Arrian. Mr. d'Anville's scale makes this space equal to three hundred and tAventy-three miles, but from the later information of Mr. Dalrymple's charts there is reason to think it not less than three hundred and fifty miles English.

I am sensible, hoAvever, that several of the modern distances are liable to objection, and I lay no claim to precision on this head ; but they Avere taken in the best manner the charts and maps alloAved, Avithout any regard to the issue, and the result per mitted to come out in its natural course, without previous ac commodation. One circumstance Avhich may appear erroneous is, in my estimation, the natural means of reconciling the tAvo accounts more nearly to truth ; that is, I have reckoned ten degrees of longitude from the Indus to Cape Jask by the same scale as the other distances, Avhich are in reality degrees of latitude ; Avhereas a degree of longitude, in latitude 25\u00b0, is in fact about sixty-two miles, instead of sixty-nine and an half. The difference Avhich this causes upon ten degrees is not more than sixty-five miles ; but if it be considered that the stadia. of Arrian arise from the course ofthe fleet, Avhile the modern miles are estimated, in some measure, from the opening of the com passess, sixty-five ,38 miles upon ten degrees, instead of being an error, is an approximation to truth. Actual precision I affect not, neither do I think the question capable of being reduced to demonstration. ?8 The correction of this distance I owe to the kindness of Dr. Falconer of Bath"], [107, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 59 Upon the Avhole, Mr. d'Anville has performed an essential service to ancient geography, in pointing out a measure of any sort Avhich can enable us to form an estimate of the distances recorded in the journal ; and Avhether it be a stadium of Aris totle, or taken from any standard of the Indians ; nay even if it Avere imaginary, or built only on an analysis of the several measures specified, it is still an object of importance to find this answer upon a space of almost tAvo thousand miles ; and that the unavoidable errors Avhich arise upon the reckonings of all navigators, more especially the ancient, can be made to correct each other mutually, and produce a general result Avhich is admissible. Tavo considerations arise naturally from the discussion of this subject ; the first regards Nearchus, Avhose estimation rises in proportion, not only to the difficulty, but the length of the Aroyage. It is no ordinary degree of fortitude Avhich could enable a commander to undertake this expedition in vessels very in adequate to the service, and to explore a coast of this extent, Avhere, if shipAvreck were avoided, famine Avas perpetually to be apprehended. The second consideration respects the general difficulty of re concilina* the measures of different countries ; no one has laboured this point Avith the same diligence and success as d'Anville, and I am obliged to follow his measure in toises, because if I desert it, I can find no guide to direct me ; but, in fact, even his measures, hoA\\rever carefully reduced, still leave some obscurity behind. Since the publication of this Avork in 1797, the geography of Herodotus by Major Rennell, and the Periplus of the Euxine Sea by Dr. Falconer, have been given to the Avorld, both con- 1 2"], [108, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 60 taining dissertations on the stadium. Major Rennell (sect. 2.) expressly combats the short stadium of d'Anville, and conse quently all that is here advanced on the authority of that ex cellent geographer ; for he Avrites, (p. 30.) \" The stade of Near- \" chus, from the abstract of his journal, in parts Avhere Ave have \" been able to folloAV him, is of a standard somewhat longer \" than that arising from Pliny, for it amounts to 729 to a \" decree.\" 6 I conclude that Major Rennell neA'er honoured my Avork Avith a perusal, othenvise he must have seen that there was no part ofthe journal of Nearchus Avhere we could not folloAV him, ex cept on the coast of Susiana. I do appeal, therefore, to the statement above, (p. 52,) Avhere I collect 31,000 stadia from. six distances given by Arrian himself139 ; and I repeat the assertion, that 31,000 Olympick stadia produce nearly 3650 miles English, and 31,000 of Aristotle's stadia amount to nearly 1914 of the same miles. Which of these tAvo sums corresponds best with the actual measurement of the coast is left to the judgment of the reader. But Major Rennell's stadium of 729 to a degree is not the Olympick stadium ; and he adds, that the Olympick stadium Avas never an itinerary standard measure of the Greeks, (p. 32.) This is so extraordinary an assertion, Avhen the comparison of the Roman mile Avith eight Greek stadia is the uniform position of all authors Avho mention it, that Ave can hardly conceive on Avhat foundation it is built. But he has tried the Olympick stadium by the intervals betAveen different places, and finds that 13 The first, in fact, is not given from Arrian, but measured on Major Rennell's map. 4"], [109, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 61 it does not correspond ; and yet Dr. Falconer has taken the same intervals, and reduced them almost to a coincidence. The fact is, that no road measures are mathematically correct, and all computed distances differ from the standard.

If the Olympick stadium Avas not a standard I4\u00b0 measure, there was no standard in Greece ; for the stadium bears a proportion to all the other measures of length, and they must all stand or fall together.

The result of his inquiry proves, that if the foot English Avere divided into 1000 parts, the Roman foot Avould be equal to 967 of such parts, and the Greek foot to 1007 with a small fraction. This proportion makes the Roman foot to the foot Greek as 24 to 25, the stadium of 600 feet Greek equal to 625 feet Roman, and 6*00 Greek stadia or 75 mile6 Roman equal to a degree of a great circle. It is this difference of 25 feet upon 600 which has caused such a variety of opinions relative to the eight stadia attributed to the Roman mile in general, and the eight stadia one-third which, Strabo I43 informs us, Polybius required to reduce the proportion of the mile to that of the stadium. This difference may be stated under tAvo different processes, which seem to terminate hi the same conclusion ; for, first, if 600 feet Greek are taken at the usual estimate of eight stadia to a mile, the amount is 4800 feet ; but it requires 5000 Roman feet to a mile, for a mile is (mille passus) 1000 paces J44, and every pace is five feet. Here then is the difference of 200 feet, or the third of a stadium, which Polybius calls the double plethron, and a plethron is 100 feet. Secondly, Let us take this in another form ; that is, there are eight stadia in a mile but the stadium of 600 feet Greek, measured by Roman feet, 143 Strabo, lib. vii. p. 322. 'fi; .)

The latter process is adopted by Dr. Falconer, and to all ap- pearance gives a full solution ofthe question. If, therefore, Ave obtain a perfect knoAvledge of the Olympick stadium, Avith its proportion and correspondence to all the other measures ; to maintain that one or all of them are not standard measures, is to abrogate the use of all Greek measurement Avhatsoever. Major Rennell, however, cannot find that the distances given betAveen various places accord with the Olympick stadium ; and by a result from the comparison of eight different authors, he forms an average of 718 feet as the common stadium of Greece. But to estimate the standard I4S by the interval, instead of the interval by the standard, though it is common to most Avriters on the question, is not the best way of proceeding ; for though it is true-, that in the Roman provinces AAhere the miles Avere measured, this process Avill in general ansAver, (hoAvever, as d'Anville observes, it may fell short of geometrical precision,) still in Greece, where there Avas no such practice, Avhere if any interval Avas measured, it Avas not marked ; should the com- putation differ from the standard, it Avould not prove there was no standard, but that the computation itself Avas erroneous* Major Rennell is forced to confess that Herodotus made use of a different stadium for Egypt and the Euxine Sea ; but may 145 In one sense it would always be best to and European mathematicians ; and is now said form the standard from the interval ; that is, if to be reduced to precision by the French cal we could find a precise interval in nature.

A de gree of a great circle is estimated by Eratosthenes at 700 stadia, and at 500 by Ptolemy ; if the stadia, therefore, be the same, (Avhich they are,) the circumference of the Avorld upon one sup position Avould be 31,500 miles, and upon the other only 22,500. BetAveen scientific men in modern times the disagreement appears still more extraordinary. The direct distance betAveen Pisa and Athens, on d'Anville's map, according to Major Ren nell, is 105 Greek miles. \" I have tliat map uoav before me,\" says Dr. Falconer, \" and this distance measures upon it 990 Olympick stadia, or 123 Greek miles and three-fourths.\" Upon such different assertions as these I am not competent to decide ; but I have introduced them for the purpose of shewing hoAv seldom precision is attainable even by men qualified for the at tempt ; and consequently, that the measure applied by d'Anville to the journal of Nearchus is to be judged by its approximation, and no strict accuracy to be required. D'Anville has called this a stadium of 51 toises, or of 111 to a degree. I am ready to agree Avith Major Rennell that no such stadium Avas knoAvn, and that the inference from Aristotle's \u25a0->6 Pers\u00e6 sch\u00e6nos et parasangas alii alia \u00ab\u00ab So Pliny, lib. ii. c. 112.

I said in the former edition of this Avork, that I thought it an Indian measure, ob tained by Nearchus from the natives at the Indus, or the pilot he engaged at Mosarna. I think so still ; and have been disap pointed in not finding an equivalent measure in any of the writers on India whom I have consulted ,4\\ But that such a measure does correspond generally Avith the Journal of Nearchus, I am persuaded ; and that it does not correspond Avith the History of Arrian, I have likewise sheAvn. The reason of this I apprehend is, that in the Journal, Arrian folloAvs Nearchus I49 ; in the History, he takes the usual Olympick stadium like other authors. M. d'Anville has sheAvn, that in the gulph of Persia Pliny read the same number of stadia as Arrian found in Nearchus ; and that, by estimating these at eight to a mile, he makes the distance nearly double what it is in reality. I can exemplify the same fact at the commencement of the voyage ; for avc have the distance of ten nautical miles given us between the Lari bundar River and Crotchey Bay in Captain Prittie's chart, and this is estimated at 150 stadia by Arrian. Now 150 stadia -of '^ There is a dissertation on Indian measures in the Lettres Edifiantes, torn. xv. p. 172. Ed. 17S1.

In this instance, therefore, the usual stand ard of the Greek stadium may be assumed of 600 feet. See Nearchus, first edition, P* 53\u00b0- Plin. lib. vi. c. 21 or 2**. Hard. He gives us likewise 12 miles to Bibaga or Bibacte, and 1 1 to Toraliba, the latter I have not the means to measure. But all the three prove that Pliny had seen the original journal of Nearchus, as well as the extract from it in Juba ; and that Nearchus did record the names of the several stations as well as distances, which in another passage he seems to deny. See Dodwell, and K"], [114, "PRELIMINARY DISQUISITIONS. 66 51 toises produce 7750 toises ; someAvhat more than 10 Roman miles. But Pliny, by computing these in Olympick stadia of eight to a mile, calls this interval 20 miles ; that is, if we take the mile Roman at 756 toises, and multiply these by 20, Ave have 15120 toises, a sum nearly double, or 20 miles instead of 10. Is it not evident then that both Arrian and Pliny KO read the same number of stadia in Nearchus, but computed them by a different estimate ? I shall have other opportunities of comparing the numbers and distances of Pliny in the progress of the Avork ; but in this instance the proof is so direct, that I consider it as conclusive, and have no hesitation in subscribing to the stadium of 51 toises assigned to the journal by d'Anville, Avhether it be considered as a Greek or Indian standard : for hoAvever it may fail in particular instances, the errors upon the whole compensate for each other so generally, that the assump tion has every probability in its favour. On the coast of the Icthuophagi, Avhere it corresponds least, the failure is in the excess even of this small stadium ; for the coast is in reality but 480 miles English, and the stadia are 10,000. These at eight to a mile Avould stretch the account to 1250 miles ; or even at sixteen to a mile, amount to 625, and still have an excess of 145 miles.

I shall conclude this book Avith a defence of the journal of Nearchus as preserved by Arrian, which has been condemned as spurious by Dodwell, and impeached in point of veracity by Hardouin ,s2 and Hues53. The supporters of its credit, hoAv ever, are Salmasius, Usher, Sainte Croix, Gossellin, and d'An ville ; and after the mention of their names, if a neAv apology should be thought superfluous, I must plead the necessity of defending my oavii opinion independently of others ; for if I had thought the Avork spurious, I Avould neither have contributed to support an imposture, nor bestOAved the labour of years upon the elucidation of a Romance. But Nearchus has experienced a fate severe in the extreme ;. he is joined by Strabo with Daimachus IS4, Megasthenes, and Onesicritus, as a retailer >5S of fables, in his account of India , and his Avork has been robbed of its existence, on the authority of Pliny, whose OAvn narrative is far more objectionable. In conducting this charge, DodAvell \"* has not acted generously in prefixing the particular passage of Strabo to the publication of the journal ; for as this bears hard upon the veracity of Near chus, it is prejudging the cause, and ought not to have been in troduced Avithout, at the same time*, stating the evidence on the ,5' I am indebted to Dr. Schmeider of Halle for a very elegant and accurate translation of this Disquisition into Latin, published in his edition ofthe Indica, 1798. 152 Hominis mirare in mendaeiis confingen dis audaciam.

Justice required it to be noticed that Strabo has copied this journal as evidently as Arrian, and that he is in debted to Nearchus for many facts Avhich, however extraordinary they might appear in his age, have been confirmed by modern observation. Arrian, it is true, speaks of an enchanted island, and a mira culous origin of the Icthuophagi ; not indeed Avith a view to assert the truth of such trash, but to refute it ; and if Nearchus mentions himself as the only man in the fleet Avho did not fear enchantment, it may prove his vanity or self-importance, but cannot impeach his veracity. Two circumstances only occur Avhich can be adduced to sup port such an imputation ; one is, his extravagance in stating '\" the breadth of the Indus ; the other, his error in asserting that at. Malana, in November, the sun in the meridian Avas seen to the north. The former may be rescued from the charge of falsehood, by supposing that it relates to the river in a state of inundation ; and if the latter admits of no satisfactory solution, it ought not, as standing alone, to be insisted on, to the \"in validation of the Avhole Avork. Dodwell, in reality, has paid no 157 This charge falls rather upon Arrian than Persia, returned to Scherauze from his pil grimage to Mecca, and was introduced to Lust Ali Khan, the then Prince of Persia.

The Baron de Sainte Croix has drawn out the arguments of this great critic, and subjoined an ansAver to each ; but as the whole charge rests upon a single line of Pliny, if it can be proved that the passage itself is inconsistent Avith Pliny's assertion in other places, and that Dodwell has not explained it in a satis factory manner, not only the principal argument, but all the collateral inductions fall to the ground. Sainte Croix proposes to correct it by a different reading, which turns the negative into an affirmative ; a liberty, which, though not supported by authority, may be justifiable in regard to a text so corrupt as Pliny's ; but I shall sIicav that it is incompatible ; and therefore, if it is incapable of correction, it must be rejected altogether. The passage in Pliny is8 is this ; \" The journal of Onesicritus *' and Nearchus contains neither the names of places Avhere \" they anchored, nor the measure of distances.\" Could any one after this suppose, that the folloAving tAvo-and-tAventy lines, which comprehend Pliny's extract of the whole voyage, contain little* else but the names of places I59 ? and these evidently taken, not indeed from Nearchus, nor from the original Avork of Onesi critus, but from the journal of Onesicritus,* published by Juba l6\u00b0 the Mauritanian. 158 Onesicriti et Nearchi navigatio nee nomi- some distances are mentioned in both.

What Pliny found in Nearchus shall be considered presently ; but that he found the names of places in Juba's Onesicritus his OAvn text proves ; and that some of these places, Tuberus, Hy'tanis, &c. Avere mansiones, or anchorages, is equally evident. He has given feAv distances it is true ; and Avhether the journal of Onesicritus contained distances l61 or not, it is impossible to discover ; but that Nearchus specified distances appears not only by his work, AA'hich in this case is no evidence, but by the testimony of Pliny himself upon several other occasions. There is in Strabo a passage thrust into his text as strangely as this assertion of Pliny is inconsistent With the tenor of his assertions. \" Nearchus says, he could obtain no native guides \"or pilots in his course from India to Babylonia, because the \" coast afforded no places to anchor at **, or any inhabitants \" capable from experience, or knoAvledge of the navigation, to \" conduct him.\" This passage stands insulated betAveen tAvo others, with which it has no connection Avhatever ; and how it has intruded itself here seems unaccountable. It contains, however, an expression Avhich has some relation to the assertion of Pliny : \"On Trpoo-op^s?; 4k ejgrf, because it afforded no mansiones. What ? \u2014 not the journal, but the coast ; and some expression of this sort has given rise to Pliny's error. 161 Itineraria continuis mansionibus, man sionumque spatiis.

Might not a se cond DodAvell quote these very Avoids, to prove that Strabo hears evidence against the authenticity of the journal, Avhich records two pilots, Hydriakes from Mosarna, and Amazenes from Oaracta ? This Avould make out a stronger case than Pliny's charge amounts to. But the ansAveris read}\" ; for Strabo contradicts Strabo. He says here, Nearchus had no pilot; and he says afterwards rt4, Amazenes, governor of Oaracta, was the pilot from that island up the Gulph. The ignorance of Pliny himself, or the corrupt state of his text, or the vitiated medium through which he received his in formation, is such, that it is not -easy to discover a relation between the account he gives from Onesicritus and that of Arrian's Nearchus. This also forms one of DodAvell's charges. But Avhether Onesicritus is the cause of this difference, or Avhether it originates from the intervention of Juba, it is not irreconcilable with Nearchus ; for l\\ with some assistance from Salmasius, I read Arbis for Nabrus, Tomerus for Tubcrus ,6S, Orit\u00e6 for Parit\u00e6, Ori gens for Origens, Andanis for Hytanis, Ach\u00e6menidas for Ach\u00e6medinas, Aradus for Acrotadus l67, and perhaps Arbis for ab eis 163. And if I noAv accuse Pliny of ignorance, or his text of corruption, could DodAvell himself, if he were living, defend him ?

These are mentioned merely to sheAv that the credit of Pliny's work ought not to be rated so high as to be made the standard for others, or the test of truth. Another objection DodAvell draAvs from the reckoning by miles, Avhich are Roman, instead of the Greek stadium, and which, if Pliny had copied from a Greek Avork, he Avould pro- bably haAre adopted. Whether Juba reduced the stadia into miles, or Pliny, I pretend not to ascertain ; but that it is the general custom of the latter, Avhenever he extracts from Greek authors, his Avhole work will prove ; and d'Anville, Avith his usual penetration, has sheAvn in a multiplicity of instances that Pliny never considered any variation in this measure, but that, by reckoning indiscriminately eight stadia to the Roman mile, he has incurred errors that are subversive of all geography. D'An- ville has had the curiosity to compare several of these computa- tions by miles Avith the stadia on Avhich they Avere made, and the result has been, that as soon as the measure of the stadium in the author copied Avas ascertained, the numbers I7\u00b0 of Pliny have been reconciled to truth ; truth, of which the Avriter him self Avas not conscious. But Pliny asserts, that there are no measures in Nearchus ; and Avhether he copies his extract from Onesicritus or Nearchus, it is generally without any measure of distances. This may be evidence against Onesicritus, or at least Juba ; but is of no weight in regard to Nearchus, Avhom, hoAvever he may cite in other places, he certainly does not copy in this extract. In other passages, he actually cites the distances I71 of Nearchus.

As a general answer to this, it is sufficient to observe, that this uninterrupted series is an invention of DodAvell's, and we alloAv that Arrian's Avork does contain this sort of series ; but a series commencing at the Indus, and extended to the Euphrates, according generally in its parts, and almost per fectly in its total, Avith the actual survey of the coast, as esta blished by modern observation, contains such internal evidence of its truth, that it is impossible to be invalidated by any hypothetical argument whatsoever. This ought to suffice ; but.I will now adduce the very passages from Pliny cited by DodAvell himself, and make both authors bear evidence against their OAvn system. \" Nearchus I?l says, \" that the coast of Karmania extends twelve hundred and fifty \" miles.\" And again : \" Onesicritus m and Nearchus Avrite, \" that from the Indus to the Gulph of Persia, and thence from \" the marshes of the Euphrates to Babylon, are tAventy-five \" miles.\" In another passage : \" From the commencement of \" Karmania to the river Sabis, an hundred miles ; from hence \" vineyards and arable lands to 'Andanis, twenty-five miles \" more.\" With the account of these distances, corrupted as the text is beyond all conception, I have no concern; but that measures are specified in each separate instance is apparent, and those the measures of Nearchus.

DodAvell himself conjectures, that Pliny had seen the original journal of Nearchus, as Avell as the publication of Juba, because, in the catalogue of the writers Avhom he consulted, he mentions the name of Nearchus ; and from hence it is concluded, that there are no measures in the original, or that Pliny found none ; but it has been proved already that, in the abstract of the voyage, Pliny folloAvs Onesicritus ; and it is noAv demonstrated that, upon reference to Nearchus in other instances, the text of Pliny proves the existence of those very distances he denies. Fair reasoning, therefore, demanded the assent of Dodwell to the solution of Usher\"4, Avho supposes these distances to have existed in the original, and to have been omitted by Juba ; and if this supposition Avill not make Pliny consistent, why is he to be supported ? or why is the existence of other authors to depend upon his suffrage ?

D'Anville'7' has thought it a sufficient answer to all objections to introduce a part of the narrative itself, and present it to the reader in the same form as the author gives it ; and, in fact, the internal evidence of the work speaks more forcibly for itself than all the arguments which can be adduced in its favour. The circumstantial detail of minute facts, the delineation of the coast with the same features it bears at present, the description of manners, customs, and habits, all characteristic of the na tives ; the peculiarity of the climate, seasons, winds, and natural productions, all bespeak a knoAvledge Avhich could have been obtained from actual inspection only, and all present a Avork which EueLnerus, Iambulus, Euthym&nes ,7', and all the forgers of antiquity could not have put together. If it Avere requisite to pursue this inquiry farther, Salmasius affords a copious catalogue of Pliny's errors in regard to the Avhole coast ; and whether those errors arise from the authors he consulted, or his manner of consultation ; Avhether Ave are to impute them to himself, or to the mutilated and corrupt state of the manuscripts as they came into the hands of his editors ; it is impossible that a single passage in such a Avork should be main tained, in order to depreciate, nay, to annihilate a journal, in which accuracy is as conspicuous as the inaccuracy of Pliny is demonstrable.

Notwithstanding, hoAvever, these shades of difference, the aggregate of the tribes appears perfectly Hin doo, from the time that Alexander passed the Indus, till his return to the Orit\u00e6 on the ocean. It is confessed on all hands that Hindoo policy, both civil and religious, favours population, agriculture, and commerce ; and though it va ill be said, upon the authority of Arrian himself9, that the Macedonians found no gold in India, if it is a fact, it can only be alleged to proA^e, not the Avant of wealth, but of the actual metal. But the fact is suspicious ; for the fable IO of gold turned up by ants proves the existence of gold in the country ; and the tribes AvestAvard \" of the Indus subject to Persia, as early as the reign of Darius, paid their tribute12 in gold. Be this, hoAvever, as it may in respect to gold, the Avealth of the people in those early ages is self-evident, from Avorks still ex tant of the most extraordinary magnificence. Their temples, excavations, and public buildings, are not to be seen Avithout astonishment bjr foreigners ; they are by the natives attributed to the agency of supernatural ,3 powers, and all bespeak a com- boar ; caper, a he-goat ; bouc, a goat ; buck, a male deer, &c. __c. : and thus Onesi'critus'3 ant may be a very different animal.

But the tale of the ancients must be a fable. One sicritus saw not the ant indeed, but his skin ; it was as large as a fox's. The truth or falsehood of these reports de pends upon the animal to which the name is attributed. The term ant might have been applied to the ichneumon or armadilla, &c. &c.

This testimony of wealth and poAver is in all probability long anterior to the age of Alexander, and not in the country visited by him ; but in his age, at the sources of the Indus, we obtain such authentic evidence of superior wealth and population, as cannot be contemplated Avithout astonishment. Greece itself was one of the most populous countries of Europe ; and Avhat ever country could, from its appearance, suggest to Greeks an idea of superior population, must exceed in this respect all or dinary calculation.

The legislators seem to have re moved the obstacles to marriage, by holding out an immunity from the burden of a family, and to have trusted to the affections of nature for rearing one. This policy appears to have answered in these two instances.

For the le gislature of France has discovered that popu lation may be too great, and has in consequence taken effectual measures to diminish it. The discovery is imputed to Mirabeau. Mr. Barrow, in his account of China, has disapproved the authority of \u00c6neas Anderson, aud adds, that he himself did not know of any law in China to authorize the exposition of children. What I have asserted in regard to the law, I had from an East India Captain, (I think) Captain M'Namara, who fell at St. Salvador, But if there be no law to prohibit it, it is sufficient for my purpose. In regard to the authority of \u00c6r.eas Anderson, I con sidered him as a writer speaking from what occurred to his own imagination. The mag nificent work of the embassy was not then published. Sir George Staunton has enhanced the population of P. Mailla ; and I still think the feeding ot the Chinese nation more won derful than the number of inhabitants. M. Billecocq, the excellent French transla tor of this work, has, with a degree of pa triotism that is laudable, condemned the author for this note. I cannot now bring the charge home to Mirabeau ; but I am certain that I had read it at the time, and that it is not a calumny of my own invention.

To prevent war is impossible ; but to strip it of its terrors by adopting something similar to this, as a law of na tions \", is a subject for the contemplation of the legislator, of the philosopher, and of every individual, moral or religious. I have entered upon this discussion in order to vindicate the classical historians from the charge of falsehood, by accounting in some measure for the numerous tribes with which this countiy swarmed. Another cause of this may be found in the nature of the country itself; for the five streams which water it are navi gable, during the summer season at least, a thousand miles 3\u00b0 from the mouth of the Indus ; and the Chelum or Hydaspes is said to extend this navigation two hundred miles higher into Cashmeer, from which province there is a communication with Thibet, Boudtan, and Tartary. The western sources connect with Ckndahar and Cabul ; but as these are not our concern at present, it will be sufficient to notice that Lahore on the Ravee, the principal city of the Panje-ab, was the centre 3r of an immense commerce between that country and Dehli ; and that one of the more eastern branches either did communicate 3% or was intended by re- 29 This was a favourite idea of Dr. Frank lin's, who obtained some articles of a similar tendency to be introduced into a treaty between America and Prussia. Unfortunately for the theory, they are two nations least likely of all others to try the effect practically. We no longer eat our conquered enemies, like the New Zealanders or native Americans ; we do not murder them, like the Laced\u00e6 monians ; or reduce them to slavery, like the Romans. Increasing knowledge, mutual fears and conveniencies, morality and religion, have contributed to abolish these practices. What great refinement of speculation is there in car rying this system still farther ? 30 Ten degrees, by the opening of the compasses, from the mouth ofthe Indus to the southern mountains of Cashmeer.

These circum stances are sufficient to prove the commercial spirit of the country ; and, in consonance with this, Abu'l Fazil informs us, that forty 33 thousand vessels were emplo3red on the Indus, which, even in the decline of commerce, are said by Captain Hamilton to be two 34 hundred tons burden, and the most con venient he had seen for the accommodation of the passenger and the merchant. If such has been the state of commerce35 under the empire of the Mahoniedans, it is but reasonable to assume a much more flourishing appearance of it in the earl3r ages, while the Hindoo policy wras in full vigour, uninterrupted by foreign intruders, and unremitting in its encouragement and protection of the people. The population is one proof of this, and the fleet col lected by Alexander is another.

This fact, how ever, as supported by no historian of credit, is utterly dubious. 34 By Mr. Griffith's papers, it appears that vessels of forty or fifty tons only could now be navigated ; a proof that the commerce has de clined, and that the river partakes of the de terioration of the country.

The revenue of all these provinces or soobahs, as settled by Akbar, is exhibited in the Ayeen Akbari; but large as they are, both essentially and relatively, they appear reasonable in comparison of the ancient accounts, whether Greek or Hindoo ; and these accounts, though exaggerated, have doubtless some foundation in fact. All these provinces Avere overrun by the Macedonians, except Cashmeer % the paradise of the Hindoos, consisting, of a large valley in the northern mountains. But Lahore, Moultan, and Tatta\"0, Avhich form the modern soo bahs, are the scene of those transactions we are now to enter upon. That we ma3~ display these in their proper light, and be enabled to follow the operations of the fleet, it is necessary first to shew the series of the rivers which Mr. d'Anville has mistaken **, and which must be reduced to order before a commander of that invasion wrote his name also Maghmoud like the Ghaznavide ; it is probably the provincial dialect for Mohammed. Iswara signifies King, according to Wilsord, As. Res. iv. p. 380, and Ab-Iswara would be a king of a Doo-ab ; but Mr. H. Jones de rives the name from Abou-Shar, which signi fies Father of the city. This, however, is Persian. The whole of this is mere conjecture I allow.; but as the initial Ab intimates his territory to be on a river, by searching for the etymology of Issar, I am satisfied his residence would be discoverable.

II. PANJE-AB, PEXJ-AB, OR PUNGE-AB. The five rivers of the Panje-ab, which fall into the Indus, are in their order commencing from the west, the Hydaspes, the Akesines, the Hydraotes, the Hy'phasis, and the Saranges. Besides these, Arrian, from Megasthenes, brings the Sinarus into the Hydaspes, the Tootapus into the Akesines, and the Neudrus42 into the Saranges ; but of these two last he professes to speak with diffidence, as they Avere not seen by the Mace donians ; and the Sinarus and Tootapus are mentioned no more. Of these five streams the Akesines is the principal, being joined by the Hydaspes on the Avest, and by the Hydraotes from the east, receiving also (as Arrian asserts) both the Hy'phasis, Saranges, and Neudrus, from the east, before it falls into the Indus. Ptolemy causes no small confusion, both to his com mentators, and to Mercator who has framed his maps, by giving the preference to the Hydaspes, and making the name of that river prevail over the others. But Arrian maintains the honour of the Akesines, asserting expressly, that all the others lose their name on uniting Avith him ; and that he preserves this pre-eminence till he joins the Indus. This is the more pro bable, because the modern Chen-ab, his representative, claims the same privilege 43 to the present day. \u2022', It is not quite evident whether into the 4J Tkffenthaler.

In this re spect, therefore, ancient geograph3r is uniform ; and if the mo derns dissent, either from one another or from consistency, we must impute their mistake to that abundance of appellations which all these rivers severally obtain, either in different parts of their course, or from being mentioned b3r various names in various languages, Mogol, Toorki, Persian, or Hindoo.

According to that register it rises in Cashmeer, and is navigable by vessels of tAvo hundred tons quite up to Syrin-nagar, the capital of that province. Where Arrian would bring his Sinarus into this stream, Avhether from the east or Avest, whether within the limits 4S of Cashmeer, or below the mountains, is undis coverable ; but his authority is from Megasthenes, and not from the Macedonians. Neither kneAV any thing of Cashmeer ; and yet in Sinarus I think that I trace some relation to the S37rin nagar *\u2022 river, as it is called, Avithin the limits of that province. HoAvever this may be, the river, after passing the mountains and descending to the Pergunnah of Shoor, joins the Akesines or Chen-ab, and twenty cose s\u00b0 lower receives the Ravee, or Hydraotes,sat Zufferabad ; Avhen the three streams united, after a farther course of sixty cose, form a junction with the Indus at Outche, the Oxy'drac\u00e6 of the Macedonians. This is the ac- 48 It should rather seem below the moun tains ; for he says, in Oxydracis, Outche. But there is no river there but such as we are ac quainted with. *\u00bb Nagar, nagur, nagoor, is a general ter mination, like poor, patam, &c. as Chander nagur. Syrin-nagur is therefore the town, fort, or city, on the Syrin. Syrin and Sinar, Sinar-us, approximate suf ficiently ; but the mention of the Oxy'drac\u00e6 seems adverse to the conjecture. 5\u00b0 The principle of the cose is found in the Ayeen Akbari, vol. ii. p. 213.

The royal cose is the shortest, and the standard for military men suration. Tieffenthaler reckons thirty-two cose to a degree ; and Rennell, p. 5. values a cose at one mile and nine-tenths, i. e. one hundred cose is equal to one hundred and ninety miles.

From the fame authority Ave learn, that the Doo-ab, or tract betAveen the Indus and Hydaspes, is styled Sind-sagur by the Mogols ; and its breadth is estimated at sixty cose, or an hundred and four teen miles. The medium of this breadth is, as far as I can dis cover, taken at the point where the road crosses the Doo-ab, and as such, is to be estimated in the accounts that folloAv. The whole breadth of the Panje-ab, including all the Doo-abs from the Indus to the Satludj, is given at an hundred and eighty cose, or about three hundred and fifty SI miles ; the specific measures make the cose an hundred and eighty-five. Cheref-ed din's account does not differ Sl much from the Ayeen Akbari ; for he mentions, that the Chelum rises from the foun tain Vir, or Syrin-nagar, and after passing the mountains, takes the name of Dindana S3 and Jamad. It then passes into the Genave, and above Moultan both join the Ravee, Avhich passes a second Moultan. The united stream is aftenvards joined by the Biah, and the Avhole body falls into the Indus at Outche. The mention of tAvo Moultans accords Avith our knoAvledge of the ancient Malli and modern Moultan ; and it is remarkable that Cheref-eddin S4 should agree with Arrian in making the Hyphasis or Biah join the Chen-ab before that river joins the Indus.

It is to the credit of Ptolemy that he preserves this sound ; and Avhether Ave take his San-dab-ala from San-ab, or Chan-ab ; or the Avhole Sanda-bala from Chanda bahka, the correspondence with the Sanskreet is equally visible. The Ayeen Akbari *\u00b0 asserts, that Chunder and Bahka are two streams Athich issue from the same mountain in the range called CutAvar or KishteAvar, Avhich unite their waters and their names, and in the latter of these, I conclude, AAre are to look for the Tootapus 6t of Arrian, Avhich, from the authority of Meg&sthenes, he brings into the Akesines at an early part of his course. The Akesines is confessed, both by ancients and moderns, to be the principal of the Panje-ab streams, and his reception of the Hydaspes or Chelum from the Avest, Avith the Hydradtes or Ravee from the east, is confirmed by all. Whether he receives the Biah and Satludj also, or Avhether they join the Indus with out communicating with the Akesines, is^ still a geographical problem. Arrian 62 every Avhere asserts, that the Hy'phasis, Saranges, and Neudrus, that is, the Biah, Satludj, and Caul, pin the Akesines, either by themselves or b3r the intervention of the Hydraotes. But the A3^een Akbari brings them inde pendently 63 into the Indus, considerably beloAv Moultan ; and this is the authority of M. Rennell 6\\ Tieffenthaler, if I under- signify the moon.

M. Rennell is justified in preferring the authority of the Ayeen Akbari to Arrian, as Arrian confesses himself that, beyond the Hy'phasis or Biah, he has no positive 66 evidence to rely on, and he does not folloAv his Macedonian guides, but Megasthenes 6'. Mr. de la Rochette has adhered to d'x\\nville in this particular, and, in the disposition of Avjodin with the parts adjacent, ac- cords better Avith Cheref-eddin's march of Timour, than any other arrangement I have seen. It is extraordinary that d'An- ville, avIio is more likely to err on the side of et3rmology than by a neglect of it, should not have observed that Shan-trou68 rested upon the same root as Shan-ab, his own Tchen-av ; but I have mentioned this error too often. The prerogative of this river, in preserving its name till it joins the Indus, has been already noticed ; and Arrian adds, that it is the only stream of the Panje-ab not fordable at any season of the year, Avhich all the others are, after the cessation of the rains.

The roads from Cabul, Candahar, Attock, and Moultan, all unite at Lahore, as a centre betAveen each respectively and the capital : and the celebrated aArenue extending upAvards of three hundred miles from this city to Dehli, which exists perhaps no longer except in the page of history, bespeaks not merety a communication, but the importance of the intercourse, and the numbers, as much as the luxury, of those avIio travelled b3T this route. The communication on the Avest from Nicea to this city, explored by Alexander, is probably still open. For though \" the road from Attock passes 74 at present through Rotas in a more northerly line, as I shall hereafter shew the relation between Jamad and Nicea, a sovereignty at that island, whether tributaiy or independent, would naturally open a road from thence to a capital like Lahore ; and a line from Attock draAvn through Jamad being more direct than through Rotas, it is not impossible that it Avas the more early means of intercourse. That Alexander realty reached Lahore, and that it existed in his time, there is some degree of proof; for the name Avritten at an early period Lehauer 7S, Avas still more anciently Lack-onore and Lo-pore; and asOnore76 and Pore are terminations expressive of a city or fortress, this will afford a reason Avhy Alexander found 71 See the Map prefixed to the Antiquite Geographique des Indes ; but by his Map of Asie, premiere partie, it is evident he supposes the Akesines to be the modern Ra- Dunkhose Ferry, Chowpcran Ferry on the Attock, lat. 310 35'. 74 Rennell. 75 Ayeen Akbari.

This river Ss rises in the Pergunnah of Shoor, from that part of the northern range called Keloo, and joins the Setledj or Satludj, near Feerouzpoor.

It may be the Caul, which, according to de la Rochette, is de rived from the Setledj, and falls into it again ; or, according to others, has a separate source, and joins the Setledj from the north-east. As Arrian professes his doubt of every thing be yond the Hy'phasis, and Ave are not concerned in reality Avith the Setledj at all, it is not necessary to pursue the inquiry. I shall only add, that Ptolemy joins the Zardrus Ai'ith the Bipasis, that is, the Setledj Avith the Biah, and brings their united stream, not into the Indus, but the Chen-ab95. The province between the Biah and Setledj is styled Bevt Jalindhar, in breadth fifty cose. Such is the detail of the five rivers \"6 ; and when the Ayeen Akbari calls them six, either in the province of Lahore or Moul tan, it ahvays includes the Indus, Avithout any respect to the Setledj, as consisting of two streams.

But after conducting these five streams individually into the Indus, some general observations are necessary to complete our purpose. The sources of all the streams Avhich fall into the main channel of the Indus are to the south of that great ridge called Hindoo Khoo, Avhich separates Tartary from Hindostan ; the Indus itself, according to Major Rennell and the Ayeen Akbari, cuts that chain97, like the Ganges and Burhampooter : its ultimate source is still unknoAvn. The chain of mountains coming from Candahar, the Paropamisus of the ancients, and the seat of the modern AgAvhans or Afghans, takes a SAveep to the north as far as Cabul, and furnishes those streams Avhich fall into the Indus from the Avest. If this chain is cut by the Indus, it toAvers again on the eastern side of that river, and, dividing itself to encircle Cashmeer, emits the Chelum or Hydaspes from its northern ridge, Avhile its southern chain sends forth the Akesines, Hydraotes, and Hy'phasis.

If I could hope for health and leisure to attend this conqueror through his several campaigns, I am persuaded that the geo graphical accuracy of Arrian, Avhenever he folloAvs Ptolemy and Aristobulus, is as demonstrable to the westward of the Indus, as towards the east ; but Avith that at present Ave are not con cerned.

After establishing the several rivers Avith their mutual con nection and relation, let us return to the Hydaspes or Chelum, to search for the position of Nikea. The discovery is not diffi cult ; for though the present road from Attock to Lahore crosses the Chelum at Rotas, and it avouM have been agreeable to the plan already laid down to have conducted Alexander by this route, avc are directed by Arrian Avith so much precision to an other point, that Ave can hardly be mistaken.

He embarked himself in a galley, and conveyed his troops in boats brought over land from the Indus. He had scarcely disembarked them, Avhen he found himself encircled by another channel, which, being SAvelled by the solstitial rains, he forded with great diffi eulty ; then, turning to his right, he folloAved the course of the stream, and, after defeating the son of Porus, advanced to the spot Avhere the king himself had draAvn up his forces opposite to Craterus.

Such an island is found, and situated on a bend of the Chelum or Hydaspes, about tAvent3r eight miles beloAv Rotas, and in a more direct line betAveen Attock and Lahore than Rotas itself. The road probably passed at this place in earlier times, and has been diverted to Rotas only because the island afforded a strong post, which in India is always a source of exaction. This island is called Jamad by de la Rochette, and by Major Rennell in his second Map ; in his first Map it contains a fort named Shah Buldien's '\u00b07 Fort, equi valent, I conclude, to Cheref-eddin's I0S Chehabeddin. It is re markable that Chehabeddin l09 should oppose the progress of Timour, at the distance of sixteen centuries, almost in the very spot where Porus had encountered Alexander. From the re sistance of Chehabeddin, it may be presumed that the island has the advantage of high ground and Avoods, as described b3r dred and fifty stadia from his camp to the island ; by a rude calculation I make it nine miles.

Nikea being the point at which the voyage commences, I shall settle the longitude and latitude of this place by Mr. Gossellin's method of correcting Ptolemy ; and as it is one object of this Avork to reconcile ancient geography with modern, the system of Mr. Gossellin is Avorthy of consideration.

The French toise, however, beino- six feet, and the foot French to the foot English nearly as sixteen to fifteen, the reduction may be easily made by any one who wishes to compare it with the English mile. Let us observe next, that d'Anville reckons seventy-five miles Roman as equal to a degree of a great circle, and then let us inquire Avhether five hundred, six hundred, or seven hundred stadia correspond best with this estimate of a degree. The Roman mile of 75 to a degree produces 56,700 toises. The stadium of 500 47,250 stadium of 600 56,700 stadium of 700 66,150 Hence it appears, that the computation by six hundred stadia to a degree contains exactly the same number of toises as the estimate by the Roman mile, which in fact it ought to do. \"Why, therefore, Mr. Gossellin assumes the stadium of seven hundred to a degree, in order to correct the longitudes of Pto lenry, is a question for discussion. His system \"5 is this, that the chart of Erat6sthenes was upon \"i In the French translation of this work there is a note inserted, pronouncing that the astronomical differs from the Olympic or civil stadium ; and that the former is an aliquot part of the measure of the earth. It is added, that the stadium of 700 to a degree, adopted by Eratosthenes, makes the degree consist of 57,060 toises, not of 66,150, as is here as serted. I have never yet met with this astro nomical stadium ; but I doubt the propriety of measuring the standard by the world, in- stead of the world by the standard ; that is, I doubt whether the ancients adopted this prac tice. But if a degree measured by the astro nomical stadium consist of 57,060 toises, it approaches so nearly to 56,700, that is, the measure of a degree by 600 Olympic stadia, as to come within 360 toises, which is little more than half a toise, or three feet on a sta dium ; a difference hardly requiring a resort to two different stadia for rectification. I have been convinced by the Bishop of St. Asaph,"], [163, "COURSE OF THE FLEET DOWN THE INDUS. 113 a plain \"6, in Avhich his principal parallel passed through Rhodes ; but the chart of Ptolemy was upon a sphere, and as he reckoned five hundred stadia equal to a degree of a great circle, he allowed four hundred to a degree on the parallel of Rhodes. But Mr. Gossellin says, that Ptolemy ought to have alloAved five hundred stadia to a degree on the parallel of Rhodes (for that Avas the estimation of Eratosthenes himself), and to have taken seven hundred stadia to a degree at the equator. The method Mr. Gossellin takes in consequence of this, to correct the longitudes of Ptolemy, is, to multiply the longitude by five hundred, and divide the produce by seven hundred, in order to reduce stadia of five hundred in a degree to those of seven hundred. The success of this experiment is extraordinary ; and having explained the principle it is founded on, I must leave the defence of it to Mr. Gossellin himself. This is, how ever, the mode of calculation in regulating the longitude of the principal places, adopted in the folloAving pages. It is well known that the latitudes of Ptolemy are more cor rect than his longitudes ; and this arose, according to Mr. Gossellin, from his taking seven hundred stadia to a degree of latitude, while he assumed only five hundred \"7 to a degree of longitude. It is not requisite forme to enter into this question, or to inform the reader that a degree of every great circle is equal ; but another difficulty I had to encounter, which was to that I was misled in adopting Mr. Gossellin's calculation ; but as it had been applied throughout the former edition, I could not easily retract it without a general alteration of the work : I have therefore let it stand, but think it right to guard it with this cau tion. Mercator's charts, and the rule given for cal culating the true longitude according to the diminution of the degree of longitude in pro portion to the distance from the equator. \"' This is incorrect.

Schmieder thinks that this consultation with Nearchus took place not at Nikea, but im mediately previous to the sailing of the fleet from the mouth of the Indus ; but to this it may be objected, that Nearchus was evidently declared admiral when all the great officers of the army were named trierarchs or captains of gallies.

Nearchus did not continue at Amphipolis, but came up to the court of Philip, and had so ingratiated himself with Alexander, that, in the family dissensions Avhich arose upon the secession of Oly'm pias, and some secret transactions of her son in regard to a marriage Avith the daughter of Pexodorus, satrap of Caria, '3\u00b0 Bagoas.

This is the officer Avhom Ave are now to accompany ; but if the whole of his journal is preserved by Arrian, there is some reason to complain of the commander for recording all that con tributed to his oAvn glory, and to lament that he did not rescue the fame of his brave folloAvers from oblivion. Hephestion, Leonnatus, Lysimachus, Ptolemy, Craterus, A'ttalus, Peu cestas, and probably many others, had evidently only a tem porary or honorary command ; and the silence of Nearchus in respect to the others throws a degree of uncertainty over the remainder of the catalogue.

The fleet had been built or collected on the Indus, and part of it had been brought over land to the Hydaspes. The num ber of vessels is estimated at two thousand I34 by the historians, including all sorts, from the galley to the tender. The collect ing of such a fleet has been accounted for already, and the pos sibility of conveying great part of it from one river to the other, Avill not appear extraordinary to those who are acquainted with a similar practice at the isthmus of Corinth, or consider that Alexander Avas at the head of an hundred and twenty thou sand Iy' men, and was possessed of treasures, alliances, de pendents, and tributaries, sufficient to command the services of all the native inhabitants of the country, if requisite.

Arrian has given us the breadth of the Hydaspes and several other streams Avhich join the Indus, but informs us, he has the authority of Ptolemy for that of the Akesines alone; that river he estimates at fifteen m stadia, the Hydaspes I4\u00b0 at twenty. The Indus, he says, Avas forty at a medium, and fifteen Avhere nar roAvest; that in its course from the confluence of the Akesines to the Delta of Pattala it Avas an hundred, and Ioavci* toAvards the sea tAvo hundred. By any value of the stadium this esti mate is doubtless too high, and the variety of accounts recorded by Strabo ,4* gives room for much uncertainty upon the subject ; the highest, he says, Avas an hundred stadia, the medium fifty, and the lowest seven. It is evident, therefore, that those Avho differed as much as seven from an hundred, either did not use the same stadium, or did not measure the river at the same time of the year : but it is remarkable, that if the loAvest number is considered as the Olympic I41 stadium I43, it corresponds nearly with Mr. Forster's account of the Indus above Attock, Avhere- he crossed it, and estimated it at three quarters of a mile English I44.

It would be Avell if Ave could reduce the lamer numbers of Arrian Avith as much facility ; but even Mr. d'Anville's stadium of fifty-one toises, Avhich gives someAvhat more than sixteen to a mile English, must here fail us ; for fifteen stadia Avould make the Akesines near a mile broad ; twenty would give a mile and quarter to the Hydaspes ; forty Avould supply two miles and a \u2022half to the Indus above the confluence ; an hundred produces six miles and a quarter for the breadth betAveen the confluence and Pattala ; and two hundred, tAvelve miles and an half for its final course. Shall Ave impute this enormity to the amplification of the Macedonians, or to the overfloAving of the river ? In sup- port of the latter, we have another extravagance of Onesicritus recorded by Strabo, Avho says, the Indus rises forty I45 feet, tAventy to its banks and tAventy above them ; but, unfortunately for this assertion, the fleet left Nicea in October, when the SAvellins* must have been on the decrease, and reached Pattala in July, before the next year's swelling could be very evident in the lower part of the river. According to Tieffenthaler and the Ayeen Akbari, the Indus between Moultan and Tatta runs in a stream comparatively narrow, but very deep, and Hamilton146 asserts, that the channel at Tatta is not more than a mile broad.

The most moderate breadth of the Hydaspes is found where Ave should least expect it, in Q.

Curtius. The more moderate language of Arrian will, at the same time it verifies a fact, give greater pleasure to the reader Avho prefers truth to embellishment.

It turned out, hoAvever, that the transports from their built, by yielding to the eddy, escaped with little injury, except the alarm ex cited in those on board ,* but the gallies, which from their length and sharpness Avere less adapted to encounter a danger of this sort, suffered greatly, and some, from having two banks of oars and the difficulty of managing those which were nearly on a level Avith the water, Avere exposed to the most imminent danger I63. \"**\u00bb Les vagues qui se formcnt en ce lieu la font paroitre line mer agitee.

If Ave had any data to fix the position of Xathra on the Indus, it Avould afford great satisfaction to prove the length of the line of transporta tion, but Xathra is named only by Arrian, and does not appear in Ptolemy, Strabo, Diodorus, or Q. Curtius. At the conflux of the Akesines Avith the Indus, Alexander fixed the establishment of a new city, of Avhich, though avc find no traces in modern accounts, we may naturally consider the situation as highly advantageous. A city fixed here would ne cessarily partake of all the commerce that passed up the Indus, to be distributed by means of the several sources above, from Candahar and Cabul on the west, to Tchamoo, and perhaps to Thibet, on the east ; and being the centre Avhere all these streams unite, must consequently derive equal emoluments from the commerce that passed dowmvards to the coast.

As Ave are now to leave the confluences of the respective rivers, which have hitherto served to direct us in the position of cities, tribes, and countries, a scene of difficulties opens which nothing but a desire of elucidating ancient geography Avould tempt me to explore at greater length than those Avho have trod the same ground before me. Our materials are scanty ; for Arrian and Diodorus have only tAvo short pages, Q. Curtius part of one chapter, and Strabo tAvo or three lines. In all of them there is hardly a characteristic feature to distinguish one place from another ; time and distances are equally disregarded by all. Added to this, I feel some repugnance in deserting the guidance of my constant director Major Rennell, by fixing the Sogdi ,8s at Behker, and Musikanus at SeAvee ; but I do this 185 Though I desert Major Rennell, I have the approbation of d'Anville.

Let us first take a vieAV of the country as it exists at present. The Indus rolls doAvn from the confluence of the Chen-ab or Akesines to Tatta, four hundred lB7 miles in one channel, Avith hardly a single point to characterise one part of its course from another, except the island Behker. Behker is the termination of the modern province of Moultan ; the general term for the tract beloAv is Scindy ; the title it bears in the enumeration of the Mogol provinces is the Soobah of Tatta ; but in the time of Akbar this Soobah Avas added to that of Moultan. The Soobah of Tatta is divided into five circars. I. Tatta, the Pattala of the ancients. II. Hajykan, running parallel to the Indus, and extending north above Behker. III. Sewistan, between Behker and Tatta. IV. Nusseerpoor, extending east from the head of the Delta ; and, V. Chucherhaleh, (as Avell as I can collect,) extending from the eastern mouths of the Indus along the coast towards the bay of Cutch. We have therefore two principal positions on the river, betAveen the confluence and the Pattaltme ; Behker in Moultan, and SeAvee in Tatta. We have likeAvise tAvo governments named in ancient history, that of the Sogdi and of Moosikanus l89. I shall consider l89 each more parti cularly hereafter ; but at present these circumstances Avill afford some reason to conjecture that these circars are natural divisions of the country, and that the reason of this distribution existed 186 I believe^not near, but next to. ,,s Oxykanus was not on the Indus. npoc auri; V \u00ab$\u00bb ir, TiarscCKinin tii\\ te tS Mao-i- \"\"> Throughout the history of Ferishta, as xavS Xsyvo-i, x\u00ab\u00bb w 2a\u00a3<*i\u00ab*a ZivSo\u00bbaXiay, xal eti -rnt given by C.

The nature of the river itself Avill suggest other reflections, Avhich Avill tend to throAV farther light on the subject. For the Indus, although it resembles the Nile ,9\u00b0 in forming the centre of a valley and watering a country Avhere no rain falls, differs in some points more essential. The map is croAvded Avith the names of ancient cities and modern villages on the banks ofthe Nile, Avhile the Indus Jias only two places of importance, Behker and Sewee, in a course of four hundred miles. The range of sand \"' hills on the east is the residence of the Ashambety '**, Avhile a chain of rocks on the Avest commences from the sea, and runs nortliAvard nearly parallel Avith the river till it joins those of Kandahar. All the ridges of Asia afford security to tribes of plunderers ; those in the neighbourhood of Kandahar are the seat ofthe AgliAvans, the conquerors of Persia and the desolators of India ; and this range from the sea pro duces the Belootches, a tribe no less ferocious than the Agh- Avans. This range has likeAvise several branches ; one more par ticularly that reaches the Indus near SeAvee, and another Avhich, I have reason to think, forms the boundary betAveen SeAvistan and Hajikan ; and if there Avere any guide to direct me Avhere to fix the limits of Hajikan I9S, I should make it the territory of *\u00bb\u00b0 Major Rennell, Postscript. -*\u00bb Ayeen Akbari, vol. ii. p. 145.

Oxycanus, from similarity of sound, but I can nearly demon strate that the loAver branch in SeAvistan Avas the territory of Oxvkanus and Sambus. From this account of the modern state of the river and the country, let us now return to the ancient historians ; the order of transactions, alloAving for the variation of the narrative, is the same in all. I. The Sogdi of Arrian are the Sabrac\u00e6 of Q. Curtius, the Sambest\u00e6 and Sodr\u00e6 of Diodorus. We need not insist on the diversity of names, for it matters little; but the transactions which occurred, the voluntary surrender of the place, and the establishment of docks and arsenals, are all similar and accordant ; and though Diodorus Avould make the Sambest\u00e6 and Sodr\u00e6 ,94 distinct tribes, his transactions are too clear to leave a doubt. II. The Moosikanus of Arrian is the same both in name and order as in Q. Curtius, Diodorus, and Strabo. III. TheOxyk&nus of Arrian ansAversto the Presti of Q. Curtius, the Portikanus of Diodorus and Strabo. IV. And finally, the Sambus of Arrian has the same appellation in Diodorus, and is the Sabus of Q. Curtius, the Sabutas of Strabo. A situation is now to be found for these four successively ; and if a reasonab-e degree of probability can be assigned for placing the three first, alloAvances must be made for the scantiness of materials, if it is impossible to arrive at demonstration. After vieAving this question in a variety of lights, I have per suaded myself that the Sogdi Avere at Behker, Moosikanus at SeAvee, Oxykanus on the Avest of SeAvee at the foot of the moun tains, and Sambus on that range ofc mountains called Lukhy Avhich extends from the great Avestern range, and approaches the Indus at Sewee.

At the confluence of the Akesines, Craterus Avith the ele phants and the greater part of the army Avas transported to the eastern side of the Indus, as the country on that side appeared more convenient for the march of an army ; and Alexander dropped doAvn Avith the fleet to Sogdi. The distance and the time employed are both omitted by Arrian ; but if Ave place the Sogdi ,9S at Behker, the distance appears from Major Rennell to be short of an hundred and fifty I96 miles. In the same order follow the Sabrac\u00e6 of Q. Curtius, and the Sambest\u00e6 of Dio dorus ; both describe this tribe as living under a republican '\" form of government, and defended by an army of sixty thou sand foot, six thousand horse, and five hundred chariots ; both specify the submission of this people without a battle, and Dio dorus adds, that the Massani \"8 and Sodr\u00e6 were borderers on the river, Avho submitted at the same time.

Nothing* can be more barren of names than the line of the Indus here in Major Rennell, or de la Rochette ; and the discordance of those two geographers, being no less than seventy miles, adds still to the confusion and obscurity. Another con sideration is, that Behker in the modern division of the pro vince is a circar of Moultan ; and where the Dooabeh 20\u00b0 circars end, that of Behker begins : it folloAvs, therefore, that Behker Avould necessarily be the first capital from the junction of the Akesines, and naturally the site of the Sogdi or Sabrac\u00e6, the first tribe Alexander reached after leaving that junction.

According to the modern division, the circar or Dooabeh of Behker contains twelve malils1\"1, or places for collecting the revenue, Avhich amounts to fifty-seven thousand five hundred and seventy-eight pounds sterling \"% and furnishes four thousand six hundred and ninety horse, and eleven thousand one hun dred foot. These circumstances are stated from the modern account, to sIicav how reasonably it will bear a comparison with the ancient, allowing for much exaggeration, and considering that India appears more populous in early times than since it has been desolated by invasions. It would have been a fortunate circumstance if any of the historians had mentioned an island here, or in any part of the Indus betAveen the junction of the Akesines and Tatta; but their silence is unanimous. It will appear, hoAvever, that Ave have something more than conjecture to direct us, for Otter names Bekier, Sekier, and Tekier, as three places dependant on Man sura lc3 ; in which, though he is mistaken (for Bekier is 201 The names of the twelve mahls arc the same in Tieffenthaler and the Ayeen Akbari.

This description has led Mr. d'Anville into a great error, for the whole is represented on his map. The error arises from his making Behker and Mansura two different places, which the Ayeen Akbari proves to be the same ; but d'Anville places Behker near four degrees higher up the stream, and this Man sura he places below Sihwan.

Tekier is situated either at the re-union of the river after its separation to form the island, or just below it ; and Sekier assumes a place at the point Avhere the river divides. It is in Sekier, written' Sunker and Suckhor, that I find the Sogdi of Arrian, the Sodr\u00e6 of Diodorus, the Sadrae\u00e6 of Q. Curtius ; and as Sunker and Alore are two out of the twelve mahls assigned to Behker by the, Ayeen Akbari, this division has given rise to the distinction of them by Diodorus into separate tribes. Some reserve is necessary in asserting that Alore and Tekier are the same, but it seems highly probable, because Tekier is not mentioned by the Ayeen Akbari ; con cerning Suckhor all testimonies are united. I conclude, there fore, that the Sogdi of Arrian comprehend the Avhole island and circar of Behker, and that the name is derived from the prin cipal place in the circar at which the fleet arrived. If this should not be deemed conclusive, I beg the reader to suspend his judgment till he receives additional reasons for fixing the seat of Musikanus ; for the position of either to r certainty will give the respective situation of the other; and I must like- Avise observe, that the erecting of docks on an island is a natural convenience, while there is nothing on the higher part of the river to direct this operation more to one point than another. miles in length, which does not differ much it expresses victory in Arabjc.

This design is perfectly consistent Avith Alexander's scheme of exploring these provinces by marches in various directions ; and it is probable that Craterus Avent no farther Avith this body than to mark out the line they were to pursue, and then returned to the main army. The reunion of these forces will be noticed in its proper place. From Sogdi then, the Behker MS of the Hindoos, the Mansura of the Mosols or Persians, Alexander hastened doAvn the Indus to reach the city of Moosikanus, before he should be prepared for resistance. I have already said, that Strabo is my authority for placing Moosikanus loAver doAvn the river than Major Rennell ; for Strabo says expressly, that his territory Avas near, or next to, the Pattalene ; and a revieAv of Arrian s account, short as it is, convinces me that, after the transactions Avhich took place here are considered, the immediate arrival ofthe fleet at Pattala confirms the assertion of Strabo 304 It is worthy of remark that the Nubian Geographer makes Mansura a centre of com munication both east and west, p. 57, et seq. ; and such it would naturally be in all ages, unless the city Alexander built at the main junction of the rivers had taken root. 20S This island of Behker has two depend ant places, Tekier and Sekier, so written by Otter, vol. i. 409. Frazer writes Buckar for Behker, Sunkar for Sekier. Treaty Nadir To speak properly, we may consider Behker as equivalent to the capital Mansura, and the island ; Suckor or Sunkar as a town in the island. The Nulla Sunkar or Sunkra is the most eastern arm of the Indus, and assumed in the treaty of Nadir with Mahomed Shaw as the boundary of their dominions. In this sense Nulla Sunkra is the channel that leads to Sun kar : it is the same as Bundar Lori or Loheri, which leads to Loheri, a town in the same district.

I fix upon SeAvee for the residence of Moosikanus, because it is the head of the first circar of Tatta towards the north ; and conceiving, as I do, that all these circars have their division or boundaries from nature, I am persuaded that the surest ground for fixing any ancient name is to consider the present distribu tion of the provinces206. Sewistan, the name of this circar, comprehends the country on both sides the river ; but on the east there is probably little cultivation, as the tract tends to- Avard the desert and the sand hills 107. On the Avest, there are branches from the mountains extending towards the river in habited by Belootches, and on one of these branches, or at the foot of it, may be placed the territory of Oxykanus, the Porti\"* kanus of Strabo and Diodorus. The termination of these three names suggests an idea that they contain some allusion to the country, or some mutual relation or connection. What Avill be alleged on this subject I give merely as a conjecture, and I refer it to the Orientalists for further illustration ; but I cannot help thinking that I discover the name of the circar in every .one of them. SeAvee is Avritten Sevi, Sihouan, SiliAvan, and SeliAvan. It is not easy to establish the identity of these names to the same 306 Behker is considered as centrical between Tatta and Moultan, and Sewee as centrical between Tatta and Behker, in the paper I re ceived from Mr. H. Jones. Al Biruni is quoted by M. de la Rochette as a native geo grapher from Birun, near the Pattalene, who might throw great light upon these provinces, if I had known where to find his work, or means to understand it. Sewistan, in every account that I have seen, is a circar highly commercial ; and even in the present state of the country, pre-eminent. l\u00b0l Tieffenthaler, vol. i. p. 122^"], [197, "COURSE OF THE FLEET DOWN THE INDUS. 147 place ; for though our maps make them the same, the Ayeen Akbari108 mentions a chain of mountains extending from Seh- Avan to Seewee, regarding them as different places though in the same circar ; and an obscure San 10g marked on the maps is possibly a corruption of Sehwan. Be this as it. may, Sihwan is an appellation sufficiently known and acknowledged ; and this Avord, I think, may be discovered in Moo-sihan-us, Ok-sihan us, Por-sihan-us \"\u00b0, for the aspirate h passes into k in almost all Avords derived from Oriental lano*uao*es 2\". The termination is Greek for sake of inflexion only, and the initial syllable Avill possibly be found in the Sanskreet to convey an idea of the relation in Avhich they stand. This may be conjecture, and conjecture founded on etymology finds but little countenance at present. Neither do I Avish to invalidate the assumption of Major Rennell, Avho supposes Oxycanus to be Hajykan. My chief reason for not coinciding in this opinion is, that Hajykan is higher to the north than Avould accord with the course of the transactions ; but the circar may have been more extensive formerly, or may derive its name from a source which it is noAv impossible to trace. HoAvever this may be, I am convinced from much study of my author's, that the Indian names which occur in them are generalty capable of being traced to native appellations existing at this day among the 3,8 Vol. ii. p. 142.

I have proved this in regard to the names of the Panje-ab rivers ; others have long seen it in the Malli, Oxy'drac\u00e6, Peu kaliotis, Gurei ; and I am convinced that every name men tioned in the historians of Alexander Avill be found either in the history or memory of the Hindoos. I conceive that they exist in the Sanskreet at this hour, though they may be knoAvn to Europeans in a different form, derived from the Mogols, dis figured by the lapse of time, change of -language, or variety of Avriting. I have the opinion of Major Rennell in confirmation of this idea, and his judgment I esteem decisive. If Ave would noAv folloAv Alexander in his descent from the Sogdi to the territory of Moosikanus, Ave must apply to modern sources for information. Arrian gives neither time or distance, and mentions nothing of the country through Avhich the Indus rolls ; but the maps give us upAvards of eighty \"2 miles \"3 from Behker to SeeAvee, and the Ayeen Akbari \"4 informs us, that the country is a desert subject in summer to the Semoom, or suf focating wind. The term desert, hoAvever, must be qualified ; for we are informed that the Indus changes its course, inclining some years to the east 2IS, and others to the Avest ; and that it is not so absolutely desert, but that there are villages \"6 of herds men who change their habitation with the stream.

English traveller Avho verified the fact upon the spot, we ob tain a local characteristic dependent upon the constant opera tion of nature, Avhich fiction could not invent, and scepticism cannot doubt. Moosikanus had sent no offers of submission to Alexander^ but surprised by his sudden approach, and not prepared for defence, he advanced to meet the monarch upon his arrival, and surrendered his city, territory, and elephants, at discretion. The readiness of his submission, and the acknoA\\dedgment of his offence, procured him a ready pardon ; for upon all occa sions of this nature, the policy and generosity of the conqueror Avere in unison. He found the territory one of the richest 2IS in this part of India, and the city so commodiously situated, that he determined to erect a citadel here, and leave a sufficient gar rison for its support. Even in the comparative Avealth of this place I find reason to think Moosikanus must be fixed at SeeAvee rather than Behker, for the comparative Avealth of the tAvo cities continues still the same. According to the Ayeen Akbari, the revenue of Behker is only tAvo hundred and thirty-tAvo pounds 2,% Avhile that of Seewee 22\u00b0 is five thousand two hundred and eighteen.

My conjecture is directed by the mention of Sambus next, as a satrap appointed by Alexander himself over the Indians of the mountains ; for the mountains mentioned here correspond exactly with the range called Lukhy222 in the Ayeen Akbari. They are a branch of that great chain which extends from the sea to Kandahar, one shoot of which reaches nearly to the Indus at Seewee, and affords a residence for a horde of Belootches 2\" called Kulmany. On these mountains I have no hesitation to place Sambus ; and if in the little light avc have to direct us Ave obtain one position, there is no reasonable objection to fixing the other in correspondence to it. By the motion of the army immediately out of the territory of Oxy kanus into that of Sambus on the mountains, it should appear that Oxykanus Avas on the plain at the foot of that range ; and I contend that this plain and these mountains must be on the west of the Indus, because the desert and the sandy hills are on the east ; and there is no authority, either ancient or modern, to shew that the range on the east ever approaches the river at any one point. 221 No/*\u00abpj-;iv P.s Tairrri yfe, chief of a district for the chief of a mahl, in reference to a circar. in the country here, literally.

Alexander marched against Oxykanus because he had received no embassy or acknowledgment from him ; he took tAvo of his largest cities by assault, and in one of them Oxykanus himself ; the plunder Avas abandoned to the soldiers, and the elephants only reserved for the public service. Several other cities surrendered without resistance; for by this time, says Arrian, the spirit of all the Indians Avas completely 224 subdued. Q. Curtius relates these circumstances AArith some shade of difference ; Oxykanus, he says, Avas killed, and the people he calls Presti. I desire to make but one more observation. Oxykanus Avas not on the river ; for if he had been, Alexander need not have landed to* march against him ; he was near Sambus, and Sambus was satrap of the mountains. The conclusion is, therefore, that he was on the Avest of the Indus, and highly probable that his ter ritory Avas at the foot of that range called Lukhy, consequently that Moosikanus and Oxykanus were both chiefs in the circar of SeliAvan. Sambus, the next object of Alexander's pursuit, has a variety of names, Avhich prove only the doubts of historians, and ob scurity of the transactions ; for this chief is the Sabutas 22s of Strabo, the Sabbas of Plutarch, the Ambigarus of Justin, the Ambiras of Orosius, the Sabus or Samus of Q. Curtius. This recital is preserved in order to excite the attention of the Orientalists ; for the idea of locality is probably attached to one or other of these appellations, if the true etymology can be obtained. 325 See Snakenbrock's Notes on Q^Curtius, lib. is. c. 8.

He had made his submission to Alexander, and received from him a fresh appointment to his satrapy \"s ; but upon receiving intelligence that Moosikanus had made his peace Avith the conqueror, he had abandoned his country and fled. For this flight no reason is assigned ; but it is natural to suppose, that in the reconcilia tion of his enemy A\\\"k4i Alexander he foresaAV sufficient reason \"7 to distrust both ;. and as conquerors alloAV none of their tri butaries to be injured by any but themselves, Sambus might reasonably imagine, that either his future incursions Avould be prohibited, or his former ravages must be accounted for; in either case it Avas his interest to retire ; and if he had submitted to Alexander before the reduction of Moosikanus, it is probable that a participation in the plunder of that prince's province had been a principal inducement to effect his submission. When or Avhere this transaction took place does not appear, but if we place it at Sogdi, the delay of Moosikanus in making applica tion for terms, is a sufficient motive for the conduct of his rival. Invasion 22! is too often fortunate in finding the jealousy 3:6 -\\fcre ought to consider Sambus as a na tive chief.

In the Sindimana233 of Arrian, the capital of Sambus, I find an allusion to Scindi, the most general and common name of the country on both sides the Indus 234 ; and though there are strong objections to placing any city of importance sufficient to 232 The whole account in Q^_ Curtius is con* fused as usual.

I speak with great diffidence upon the identical situation of Moosikanus, Oxykanus, and Sambus ; but I have no doubt about the settlement of them all in Seewistan and the mountains adjacent ; and I maintain that Musikanus cannot be at Behker, as there is neither mountain or hill that approaches the river near that island. If M. de la Rochette's 2s6 Map can be depended upon in regard to this circar, his disposition of Lukhy or Lacki exactly corresponds Avith the topography I Avish to adopt. Sindimana made no resistance, for though Sambus had fled, he had no hostile designs against Alexander. He Avas probably alarmed for his personal safety on account of the submission of Musikanus ; but the gates of the city Avere open, and the officers of the fugitive chief delivered up his treasures and elephants Avithout hesitation. From hence the army advanced to another fortress called the City of the Bramins, and as Diodorus men tions his Harmatelia Avith the same attribute, it is doubtless the same. This city is said to have revolted, by which Ave may understand that it had been included in the original submission of Sambus, and upon his flight prepared to defend itself. It Avas taken Avithout difficulty, and the Bramins, Avho Avere the ad visers of resistance, Avere put to the sAvord. While these trans actions were going on, intelligence Avas brought that Musikanus had revolted. Python, noAv satrap of the province, was or dered to proceed against him, while Alexander seized the cities \"M A tribe called Tehery is placed at the 33f See his Sheet Map of India, published foot of this territory, in the Ayeen Akbari, by Faden. vol. ii. 1 1 J.

These, Ave may conclude, lay between the country of Sambus and the river, and lower doAvn than the residence of Moosikanus ; but whether Alexander \u25a0* returned thither, or joined the fleet beloAv, does not evidently appear ; he found Moosikanus, hoAvever, a prisoner in the hands of Py thon, and executed him with the Bramins, who were the pro moters of his revolt. While Alexander was preparing for the prosecution of his voyage, he dispatched Craterus, at the head of two divisions of the phalanx and a body of archers, Avith orders to take up on his march such of the companions and other Macedonians who had before been ordered to proceed through Arachosia and Drangiana. The Avhole of these forces, with the elephants, were to direct their course by an inland route to Karmania, and join the main army again in that province. Tire primary ob ject of this route appears evidently to be in correspondence Avith the plan Alexander had laid doAvn for surveying and exploring the extensive provinces of his empire ; and a secondary design suggests itself, Avhich is, that he Avas already acquainted Avith the sterility of Cadrosia, Avhich he intended to encounter him self, and therefore lessened the hazard of distress in proportion to the diminution of his numbers.

The testimony of Strabo 24t is positive, that the territory of Musikanus joins the Pattalene : it is upon this testimony that I first found reason to dissent from Major Rennell, and upon which I build the whole explication, detailed perhaps too much at length for the ordi nary patience of readers, but of great consequence to historians aud geographers, and highly conducive to the elucidation of our classical authorities. I must noAv observe that Major Ren nell's map gives an hundred and forty miles, and de la Rochette's an hundred and fifty, by the scale, in a right line from SiliAvan to Tatta. This, Avith the sinuosity of the river, may be estimated at tAvo hundred miles ; and if Ave should noAv add eighty 242 or ninety miles more to carry back Moosikanus to Behker, I ask Avhat reference can Arrian's three days' voyage have to such a distance? \u2014 but there are more than three days; \u2014 for he pro ceeded three days, and after that hurried doAvn to Pattala.

All these circumstances considered, there is every reason to conclude that Arrian is in harmony Avith Strabo ; and as both these authors 241 Lib. xv. p. 701. rifos aVTri P, Tloma \\wr,, ad ipsam Pattalenam. 242 One hundred or one hundred and twenty, allowing for the course of the river."], [209, "COURSE OF THE FLEET DOWN THE INDUS. 159 drew from original sources, Avhenever they agree, little atten tion is due to Diodorus, Q. Curtius, or Plutarch. Upon this occasion, hoAvever, though there is some confusion, there is nothing in any one of those writers contradictory to the deduc tion here made. It may be objected, that by placing two chiefs in this pro vince, and a third on the mountains near it, we comprehend too much in proportion to the space allotted ; but by the re venue Akbar derived from this soobah in general*, and from the circar of SeeAvistan only, there is reason to suppose, that as long as there Avas any commerce upon the Indus all these circars Avere rich, and all the parts of them cultivated which Avere capable of cultivation. There, is still greater reason to believe, that in the early ages they Avere all more populous and more opulent ; for a number of small states, such as appear every where during this irruption of the Macedonians, universally in dicate 243 population, commerce, and Avealth.

Bus a Aveightier charge may be alleged against me, for setting up my opinion in opposition to Major Rennell. No one can bear ampler testimony to the accuracy of that able geographer than myself, for no one has studied his map and his memoirs Avith more attention ; and if I dissent from him in this one instance, I do it Avith that deference which is due to his abilities, and the superior opportunities he has had of obtaining information. Before we proceed to Pattala, I must mention a few circum stances communicated to me by favour of Mr. H. Jones, from a gentleman who had been resident for the East India Company at Tatta. 1. That the influence ofthe Abdallee government, in 1794, extended over the Delta or Pattala of the ancients ; that the Sirdar Futti Ali had kept his residence at Tatta, and main tained himself there for twenty years, but Avas daily in expecta tion of being overpoAvered by Salem Shah, sovereign of the Abdallees or Durannis. 2. That Behker, which lies betAveen Moultan and Sewistan, is now in ruins. 3. That Sewistan, half Avay betAveen Behker and Tatta, is separated from Behker by a jungle or forest ; it is still productive of excellent horses for cavalry, horned cattle, grain of all sorts, cotton, indigo, sugar, saltpetre, assafetida. 4.

That the navigation of the Indus is noAv abandoned by the Cabul and Persian merchants, from the unsettled state of the country. Lastly, This account, which comes doAvn as Ioav as 1794, furnishes many particulars in correspondence Avith the detail we have been engaged in, and nothing to contradict the historians of Alexander. The inva sion of another conqueror, Avho could reduce the whole under any form of regular government, and open the communications again, Avould be a benefit to the country, instead of an injury or oppression ; and if the Abdallees should in this instance tread in the steps of the Macedonians, one general despot Avho should govern the Avhole, and for his oavii interest protect it, Avould be better than a variety of petty tyrants Avho desolate each other's territory, Avithout obtaining security for their own ; or the predatory incursions of the barbarous tribes, avIio not only rob, but annihilate the industry of the merchant and the cultivator.

The Pattalene is a Delta, like the LoAver Egypt, but the di mensions of it seem very ill defined. The base of this triangle lies nearly north-east and south-Avest ; and if it Avere possible to give the extent of it exactly, Ave should obtain a great desidera tum in geography.

The longitude of Sagapa, (the extreme west- ern mouth,) according to Ptolemy, was II0\u00b0 20'. In these numbers the Greek text and Latin translation agree ; but the longitude of Lonibari (the extreme eastern mouth) is very doubtful. The Greek text gives no\u00b0 20', pi u, but these numbers are unquestionably cor- rupt, which appears by comparing them with the longitudes of the intermediate mouths. The emendation which naturally occurs is for p. j_ to read pi/x, i. e. for 1 io\u00b0 20', 1 130 ; and according to this conjectured emendation, the difference of longitude of the extreme mouths should be no more than 2\u00b0 40' ; but the Latin interpreter gives the longitude of Lonibari 11 30 30', a3 if the reading of his Greek text had been piy-n : thus the difference of longitude is doubtful. But whichever estimation of the difference of longitude we adopt, whether 2\u00b0 40' or 3\u00b0 10', the distance to be deduced from the assumed difference of longitude is to be computed according to the length of a degree upon the parallel of 240 of latitude.

The measurement of the sides is as difficult to obtain as that of the base of this triangle ; nor does any thing appear like authority on this head, except Avhat is found in Major Rennell, that it is an hundred and tAventy-five miles by the course of the river from Laribundar to Tatta, and Laribundar is from fifteen to eighteen miles distant from the sea; this, with four miles from Tatta to the head of the Delta, makes upwards of an hundred and forty-four miles for the Avestern branch of the LoAver Delta, and is reduced to sixty-eight geographical miles by the scale *59. The eastern branch by the course of the river is stated in the same author at an hundred and seventy miles. This is the best information attainable on the subject ; for, as the authority of other maps is unknown, they are less to be depended on. But there is another extraordinary source of obscurity Avhich belongs to no other spot upon earth ; for as the English charts give Lari-bundar for the extreme point Avest, and by a peculiar inversion Bundar-Lari for the extreme point east, so does the Ayeen Akbari give Cutch for the country eastward, on the bay of Cutch 26\u00b0 or Scindy, and another Cutch *\" for Mekran on the west.

May not this suggest an idea that Sangada Avas anciently applicable to both sides of the river, as Cutch is at present ; and that the name has survived on the east, Avhile it has perished on the west ? In regard to the name of Cutch, Major Rennell is pro bably not mistaken, when he conjectures that Cedge26* or Gedge may be the native root of Cedrosia, the Cutch or Gedge-Mekran of the moderns. It has been already observed, that Alexander had conceived a plan of that commerce Avhich was afterwards carried on from Alexandria to the Indian ocean. I think this capable of de monstration by his conduct after his arrival at Pattala, and I shall enumerate some circumstances in confirmation of this assumption. Alexander, in his passage down the Indus, had evidently marked it as the eastern frontier of his empire. He had built three cities, and fortified two others on this line ; and he Avas noAv preparing for the establishment of Pattala at the head of the Delta, and planning two other posts at the eastern and Avestern mouths of the river.

His next care Avas to explore the deserts on both l63 sides, to find water and to sink wells. This is one evidence rather of a commercial than mili tary tendency, for such, all who have travelled in the deserts will esteem it, and such was the opinion of Arrian, avIio adds, that it Avas with a view to render the country habitable. The construction of a fortress at Pattala was committed to Hephestion ; and as soon as that business Avas in some degree of forwardness, Alexander prepared to explore the Avestern branch of the river to its mouth. The general course of this navigation is no difficult matter to conceive ; but the particulars afford doubts, which*, from the deficiency of materials, and the variations in those Ave have, are not easy to be resolved. If Ave place Pattala near the head of the Delta, Avhich Ave must, the site of Braminabad now in ruins, Avithin four miles of Tatta, Avill sufficiently correspond. This city, before the inroads of the Mahometans and Mogols, is said to have been surrounded Avith a Avail that, had fourteen hundred bastions ; and the wealth and importance of such a capital, Avhile commerce flourished on the Indus, plainly indicate164 the judgment of Alexander in choosing it as a position for a fortress. If his departure Avas from this point, his progress Avas doAvn the Lari-bundar river, or DarraAvay ; and the mention of tAvo islands, one near the mouth and the other out at sea, will afford reason to suppose that the first is that upon Avhich Lari-bundar 265 stands in our 26J More probably on the west only. *> Major Rennell's last map places Lari- 26*\u00bb It indicates, likewise, the population of bundar on the west of the Darraway, or rather ancient India, as superior to the modern ; a Pitty branch. point so often insisted on in this work."], [219, "COURSE OF THE FLEET DOWN THE INDUS. 169 best charts. This, hoAvever, is not clear ; for Captain Hamil ton, who describes Lari-bundar as a village 2SS of an hundred houses with a fort, and who himself conducted 2S7 a caravan from hence to Tatta, does not inform us on Avhich side-the river it. is placed. From the course of his march Ave should suppose it to be on the Avestern side, as Rennell \"8 has described it ; other wise he must have crossed the river, Avhich is not noticed. There is, however, one circumstance to make us think his route lay within the Delta, for he mentions the tombs *6' of the an cient kings evidently at Braminabad, four miles from Tatta, as if they lay in his road ; if so, Lari-bundar is not on the Avest of the Indus. Mr. Dalrymple *7\u00b0 is satisfied in regard to the position of Lari bundar on the eastern bank, but thinks its insular situation dubious ; neither would it have been necessary to insist on this point, unless from a desire of fixing one of those islands ob served by Alexander in his passage to the sea.

When these difficulties Avere surmounted, the fleet proceeded ; and as it uoav approached the sea, the stream appeared enlarged to tAvo hundred stadia ~1t ; an exaggeration which no computation of the stadium, no allowance for the overfloAving of the river, can justify. It is true that the season 27s might have swelled the Avaters nearly to the highest, and the monsoon contributed to the obstruction of their discharge; but that a river, which is not more than a mile or a mile and a half broad, should from either of these causes be spread to the extent of tAvelve or thir teen miles 276, is not consistent Avith probability. The numbers in Arrian are possibly erroneous, (for all numbers in a Greek text are to be suspected) ; but if they are correct, and copied from the journals Arrian folloAved, Ave must either make great alloAvance for the different *77 breadth of the river in that age, or suppose (as is much more probable) that the Mace- 272 As this was nearly the month of August, the south-west monsoon was in its full vigour. 275 July or August. 276 By the lowest stadium. 277 The Indus, like all the other streams subject to the solstitial swell, accumulates ob structions at its mouth.

That day produced a violent gale from the sea, and great hazard to the fleet, Avhich had evidently moved Avith the tide of ebb, and been involved in the turbulence raised by the opposi tion ofthe Avind to the stream. To avoid this, they took shelter, by the advice of their native pilots, in one of the canals273 or creeks Avhich had been formed for the convenience of the neighbouring country.

The distance of this second island from Killoota is estimated at two hundred stadia, or about tAvelve miles ; and if our modern maps or charts Avere to be depended on, Ave could find positions for both these islands.

Hephestion Avas left to superintend the construction of a naval arsenal here, Avith orders to fortify it, and prepare it for the reception of a fleet Avhich Avas to be established at this station, Avhi'e Alexander himself should undertake another excursion to the sea by the eastern branch of the river. These tAvo branches only are mentioned by Arrian, and the reason evidently is, that these were the only two explored by the Macedonians. I have met Avith no author prior to Ptolemy avIio mentions the seven 286 mouths ; and modern geography, though it preserves the record of the river still having seven issues, affords nothing specific upon the subject. On two of Mr. Dairy in pie's charts, double the number of creeks or inlets may be collected, Avith their names ; but Avhether they are natural or artificial, ancient or modern, seems, from all the in formation Ave have at present, impossible to determine. Major Rennell brings out the eastern channel much farther towards the east in his second map than in his first ; the channel itself, or the place at which it issues, is named Pandrimmee or Pandrammee, in his and several of Mr. Dalrymple's charts ; and the stream is called Nulla Sunkra.

It is not a little re markable, that previous to this treaty in 1739 the boundary of Indostan and Persia Avas nearly the same as in the age of Alexander; for till this took place, the Mogul empire extended to the range of mountains on the west of the Indus, the resi dence of the Belootches, and in Arrian's journal the river Arbis or Arabis, which springs from that chain and runs parallel with it at no great distance, Avas the limit of India and of Indian manners 289. Nadir Shah had passed the sources of the Indus and the Panje-ab, and he preferred the Attock river as a boundary to any other ; he prescribed this, therefore, to the conquered Ma hommed, and at the same time carried his claim to the circar of Tatta and its dependencies, including the Avhole Delta, as bounded by the easternmost branch, or Nala Sunkra, and establishing290 Lohry-Bundar (evidently beyond that line) as the extent of the Mogul empire. There is nothing but the term Nala Avhich hinders me from establishing this as the very channel navigated by Alexander ; and though no modern accounts have ever been attainable to p. 409, perhaps for Leuheri. Lohry, for so it is written in the treaty, may be referred to what our English authorities call Bundar Laree, to distinguish it from Lari-bundar on the western branch, or Daraway.

If the present Nala be a genuine stream, there is no difficulty in adopting it ; if it is an old channel cleansed, it might assume the name of Nala ; and if it is a new cut, it cannot be of very late date; for the commerce on the Indus is ruined. In any vieAV, it must be nearly parallel with the ancient channel, and at least part of the course pur sued bv the Macedonians. Alexander himself assumed the office of exploring this passage ; and no commander Avas ever more personally entitled to the honour accruing from the success of his designs, or contributed more by his OAvn exertions to the accomplishment of them : In battle he constantly fought at the head of that body on which the fortune of the day depended ; in all expeditions 291 he personally executed that part which pre sented the greatest difficulties ; and in every scheme of magni tude, after procuring the best information, he Avas the first to try the ground himself, before he committed 292 the execution of it to others. It Avas in conformity to these principles of conduct that he now determined to explore the eastern branch of the Indus ; conquest Avas at an end, for the barrier of the empire Avas de termined on ; and evidently no object Avas before him, but either the safety of the fleet in the choice of a passage, or that still greater system of commerce Avhich he had meditated, to f Fie sent Craterus through the midland 29J He visited the stagnant pools from the provinces, and marched himself through Ga- inundation of the Tigris and Euphrates, and drosia. planned the barrier at Pallacopas."], [227, "COURSE OF THE FLEET DOWN THE INDUS. 177 connect the interests of Europe and India, and of which the success of Nearchus Avas to be the origin and commence- ment. He departed from Pattala apparently with the same escort as before, and fell doAvn the stream till he arrived ata lake or bay, which was of great extent, and received its supplies from other waters in the adjacent tract. But as Ave know the Indus re ceives no tributary streams after it passes Behker, Ave must conclude that these waters in the neighbourhood can be no other than different channels, which branch from the main river and intersect the Delta in different directions ; thus is Arrian, Avho mentions but tAvo channels, compelled to bear Avitness to the existence of more. And Avould not this be the case Avith the Macedonians themselves ? They navigated only two streams, and therefore described but tAvo ; they have nevertheless re corded the circumstances which occurred, and these circum stances prove more to us than to those concerned in the trans action. This lake '\" is evidently no more than a bay into Avhich the eastern channel falls, and must be searched for in vain at the distance of tAventy centuries, considering the nature of the river, and the accumulations at its mouth.

He observed the passage here more open and convenient than that through the Avestern branch ; and though he did not aftenvards send the fleet doAvn this channel, Ave may collect that he intended to use it as the means of com munication Avith the coast of Guzerat and Malabar, by the transactions which took place ; for as soon as he had anchored he landed with a body of horse, and proceeded three 294 days march along the coast, making observations on the country, and directing Avells to be sunk. The general title of this tract is Cutch I9S, and gives name to a bay on Avhich it lies ; the country is a desert inland, and seldom passed but by the caravans A\\rhich used to travel betAveen Guzerat and the Indus 2,s. Our modern journals still mark the AArells Avhich have been sunk to make the desert passable. Parallel to the coast runs a range of mountains called Chigoo ; and the strip of land betAveen these and the sea is the residence of the Sanganians 297, a race infamous for their piracies in the accounts of all our early voyagers. Along this level Alexander a Vanced, and the Avells he sunk sufficiently indicate the object of his expedition. If I understand Arrian right, Mr. Rennell 2?8 is mistaken Avhen he supposes Alexander to have advanced Avestward along the Delta upon his landing in the direction that his fleet was to sail, for the fleet did not put to sea by this channel ; and mention is afterwards made of a detachment that appears to have landed 2S** Probably fifty or sixty miles. 255 Kartsch.

Upon the conclusion of this excursion, Alexander embarked his horse again, and returned to the head of the bay Avhere he had left Leonnatus. Here he directed a station 3\u00a3>I to be fixed, Avith a naval yard and dock, leaving a sufficient garrison for its protection, and provision for four months. I enter into this detail of minute facts, in order to evince the reality of that -foresight and prudence which I have all along attributed to this great commander ; his character has been usually estimated by the victories he gained and the ravages he spread ; but the regulation of his empire, the security of his frontier, the extent of his commercial views, the survey of his provinces, and the share he took himself in every thing that concerned his government, lie obscured by the splendour of his arms and the extent of his conquests. We are now to attend him back again to Pattala ; and if I could give a satisfactory account of this eastern branch, I should gratify the curiosity of the most accurate inquirer : but Major Rennell, avIio says it is an hundred and seventy miles in extent, does not carry the Nulla Sunkra to Tatta, but much higher.

Alexander did not stay long at Pattala after his return ; he had previously determined to penetrate into Gadrosia, and ex plore the coast, in order to facilitate the success of Nearchus ; and from the circumstances which occurred, avc may collect that he moved near a month earlier than the fleet. Strabo mentions that he was ten months in his passage from Nicea to Pattala ; if, therefore, he had set out on the twenty-third of October in the year three hundred and twenty-seven A. C., he came to Pattala in August three hundred and tAventy-six ; but the dates in the same author prove rather nine months than ten ; and the concurrent testimony of other facts favours this estimate rather than the other.

I place the departure of the' army from Pattala in the latter end of August, or the beginning of September, at which time Nearchus received his final orders, which directed him to take charge of the fleet, to prepare every thing necessary for the voyage, and to proceed to sea as soon as the season would permit. Alexander proceeded into the country of the Arabit\u00e6, lying evidently in that range of mountains before described, which commences from the sea and extends parallel Avith the Indus up to Kandahar. These mountains are still occupied by different tribes of the Belootches, Avhose habits to this day resemble the manners of the people described by the Macedonians. They dispersed at the approach of a superior force, and col lected again from their fastnesses as soon as the enemy Avas passed. These Arabit\u00e6 are mentioned by Arrian as an independent tribe, like the Belootches 3\u00b04 of the present day ; as in fact all the inhabitants of mountains305 either in Persia or Hindostan have generally been.

Major Rennell's second map defines this country aud the ridge Avhich ends at Cape Monze, agreeably to Arrian's account, and, from a variety of corresponding circumstances, there is every reason to subscribe to his opinion. And here, as I shall have no better opportunity to mention a variety of facts, Avhich Avill contribute to the perspicuity of the narrative, I shall introduce a general vieAV of the coast, and the peculiarities connected with it. The nature of the tAvo coasts of Malabar and Coromandel is noAv Avell known in Europe, as consisting of a tract of Ioav land tOAvards the sea, beloAv a line of mountains Avhich enclose the Avhole centre of the peninsula ; the same circumstance seems to take place again on the bay of Cutch, where the Chigoo mountains appear running inland, parallel with the sea, till they join the range of sand hills which form the eastern branch of the valley in which the Indus Aoavs ; the centre of this valley is occupied by the stream, and at no great distance on the western side, another barrier is raised by the chain of black and rocky mountains so often mentioned ; one ridge of which terminates not far from the Avestern mouth of the Indus at Cape Monze, the Eirus of the Macedonians. Out of this chain, at no great distance from the sea, a branch shoots off again, running west or north-Avest parallel with the coast306, and inclosing the level country of Gadrosia, parched 306 It is nearly evident that a second ridge of the Oritse. shoots from this chain, forming the residence Q^Curtius says, that Alexander waited at"], [233, "COURSE OF THE FLEET DOWN THE INDUS. 183 and barren in the extreme. The modern name of this tract is Mekran, or Cutch 3\u00b07 Mekran, and is specified in Commodore Robinson's journal, published by Lieutenant Porter by the name of Bloachee, and Brodia. , Bloachee is a corruption of Belot chee, and I imagine the coast is so called as far as the influence of the Belootches 3\u00b08 extends, and, Avhere that ends, Brodia. That this branch sends off shoots toAvards the sea at particular points seems probable ; but that its general course is parallel with the coast, is ascertained by Commodore Robinson's 309 jour nal, and another ofthe Houghton East Indiaman, 1755, Avhich I oAve to the communication of Mr. Dalrymple.

This range, Mr. d'Amille says, is never cut by any river, but stretches on uninterrupted till it joins the mountains Avhich encircle Persis and Susiarta. Here the Tigris stops its farther progress, and sends it off Avith Ararious curva tures till it joins the mountains of Armenia. These general properties attending the Avhole range of coast almost from the mouths of the Ganges to the Tigris, present one of the boldest features in the geography of the Avorld, and become of more importance, as these mountains connect Avith that extraordinary chain which extends on the north of Persia across the sources of the Indus, forms the barrier of Hindostan, and penetrates through the extremity of Asia, till it falls into the sea of Amoor, on the north of China. There is no part of Arrian's history where these general cir cumstances connect Avith the transactions of the Macedonians, Avhich is umvorthy of the attention of geographers ; and, on the particular coast of Avhich Ave are iioav to treat, nothing which the most accurate investigation of modern inquirers has not confirmed.

He advanced with a body of horse and light troops, leaving the remainder to follow under the command of Hephestion ; the natives fled into the desert on his approach ; in pursuit of them he passed the A'rabis314, a narrow stream Avith little Avater, and advancing through the desert all night, reached the habitable country in the morning.

Moran, I have no doubt, is the Ma lana of Arrian, which he says is the western limit of the Orit\u00e6 ; and a bluff head-land, mentioned here by Lieutenant Porter, is, I apprehend, the termination of the ridge.

The reason for proceeding before the monsoon commenced, is ascribed by Strabo to the discontent of the natives ; and Ave may observe, that though Meris, the chief of Pattala, had previously made his submission to Alexander, he fled on the approach of the fleet, and no mention is afterwards made of his return, or his being brought in by the troops who Avere sent in pursuit of him.

This transaction throAvs light upon the narrative of Arrian, and reconciles the difficulty arising from the departure of the expedition before the season.

But there is one particular relating to the de parture, Avhich, if Arrian intentionally suppressed the flight of the Macedonians, seems to indicate the reality of it ; for it ap pears, according to his own account, that the fleet did not take its departure from Pattala, but from a station near the mouth of the river. This station is doubtless the post Alexander had formed, and probably at Killoota1; for there, our author says, he had found Avater and good anchorage, with protection both from the tides and the monsoon. If I had sufficient data for fixing the Debil-Scindy of our modern maps near the mouth of the Laribundar river, I should have little hesitation in asserting its identity Avith Killoota, for Debil-Scindy is only a Persian or nautical corruption of Dev, or 3 Dive-il-Scindi, the island of the Scind, or Scindi. The Dabil of Al Edrissi is placed three stations, that is, sixty or seventy miles, from the mouth of the river ; but Diul is de scribed by Purchas4 as the residence of the governor, at about ten miles distance only from the Bar. If this were on the eastern side of the river, and insulated by a stream derived from the main channel, it would correspond sufficiently with the Killoota of Arrian, both in point of distance and position ; and 3 Dive is common to many Indian dialects. lower down, according to the change of go vernment, or the convenience of the gover nor.

But if Nearchus took his departure from a station 6 at this island, and not from Pattala, (as Avill immediately appear,) though it does not amount to proof that he was driven from thence by the natives, it affords great reason to suspect it, and to confirm the assertion of Strabo, avIio copied from the journal of Nearchus as Avell as Arrian.

But if the distance from the bar to Crotchey is established, the course from the point of departure to the bar must be of necessity alloAved ; both are given at an hundred and fifty stadia by Arrian, and if one is true, the other can hardly be erroneous.

This island can hardly answer to the wo; a^uin; of Arrian. (Lieutenant Porter. C. Robinson, p. 1.) Forbytheplan it appears high ; and I conclude the low island mentioned by Arrian to be that sand in the heart of the bay, dry at low water. Probably the first isle mentioned at C. Eirus by Arrian, and marked as a shoal by Dalrymple, is like wise dry at low water, or visible some tides. It is sufficient, however, for Arrian's assertion, that this shoal should mark such a spot, which, though visible formerly, may be now con stantly covered by the sea. \" It is very singular that Pliny, lib. vi. c. 21. mentions Crocala as twenty mile3 distant from the Indus, because his twenty, according to d'Anville's reduction of his miles, is exactly ten, as he reckons by the common stadium ; but he read 150 stadia in Nearchus, as we do now, making i8-\u00a7 miles, which he reckons 20. 26 However extraordinary or superfluous an attempt of this kind may appear to modern navigators, the difficulty of carrying a fleet of Greek gallies out to sea in opposition to the monsoon, is at least as great as the danger Xerxes would have encountered in doubling Athos : and even after the neck of that promontory was cut, he had two more to pass. c c 2"], [248, "196 FROM THE INDUS TO CAPE JASK.

At Krokala, Arrian places the commencement of the territory of the Arabies, and its termination at the river Arabis. The aspect of the inner country from the sea, as given by the mo dern journals, is perfectly agreeable to this position and the rising of the land from hence to Cape Monze, consistent Avith the idea I had formed from consideration of the author's text. Weighing from Krokala1', the fleet proceeded to the Avest, having a promontory named Eirus on the right, and a low island almost level with the sea on the left ; this isle runs parallel Avith the coast, and so near as to leave only a narroAV channel19 winding between both.

This harbour, or something to represent it, I have no doubt Avill be found, if ever this coast should be explored again ; for the description of it is very precise in Arrian, and its name (Avhich in the language of the natives signifies the Port of Women) is the only one of Arrian's on this coast, Avhich is re tained by Ptolemy and Marcian of Ileraclea. That the course of the fleet Avas close in Avith the shore is ap parent from the particulars already specified ; and that the monsoon Avas not }ret changed is equally evident from the danger encountered in passing the rocks at Sakala, for if the Avind had been at north-east it Avould have been off the coast ; but it is clear, from the turbulence of the sea, that it still blew from the opposite direction, and lay full upon the shore. Both these assumptions Avill be justified still more by observing that the fol lowing day, Avhcn they left Morontobara, they preferred an intricate course54 between an island and the main, (so narroAV ss that it appeared rather an artificial cut than a natural channel,) to the open passage without side ofthe island. The harbour of Morontobara, with all its conveniences, pre sented nothing to tempt men to a longer delay, Avho for almost forty days had found but a scanty supply of provisions, and seem to have supported life by such casual means as the shell fish on the coast afforded ; they left it therefore on the folloAving \" ment of the sea.

But, notwithstanding this high authority, I am disposed to think, that, in Arrian at least, it is the surf simply, and used frequently without reference to the rock, or rocky ground, which the surf breaks on ; for at Kokala the surf ran so high upon the arrival of the fleet, that the people could not land ; on the following day, however, they all got on shore, hauled up the vessels, and formed a camp. If the rocky shore had been the obstruction, that circumstance would have existed the second day as well as the first.

When we reflect that a Macedonian fleet spent near forty days in com pleting a navigation of this length, Ave may form a judgment of the courage requisite to undertake and execute the Avhole voyage.

Marcian mentions two cities upon the river Arbis, Persis 6S and Rhaprava on the coast betAveen the river and Morontobara ; the distance betAveen the two latter he states at a thousand and fifty stadia, Avhich by no means agrees with Arrian, and gives reason to suspect that he confounded the Port of Women With the Port of Alexander, for his next station is Koiamba, where he fixes the limits of the Pattalene69, possibly the Krokala of Arrian ; and lastly, Rhizan and Rhizana for the termination of the coast, as it should ap pear, at the Indus.

It is worthy of remark that, during the three days' passage from the A'rabis, we hear of no provision being procured except Avater; neither do the places where they anchored appear villages or inhabited country ; if, therefore, the stock of grain which they brought out of the Indus was exhausted, as it probably Avas in an inter val of forty days, Ave can find no means of supporting life, but such a supply of shell-fish as they might have procured at the '\u25a0 In vessels like those of the Greeks, which afforded neither space for motion, or convenience for rest, the continuing on board at night, was always a calamity.

The attention of Alexander is still conspicuous ; and a second unsuccessful attempt 74 he made in Gadrosia, Avhen he Avould have hazarded famine himself to preserve his fleet, ought to exculpate him from the charge of useless vanity in penetrating through that desert region ; a charge which even Nearchus is said to have countenanced.

It is necessary to premise these circumstances, because the stadium of d'Anville is less applicable to this coast, exactly in proportion to the difference betAveen four hundred and fifty, and six hundred and twenty-five ; and as no such variation oc curs in the former part of the voyage, and none so great will occur in the gulph of Persia, it becomes more requisite to point out the causes of variation here ; the principal of Avhich are, the distresses that caused distances to appear longer, at the same time that they engaged the mind too much to alloAV of accurate calculation.

The difficulties this army experienced are foreign from the present purpose, but the atten tion Alexander paid to the preservation of the fleet is connected Avith the voyage ; and a reference to his conduct will tend more effectually to exculpate him from the charge of vanity imputed to him in this part of his expedition, than any other arguments which can be produced.

We cannot, hoAvever, well be mistaken, because the next day's sail is round Cape Arraba . and as no distance is specified for the doubling of that promon tory, the thirty -seven miles applied to the Avhole are sufficiently correspondent : the text does not justify this allotment, but as the Cape is a fixed point, there is little danger of an error. Upon the mention of Ba-Gasira, I must be permitted to no- tice, that the term Gasira indicates an Arabian navigation on. this coast previous to the age of Alexander ; for it is neither more or less than Gesira, signifying in Arabic an island or penin- sula confessedly, and, as I apprehend, a cape likeAvise.

There is a passage in Lieutenant Porter's memoir, which, if I understand it right, confirms the position I assume for Mosarna. \" Cape Posmee appears like the top of an old barn in coming* \" from the eastward, but varies according to its different points \" of vieAv, which I have endeavoured to delineate as exact as \" possible ; and from whence is formed a small bajr, at the bot- \" torn of Avhich is a small town called according to the name of <s the cape^ chiefly inhabited by fishermen.\" Noav if it is al- loAvable to interpret (from whence,) from Cape Posmee, that is to the AvestAvard of Posmee, this position Avould ansAver exactly ; but it is evident the chart does not authorise this, for the chart places the village of Passence or Posmee eastward of the cape, and in the bay formed by the projection ; and here, if the text of Arrian had not been positive to the contrary, I should have placed Mosarna. I state the evidence on both sides, and I confess my disap pointment in not being able to reconcile the apparent difference, as this village is still a point for the caravans to make from within land ; and the dingies ,66, or vessels of the country, still resort hither for dates, cotton, dried hides, and salt-fish ; a trade which gives a relative importance to the place, conformably to my ancient authorities. \"6 Lieutenant Porter. i I 2"], [296, "FROM THE INDUS TO CAPE JASK. 244 At Mosarna, Nearchus found a pilot Avho undertook to con- duct the fleet to the gulph of Persia ; he Avas a native of Ga- drosia, and from the name (Hydrakes) given him by Arrian, I imagine, an inhabitant of Hydriakus, a town near the bay of Churbar or Chewabad, which I shall hereafter have occasion to mention.

In this Table I have given the number of stadia as they an- pear in Arrian and Marcian ; but as all Greek numerals are defective, and as I have already partly accounted for the inac- curacy of Nearchus's reckoning on this coast, so I imagine the numerals in Marcian ,69 are still less to be depended on, his total rarely agreeing with his particulars, and his order of names not being correct. Equally inaccurate are the longitudes of Pto- lemy, and yet, from a comparison of the three, the whole may admit of regulation, and the errors be made mutually to correct each other : of this something more will be said. If I prefer the authority of Arrian, it is not from predilection, but because JNearchus's journal, standing upon each day's work in the order it arose, must be more authentic (if we have a faithful copy of it) than any thing Ptolemy could obtain from the information \u25a0of others. The Table commences from Mosarna, and ends at Bombareek, the Karpella of Ptolemy.

The circumstance of their sailing in the night is likewise to be noticed, for though this may have occurred accidentally before, we shall now find it a prevailing practice ; and as this is an additional proof of the advantage gained by the acquisition of a pilot, it is important to consider the cause which led to the adoption of this practice. I know not that I am authorised to say, it is an universal cause, but doubtless it is general, that in every region within the limits of the trade winds or monsoons, a land breeze blows dur ing the night, and a sea breeze during the day. Mr. Marsden, in his History of Sumatra in, has given a curious and philosophi cal account of the means by Avhich these effects are produced. With the cause I am not concerned, but the effect is, that, \" on the west coast of Sumatra, the sea breeze usually sets in, \" after an hour or two of cairn, about ten in the forenoon, and \" continues till near six in the evening; about seven, the land \" breeze comes off, and prevails through the night,* till towards \" eight in the morning, when it gradually dies away '\".\" This is Mr. Ma rsden's account ; and if his- reasoning upon the cause is just, as apparently it is, it must produce the same effect wherever the same circumstances exist ; and that this effect takes place upon the coast where we are now employed, is a fact capable of proof. Captain David Rannie I74 mentions the land breeze upon this coast, as well as those of Malabar and Guzerat ; and he adds '-\" From p. 15 to p. 19. *M P. 16. 174 In Mr. Dalrymple's Collection, p. 87, et seq."], [300, "FROM THE INDUS TO CAPE JASK. 248 afterwards175 expressly, \" isa land wind blows from these coasts, \" either in the night or moruing, a ship working along may de \" pend upon a sea breeze, or at least a wind along the coast, '\u2022 from the north-westward 17\\ to carry her in shore again, and \" neither is the land or sea breeze ever attended with squalls of '\u25a0 thunder -or rain, as the land winds frequently are on every \u25a0\" coast of India.\" Here is a collection of circumstances dependant on the in variable course of nature, which throws more light upon the .journal we are contemplating than could have been expected to be obtained at the distance of so many ages ; the tranquillity of the sea, the advantage of different breezes, and the security of navigation, all contribute to the accomplishment of this voyage, as a prelude to the communication with India, in vessels of such a sort as must probably have perished on any other coast of equal extent : but there is a peculiarity in this evidence of Cap tain Rannie, that accounts for a circumstance in the voyage which, without it, would have been inexplicable.

This is clearly the reason why we hear nothing in Arrian of Ptolemy's Ala bagium I77, or Alambateir, the prominent feature of this coast: the difficulty was surmounted without danger, and therefore passed over without notice. I anticipate this observation as it is connected with the knowledge of the winds, which we have here acquired, and with the skill of Hy drakes, who was now on board. Balomus is not noticed by Ptolemy or Marcian, nor is their Zorambus mentioned by Arrian ; if, therefore, it had stood in the journal posterior to Barna, instead of prior, there would have been little doubt of its correspondence with Zorambus.

From Dendrobosa the fleet weighed at midnight, and reached Kophas l84, after a passage of twenty-five miles. And here a variety of difficulties arise, which I despair of solving to the satisfaction of the reader. I place Kophas to the eastward of Alambateir, or Cape Guadel, because Ptolemy, Marcian, and Arrian, all concur in the same assertion ; but de la Rochette carries it to the westward, into the bay formed by the projection of that headland. This can hardly be justified in opposition to all the ancient authority we have, however obscure it may be. This cape is the most conspicuous feature upon the whole coast, and forms the termination eastward of a vast imaginary bay, which Ptolemy calls Paragon Sinus, and the author of the Periplus, Terabdon. The western extremity they place at Kar pellal8s, so that if the existence of this bay were established, it would be near three hundred miles across ; but it does not exist. \"4 Ptolemy appears to use this name as a plural, KuQana.

The mistake of Ptolemy (of far less magnitude than his error in regard to the peninsula of India) admits of a solution nearly self-evident; for the fleets from Egypt which sailed with the monsoon from the promontory Syagros in Arabia, if they ever made the coast of Gadrosia, made it at this cape of Alambateir, as a point of eminence, and left all the coast from Cape Jask on their left out of sight ; this naturally raised the idea of a curve inwards, because no land was seen ; and if Ptolemy knew any thing of such vessels as sailed from the gulph of Persia, or if any did in reality lM sail, they also, from the moment they doubled Cape Jask, took advantage of the monsoon, and did not creep along the shore like the fleet of Nearchus, but stood off from one headland to another, and avoided the interruption which the land winds or the nature of the shore presented. It is, therefore, the discovery of Hippalus, the knowledge of the monsoons, which preceded the age of Ptolemy l87, that gave a different idea of this coast to the mariners of his time, from whose information he drew his plan of this great bay ; and it is modern geography alone which has destroyed his curve, and restored the right line of Nearchus.

Good water is a commodity specified in the journal, Which adds, that the place was inhabited by fishermen, who were possessed of small and wretched boats, which they managed with a paddle instead of an oar.

Two islands are noticed by Ptolemy and Marcian in this neighbourhood ; one called Pola, Polla, or Palla, at some dis tance from the coast, for which I can find nothing equivalent ; and another named Libe, Liba, or Zibe, close to Alambateir ; the latter I conclude to be nothing more than this very penin sula of Guadel before us, which may have been an island I9S till connected with the main by the increase ofthe neck of land, or might be considered as such, like the Pharos of Alexandria.

I do not build upon this ; nor do I assert, that the town I am looking for stands where the present town does ; this is doubtless Guttar ; but I can place Nearchus's town any where in the bay that the position of a hummock will justify, and I rather suppose on the western side, as Lieutenant Porter appears to have viewed the hummocks as he entered the bay from the east. When the fleet reached this place, it was totally without bread or grain of any kind ; and Nearchus, from the appearance of stubble in the neighbourhood, conceived hopes of a supply if he could find means of obtaining it ; but he perceived that he could not take the place by assault ; and a siege, the situation he was in, rendered impracticable. He concerted matters, therefore, with A'rchias, and ordered him to make a feint of preparing the fleet to sail, while he himself with a single vessel, pretending to be left behind, approached the town in a friendly manner, and was received hospitably by the inhabitants. They came out to receive him upon his landing, and presented him with baked fish, (the first instance of cookery he had yet seen 1\u00b0 ynXtyv."], [311, "ICTHYOPHAGI. 259 on the coast,) accompanied with cakes M1 and dates \"3.

The circumstance of a cape here determines, in my opinion, the correspondence of all particulars relating to this place ; for this cape must be the western point of Guttar Bay, and all the circumstances unite in giving a position to this nameless town on the Avestern side ofthe bay, as I have done. Lieutenant Porter Avrites, \" The bay 206 is large and deep, Avith \" shoal Avater, and in crossing right over from Noa Point, \" a lump is seen on the opposite shore, Avith an island nearly \" under it, and a little bay called Backer Bundar107, where the \" natives fish, and Avhere the Sanganian pirates often lie in Avait \" for the small vessels that trade along the coast.\" To this lump I had looked for the eminence on which the tOAvn stood, but it is inland, and stands on the high ground behind.

And if it is thought extraordinary that he does not mention a bay here, it is not more so than his omission of Cape Guadel, and it ought to be observed, that Avhen he calls Bagia a cape, a cape necessarily implies an indenture on one side or the other.

Kophas, Alambateir, Kuiza, and Bagia, corresponding in the three authors, conduct us safely to this point ; and thus far there can be no error, unless J[ have assumed Bagia for the western point of Guttar Bay in stead of the eastern : but the reasons already given are more than sufficient for the occasion.

The very next station at Kanasi'da is noted by the journal as a ruined city. Thus has rapine joined with avidity to desolate this coast in all ages.

By a similar process the modern Tanka may be found in the Kanate of Arrian, and the Samy-Kade of Ptolemy ; for Kanat and Kade come by one process from Kienk ; and Samy- Dake, Danke and Tanka by another : if, therefore, upon these grounds Kana-Sida corresponds Avith Tiz or Churbar, and Kanate with Samy-Kade or Tanka, Talmena consequently an swers to the Kandriakes of Ptolemy, and the series in both authors is consistent. It is not necessary to insist on this rea soning as indisputable ; but if Ave find the initial Kan thrice re peated in succession, and three rivers locally agreeing Avith this, and still preserving the traces of the adjunct, it is some light gained in a region of obscurity, and may lead to the just distri bution of the stations on the coast, if it should ever be visited again.

This is a point, indeed, not necessary to discuss, as it is not connected with the voyage; neither is it insisted on farther than as the suspicion of a mistake. Having hoav obtained a probable solution of these difficulties, and found three rivers which may afford the means of recon ciling Arrian Avith Ptolemy, and both Avith modern geography, it remains to conduct the fleet along the coast to the three fol loAving stations of Talmena, Kanasida, and Kanate, Avith a fourth between the tAvo last, Avhich is nameless, and without any distance specified. The fleet Aveighed from Bagia at midnight \"7, and proceeded a thousand stadia, sixty-tAvo miles and an half, to Talmena. This distance, if taken from Noa Point, is not greatly in excess, but tilts assumption the transactions recorded do not authorise ; and there is reason to apprehend that the error of numbers lies somewhere about Guttar Bay, or Kuiza.

My authority for bringing the salt river into this bay is Otter, whom d'Anville interprets agreeably to my supposition : but proof is still Avanting, and the initial Kana is the only evidence Nearchus affords that the stream exists in this place. At the time Churbar was visited by Commodore Robinson's little squadron, the natives Avere desirous of the English settling at Tiz, Avhere they sheAved him the ruins of a Portuguese fort, and informed him that Churbar had been a place of considerable trade in ghee 23\u00b0, silk, tAvilled cotton, and shaAvls, till a six years' drought had reduced the land to a desert23'.

This in telligence agrees Avell Avith Otter's site of Kie232, and argues something for the river supposed to fall in here, or in the neigh bourhood ; for in this tract there can hardly be a city unless where there is a river to supply it. From Kanasida, Nearchus proceeded four-and-tAventy hours Avithout intermission to a desert coast, Avhere he was obliged to anchor at some distance from the shore, as the distress of the people was noAv risen to such a height, that, if he had suffered them to land, he had reason to suspect that they would not haAre returned on board.

Seven hun died and fifty stadia, or forty -seven miles, answer almost ex actly from the eastern point of Churbar Bay [Kanasida] to the Tanka ; and as there is nothing in Arrian to forbid the applica tion of this measure to the tAvo days' course, I shall consider this as a station ascertained. It has already been shewn Iioav the Kanate of Arrian and the Kade of Ptolemy are allied, as Avell as the connection of both Avith Dake, the Danke or Tanka at this place. This connection is verified by the copies of Ptolemy giving Dake234 or Kade indifferently, which is not a various read in 2;, but derived from the fluctuation of Oriental ortho graphv. Whether this Avill be admitted as proof of the identity I cannot say, but such it appears to me ; and on a coast in volved in so much obscurity, every approximation to probability is clear gain. The journal assigns no attributes to Kanate but that of an open shore, with the mention of some shallow Avatercourses, in tended\" possibly for the purposes of agriculture, and the better ing of an arid soil.

There is reason to suspect that both are the same ; for Kiour-kienk is the salt river, and Kiour kies is the salt [river] of Kie. We must abandon, therefore, the inland course of these streams for Avant of information, and content ourselves Avith the issues Ave find upon the coast. The mouth of the Tanka in this place is indisputable ; for it is the Tanka-Banka 2J* of Ressende ; and the Portuguese had a fort about three miles np the stream, the ruins of Avhich, Avith a Bazar and Avells, Avere reported to Lieutenant Porter Avhen he was on the spot Avith Commodore Robinson 2M.

Whether the Greeks had any particular aversion to camels' flesh240, more than Avhatis common to all mankind, avIio nauseate what they are not used to consider as food, I have not discovered ; but it is evident that Nearchus means to give this instance of famine in the extreme, such as Ave at present under stand by the eating of horse-flesh in a besieged toAvn : I feel indeed some concern for the friends Avith whom I have so lono* sailed, that I do not hear of their feasting on the turtle with Avhich this coast abounds. Porter mentions, the turtle in meat abundance at Ashtola ; and Marcian fixes a tribe of Khelono phagi, or turtle-eaters, in the neighbourhood of the spot, where the fleet now is ; but the Greeks seem to have considered men reduced to live wholly upon fish, turtle, or camels, as stamped Avith barbarism ; and the terms expressive of these tribes are used atways as indications of contempt or aversion. 1 do not here mean to draw a conclusion, but I cannot help noticing it as a remarkable coincidence, that Nearchus should find a supply of dates at this station, and that Porter should say 241, \" Between the Tanka and Mucksa, Ave found the land !M Ba^avoi; ix. tpoitU.t.

What the name of this station is, or Avhere it is situated, is no easy matter to determine ; for Arrian's usage of the Avord leads properly to no distinction of it in a Greek form. He Avrites Troisin, which, if plural, leaves great room to doubt of its origin; and Gronovius is disposed to read Taoi. In point of order, it corresponds with the Pasis of Marcian, Avhich Ptolemy Avrites Masis, Magis, Magida, and Mazinda ; and Avhich Mar cian seems to fix at a river M2 called Sarus and Salarus : but this does not admit of proof, for Ptolemy's Magis is five-and-thirty miles to the eastAvard of his Sarus. 'This is of some consequence to note, because by these means I may take his Magis previous to the cape which I assume for Dagasira ; and carry his Sarus AvestAvard to a creek marked in Commodore Robinson's chart, Avhich answers to the Iskim of d'Anville 243, de la Rochette, and Ressende 244. So far Nearchus corresponds Avith Ptolemy's posi tion of Magis, that he intimates no river at Troisi. Upon find ing Makichid mentioned as the name of a river in Mekran, by Otter, I thought I had discovered the clue ; for the corruption or fluctuation of the text in the three authors Avould have justi fied any reading in Arrian : but if Otter's disposition of the Makichid is just, it is far to the eastAvard, and can have no relation to the Magida of Ptolemy. **' The reason for asserting this is, that 3<4 Ressende writes Isqui.

Dec. 15. Seventy-fifth day. Thirty-first station Out of the uncertainty caused by these various authorities, I can extricate myself only by adhering to the measures of Arrian, Avhich, with alloAvance for the excess attending the Avhole of this coast, enable me to place Troisi short of the cape Avhich suc ceeds first westward of the Tanka, and to fix on that cape for the Dagasira of Arrian. The reason for this Avill be assigned hereafter ; but I shall first conduct the fleet to Badis, and then take a review of the coast. From Troisi to Dagasira the course Avas short of nineteen miles. The fleet sailed at day-break 24S ; and as this is the first instance since Hydrakes Avas on board, it may not be improper to .observe, that if Ave fix the hour between six and seven in the morning, the land breeze Avould hold good for an hour or more to secure an offing;. The shortness of the course Avas determined either by this circumstance, or by another Avhich occurs fre quently, the appearance of a cape. This, indeed, is not noticed by Arrian ; but Dah-Gesira perhaps expresses the head of a peninsula or promontory, and there are two capes betAveen the Tanka and Mucksa. From the distance betAveen Dagasira and Badis, I prefer that Avhich is the more eastern. One circum stance only is noticed here, that of meeting Avith a feAv stran gling natives, from Avhom it does not appear that any assistance Avas obtained. Unimportant as this may appear, it preserves a picture of the coast ; and the habits of the natives are the same at the distance of tAventy centuries. \"* Every Avhere alono* the coast,\" says Porter, \" there is a family here and there Avhich 345 vPo P.t 'in.

In one view, their misery seems rather upon the increase ; for if they are not pro vident enough to preserve the date, they are sunk beloAv the condition of their ancestors. Strabo mentions the fruit in its dry state, and Nearchus evidently procured dried fruit at Troisi. The inhabitants are called Brodies by Porter-; but Niebuhr considers them all as Belootches, quite to Jask TA\\ and connects them Avith the Arabs on the opposite side ofthe gulph. If this connection could be established, it Avould not be impossible to extend it through the Avhole Mekran, and to unite the Arabit\u00e6 on the Arabis, with the Arabs of Oman 248. Neither is it un reasonable to suppose that the Arabic names on the coast are a 2*6 Porter, p. 8. Ommana with Kana in Arabia, and Barygaza in India, as a kind of central emporium. The place probably did not exist in the time of Nearchus, but seems to owe its rise to the ex tension of the Arabian commerce towards the east.

Sir William Ouseley is the only author Avho favours this opinion of Niebuhr's ; but the Belootches are in reality a tribe of Aghwans. The distress of the people, and the impossibility of procuring a supply at Dagasira, urged a hasty departure of the fleet. They sailed in the evening, and continuing their course all that night and the folloAving da}*\" Avithout intermission, they reached, after a stretch of almost sixty-nine miles, a promontory project ing far out into the sea, Avith a surf beating upon it to a great extent. This they did not dare to approach, or to double the cape Avhile it Avas dark. They rode at anchor consequently during the night, as near shore as the surf Avould permit, and the folloAving morning got round into a ba}r, Avhere they found the toAvn of Badis, and Avhere they Avere at last relieved from the miseries they had experienced on this desolate coast. This promontory is the boundary betAveen the country of the Icthuo phagi and Karmania ; and at Badis they found corn, vines, and fruit-trees of every kind except the olive, a toAvn inhabited, and the inhabitants ready to relieve their Avants. And noAv having conducted my friends into a place of safety, I must return to survey the coast. The first point necessary to fix is Badis. Badis I place at the cape called Mucksa by Robinson and Porter, and which will presently appear to be the real Jask. The name is written Kan-Theatis, Kan-Thapis, Kan-Eatis, and Kau-Ratis, by Ptolemy and Marcian ; and if 7"], [329, "ICTHYOPHAGI, 277 we prefix Kan to the Badis of Arrian, it bears no little resem- blance to every one of these variations. Kau-Ratis 249, in con- formity to the other three, is necessarily Kan-Ratis 25\u00b0 ; and this differs so little in the form of the Greek letters, that there is no violence used in supposing that Kan-Batis and Kan-Ratis are the same. Noav Kan marks a riven, and Ba-dis, if my conjec tures are right, a bay : both these circumstances are applicable to the spot, for there is a river five miles within this cape ; and at this river I conclude the fleet anchored on the morning of the eighteenth. ;o The fluctuating orthography ofthe Greek text Avill justify still greater liberties than I have taken ; and when it is considered how much the native names of every coast vary in modern charts, Iioav difficult it is to write foreign sounds received by the ear, and hoAv seldom tAvo persons express the same sound by the same letters, there Avill appear no extraordinary licence in the changes adopted upon the present occasion. I never wish to lay more stress on these conjectural criticisms than they de- serve ; and if this explication had stood alone, I should think it of little weight ; but if it shall be found to accord Avith the nature of the coast, Avith the best digestion of the measures at- tainable, and Avith the general course of the fleet, even those who set little value upon etymology Avill alloAV it to contribute its due share to the mass of evidence which ma}* be procured from other quarters. \"\"*\u25a0*\u2022 Kav^aruoi, in Cod.

In order to fix Badis geographically, it is -necessary to en croach on the limits of Karmania, and to find in the first place what is the Karpella of Ptolemy ; for as d'Anville, by conceiv ing that Karpella and Badis are the same, has confused the ac count of the ancient historians, so is it a most extraordinary coincidence, that modern charts and modern navigators have varied equally in fixing the proper site of Cape Jask. It hap pens, that upon the approach to the gulph of Persia there are tAvo capes about tAventy-seven miles asunder ; the easternmost of Avhich is the Cape Mucksa of Robinson, Porter, &c. and the Avesternmost their Cape Jask. Here is the origin of that em barrassment which involves the Avhole question in obscurity, for in reality Mucksa is the true Jask, and their Jask is Cape Bom bareek. It is this BombareeK which is the Karpella of Pto lemy, and consequently when d'Anville brings Badis to this point, he sixes it tAventy-seven miles farther to the Avest than it really is. I shall settle the ancient geography first ; I shall then pro ceed to consider the mistake of the moderns, and give the reasons for pronouncing it an error with so much confidence as I have done. Ptolemy's series comes doAvn the gulph of Persia to Karpella ; and an adherence to his order will give me an opportunity of identifying Karpella Avith Bombareek to a demonstration. Harmozon is a cape opposite to Mussendon, on the Arabian shore, Avhere is the narroAvest part of the streight at the entrance of the gulph ; between Avhich and Karpella are tAvo remarkable eminences, one called Sfcrongylus, or the Round MountaiiT by Ptolemy, near Harmozon, and the other Karpella, from"], [331, "ICTHYOPHAGI. 279 which the promontory derives its name. The former of these is the modern Elbourz, Avhich signifies a fire tower of the Par sees; the latter is the Bombareek rock, Avhich communicates its title to Cape Bombareek, as Karpella did of old. It is true that Strongylus is not enumerated in the series, but stands at the foot ofthe account; its latitude, hoAvever, marks its place.

Mucksa and Karpella are both low points, and the latter not easily discoverable at a distance but by the rock, from which it therefore naturally takes its name. If, then, the Karpella of Ptolemy is fully ascertained, I may proceed to sheAv the fluctuation of the modern accounts in re gard to Cape Jask ; for the suffrages are nearly equal, Avhether it is at Karpella or Mucksa. Lieutenant Porter says, Mucksa has been frequently mistaken for Jask ; and Commodore Ro- binson's chart gives the name of Mucksa to the same cape as Porter ; but Captain Blair 26\u00b0, Avho Avas on board the same fleet, mentions that he Avas on shore at both capes, and that the na tives uniformly agreed in calling the eastern cape, Jask, and the \"s An opportunity is afforded of verifying this meaning, by the same termination applied to a place still more remarkable : Koo-pele is the perforated rock through which the Ganges enters India from the Sewalick mountains at Gang-otri ; and __oo-pcle is evidently rock or mountain pierced. 558 Pietro della Valle writes, Sable delie.

All this evidence collected, Avith the information obtained by Captain Blair on the spot, sets the question so far at rest, that I shall in future call the eastern point regularly Jask or Badis, and the Avestern, Bom bareek or Karpella. The mistake committed by d'Anville, in supposing Karpella and Badis to be the same, is founded upon, and supported by another error; for he read in the translation of Arrian, that there was a rock263 at this point, and, in order to establish the identity of Badis Avith Karpella, he Avent six or eight miles north to fetch the Bombareek rock to the cape. Unfortunately for this system* the Greek text says nothing of a rock, but uses that term264, Avhich I interpret surf or breakers, and Avhich, Avith Gronovius to support me, I can maintain against all the trans- 283 Memoir, p. 140. these, the principal feature of Bombareek, its perforation, is omitted.

D'Anville is misled by the Neptune Oriental, where such a bay is described ; and the Nep tune or d'Apres is misled by misconceiving our English authorities, without seeing the chart. Jask bay appears in the Neptune almost due south of Bombareek, instead of south-east. In this short account there are four inaccu racies. 1. There is no bay (Anse), but only a creek. 2.

The extent of the surf na turally implies the extent ofthe projection ; and if extent is not the peculiar feature of Jask, in opposition to Bombareek, there is no truth either in the plan of Baffin or the sketch of Blair : add breakers to this projection, and the picture is complete. But we may advance one step farther still, for Arrian says ex pressly, that from this cape the course Avas no longer Avest, but north-Avest. This is true of Jask, but not of Bombareek ; for from Bombareek the course Avould be almost due north. Let us hear modern authority upon this point. Cutler, in his Coasting Pilot, fixes the same points for Jask and Bombareek as Captain Blair ; and he asserts 2W, that \" from Guadel to Jask \" the coast lies west by north, and east by south ;\" but \" from \" the point of Jask to the Ioav point of Bombareek the course is * north-west.\" These are the grounds upon which I venture to assert, that d'Anville is mistaken at the commencement of his discourse ; but it is an error arising, not from Avant of research or discern ment, but from the materials 26? he had to work upon ; and from has brought it from eight miles distance, and then it is not in the sea, but on a sandy jilain near three miles from the shore. xxi ra_ pax'_\"S f-vta.

In the Table I have ventured to form, Agan'sa, and then transpose the syllables so as to extract Agasfra or Dagasira from it. If the reader should doubt the propriety of these transpositions, I must observe that the cor ruption is not merely European, but Oriental also. Gezira is a town of some note on the Tigris, near Merdin, and takes its name from being surrounded on three sides by a winding of the river. Dr. Howel, who came by this route from Basra to Constantinople, says, the natives call it Jessecra or Geraza. (See his Journal 1788, p. 79.) If he had written both words, as he ought to have done, with the same letters transposed, we should have had the very transposition from the natives for which I contend : \u2014 Gerisa, Gesira ; Jesseera, Jereessa. The errors which arise between the eye, the ear, and the mouth, in hearing, writing, and pronouncing, are beyond calcu lation, besides those which proceed from ig norance. Two instances are before me which may cause the reader to smile. The English translator of Bcrnier's Travels makes the French physician say, that he was hospitably entertained by the English at Calcutta, who treated him with an excellent liquor called Bouleponge. The translator never once sus pected that his countrymen made a bowl of punch. A second occurs in Pietro della Valle. His French translator says, he embaiked in an English ship at Gomroon, called the Vubali. This strange word is nothing more than the Whale. But the Frenchman, having no w in his own language, wrote two u's, or rather Vu, and then turned an Italic h into a b ; thus Whale became Vubali.

Is it arrogance to say that this amounts to demonstration ? At Badis is the boundary between Karmania and the desolate coast of the Icthu6phagi ; and at this limit I must pause, to consider the sum of Arrian's measures, and to compare them Avith the actual extent of the coast. This labour indeed is shortened by the Table already given from Mosarna, compre hending seven thousand four hundred stadia out of the ten thousand Avhich form Arrian's total between Malana and Badis ; but this total, like many others, differs from its particulars, for the numbers from Malana to Mosarna stand thus : Stadia. 600 200 600 200 150 Rook2\", 400. 1750 250 from Rook. 2000 7400 to Badis. 9400 To Bagasira, To Kolta, To Kalama, To Kuiza, To Mosarna, is mentioned also by Purchas, vol. iii. p. 1789* dred and fifty 8tadia are signed t\u00b0 the cape 1-90.

To this sum Rook adds six hundred %li stadia, for a distance omitted betAveen Kanasida and Kanate, to make up the ten thousand of Arrian. These six hundred I have omitted, from the pressure of numbers too high on that part of the coast, and comprehended the Avhole two days' course in the seven hundred and fifty stadia to Kanate. Nothing, however; is gained by this ; for though it eases the measure on the coast, it still dis agrees with the total. It is not a little remarkable, that Strabo's 274 measure of the Avhole coast should be the precise sum that Arrian reckons from Mosarna, seven thousand four hun dred ; and as Marcian and Ptolemy extend the limits of Kar mania to Mosarna, if I had found the same number in Marcian, I should have concluded Strabo had been misled by some boundary of the same kind : but Marcian's total from Badis to Mosarna is four thousand six hundred, and from Karpella one thousand more. I shall produce a reason likeAvise presently, why I think Marcian reckoned by a different stadium : but let us first observe, that by Arrian's total, 10,000 stadia produce \u2014 625 British miles, Strabo's 7,000 \u2014 \u2014 46\"2| Commodore Robinson's chart, \u2014 480 27S 625 480 so that the excess upon the Avhole coast, by Arrian's numbers, is 145 miles, and Strabo's comes much nearer to the truth.

It is not just to charge Nearchus with a design of lengthening this navigation, in order to enhance the difficulty or the danger : but distress and famine make every passage appear longer than it is, as mariners assure me ; and Avhen the fleet under the guidance of Hydrakes kept at a farther distance from shore than Greek pilots Avould have dared, it is probable that measures Avere ascertained Avith less correctness, or inflamed by conjecture. Marcian, in the proem to his work, has fully stated the difficulty of obtaining correct distances by means of itineraries and journals ; some measure by a right line, some by the curvature of the coast, and all in general exceed the truth. That this, therefore, should take place in the narrative before us, Avill not appear extraordinary to those who know that the length of the Mediterranean Avas estimated by the longitudes of Ptolemy till the last century, and that it was curtailed of near twenty-five degrees by observation 276, no farther back than the reign of Lewis XIV. led-j-ed here ; for the former measure was taken to Karpella, twenty-seven miles west of Jask, as I did not at that time know the real distinction between these capes.

Ptolemy 277 places Karpella in longitude 27S 94\u00b0, and Mosarna 103\u00b0 15' ; the interval is conse quently 9\u00b0 15' of longitude ; and, upon the same interval, Marcian reckons five thousand six hundred stadia, Avhich brings his estimate to six hundred and twenty- two stadia for a degree of Ptolemy's. Let us then advert to the common cal culation of the Greeks, six hundred stadia 1T9 to a degree, and avc immediately discover, that Marcian's stadium approaches the Olympian, of eight to a Roman mile, and not the stadium of Arrian, Avhich is nearly fifteen to the same measure. In order to apply this estimate then to the case before us, let us next take the measures betAveen Mosarna and Badis. The stadia 2!o of Arrian are seven thousand four hundred upon this interval, and those of Marcian four thousand six hundred : but as Arrian's stadia are fifteen to a mile Roman, they produce four hundred and ninety-two 28' miles Roman ; and as Marcian's are eight to the same measure, they give five hundred and seventy-five miles Roman. From this deduction, therefore, it is manifest that the estimation of the coast by Marcian is more in excess than Arrian's statement ; and upon repetition of this ex- :\" See supra. 2,9 D'Anville reckons six hundred, Gos sellin seven hundred, for a degree of a g~eat circle : the ordinary and usual estimate is six. hundred and twenty.

Even in his error, I find the means of elucidating his narrative ; for there is little reason to object to the position of the stations in the order they appear, but the discordance of the measures. This discordance affects, in reality, only one place upon which there remains any just reason to doubt; that is, Troisi. If this be carried to the Sarus, Dagasira must be fixed at the second cape Avestward ofthe Tanka, instead of the first; and this encroaches as much on the measures betAveen that cape and Badis, as the contrary supposition does on the distance betAveen the Tanka and the first cape.

The fish is generally eaten raw, just as it is taken out of the water, at least such as is small and penetrable ; but the larger sort, and those of more solid texture, they expose to the sun, and pound 2SS them to a paste for store : this they use instead of meal 2S' or bread, or form Guinea ; they are probably Malay, as the vo cabularies of their language seem to prove. 1,5 Those who are acquainted with the coast of Kent will recollect a similar practice in Sandwich Bay, called Pcgwell Bay from this circumstance, where the nets are of much greater extent ; Arrian says two stadia (equal perhaps to two hundred and eight yards Eng lish), meaning to express a great length. I am aware that the expression may be judged to interfere with the small stadium of d'Anville, but every thing is small or great by comparison ; and if the ordinary Greek net was less than two hundred yards, this is consequently large. 266 Diodorus from Agatharcid'es varies some what in the account, p. 184. 189 xaraXutrt;, rendered by Vulcanius, Ma jores vero durioresque ad so/em torrentes simul ac penilus tosti fuerint molentes in farinam redigunt ; that is, they grind them and make a paste or caviar of them.

But there is a second tale too singular to be passed Avithout observation, for aac are informed that the Icthuophagi derive their origin and manners from a race of men Avho frequented these seas, and Avho having by chance or enchantment landed on an island named N6sala, Avere there entertained by a Nereid, and afterwards transformed into fish. Fortunately for the metamorphosed, this spot Avas under the protection of the Sun, who, displeased equally at the cruelty of the nymph as her licentiousness, ordered her to depart the island. She submitted to the decree, and Avas preparing for her exile ; but, as a last effort, she hoped by a 'display of her charms to entangle the god, and involve him in the same fate i0* as his predecessors in her favour had experienced. How great Avas her mortification, when she found him inattentive to her allurements, and em ployed in a second transformation of her lovers into their native figure ? From these men, so happily restored, the Icthuophagi derive 3os their origin. Arrian 3<* is offended at Nearchus, first for recording this fable, and then for refuting it : but the story is perfectly Greek ; for the Nereid is only Circe, or Calypso, conveyed to the East Indies, and Apollo is Ulysses, but Avith more continence.

The best excuse for introducing; this tale is, that Nearchus had lost one of his transports manned with Egyptians, and the re port Avas current in the fleet that the vessel had disappeared at an enchanted island ; Nearchus ordered out a party to visit this isle, and call aloud the names of those Avhom he supposed to have been shipwrecked. Not content with this, he Avent him self to the place, and compelled his people to land, much against their inclination ; but they found neither their lost companions nor the Nereid. Possibly even this excuse will not be admitted ; for no island occurs on the Avhole coast after leaving Ashtola, except a very small one in Guttar Bay, Avhich must have been seen on the day the nameless toAvn Avas taken, and Avhich lay too clearly in view to cause these idle terrors. If any island exists, it ought to unite the Asthea of Ptolemy with the Ashtola of our modern charts ; but as the Avhole is a fable, an attempt at consistency may be rather curious than necessary. Still, fable as it is, like many other fables, it is not Avithout its ostensible origin from the native superstition ofthe inhabitants.

Under all these disadvantages, if the object Avas attained, and the voyage com- pleted, it is not the length of the course that ought to raise the name of Columbus higher than that of Nearchus; the conse- quences derived from the discoveries of both are equally im- portant, and the commerce Avith the East Indies upon a level Avith that of America : but if the communication fixed at Alex- andria is the origin of the Portuguese discoveries, and the cir- cumnavigation of Africa, Nearchus is in fact the primary author of discovery in general, and the master both of Gama and Columbus. There is one extraordinary circumstance attending this ex pedition, which is, that we find little mention of mutiny and none of disease among the people : the former would be na turally checked by their situation, for they had no second hope if they failed in the execution of their enterprise, and no chance of preservation but by obedience to their commander ; the latter was less likely to occur, from the circumstances peculiar to the navigation ; and the maladies arising from famine or bad provi sions appear not to have had sufficient time to exhibit their Avorst effects : as far as can be collected from the journal, they Avere"], [356, "3o2 FROM THE INDUS TO CAPE JASK. never Avithout shell-fish till within a few days of their arrival ; and scorbutic disorders, which are the scourge of the mariner in the protracted voyages of the moderns, are never noticed by the ancients.

The bare assertion that the thing had been done might lead Alexander to think it practicable ; but the Persian voyage pro duced no consequences Avhatever, and the Egyptian navigation led to nothing, unless we suppose the Portuguese discoverers influenced by the assertion \"4, that a passage round the Cape Avas practicable. Scylax ought to be a Greek by the place of his nativity, Caryanda, or at least an inhabitant of Asia Minor ; but we have no remains 3IS of his journal, and no other evidence of his voyage but the report of Herodotus, Avliich is very deficient in circum stances to confirm its own authority ; and collateral evidence there is none.

Pliny, lib. ii. cap. 7*3, seems to intimate, that it was dug by Eratosthenes at the time he was mea suring an arc of the meridian. The follow ing observations are kindly communicated by the Bishop of St. Asaph : Plutarch says, that in his time the gnomons at Suene were no longer shadowless on the solstitial day. This is very strange. Era tosthenes died, according to Blair's Tables, ia the year before Christ 194 ; and Plutarch died in the year of Christ 119. The interval, therefore, between them was only 314 years ; and the change of the obliquity of the ecliptic in this time (the only cause to which I can re fer the alteration) was no more than 2' 36\". A gnomon, therefore, at Suene of the length of twelve inches, if it cast no shadow on the day of the solstice, in the time of Eratosthe nes, should have cast a shadow, in the time of Plutarch, of the length only of -n^^ths, i. e. not quite -r^sth of an inch. The shadow of a perpendicular column of the height of 100 feet would have been *i%ths of an inch. But I can hardly think the ancients ever thought of constructing gnomons of such a size. We read, indeed, in the Comedians, of shadows of ten, The well, besides that it was sunk perpen dicularly with the greatest accuracy, was, I suppose, in shape an exact cylinder. Its breadth must have been moderate, so that a person, standing upon the brink, might safely stoop enough over it to bring his eye into the axis of the cylinder, where it would be per pendicularly over the centre of the circular surface of the water. The water must have stood at a moderate height below the mouth of the well, far enough below the mouth to be sheltered from the action of the wind, that its surface might be perfectly smooth and mo tionless ; and not so low, but that the whole of its circular surface might be distinctly seen by the observer on the brink.

Half an hour before sunset, a gnomon of the height of one foot would cast a shadow ten feet long. And in the same la titude, at the same season, a gnomon of the height of six feet would cast a shadow of the length of ten feet so early as eleven minutes after three in the afternoon. I think the \u2022mall variation that took place, between the time of Eratosthenes and that of Plutarch, would be more easily discovered by the well than by any gnomon the ancients can be sup posed to have used. 322 Pocock, B. ii. p. j 1 7.

There is, however, another way of inquiry into the discoveries attributed to the earliest times, which is, by examining the com modities such discoveries Avould produce. Tin, the staple of Britain, is mentioned in the most ancient authors neither as a rare, nor a very precious metal ; this must have been intro duced to the nations on the Mediterranean, either by a trans port over land (such as is mentioned by Diodorus 329), or through the medium of a Ph\u0153nician naAdgation : the existence ofthe metal, therefore, in Greece and Asia is a proof that the inter course Avas established in some sense or other. The sudden in flux of gold into Judea349 is equally a proof of a commerce extended into the Indian or Ethiopic ocean, beyond the limits of the gulph of Arabia.

But I find one reason for inclining to Colonel Capper's, because the Arabs who sail out of the gulph of Persia take their departure with a Salam, or salutation of peace, from Mosalem or Mo tjandon, on the opposite coast ; and may well salute Bombareek as the entrance to the gulph on their return. If this be admitted, Co- Mobareek stands fairest for the true appella tion ; but when the Orientalists differ so widely from each other, they should be spanner of their strictures upon those who profess them selves unskilled in this branch of literature. Mosalem is a participle of an Arabic verb, de rived from the Hebrew CibD' Salami to salute ; in the same form as Mobareek from Barack. Pliny is nearer the truth than d'Anville chooses to allow. Arrian says, it is a day's sail.

Even in this case, the distance Avill fall short only eight miles ; this is the extent of the difference, and many of the measures on the coast of Karmania will partake of the same deficiency. It may seem extraordinary that such a rock as Bombareek, and a mountain like Elbourz, which had evidently attracted the notice of mariners in the age of Ptolemy, should be passed in silence by the journal ; but similar instances are not unfrequent ; errors of addition there are none, but omis sions have already occurred, and there are some more to oc cur '6 in the course of the navigation : but it is observable, upon more occasions than the present, that a rock, an headland, or a river, hoAvever unnoticed, attracts the fleet to an anchorage * and this is probably the case with Elbourz in the instance before us.

Every where along this coast a range runs in a line at no great distance from the sea, inclosing the Kermesir, a narrow strip of level country rendered hot beyond measure, and unhealthy, from the Avant of circulation.

The bare mention of Ormuz is sufficient to attract our notice to the celebrated emporium of that name established in the isle of Gerun, which flourished to such a degree in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, as to excite the envy and jealousy of all the Arabian tribes on one side the gulph, and the king of Persia on the other. The trade with India, and perhaps with China, had in more ancient times been fixed at Maskat and Sohar on the Arabian side, and afterwards at Shi raff and Keish on the coast of Persia ; but Gerun, the most barren island in the gulph, derived, from the advantage of its situation, a preference to all the other marts which had partaken of this commerce.

When the place Avas taken, the last king Avas conveyed as a prisoner up to Ispahan through Lar at the time Pietro della Valle Avas resident in that city.

The march Avas probably a procession of joy and triumph, for the army Avas not only croAvned Avith victory, but delivered from famine ; but that it Avas a pomp of licence, revelry, and voluptuousness, as painted by Plutarch and Q. Curtius, is a fiction, as Arrian assures us, not supported by Ptolemy, Aristobulus, or any other historian of authority. They both mention the exhibition of games and a solemn sacrifice in gratitude for the deliverance experienced. These Avere easily magnified into a Bacchanalian procession, by a fertile imagination, and exaggerated on the side of exultation, as much as the distresses in Gadrosia had been amplified by terror.

If this conjecture be founded, it corresponds admirably Avith Arrian, for Nearchus found no city, but a district called the Harmozeian country, and probably the seat of government Avas at that period the inland Hormoz, existing as a kingdom or province of Ormuz, nearly in the same manner as in the age of Timour.

One circumstance, hoAvever, must not be omitted, Avhich is, that the position of Giroft depending on the Gadrosian Poora, or Phoreg, it is remarkable that the Nubian Geographer 77 places Phoreg at the commencement of the great desert Avhich extends to Segestan, and at two hun dred and ten miles 7\" distance from the capital of that province. It is the lowrer part of that desert which Alexander had just passed ; and this furnishes an additional proof to the direction of his march, and a stronger reason for conducting it to Giroft instead of Seirdgian the capital, because, if he had inclined to the north, his course would still have been through the same desert Upon the arrival of the army in Karmania, intelligence Avas received that Philip, the neAV-appointed satrap of India, had been assassinated by the native troops in his pay, and his death reArenged by the Macedonians.

All these circumstances, though foreign to the voyage itself, are necessary to be mentioned at least, because they account for the delay of Alexander in the province, where so much busi ness 8l appears to have been transacted, besides the recovery of his troops after the fatigue and distress of their march. Thus having considered the march of the army and its present position, I shall next examine the dates. Nearchus reached the A'namis on the tAventieth of December, and it is no matter of difficulty to sheAv the correspondence of that date Avith the movements of the army. It has already been proved that Alexander left Pattala in the latter end of August, see p. 181 ; and before the conclusion of that month, there is sufficient evi dence to shew, that he had passed the country of the Arabies and Orit\u00e6, and had entered Gadrosia. The proof of this is, a circumstance mentioned of his encamping in that province, after a distressful march upon the bank of a torrent, Avhich sAvelled suddenly from rain that had fallen in the mountains, and swept aAvay all the baggage of those Avho, for the convenience of Avater, had pitched their tents too near the course of the stream. This fact is recorded both by Strabo and Arrian ; and ft proves that, though no rain falls in Cadr6sia, the solstitial rains were not yet over in the mountains Avhich encircle that province on the north. Now Strabo says, that the rains end about the rising I !', p8, ..*' . \u25a0\u25a0\u2022\u25a0. . \u00b0f Siburtius to the satrapy of Apollophanes, At Peora there was also the appointment over the Oritte."], [403, "KARMANIA. 341 of Arcturus 8s, that is, the second of September ; and conse- quently the army must have been in Gadrosia, and suffered this calamity, in the latter end of August. If, therefore, Ave add another fact to this, upon the authority of Arrian, that the array Avas sixty days in passing Gadrosia, avc bring its arrival at Poora to the end of October. The business transacted here and in Karmania may reasonably be supposed to have occupied six Aveeks, to Avhich an additional circumstance, not noticed by the historians, must be added, that is, the remounting of the cavalry ; for all the horses had perished in the desert. Thus far a comparison of facts Avould authorise the fixing of a date to the first or second Aveek in December ; but we have a positive proof of the season much stronger ; for when Alexander, after receiAr- ing Nearchus, recommenced his march to the northward, he dispatched Hephestion, Avith the greater part of the army, the baggage, and the elephants, to proceed along the sea-coast of Karmania, because it was now Winter84, and the climate'5 Avas there milder 86, and supplies \"7 Avere more easily to be pro cured : that is, Hephestion passed the mountains, and traversed the modern Moghostan 8S and Laristan, or Kermesir, Avhile 83 Strabo, p. 691.

The direct mention of winter in this passage cor responds so precisely with the tAventieth of December, Avhich the narrative of the journal produces, that there cannot possibly be an error of more than a feAv days. Such an error, I have before intimated, must lie on the side of excess ; and 1 am dis posed to take off the ten days and fix Nearchus's arrival at the A'namis on the tenth of December, in the year three hundred and tAventy-six before the Christian \u00e6ra, in the eleventh year of the reio*n of Alexander.

They instantly hurried the stranger Avith all the tumult of joy to Nearchus ; in his presence, the same happy discovery Ayas repeated, with assurances that the king Avas Avithin five days' journey, and that the governor of the province Avas upon the spot, from Avhom farther intelligence might be obtained. This circumstance of good fortune occurred on the day of their arrival. Nearchus instantly determined to undertake the journey, and the next day ordered the ships to be draAvn on shore, and the camp to be fortified. While he Avas engaged in these transactions, the governor, Avho Avas not unacquainted Avith the anxiety of Alexander on account of the fleet, and thinking to recommend himself by carrying the first intelligence of its arrival, hurried up to the camp by the shortest route, and gaining admittance to the king, informed him that the fleet Avas safe, and that Nearchus himself was coming up in a few days. The joy of Alexander may be readily conceived, notAA'ithstanding he could scarcely alioAv himself to give full credit to the report. Impatience succeeded to his doubts ; day passed after day Avithout confirmation of the fact ; and at length when due alloAv- ance had been made, and calculation Avas exhausted, he dis- patched parties different Avays in search of Nearchus, either to find him out if he Avere upon his road, or, if found, to protect him from the natives : but when several of these parties returned Avithout success, concluding the governor's information Avas a delusion, he ordered him into confinement, not Avithout the severest reproaches for rendering his vexation more acute from the disappointment of his hopes."], [406, "GULPH OF PERSIA. 344 In this state of suspense he continued for several days, mani festing by his outAvard deportment the anguish he suffered in his heart. Nearchus, however, Avas actually on the road ; and, Avhile he Avas proceeding Avith Archias and five or six others in his company, fortunately fell in with a party from the army, which had been sent out Avith horses and carriages for his ac commodation. The admiral and his attendants, from their appearance, might haA*e passed unnoticed. Their hair long and neglected, their garments decayed, their countenances pale and weather-worn, and their persons emaciated by famine and fa tigue, scarcely rouzed the attention of the friends they had en countered. They were Greeks, however, and of Greeks it Avas natural to inquire after the arm}*, and where it Avas noAv en camped. An answer Avas given to their inquiry ; but still they were neither recognised by the party, nor Avas any question asked in return. Just as they were separating from each other, \" Assuredly,\" says Archias, \" this must be a party sent out for \" our relief; for on what other account can they be Avandering \" about tire desert ? There is nothing strange in their passing us \" Avithout notice, for our very appearance is a disguise. Let us \" address them once more, and inform them who Ave arc, and \" learn from them on what service they are at present em \" ployed.\" Nearchus approved of this advice, and approach ing them again, inquired which way they were directing their course ? \" We are in search of Nearchus and his people,\" re plied the officer;\u2014 and \"I am Nearchus,\" said the admiral; \" and this is Archias ; take us under your conduct, and Ave Avill \" ourselves report our history to the king.\" They were accord ingly placed in the carriages, and conducted towards the army Avithout delay. While they were upon their progress, some of"], [407, "KARMANIA. 345 the horsemen, impatient to carry the news of this happy event, set off for the camp to inform the king, that Nearchus and Archias Avere arrived, Avith five or six attendants, but of the rest they had no intelligence. This suggested to Alexander, that perhaps these only Avere preserved, and that the rest of the people had perished, either by famine or shipwreck ; nor did he feel so much pleasure in the preservation of the few, as dis tress for the loss of the remainder. During this conversation, Nearchus and his attendants arrived. It Avas not Avithout diffi culty that the king discovered who they Avere, under the disguise of their appearance ; and this circumstance contributed to con firm him in his mistake, imagining that both their persons and their dress bespoke shipAvreck, and the destruction of the fleet. He held out his hand hoAvever to Nearchus, and led him aside from his guards and attendants, Avithout being able to utter a word ; as soon as they Avere alone, he burst into tears, and con tinued Aveeping for a considerable time ; till at length recovering, in some degree, his composure, \" Nearchus,\" says he, \" I feel \" some satisfaction in finding that you and Archias have \" escaped ; but tell me Avhere, and in Avhat manner, did my \" fleet and my people perish ?\" \" Your fleet,\" replied Near chus, \" is all safe, your people are safe, and Ave are come to \" bring you the account of their preservation.\" Tears, but from a different source, noAv fell much faster from his eyes ; \" AVhere, \" then, are my ships ?\" says he. \" At the A'namis,\" replied Nearchus : \" all safe on shore, and preparing for the comple \" tion of their voyage.\" \" By the Libyan Ammon, and the \" Jupiter of Greece, I sAvear to you,\" rejoined the king, \" that \" I am more happy at receiving this intelligence, than in being \" the conqueror of all Asia ; for I should have considered the y y"], [408, "GULPH OF PERSIA. 346 \" loss of my fleet, and the failure of this expedition, as a coun \" terbalance to all the glory I have acquired.\" \u2014 Such Avas the reception of the admiral, Avhile the governor, Avho Avas the first bearer of the glad tidings, Avas still in bonds : upon the sight of Nearchus, he fell at his feet and implored his intercession. It may be Avell imagined that his pardon Avas as readily granted as it Avas asked. The joy Avas noAv universal through the army ; a solemn sacrifice Avas proclaimed in honour of Jupiter the preserver, of Hercules, of Apollo the averter of destruction, of Neptune, and every deity of the ocean : the games Avere celebrated, and a splendid procession exhibited, in Avhich Nearchus Avas the prin cipal ornament of the pomp, and the object Avhich claimed the attention of every eye. FloAvers and chaplets Avere Avreathed for his head, and shoAvered upon him by the grateful multitude, Avhile the success of his enterprise Avas proclaimed by their ac clamations, and celebrated in their songs. At the conclusion of the festival, the king informed Nearchus, that he should no longer expose him to the hazard of the sea, but send doAvn some other officer to conduct, the fleet to Susa. \" I am bound to \" obey you,\" replied the admiral, \" as my king, and I take a \" pleasure in my obedience ; but if you Avish to gratify me in \" return, suffer me to retain my command, till I have com \" pleted the expedition. I shall feel it as an injustice, if, after \" having struggled through all the difficulties of the voyage, \" another shall finish the remainder almost Avithout an effort \" and yet reap the honour of completing Avhat I have be-nin.\" Alexander, scarcely permitting him to conclude his request, granted all that he desired, and sent him doAvn again to the coast, Avith a small escort ; not supposing that there Avas any"], [409, "KARMANIA. 347 danger in the neighbourhood of the army, or in a country Avhich seemed to be sufficiently subdued : but in this he was mistaken ; the Karmanians resented the deposition 9* of their satrap, and had in consequence taken up arms, and seized some of the strong places in the province ; Avhile Tlepolemus the new appointed governor had not yet had time to establish his autho rity. It happened, therefore, that Nearchus encountered tAvo or three parties of the insurgents on his march, and reached his distination at last, not Avithout considerable difficulty. Upon joining again the companions of his voyage, he sacrificed to Jupiter the preserver, and exhibited the usual games M for his success. The interview of Alexander and Nearchus needs no comment ; but I cannot set the fleet afloat again till I have observed, that there is nothing in the original to contradict the conjecture I have made, that Nearchus took the route of Mina to cross the mountains, in his way to Giroft; that he had passed them, and was on his fifth day's journey, Avhen he met with the party which conducted him to the army ; and that the natives he en countered on his return were probably straggling bodies who had secured themselves in the passes above Mina'4; it ap- 91 See a note of Gronovius's upon nrt>._u rixti, on this passage : who proves, that it does not mean \" put to death,\" but \" de \u00ab posed,\" p. 352- says it is some leagues from the coast. He did not visit it ; and therefore his distance must be from report. Vol. ii. p. 142. Eng. edition. But I have no direct authority for fixing either Mina or the A'namis precisely. If d'Anville is correct, the site I give for the river is too much towards the south ; and if I am mistaken, the measures of Arrian mislead me. His error, if proved, must lie between Neoptana and the A'namis. Some of our English officers who have been at Gomeroon must be able to determine the position of the river Ibrahim. 93 The king celebrated an dy_Yta xa\\ yvfi.tixot ; Nearchus's was only yvfitixit. The /xao-'xov, or trial of mental talents, seems always to have made a part of Alexander's games ; the yufauwt, that is, the trial of bodily strength, or address, was suitable to the situ ation of Nearchus ; he bad probably no i__<tixqi, bards, orators, or musicians in his company. 9' Niebuhr writes this name Minau ; and y y e"], [410, "GULPH OF PERSIA. 348 Oaracta Island.

But a second I03 founda tion for this term has been adopted by some modern geo graphers, Avhich is entitled to consideration : for it has been observed that the Porphyry Mountains, Avhich line the Avestern coast of the Gulph of Arabia from Suez to a considerable ex tent, exhibit a splendid redness from the reflexion of the sun : and as the navigation commenced from Suez or Arsinoe, it is not unreasonable to suppose the mariners carried this name Avith them from the appearance Avhich first occurred, and ex tended it to the ocean Avith which this gulph communicated.

A variety of the authorities before me place a towm on the eastern promontory, and, whatever its name be, here I place the Sidod6ne of the journal. In this I am directed principally by the shoal off Basidu, or Bassadore,. at the Avestern extremity of Kismis ; for if it is natural that a Greek fleet should seek the coast again as soon as it was clear of the island, and had pursued a course the day before for that purpose, till deterred by the shoal ; it is plain, the same object was'invieAV upon departing from Tumbo, and that the course pointed as directly to the main as the extremity of the shoal would alloAv.

I have already noticed the disagreement of d'Anville and M'Cluer, in the transposition of the tAvo capes, which is well worthy of consideration ; for though Sidodone is an obscure place, and the difficulties minute, * the fixing of a position is material, as an error at the beginning might vitiate the whole series.

If, therefore, Ave observe that Nearchus Avas at Tumbo, Ave have here his course pointed out to the cape, and his island Pulora on the left, as distinctly as if M'Cluer had been on board the fleet. M'Cluer next lays down a second cape twenty miles to the Avestward of Certes, Avhich he styles Bestion (the Tarsia of Nearchus) ; and betAveen these two capes, he says, there is a toAvn called Charrack. Noav M'Cluer may have misnamed Certes, Bestion, and Charrack ; but the geography is precise, and this toAvn, Avhatever name it bears, is placed at his Cape Certes by all the other Charts, and by d'Anville himself. Whatever error, therefore, avc may find in names, there is none in fact ; for a very small distance alloAved, in placing the town a little to the Avestward of this Certes, will give the nineteen miles of Arrian from Sidodone to Tarsia ; and in this part the journal is peculiarly correct.

SomeAvhcre at the foot of Charrack, and nearly opposite to Keish, stood the toAvn of Siraff, noticed by Al- Edrissi as a seat of commerce in his time, and connected with Keish, as Gomeroon Avas afterwards Avith Ormuz. In the ninth century Siraff143 Avas a port of importance ; for it seems in that early age to have been in the possession of the Arabians, and the centre of an Oriental commerce Avhich perhaps extended to China; both Kataia144 and Siraff fell into decay, as Ormuz rose into consequence long before the Portuguese were masters of that island ; and though Siraff is noAv in ruins according to d'Anville, Charrack (the Tsj\u00e6rak of Niebuhr) exists very nearly in the same site ,45, and is still the residence of an Arab Sheik. The measures upon this coast proving as erroneous from defi- ciency, as those on the coast of the Icthyophagi from excess, it becomes necessary to specify the default, for Avhich no better excuse can be given than the situation of Nearchus in both instances. If distress magnified the length of his former mea- sures, ease and security appear to have diminished these on the coast of Karmania. The detail stands thus : 143 See the voyage of two Arabians from Renaudot, in Harris's Collection, vol. i. p. 523.

Both Ptolemy and Marcian fix the limits of Karmania at the river Bagrada ; but as theyr disagree with Arrian in carrying the eastern boundary to Mosarna, and this river on the Avestern border is not very clearly determined by modern geography, it will, if not essential, be some gratification to curiosity at least, to examine Ptolemy's list of rivers, and try Avhether any light can be derived from the order he has given them.

The fleet Aveighing from Kataia arrived, after a course of tAventy-five miles, at Ila, an anchorage on the coast covered by the island Kaikandros.

M'Cluer has rendered a second service in laying doAvn this isle nearer to the main than it appears in most of the other charts, for so Arrian describes it, as covering the road and mak ing the anchorage secure.

We have noAv, hoAvever, tAvo islands accuratelyr placed in M'Cluer's second chart, which agrees better with Arrian than his first, and by the position of these we must determine the course.

If I am right, therefore, in assuming Schitwar for Arrian's nameless island, the remainder of this day's course is clear ; for the forty stadia he allots for crossing from hence to the main, is nearly equal to the breadth of the channel betAveen SchitAvar and the eastern point of the river Darabin, where I suppose the first anchorage to be ; and the second, only by crossing the river to the Avestern point, or some convenient bay adjoining. This is the apparent reason why no distance is mentioned here, Avhile the measure between Inderabia and Schitwar is an omission. M'Cluer marks an anchorage in a bay, and a toAvn called SchitAvar ,9*, just to the westward of the mouth ; here ,93 I conclude the station of the fleet Avas, and here Ave can find a mountain to correspond Avith Okhus. That the town on the main should bear the same title as the island is a circumstance similar to that Avhich takes place at Ormuz, and is founded probably on the practice recorded by Niebuhr, already noticed, of the inhabitants on the coast flying to the islands, in their neighbourhood, or the island receiving its name from a toAvn on the main. This is the second instance, and tAvo more will occur, Avith a third, that possibly may be accounted for upon the same principle. 190 Pearls are now frequently taken at Car rack ; but the depth of water is too great, and the pearls found, though very large, adhere to the shell : two circumstances which will, in my opinion, ever prevent its being a valuable fishery.

The time which the fleet continued here is longer than any interval hitherto employed upon the refitting of the vessels ; and we ought for this reason to suppose that they Availed for the approach of the army, or the collection of the supply.

He did not land here ; but he says it is a pretty large island, and enables us to form a conjecture of its distance from Busheer, by mentionino* that he passed that port between two or three o'clock in the morning and Avas off Coucher at half an hour after seven. I trace an ac count which corresponds Avith this in Niebuhr, Avho upon his arrival at Kormudsch, in his route from Busheer to Schiraz, mentions an arm that runs up from Busheer *46 into the interior 046 Niebuhr, vol. ii. p. 81."], [455, "PERSIS. 393 of the country, then turns itself to the south, and falls again into the gulph lower down towards the east. At the place where this stream ought to fall in, his map presents us Avith Khore-Esseri247, and as Khore signifies a channel, or division, I have little doubt but this is the Heratemis of Arrian, and that Khor-esser 24S is the Koucher of Thevenot. It is true that Nie buhr is not accurate in his account of the arm which comes 249 from Busheer, for there is no such arm, as Mr. Jones assures me, who resided at Busheer many years ; and it is extraordinary that Niebuhr should insert this arm in his oavii draft 2SO, and yet give us Captain Simmons's chart 2SI, in which no river larger than a brook is to be found. As Niebuhr never saAV this Khore- Esseri, therefore all that A\\e can collect is, that he gained intelli gence from inquiry among the natives, that the circumstance of a river inclosing a delta between tAvo of its mouths existed, and that the eastern channel Avas called Khore-Esseri. This, for Avant of further information, he Avas obliged to lay doAvn Avith uncertainty ; but that some stream, attended with these cir cumstances, does fall into the gulph, within the distance of from ten to twenty miles eastward of Busheer, I make little doubt, and such a stream will answer to the Hieratis and Hera temis of Arrian. Mr. Jones is acquainted with a shallow arm of the sea running inland near Hahla: and though he doubts the circumstances here attributed to it, it is not impossible that this arm should send off a channel to the eastAvard.

The town may consist of from 300 to 3^0 houses, most of which are truly miserable.

The town, when I first went to Bassora, enjoyed a great com merce with India, and indeed during the life of Scheik. Nassir ; but since the decease of the old Scheik, and the accession of his son Scheik Nessr, and the extirpation of the Zund family from Scherauae, this commerce has gradually been on the decay.

Bushire, as it is commonly called by the English, is Aboushahr as written by the Persians, and is situated on a point of land washed by an inlet of the sea. A wall, by which the town is fortified on the land side, renders the figure of it an irregular triangle. The present town of Bushire has been created within these thirty years, in consequence prin cipally of the troubles which took place at Scherause on the death of the Vakeel Kerim Khan, aud of the mild, equitable, and inde pendent government of Scheik Nassir. The vessels which frequent this port, provided they are not above 300 tons burthen, may anchor in what is called the inner roads, though even there they are somewhat exposed to the north west ; and as the anchorage ground is not very capacious, and the bar disagreeable, I have 254 Reixel by the Portuguese, who had a fort here.

By their site, the river lS' at Kazeron ought to come to the Avestward of Busheer, and the river at Gra to the eastAvard, but I carry the Kazeron stream to Hieratis, and that of Gra to Taoke or Nuchlat ; and this I am persuaded is their course ; but I dare not assert it in opposition to d'Anville, Niebuhr, and other evidence.

The nature of the country Avill naturally produce tem porary torrents from every valley between the mountains ; but how these are aftenvards combined, and under Avhat name they reach the sea, must be dubious, till travelling shall be more safe and frequent than it is at present. Of the Darabin and Nabon rivers Ave know nothing but their mouths. The Sitakus seems Avell arranged by d'Anville, as the stream that comes from Giouar, and collects all the torrents in the district; but the Kierazin is subject to all the difficulties which have been already stated.

Susiana is sometimes regarded as a district of Persis, and sometimes enumerated as a distinct province. We can hardly trace a time in which it had an independent sovereign of its oavu, unless it be in the mythology of the Greeks 337 ; and nature seems to have connected it with Persis, by a variety of local circum stances, as much as hy vicinity. It is separated on the north from Media by a range of mountains which extend also into Persis, of which the general appellation is Louristan ; possessed in all ages by independent tribes, which were confined Avithin their oavii limits, Avhen the government Avas strong ; and, when it Avas Aveak, returned Avith increased avidity to a life of rapine.

It will be proved hereafter, that Ptolemy reckoned the Dorack channel as the mouth of the Euleus ; and then as he mentions but three [the Tigris, Moseus, and Euleus], the Moseus would regularly be the Karun, and so answer indi vidually to Khore Moosa ; a proof of this is, that his Oroatis, or A'rosis, succeeds next to his Euleus. \u2022 371 See M'Cluer, p. 30. with Dalrymple's query, Mucan or Musan ? and see p. 32. note.

To make Khore Musah exactly correspond with the Moseus of Ptolemy, it must be the issue of the Karun, as it is in M'Cluer's chart. The Orientals write Mousa, pronounced Moosa, for Moses ; the Greeks wrote Mojvo-bc, Moouses, and in this form we easily find the Moseus of Ptolemy. Musah, or Musa, is pronounced, as we should ut ter Moosa, and not Musa, or Muse.

I mention this place for tAvo reasons ; first, because Alexander is said to be the original occupier of this site ; and, secondly, because Cellarius is at a loss, and d'Anville is not Avithout his doubts ; but before I enter into this question, I must digest the course and order of the channels. The Shat-el-Arab Avould naturally have but tAvo, Avhich are the tAvo western ones, the Cossisa-Bony and the Bamishere. The Bamishere Avas a channel frequently navigated by the country vessels till within these feAv years ; Avhen it Avas obstructed by an Arab Sheik, with a vieAv of drowning the country on the Cossisa-Bony ; but operated contrary to his expectation, in clearing that channel, and removing the sands at its mouth. This attempt Avas made by the Chaub Sheik, and Avas knoAvn to Mr. Jones when resi dent at Basra. It is recorded by Niebuhr as happening to the Khore Sable 37s, which is perhaps his name for the Bami shere, or his mistake of the Khore. The five western channels seem to derive their origin from the Euleus, or river of Susa ; this stream divides in the interior of the province ; at what point is difficult to determine : but I can discoA-er clearly, that on approaching the Delta the western branch takes its title from Karun, a toAvn ten or tAvelve miles above the Delta, as the eastern channel does from Deurak, Dorak, or Deree, another inland toAvn, that extends the in fluence of its name down to the coast. The Avestern branch, upon its approach to the Delta, subdivides into four ; the first carries its name of Karun through the Delta to the sea. This was the channel navigated by the country vessels in Thevenot's 375 Sable seems an European term, and French. 3 1 \u2022"], [488, "426 GULPH OF PERSIA. time, from Bender-Regh to Basra ; and the three others are the Selege, the Mohilla, and the Gaban. The Dorack stream of the Euleus, after separating inland, comes to the east, and, as it touches the Delta, joins on one side Avith the Gaban river, and Avith another arm, Avhich Ave may call a sixth channel, encircles an island named Deree, from this Deree, or Dorack stream ; and there is a tract within land styled Dorac-Stan, or Dorghes tan, from the same origin. Noav it is remarkable that Ptolemy notices a Dera inland, Avhich Cellarius knows not hoAV to fix ; Avherever it is, it gives a title to this river, as Kar&n does to the Avestern branch ; it communicates its name also to Deree, the island, Avhere avc are to look for the Kata-Derbis of Arrian, which d'Anville has mistaken ; and in Dorghestan I find the Margastan of Arrian, Avhich he calls an island at Kata-Derbis. The Dorack376 river is no very considerable stream, and accord ing to Mr. Dalrymple's chart, dry at Ioav Avater ; it was probably of more importance formerly, either by natural or artificial means, when the navigation of the province Avas the object of government. Between the mouth of this channel and the Khore Wastah there is a shoal, corresponding Avith the Meidan Ala, called Carabah, or broken 3\" ground, because the soundings vary in an instant. The native pilots say, there is a toAvn sunk under water here, and that the lead is sometimes dropt upon the tops of houses, and sometimes into the streets, which makes the dif ference so immediate. This is a circumstance connected Avith the passage of Nearchus, either through or over this shoal, as will be noticed in its proper place. And again to the eastAvard 3,6 The Dorac stream was injured by the I have since had reason to doubt whether the Chaub Shaik, when he was besieged at Dorac, Dorack stream comes from the Euleus. in the year 1767 (I believe), by the conjoined 377 Mr. Jones. forces of theTurks and English.

The extent of all these shoals naturally obliges vessels to be careful Iioav they approach the coast, and the ground of the Delta being proportionally Ioav and level, is rarely visible except by the rushes which grow upon it. When Thevenot Avent up the Karun, he compares the country to Holland ; and a Holland it would be, Avith industry and a good government ; for a soil, Avhich is the accumulation of slime, ought naturally to be fertile.

Within these few years, it Avas possessed 3\" by the Arab tribe of Kaab 3So, under a Sheik called Soleiman ; he seems to have bettered the cultivation, and, by the possession of a piratical fleet, to have rendered himself for midable to the Turkish government of Basra on the one hand, and to the Vakeel of Shiraz on the other381.

This canal is older than the time of Alexander, for Nearchus mentions that part of the fleet passed through it into the Tigris, Avhen Alexander came doAvn the Euleus to the sea. I shall treat more of this hereafter ; but I must remark at present, that inland navigation is the charac teristic of the province ; and that neither Cellarius or d'Anville has sufficiently attended to this object. Cellarius, avIio alloAvs that the Moseus of Ptolemy must be betAveen the Tigris and Euleus 3S3, cannot comprehend how this canal of Haffar could pass between these tAvo rivers, Avithout exhausting itself into the Moseus ; but he might now see, by a glance at Mr. Dal rymple's chart, that avc have *'u a Tigris 39s and Euleus 3SS, Avith the Moseus 38? betAveen them, and the Haffar canal passing at (he head of the Delta from the Tigris to the Euleus.

Upon considering this opinion, I am induced to think that Mr. d'Anville is misled by Ptolemy's Sinus Mesanius; 3-3 Et quia Mos\u00e6us intervenit Tigrim et Eul\u00e6um, ostium quoque ejus, si in mari est, ut tradit Ptolem\u00e6us, propius utique ad Tigrim accedit, quam Eul\u00e6i.

D'Anville's Mesene is the Gezirat Khader of Thevenot, the Dauasir of Niebuhr, lying betAveen the Shat-el-Arab and the Khore Abdillah ; but Ptolemy's Sinus Mesanius is certainly not the coast of this tract; for his two mouths of the Tigris are manifestly the Shat-el-Arab and the Khore Abdillah, as ap- pears by his placing Teredon betAveen them ; and his Sinus Me- s&nius as manifestly commences not between them, but at the mouth of the Khore, and extends doAvn the Avestern side of the gulph. On looking doAvn the gulph in this direction, I find the bay of Grane 3\", Avith three islands at the entrance ; one of these nearest the shore is called Muchan or Mucan ; this, I appre- hend, gives name to the Sinus Mesanius ; and when I look into Ptolemy for the termination of this on the north, I find the longitude assigned to it is 79\u00b0, specifically the same as his Avestern mouth ofthe Tigris, that is, the Khore Abdillah. Thus Mercator interprets the text, and thus the longitudes and latitudes appear in Ptolemy : Long. Lat. P. 144. Sinus Mesanius 39\u00b0, - c79\u00b0 0' \u2014 30\u00b0 10' P. 154.

This passage proves that the fort is in Me sene, and that the Mesene is betAveen the mouths of the Tigris ; that is, betAveen the Tigris357 and the Moseus.

The just estimation of Mr. d'Anville's name has led me into this discussion. I have iioav done Avith the Tigris and the Delta, and proceed to the Euphrates. KHORE ABDILLAH, SUPPOSED MOUTH OF THE EUPHRATES. The Euphrates appears ahvays to have formed its principal junction with the Tigris at Gorno, or Khorna; but as, from the most early ages, it sent off canals on both sides, for the pur poses of agriculture or communication, so it has happened that one of these which passed by Old Basra, and fell into the Khore Abdillah, has been mistaken by Pliny and Arrian for the real mouth. Arrian is so persuaded of this, that Avhen Nearchus anchors at Diridotis, or Teredon, in the Khore Abdillah, he calls it anchoring in the Euphrates : and he says in another part 3,6 See the map to his Memoir, and that of the Tigris and Euphrates. I build much upon the modern name of Mucan, and the Khore Moosa, and perhaps it ought always to have been written Mosena, or Moostna, from Mucan, which the Greeks made Mesene, because they had a Messene of their own. It is their practice in a thousand instances. I have, however, found reason to suppose that Mesen signifies an island, or per haps more properly land surrounded by the arms of a river, possibly from the Greek jusc-u, but 1 doubt it.

If such a canal as this existed, it communicated Avith the parent stream at various points ; and such a communication as this, d'Anville has pointed out at Naher Saleh, about five-and-thirty miles above Khorna ; he brings this doAvn parallel to the Shat-el- Arab, gives it another communication 4'\u00b0 Avith that channel, near Basra, and aftenvards conducts it into the Persian Gulph, in the direction of the Khore Abdillah ; this is the stream he con cludes to be the ancient course of the Euphrates, and such it was in the estimation of Pliny, Strabo, and Arrian. D'Anville, with the assistance of Texeira, finds this channel noAv dry, and styles it the 4l1 Choabedeh 4\" ; and this dry channel certainly exists, for Mr. Jones, when resident at Basra, has ridden along it many miles. Khore Abdillah takes its modern title from a name of no little importance in Mahomedan mythology, for Abdillah is the son of Annas4'3, who Avas porter to the prophet himself; his tomb is in the neighbourhood of Zobeir, and this Khore is a Crissean Gulph 4M for such votaries as come to pay their devo tions to his relicks.

Where it left the Euphrates above, Avhether at Nahar Saleh, as d'Anville supposes, or Avhether it was a continuation of the grand canal Niebuhr describes, is a problem still to be resolved. I am myself persuaded that it was a canal, and not the natural course ofthe river; for though Nahar** does signify a river, its sense in this country is usually restrained to works of art ; thus the great canal is distinguished, Avhich joined the Euphrates and Tigris in Mesopotamia, called Nah'r Malcha, the Royal Canal ; and a great number of others which branch out of the Euphrates on both sides. To what degree this stream Avas choked in the age of Pliny or Arrian, is not easy to ascertain ; it might only have ceased to be navigable ; for that it continued to convey water to Old Basra, as late as the beginning of the Mahomedan era, is evident ; as that place Avas still inhabited, and still a city. When the supply failed, the desert Avas no longer habit able, and another Basra rose on the banks of the Shat-el-Arab, the foundation of this new city is attributed to Omar423, the 4\" I say usually restrained ; because Nahar is applied to the Euphrates itself, in Joshua, i. 4. and Gen. xv. 18. \" Nahr is never made use of to signify a \" river, i. e. a natural river, either in Arabic \" or Persian, but implies a work of art, from \u00ab\u2022 the canal of Zobeir to the ditches by which \" the fields are watered at Bassora.\" Mr. H. Jones. In modern usage, I conclude Mr. Jones is perfectly correct. Basra was on the eastern side of the Shat-el- Arab, and supposes that he saw the ruins of that city so situated, as he wtnt up that river ; but if such ruihs there are, they ought to be nearly on the site of the fort of Spasinus, the city of Athambilus. I should not venture to controvert his opinion, if I had not consulted the authorities to which he refers.

Nearchus, according to the journal, anchored at Diridotis in the mouth of the Euphrates, the 426 Teredon 4*7 of other authors ; that is, at the entrance of the Khore Abdillah, Avhich they con sider as the Euphrates. Erom hence he returned back, across a lake toAvards the Pasitigris. The length of this lake is thirty-seven miles, according to d'Anville ; but this will be considered here after. I now observe that the Dauasir must be curtailed, or at least carried back so far as to give the Avaters the appearance of a lake rather than a river ; and for this defalcation avc shall find abundant evidence in the account of later Avriters. These proofs evident that Ali was marching from the west, and had rot crossed any river, much less such an one as the Shat-tl-Arab. The battle was fought near Old Basra, for Ayesha was con veyed a prisoner thither the same night ; and that Old Basra was to the westward of the Shat-el-Arab is manifest from the tomb of Zobeir, which is at Gibbel Senam, still visited and revera-nced by the Mahomtdans, and nearly in 'the position of Old Basra.- See Abil-feda, Rtiske, Leipsick ed. 17J4, p. 86. *m There are two courses of reckoning ; by one it would be the fourteenth, by the other the nineteenth.

The name given to the Tigris by Oriental writers is Dejela428, Avhich Bochart informs us they Avould Avrite almost, indifferently Degel, or Deger : hence sprung the Greek Teger or Tigris 42', by their usual assimilation of sound to sense ; and under this title Ave must consider it, in opposition to the Pasitigris, which is a stream perfectly distinct. It is true that Pliny is mistaken on this point, for he supposes that the Tigris in the lower part of its course receives all the Avaters of Susiana, and from thence acquires the name of Pasi-Tigris ; but this is interpreting an Oriental appellation by a Greek etymology. This error was common to other authors, and is expressly corrected by Strabo430; but it has misled so great a geographer as M. d'An ville, Avho brings Nearchus up the Shat-el-Arab, and thence by the Haffar canal to Susa, Avithout considering that Nearchus himself, who returned by this passage from Susa, states the dis tinction in precise terms. The Tigris, in fact, though it communicates with all the rivers of Susiana, cannot be said properly to receive them, for the communications are artificial. Of these there are three : the loAvest is the Haffar43' canal, about tAventy-seven miles beloAv '-' DidsjilO.

The second is named the Suab433 or Soweib ri\\rer, Avhich comes into the Tigris from the east, a little above Basra ; it is connected Avith the rivers of Susiana by means of a canal called the Mesercan434, and this is the usual channel of intercourse between Basra and HaA*iza43S, or Ahwaz : its issue into the Tigris is, according to Ebn Haukal, nearly opposite to Ableh 436, and Ableh is the Aphle of Pliny, perhaps also the Ampe 4\" of Herodotus. The third communication joins the Tigris above Khorna ; it is con nected Avith the streams of Susiana by a cut from the Mesercan, and at this issue the river of Khorremabad, called the Gunedhi by d'Anville, the Gyndes of Herodotus is supposed to join the Tigris ; and by means of the Tigris the intercourse is open up to Vasit or Wasith, and thence to Bagdat.

This system has great difficulties, for the Gyndes 43* Avas crossed by Cyrus in his march to Baby lon ; but if he came from Ecbatana, it Avas not necessary to cross the Diala 439 ; and if from Susa, it Avas an hundred miles out of his way, Herodotus has three rivers distinguished by the name of Tigris : the main stream is that Avhich passes by Opis **\", and is properly the Armenian river ; he has then tAvo 441 others, which come from the country of the Matieni, which is the northern part of Media, the Al Gebal of the Arabs, the Khooestan *\u2022* of 4J' The reason assigned for dividing the Gyndes into 360 channels by Cyrus is not satisfactory.

Neither the river of Khor remabad or the Diala seem to require any such ex pence of time or labour.

Major Rennell supposes the second and third streams to be the great and little Zab, and thus makes the Diala, as the fourth, become the Gyndes. In this it is to be supposed that the great inducement he has to assume the river of Khorremabad for the Choaspes or Euleus is, that it comes out of Media, for that is a character attributed to the Choaspes by several of the an cients. This, however, Avill be matter of future consideration. Ha\\*ing noAv obtained a general idea of the Tigris, it remains to prove that the Pasitigris is a distinct river ; and this can only be effected by taking a view of the peculiarities of Susiana, Avhich are singular in the extreme. To enable us to execute this task, avc have a variety of assistance from ancient and Oriental geographers, from modern navigators, and from the marches of Alexander, Antigonus, and Timour ; but the failure is in regard to modern travellers, avIio might have connected this various information : for in this country, whether from the dangerous disposition of the natives, or from the failure of cu riosity, or the little prospect of emolument, Ave have had no Bruce to penetrate into the interior ; neither have Ave a right to expect that men should jeopardy their lives for our instruction and amusement, Avithout a probability of return. Erom Mr. Jones, hoAvever, I have learned that there is still a regular com munication betAveen Basra and Tostar; that a fleet of small, vessels proceeds monthly, by means of the Karoon river, up to that city ; that it is still considered as the principal, if not the capital, emporium of the province; and that, hoAvever dan gerous it might be for Christians, Mahomedan traders still find a considerable profit in the commerce. 4"], [505, "SUSIS, OR SUSIANA. 443 In earlier times, when Susa Avas the residence of the Persian nionarchs, and the depositary of their treasures, when the rich ness of the soil and the facility of communication Avere equally lucrative to the merchant, the wealth attracted into this little province, and the treasures accumulated in its capital, Avill hardly appear exaggeration to the mind of such as are conversant in these inquiries. The extent of it, from the mountains Avhich encompass it on the north to the gulph of Persia on the south, can hardly be estimated at much more than an hundred miles ; and the extreme length of it, from Basra on the Tigris to Rhagian on the A'rosis, is probably short of two hundred : but the Avhole of this extent is intersected and Avatered by rivers which issue from the various bosoms of the mountains on the north, all of Avhich are united to the main stream which passes by Tostar ; and this stream is again divided into various chan nels, on its approach to the Delta, till it issues into the gulph of Persia by its seAren mouths. This is a similar circumstance, upon a smaller scale, to that Avhich takes place in the Nile, the Indus, the Ganges, and the Danube ; but several of these rivers in Susiana are deep and navigable before their junction, because the mountains Avhich produce them are lofty, and be cause the country through which they Aoav from the moun tains is, Avith very little exception, one universal level to the sea.

That it Avas east of Susa is proved by the bridge upon it, which Alexander passed upon his return from Persis, and as the point Avhere the fleet under Nearchus joined the Macedonian army ; and east of Susa it. appears, by the retreat of Eumenes and Peucestas, and the march44* of Antigonus to attack them- It is from the same march manifestly the second river east from the Euleus, for Antigonus moved from Susa to the Kopratas. The Kopratas is mentioned as a navigable stream four hundred feet Avide, and said to join the Pasitigris before its confluence with the Euleus. Over this stream he advanced a small body of his forces, which for Avant of embarkations he Avas unable to sup- port. Eumenes profited by this error : he hastened instantly from the Pasitigris to attack the forces that Avere separated; and upon their defeat Antigonus Avas compelled to retreat over the mountains into Media. We have, therefore, ascertained a Pasitigris as the second river east from the Euleus, and this is confirmed by the march of Alexander, Avhen he Avas originally proceeding from Susa to Persis, and Avhen after passing the Pasitigris he moved to the north against the Uxii. The Uxii are the Asciacks of Oriental geography : their position is ascer tained both by the ancients and moderns ; they are on the mountains between the riArer of Ram Hormuz and the Tab, that is, betAveen the Pasitigris and the A'rosis.

This bridge continued to exist, according to the latest account of Oriental geography; it is at Ram Hormuz, and lies on the direct road from Rhagian on the A'rosis to Tostar. The Avhole of this arrangement, hoAvever, must be set aside, if Tostar be not identified Avith Susa. In this there Avould be no difficulty, if Major Rennell45' had not assumed Sus on the Kierke for Susa on the Euleus. The Kierke is one of those mountain streams Avhich falls into the river of Khorremabad ; and as this excellent geographer has converted this stream into the Euleus, much deference is due to his judgment : it is with great hesitation that 1 venture to controvert any assumption of his, but I shall state my reasons for dissent, and leave the de termination to the judgment ofthe reader. The whole of his system rests upon the issue of the Khor- at a little distance from Tostar ; but it is an artificial cut, and did not exist in the age of AntiLronus. the progress of Antigonus, in the following chapter, almost to a certainty proves the con trary. 450 Timour employed three days in moving from Tostar to Ram-Hormuz ; and according to Q^ Curtius, Rex [Alexander] quartis cas tris pervenit ad fluvium, Pasitigrim incol\u00e6 vo cant, oritur in montibus Uxiorum. Alexander in sow days from Susa reached the Pasitigris : a nearer correspondence can hardly be required.

But if Oriental authority has any Aveight, this arrangement cannot be admitted ; for Petis de la Croix informs us that the Khorremabad riATer is carried into the Tigris, and the Basra Map of M. Thevenot affords positive evidence in his favour. This is the authority Avhich d'Anville has folloAved, and a very attentive consideration' of the province, Avith every assistance I could obtain, con vinces me that this is the fact. Otter mentions Kierke as the river of Sus : he says that it comes from the mountains of Ervend 454, or Loristan ; that it is joined by the Dinever453, the Guioulguiou, the Silakhor, and the Khorremabad ; and that all five 45S are carried by one stream into the Shat-el-Arab. On this ground, I do not hesitate to ad vance that all these Avestern rivers have no other communication Avith the eastern but by means of the canals, by the Mesercan, or branches derived from it. Let us next consider the inducements Avhich Major Rennell has to conclude that Sus is Susa. 1. The similarity of name. 2. The legend ofthe prophet Daniel, whose coffin Avas found at Sus. 3. The desire of adopting a river that has its origin in Media. 1. To the first I ansAver that the similarity of name is a cor roborative circumstance, Avhen we are sure of our position ; but 4S4 D'ervend, perhaps AapWw. \u25a0 Otter, ii p. 56. 456 This map was framed by a native of Basra. 455 Perhaps Dainewar."], [510, "448 GULPH OF PERSIA. till the position is ascertained, it is only a presumptive proof, and often fallacious, as may be collected from the many decep tions of this sort which have misled so great a geographer as d'Anville. But if Tostar recedes from, a resemblance of Susa, Shuster approaches it ; and Shuster it is constantly written in Ebn Haukal, and many other Oriental geographers. Shuster again approaches still nearer to Shushan, which is its title in Scripture ; and Shusha differs not from Susa but by the insertion of a dot in the letter Shin. That Daniel Avas at Shushan is indubitable, and that Shushan Avas upon the river Euleus is equally evident ; for the prophet says he Avas at Shushan, Gnal-Aub-al-Ulai 4S7, on the river Ulai ; and Aub-al-Ulai Avould at this day express the same thing in the language of the country. That this Shushan Avas. not Sus, but Shuster, has every apparent evidence in its favour ; for if Sus is a very ancient city, as the Oriental writers alloAV, Shuster is still more ancient. It Avas in their opinion built im mediately after the flood by Houchenk 45' and the mythology of the Greeks makes it as ancient ; for in their estimation it Avas built by Tithonus, son of Memnon. Now it is sufficiently acknoAvledged that, in the idea of the Greeks, whatever is called Mcmnonian, Cyclopean, or Ogygian, is something antecedent to all history ; and in this vieAV the testimony of Greeks and Persians is the same.

A strong reason for placing this Susa at Shuster occurs in Ebn Haukal ; for he informs us460, that there is not in all Khuzistan any mountain or sand except at Sinister, Jondi-Shapour, and Aidej4*1 : but if the treasures of the empire Avere to be guarded in the capital, it must be in a fortress ; and the idea of a fort ress and a mountain is so nearly allied, that Ave cannot suppose this circumstance Avould have been neglected, where so great a mass of wealth Avas to be secured. That Shuster is placed on a hill Ave know, for the Avaters of the Ab Zai are raised by a mound or dyke at Dez Phoul, to supply the city ; and that the citadel of Susa Avas strongly fortified Ave learn from the surrender of it to Alexander, and from the defence of it by Xen6philus against Antigonus 46\\ avIio Avas obliged to decline a siege from the necessity of pursuing the enemy.

This is ra tional, for there is no stone in the province. He adds, that, according to Polycletus, it was 25 miles round, and without walls. This is not inconsistent with a fortified citadel.

Some additional evidence favourable to the arrangement here proposed may be collected from the marches of Alexander, Antigonus, and Timour : they all entered the province ap parently by folloAving the course of the Khorremabad 468 river, by Avhich they avoided the difficult passes in the mountains of Loristan, and came immediately into the plains of Susiana. it with a yellow cast.

It contains one irrefragable proof that the Klior remabad river comes into the Tigris, for it lays down the Kierke expressly as having that direction. Now the Kierke is the river of Sus ; it is to the east of the Khorremabad ; and if the Kierke comes into the Tigris, it can only be by its junction with that river, and that river cannot go to the east itself. 4'7 See Geography of Herodotus, pp. 203. 33P 468 Khorremabad is the principal city of Loristan, the district between Media and Su siana.

All these cir cumstances are appropriate to the Euleus of the ancients, and can be applied to no other river in the province.

The Choaspes and Euleus are allowed to be the same river by most of the modern geographers ; possibly they are two sources of one river. 4,\u00b0 There were secretaries attendant on the army of Timour, who marked his progress day by day. On the completion of his expedi tion, or the success of his arms, the dis patches were made up from these journals, and sent to Samarkand, where they were registered and became archives.

The shoal, hoAvever, seems to be noticed by the expression of Arrian upon the conclusion of the course ; for he says, after a passage of about thirty miles they came to anchor at the mouth of a lake 4\", rather than an harbour *\", Avhere there Avas abundance491 of fish. The place Avas called Kataderbis, and an island Avhich lay at the mouth, Margastana. In these tAvo Avoids there seems an evident allusion to an island still called Deree, and a tract called Dorghestan ; but of the Bender Madjour which d'Anville, from the Turkish Geographer, allots to this station, I find no traces in any English chart. One-and-thirty miles, measured upon M'Cluer's chart, bring Nearchus to an anchor between the tAvo islands Deree and Dereebouna, and one-and-thirty English miles end betAveen Dereebouna and the main. In either position, Nearchus might have but one island in contemplation, and consequently have no cause to mention more. Their modern names are such as they have from the pilots ; but, hoAvever applied, certainly re late to the inland Dera of Ptolemy, which gives name to the eastern channel of the Euleus, evident in Deurak, still existing, 487 The Tenagos Arenosum of Ptolemy is the shoal Barcan in this very position between the Euleus and the A'rosis.

Upon a revieAV of Ptolemy at this place, observing that he mentions the mouth of the Euleus immediately next to the A'rosis, and has the Moseus onty, Avithout noticing the other channels between the Euleus and the Tigris, I am more con firmed in my opinion, that his Moseus is the branch Ave noAV call the Karoon, with Khore Moosa at its issue ; and that the Mesene comprehends, not only the strip betAveen the Cossisa- Bony and Bamishere, but perhaps as far as the Karoon also. The two islands at the mouth of this bay are not accurately named, for Bouna is possibly a channel rather than an island, and seems to correspond in contradistinction to the Cossisa- Bony, either as such, or as a boundary and termination of the Delta. The Oriental geographers place a fort here, called Medhi and Modhi 493, perhaps in the. situation of Moshure, in Mr. Dalrymple's chart ; and it is probable that in the bay, formed by this mouth of the Euleus, d'Anville's Bender Mad jour494 may be discovered; it cannot be Avhere the map of his Memoir places it ; for the coast there is covered with the shoal Barcan, and d'AnA'ille's three495 maps are ail particularly incor- 492 I do not search for an error in the initial letter ; for I believe the change to arise from 6ome Oriental orthography, which I cannot discover. -t94 I do suppose it to be the Mahirooyan of Ebn Haukal; but I cannot ascertain whether he calls the bay by that name, or places it to the east, of the bay.

Now ii is true that a muddy shore, and the staking out a dangerous passage, are not peculiarly characteristic of one coast more than another, for the practice is sufficiently general ; but it is very extraor dinary that this circumstance should be so decidedly noticed on this part of the coast by Arrian, Ptolemy, Pliny, Marcian, AI- 496 And many other passages in different Elephant man of war just launched at Bussle parts of the world.

An attention of this kind is perfectly con sistent Avith the commercial spirit of the province, and proceeds upon the same grounds as the naA7igation inland. A passage over or through the shoal is necessarily implied in the account of the journal ; the accomplishment of it is reconciled to reason by the method I have pursued, and in Avhatever state the coast may iioav be, it can hardly afford a ground of objection to my statement of Avhat it might have been at the distance of so many centuries. Amidst all disadvantages of ancient navigators, they had one advantage arising from the little depth of Avater the con struction of their vessels required. Through a passage, then, of this sort, Nearchus conducted his fleet thirty-seven miles, and then came to an anchor Avithout being able to approach the shore. Here they took their repast on board, and gave the people some time for refreshment. I have no hesitation to fix this anchorage in the Khore Wastah, the issue of the Selege stream s\u00b03, for there the measure given agrees perfectly ivlth M'Cluer, and there lie seems to terminate the Karabah. It is a minute circumstance, but Avorth noticino*, that both Ptolemy and Marcian agree in making the eastern commencement of the bay, Pelodes, at some distance from the Euleus, and their termination of it is at the Moseus, or Karoon, which Avould naturally happen, as they take no notice of the intermediate channel, or Khore Wastah.

I have already mentioned that Ptolemy, places Teredon between the tAvo mouths of the Tigris, Avhich evidently proves that he considered d'Anville's Choabedeh, as a mouth of the Tigris, and not of the Euphrates. And as I have before accounted for Ptolemy's Sinus Mesanius, the whole of ancient geography is thus rendered consistent Avith itself, and Avith our modern charts. It Avill seem extraordinary that, Avhen the course of Nearchus lay up the Tigris, or Shat-el-Arab, he should pass the mouth of that channel, and bring his fleet to an anchor in the Khore Abdillah, which he calls the mouth of the Euphrates. This, according to Pliny's account, Avas just going so much out of his Avay, and causing a necessity of re-measuring his course back again the same distance. Pliny's estimate, computed by d'An ville's method, is reduced to twelve miles and an half; and the real distance, taken largely, may be about ten. If, therefore, it is asked why this happened, the ansAver \"will exhibit one of those minute coincidences which nothing but truth could pro duce. It is a circumstance connected Avith the nature of the navigation, and it continues to be the practice of the pilots to the present hour, for thus M'Cluer describes the course : .....'.** After5\" these soundings in Khore Gufgah, you will \" quickly shoalen to four one-half fathoms, and this the pilot \" calls Mucan s\" ; and from that, three one-half or three fathoms s,s The Mesene. !\" M'Cluer's Memoir, p. 30. 3o"], [528, "GULPH OF PERSIA. 466 \" to Bussorah Bar513.

The reason of this is obvious ; for the projection of the Meidan-Ala throAvs the vessel off the coast till she is opposite to the Khore Abdillah, and the level of the land is so Ioav at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab, that it is much safer for her to make land in the Khore, than to stand up the Shat-el-Arab at once, Avhen the coast on either hand is too Ioav to be Arisible. While Nearchus lay at anchor in this Khore, Avhich he calls the Mouth of the Euphrates, intelligence Avas received that Alexander Avas on his march to Susa. He determined, there fore, to return back 5M ; and then, by pursuing his course up the Pasi-Tigris, to join him in the neighbourhood of the capital. Here it is that, in my endeavour to explain the folloAving day's course, I am obliged to differ totally from d'Anville. I ap peal to the candour of the reader, that no captious love of oppo sition may be imputed to me, for I have too great a deference to that great geographer's opinion, ever to depart from it Avith out sufficient grounds. 513 The bar at the mouth of the Cossisa- Bony, or Shat-el-Arab, as I use it. \u2122 \"EvStv xal \u00abvto\u00bb to OniEst \"tXeov, p. 357."], [529, "SUSIS, OR SUSIANA. 467 In conducting Nearchus from Diridotis to Susa, d'Anville carries him into the Shat-el-Arab, as high as Aginis or Zeine, and thence by the Haffar Canal through the interior of the pro vince up to the bridge, where he met the army and terminated his expedition. Aly reasons for assuming a different course are these : 1st, Pliny's Chaldean Lake, and Arrian's Lake at the mouth of the Tigris, are not the same. 2dly, Arrian's Pasitigris is neArer the Shat-el-Arab, and in this he is supported by Strabo. 3dly, In the passage of Nearchus up the river, no notice is taken of the canal of Haffar, but only upon Alexander's course doAvn to the gulph. 4thly, Nearchus is said to go up the Pasitigris, Alexander is .said to come doAvn the Euleus. 5thly, Nearchus, in his course from Diridotis, sailed with Susiana on his left hand. 1st, THE CHALDEAN LAKE.

His SIS Chaldean Lake, therefore, is not at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab, but inland. This, I conceive, is the first source of d'Anville's mistake ; and Pliny's error in assuming Pasitigris, as the appellation of the Tigris and Eu phrates united in the Shat-el-Arab, is the ground of his making the fleet go up that channel, instead of the real Pasitigris. D'Anville follows him in this assertion, and here is his second mistake. For, 2dly, Arrian's Pasitigris is always that stream Avhich, floAving east of Susa, joins the Euleus at some distance below that capital. I have proved this by the concurrent testimony of Strabo, Diodorus, Q. Curtius, and Cheref-eddin, all according with Arrian. It did not approach the city ; it Avas a broad, deep, and navigable river : it crossed the road from Persis ; and, after its junction Avith the Euleus, the united stream se parated again, sending off one branch eastward, noAv called the Gaban 5\", and another Avestward, which is the Karoon ; and, finally, its characteristic distinction is the title of Pasi, or North Eastern Tigris, in opposition to the great stream of that name, Avhich is now styled the Shat-el-Arab 5'*. This is manifestly the -\"* Susa a Persico mari absunt ccl. m. pass, qua subiit ad earn \\_ea~\\ classis Alexandri Pasitigri.

This, considering the tenor of the journal, is one of the strongest evidences Avhich can be produced ; for an artificial cut Avas no common object to a Greek, and a similar circumstance is preserved at Hera- temis, though the passage was neither explored, or made any part ofthe navigation. An omission, it is true, is only a nega- tive proof, but in an instance of this kind it must have con siderable weight. Q 4thly, There is no inconsistence in mentioning Alexander's descent by the Euleus, and Nearchus's ascent by the Pasitigris, for Nearchus entered that river from the Euleus, Avhere it bore this appellation in contradistinction to the Tigris, and Alexander embarked at Susa, Avhere that source, Avhich passes the capital, is called the Euleus.

It is thus that the Euleus and Choaspes are transmutable, and thus that the Pasi tigris is confounded Avith the Tigris and the Euleus. If Alex ander embarked at Susa, the stream Avas necessarily the Euleus, and this name Avas continued to the sea. If Nearchus entered the Pasitigris, it Avas at the confluence ,of that river with the Euleus. By the latter he Avould have reached Susa, by the former he effected his junction Avith the army. Add to this, that in the ascent of Nearchus, Arrian takes his account from the journal of the commander himself; in the descent of Alex ander, he follows Ptolemy and Anistobulus. In the history, the Pasitigris is not mentioned ; in the journal, no notice is taken of the Euleus SI* : the reason is plain, Alexander on his descent did not enter the Pasitigris at all. 5thly, The expression of Arrian is precise, when he asserts that Nearchus sailed back again from Diridotis ; but it is not equally apposite, if he returned only to the Shat-el-Arab. It appeal's evident that he had intended to go up that channel by the course he held, but that the account he received at Diridotis informed him that the king Avas directing his course to Susa ; this intelligence carried him back to the Pasitigris, as the readiest way to join the army ; wdiile the navigation up the Shat-el-Arab and through the Haffar canal was either unknown to him at that time, or not in his contemplation. But this is not all ; he passed on his return from Diridotis Avith Susiana on his left. Could this be true, if he had sailed up the Shat-el- Arab ? Let any advocate of Mr. d'Anville inform me, if ever the w It is meant to assert this only, that in History, lib. vii. p. 282. with the Indica, -the journal the Euleus is never once mentioned p. 357. as the river Nearchus sailed up.

Whether it Avas possible for Arrian to terminate that province Avest, at the Euphr4tes 5\" in stead of the Tigris ? No. It Avas always styled Arabia, by the concurrent testimony of historians and geographers, as it is to the present day, and it Avas ahvays possessed by Arabs, whose fnfluence reaches to the very Avails of Basra. If, hoAvever, it can be supposed that Nearchus made his s\" Euphrates the boundary of Susiana, the difficulty Avill be in creased ; for then, in sailing up the Shat-el-Arab, the expres sion ought to have been, that he proceeded up the Shat-el-Arab through Susiana, not Avith Susiana on his left ; for, if the Tigris is the boundary, in going up it, Susiana must be on the ri\u00b0;ht. o The Avhole of this error originates s23 Avith Pliny ; he knew, from the historians of Alexander, that the fleet Avent up the Pasitigris ; but his Pasitigris is the Shat-el-Arab, and theirs is the river connected Avith the Euleus.

Niebuhr makes it thirty miles up to Hasseinad ; but Mr. Jones \"9, avIio has passed frequently up the channel and down, seems to think, that the Avestern bank is every Avhere too high to admit of inundation, till within eight or ten miles of the mouth ; but that part, he says, has undoubtedly been under water, and thus does the testimony of a living witness confirm our Avritten evidence. I am noAv, in conformity Avith the correction of Schmeider, to conclude that Nearchus has described this lake Avithout entering it ; and that though he has stated that it is only five hundred stadia from Aginis to Susa, he did not pursue this course, but preferred a much more circuitous one, by retracing his passage across the shoals, and returning to the Euleus. In assuming this line of navigation, I must likeAvise revoke an arrangement of my OAvn, in Avhich I conducted Nearchus by the Khore Moosa into the Karoon, and by the Karoon up to the Pasitigris..

Let us next conduct him across the Kara bah, Avith the same caution he had adopted in his former pas sage. During all this course, Susiana, that is, the Ioav land of the Delta, continues on his left hand, and he hoav reaches the bay into which the Euleus issues by the channel called Gaban in the modern charts. This bay lies betAveen the two shoals of Karabah and Barcan, and at the western point, Avhere it terminates on the gulph, avc may compute fourteen hundred stadia from Diriddtis, taking off one hundred S4S for the breadth of the bay to Kataderbis; and from this point, if avc suppose Nearchus to have turned nortlnvard directly for the Gaban channel, Ave must conclude that he reckoned six hundred stadia more from the same point up to the mouth of the Pasitigris ; that is, the junction of that stream Avith the Euleus. This, indeed, is but forty Roman miles, and seems an estimate much too short to carry us to the confluence ; but it is demonstrable that Arrian makes out his computation of two thousand stadia by this method, for his language Avill admit of no other construction. \" The length S49 \" of the course along the coast of Susiana [from Diridotis] to \" the mouth of the Pasitigris is tAvo thousand stadia.\" These are his express Avords, and they admit of no remedy, unless avc have made the estimate of his track from Diridotis to the bay too long ; and then all that Ave take off from that may be added to his passage up the river.

There arc no data, indeed, for fixing the point of confluence Avhere the Pasitigris joins the Euleus ; but the confluence itself is certain, for it has been shewn already that all the rivers of Susiana communicate Avith the Euleus, and all the streams on the east of that river fall into it, and have one common issue in this bay near Hisn Modhi; It is this reason more especially Avhich induces me to conclude that Nearchus Avent up this bay and this channel, in preference to any of those Avhich cross the Delta, for this is the Euleus or main stream of Ptolemy ; and that Arrian considered it in the same light Ave seem to have proof, Avhen he brings doAvn Alex ander with the fleet from Susa ; for he there informs us, that the course Avas doAvn the Euleus to the Delta ; that at the Delta Alexander sent off all the vessels that Avere unfit for service, by a canal (that is the Haffar) into the Tigris ; and that he pro ceeded himself with the remainder doAvn the Euleus to the sea.

Pliny had evidently found the same number of stadia, but doubled the distance by using the Olympian stadium in his re duction. Mr. Dalrymple's chart by Mr. HoAve exceeds in reality all but Ptolemy ; and it is a great disappointment to find that a chart, upon Avhich depends the best information for elu cidating Arrian, should be so defectiA e in its measurement.

In order to effect this junction, Nearchus proceeded from the bay up the Gaban channel to the Pasitigris, through a country rich and populous ; and then, an hundred and fifty stadia or fifteen miles up that river to a village, where he found an ample supply for his fleet, not only of necessaries, but of every thing that could minister to the conveniency and luxury of life. Here he offered sacrifices for the preservation of the fleet and the success of his expedition. The usual games attended this ceremony, and the festivity natural to plenty and security succeeded to the fatigues of the voyage. Nothing is mentioned in the text which may induce us to suppose that Nearchus had any thing farther in ?iew than Avait ing for intelligence of the army ; but he is in a position from Avhence he might have gone up either the Euleus or the Pasitigris, Avith almost equal facility, according to the account he might receive.

I ought not to knoAv more than my director, and he says, that Hephestion was ordered to take this route because it was winter, and the winter was milder on the coast than inland. This is too true, .for the mildness extends to heat, putridity, and unwholesomeness. It appears to me that Arrian has not preserved the real cause of this order, for Alex ander seems to have acted upon this occasion, as upon ail others, from the time he had no more enemies to subdue ; that is, because he was desirous of obtaining a knowledge of his empire ; and he detached Hephestion through the Kermesir for the same reason he had ordered Craterus to proceed through Arachosia from the Indus, and Nearchus to survey the coast.

With due allowance for this natural obscurity, I submit the Avhole to the judgment of the reader, and shall conduct the army, once more united, to the Pasitigris, and to a bridge on that river Avhere Nearchus is to conclude his ex pedition.

The eastern entrance of it is guarded by a fort, with two others at its issue into the Tigris.

Alexander, after dispatching the greater part of his fleet by this passage, proceeded Avith the lightest and best sailing vessels doAvn the Euleus to the bay at Kataderbis, and hence round the Delta to the mouth of the Tigris or Shat-el-Arab. But of this passage Ave have no distinct account, except the mention of that intervening space on the Gulph of Persia Avhich Nearchus had navigated twice before. The narrative, in fact, is so brief, that it employs only four lines to conduct him into the Tigris, to convey him up to the camp of Hephestion, and from the camp to Opis, Avhere the expedition closes. 8 ai $1 aXXai dvr__ i\u00bb\u00a3{ dto_xou.trr^f_irrat xara, tov 'EvXdtot tr iPt AlstPYXA H TETMHTAI ex rS Tiy^nrot Ii rot EvXxum, rdvry ditxofu^ria'a.t It rot TtygriTot. country was like Soleyman Sheik of the Kiab in modern times.

If Alexander, then, had fixed upon Babylon for the future capital of his empire, (and here the sovereigns of the East ever ought to have fixed, if they had not rather wished to shrink from their European frontier, than to maintain it,) the first step necessary was to restore the country round it to the state it had enjoyed in its primitive splendour under the Babylonian mo narchy.

Usher agrees with Petavius in supposing that Desius originally ansAvered to Heeatombeon, and aftenvards to Thargelion ; but in his Ephemeris91 he assigns the 1st of Desius to the 25th of April : the 28th of Desius consequently corresponds with the 22d of May ; and, as his date of Alexander's accession is Sep- tember 24th, it folloAvs of course that his reign Avas tAvelve years complete on that day, in the year 324 A.

By measuring off sixty Roman miles on d'Anville's map we arrive at Bagdat ; consequently it is plain that he intended to fix the passage and the bridge of boats at the site of that city, where it continues to the present hour. If, however, d'Anville should be mistaken (which is hardly pro bable), the means of correcting his error are easy. Many of our English gentlemen, Jn going to, or returning from India, prefer the route by Hilleh, B?gdat, and Mosul, to the passage over the great desert between Ba ra and Aleppo.

By these considerations the eastern sids of the Tigris is cleared of its difficulties ; and if it were possible to reduce the movements of the army to a consistence with this account, it would be as easy to lay down the distance on the western as on the eastern side of the Tigris. But I am not .ible to reconcile Xenophon to himself, so as to make his detail of the marches correspond with the local circumstances he has recorded : for, in the first place, he informs us, that two days previous to the battle, they were distant only thirty-six I0 miles from the Median wall ; and, upon another occasion, he as serts that it was only twenty-six miles from the Median wall to the bridge over the Tigris. The first of these distances agrees precisely with the measure to the wall of Semiramis ; but from that wall to the bridge, taken from the nearest point, it is up wards of sixty miles. These circumstances are perfectly irreconcileable with each other, or with truth. Again, we are told that the Median wall is sixty miles long. This is true in regard to the wall of Semiramis, for Strabo makes its eastern termina tion at Opis, and Julian passed its western limit at Macepracta : this distance mea sures sixty miles with precision ; but if for this reason we should suppose them both to be the same, the difficulty still recurs of reconciling the difference between twenty six miles and sixty. Let us take this in another point of view. It has been proved already, from the march of the Greeks on the eastern side of the Tigris, that it was sixty miles from the bridge to the Phuskus and Opis ; but if the termination of the wall on the western side is opposite to Opis, and we suppose the Greek army to have passed the wall at, that point, twenty-six miles in this direction south v/ould not carry them to the bridge by thirty-four ; and if they did not cross the wall at this point (which they certainly did not), the deficiency increases in proportion to the obliquity of the line they followed. It is next to be observed tbrt Shake, a city within two miles of the bridge, is men tioned (as far as I have learned) by no other author except Xenophon \" ; and it is 10 riapETETaTO Js i r\u00a3.fpo< atu Jia rS irioiu \\w S..-UC- -rapaadyyat, i___xpt r3 M\u00bb&a; Tt&ouf.

This is singular, but it does not justify the supposition of an error in the name \u2022, for it is to be presumed that every officer must know the name of the place in which he is quartered ; but it is introduced to shew that if there is an error in the position, no ancient authority is extant by which it can be corrected. The site which d'Anville assigns to it is very nearly the ground occupied by old Bagdat, west of the Tigris ; and this he is fully justified in deducing from the sixty miles between the bridge and the Phuskus. Here, then, is a third instance of the difference be tween the twenty-six and sixty miles, for which no solution appears. But it is very remarkable that at the point where the two rivers approach nearest to each other, the interval is given in a variety of maps with no greater fluctuation than the difference between twenty-four '.* and twenty-six miles ; and this may in duce a persuasion that the Greeks passed a wall close to the Euphrates, and then con tinued along it within side, till it directed them to Shake. I cannot demonstrate this *, but the remains n of a wall in this direction, with the ruins of buildings, are seen by every traveller who coines by land from Hilleh to Bagdat : they are noticed by Tavernier and Ives, and represented with great attention in Delisle's map. De lisle ,4, indeed, gives it an extent of near seventy miles, in which he makes it ap proach to the length of the Median wall, as stated by Xenophon ; and he carries the western termination of it to Babylon. This is not conformable to my own conception, but is an evidence that Delkle found another wall besides that of Semiramis. D'An- ation, but that it is near the Tigris.

See Ives, p. 297. Tavernier, torn. i. p. 238. Amsterdam ed. 12 Strabo gives this distance at 200 stadia, or 25 miles, lib. ii. p. 80 ; and d'Anville places the narrowest part between Bagdat and Ros waina, with an interval of 27 Ronan miles. 13 Ives went to visit Nimrod's tower, which lies west by north about nine miles from Bag dat. \" We passed the Tigris by the bridge \" of boats, and rode through old Bagdat ; \" from whence, quite up to the tower, ruins \" of buildups, either wholly above or some \" what under ground, are still to be seen, \" which can be no other than the remains of the \" ancient Seleucia.\" This is perfect evidence for the ruins, perhaps for a wall also. But it is very strange that Ives, who had visited Al-Mjdain, should not know that Seleucia '\u25a0* I was favoured with Delisle's map by Mr. Jacob Bryant, which gives this wall and ruins in a very conspicuous manner. What they are, whether the extension of old Bagdat, or the remains of Shake, or of a wall built by Zobeida, wife of Haroun Al Raschid, which extended across the desert to Mecca, is difficult to say. See Abd-ul- Khurreem, p. 129. But if I could make the movements of the ten thousand previous to the wall correspond, I should say this was the Median wall, and two days march within it would tally with the in terval between the Euphrates and the Tigris in this part. See Gasparo Balbi. Purchas. vol. iii. p. 1723."], [601, "ON THE SITE OF OPIS. 537 ville once seems to have been of the same opinion ; for, in a map drawn up for Rollin's Ancient History, he brings a second wall in a curve from the centre of that of Semiramis, and conducts it to the Euphrates, very nearly at the point where the movements of the army require it. If this is no proof that such a wall exists, it im plies at least that d'Anville could not reconcile the facts recorded in history without such a supposition. After all, Xenophon himself informs us that the Median wall was not l5 far from Babylon ; and this expression, though indefinite, does not tally with the position of the wall of Semiramis, which measures in a right line an hundred and twenty-five miles from that capital. I should consider this as conclusive evidence in favour of a second wall, if it were not connected with another estimate of Xenophon's, which states that it was three hundred and six miles from the field of Kunaxa to Babylon. This will not be found correspondent to truth in any map. On d'Anville's it measures only one hundred and forty ; and with the allowance of a sixth for road distance, it cannot extend to much more than an hundred and sixty. Xenopho'n, indeed, did not march over this interval, and therefore must have taken his estimatefrom report. Of the movements of his own army, however, he could not be ignorant : these I shall now give in detail ; and if no satisfactory solution should be obtained of the various difficulties which have been stated, I shall at least furnish facts for abler geographers to form calculations on, which may lead to the discovery of truth. Let us then assume, with d'Anville, that the field of Kunaxa was eighteen miles from the wall of Semiramis, and let us commence our inquiry from the position of the Greek army on this field the day after the battle. Their first movement was retro grade, to join Arieus, who was now in the camp which Cyrus had left on the morning of the preceding day. The Greeks commenced their march in the evening, and joined Arieus at midnight : the distance may be estimated at three ,6 parasangs, or nine 15 The wall, according to Xenophon, was built of baked bricks laid in bitumen, 20 feet broad, too high, and 20 parasangs in length, dirilx1 B*\u00a3\"*Zw>s a iroXv, and was not far from Babylon.

Leunclav. extent to the two following days, as he pro ceeded negligently, and was taken unprepared on the dav the battle was fought, just before he was going to encamp for the night ; conse quently the Greeks had only three parasangs to return in order to join Arieus. Xenophon, however, says in another place, lib. i. 269. that it was four ; but this is an estimate from report, r'trrapit 01 'EAEsONTO irapaadyyat Ps oKu iiHH. A difference of two or three mile3 does not greatly interfere with my calculation ; and it is to be remarked, that the whole length 16 Two days previous to the battle, Cyru3 marched only three parasangs or nine miles, with his army in battalia ; and I give the same 3 z"], [602, "ON THE SITE OF OPIS. 538 miles, and the interval between the army and the wall may be increased to twenty seven. Upon consulting with Arieus the following day, it was deemed impossible to return through the desert *, they determined, therefore, to proceed towards the north, in order to find the supplies necessary for the army ; and to make long marches, that they might increase their distance from the king. They did march to the north, for it is expressly noticed that they moved with the sun I7 on their right ; and a long march would amount to five or six parasangs, say eighteen miles. This course, as the country lies ,s, would not enlarge their distance from the wall ; but let us estimate it at thirty miles. This is of importance, for it is the point farthest north which they reached, as on the day following they treated with heralds sent from the king, and were conducted to villages where their wants were relieved. This movement must be either towards the east or the south, most probably the latter, as they seem, from the circumstances which follow, to tend towards the wall ; and if we estimate the march at three '9 parasangs, they were now from twenty to five-and-twenty miles distant, according as we give a direction to their route. At these villages they remained three dap, when Tissaphernes arrived from the king, who, after amusing them for three days more, at last came to an agreement, that he would himself conduct them home, and furnish them with proper supplies on their march. With these delusions be detained them twenty days more, during which interval he corrupted Arieus with hopes of pardon, and finally detached him so com pletely from the Greeks, that when the different armies were again set in motion, Arieus joined the king's forces on the march, and encamped with them m the evening. Upon the commencement of the march again, both armies proceeded for three days, and their direction must have been southward, for at the termination of that period they reached the wall ; and if we calculate their progress at three *-* parasangs of the march from Thapsacus to Kunaxa ex ceeds the real distance in the proportion of 196 parasangs to 140, including the road dis tance. of the king's army, as described by Xenophon. I know not what authority d'Anville has for this curve, but it is probably founded on good information ; and if it is correct, the Greek army is nearer the wall, after proceeding 18 miles north-east, than when they left their camp in the morning. '9 Four parasangs each are attributed to the two days' march within the wall. I do not wish to accommodate distances, but an error on the side of moderation is better than one in excess : perhaps they always marched less than their calculation. - 17 it ot%ty_ 7x\u00b0trtt rot r.Xtot, p. 277* In the morning this would make their course north ; and as the sun advanced towards the south, their progress would take an inclination to the east : and this we may suppose would coincide with the intention of Arieus to conduct them towards the. Tigris. *'' D'Anville's map makes Kunaxa lie near Hit in a sinuosity of the Euphrates, which docs not very well accord with the approach"], [603, "ON THE SITE OF OPIS. 539 a-day, the interval corresponds within two miles, with the distance already supposed, that is, it would amount to twenty-seven miles, instead of twenty-five. This must, therefore, be the wall of Semiramis, for it will not agree with the supposition of any interior fortification whatsoever. Here, then, the same difficulty recurs*, for let them pass the wall at any given point, it could not be less than sixty miles to the bridge, and might be much more. How is this to be reconciled with the declaration in express terms, that from the wall to Shake they marched eight parasangs in two days, and that Shake was fifteen stadia from the Tigris and the bridge ? This difficulty will not be relieved by giving a more northerly position to Shake than that which d'Anville has assumed ; for then the distance from Sitake to the Phus kus, on the eastern side of the Tigris, must be curtailed in the same proportion : con tradicting directly another express declaration of the text, that it was twenty2\" parasangs, or sixty miles, from the bridge to that river. This assertion is so positive, that it removes all doubt in regard to the position of Opis -, and if I am not able to arrange the distances on the western side of the Tigris, I at least state the question fairly, and leave it open for the discussion of those who have better means of informa tion than myself. At Opis contrivances were invented to keep the Greeks in alarm, and induce them to pass the river, as Xenophon supposes, lest they should take post in the country, and, by encircling themselves with the canals as the means of defence, occupy a station from whence they might molest the districts in the neighbourhood. A different reason is more obvious : for Tissaphernes had manifestly a design of placing two navigable rivers between them and Greece, instead of one ; and as he was meditating the de struction of their commanders from the beginning (which he afterwards effected), he concluded that the obstructions afforded by two such rivers ensured the annihilation of the whole army. Neither did he want a pretence for this protraction of their route, which is apparently in direct opposition to their return. The country through which he proposed to conduct them affords the means of support, while the course by which they had advanced from Thapsacus, or the passage over the great desert, would be represented as impracticable. It was this consideration which induced both Antony and Julian to attempt their retreat, by tending to the north ; and modern travellers, who Avish to avoid the desert, generally go up from Bagdat as high as Mosul, or higher, before they take a westerly direction across Mesopotamia to Aleppo. \u00bb Xen. Anab. p. 284. 3Z 2"], [604, "54o ON THE SITE OF OPIS. These transactions, indeed, are foreign to the subject of our inquiry ; but as they are connected with Opis, and the treachery of Tissaphernes took effect at the river next in order to the Phuskus, the digression may be pardoned, if it throws light on historical facts misrepresented by some, and by others not understood. If we have ascertained, however, the situation of Opis, by the confluence of the Phuskus, or by any combination of circumstances whatsoever, nothing remains but to shew that Herodotus has not two different Opis's, but one only, and that in the position here assigned. Having been led into an error myself on this subject, in the former edition, I am happy to have had the means of correction suggested to me on the present occasion ; and equally ready shall I be to embrace any probable solution of the fresh difficulties which I have stated in this disquisition. The question relative to the Opis of Herodotus may be set at rest by the following considerations. Herodotus notices three il rivers, to which he gives the name of Tigris : the principal stream he derives from Armenia, and the two inferior rivers from Matiene, which answers to the northern or mountainous part of Media*53 ; to these he adds a fourth, which he calls the Gundes. Now it does not interfere with the present inquiry, whether we suppose, with Major Rennell, the two Zabs to be the two inferior Tigris's, and the Diala to be the Gundes ; or whether we embrace the opinion of M. d'Anville 33, who assumes the greater Zab and the Diala J4 for the two Tigris's, and the river of Khor- 21 TloTa/xoi ot triva\\ irtpnrol riaatpi. 6ta ravrr,_ pryTi .... irpuroc fj.it -^iyprit, fj-tra at otvrtpot rt xa\\ rptro. wy-ros _..ajj.x^ofj-itot' ovx uvrot tut izora fiot, Mot ix tS avrn ptut' o suit yap irportpo; dvriut xxraXtyQii-., _% 'Apfi.tt.wt p.tt' 6 til vartpot [ot c>* vartpot, Pauw apud AVesselingium] Ix Marntuf o Si rtrxprot rut irorafo___t _ to^.t_ e^ei Tvtont.

They are all four confluent streams, which join the Tigris *, and not one of them reaches the sea with its own proper waters.

It is somewhere between Khorna and the sea that we are to look for the Ampe, mentioned in the sixth book of Herodotus, a town which he places at its issue. We cannot say at Ableh, for it seems to stand too high ; we cannot say at Abadan, for it possibly did not exist in that age ; but it ought to be in the Dauasir, or tract between the Khore Abdillah and the Shat-el-Arab, as Nebuchadnezzar founded Teredon on that projection of the con tinent, and consequently Teredon and its district existed previous to the age of Herodotus. Whether the Euphrates, even in that early age, came into the sea through the Khore Abdillah, as Arrian supposes, is highly problematical ; but that a canal, de rived from that river, passed through the Khore is ascertained. Its principal junction with the Tigris seems to have been at Khorna in all ages : its canals in various dis tricts have been mistaken for the main channel, by a multiplicity of geographers ; and this is the reason why it has by several been described as carried into the Tigris by the Nahar 26 Malcha, the Nahar Isa, or the Tsarsar ; and why its course is so little known below Babylon, as to produce an opinion that it was lost in the desert of Arabia : but it flows there still ; it is still navigable ; and notwithstanding the obstruc- -s The confusion seems to arise from Hero dotus himself, who says, in the sixth book, that the Tigris which flows by Ampe issues into the sea ; and in the first book, that the Tigris which flows by Opis discharges itself into the sea of Erythras, that is, the gulph of Persia. The expression in both passages is the same ; but Ampe, we may conclude, is at the mouth, and Opis is mentioned to shew that the principal river passes by that city, and that the tributary streams do not. There is still something not quite accurate in this, for the two Zabs join the Tigris above Opis. Tvitnt . . .

On the Rising of the Constellations. Dear Sir, HAVING at last finished the calculations Avhich are neces- sary to enable me to resolve your questions from Columella, I Avill endeavour to give you the best and plainest answers to them that I cam But to do this it may be necessary to say something concerning a branch of astronomy Avhich Avas much cultivated by the ancients, namely, the risings and settings of the stars, as they respect the rising and setting of the sun. The points chiefly attended to were, the times Avhen certain fixed stars, or constellations of stars, rose or set Avith the sun; the times Avhen those stars set as the sun rose, and the times Avhen they rose as the sun set. The determination of these points constituted a principal part of the astronomy of the ancients, and was esteemed by them of the utmost importance, because it Avas by these means that they regulated their festivals, judged of the returns of the seasons, and even estimated the length of the year. As the sun, apparently, revolves in the ecliptic annually from west to east, while the fixed stars remain constantly in the same place, it is manifest the sun must come into conjunction, at one 4 a"], [610, "APPENDIX. 546 time of the year or other, Avith every star. In the present age the sun comes into conjunction ; that is, into the same part of the heavens, Avith the Pleiades about the middle of May, and, in consequence, rises and sets about the same time that they do ; in this position, the constellation Avas said by the ancients to rise cosmically and set achronjcally. But it must be ob served, that in all places which have northern latitude, a star, Avhich is to the northward of the sun Avhen they are in conjunc tion, will rise at the same instant that the sun rises a few days before the sun comes into conjunction with it, on account of the obliquity of the sphere ; and will not set at the same instant the sun sets until the sun has passed the conjunction, and got to the eastAvard of the star : that is, the time Avhen the star rises cosmically happens some days before that Avhen it sets achrony cally ; and the number of days by Avhich the first of these cir cumstances precedes the latter depends partly on the latitude of the place, and partly on the distance Avhich the star is to the northward of the sun at the time of conjunction. On the con trary, if the star be south ofthe sun at the time of conjunction, the star will set achronycally before the conjunction, and will not rise cosmically till after it is past. The contrary to both these positions takes place in southern latitudes '. While the sun is westAvard of the point Avhich it is in Avhen it rises with the star, it is manifest that the sun must rise before the star, and, consequently, the rising of the star cannot be seen. It is as obvious that the rising of the star cannot be seen Avhen the sun and star rise together : but some time after that, 1 If the place of observation be between general rules do not hold good ; but they are the tropics, there are cases in which these two very limited, and not worth considering here,"], [611, "DISSERTATION Li. 547 Avhen the sun has got so far east of the star as to be considerably below the horizon Avhen the star rises, the twilight will be so little advanced that the star may be visible at its rising ; and, as soon as this was the case, the star was said to rise heliacally. The number of days that this circumstance happens after the time Avhen the star rises cosmically depends partly on the lati tude of the place, partly on the declinations of the sun and star, and partly on the star's brightness : it can therefore only be de termined, like the beginning and end of twilight, by observa tion. For the same reason, the star cannot be seen to set Avhen it sets at the same instant that the sun sets ; nor can it be seen to set for some days before that time, on account of the twi light : and when the sun approached so near to the star that it could be no longer seen to set, it Avas then said to set heliacally. These phenomena happen now about the latter end of May and the beginning of June. After this, the sun advancing still eastward in the ecliptic, Avhile the star keeps its situation, will have got so far beyond it, that some time in the beginning of November the sun will set as the star rises ; and the star is then said to rise achronycally. Moreover, the sun and star being at this time nearly in opposite points of the heavens, it must follow that about the same time, or a few days either before or after it, according as the place is in south or north latitude, and the star south or north of the sun at the time of conjunction, the star must set as the sun rises ; and Avhen it did so, it Avas said to set cosmically. The lono-itude and latitude of the Lucida Pleiad urn Avas deter mined Avith great accuracy by the late Dr. Bradley to be \u00bb 26\u00b0 38' 34\", and 4\u00b0 1' 36\" north respectively, at the beginning of 4 a 2"], [612, "APPENDIX. 548 the year 1?60;- from Avhence it Avill be readily found that, at this time, and in the latitude of Rome, the Pleiades rise cos mically on or about the 10th of May, and set achronycally about the 20th of the same month : and that they rise achrony cally about the 12th, and set cosmically about the 21st of November. These two last-mentioned circumstances, according to your extract from Columella, happened on the 10th of October and 8th of November, in the year 42 after Christ. You add, that according to Strabo, Nearchus sailed from the Indus, at the time Avhen the Pleiades rose in the evening, or achronycally in the year 326 before Christ ; that Arrian informs us this Avas on the 2d of October ; and you Avish to be informed how near these dates and circumstances agree together Avhen the precession of the equinoctial points is alloAved for. You wish also to have a popular explanation of the term Precession, in antecedentia, and an account of its application to, and effect on, the phenomena which have been explained above. The two points Avhere the ecliptic crosses the plane of the earth's equator are called the Equinoctial Points. That Avhich the sun is in on the 20th or 21st of March, Avhen he passes to the northward* of the plane of the earth's equator, is called the Vernal Equinoctial Point ; and the other is called the Autumnal Equinoctial Point. The earth is not a perfect sphere, but is in the form of such a boAvl as is used on a bowling-green; the two poles being. in the two flat sides, and its greatest diameters all in the plane of the equator. Now, as all bodies attract each other, the protuberant parts about the earth's equator are acted on by the sun and"], [613, "DISSERTATION Li. 549 moon, when they are out of the plane of that equator, in such a manner as to cause the two equinoctial points to be carried backward, along the ecliptic, at the rate of 50i seconds of a degree in a year ; and this motion of the equinoctial points is called, though somewhat improperly perhaps, the Precession of the Equinoctial Points. As the vernal equinoctial point is carried backward by the above-mentioned quantity yearly, Avhile the fixed stars retain their places, and as we continue to reckon the longitudes of the stars from that point, it is manifest the longitudes of the stars Avill be increased every year by 50| seconds. But as the mo- tion of these points is in the plane of the ecliptic, this apparent motion of the stars will be parallel to the ecliptic ; and, conse- quently, their distance from the ecliptic, Avhich is called their latitude, will not be altered by it. It must be farther observed that the year (as it relates to astronomy) always begins Avhen the sun is in the vernal equinoctial point ; from which it will be evident that it is later, by a small quantity, every year than it Avas the year before, when the sun comes to the same longitude with any particular star, or to that point of the ecliptic Avhere it rises or sets with it : and this is the cause why the Pleiades rise as the sun sets, and set as the sun rises, later now than they did formerly. It has been already said, that the longitude of the Lucida Pleiadum was a 26\u00b0 38' 34\", at the beginning of the year 1760 ; but in the 1718 years Avhich elapsed between the years 42 and I76O, the precession of the equinoxes, at the rate of 50*} seconds in a year, amounts to 86,4721 seconds, or 24\u00b0 1' 121\", which being taken from a 26\u00b0 38' 34', leaves a 2\u00b0 37' 21f\" for the"], [614, "55o APPENDIX. longitude of m Pleiadum in the year 42 after Christ : and, as the latitudes of the stars remain the same \\ the point of the ecliptic which then rose with this star Avas r 29\u00b0 T 9\", the ob liquity of the ecliptic being at that time 23\u00b0 41' 24\". Hence the point which set as the star rose was === 29\u00b0 T 9\" ; and this point, I find by Mayer's Tables, the sun Avas in on the 19th of Oc tober. By a similar process, I find that the point of the ecliptic Avhich rose as the Pleiades set was \u2022% 4\u00b0 20', which point the sun occupied on the 29th of October that year. The former of these determinations differs nine days, and the latter ten from the times assigned by Columella ; but it may be remarked that the former of these errors is in defect, and the latter in excess ; and as the stars rise and set sooner as the year advances, it folloAvs, that on the 10th of October the sun Avould set a short time before the star Avould rise, and on the 8th of November the star would set some time before the sun rose ; both Avhich circumstances appear to be necessary if these phe nomena Avere determined by observation, as, most probably, Avas the case. For it is manifest the star's rising cannot be ob served Avhen it rises exactly as the sun sets ; nor can its setting be seen when it sets exactly as the sun rises, on account of the daylight, as hath been already observed : but, perhaps, the one might be seen by a good eye, in the latitude of Rome, nine or ten days before, and the other as much after the time when the two circumstances happened together; and I have not a. doubt but that the difference between Columella's observation and my calculation is to be attributed to this cause. * I take no notice here of the very small fixed stars by the actions of the other planets -change which is caused in the places of the on the earth. 7"], [615, "DISSERTATION I. i. 55* I am next to inquire whether the effect of the precession of the equinoctial points will reconcile Strabo's account, Avhich states that Nearchus sailed at the time Avhen the Pleiades rose in the evening, that is to say, as the sun set, Avith the account of Arrian, Avho says expressly, that he sailed on the 2d of Oc tober in the year before Christ 326. In the interval between the 3Tear 42 after, and the year 326 before Christ, the precession amounts to 5\u00b0 8' 42 f\", which being taken from a 2\u00b0 37' 211\", the star's longitude in the year 42 after Christ, leaves r 27\u00b0 28' 38f \" for the longitude of the Lucida Pleiadum in the year 326 before Christ ; and the point of the ecliptic Avhich rose with the star, in this situation, at Rome, in the year 326 before Christ, the ob liquity of the ecliptic being then-,230 44' 13\", was v 19\u00b0 26' 41\" : but as the sun Avas setting Avhen the star rose, it must have been in ==\u25a0* 19\u00b0 26' 41\", the opposite point of the ecliptic, which point the sun occupied on the 17th of October ; fifteen days after that which is fixed by Arrian for the sailing of Nearchus. Now if nine or ten days Avere sufficient to render the rising of the Pleiades visible at Rome, Ave are eertaki that more could not be requisite to render their rising visible at the place Nearchus sailed from, which is in a much lower latitude ; we are there fore led to suppose, either that Strabo spake in general terms, (as indeed seems to be the case,) meaning only to point out the season, and not the day Avhen Nearchus set out on- his ex pedition, Avhile Arrian gave the precise day on which it hap pened, or that some mistake has crept into one or the other of these authors: to me, the former supposition seems most natural."], [616, "APPENDIX 55^ But notwithstanding it is highly probable that the apparent difference between the two historians ought to be referred to one or other of these causes, it is by no means certain that either one or other of them must be resorted to. It is possible that it ought to be attributed to another cause. The preceding calculation is founded on a supposition that the Julian calendar has been in use ever since the year 326 before Christ ; but Ave know it Avas not established by laAv till about 45 years before Christ, and that before that \u00e6ra different modes of computation wrere used by different persons, who did not ahvays tell us Avhat mode of computation they made use of. Noav, notwithstanding both Arrian and Strabo refer to the same authority, it is possible the years by which that author reckoned might differ from Julian years ; and if they did, a greater dif ference than that Avhich exists between them might arise from that circumstance. There is a circumstance occurs in the foregoing calculations which may lead some persons to conclude I have committed a mistake in them ; and which it is therefore necessary to obviate. The quantity of the precession in the interval betAveen the year 326 before, and the year 42 after Christ is 5\u00b0 8' 42f\", a space Avhich the sun is more than five days passing over. It may therefore be supposed, that the difference between the achro nycal risings of the same star, at these tAvo times, ought to be between five and six days, Avhereas I make it little more than -two : but it must be considered, that near three of these five days are anticipated by the excess of the Julian year above the \u00a3rue length of the solar year in that interval"], [617, "DISSERTATION I. i. 553 This, Sir, is the plainest answer I can give to the questions you have been pleased to propose.

Dear Sir, '^7'OU Avill receive, I hope, some satisfaction from the result \u25a0*\u2022 of my calculations upon the different dates, assigned by Arrian and Strabo, to the commencement of Nearchus's expedi tion ; which at first, I confess, I thought too discordant to be reconciled by any probable conjecture, Avithout tampering Avith the text of Arrian, Avhich, in my judgment, seemed to carry some marks of corruption. The method I have taken has been to go directly to the in vestigation of the time of the acronychal rising of the Pleiades, in that part of the Avorld Avhere the voyage was undertaken, in the year before Christ 326, Avhich was the year of the voyage ; and, for a reason Avhich Avill presently appear, I have not con cerned myself at all Avith Columella's risings or settings. Arrian says, that Nearchus sailed from the mouth of the Indus as soon as the Etesi\u00e6 ceased, in the eleventh year of the reign of Alexander, according to the reckoning of the Macedonians and the Asiatics, and on the 20th of the Athenian month Boe dromion. This eleventh of the reign of Alexander, it is agreed, was the year before the vulgar \u00e6ra of our Lord 326 ; and the 4"], [619, "DISSERTATION I. ii. 555 20th of Boedromion in this year, upon the authority of eminent chronologers, you take to have been the 1st of October, St. Jul. And in this reduction, if there be any error, which, though I suspect, I will not too confidently assert, it cannot be of more than a single day. Strabo's account is, that \" the fleet sailed in autumn about the season of the evening rising of the Pleiades, before the Avinds Avere fair, the barbarians attacking them and forcing them to sea.\" This claims great attention, for it is Nearchus's own account. The words of Strabo import as much, and the thing speaks, in some measure, for itself. The character, by which the time is described, is of a sort to have been taken from the journals of the mariners themselves ; for any second-hand writer of the voyage Avould have expressed it in a more popular manner, by affixing to it, as Ave see Arrian has clone, a precise date, or a date at least pretending to precision, in some well-known civil reckoning. But if this character ofthe time of the commence ment of the expedition came from the original journals of the mariners ; it folloAVs, that some two or three days before they sailed, or two or three days after, (for in this sort of date no greater accuracy is to be expected,) they saw the Pleiades risen in the east, some short space of time after the sun was set in the west ; or rather, since the star could not be seen when the sun Avas yet upon the horizon, they saw the star about an hour after sunset Avith that altitude, that they concluded it had risen at the moment when the sun set. We have to inquire, therefore, on what day of the year, in the year of this voyage, namely before Christ 326, the Pleiades 4b 2"], [620, "APPENDIX. 556 rose acronychally in that part of the world, from Avhich these voyagers set out ; that is to say, at the mouth of the Indus. If this should be found to agree Avith Arrian's date, all \"will be Avell. If not, the ph\u00e6nomena of the Roman horizon in the time of Columella, even upon the supposition that Columella's representation of them is exact, Avill throw no light upon our subject. Now I assume 24\u00b0 north for the latitude of the mouth of the Indus. This is nearly the truth ; and I take the even number, because the difference of one-half of a degree, more or less, Avill not affect the result of the calculation. By Dr. Bradley 's observations, the longitude of Lucida Pleiadum, in the beginning of the year 1760, Avas a 26\u00b0 38' 34\", and the latitude 4\u00b0 1' 36\" north. The interval of time, betAveen the beginning ofthe year 1760 and the beginning of the year before Christ 326, is 2085 Julian years ; and, in this time, the retrogradation of the equinoctial points amounts to 29\u00b0 7' 55\". Therefore, in the beginning of the year before Christ 326, the longitude of Lucida Pleiadum was \u2022*\u2022\u2022*\u2022 27\u00b0 30' 39\", and the lati tude 4\u00b0 1' 36\" north. The obliquity ofthe ecliptic at this same time Avas 23\u00b0 44' 14\". In the figure annexed, let II Ah, DAd, tOE, represent the horizon, the equinoctial circle and the ecliptic, all projected upon the plane of the meridian of the mouth of the Indus, at the instant Avhen Lucida Pleiadum is rising. Let the ecliptic intersect the horizon, on the eastern side in O ; and on the western, in o. Let * be Lucida Pleiadum upon the eastern horizon ; then O Avill be the point of the ecliptic, which comes"], [621, "DISSERTATION I. ii. 557 to the eastern horizon, and rises with the star; and the opposite point in the west, o, will be the point of the ecliptic, Avhich sets when the star rises. Through * draw a great circle.of latitude * B S, meeting the ecliptic in B, and the equinoctial in S. Then, in the spherical triangle r B S, Ave have the angle at B right.

Therefore, by the resolu tion of the triangle, Ave find the angle B S r = 69\u00b0 4' 57\", and the side BS = 11\u00b0 28' 56\". But the arc * B is the latitude of Lucida Pleiadum, = 4\u00b0 1' 36\" ; and * S = * B + B S = 15\u00b0 30' 32\". Therefore, in the spherical triangle * S A, Ave have the side * S = 15\u00b0 30' 32\"; the angle * S A (or BS r) = 69\u00b0 4' 57\", and the angle * A S, the complement of the latitude of the place, = 66\u00b0. Therefore, by the resolution of the triangle, avc find the angle S * A = 43\u00b0 24' 29\".

But when the star is really upon the eastern horizon, it appears, by the effect of the refraction of the atmosphere, at the height of about half a de gree above it. And if the sun at the same time Avere setting upon the Avestern horizon, he would appear, from the same cause, at the height of about half a degree above it ; so that on the day Avhen the sun is really upon the Avestern horizon, at the same instant when the star is really upon the eastern, the star by the effect of refraction will have risen, and the sun will not be set. What Ave want to find is the day Avhen the star Avould be seen rising, and the sun seen setting at the same instant, if the star could be seen in the light of the setting sun ; which will be an earlier day, than that Avhereon the rising star and set ting sun Avould come to the eastern and Avestern horizon respec tively at the same time. To determine this day of the visible acronychal rising of the star, Ave must estimate the effect of re fraction both upon the star and upon the sun. The effect of refraction upon the star will easily be ascertained by means of the angle S * A, the quantity of which we have already deter mined ; and this is the only use of the calculation, so far as Ave have yet carried it.

Now since the light of the rising star upon the horizon is thrown, by the effect of refraction, up to R, in the vertical circle, so as to appear in the heavens in the point R ; the star, which, Avithout refraction, Avould be seen, Avhere it really is, at the point * in the circle of latitude * B, appears at the point R in the circle of latitude R \u00a3.

Hence R \u00a3, the apparent latitude of the re fracted star, = R a- + <r \u00a3 = 4\u00b0 22' 48\", and r \u00a3, its apparent longitude, = v B- B \u00a3 = t 27\u00b0 8' 11\"."], [624, "APPENDIX. s6\u00b0 Now then, in Figure 1, we must resume the resolution of the triangles, making use of the star's apparent longitude and lati tude, instead of the true.

Therefore, in the spherical triangle * S A, we have the side * S = 15\u00b0 43' 17\" ; the angle * S A = 69\u00b0 0' 30\" ; and the angle * A S, the complement of the latitude of the place, = 66\u00b0.

We must inquire, Avhat the sun's true place must be, in order that the horizontal refraction may throw his light into the point o ; for the time when this happens will be the true acronychal rising. And for this purpose Ave must estimate the effect of the horizontal refraction upon the sun's apparent longitude ; and this depends upon the angle Avhich the ecliptic, at sun#rise or sun-set, makes Avith the horizon ; that is upon the angle r O A (Figure 1.) or its equal * 0 B. The angle * O B is easily found, by resolving the spherical triangle \u2022* O B, in which the angle at B is a right angle ; the angle B * O = 43\u00b0 29' 34\", and the side * B = 4\u00b0 22' 48\".

In the triangle Row, Avhich, for the smallness of its sides, may be treated as a rectilinear triangle, the angle at u is a right angle. The angle R O u, being the complement of * OB, is 43\u00b0 20' 3\". Hence O u comes out 22' 26\" ; and this, as has been said, is the effect of the horizontal refraction upon the rising sun's apparent longitude, his true place being O,, in the latitude of 24\u00b0 north. And the same will be the quantity of the effect upon the setting sun, in the opposite point of the ecliptic o, in the same latitude ; for the quantity of the effect in any given latitude, upon the rising sun, in any given point of the ecliptic, and of the effect upon the setting sun in the opposite point of the ecliptic, will be the same ; the angle Avhich the ecliptic in opposite points makes with the horizon, upon which the effect depends, being equal : but the effect lies, in the two cases, in opposite directions ; the refraction making the apparent longi tude of the rising sun Avest of his true place, and the apparent longitude of the setting sun east of his true place. Hence, that refraction might throw the light of the sun to the point o in the western horizon, at the same instant of time Avhen refraction brought the light of Lucida Pleiadum to the eastern. horizon, in the climate in question, we must put the sun's true place 22' 26\" Avest ofthe point o. The point o has been found to be 22\u00b0 59' 32\" ; therefore the sun's true place, in order that the required effect should be pro duced, must have been =* 22\u00b0 37' 6\".

The 19th of October (St. Jul.) therefore Avas the day of the aeronychal rising of Lucida Pleiadum, upon the horizon of the mouth of the Indus, in the year before Christ 326, i. e. in the year of the Julian period 4388. It may perhaps strike you as a difficulty, that the time that our calculation gives for the appulse of the sun to the required place, falling between three and four o'clock in the morning of the 20th, under the meridian of the mouth of the Indus, the sun was actually set on the 19th many hours before he came to that point of the ecliptic, which Avould have made a precise aeronychal rising of the star, had the instant of the sun's ap pulse, in his annual course, to that point coincided with the instant of sunset : but this not being the case, you may Avonder how Ave can say there Avas an aeronychal rising at all. Now this is really the fact; that, speaking with geometrical precision, there was in this year no day of an exact aeronychal rising of Lucida Pleiadum ; and it very seldom happens, that there is an exact aeronychal rising of any star at any place, if we insist upon this strict sense of the Avords ; because it very seldom happens, that the instant of the sun's appulse to the re quired point in the ecliptic, and the instant of sunset, are the 4c 2"], [628, "APPENDIX. 5^4 same. They may differ several hours ; and the same thing hap pens in the cosmical and heliacal risings and settings ; neverthe less, there will always be a day, Avhen the rising Avill be nearer to aeronychal, than in any other. And this, physically speak ing, is the day of the aeronychal rising ; and, in our case, the 19th Avas that da}T; for on the 19th the sun, at the hour of sun set, Avas 24' 45'' of longitude behind the required place. On the 20th, at the hour of sunset, he was 35' 58\" before it ; so that the setting sun Avas much nearer to the required place on the 19th than the 20th. I fear you Avill find the accuracy, Avith which I have pursued these calculations, tedious ; but I have chosen to give them in detail, that they may be the more easily examined. I have been diffuse upon the refractions, because the effect of refraction upon the longitude and latitude of celestial objects, though a matter of no difficulty to mathematicians, is not generally un derstood ; and yet is very intelligible, if those Avho are masters of it Avould take the trouble to explain it. The 19th of October (St. Jul.) you see Avas the day of the aeronychal rising of Lucida Pleiadum at the mouth of the In dus, in the year of our voyage.

I have never examined DodAvell's Tables of the Metonic Cycles. I make use of a A^ery compendious Table of my OAvn, by Avhich I can, in a very few minutes, ascertain, on Avhat day of the Julian year the 1st of Hecatomb\u00e6on, in any given year"], [629, "DISSERTATION I. ii. 565 \u00a9f any given Metonic Cycle, fell, according to the principles upon Avhich my Table is formed. And the 1st of Hecatomb\u00e6on, i. e. the beginning of the year, being once determined, the wrhole year is easily reduced to the Julian reckoning, by a general Table of the Cycle. In the principles upon which my Table is formed, I agree not entirely either with Scaliger or Petavius. In the order of the months, I agree with Scaliger. I agree with Scaliger in the epoch of the first Cycle ; placing it on the 15th of July, not on the l6th with Petavius. I place the Emboli m\u00e6an month in the 3d, 6th, 9th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th years of the Cycle : in which I agree entirely Avith Petavius,, except in the third Embolism, which he (with Scaliger and Dodwell) places on the 8th year of the Cycle. I put it in the 9th ; dissenting, I confess, in this from every one. In the ar rangement of the ex\u00e6resimal days, I follow the very best autho rity I knoAV, that of the learned astronomer Geminus. Now the year of the voyage in question Avas the year of the Julian period 4388 ; it Avas therefore the 107th Metonic year ; that is, the 12th year of the 6th Cycle. That is to say, five Cycles were completely run out, since the first introduction of this 19-year period, and the 12th year of the 6th Cycle Avas in its course. And I find by my OAvn Tables, that the 1st of Hecatomb\u00e6on, in the 12th year of the 6th Cycle, fell on the 15th of July (St. Jul.). Add 29 days (for the Hecatomb\u00e6on of this year Avas a hollow month), and we come to the 1st of Me tageitnion, on the 13th of August. Add 30 days (for Meta geitnion of this year was a full month), and Ave come to the 1st of Boedromion, on the 12th of September. The 12th of Sep tember being the 1st of Boedromion, the 1st of October ought to be the 20th of Boedromion. But Boedromion in this year"], [630, "566 APPENDIX. was a hollow month, and the ex\u00e6resimal day came before the 20th, being the 18th ; therefore the 30th of September Avas the day which, according to my principles, Avas counted the 20th of Boedromion in this year. By Scaliger's principles, the 20th of this Boedromion Avill fall on the very same day, the 30th of September. By Petavius's, one day later, namely on the 1st -of October. It is certain, therefore, that on one of these two days, either the 30th of September or the 1st of October, Nearchus sailed from the mouth of the Indus,' according to Arrian ; conse quently, he had been eighteen or nineteen days at sea, before the day came of the aeronychal rising of Lucida Pleiadum ; taking aeronychal rising strictly, according to the mathematical definition of the terms. It is true, that Strabo's Avords import not that the fleet sailed on the very day, but at the season only, of the aeronychal rising of the Pleiades ; but yet eighteen or nineteen days seemed too great a difference to admit even this lax description of the time. I Avas at first, therefore, inclined to suspect an error in the name of the month in Arrian ; and I tried a conjectural emendation ; but the severe test of a strict calculation compelled me to discard it. After various conjectures, and many long calculations, I am entirely persuaded, that Mr. Wales's very ingenious conjecture, by Avhich he reconciles his calculation of the aeronychal rising ofthe Pleiades at Rome, in the year of our Lord 42, Avith Colu mella's date, is the only solution, and the true solution of the difficulty. The perfect agreement that it Avill produce between Arrian and Strabo, in the time of Nearchus's sailing, is indeed astonishing."], [631, "DISSERTATION I. H. ss7 Mr. Wales observes, that the exact aeronychal rising of a star is never visible, on account of the sun's light; but it is equally true, that the rising of the star for several evenings before the day of the aeronychal rising will not be visible : for the sun must not only be set, but he must be set and sunk to a certain distance below the horizon, for the twilight to be sufficiently faint to alloAv the fixed stars to appear. Suppose then, that on a certain day, no matter Avhat, the sun is sunk somewhat below that distance, Avhen a particular star is upon the eastern hori- zon ; on that evening, if the sky be clear, the rising of the star may be observed. Suppose, that the next night the sun is not sunk quite to the required distance, Avhen the same star is upon the eastern horizon : then the rising of the star will not be visible ; and Avhen the star becomes visible, it will be seen at some small distance above the horizon : the next night, it will be at a greater height above the horizon, Avhen it is first seen ; the third, a greater still ; and, on the evening of true aeronychal rising, the star will have gained a very considerable height, Avhen it is first seen. It certainly Avas very natural (and it Avas the only Avay for popular use) for the ancients to call that the evening of the aeronychal rising, on Avhich they first missed the sight of the rising star. The distance beloAv the horizon, to Avhich the sun must be sunk Avhen a star first becomes visible, is different according to the magnitude of the star. Lucida Pleiadum is a star of the third magnitude; and Ptolemy says, that stars of the third magnitude first become visible when the sun is sunk 14\u00b0 below the horizon. Noav I find by calculation, that in the year ofthe Voyage (of the Julian period 4388), when the sun was 14\u00b0 be- Ioav the western horizon, at the same instant of time Avhen Lu-"], [632, "APPENDIX. 568 cida Pleiadum came to the eastern horizon, his true place must have been *== 3\u00b0 33' 56\" ; and he came to this place in that year, September 30, 12hrs 59' (St Jul.) mean time under the meridian of GreenAvich. Apply, as before, the proper correction for the efect cf the precession upon the longitude of Lucida Pleiadum, namely + 15', and Ave have September 30, 13hrs 14' mean time under the meridian of GreenAvich. Add 4h\" 36', and Ave have September 30, 17h\" 50' mean time under the meridian of the mouth of the Indus ; which, as Ave in our civil reckoning divide the day, Avas 10' before six in the morning of the 1st of Oc tober. On the evening, therefore, of the 30th of September, the sun (setting in that latitude about 5hts 57' 26\", apparent time after noon) Avould be many minutes more than 14\u00b0 below the horizon, Avhen Lucida Pleiadum Avas rising. The rising of the star, therefore, that evening might be seen a minute or two later than lhr 0' 24\" after sunset ; but the next evening, the 1st of October, the sun Avould be only 13\u00b0 37' 15\" below the horizon, Avhen the star was rising, wanting 22' 45\" of the full depression cf 14\u00b0. This evening, therefore, the star could not be seen upon the horizon. But as the sun sunk at the rate of 13' 40\" in 1' of time, he Avould sink to the limit of 14\u00b0 in 1' 40\" of time after the instant of the star's rising : and as the star rises in the latitude of 24\u00b0 north, at the rate of 13' 11\" in 1' of time, the star, lhr 0' 24\" after sunset, and 1' 40\" after the moment of its own rising, Avould break through the expiring tAvilight with the ap parent altitude of 21' 5.8\" (I say with the apparent altitude, for the effect of refraction upon the star is included in these cal culations). This altitude is very sensible to the naked eye, be- ing scarce less than f of the Avhole diameter of the sun : but the 2"], [633, "D I S S E R T A T I O N I. H. 569 next evening (Oct. 2d) would certainly put the matter out of doubt ; for, on the 2d of October, the star, at the same distance of time after sunset, would break through the remains of the twilight, Avith the very sensible altitude of 1\u00b0 2' 48\" at the mo ment of its first apparition. Whence our mariners would con clude, that the sensible acronychism was past. It appears, therefore, that what these mariners would call the aeronychal rising of the Pleiades, took place either on the very day the fleet sailed, or the next, or, at the latest, the next day but one. Thus, by a train of calculations of considerable length and labour, but ofthe greatest certainty, and pursued Avith the most scrupulous accuracy, by the help of Mr. Wales's suggestion, the ingenuity of Avhich I cannot sufficiently admire, Ave have brought the two accounts of Strabo and Arrian to a perfect good agree ment.

You will perhaps suspect that I have committed a mis take in the very entrance upon these calculations, by reckoning the interval between the commencement of the year before our Lord 326 and the commencement ofthe year of our Lord 1760, no more than 2085 Julian years, Avhereas you may think it was 2086. The truth hoAvever is, that, through carelessness, I fell 4 D"], [634, "57o APPENDIX. into the opposite mistake ; I reckoned the interval 2086 Julian years instead of 2085 ; and, bj* this inadvertency, I gave my self the trouble of going through the whole calculation from be ginning to end a second time, and of correcting all my num bers ; though the error accruing from this over-reckoning of that interval, might Avell have been neglected in this investigation. To understand Iioav it is that the lesser is the true interval, you must knoAV that it is the uniform error of chronologers, reckon ing by the \u00e6ra of our Lord, to reckon the years before our Lord too many by one. The year which chronologers call the year before Christ 326, Avas the year of the Julian period 4388, as you may see by turning to Blair's Tables, Petavius, or Usher. The year of our Lord 1760 Avas the year of the Julian period 6473 ; the interval, therefore, is 2085 Julian years. The reck oning by the \u00e6ra of our Lord, when Ave have to do Avith time antecedent to the \u00e6ra, is seldom conducted with precision but in astronomical tables. If you turn to Mayer's Tables, you will find there, in the first page of the Epochs of the Sun's Motions (p. 6.), and again in the first page ofthe Moon's Epochs (p. 36.), a year of Christ, 0 ; and it appears by the epochs ascribed to this year of Christ, 0, that it is the year of the Julian period 4713. Noav, the year of the Julian period 4713, chronologers call, as you Avill see again by their tables, the year before Christ 1 ; at the same time they call the next succeeding year of the Julian period, viz. 4714, the year after Christ 1 ; and by this inaccuracy of their language, they in effect represent the interval betAveen any numerical day of the year 4713 ofthe period (the 1st of March for instance) and the same numerical day of the very next year of the period, as consisting of two Avhole years instead of one."], [635, "D I S S E R T A T I O N I. ii. 571 Since I finished my calculations I have, almost accidentally, met Avith what I deem a strong' confirmation of the accuracy of the conclusion to which they have brought us. In Archbishop Usher's Ephemeris of the Macedonian year, I find this entry against the 8th day of the month Dius. \" Euctemoni vespertina V apparent Pleiades.\" The 8th of the month Dius, according to Usher's reduction of the Macedonian year, Avas the 1st of October (St. Jul.) Euctemon the astronomer is mentioned by Ptolemy as Meton's assistant, in the observation of the sum mer solstice. He flourished, therefore, in Greece, about a cen tury earlier than the time of this expedition. I imagine that Archbishop Usher took this date of Euctemon's evening rising of the Pleiades from Geminus, reducing Gemt nus's date to the Macedonian year; for in Geminus's parapegm, which he gives in the 16th chapter of his Isagoge, I find this entry : Toi* Je Qjyov SixiropeveTOLt 0 i*>A<*>j ev A.

The sun entered Libra, according to Euctemon and Meton, Septem ber 27th ; his 5th day in Libra, therefore, was October 1, the 8th of Usher's Dius. On the 5th day of the sun's passage through the sign of Libra, he was in the 5th degree of Libra according to the mean mo tions ; and the prosthaph\u00e6resis at this time being 1* 38', Avith the negative sign, his true place Avas in the third degree of Libra.

It seems to have been current among the Romans themselves, but it must have been founded on a gross estimation of the length of the Olympic stadium. The Romans, in their popular valuation of the Greek measures, would be apt to reckon eight Olympic stadia to be exactly equal to their own mile, taking no account of the fraction mentioned by Polybius. Hence they would infer, that the Olympic stadium Avas 125 Roman passus, i. e. 625 Roman feet, which is, indeed, the length expressly assigned to it by Pliny. But it Avas very Avell knoAvn, that this stadium%as but 600 of its OAvn feet.

If Ptolemy had determined the meridian of Londinium by the difference of time betAveen that place and the meridian of Alexandria, as it is believed by Marinus and some others, I do not know how we could be justified in the reduction of his longitude, or, Avhich is the same thing, in the augmentation of his degree ; but these horary differences have been deduced from the graduation itself, Avhich is the result only of itinerary distances shortened beyond measure by Ptolemy, in order to bring all the places Avithin his stereographic projection ; thence his degree of a great circle contains a fifth less of stadia than it ought to contain, viz. 500 instead of 600. In his first Map of Europe, Ptolemy places London 20 de grees to the east of the Fortunate Islands. In the account of the most remarkable places where celestial observations are sup posed to have been made, the horary difference betAveen London and Alexandria is 2 hours 40 minutes, or 40 degrees. Noav, as Alexandria is 4 hours distant from the Fortunate Islands, the same longitude of 20 degrees east of these isles is again found for the meridian of London."], [641, "DISSERTATION II. 577 Longitude of London from Ferro, according o to Ptolemy, - - j According to Dr. Maskelyne's Tables, - 17 40 13 Error of Ptolemy, - - - 2 19 47 o j it Longitude of London from Alexandria, aco cording to Ptolemy, - - 5 According to the connoissance des temps, 30 1 6 9 Error of Ptolemy, - - - 9 43 51 Which ought to be, - - - 10 13 51 if you follow the editions which place Alexandria in 40\u00b0 30'.

Now if we decrease by a fifth the difference ex pressed in the Alexandrian Geographer, we shall have 42' to deduct, which will bring that interval to 2\u00b0 48', or pretty near the true one. This I look upon as the longitude really assigned by Ptolemy between London and Paris. The same operation made in respect to the longitude of Lon don from Ferro, or the Fortunate Isles, will bring London to 16\u00b0 instead of 17\u00b0 40' 13\", and then the error is only 1\u00b0 40' 13\". The distance between the meridians of London and Alexandria is also reduced by that means to 32\u00b0, and the error in that im mense space becomes less than 2\u00b0. 4 B"], [642, "APPENDIX. 573 The maps of Ptolemy, constructed upon the principle of his short degree, have given the Mediterranean an extent of about 20\u00b0 of longitude more than it ought to have, Avhen in reality the author has not exceeded the true length by 4\u00b0, or thereabout. This enormous disfiguration Avas folloAved aud improved during 14 centuries.

After the impression of this work was completed, I obtained from Mr. Arrow smith a map of Suaiana, in which, by a variety of geographical combinations, he had found it necessary to compress the respective distances between Teredon and the A'rosis, as well as between Teredon and the Gaban channel : the former he reduced to 75 nautical miles, and the latter to 48, equal nearly to 96 and 58 Roman miles respectively. And as the distance from Teredon to the A'rosis differs only three miles from M'Cluer, it may be concluded that the disagreement of authorities, stated p. 481. may be reduced to this standard. The consequence is, that the whole of the diminution which we gain on the distance frem Teredon to the Gaban channel, is so much advantage in favour of Nearchus, who calculates 2000 stadia, or 133 miles to the village at the confluence of the Pasitigris \u2022, and although this is still inaccurate, it is little more so than the distance between Teredon and the A'rosis. Upon these measures, Nearchus himself acknowledges, that it was impossible to be exact, from the nature of the navigation ; and, therefore, if we obtain an approximation to the truth, it is all that can be expected. The map is inserted at p. 481. : it embraces all the different statements and contra dictions of the ancient historians compared with the Oriental geographers, and rectified by the march of Timour. The course of the rivers from their sources, and their issues into the sea, may be depended on. Some allowance must be made for their intermediate direction, as there were no authorities, ancient or modern, to consult ; but the latitude of the places by which they pass has been carefully attended to, and the line of their course laid down accordingly. \u2014 In consequence, it may be presumed that their accuracy is sufficient to answer the purpose of history, and that the whole has been arranged with as mnch precision as the scanty materials furnished to Mr. Arrowsmith permitted a geographer of his superior merit to attain.
