That though, would be no easy matter- But where there is a wiU th, r,_ is a way to ac complish anything aud everything ; bo Heron not the wounded traveller on to his shoulder, urging him to hold by him in any *ay he coald so as not to fall ; and by an exertion of that great strength which he, Heron, possessed, bnt which in tuis instance was sorely tested, he fairly climbed up the rope. \" Help, Edith 1\" She flew to the trap in the floor of the ward robe, aad most materially aided Heron to emerge from it with his burden.

Halloa!\" \" Yes, Mr Wild.\" \" Come up here, you Swiney.\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild.\" The rain was nearly over, and a brisk wins. was scattering the few drops that remained of it, in the minutest particles through the air. \" Off, and away, my men,\" he cried. \" For all I know, we have got no time to lose.\" The jinissaries tightened their grasp on the reins of their horses, and prepared for a start. \"Come down, Swiney,\" cried Wild \u2014 \"come down 1\" One of the janissaries at once dismounted, and giving his horse to one of his comrades to hold, he made his way up the stairs to the room. \" Stay here !\" was Wild's brief order to the man. \" Yes, Mr. Wild.\" \" And, Swiney!\" \" Yes, sir.\" \" In case you should be dull, I wUl leave you this lady to keep you company.\" \" All light, Mr, Wild.\" The woman of the inn from this felt that she was a prisoner. It did not require the sudden movement of the man S winey to a station between her and the door to convince her of that state of things. But Swiney did not answer. \" Come down, I say !\" Still no reply. \" Idiot!\" roared Wild ; \"do yon not hear me?\" As he spoke, Jonathan dashed into the house again- and not without a certain misgiving in his mind, lushed up the staircase. He rsached the room in a few seconds. \" Come down, will you, and mount ? Who is to wait for you, I wonder _ \" But no Swiney was there. The room was perfectly empty. Both Swiney and the woman of the \" Woodman \" inn had disappeared. The fact was that Jonathan Wild had made up hia mind to search the house, and he thought he should be ab e to do that much more conveniently without the woman than with her. Wild looked about him with surprise, and a sensation of fear began to creep over him. The mysteries of that house were, just then, too many for him ; and that enperstitious element, which we have had occasion to remark was in his nature, began to make itself felt \" What's the meaning of all this ?\" he sai 1 He moved slowly towards the door as he spoke, for he did not like to trust himseU further into the room than necessary. \" Speak,\" he added, \" if you are anywhere that you can hear me \u2014 I charge you, speak !\" A deep, awful, hollow groan was the response. Where it came from, Wild could not possibly divine. It seemed to be in the air of thi room, exactly about the middle of it It required no great stretoh of fancy on the part of one prepared to beUeve in supernatural agencies, to think that it came from some being there present but in visible to mortal eyes Wild got nearer still to the door. \"What? Who? Whatareyou?\" There was no reply. Wild roUed down the stairs, his hanger, that he wore by his side, rattling and bumping on the steps as he went \"Confound the place!\" he muttered. \"I will come and burn it down, or blow it np, or pull it down, brick by brick, but I wiU find out what is the meaning of all this.\" The disappearance of the man Swiney, and the possible peril that he might be in, did not give Jonathan Wild any concen The principle he went upon with his men was, that if they could not, or did not, take care of themselves, it was no fault of his. Swiney was therefore left to his fate, whatever that might be. Bat something more important than the disap pearance of that man was yet to happen before Jonathan could bid a temporary good-bye to the * Woodman\" inn. His foot was actually in the stirrup of his horse, and his men were almost on the move, when, slowly approaching the inn yard, by a narrow path that led through a neglected garden, and terminated at a email gate, there appeared two persons. Leaving, then, Mr. S winey on guard, Wild made a rambling progress through the \" Woodman\" inn ; but he found nothing to recompense him for his trouble but an eld silver tankard, which he at once, upon ascertaining what it was, pnt into his pocket Wild did not propose to make any lengthened -stay at that inn. It was only stress of weather that had induced him to stop at it at all ; and he thought he would in reality lose no time if he waited until the heavy down-pour of rain had ran off tbe roads and made them a little more passable. Jonathan Wild was in reality bound for Epping Forest He did not think it likely that Felix Heron and Edith would venture to seek the forest until night fall, aiid he had conceived the idea of holding pos session of that same road to it, which he knew on two occasions before was tho one that Felix Heron used on approaching hb sylvan home. That he might by such an act of audacity and daring, s cceed in making prisoners both of Edith and bleron was just probable enough to recom mend the attempt to him. Whether he was le ally justified, or not, in so doing, never troubled him for a moment. He suspected something wrong about the supposed reprieve for Edith, and when that something wrong came to be understood, it would be a grsat triumph to him to be able to say that he would produce the prisoner again. Nothing would be easier for him to do, pro vided he had E ith in his house, called Little Newgate. Hi\u00bb intention in regard to Felix Heron was of a much more sanguinary character. Wild fully intended to take the life of Heron now whenever and wherever he oould. The pain in his neck from the half completed banging at Castleneau House was still amply suffi cient to keep that little episode in his existence fully present to his imagination- The murder of Heron, therefore, was a some thing that Wild, over and over again, told him self he should not be happy tiU he had effected Having, then, completed his search of the \" Woodman\" inn, aud found nothing to reward him but the old silver tankard, Jonathan Wild we t down to the little tavern in front, where his Those persons carried stout sticks, which had evidently been recently cut from a hedge, and they had tbe appearance of being ratbtr uavei- worn, if not weary. ,iL v.v a,;."], [11, "5 EDITH HERON. The approaching wayfarers did not seem to see the horsemen in the inn yard a moment sooner than they themselves were seen. The fact was tbat the Uttle path by which they approached had a curve in it which shut off the view of the open space in front of the inn where Wild and his men were assembled, until the two travellers almost actually reached the gate. Then Wild uttered just such a shout as some ancient hnnter might, perhaps, in the primeval forests of England have uttered when he saw his game in sight. That ory was more than enough to awaken the two travellers to a sense of danger. The surprise, however, of this encounter with Jonathan Wild and a strong party of officers, all that distance from London, was too much to be overcome on the instant by the two travellers. They stood by the little gate as if they had been petrified. Then Wild raised another shout of gratification, and tearing from the saddle of his horse the two holster pistols, he presented them fuU at the two travellers, as he cried, * Stir hand or foot on peril of your lives !\" He knew them weU. \" But I know it,\" said Wild ; \" and I give you the chance of death here upon the spot, or of oapture.\" \" I don't think,\" laid Ogle, \" that Mr. Valentine, the officer, who I see here, would countenance the deliberate and cold-blooded murder of any one.\" \" No,\" said tbe officer alluded to ; \" but if Mr. Wild hag good cause to apprehend you, I cannot answer for accidents provided you resist\" \" We don't resist,\" said Ogle ; \" but we give in to Mr. ValeLtine, and hold him responsible for our lives.\" \" No !\" cried Wild ; \u00ab that won't do at all !\" \"I think, Mr. Wild, it wiU be better,\" said Valentine. \" If you have any oharge against these two persons, you had better give them into my custody, and then nobody can say anything.\" \"They are two of the most notorious of she band of Captain Felix Heron.\" \" Indeed !\" \" Yes ; and that man Ogle, you know, or ought to know, well, for he was onse in my service \" \" Well, I do know him by sight ; but you don't mean to say, Mr. Wild, that the boy is a robber on the highway ? \" \" I do I\" And who did they know in aU the world better than they knew him ? They were old acquaintances \u2014 old acquaint ances of Jonathan Wild, and old acquaintances of our readers. Tom Ripon looked as if he could then and there have eaten Mr. Valentine, the Bow Street officer, with half a grain of salt \" If,\" he said, \" a man falls into misfortune, he oughtn't to be insulted and c. lied a boy.\" Valentine spoke then to Ogle \" Yon had better not make a fight of it,\" he said. \" What's the regular and precise charge against them, Mr. WUd ? \" They were none others than Ogle and Tom Ripon. Taking advantage of a stage coach, whioh took them about a third of the way to Epping Forest and completely clear of London and its environs, Ogle and Tom had resolved then to walk the re mainder of the way. Overtaken by the terrific storm, they had pro tected themselves aa well as they conld among the trees and hedges, bat they had suffered suffi ciently from the down-ponr of that tropical-like rain to make it very desirable to find some tempo rary (belter. Evil fortune surely had conducted them to the \" Woodman \" inn. \" Highway robbery !\" \"Very good ! Then I advise you, Ogle, and yon, my little man, to give yourselves up to me without more ado.\" \" Alls right 1\" said Ogle. \" Ig it all right ?\" muttered Tom. \" I should say its all wrong.\" Ogle took Tom by the arm, and led him into the inn-yard, whispering as he went, \" Don't be uneasy, Tom Don't yoa know a live dogis better than a dead lion ?\" \" Move hand or foot, and you are corpses !\" yelled Wild again. \" Your piatols, men, yonr pistols! Don't fire, but cover them well I\" Some half-dozen of the men who were with Jonathan Wild presented their pistols at Ogle and Tom Ripon- The coolness and promptitude of action that characterized both of these personages had come back to them, and they had turned to fly. But they saw at the same time what would be the consequences. A volley from Wild and his men. Now, an escape from one pistol, or even from two, hastily aimed in the open air,, might have presented fair chauces enough A volley from six or eight, though all random enongh possibly, but yet filling up a good space, was decidedly dangerous at such close quarters. \" Stop, Tom,\" said Ogle. Tom stopped. He had great faith ia Ogle and what he ad vised. \" What do you mean, Ogle ?\" \" Why, I mean that as long aa we are alive and unhurt we are aU right, and have every chance of getting free.\" \"Oh, ah I yes!\" \" And besides, it's worth while finding out what Jonathan Wild iB about here, and so near to Epping with such a strong party.\" \" To be sure it is, Ogle ; I'm rather glad he has nabbsd us, now you put it in that light How do you do, Johnny ? AU right, old chap ?\" Wild looked furiously at Tom Ripon, but he did not condescend to reply to him. A whispered consultation took place then between Jonathan and Valentine, the officer ; and then t e latter said aloud, \" Very well. Two can be spared easily enough, and well armed as they are, if you pick your men properly, they wiU stand no non sense.\" They both stood as calm and cool as possible by the little gate leading to the inn. Wild stepped forward clear of his hor;e, and still keeping his pistols levelled, he said, \" Yes, Ogle, and you, Tom Ripon, are my prisoners 1\" \" I don't know that jet, Mr. Wild,\" said Ogle.

He seleo'ed two of his ovu men, who be knew perfectly well would stop at no deed of violence for which tbey could see any excuse. Ca9dng his eyes about him then iu the inn yard, he saw the stable into which Daisy and the horse that Oaptain Heron had ridden had been placed by the morose-looking rrroom, who had now dis appeared, and was in hiding somewhere. * Let the prisoners,\" said Jonathan Wild, \" be placed in tbat stable. It'3 good 1 nougb for them, and emoty, as no guests are at the inn.\" Wild then added some injunctions to his men, whioh were quickly obeyed ; aud much to the chagrin of Tom Ripon, although Ogle took the pro ceeding with a calm serenity that specially pro voked Wild, they were tied together by the wrists with a stout cord, and tbeir other hands rather cleverly, by a turn of the game cord, made fast behind their backs. \" And now you can se to swear,\" said Ogle, as he. by stooping down, succeeded in finding a little sliding piece of wood in the stable door that was about large enough to let fowls creep in and out When once, however, that sliding panel on a Brpall scale was removed, sufficient light came into tbe 6table to enable them to see two horses- One was Daisy.

The ost'er remained growl'ng and grumbling, according to his nature, at the stable door, and the janissary still on the outside getting im patient, cried out loudly as he dealt the door a kick, * Hny I what are you about mate ? Come out!\" In about tix minutes both Tom and Ogle weir quite free from the cord. \" Bravo !\" gaid Tom. No reply was made to this appeal, and the janiisarj, for the first time in the transaction, began to feel a slight shock of alarm. He no longer cared for the oatler, but turning his eyes fall to tbe stable door, he was about to say something, when speech wm stopped short on his lips, and he stood like a man suddenly trans formed to gtone. Tbey both listened. \"Hush I\" said Ogle. \" What do you want here ?\" they heard a rough, marling voice say. \" If you only ootne a Uttle closer,\" replied one of Jonathan Wild's men, \" we will let you know.\" Neither Ogle nor Tom Ripon, strangers as they were to that place, were aware that the rough, snarling voice belonged to the ostler of tbe \" Woodmau \" inn. The cause of this phenomenon was amply suffi cient for its production. Tbe atable door was open about a couple of inch\u00b0g, and through that small space there pro jected the muzzles of two p'stols, that seemed to move about in a most mysterious manner, always keeping exactly in a apace that would comprehend the head, faoe, or breast of the janissary. A voice then added to the awkwardness of the situation by raying, \" Move hand or foot, and you are a dead man 1\" \" B<> \u2022 ff with you both,\" he added, \"or perhaps somebody will come to make you.\" \" Don't lose time, old fellow,\" replied one of (be men. \" Send for the somebody at once, will you?\" \" Get out of the way !\" \" Oh, indeed ! And pray what for ?\" \" I want to come into the stable.\" The janissary felt the foU truth of those words. and the hand that had mechanically aought the pocket of hia wide skirted coat, in which he tad a pair of pistols, was allowed quiet'y to drop. \" What's amiss ?\" he said. \" Yon don't say ao 1 May we presume to ask what for?\" \" You might guess, since I am the ostler, and tbat a oouple of horses are there.\" \"Horses, old ohap ! Ha, ha! You mean horsrg on two legg, I suppose.\" The cross- grained ostler was thoroughly angry. \" I don't mean to cay,\" he retorted, * that there may not be horses on two legg, since I gee that there are donkeys \" Tho two myrmidonsof Jonathan Wild laughed .load. They were by no means tbe kind of men to be easily offended by freedom of speeoh, and they were ratber pleased than otherwise at the rough humour < f the ostler. \" Why,\" gaid one, \u25a0 you are just a man after our own heart, yoa are, old one 1\" \"Oh, be off, do I\" \" Not exactly. We would do a good deal to oblige you, but as to being off, that is just what we can't do.\" \" Nothing,' said Ogle, as, with Tom Ripon, he opened the gtable door and stepped out They each had one of the pistols that had beer in the possession of the janissary who was so un ceremoniously pulled into the stable by Ogle. Now the man belonging to Jonathan Wild, who stood alone outside the stable door, waa a man of the world. He knew when he was beaten. Without any special interest in the matter, he \u2022aw no good to himself in throwing hia life away to please Jonathan WUd. So he gave in at once. \" All's right Mr. Ogle,\" he said ; \" yon gain the day. I give in \" The ostler, however, had not the temper of thlg man, and he turned to fly. * Stop,\" cried Ogle ; \" I want you.\" But the ostler had his own suspicions that some of the murderous practice! of the \" Woodman \" inn might possibly come to Ught in rather a dig agreeable manner. Ogle, however, in doubt and uncertainty as he still was about the fate cf Edith and Captain Heron, wag by no means dispoged to let the ogtler escape* \" Then get out of the way.\" \" Well, if there are horses in the stable, we may manage so much as that ; but jugt to make sure, I will go in and see, beoause we have a couple of auinals there that Jonathan Wild rather gets store by.\" This janissary of Wild's gave his companion a sign to be vigilant, and then opening the stable door a few feet he put his head in, calling oat as he did so. \"Hilloa 1 hil.'oa ! you two thieves in there ! Have yon tie gtable all to yourselves, or is there a horse there?\" \u2022 Stop I\" he cried, \" or I fire!\" The ogtler took his chance. He knew the premises well ; and he thought that if he once got into tbe thiok plantation that waa around the house, be might easj baffle pursuit ; but Ogle .va . one of the worst mea in the world to trifle with. \" Come in aud see,\" gaid Ogle. As he spoke, Ogle caught the fellow by tbe throat with a clateh that effectually prevented any breath from passing its thorough'are until be obose to release it and by the same aotion, he pulled him headlong into the stable. The door scung shut \" I have ore ol O'em, Tom,\" whispered Ogle. \" aU's right!\" The janissary who wag still outbids, had, in obedience to the pr vate signal of his comrades, ke^t a sharp eye on the oitler ; and although he oeittinly did hear aa odd sound at the moment that Ogle pulled his comrade into tbe stabla, it was D t sofiLieut to make him think there was any When he called to any one to stop, he meant that they should do so. At the moment then, that the ostler was on the point of disappearing through a hedge, Ogle fired after him. AyeUI The ostler rolled over and over, and then lay still as death on the green-sward. \" Not a bad shot, that\" said Jonathan Wild'j man, quite calmly, and looking t the ogtler wi'b critical eyes, At that moment an awful ory came from tl \u2022 pressing danger. stable."], [14, "8 EDITH HERON. The door was dashed wide open, and out issued Daisy, with the janissary of Wild in custody- Daisy had him by the hair of the head, and bolted out with him as easily as a cat could have done with a mouse. Alas ! how greatly mistaken was poor Edith. The adventures and many hair-breadth escapes that Fe ix Heron had already gone through were destined to be far transcended by those that in the history of his career were yet to coaie; and at the very time when Edith was dreaming of such peace and serenity, circumstances were preparing which were to exercise the greatest influence upon her life. \" Bravo, Daisy I\" oried a voice. Both Ogle and Tom Ripon looked up to a win dow of the \" Woodman \" inn with astonishment for that voice was the best known to them in all the world. The sun was in the west, however, as she and Felix Heron walked thus lovingly side by side among the old trees. 1 he slant beams of the sultry ball of fire in the west, growing each moment more golden and more crimson, shone sweetly through the trees, dappling the green sward on which they trod, with many fanciful colours, so that it rather resembled the parterre of some garden rich in floral beauty, than the mere ordinary grass of the forest glade- Edith spoke. \" My Felix, we shall now know peace. The tumult of your life should surely now be ended, and we should be able to feel that rest and safety belong to us.\" Heron sighed. \" Oh, Felix, why that sigh?\" \" Because, my Edith, you have conjured up a vision which I fear will vanish Uke one 1\" It waa the voice of Oaptain Heron. \" Bravo, Daisy I\" \" Hoorah I shouted Tom Ripon. \" Wb j, Captain,\" gaid Ogle, \" can I believe my eyeg?\" \" Yes, Ogle ; I am all right up here.\" \u201e And Edith \u2014 I beg pardon, I should say the Lady Edith?\" \" I thank you, Ogle, for the first thought of one so dear to me. She is with me, and well \" \" Then I, too, cry out bravo!\" In a few moments, Felix Heron, with Edith and the wounded traveller and hig dear daughter, Lanra, looking so charming in her boy's dress, came down to the lawn. The mystery of the disappearance of Edith and Heron, and the woman of the inn, and Swiney, from the room above, will be evident to the reader, ginoe the gliding secret panel in the old mansion, by which Laura had made her first ap pearance, accounted for all. \"To horse !\u2014 to horse 1\" cried Heron. \"I am convinced that Jonathan Wild is on the road, with the intention to attack us. Quick, Ogle ; get the horses out!\" \u00bb Alas 1 alas 1\" \" Nay, fear nothing, my Edith ; for I have still to geek on the heath and on the road those adven tures which have already made the name of Oaptain Heron famous. I will do so, with a providential care for the life which owes all its value to me that it is dear to you.\" Daisy was prevai'ed upon to let the janissary go, and Edith and Heron were soon again mounted. A couple of horses that belonged to Wild's two men accommodated the wounded traveUer and Laura ; and in another stable Tom Ripon and Ogle found two tolerable steeds, which they did not hesitate to take possession of. \" Off and away !\" cried Heron. \" Across country to Epping, friends all. We will visit this ' Woodman inn,' Ogle, gome other time when we have more leisure !\" Edith started. A hurried footstep sounded close at hand. The low hoot of an owl, as a signal that he who was bo quickly approaching was a friend, sounded mournfully on the evening air. Edith clung close to the arm of Heron, and he called out aloud, \" Who comes ? This way, bird of night and fear no hawks!\" The approaching figure at once emerged from among the trees, and Heron recognised the face and form of Ogle. There was a look of care upon Ogle's face, and yet of that fall and trusting confidence in himself, and in Captain Heron, which never departed from him Both Wild's men were left to do the best they could to join their master, bnt as they were on foot, that wonld be but a slow process. In another hour, Oaptain Heron and his little party reached the outskirts of Epping Forest. That Ogle was the bearer of gome intelligence of a startling character, Heron had a suspicion ; and by a slight sign he warned him not to be too hasty in declaring it before Edith. Ogle quite comprehended him. \" A fine night, Captain,\" he said. \" I thought, perhaps, you wanted to speak to me on some very important business!\" This was Ogle's way of letting Captain Heron know that he had important business to speak of. But Edith was by far too acute and ooservant not to comprehend at once the artifice of these words from Ogle, and she spoke, before Heron could form a reply. \" Do not, Felix, keep from me anything that it is well for you to know. The important business mentioned by Ogle, means danger, and, as such I ought to know it.\" \" You are right, Edith, and shall. Speak out, Ogle, and say what it is!\" Ogle hesitated. From that hesitation there grew, not unnaturally, in the miud of Edith, the opinion that what he had to say was, in truth, more than commonly important. CHAPTER CLXXX. CAPTAIN HERON, ONCE MORE IN SAFETY AT EPPING FOREST, CONCOCTS A NEW PLAN OF OPERATIONS ON THE ROAD. How fair and beautiful old Epping Forest looked beneath the summer's sun 1 How different from the jarring roar and tumult of the city ! Well might Felix Heron and his Edith stroll hand in hand, with rapture, beneath the shadows of the tall old trees, and dream that life passed in that sylvan soUtude would know no paDgs. And Edith, as she now looked lovingly into the eyes of Heron, cherished a hope that the days of his perilous adventures had surely passed away. She thought that henceforth they might be per mitted, in the deep recesses of that wood, to live a life of peace and serenity, undisturbed by the cares of Ufa or its ambitions."], [15, "EDITH HERON. 9 THE LADY ADELA TRELAWNEY. No. 54. \u2014 Edith."], [16, "10 EDITH HERON. And so in truth it was. \"Blow them up!\" \"What?\" Ogle came close to Heron and Edith, and uttered oue word which brought more of a pang to tbe heart of Heron than could any ordinary signifi cation of danger. \" Blow them up, Captain !\" \" No, no.\" \" Well, of course you can do as you please ; but I should place that little keg of gunpowder I had such a difficultv in getting at tbe old powder mills at Bow, in the cave, and in the middle of the affair blow them all up, and so settle it handsomely.\" \" No, Ogle, that will not do ; I will myself as- certain what they intend, and then we will act accordingly. Cheer np, my Edith, and fear no- thing!\" But poor Edith was full of fear. The evening however soon deepened into night, and a dark and blusterous night it became ; for after tbe sun had fairly departed, and not tbe faintest scintillation of twilight was in the western sky, the wind rose, and moaned, and bowled among the old tree tops of Epping Forest. The secrets of the ruins of the priory were not all known to the band of Captain Heron. It was not that he bad any particular distrust of them, for it was rather bis nature to be trustful, and he was oftener inclined to err on the side of too much confidencethantoolittle ; butitbad never occurred that there was any necessity for initiating them into a knowledge of all the secret ways about the huge foundations of the ancient priory. This was. now fortunate, inasmuch as the nar- row and gloomy passages that led underground to the cavern or grotto by tbe spring in tho Forest, from tbe ruins, being only known to Heron himself, afforded a sure and certain mode by which he could come unawares upon those who were about to plot bis destruction. And yet it was with a heavy heart that Heron, at about half- past eleven o'clock on that night, stood in one of the old underground rooms of the ruins, prepared to explore tbe hidden and secret way that led to tbe grotto. Fain would Edith have gone with him, but it was the wish of Heron to go alone, and she saw that wish was so strong that she forbore to urge him to forego it Ogle said not a word, but only waited for orders. The word seemed to find an echo among the old trees ; and as it was uttered, the last ray of the golden sunset died away, robbing the foliage of all its beauty, and leaving the forest cold and desolate. \" Treachery !\" That was the word. \" Oh,\" said Captain Heron, \" you have, indeed, Ogle, found the only word that in all the English tongue can give me uneasiness.\" \" And us too, Captain ; but I have too good reason for what I say.\" \" One of the band, then, is faithless. Is it not so ?\" Ogle shook his head. \"Speak out, then, and say what you really mean. I hope to heaven I am not doomed to hear that some one who is bound to me by no common ties of gratitude, is faithless to me ?\" \" No, Captain, it is not quite so bad as that. Tom Ripon, and old Mortification, and my wife and myself, are all with you the same as ever.\" \" Thank heaven ! Cheer up, my Edith : all well yet be well.\" Edith had turned pale, and was trembling, as she kept close to the side of Heron. It appeared to her that the closer she was to him, the mere safe be was. And now, Ogle, advancing still another step, spoke rapidly. \" Captain, I have had my suspicions of several of the band for some time, and have kept a good watch on them, but it was not until an hour ago that these suspicions became certainties !\" Captain Heron did not speak, but he made a sign for Ogle to go on. \" I was hidingin one of the thickets, where the nut-bushes grow the thickest, and I overheard a ' whispered conversation between twoof tbe rascals, j It was to the effect that they were to hold a meet- ' ing to-night in the old cave or grotto, close to tbe J spring. You know the place well, Captain ?\" \" Yes, yes.\" \" It is where that poor old crazed woman used ' to hide herself, who so long made a home in the I forest.\" Those Captain Heron soon gave him. \" Ogle, it would not be possible for me to lie down to sleep in Epping Forest with the con sciousness that the air was tainted by treachery. If I find f uch to be really the case, we who are here assembled will leave this place together.\" \"Yes, Captain.\" Ogle looked about him as he spoke, as though to take counsel of who it was that would moke up the party. There were himseU and his wife, Tom Ripon and the young girl of whom he had become so deeply enamoured ; the Rev. Mortification ; and there might have been two more persons, but poor Amelia Staunton, the mother of Captain Heron, had passed away to another and a better world, and was at peace ; and Mrs. Ripon had gone to London, to look after, as she said, her property, which she had placed in various secure hiding places, such property consisting of parcels of valuable plate, which she had come by in tbe way of business. But still the party was a pretty large one, and \" I know it well.\" \"To-night, then, Captain, the whole of the ' band, I take it, will meet there, to consider what they shall do.\" \" In what way ?\" \" The intention, so far as I could gather.it, | Captain, was to give you up for a free pardon, and share tbe reward among them.\" A flush of colour came over the face of Captain | Heron, which, however, in the fading evening was not perceptible. But he himseU felt it, and it was with a deep sigh that he said, \" And so this is to be the end \u2014 this tbe severance of the tie that has held me tor so long to these men !\" \" It looks like it, Captain.\" \" Well, Ogle, what shall we do ?\" \" I don't see that we can do anything, Captain, - but the right thing.\" \"And what, Ogle, do you take that right thing ! So be ?\""], [17, "11 EDITH HERON. as Ogle counted them, he said to Heron, \" Cap tain, we shall want all the spare horses.\" u Yes. Ogle, let them bo collected, along with \"Daisy, in the glade that we call the Spanish \"Walk, on account of the Spanish chesnut trees on each side of it.\" \" Ton all know,\" he said, \"that we are not making money. What are we here for, but to make money? What do we care for < '-aptain Heron, or Captain anybody else, if he don't put ns in the way of feathering our own nests ?\" \"Good !\" said one. \" It shall be done, Captain.\" \" And now, dear Edith,\" said Felix Heron, \" I leave you in command of the party, and Ogle will see that all your orders are obeyed. I have bnt one to give.\" Captain Heron spoke in a tone that sufficiently showed the gri\u00abf that sat at his heart. \" Well, I'm glad you all agree to that, for it makes what I am going to add to it come all the easier, you see. I propose that we make a good round sum at once, and begin life all afresh \u2014 after we have spent it !\" The orator paused at this point, in the hope that some of his audience would say something to break a little the harshness and cold-blooded treachery of the proposal which was on his lips. But no one spoke. \" Well,\" he added, \" since you will make me say it, I have co objection. What I propose is, that we all share and share alike, which will give us hard on to a hundred pounds each, sf we give up the Captain.\" There was an uneasy movement among the band, and yet each man had perfectly well known what was coming. \" If that's agreed,\" added the spokesman, '' no thing will be easier than to make terms with the beaks in London.\" Edith clung to his arm as he spoke, and he added sadly, \"You all know the sound of the silver bugle horn that I have usually about me, and which I have always said I would never breathe into except at times of emergency ?\" \" Yes, yes.\" ''Then if you hear two notes upon that, mount aad ride at once down the glade, and be assured I sh? II soon meet you all.\" iidith turned, and took from the arms of the young girl (Tom's flame) the Httle child, and held its soft baby face up to the lips of Heron. He left a kiss upon the fair young brow, and then another upon the cheek of Fdith. \" Be brave, my Edith. This is but a passing cloud, from which we shall emerge into a bright sunshine yet ; for the light in which we live, it appears, is the false one of treachery.\" \" But the pardon?\" said one. \" Well, that's whrt I mean. It must be a free pardon, aud a hundred pounds a man. Not a penny less, I should say, and no sort of going back from the terms of the pardon. Then, you see, we shall start afresh in the world, wilb some thing to enjoy ourselves with.\" CHAPTER CLXXXI. \"Agreed! \u2014 agreed !\" they all cried, one after the other. The leader counted this word, repeated ten times in different voices, and then, dark as it was, he felt satisfied that he had the assent of all pre sent. CAPTAIN nERON SURPRISES THE PLOTTERS, AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE FROM EPPING FOREST TO LONDON. The hour of midnight has como. From the thickets and bushes, and from the But little did he suspect, or they suspect, the auditor they had. Felix Heron was at the hack of the cavern, having entered it by the subterranean way, and he had heard all thaf passed. It was with a faint sigh of regret that he felt now quite satisfied that the old forest, where he had passed so many happy hours, was no longer tenable for him and his. deep shadows of the tall old trees in the immediate neighbourhood of the grotto by the spring in the forest, there emerge dim and dusky figures, which, as by one accord, make their way towards tbe grotto. With the exception of those persons whom we left in the foundations of the old priory ruins, every living soul in the forest assembled in the grotto. The scouts upon the outskirts of the wood left their posts. But his mind was made up previously. He controlled the desire he had to walk forth into the midst of those men, and ask them what he had done that they should betray him. With a wiser decision and a calmer judgment he let them take their own course, and he made his way back through the gloomy passages. The prowlers, as those of the band were called whose duty it was to keep watch and ward about the old forest glades, no longer peered out from amid the nut-bushes or the tangled brambles. Heron had secreted in the recesses of the old ruins of the priory considerable treasure, and he felt quite certain that there it might be safely left until he chose to bring it forth ; and it pleased him to think that it was there as a resource for Edith and the little one in case destiny should snatch him from them. All obej'ed the summons to the meeting in the grotto. They had no light. No one could see the other, but one name \u2014 it was that, probably, of the one who had set this treacherous combination in motion \u2014 spoke in a low tone. \" Let each one here present,\" he said, \" proclaim his number.\" Ogle and >dith herself, aTong with Captain Heron, only knew of the secret repository of we;dth in the wood. This was done to the extent of thirteen. But with all this, it was with a feeling very nearly akin to desolation of the^ heart, that Cap tain Heron felt the neceesity of making up his mind to part with those familiar scenes in the, old forest that had so long been a resting-place That was, excepting Ogle and Torn Kipun, the exact number of Captain Heron's band. Then, looking like dim and silent ghosts, they listened to the man who was leading them from the faith they had all pledged to Captain Heron."], [18, "12 EDITH HI_?.OX. and a haven of security and peace for him and his. But all was not to pass over so peaceabl}- as Heron imagined. That parting, however, had to take place, and the reader will please to imagine Felix Heron, with Edith, making such brief and hasty prepa rations as were necessary for the purpose. But where were they to go ? Where were they to find such another refuge as Epping Forest ? Alas ! nowhere to the same extent of security or pleasure in occupation. Edith looked sadly in the face of Heron, and although she did not in so many words ask the question, yet her looks plainly enough said, 11 Whither shall we go ?\" And Felix replied to those looks. \"Edith,\" he said, \" let us look for the safety we want, even in what shall seem the midst of danger.\" Itwanted abouttwenty minutes to twelve, when Tom Kipon, who had been out among the old trees bordering, one of the glades, came back to the ruins of the priory with rather startling intelli gence. \"Captain,\" he said, \"I don't know what to make of it exactly, but I have seen, at one opening out of the wood, some men on horseback, and they don't belong to the band !\" \" Indeed, Tom!\" \" Yes, Captain ! I crept close to two of them, and I heard one say to tbe other, that he should give it up if the governor did not come soon.\" M Ogle,\" cried Heron. \" Here, Captain.\" \" The wood is getting beleagured, I feel con vinced. Let us start at once.\" \"More danger, Felix ?\" \" No, dear one, I hope more safety. There ia an old fable of a lamb who, fancying that it was about to become tbe prey of a wolf who was prowling a forest in search of it, strayed into a gloomy cavern, where it found security until the hunters came into the wood, and slew the wolf \u2014 that cavern being the wolf's lair.\" \" All right, Captain.\" \" Edith, are you prepared even now, this mo ment, for the night ride to London ?\" \" Yes \u2014 oh, yes \u2014 this moment.\" Edith caught the child from its little bed, and wrapped it in one of her mantles. The party were all collected at the extremity of one of the narrow entrances to the old ruins, and Ogle was in the act of making a way for the horses by pulling up some shrubs tbat he had only that day loosened in the soil, so that they would yield to a vigorous effort, when they were all startled by the loud clear note of a bugle. Ogle paused abruptly. Heron held up his band for silence, and by the dim light of one lantern, which was in the care of the Kev. Mortification Eipon, they all main tained their various attitudes, and waited for what might foUow the bugle note. \" Yes, Felix, I see, you would say, we will seek for safety somewhere that shall seem so dangerous that no one will dream of there looking for us.\" \" Just so, Edith.\" \"And where shall that be?\" \" I propose that it be in our town house in St. James's Street.\" \"Whitcombe House?\" \"Even so, Edith. There can be no doubt that it is completely deserted ; and I should hardly think that even our arch enemy, Jonathan Wild, would look for us there.\" ___. confused sound arose from the depths of the wood. \" Be it as you wish, Felix.\" Edith shuddered. A shout \u2014 a kind of triumphant hurrah from many voices. Her recollection flew back to the terrible agony she had endured from the visit of her brother at that house, and she had a dread of again taking up her abode even in secrecy in its chambers. \" This shall not be done, my Edith,\" added Heron, \" if it be repugnant to you ; but it has advantages \u2014 one of them, and not the least, being that you will be sufficiently near to your dear aunt, Lady Castleneau, that, if much pressed by any danger, her mansion in Bloomsbury Fields would be a refuge speedily attainable.\" \" Yes, Felix \u2014 yes, you are right. We will go to Whitcombe House.\" Ogle spoke hastily. \" Captain, I have it. Those rascals have been more prompt than we thought ; and no doubt is in my mind but that bugle call has let them know of the arrival of a force to help them in their villany.\" \" Then,\" said Heron, \" we are in danger.\" \" But that, Captain, is not exactly the kind of word to scare us.\" \" No\u2014 but \" \" Never despair, Captain !\" added Ogle. \" All's well that ends well ; and I think we can contrive to hold our own in spite of these rascals.\" \"Hush!\" Felix Heron, in concert with Ogle, soon had all in readiness for starting. Again the bugle note sounded clearly and dis tinctly through the wood. This time it was echoed, or, at all events, im mediately succeeded, by a strange shout from Mortification Kipon. \" Yea, murder ! I fear the Philistines are upon us ! Yea ! Oh, dear, what is this ?\" From his neck, where it had slightly grazed his skin, but chiefly spent its force amid the folds of a huge cravat be had lately taken to wear, the Kev. Mortification extracted an arrow. Daisy and several other horses were ready sad dled and bridled for the road. Tom Kipon was quite in his glory, for he looked upon a residence in London as affording a scope for his abilities that no wood, or forest, or country place could possibly present. The night was creeping on, and as Heron could not tell exactly what steps the treacherous band might take to his detriment, he resolved that as the midnight hour had come, he and his little party would start for the metropolis. Heron calculated that in two hours they would easily reach London ; and as it would then be two o'clock in the morning, the streets would be in their most deserted condition. \" Yea, what can this mean \" \" Silence !\" cried Heron. \" Ogle, see to this \u2014 it means more than it looks.\" \" I think so, too, Captain, for here is a letter of some sort wound round the shaft of the arrow.\""], [19, "EDITH HERON. 13 \" Hold the lantern here, Mortification.\" \"Yea, I will.\" Heron carefuUy unfolded the strip of paper that was wound round the arrow, aud read as follows : \u2014 we separate, we shall each of us be a prey to so much pain and anxiety about the other that we shaU be unable to cope with events that may call upon us for action. No, no, a thousand times, no ! We will not \u2014 must not separate !\" Felix Heron was fain to comply. He was full of admiration for the feeling that prompted Edith, while at the same time he was full of pain for her safety. I, Jonathan Wild, beg to inform all whom it \u00ab.ay concern, that I don't mean to harm or in terfere with any one in the forest but Felix Heron, the highwayman ; and him I mean to have, so I advise that he be given up quietly, or worse will come of it.\" A scuffling noise was heard now at some dis tance off in the wood. \"Help, oh, help!\" A voice raised tbe shout, whicli, by its tones, seemed to belong to some one in the last extre mity of evil fortune. \" Is that all, Captain ?\" asked Ogle. \" Yes, that is all.\" Edith crept closer still to Felix. He smiled as he looked upon her, and spoke : \" Well, my Edith, this is but what we expected, and brings, at all events, no more danger.\" \" Yea,\" said Mortification, \"it hath brought me a scratch in the neck that is unpleasant, for, as the Psalmist says \" \" Never mind the Psalmist just now, Mortifi cation,\" said Heron. \" Ogle, I want you to see to a little matter at once.\" Then all was still. \" Yes,\" said the Rev. Mortification, \" our friend Ogle hath captured a Philistine, or a Philistine hath captured him.\" \" Hush !\" said Heron. \" Don't be an elderly goose, father-in-law,\" said Tom Kipon. \" Ogle is not the sort of chap, I can tell you, for any what-do-you-call him to get hold of.\" \" Yea, I \" \" Silence !\" cried Heron, sharply ; \" some one \" Yes, Captain.\" \" Go and catch one of the band if you can, and we will make him tell us what is exactly ex pected to happen. Ogle laughed. comes.\" An odd, scuffling noise was apparent among the shrubs and bushes. Then it assumed the character of some wild animal in want of water and breathing hard. The Kev. Mortification at once got behind Tom. \" Ye.\", Captain, that will be the plan. It will go hard but I come back with one of the rascals at tbe end of a noose.\" What Ogle meant to do was sufficiently appa rent by the little hasty preparation he made. That consisted in making a noose at the end of a rope about six or eight yards long, and, with that coiled up in his bands, like the lasso of the South American hunters, he went out from the covert of the ruins into the wood to make a pri soner. \" Ogle,\" cried Captain Heron. \" Here you are, Captain !\" \" As quick as I can, Captain ; but he pretends he can't walk.\" \" Who is it ?\" \"Number Eight!\" Ogle at this moment made his appearance with what looked like a huge bundle on bis shoulder, and cast it down at tbe feet of Captain Heron. It was impossible to divest the present state of things of a feeling of considerable anxiety, al though, if Felix Heron had been alone in tbe forest, it would have cost him not one moment's thought or preparation to decide on what to do. He would just have mounted Daisy, and then sallied forth and made an end of the whole af fair by a gallop out of the forest. CHAPTER CLXXXII.

The object that Ogle cast down at the feet of Captain Heron was most undoubtedly human. It uttered various half-choked moans and grunts, and rolled about in rather an eccentric fashion. Edith and the little child. It was no time for rash adventures when their safety was the question at issue. The silence that ensued while Ogle was gone on the somewhat hazardous aud strange expedi tion was unbroken save by a few low whispered words between Edith and Felix Heron. \"Ah !\" said Ogle, composedly, \" I dare say the noose is rather tight round his neck. He would try to get out of it, and that made it worse.\" \"Release him,\" said Heron, \"or we shall get no information from him.\" \" My Edith,\" he had said, \" I wish you to mount Daisy, and take charge of the little one, so that whatever happens you will have no great difficulty in riding to your aunt's house in Lon don.\" Ogle loosened the noose, which in truth was so tight rouud the neck of that traitorous mem ber of Captain Heron's band that he could not speak. \"No !\" was the whispered response of Edith. \u25a0\" no, Felix ; we will go together, or not at aU.\" \" Nay, Edith, do not say so.\" \" I must, indeed.\" \" You unnerve me.\" And even then he was in anything but a good condition to comprehend what was required of him. \" He is half-choked !*' said Heron ; \" give him some water, Tom Ripon.\" \"Theie you are!\" said Tom, as he flung a pad full of water, tbat had been brought to that Edith grasped bis band in tears. \" Do not you, Felix, unncive me by using such words.

The light increased each moment. A sensation of heat even began to be felt, and now and then a rolling column of smoke made its way to where they stood. The shock did more to rouse the half-hanged wretch than probably anything else could have done. \"Now you know all,\" added the treacherous Number Eight. \" We all know, and Jonathan AVild knows, that you have hiding-places in the old ruins here that might baffle him, and so he intends to make them too hot to hold you.\" \" So,\" said Felix Heron, \" that is the plan, is it?\" He sat up at once. He uttered a loud cry of terror and surprise. Ogle then clapped the muzzle of a pistol to his forehead, just between the eyes, as he said, \" Another such cry as that, and you are a dead man !\" \" It is.\" Heron glanced about him for a few seconds, and then he cried out to Ogle, \" Mount at once, Ogle \u2014 mount at once ! We wUl ride through the great glade.\" \" Stop a bit,\" said Number Eight. ' ' The great glade has a strong party of Jonathan Wild's men in it, and there you will be nabbed. I don't ad vise you to go that way.\" \"No,\" said Ogle ; \" because you want us to be baked alive in the old priory ruin6.\" \" ft would be quite a pity,\" said Number Eight, \" certainly, if tbings did not go on as they were' meant.\" \" Mercy !\" \" That's as it may turn out !\" \"Oh, oh! I'm a dead man !\" \"Not quite ; but you will be in a few minutes, I dare say!\" Then Captain Heron stepped forward, and spoke in deep, earnest tones, tbat struggled with the natural iudignatiou he felt at the treachery of one whom he bad trusted. \" What had I done to you,\" he said, \" or what had I left undone, that you should seek to betray me to my enemies ?\" The traitor was silenced. \" So it would,\" oaid Heron, \u2014 \" so it would !\" \" What do you mean, Captain ?\" asked Ogle. \" Just this, Ogle \u2014that I always meant to hang any of the band who turned a traitor, and this one shall not escape the just doom !\" \" All right, Captain ! Help, Tom !\" \" Yes, Ogle !\" \" Just take the end of the rope, and run up this tree with it.\" \" You cannot answer either of those questions, I know,\" added Heron; \"but there are others that you can aud shall answer.\" Still the man did not speak. \" What force has Jonathan WUd in and about the wood ?\" Still no reply. \" Very well ! Ogle ?\" \"Yes, Captain !\" Tom saw what Ogle intended, and he went up a chesnut tree with the agility of a monkey, car rying the end of the rope with him. Then Ogle lifted tbe man as high as his arms would let him, whUe Tom fastened the rope round a stout bough of the tree. Number Eight uttered a yeU of fear and de spair. \" Hang this fellow ; it is quieter than a pistol shot !\" \" All's right, Captain !\" Ogle gave the noose a pull, which made it feel disagreeably tight again about the neck 'of Num ber Eij^ht ; and he saw that if he would save his life be must needs teU aU that was required of Him. \" Help ! murder ! Oh, help ! They are hang ing me! They are going to hang me !\" \"No,\" said Ogle, as he let him go, \" they are not going to hang you \u2014 they have done it !\" With a jerk, the traitor fell to the extremity of the rope, and wheu there his toes were actuaUy within three inches of the ground. Thuse three inches, by the tension of the rope, gradually lessened ; but before the cord had given out sufficiently that the toes of Number Eight actually touched the green sward beneath them, he was a dead man. \" Let me go when I have made a clean breast of it, and will tell you all.\" \" No,\" said Heron, \" we make no conditions with a fellow like you. TeU all, or die.\" \" Say on, then. What am I to teU you, Captain ?\" \"What force has Jonathan WUd in and about the wood ?\" \" Tweuty-five men.\" \" And are you all traitors \u2014 you, I mean, who couip-'sed my band?\" \"Ab!\" While this Uttle act of retributive justice was being enacted, Captain Heron had placed Editb upon the back of Daisy. She held the child in her arms, and Heron him seU, as he patted the neck of his gallant steed, spoke to it encouragingly. \" My noble Daisy, you will carry this night your master, whom you love with all your honest heart, and aU whom he holds dearest in this world !\" Heron sighed. \" And what is the plan of operations?\" \u25a0'Look!\" \"Ab!\" A si range light began to show itself in dif ferent parts of the old forest.

On, Daisy, on ! On, for three lives and your own, my gallant Daisy !\" A half-burnt tred fell exactly in the way. Daisy, with one leap, cleared, the obstacle. The other horses followed, and then Jonathan Wild raised a yell of rage, for he saw that all hie schemes for the capture of Felix Heron in Epping Forest had resolved themselves into a mere chase out of it, and along the high road to London. He was mounted on a powerful black horse, and as he struck the spurs deep into the flanks of the startled animal, he shouted aloud, \" My own share of the reward be the man's who captures or kills Felix Heron! Follow ! follow I\" The rest of the party had managed to get mounted as best they could. Tom Bipon waa supremely happy, because he had behiud him, with her arms, for safety's sake, round his waist, the young girl whom he had fallen so head over years in lovu with since she had been rescued from death at Tyburn by Captain Heron. Ogle rode alone, and Mrs. Ogle was fain to sit behind the Itev. Mortification Kipon, who mut tered to himself, \" Yea, a man might be safe enough against ihe bullets that perad venture will Boon fly about like hailstones in May, if he had one other such extensive female before him as I have now behind me.\" With these words Wild dashed onwards in pursuit of Heron and his party, who were now getting rapidly clear of the wood. Daisy was rather overweighted. With Heron alone she would have taken tne gallop to London, and thought nothing of it. About a mile from the forest he saw, coming along a cross road, obliquely towards him, a chariot. tk Get un, du !\" said Mrs. Ogle. It was scarcely to be supposed that Jonathan Wild had not in suine measure prepared himself for the contingency of a start of this character on the part of Captain Heron. He must have known that in all probability the boldest course out of tho difficulties that sur rounded him would be that which would recom mend itself more particularly to Heron. A couple of good horses, one of which was ridden by a postilion, drew it. An idea at once darted into the mind of Heron, \"Edith,\" he said, \u2014 \"dear Edith, for my sake, and your own, and for the sake of our dear child, I propose that we separate for a short time.*' \"Oh, Felix, FeUx!\" An encounter, therefore, was to be expected. Over the brushwood, then, Daisy, guided by the skilful hand of Felix Heron, went : not a mo ment could be Calculated upon that might not bring them face to face with Wild and his party. Yes, surely now the alarm is given. \" Nay, dear one, think nothing of it ! You see that cariage approaching ?'' \"Yes, Felix\u2014 yes!\" \" I will ride up to it, and ask its occupant to afford you and our child a refuge.\" There was no time for further parley on the subject. The carriage rapidly approached, and Heron dashed up to the side of it. \" Halt !\" he cried to the postiUon. \" Pull up, I say !\" \" Oh, Lord ! \u2014 a highwayman, as sure as my name is Peter!\" cried tbe postUion. The sound, rapid aud continuous, of a bugle is in the wood. At the momeut that its echoes are awakened, Daisy, with her precious treble burden, emerges iuto one of the open glades of the forest. What a beautif nl sight that glade was ! One side of it was in flames. But now there is a shout of triumph from Jonathan Wild ! He is there ! But he stopped his horses abruptly Heron looked into the chariot. By some fiendish calculation, he has surmised that that would be the route Heron would choose if he attempted to gallop out of the forest. \" Yield yield !\" he shouted. \" Not a hair of the head of any one shall be injured, if FeUx Herou yields himseU a prisoner!\" This had no inducement to any one to stop. They all dashed onward. \" Fire !\" cried Wild. \" Thank heaven !\" he said. He uttered that ejaculation because he saw a lady alone in the vehicle. \" Madam,\" he said, in tones of emotion, \" will it please you to do an act of charity and goodnest to tw,\u00bb innocent souls ?\" \" What do you mean ?\" asked the lady, whe was both young and handsome. She leant forward as she spoke, and then Editb cried, \" It is the Lady Trelawney, the sister of Colonel Trelawney, or I am much mistaken.\" \" Yes,\" said the lady, \" that is my name ; and can it be possible that I see the Earl and the Countess of Whitcombe ?\" A rolling discharge of pistols took place. If any oue was hurt, it was not by a cry or a pause that Jonathan Wild had the gratification of knowing it, the Uttle cavalcade swept past like an ftp ton ! \" Fire !\" \" Yes !\" said Heron; \"and the Lord Warring dale.\" Agaiu the voico of Wild rose with the mur derous command above all other sounds. Another voUey of pistol-shots flew after the fu, a i ves. Heron thought that some sharp piece of twig Croui oue of the trees had struck his shoulder. Edith started at the sound of that name, foi it had never yet occurred to her that such was the title which, by courtesy, her own child was entitled to. i i bullet that just furrowed up the skin. \" Editb, Edith I\" The Lady Trelawney, too, had heard quite enough from her brother, the Colonel, of Lord"], [22, "16 EDITH HERON Warringdale, not to be in any way desirous of his company. far better chances of escape from the large party that pursued him if he were left quite alone. And now that Edith and the child werein safety, there was no further cause for anxiety. \"Come on, Tom,\" said Ogle. \"The deuce take the hindmost ! Come on !\" A very few words, however, sufficed to rectify the mistake into which the mere pronunciation of the name of Warringdale had plunged both Edith and Lady Trelawney. \" Ah, yes !\" said Edith ; \" my son is entitled to that name, which has been usurped by one in every way wholly unworthy of it.\" \" I don't agree with you there,\" said Tom. \" The hindmost, as far as I am concerned, is the prettiest girl in all the world, and you won't get me to hand her over to the deuce, I can tell you.\" Ogle laughed, but all conversation was quickly put an end to by tho pace at which they sped on- wards to the metropolis. And so it was that Captain Felix Heron was alone on the high road. Alone with Daisy. It was quite like old times revived again ; and he felt tbat he had only to cry \" Stand and de- liver\" to some passenger on the highway, to be as he had been years gone by, when the thought of ever calling Edith his own was but a dream. Not for long, however, was Captain Heron able to indulge in any fanciful mood. Jonathan Wild and his party came on at a thundering pace. They were all pretty well mounted, for Wild had well calculated his chances of success and failure in regard to the enterprise. \" Yes, Edith,\" added Captain Heron, \" you and I will never forget the right that our child has to rank with the nobility of the land.\" \"No one,\" said Lady Trelawney, \" will wil lingly forget it, who wishes for justice. My brother, who is so intimate a friend of the Earl of Bridgewater, has told me over and over again of the great injustice and- wrong which has been done to the Earl and Countess of Whitcombe.\" \" Then, madam,\" said Heron, \" you grant my request, and will afford an asylum in your car riage to the Countess and our son ?\" \" Willingly.\" \" Edith, you are saved !\" \" And you, FeUx ?\" \" I, too !\" \" You come with us ?\" \" Not so, dear Edith. I only meant to say that I, too, was saved, and by the same means. Lady Trelawney, by taking you and the child, will enable me to distance Jonathan Wild and his gang.\" Felix Heron stood like tbe statue of a man and horse, exactly in the centre of the road. There was a portion of that highway which was raised somewhat like the crown of an arch, and in fact it was so, on account of a watercourse that ran beneath. As Captain Heron spoke, the sound of a bugle came upon the night air, and he knew that his foes were close at hand. \" Quick, dearest Edith,\" he said, \" if you would save us all !\" It was on the very apex of this raised part of the road that Felix Heron stood with Daisy. The knight was dark. But it was not so dark that his figure, and that of his horse, might not be seen against the night shade in sufficient reUef to make no doubt of what they were. Edith at once dismounted, and was instantly safely bestowed in the carriage along with the Lady Trelawney. \" On, on, now,\" said Heron ; \"on to London, and take no notice of me !\" And as he waited there for the space of about one minute and a half, a sense of bitterness and irritation came over him that he should be so relentlessly hunted by Jonathan Wild. Edith waved her hand from the carriage win dow, and then the vehicle started again, although the postilion was in such a state of bewilderment in regard to what had happened, that he hardly knew whether he was in the clutches of a high wayman or not. Daisy, then, lightened of the load she carried, made two of her bounds, by which she testified tbat she was ready for any extraordinary exer-r tion that might be required of her bv he master. Hunted like some wild animal from hie beau tiful sylvan home in the forest of Epping. Drawing from the holster of his saddle one of the pistols that Ogle had taken good care should be placed there, properly charged, he presented it at the advancing form of Jonathan Wild. \" Who knows,\" he said, \" but chance or provi dence may direct this bullet to the destruction of that fiend in human shape, who can be anything but precious in the sight of heaven ?\" As the cavalcade, with Wild at their head, turned the corner of the road which would at once briug them into the sight of Captain Heron he levelled the pistol. \" Ah, I see him !\" shouted Jonathan Wild Bang! The pistol was discharged at the same mo ment, and the report mingled with the echoes of Wild's voice. Captain Heron felt a sense of security and ease now that for the past half-hour had been a stranger to h's breast. \" No, Daisy, no,\" he said. \"Not yet, my own gallant Daisy ! We will let the villain Jonathan Wild see us before we start on the road to Lon don again.\" The object of Heron was to draw off effectuaUy from all observation of Lady Trelawney, Jona than Wild and his men. To do that effectually, it was only necessary that Jonathan should get a fair sight of him. \" Kide on, Ogle !\" said Heron to those who were with him. \" Kide on, and get to town as quickly as you can. Let me find you in the street that runs from St. James's Street, close to Whitecombe House.\" Then there was a yell. A scene of confusion ensued, and Heron thought Wild was down. Then he gave Daisy the rein, and off he went. \" Hurrah !\" he shouted. \" All right, Captain.\" Ogle knew perfectly well that Felix Horon had Was Jonathan Wild killed by that chance shot ?"], [23, "EDITH HERON. irl That wag the anxious question that Felix Heron put to himself, and it was one that he would have been glad to get answered one way or the other. There were no means, however, at that time, of aolving it, and he could only gallop on. \" I have tried to hang him,\" he said, \" and I jave tried to shoot him ; and still, as if he had a charmed life, he lives. Heron, and one by one he made a careful exami nation of the feet of Daisy. Yes, it was as he fancied. She had east a shoe. Any idea of proceeding on to the stony road, which he well knew almost immediately sur rounded, the common on which he had made this unwelcome discovery, was out of the question. Heron stood by the side of Daisy in doubt what to do. From the clatter of horses' feet in the wood after him, Felix Heron was led to the belief that the pistol-shot had not b en effectual as against Jonathan, considering, as he did, tbat if it had been so the puriuit would have been given up for want of a leader. By the dim leaden-coloured light that began to show itself in the eastern sky, he managed to see the face of his watch. It was half-past four in the morning. In another half-hour he knew that the dawn Daisy made little of the distance to London. The house-tops of the City, if it had been day- tght, wonld already have been seen from a little common that had to be passed, when, to the sur prise of Heron, Daisy slightly stumbled. To dismount was the work of an instant to wonld be making rapid progress- It was necessary, therefore, that whatever he did should be done quickly, or he would not reach London by any hour that would make it safe for him to take refuge at Whitcombe House. No. 55 \u2014 Edith. I"], [24, "18 EDITH HERON that the pistol shot he had sent on aohance errand among his pursuers had, at all events, whatever other mischief it might have done, Hot kUled Wild. \" No,\" said Heron to himself, as with the bridle of Daisy upon his arm he looked about him in the quiet village, \u2014 \"no, the vUlain is born to suffer on the gallows, whither he has consigned so many persons both innocent and gnUty, and by no other mortal means oan he be bronght to death.\" The delajs of one kind and another on the road had eaten into the night in an extraordinary manner, and he had not, until he held the face of his watch towards the east to look at it, imagined it to be so late by a good hour. Mount his disabled horse he would not ; and it was with something Uke a foreboding of danger that he led Daisy along the narrow bridle-way of the common. From frequently traversing the road, Heron knew that in the hollow immediately past the common there lay a Uttle vUlage of about twenty houses only. One of those houses had, as a matter of course, at the lower part of it a smithy. Adjoining that smithy was a mill, so that the miller was a smith Ukewise, carrying on both the trades, as occasion required. Heron's idea was to rouse up this man, and get him, by the promise of some nnnsual payment, to light his forge fire, and put a new shoe on Daisy. All this would take time, but there was in reality no other resource, since to gallop Daisy right into London with one shoe off might lame her for months. Hark! A new sonnd. New and straDge too. It breaks the stillness of the village, which was so like death. A sound like the rushing of a clond on its pas sage over the qniet spot, by some suddenly sprung np gale of wind. And yet the air blew but lightly, nevertheless Heron had become aware that for the last few hours a kind of breeze, in a fitful manner, was graduaUy getting up. Daisy was startled at the odd sound. At one moment it was like wind, and then like water, and then like the passage through the air of a flock of huge birds. What could it be ? A man's voice broke the stillness of the viUage. That was not to be thought of. As yet, nothing could be heard of his foes, for Heron had fairly galloped at very nearly the top of Daisy's speed for a few miles, and distanced them completely. Indeed, he had a hope that the road he had come was not the one which they had chosen. If so, aU would be well. He took Daisy by the bridle, and led her care fully over the common through the darkness, which seemed just then to be increasing instead of diminishing. But Heron knew that that was a common phenomenon just before the dawn fairly began to show itself. \" Oh, the miller is a jolly wight \u2014 A jolly wight is be ; He lets the wind do all his work, While he is singing free!\" \" Hilloa!\" cried Heron. \" HUloa I ti you ; hiUoa ! \" was the prompt reply. * Are yon the miller ?\" \" Mayhap I am ; and if yon were to say ' Are yon the smith ?' I shonld make the same answer ; for as the old song goes : \" The smith he is a mighty man- Clank I clank t goes the anvil ; He drinks deep from the flowing con, CHAPTEK CLXXXIII.

Do yon wear shoes of my make, my friend ?\" CArTAES HERON MBETS WITH AN ADVENTURE OF DANGER AT THE OLD SMITHY. The distance across the common to the little vUlage in the hoUow was something short of a quarter of a mile. It waa an anxious distance, though, to Felix Heron As he went, he kept his tense of hearing painfully on the stretch to catch the slightest sonnd whioh should be indicative of the approach of his foes. \"Come! come! no trifling. My horse is here, and she does.\" \" Your horse, and yon call him she ?\" \" Yes, a mare is but a female horse, as you ought to know.\" It was a consolation to hear nothing of them, aad in the course of about eight or nine minutes, Heron and his poor half-lamed Daisy reaohed the little cluster of houses that, by courtesy, were caUed a village How still and wrapt in repose they all were I If that little hamlet had been only inhabited by the dead, it wonld have been impossible for it to be more profoundly still than it was. Heron halted. \" Then is a woman bnt a female man ; so I will put on the shoe at once.\" \"Have it aU your own way,\" said Heron ; \"only be quick about it, and yon shaU have a guinea for your pains.\" \" Then you are one of two things !\" \"What things?\" \" A lord or a highwayman I\" \" Both 1 both ! \" cried Felix Heron, as ha foUowed the smith into the smithy by the light of a lantern, which the humourist had lighted hastily. At some distance off in the track he had come he heard the faint sound of horses' feet. He knew that those who sought his life were not far from the spot. He knew that the villain Wild, whose hatred of him had got to that pitch tbat it transcended even his love cf monev, was intent npon his murder. By that time Heron had quite made up his mind \" Come on, then \u2014 I like a frank fellow like yon ; and if I charge yon a single groat for your horse's shoe, why I am not John Brown, the jolly miller and smith of Little Hampton I\""], [25, "19 EDITH HERON. \" Tell me,\" said Heron, \" what strange noise is that I hear ia the air?\" tant part of the smithy, and was in oomplete hiding in the darkness of the old, spacious place.

In an other, cart-wheels and old home furniture were piled np almost to the soot-begrimed roof. The forge and all its appurtenances occupied a considerable space ; and the smith, as he held up the lantern to look at Heron, pnt on a strange ex pression, and nodded his head. \" Ah,\" he said, \"you are in a harry ?\" \" I am.\" \" The buU-dogs are after you ?\" \" They are.\" \" Now, my friend, what would you say to trust ing me with your name?\" \" I mean to do.

Do be quiet!\" Tap, tap, tap ! went the smith at his work. \" Yon are \u00bb merry feUow,\" said Wild. \" Where's your fire, Mr. Smith ?\" \" Here.\" The farrier stirred np hia forge fire, which had been damped down over night with a heap of wet, small coal, and as he gave bis bellows two or three puffs, the bright flames began to roar and orackle. But he took good care to keep between the party of Jonathan WUd and Daisy. \" How long have you been at work ?\" asked Wild. \" About thirty odd years.\" \" Tush, tush ! I mean this morning.\" \" Oh, about half an hour.\" \" Then yon can say if a man has ridden through the village?\" \" Yes I can ; and yes I can say to it.\" \"Did he go fast?\" \"Like mad!\" The smith was too good a judge of horses not to see by a very casual inspection that it could be no other than the veritable Daisy who stood be fore him in the smithy. \" Beautiful \u2014 beautiful !\" he cried. \" My gracious, what a bead and eyes she has I She looks at one like a Christian !\" \" Better than many who call themselves by that title,\" said Heron, bitterly. The farrier put down his hand to lift Daisy's foot, but it was not until Captain Heron said to her, \" Up, Daisy \u2014 up, up,\" that she would allow it to be lifted. \" Now, for the love of heaven, be quick,\" said Heron, \" for I am pursued by Jonathan Wild, and he will be here in five minutes more.\" \" Ah 1\" \" Yes ; I was just setting my mill sails to the morning air. Why, fast! \u2014 he came on a black, or a very dark bay, horse, that seemed not to touoh the ground, but to skim over it like a shadow I\" \"Confound him!\" muttered Wild. \" Yes,\" said the smith. \"'A can of ale\u2014 a can of ale 1 *' \" Hold your row, do!\" cried Wild. \"Eh?\" \" I say, hold that row.

That a similar accident should have happened to the horse of Jonathan Wild to that which, for the time being, had disabled Daisy, was one of the most provoking things in the world. The smith was rather staggered at tbe coinci dence, and could hardly believe it to be true. \" Your horse cast a shoe ? \" he said. \"Come on, laggards,\" shouted a harsh voice, which there was no mistaking as belonging to any one but Jonathan Wild. \" Come on I I am cer tain that he has come this way !\" The olatter of other horses' feet in the little quiet street of the village showed that WUd's party had joined him, and tbat they were in force. \" Hide I\" said the smith. \" Yes, idiot ; why not ? Did you never hear of such a thing as that happening before ?\" \" Yes, and believed, toe,\" said the smith, promptly. \" I'U soon put that all to rights for yon- Dobbin can wait\" The smith pushed Daisy farther on into the darkness and shadow of the old smithy, for ii the eyes of WUd had only happened to be cast for half a minute npon her he could not have failed to reccgniEe her as the redoubtable Daisy. But owing to not the remotest suspicion on tbe gnbject crossing his mind, be did not pay the least atteniion to Daisy, farther than seeing that it was something in the _haj>e of a hers*. \" Take care of Daisy.\" \" Leave that to me.\" \"Quiet, Daisy, quiet!\" Heron patted her on the neck, and then taking the hand of the smith, he let Daisy see that he placed it on her neck. After that Heron was quite sure tbat she would look upon the smith as a friend and a person to be trusted. Ciptain Heron then himself retired to a dis-"], [26, "20 EDITH HEROS. \" Now, sir,\" sa'd the smith, as he lifted the foot of Wild's horse, \" we will mak* the parson's gal loway wait, as your worship is in a hurry.\" \" Bather I\" said Wild. * Be quick about it, for I want to be on the road again 1\" As he spoke, Jonathan Wild strolled up the old smithy, with that feeling of curiosity and prying whioh such a man wat sure to feel in a strange place. Quite casually, then, he tamed and looked to wards the forge fire. The aspect of things from his present point of view was completely changed. He taw Daisy quite plainly, and knew her at once. The ory that WUd raised was of the most ex traordinary character. The smith dropped the horse's foot on which he was at work. \" Go to the deuce !\" cried Wild. \" That will do.\" \"Beg pardon, sir,\" said the janissary, \" bnt we all thought we heard yoa cry out, and that some thine was amiss.\" \" Tell them no,\" whispered Heron. \" Go and hang yourself !\" said Wild. \" That will do.\" The farrier began to have a sort of glimmering of the truth of what was going on ; and as he pulled np tbe foot of Jonathan Wild's horse again he said, \" What, sir, are you the famous Mr. Wild, the officer, that people do talk about so much, and that everybody is so fond of ?\" Wild's men laughed at this. \" Answer them 1\" said Heron. Wild growled like a bear. \" Mind your business, and shut up yonr stupid owl't throat, you idiot I\" \" Thank you, sir ! Ah, I don't wonder at any body being quite taken by you. Daisy prioked up her ears. The party of Jonathan Wild in the road orowded round the entrance to the smithy. And then surely all would have been lost bnt for that rare presence of mind in moments of extreme peril which was so marked a charac teristic of Felix Heron. 11 'A can of ale, a can of ale, Is a good thing in cold weather : It warms a man, it helps a man, And puts him in good feather.' \" Heron whispered to Wild again. \" Send yonr men off I\" \u00ab I can't.\" WUd was about five long paces only in front of him. By a single bound Heron reached him, and caught him by the back of the neck. Wrenching, then, his head back with a violence and suddenness that nearly broke hit neck, Heron dashed the muzzle of one of his smaU pocket pistols right into his mouth, at he said, \"Choose, Jonathan Wild, between death or submission 1\" \" You must.\" \" You will mnrder me.\" \" Killing, in your case, would be no murder if I were ; but I will not\" \"Dare I trust you?\" \" As you like.\" \"And if I don't?\" \"Did yon speak, sir?\" asked one of WUd's men, from the road. \" Death !\" \" That will do. While there's Use there's hope Hoy ! Atkinson \u2014 and you, Devilskin !\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild.\" \" I have a fanoy to stay here.\" \" Very good, Mr. Wild.\" \" I find myself in such agreeable company, that I intend to wait here awhile. You can all ride ou to London, and wait at Little Newgate for m<\".\" \" Yes, sir. If we me\u00bbt Captain Heren, I sup pose we are to nab him ?\" \" Oh, dear, no !\" \" No, do you say, Mr. Wild ?\" \" Yes ; I say no. If you do meet him, give him my compliments, and say that I live ytt iu hopes of a clear stage aud no favour.\" \" Yes, sir.\" CHAPTER CLXXXtV. JONATHAN WILD HOLDS HIS LIFE AT THE MERCY OF FELIX BERON. \u2014 THE DAWN APPROACHES. The state cf affairs in that old smithy was curious enough. The smith could not imagine what had hap pened or what was abont to happen. He had heard tbe sudden shout from Jonathan Wild, but what was the immediate occasion of it he had no means of knowing. But he was doomed to be still further asto- nished. \" Be off with you all 1\" The troop clattered away. \" There 1\" said Wild : \" I suppose I shall have my brains blown out for being a fool.\" \" Not so,\" said Heron. \" When I make a pro mise, I keep it ; but you and I wUl now ride to town together.\" \" Indeed !\" Captain Heron whispered into Wild's right ear, with a hissing earnestness that admitted of no two opinions abont the sincerity of what he said. \"Jonathan Wild, for my own preservation, it is necessary tbat I should spare your life. If you are tired of that life, you can refuse to do at I bid you, in whioh case I shall give the alarm of some thing anres to your men, by the report of the pistol that will scatter yonr brains among all this rusty old iron!\" \" Don't I\" said Wild. \" Yes, and in truth. Firstly, however, you will give up your arms.\" \" There !\" Wild produced two pistolt from the deep pockett of his coat. He could only speak at the back of his throat, in an odd sort of way. \" I wUl, however,\" added Heron, \" make a bar gain with yon so far, that T can spare yon npon your obeying me.\" \" Agreed 1\" \"Did you tpeak, Mr. Wild ?\" asked the janis sary again from the road. \" 6ay no in your own amiable way,\" whispered Captain Heron. \" Is that all ?\" \" Yes, Captain Heron, that is all. I am not above knowing and owning that I am beaten \" \" Look yon here, Jonathan Wild : I warn you ! Anything in the shape of treachery, or an attempt to do me an injury, shall meet with, at my handi but one reception, and that ahall be death !\" \" I know it\" \" Be wary, then, as you wish to live.\""], [27, "EDITH HERON. 21 Heron then let Wild be perfectly free, and ad vanced towards the forge. Tbe smith had pat the shoe upon Wild's horse, and Heron said, quite calmly, \" Mr. Wild and I intend to ride to London together at soon at my mare is fit for the road.\" that any of the warm, beautiful tints are evoked from it. But that time was speedily approaching. . At about the distance of balf a mile from the village, the ground rote again to that Jonathan Wild and Captain Heron reached an eminence which commanded a fall view of many mUes of country. Tbe smith rapidly glanced from one to the otber of the men, but he made no remark. He set about patting on Daisy's shoe with skill and expedition ; and he sang as he worked \u2014 Heron drew rein. Wild did the same. He was afraid that something was abont to happen. Looking at him calmly in theeyei, Heron spoke to his evil-minded companion. \" Jonathan WUd, wherefore it it that the delight of your Use is to persecute me ?\" \" It is my duty.\" \" For which you gain nothing I\" \" My pleasure, tben \" \" Neither is it that, for you suffer far more pain than pleasure in the pursuit.\" \" My interest.\" \" Ay, so you fancy it ; but it it not so, for it will be your destruction as sure as you are now a living man, and might be a dead one at my feet this mo ment if I so willed it\" \" ' A man that's wise is not a fool, Which every person knowB ; His head is best upon his neck. Because it's there it growa' There, sir ! AU'i right now !\" \" And there is your guinea,\" said Heron. \"Thanks, sir!\" \" And there\u2014 ha, ha 1\" growled Wild,\u2014\" there is a eroat for my shoe !\" \" Oh, thank yon, sir I I shall want it to get a standing in a cart at Tyburn to see some one hanged tome fine morning.\" \" Hah !\" said Wild, as he sprung to his horse's back ; and then, turning to Heron, he said, \" You are a laggard, Captain. What, now, il I rode off?\" \"What do you want of me?\" growled Wild, with a downcast look. \" I should overtake you in half a mile,\" said Heron quietly as he mounted Daily. \"You would?\" \" Yoa are tuch a mass of wiokednest that the only thing any one with a grain of compassion in his heart could really want of you, would be that that you should repent\" \"Repent?\" \" Yea ; repent befere it is too late I\" \"Ha! hat\" \" Try it\" \" No \u2014 no ! What's the use \u2014 what's the use ? I wait for yon yon see !\" WUd and Captain Heron trotted out together upon the high road to London. A strange assorted pair. Never in all the ohanges possible to occur in his relations with Jonathan Wild, could Felix Heron have supposed it within tho reasonable bounds of probability that he could be in apparent peace with him on tbe highway. But tbe peace was only apparent Tbe thing of all others that staggered Wild, and kept him from some desperate attempt on the life of Captain Heron, was the cool confidence of the latter. The laugh wat a horrible one. \" You laugh at the word ?'' \" I do.\" \" And wherefore ?\" \" Because it is too iate, and has besn too late any time this Isst twenty years.\" \" I am afraid it is ; but if I thought you had suf ficient remains of humanity in yonr disposition to keep a promise, I would > xtoit one from you.\" \" What is it?\" \" It is that whatever may be your hostility for mo, aud whatever may be the attempt yon make against my life and liberty, you will never again contrive aoght against the Countess of Whitcombe and our child ?\" Jonathan thought it simply ont of the question that any one could be so calm and careless in bis company if they had not had some complete as surance of safety. The idea then took possession of Wild, that, al though he saw them not aud heard them not, some of Heron's frienda might be close at hand. In that case, he felt that his life might hang upon a word or look. Wild was silent. \"Do you hear me?\" \" I do. What wUl be the consequence il I won't promise ?\" \" Nothing.\" \"You don't threaten me with a ballet, then, if I won't ?\" Jonathan Wild did not want to die jast then, and theitfoie he was discreet accordingly. \" I do not I promised you your Use at the old smithy if you consented to what I then proposed\u2014 namely, to send your men off ou a wild-gooie chaEe\u2014 and I shall assuredly keep my word.\" \" Very well. Look you here, Captain Felix Heron, or Earl of Whitoombe, whichever yon like best to be called, I will promise ; and to help me Hem! No, it's no nee a man like me speak ing of he-iven \u2014 it's a place that is not likely tn belp me, or tbat I am in any way to be acquainted with.\" CHAPTER CLXXXV. CAPTAIN HERON AND EDITH COM MEKCE A NEW CAREER AFTER AN AWFUL DISCOVUKY AT WHITCOMBE HOUSE. The dawn of the new day was now quite evi dent Long streaks of sickly-looking light were in the eastern horizon. \" And yoa wiU keep faith ?\" \" I wiU.\" \" Hold up your hand to thit fair morning light and say ' I a wear it I' \" Jonathan Wild held up his hand, and Felix Heron thought he sa n it shake a little in the Ught air. It is a popular mistake to suppose that the first approach of daybreak is beautiful. On the con trary, it is raw, and dull, and chilly. It is not until the sun has made such progress that the disc of fire is close to the extreme edge of the horizon."], [28, "22 EoITII HERON. That Lady Trelawney would plsc* her in security he did not doubt, and if Wild kept his word, which by some freak he really, for once in bis lUe, might do, she might feel tolerably safe from any further persecutions. It was nearly five o'clock when Felix Heron galloped into London. Under an archway in the street that he had ap pointed them to wait for him, he found Ogle and Tom Ripon, and the rest of the little party. \"Thank the fates!\" cried Ogle, \"here is the Oaptain !\" \"Any news, Ogle?\" \" None ; only the watchmen have been a Uttle troublesome, so we have had to do the best we could with them. Oue of them is in that box.\" The bleared nud blood- shot eyes of tbe thief taker blinked and winked at tbe coming daylight like those of some wild predatory animal whoie habits were all nocturnal, and who could not bear the presence of the daylight \"I swear!\" he said- \" Then, Jonathan Wild, take back yonr pistols, aud you are free.\" \" What ?\" \" I say you are free.\" \"Bat\u2014 but \" \"But what?\" 11 My pistols ?\" \"Ob, yes! Take them!\" \" They are well loaded \" \" Doubtless ! I am not afraid !\" Wild turned of a deathly paleness as he took the pistols from the hand of Felix Heron, or, rather, a strange, cold, yellow tinge spread itself over his face. A watchbox was lying on its face on the pave ment Heron smUed. \" And another one,\" added Ogle, \" is down thij area, I think.\" \" Come, Ogle,\" said Heron, \" there is but one chance now of making our way into Whitcombe House unobserved, and that wiU be by the stable.\" Captain Heron led the way. The stable entrance to the old aristocratio man sion was in a neglected state, but the gate wat fast At Heron handed him the pistols their muzzles were towards his (Heron's) breast. A very slight effort on the part of Jonathan would have touched one of the triggers, and Felix Heron might have been a dead man. The temptation was great. Never in all his life, perhaps, had Felix Heron tried so hazardous an experiment as that with human nature. That was an obstacle that did rot long stand in the way of Ogle, who, standing for a moment on the back of his horse, was so enabled to easily clamber over. But he was determined to try it. Wild took the pistols, and, all of a tremble as he did so, he put them into the pocket of his coat that was next to Heron. Then he undid the smaU door in one of the Urge carrage entrance gates, and as Daisy stepped through very adroitly, the other horses followed the example as horses are apt to do. The wicket was closed and made fast again, so that the party felt themselves to bs in something like security. \" Yea,\" said the Reverend Mortification, \" but that my inward man calleth out in audible tone, the word breakfast, I should feel quite delighted.\" \"SUence!\" said Heron. \" Ogle, yon will see that the horses are well taken care of here, and we wUl consult afterwards about what bad best be done with them for safety's sake. Bestow them for the present in the stalls, and then all of yoa fol low me.\" \" No,\" he said, \" I \u2014 I am not quite to bad as all that ; and besides \" He glanced uneasily abont him. His firm impression was that the whole of this scene matt be takiBg place under the eyes of Heron's men \u2014 perhaps of Ogle and some others who were still trne to him. In that case, although be might kill Heron, it would only be a life for a. life. \" TeU me now, truly, my Lord Whitcombe,\" he said, \"are we not weU watched?\" \"Yes.\" \" By Jove, I thought so 1\" \"No.\" \" What do you mean ?\" \" I mean that we are watohed, but yon have mentioned the name of a heathen divinity instead of the Christian one.\" \" What do you mean ?\" \" I told you we were watched. It is not by Jove, but by the Creator of all. You may depend, Wild, that an eye is upon yon that never sleeps !\" As he spoke, Heron pointed upwards to where a soft and beantilul white cloud was floating in the air. This was soon accomplished by Ogle and Tom Ripon, and then Felix Heron led the way by the secret route from the stables to tbe house. Tom took care of the young girl, with whom he had ridden from Epping in such loving com panionship, and the Reverend Mortification, with his long body, looking over the head of Tom, brought up the rear of the party. That suite of chambers, which Edith used to call her own, and where those interviews with her brother, so full of evil to ber and to FeUx Heron, had taken place, was soon reached. Then Heron paused. \" Remain here, all of you,\" he said, \" and make yourselvet as much at home as yon can. This is my house, and I bid you welcome to it, with all my heart. I am on an expedition to explore the premises, and see that all is safe.\" \" Shall I not go with you Captain ?\" asked Ogle. \" No, Ogle, this suite of rooms is, I consider, the post of danger. Stay here, in case of any emer gency. Tom can come with me\" \" Yes, Captain,\" said Tom Ripon, \" I'm yonr man.\" Wild shaded his eyes with his huge, ooarse hand and looked np When he looked down again, Daisy and Captain Heion were far from him, and with that terrific swinging gallop that Daisy was such an adept in, she was going over the ground with the speed of an antelope. Captain Heron did not trouble to look back at Wild. On\u2014 on to London. That was his object, and he feared that he should reaoh there too late to make it safe to enter W hitcombe House as it had been his intention to do. Tbe great consolation of hit mind, however, was that Edith waa safe. Tom then whispered to the yonng girl. \"Keep np yonr spirits, my dear, till I come"], [29, "23 EDITH HERON. back. You see a fellow can't be in two places at once, and the Captain wants me to go and take care of him.\" Captain Heron and Tom Ripon reached that first and most costly and important floor of the houso where the drawing-rooms were situated. There they were, in all their magnificence. Faded, somewhat, by neglect, and assuming that strange appearance of dilapidation which houses so soon put on when deserted by human inhabit ants, bnt still costly and beantiful. Heron paused in that drawing-room with the green silken hangings, where he had last stood with the Earl of Bridgewater, previous t_i leaving the mansion, and looked around him with a sigh. \" Hem 1\" said Tom Ripon. Tom was anxions for Felix Heron to tay some thing. Bat the latter preserved a melancholy and ab stracted silence. The girl laughed. \" Come, Tom 1\" oried Heron. \" Follow me. Look well abont yon, Ogle, if you hear any strange noise. \"ThatwUlI, Captain!\" It was with rather a heavy heart that Felix Heron traversed the chambers of that mansion. He had as yet tasted bnt little of tbe supposed enjoyment of such a home ; and, in fact, aU hit recollections of it were tinged with some sorrow, or some great peril. And yet, under all the circumstances he thought it the safest retreat he could have. It wat perfectly true that he might have gone at on\u00abe to Lady Castleneau's house in Blcomsbury fields, but that wonld only in all probability have bought danger and trouble npon the old gentle woman. The next apartment was one, that if it did not transcend in actual magnificence that in which they were, certainly did so in size. The shutters of that room were now all closed. And beside, there it was as a res age at any time, if circumstances compelled him to leave Whitcombe Honte. Not the least wandering ray of light sonnd its way into it. Tom paused on the threshold. So did Heron. With these feelings, then, Captain Heron com menced his search through the mansion, with only Tom Ripon as a companion. And Tom was not a little proud of the implied confidence which Felix Heron had in him by selecting him on this dnty, although the real truth was that Heron did so in case he should have to send some message to Ogle. A feeling of he knew not what came over him, as he stood just one pace within that lordly apart ment. To the great reUef of Tom Ripon, then, Felix Heron spoke. \u00ab Tom !\" \" Yes, Captain.\" \" Did yon hear anything ?\" \" WeU, Captain, I thought I saw \u2014 that I heaid iomething !\" \"Phol pho!\" Tom whistled. \" Captain,\" said Tom , \" may I say a word ?\" \" What is it ?\" \" Don't you think we had better see to the prim ing of our pistols ?\" \" No.\" \" SUence !\" Tom was, to nse a common expression, rather taken aback by this brief reply. It was evident that the Captain was not talka tive jast then, and that the wisest thing Tom Ripon could do was to hold his tongue. And Tom was quite acute enough to see that. The trnth was that the further Felix Heron pene trated into that house, the more sad and power ful became his reflections and recollections. \" Yes, Captain.\" Heron made his way right aorosa the room to wards the windows, and took down the bar that fastened one set of shutters. He flung a leaf of the shntters open, which wa? not a reckless or dangerous thing to do in relation to the outer world, and any observation that might be made of the mansion from the street, for the blinds were closely drawn down, so that the movement of the shutter would not bs visible. It waa tbe house in which he had that memo rable and terrible interview with his father, the late Earl of Whitcombe, which had so strangely pre ceded the supposed death of that nobleman. It wat tbe bouse in which that father had been sonnd mnrdered by the brother of his own much loved Edith. A long ray of subdued light fell into the magni ficent apartment Then Tom Ripon nttered a cry. He ran towards the door as be did lo, for he had foUowed Captain Heron far into the rooms. Heron turned sharply from the window. \" What is the matter ? What is the tnattT ?\" It wat the honse, too, to which he had first brought Edith a9 to a home of her own, and to which he had welcomed her with the fond hope that it would be a happy one. Tom pointed to the table tbat stood in the cemre of the room. Alas ! how fallacious had been all those sum mer day dreams ! It needed, then, bnt one glance on the part of Heron to see the cause of Tom Ripon's a'aroi Seated at the table was a man, on rather a low chair, so that as he slept \u2014 for he seemed to sleep\u2014 his head retted conveniently on the edge of the table. How fleeting had been the dawn of the con tentment which he had vainly hoped to find within those walls! No wonder that Felix Heron found the atmo phere of that mansion pressing like a soUd weight npon his heart He began to fear that he should never be able even to make it the temporary refuge he had in tended. A cold, uncomfortable feeUng came across the heart of Heron. \" Speak I\" he oried : \" arouse yourself, be you whom yon may !\" All was still. The figure did not move hand or foot Tom Ripon got a pace or two nearer the door. \" Hilloa !\" shouted Heron again. \" Do you sleep so soundly that no sound can awaken } ou ?\" Tom shook his head. \" Captain,\" he Laid with a shudder, \" I rather think that's j oat it.\" If he conld not, and if Edith felt as he felt to wards Whitcombe House, there wonld be no re source bnt to trespass upon the hospitality of Lady Castleneau. Her mansion in Bloomsbury Fields would be always open to bim and to bis. The upper floor was left now behind them, and"], [30, "24 EDITH nERON. \"What is it?\" \" Why, whoover he ia, be sleep' so sound that nothing will ever wake him again.\" \"Ah!\" CHAPTER OLXXXVI. CAPTAIN HERON AND TOM FIND LORD WARRING- DALE IN A MOST DEPLORABLE CONDITION. \" That's it.\" \" Dead ?\" \" My idea, Captain, is jnit that. If that it not what may be called a corpus, why I am not tbe sort t f man I took myself to be.\" As Tom spoke, he drew himself up to all his height, with a triumphant expression, aa if he would have added that he rather thought he had settled the matter. The sound that had brought Felix Heron to a standstill on the grand staircase of Whitcombe Honse was an unmistakable groan from some one in the lower part of it Tom Ripon had not heard it, although in gene ral his senses were sharp enough ; but the fact was, he kept so continually looking over his shoul der for fear the dead Mr. Boom should be coming after him. that he attended to nothing else. Felix Heron stood listening. The groan came again. \" Now, Tom, did yon hear it ?\" \" Rather, Captain.\" Tom shuddered. \" Can it be so ?\" gaid Heron, as he now ap proached the table. Yes. There conld be no possible mistake aa to the character of the form that leant its head upon the table. No sound bnt that which shall awaken all humanity from the sleep of death could suffice to awaken the spirit that had lied from the cold, still form that there slept. The light of the young day without waa in creasing each moment, and there was quite sufficient for Felix Heron to see well the general aspect of the dead man. But ntthing but a sight of his face ounld afford any prospect of identifying him Heron took held of 'he back of his head. \" I cin't help thinking one thing, Captain.\" \" What is tbat ?\" \" Why, that the sooner we get ont of this house the better.\" \" I don't know that. Come on.\" \" But, Captain \" \"What now?\" \" It's full of dead people and ghosts. My idea it that the ghosts occupy all the lower part, and the dead folks are the lodgers up-stairs.\" \" Hush !\" \" Oh, don't ! don't I\" cried Tom. Heron lifted the head sufficiently to see the fsce. Tom was silent, but, unknown to Heron, he kept a fast hold of the skirt of Heron's coat. There was safety in the thought that he bad established such a connexion with so strong a party as Felix Heron. Yes ; he knew it Tbe face was that of Mr. Boom, the attorney, who had, with such singular audacity aud assur ance, striven to make himself aopear to be the heir to the earldom and estates of Wnitoombe. \u2022 With the utmost caution now, for Heron could not tell what form danger might take in tbat bouse, be slowly descended the remainder of the stairs. Tom gave him two or three pulls by the skirt of his coat as he went Tbat was the end of his career. He had died, then, in one of the lordly apart ments of the mansion of the family with whom he had no real connexion, but whose honours and properties he had made co infamous ar attempt to appropriate. \" What's that?\" asked Heron. \" What, Captain ?\" \" Something pulled my coat\" \" Ycu don't say eo, Captain. It's very odd that something has pulled mine, too.\" Tom thought tbat a capital excuse, and as Heron now knew perfeotly well what the pulling at his skirt meant, he said no more about it \" I know him!\" said Heron. \" Yes I\" said Tom. Tom Ripon was right out on the landing of the ktaircaie now. He had no sort of ambition to know the dead man. And so they reache 1 the ball. That superb hall, which was, with its statuary and its adornments, quite an apartment in which a feast might have been laid for a king. The groan came again. Heron felt convinced that it came from the im mediate direction of that room which had been, up to tbe day of his supposed death, in the occupation of his father, the late Earl. Was it possible that any oT (hose singular an . startling phenomena which both he and Edith had met with in connexion with that part of the man sion were about to renewed. All that awe and fright of the dead, and at the appearance of death, which is so common to the young, beset Tom Ripon, and nothing but the positive command of Captain Heron could have induced him to come back to that room. Heron did not, however, issue any suoh com mand. Quickly he stepped ont of the apartment, and cloted and locked the door. \" Be it so,\" he laid. \" Rest in peace ! I know not exactly how yon have come by your death, bat yoa shall, for the time being at least, have a costly sepulchre- Heron, then, with a slow and solemn step, went down the great staircase. Tom followed him so closely, too, that when abont two-thirds of the distance down Heron sad - denly paused, Tom waa nearly aa possible on his back. Ah, no! That was not possible. The late Earl slept tbe sleep of death, and was past all groaning. Captain Heron kept his hand npon one of his pistols, so that he might make use of it at a mo ment's notice, and went then directly towards the private study of his father. The door was fast \"Hush!\" said Heron. \" Yes, Captain. Oh, dear I is there any more dead no's, or is he coming after as.\" \" Hush, I say I Listen !\" That is to say, the door of the outer room, which served as a kind of vestibule to the apartmeut with all tbe mysterious doora and oupboards where the late Earl used to sit ao much alone."], [31, "25 EDITH HERON. Heron tried to find out in what manner the door was fastened, and he felt convinced it waa locked on the inside. No one appeared. The groans that had, in his estimation, so evidently come from that direction, had oeased. The room was but dimly lighted, for all the dayh'ght that could make its entry into it had to come through a window of stained glass, that natnraUy hindered its progress and its brightness. Heron, then, closely foUowed by Tom, advanced towards the study cf the late Earl. TheD, when close to the threshold of it, the groan came again ; and by being much more dis tinot it came in a muoh more dismal fsshion to their ears. The key, too, was in the lock. If he wonld make hia way in that direction the ock must be forced. The small aide windowa of the door of the house had shutters, to eaoh of which waa a pro tecting iron bar lying slantwise aorosa them, and abont three feet in length. More admirable substitutes for crow-bars could not have been sonnd. With one of them Felix Heron soon forced the look, that resisted fair means to move it The door opened with a crash. It was just possible that such an act as this might bring him face to face with some foe. With this idea Heron stepped aside, and held hit pistol in hit hand ready for action. No I \"Oh, gracious 1\" exclaimed Tom. \" Husb, Tom !

' he said ; . and say who you are that, in sickness and distress, have made a home and a refuge of this house ?\" There was no reply. \"Another dead 'un!\" said Tom. \" Upon my word, Captain, this is like to be a lively sort of place; one won't know what room to go into without finding it occupied by somebody or an other who has popped off to be a ghost I\" Heron let Tom go on speaking without stopping him ; for he was really too much interested by the object on the couch in the corner of that room to heed what he said. \" Wretch, yourself ! You aee, yon have come to a bad end, and worse is to come after. I only wish old Daddy Mortification was here this mo ment ; he would bring you what he calls spiritual consolation, and let yon into all abont them lakes of burning brimstone and melted lead, and such like little matters thai yon will toon know all about Suppose I try to teU you?\" \" No, no !\" \" Oh, it's all for yonr good !\" \" Mercy !\" \" Well, it ain't pleasant, but I can't help it First of all, yon are picked np with a red-hot pitchfork in the small of your back.\" \" Fiend !\" A glance at the wan and wasted face of that object waa enough for recognition. It was his half-brother, Lord Warringdale, who lay there, apparently with bnt the thinnest pos sible shadow; partition between him and death. Heron looked at him with a feeling that was compounded of loathing and compassion. There, at length, lay the man who had been the cause of such a world of danger and suffering to him and to Edith- \" Yes, that's the gent as will do it I Then you go on to the gridiron, when the first grUling goes on, and then \" \" What is all this ?\" asked Heron, \" 0 h, X was only telling him what he waa agoing to,\" said Tom. \" I've heard old Mortification say so much about it that I am quite a reverend article myself, I am ! It's what he calls consola tion to dinners in their latter ends, you see!\" \" Peace, Tom, peace 1\" Captain Heron raised the fainting form ef Lord Warringdale with his left arm, and held some water to his lips. The fevered man drank long and eagerly of the cool draught \" Life ! \u2014 Use !\" he gasped. \" That is new life I Oh, what I have suffered transcends the tongue of man to tell !\" \" Did yon, in the midst of all that suffering,\" asked Her n, \" ever reflect on what you had made others suffer ?\" Lord Warringdale looked in Heron's face with a glance of terror. Perhaps np to that moment he had not had a fall and perfect apprehension of who it was that had brought him that draught oi water. If, however, such had been the case it waa so no longer. He knew Heron well I There he lay, still breathing, and completely at his mercy. With a pressure of hia hand. With a stamp of his foot By the use of any weapon that came most ready to hand, he might have killed him, crushing the life out of him as easily as one might tread npon a enail in a garden path. But Heron was not the man to do that Lord Warringdale, in that extremity of his for tunes, was probably more safe in the bands of the man he had most injured of all the world, than as if he had been found by any one else who could have rescued him. s \" Tom 1\" said Heron. \" Yes, Captain !\" \" Run down to the kitchen of the house, and find some water.\" \"Y-e-s.\" \" Run !\" \" Oh, dear I\" \" What do yon mean ? Do yon not hear me ?\" \" Yes\u2014 oh, yes, Captain ! Did yon say the\u2014 a the kitch\u2014 kitch \u2014 en ?\" The last lingering of shame in the sinner's breast were summoned forth then ; and Warring dale oonld not look above one moment into the eyes of that brother to whom he had been so bitter and uncomprising a foe. He looked askance, and groaned. The stain of blood was npon his pillow, and his condition wat altogether one that, to those who did net know him, wonld have provoked compaa aion. \"I did.\" \" Oaptain, I'm a highwayman.\" \" Be off.\" \" A high \u2014 way \u2014 man ! I don't like ghosts and people of that sort ; and if the old dark kitchens of this home are not just about as crammed full of that sort of company as any place can be, I'm a Frenchman !\" Thentmoit that any one who did know could feel for him might be comprehended nnder the head of forbearance. \" Very weU. If yon are afraid, I wiU go my self.\" \" Stop, stop ! I am not exactly afraid, only I \u2014 I\u2014 Oh, he's off! I wonder, now, who this dead 'un is. Hilloa 1\" It wat Felix Heron who spoke first ; and his deep-toned voice broke the awful stillness of the room, and made Lord Warringdale shudder as he heard it. Lord Warringdale at thia moment opened hia eyes, aud Tom Ripon knew him. \"What, is it you?\" \"Help \u2014 oh, help! I am dying!\" \" And a capital job, too,\" said Tom. \" If yon had thought of that little way of being of no far ther trouble ever so long ago, it wonld have been a good job.\" \" _nd ia it thus,\" he said, \" that we meet again, brother ?\" Lord Warringdale only shuddered again. \" Why, oh, why has it been that, inakiug your self my foe to the txtent you have, you likewise have been buch a foe to yourself ?\" \"Yes, that is it I\" groaned Warringdale."], [33, "27 EDITH HERON. \" Yon see that now ?\" \" No doubt of that, Captain. Better to have few hands than bad ones, any day in tbe week.\" At this moment both Ogle and Captain Heron were startled by the sudden appearance of Tom Ripon, who called out, \" Captain, he's a cutting away aa fast aa he oan, and wants some spirituous consolation !\" \"Yes, I do!\" \" And yet I doubt not but that if all had to be repeated it wonld be again ever aa it has been, would it not ?\" \"No I ob.no!\" \" Tell me \u2014 how came yon here ?\" \" I have met with a wound, and I crawled here, I suppose, to die !\" \" Do you repent ?\" \"With all my heart 1\" \" Of the wouad,\" said Tom Ripon, \" which you say, Captain, lays him np so that he ia forced to keep in his claws a bit ?\" \" Peace, Tom \u2014 peace !\" \" I only spoke the truth, Captain.\" Lord Warringdale bent a malignant glance at Tom, and then, in a whining, supplicating tone, he said, \" That is the way \u2014 that is the way ! There have always been people, brother, to fan the flame of discord between ua, and make us feel hatred.\" \"Yea, that will I give him !\" cried Mortifica tion. \" Spiritual, I suppose yon mean ?\" said Heron. \" Yea, it ia all the same ; for, as the Psalmist judiciously remarks, by taking spirits down, yon keep the spirits up ; and that reminds me, Thomas, that, yea, I gave you a bottle to take care of.\" \" Yea, you did \" said Tom. \" Where it it ?\" \" Here, daddy.\" \" Ob, excellent Thomaa, yon are a good youth !

There have been no such people. Yonr own acts have been tbe cause of all.\" \"Nay, I \" \" Traitor,\" said Heron, sternly, \" do not attempt to excuse yourself, or to fritter away your wicked ness, or you will make me look back to too many proofs of it which it would be well for yon if I could forget.\" Warringdale was silent. \" Tom,\" aaid Heron, \" wUl you stay by this man awhile ?\" \" Cease thia contention,\" aaid Heron, \" and follow me, both of you. I may need you.\" \" Yet, Oaptain.\" \" No, no 1\" said Lord Warringdale ; \" he wUl kill me !\" CHAPTER CLXXXVII. \" Oh, don't be frightened,\" said Tom ; \" I shan't interfere with you. I can see you are going, and it wouldn't be any good for a man like me to help you on, even with a kick \" \"I shall soon be back, Tom,\" added Heron. At he spoke, he left the room, without paying any further attention to the remonstrances of Warringdale. Rapidly Captain Heron made his way to where he bad left Ogle, and, touching him on the arm, he led him aside. LORD WARRINGDALE MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARS, AND HAS AN UNHAPPY MEETING WITH JONATHAN WILD. The course which Felix Heron had made np his mind to carry out in regard to Lord Warringdale, was Ihe only one that presented itself to him which wonld carry the two conditions he required. To get rid of him from Whitcombe. To do nothing in to getting rid of him that would be detrimental to hit life. \" Ogle,\" he aaid, \" two of onr old foes are in the house 1\" Ogle wat desirous of just placing Warringdale in the street, but Captain Heron overruled him, and wonld not have it so. \" Two, Captain ?\" Ogle placed his hands npon his pistols. Heron shook his head. \" He is hurt,\" he said, \" and should be taken somewhere that he can at once have assistance. Come, Ogle, and yon, too, Mortification, we will all go together abont this business.\" The room in which Lord Warringdale had been lying was soon reached. What was the surprise of Felix Heron to find it vacant. \" There is no occasion, Ogle, for that. One is dead, and the other, I think, is dying.\" \"Who, in the name of goodness, or badness, Captain, are they ?\" \" Boom, the lawyer, and Lord Warringdale.\" \" You don't say that, Captain ?\" \" I do, Ogle. They must both be removed from Whitcombe House.\" During the short time that it had taken Tom Ripon to seek Captain Heron, Lord Warringdala had in some way most mysteriously disappeared. \" Yon see, Tom,\" said Ogle, \" that when yon are left in charge of a prisoner, nothing that that prisoner can say or do should be sufficient to in duce you to leave him.\" \" But,\" said Tom Ripon, \" I thought he was at his last gasp, and that perhaps the Captain would Uke to see him start ?\" \" To be sure, Captain !\" \" I wonld recommend that the dead body of Boom be merely taken somewhere and pnt down, so that the police may find him, and make the most of it.\" \"All right. Captain!\" \" As regards Lord Warringdale, I propose that he be removed at night to one of the London hos pitals, and there left \" \" Too good for him.\" \" No, Ogle ; let it be done. Mortification Ripon wiU help you, and so will Tom. We are rather short-handed now, Ogle, but I daresay wa shall snansge.\" Heron shook his head. \" I fear, Ogle,\" he laid, \" that my Lord War ringdale was not quite so bad as he made ont?\" \" Or,\" replied Ogle, \" either shams of fear hav$ given him strength to get sway in preference to aeeing you again,\""], [34, "28 EDITH HERON. \" Be it so. He has only saved ns tbe trouble of removing him. Ogle, you will see to the oth6r affair I\" That person stopped. Stopped exactly at the mouth of the court \"Hilloa, there I\" Lord Warringdale uttered a cry of fright. He knew the voice. \" The dead lawyer ?\" \" Yes, he ia above \u2014 Tom will ahow you.\" \" Oh, dear me, no I\" said Tom. \" You can't miss him, Ogle, if yon go into obo of the big rooms up-stairs. I think, Captain, I ought to, you know, look after the ladies.\" Captain Heron was not disposed to submit Tom to the terror of any further personal commuoica lion with what he (Tom) called the \" dead 'un,\" so he spoke to Ogle in a low voice. \" You and Mortifioation manage it between yon. Tbe boy is terrified at death.\" Ogle nodded. But while all this was going on in Whitcombe House, Lord Warringdale, who had fled from it, had not exactly exchanged what he thought a bad situation for oue much better. \"Hilloa, there!\" The man was Jonathan Wild. In his present debUitated state, Warringdale had no reason to wish to meet Wild. He always had a dread of him when he was well and able to take care of himself ; bnt now that he was at the meroy of any one, he dreaded to saU into the hands of tho man who knew no mercy. But, at we have said, it was too late. Wild had s*en him. True, he had not recognised him; bnt the manner in which Warringdale had turned into the court had excited Wild's curiosity, and he was rc- Salved to know who it was. \" Hilloa !\u2014 hilloa, there !\" Warringdale made no reply. Beyond that first cry of alarm he uttered no He certainly had had a dread of meeting again with Heron, and when alone with Tom he had simulated that death-like swoon which had alarmed Tom, and induced him to seek Heron. But the moment Tom turned his back, Lord Warringdale made a desperate effort, and rose from the coucb. He struggled into some of his clothes, and wrapping round him a roquelaire cloak, and fixing his hat firmly on his head, he staggered out of the room into tbe hall, and opening the outer door, left the mansion. Lord Warringdale felt like an owl, who, by some accident, is forced to face the daylight. He winked and blinked at the early morning enn, and staggered along St James's Street like a drunken man. \u25a0ound. How faint was the hope that Jonathan Wild would past on. \" Oome out 1\" Lord Warringdale shrunk down into tho shadow of a door-way. \" Come out, I say 1\" No answer I \" Very well, then, I mast make yon, and I am apt to do that in not the gentlest manner in the world. Stay ; perhaps if yon know who I aro, yoa wiU come oat I am Jonathan Wild. Ha ' hal\" Wild always pronounced his own name in tbn harshest and most hideous way he possibly could, and generally added to it a fiendish laugh, snch s. may be heard npon the stage at times. No; that did not succeed. The skulking figure in the court came not out The hour was yet sufliciently early to make the streets bare of people; and, in fact, the only person who saw and stopped to look at Lord Warringdale, as he made his way in devious fashion down the street, waa a very small tweep, who was np early in tbe practice of his vocation. And so Warringdale reached Pall Mall, without having any fixed idea of what to do or where to B0- ~ , , A. ,._\u2022__ AA. i Wild drew hia henger, and walked np the oourt. He seized Lord Warringdale by the collar of the roquelaire cloak, and dragged him ont into the daylight. One look at the pale, cadaverous face was enough. If Ciplain Heron had choten to institute the least pursuit of him, he would have come up with him easily. It was not with any fixed object as regarded any particular direction that Warringdale turnod to the left, in the route towards Charing Cross. He began to feel weaker eaoh moment ; for the temporary exoitement which had enabled him to leave Whitcombe House was passing away. He had to stop to support himself by a street post. Wild started with surprise. \" My Lord Warringdale ?\" \" Yes \u2014 yes \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 yes !\" \" Why did yon avoid me, and how is it that I see you in this plight ?\" \" I think, Jonathan Wild, yon might, by think ing back a little, guess what has put me into such a condition.\" Some one approached. Was it a friend or a foe ? Lord Warringdale was in that frame of mind when a man is apt to think every one who ap proaches him must bear one or the other of those characters. He could not imagine tbat be might meet people who would be perteotly indifferent to him, and only look upon him as some intoxicated man re turning from a late revel. The footsteps came nearer and nearer, and Lord Warringdale waa so impressed with the idea that they boded danger to him, that he made an effort to glide into the obscurity of a court that wasolose at hand. \" Dear me, no I\" \" Yes, ves I Yon \u2014 you \" \"Well?\" \" I say no more but to express a desire that yon will leave me.\" \" Leave yon ?\" 6aid WUd, with a aardonio grin. \" Leave a friend and a nobleman like yon in inch a state of distress ? Never I\" \"I beseech you?\" \" Never ! never 1\" Wild turned round twice as he spoke, and looked np and down Pall Mall. There was a glare abont his eyes that was awful to see. But he was too late. Not exactly too late to make hia way into the court; but too late to avoid the obaervation of the person who was approaching. Did he contemplate at that moment the murder of Lord Warringdale? It would almost seem like it No one waa visible."], [35, "EDITH HERON. 29 \" My lord 1\" \"What? What would j<n say?\" \" I think yon will never buoceed.\" \" Succeed in what?\" \" Not where, my lord ?\" \" To your house.\" \" Oh, I did not think of it. Ha ! ha ! So yon don't like Little Newgate ? Well, well, I admit that people may be prejudiced against it ! \" \" Not there, I say \u2014 not there.\" Wild was thinking where he could belt beatow Lord Warringdale, and it occurred to him that the chamber! lately in the occupation of Mr. Boom might suit. Since the death of Boom, Jonathan had taken possession of the suite of chambers, and had suc ceeded in stifling inquiry abont their former tenant by sticking on the outer doors various announcement* and little slips of paper according to the custom in the chambers of the Inns of Court. \" In getting the earldom of Whitcombe from Felix Heron.\" \" Yes \u2014 oh, yes, I have good hope, and ften \" \"Then, what?\" \"I will pay you.\" \" Indeed !\" \" I wUl, in truth.\" \"Look yon here, my Lord Warringdale. I hold yonr bonds for a large sum \u2014 as large a sum as one hundred thonsand pounds ; and the only portion of it that is at all secured, consists of a small estate at Hampton Wick, which you have for yonr lifetime been deprived of, bnt which, if yon were dead, I could take possession of.\" \"Dead? dead?\" \"Out of town! Return next week! On profes sional business in the north !\" Such-like were the little placards which Wild changed from time to time, so that he stilled inquiry, and kept possession of the suite of gloomy rooma. To a man like Jonathan Wild, such a suite of chambers might at any moment be of tho most in calculable use. \" Yet, dead !\" The hateful look came again to the eyes of Jonathan Wild. Again he looked up and down Pali Mall. No one wat visible. He looked np at the windows of the opposite houses. It was to them, then, that as ter a little considera tion he resolved to take Lord Warringdale. \" Hark yon my lord,\" he aaid; \" I have a friend in the Temple.\" \"The Temple?\" \" Yes ; you know it weU, no doubt. I have a friend there who will gladly receive yon into his chambers for a time until you get quite weU.\" This was a proposition that at all events waa more agreeable to Warringdale than one that in volved a visit to Wild's house. Not one was open, nor was a blind removed at that early hour. Wild tightened his hold of the hilt of his hanger. One blow with it at the back of the neck wonld produce in stant death. \"8 weep I sweep I\" WUd started. The little sweep who had looked at Lord Warringdale in St. James's-street, turned suddenly the corner into Pall Mall. \" Very well,\" he laid ; \" I consent to that.\" He felt quite certain that, say what he would, fae shonld not succeed in shaking Wild off. \" Come on, then- We can find a hackney coach at the corner of the Haymarket, no donbt.\" Lord Warringdale was compeUed to lean on the arm of WUd. Wild wat foiled. There was a witness to the deed he meditated, in whose presence he felt that he dared not aot. That little sooty nrchin, not above ten years old, was, at that moment, more than a match for the great Jonathan WUd. He prevented him, by his mere presence, from -ommitting murder. \"Sweep I aweep!\" \" Go to the dence !\" said Wild. The coach at the corner of the Haymarket was easUy enough found, and in half an hour from the v.me when WUd had dragged Lord Warringdale ont of the court in Pall Mall, they were both at the entrance to the Temp'e. Wild tapped at the wicket The porter opened it suddenly, for it was before the regular hour. \" What now ?\" \" Do yer want ere a ohimley sweep, governor?\" asked the little sweep. \" No, and be hanged to yon !\" \" Thank yer, governor. Do yer want a sweep anywheres?\" Thia last inquiry was addressed to Lord Wa- ringdale, who shook his head in reply to it. The boy passed on. Jonathan Wild sheathed his hanger. He gave np the idea of moidering Lord Warringdale in the open street, from the moment that some human eyes, although they were only those of a poor little sweep, had seen him in company with the pro posed victim. Warringdale had not been fully aware of his real danger. If he had been, he wonld surely have raised the street with his cries. \" To Mr. Boom's chambers.\" \" Then, yon can't come in.\" Wild lifted his hat about a couple of inches above his head, and the porter then knew him at once. A look of terror came over him, and he flung open tbe wicket. Wild, with a nod, entered the Temple with Lord Warringdale. Such, at that period, was the reputation of the great thief-taker, and suoh the terror he inspired, that there was not an official of any description in London, whose \" Conscience with injustice was corrupted,\" \" My lord,\" said Wild, \" I can see that you are ill\" who did not feel the possibility of falling into h's clutches some day. It is possible tbat tbe man at the wicket-gate of the Temple might have his own reasons for being civil to such a personage as Jonathan Wild. \" Now, my lord,\" said Wild to Lord Warring dale, as he reached the chambers of the late Mr. Boom, \" ycu will be safe and comfortable here.\" \" Wounded !\" \"Ah, I suppose en. It is both a duty and a pleasure to me to look alter you- Take my arm. I will lead you to some p!ace of safety.\" \" No, no !\" \"No?\" \"Not there!\" \"I hope so.\""], [36, "30 EDITH HERON. \"Be assured you will. You much mistake me If you suppose for a moment that I am your foe : im the contrary, I still entertain the hope of one day seeing you with the earldom of Whitcombe on yonr brow.\" \" Alas, I doubt it !\" \" Never give np a game, my lord, while there is a remote chance even of wining it.\" Wild produced the key of the chambers, and opened the door. \" By the by, my lord,\" he added, aa they croased the threshold of the gloomy rooma, and WUd closaed the outer door with a bang, \" where did you come from when I ao opportunely saw yoa in Pall Mall?\" \" From Whitoombe House.\" \" Whitcombe House ! Why \u2014 why, then \" \" Then, what ?\" \"Hem! I don't know; bnt may I aak \u2014 did cariosity prompt you to go over it?\" \" No. I was too unwell.\" \" I perhaps could, if it were something simple and fit for a man out, of health. I feel weak, and very likely some of it is for want of food.\" \" No doubt, no doubt! I can give yon some thing which will aet yon to rights, and you will feel no such want.\" Wild got np and went to the cupboard again. Now, it happened that Mr. Boom had been ac customed in tbat room to settle hia cravat, and otherwise pnt himself in out-of-doors order, so that he had a small looking-glass hung on the wall. Lord Warringdale was opposite to the glass, and he saw in it what Wild was abont He sat fasoinated I CHAPTER CLXXXVIU. JONATHAN WILD CONSIDERS THAT HE HAS \" Then yon did not see in the first-floor, in one of the drawing-rooms \" \" What ? Why do you pause ? What did yon expeot me to see ?\" \"Nothing, bnt in what acapital state of preser vation the furniture waa in.\" Wild was quite satisfied in hii own mind that Lord Warringdale could not have seen the dead body of Boom in Whitcombe House, and so ad mirably kept his countenance while questioned. \" Come,\" he said, \" is not this snng ? I think yon knew Boom.\" \" Yon know well I did I\" \"Oh, ah! Of course!\" * Where ia he ?\" GOT RID OF ANOTHER TROUBLESOME ENCUM- RANCE. Yes ! Lord Warringdale waa fascinated ! With a kind of horror that took away his breath, and that sat like tons of lead upon all hia limbs, depriving him of the power of action, he looked upon the proceedings of Jonathan WUd in the little dressing-glass of Mr Boom. Like tome bird fascinated by the eyes of a snake, Lord Warringdale could only look on in speech less horror. Wild did go to the cupboard. Bat it was not to get something for Lord War ringdale to eat. On the contrary, be took from it an object that wonld have been rather hard of digestion. It was one of those short, heavUy-weighted, hideous bludgeons which Wild might have been said to have invented. \" Impossible to say with any certainty ; opinions differ so much on that subject \" \"What subject?\" \" Why, as regard to what is likely to be known of such a man; although, being a lawyer, the general impression will, of coarse, be that he has gone \" Wild pointed downwards. \"What on earth do you mean, Wild?\" asked Lord Warringdale, almost angrily. \"Why? don't you Snow that Boom is dead?\" \"Dead? No!\" \" Oh, I thought you did, and that yon referred to his ultimate destination. But it don't matter. What may be the value, now, of that little property at Hampton Wick ?\" The hateful expression of Wild's eyes decidedly deepened. \" About eight thousand pounds. It brings me in three hundred a-year, which, in truth, is all I have to live on.\" Not above three feet in length, and at one end a knob of lead of a good two pounds in weight, the blndgeon was calculated to be a most mur derous weapon. It generaUy was so in the hands of Jonathan Wild. That it was to be the instrument of his death L\"rd Warringdale did not doubt for a moment One good downright blow of it would fraoture his skull were it as hard as iron. Wild, with the terrible weapon in his hands, stoed behind the chair on which Warringdale sat. He certainly had not the least idea that his viciim saw him in the glass. The position of that Uttle mirror had escaped the observation of Jonathan, and he attributed tbe quiescence of Warringdale to exhaustion and a want of suspicion of his terribl\" peril. But it to happened that as Wild raised himself on his toes to give the blow of the bludgeon greater force upon the defenceless head of Lord Warringdale, he happened to cast his eyes right on to the little glass. There he taw his own face. \" Ah I\" \"Yes-all!\" \" Oh ! Three hundred a-year, and abont eight thousand its saleable value. Let's be jolly !\" \"What?\" \" Jolly, I said !\" Wild went to a cupboard and took from it a square, Dutch-looking bottle and a couple of glasses, and placed them on the table. \"Let's be jolly 1\" he said again. \"No!\" replied Warringdale. \"In my state of health I dare not drink.\" \" You had better.\" And there he oaw Lord Warringdale's- A glance was quite sufficient to let him see the terrible expression of concentrated agony tbat was on tbe features of Warringdale. The look! \"No, no!\" \" You must,\" \" I cannot\" The stare ! The parted lips! The protruding eyes ! Tbe bristling hair! \"Well, 'a willful man moot havo his way,' as the old saying has it Will yon ent anytbipg ?\""], [37, "31 EDIFH HERON. All the tokens and expressions of a man struck dumb, and unnerved by some awful shock which has come over him like the shadow of death. \" Ah !\" cried Wild. With his bands, then, in his pockets, Wild left the Temple, after sticking a fresh notice on Mr- Boom's door\u2014\" Return next week !\" Wild whistled a tune as he passed out of the Temple into Eisex Street, Strand. \" I rather think,\" he said, \" that matter is abont as well over in the way it is as in any other. If I had knocked him on the head in the chambers, I should have had the usual bother about the disposal of the body, and now he has kindly dis posed of that himself.\" While all this was going on at the chambers of Mr. Boom in the Temple, Captain Heron had left Ogle in oharge of the house in St James's Street, and on foot he gently took his way to Castleneau Houae, where he fully expected to lee Edith. It wanted only that. Some sound, no matter what. The speU was broken. Lord Warringdale waa able to move. With a yell that sounded far and near in the Temple, be sprang to hia feet. At the same moment down came the bludgeon. Bnt it missed its victim. It only struck the back of the massive old chair on which Warringdale had been seated, and at once smashed it into epUnteiE. \" Help ! help !\" \" Cursea 1\" \" Help ! Murder 1\" \"Consume yon !\" Warringdale fled round the ro3m. Jonathan Wild pursued him. \" Murder 1 murder I\" Nor was he disappointed. Lady Trelawney, at the request of Edith, had driven, with her and the ohild, direct to her aunt's house. Oh, with what joy it was that once again, after all the dangers of the night, Edith rested on the heart of her Felix. \"Perdition! Fury!\" \" Help ! Oh, mercy I\" Lord Warringdale, in his flight, flung down a chair. From the shadow of one of the dtep window recessess now, 'there stepped forth a gentleman. It was Colonel Trelawney. He took Heron by the hand, aa he said, \" My sister sent for me to see you here, and I have had a long talk with Lady Castleneau about you. Can anything be done to put an end to all the perils that beaet you?\" \" I fear not,\" said Heron. \" But I am lighter at heart than I was.\" Jonathan Wild could not stop himeelf in time to avoid it, and be fell sprawling over it. That waa a mercy. Warringdale reachea the door of the chamber. For a moment the lock baffles him. He cinnot open it. He is lost ! No I It yields I He rushes out to the old staircase ! \"Help, help! Murder!\" Wild has got to his feet again. He pursues his victim. He seea him half-way down the stairs. A door opens on the landing below, and a man looks ont. \" Indeed !\" \" Yes.

Edith, I think, for the fntore, will be safe. \"Safe, Felix,\" cried Edith. \"You speak in riddles. What can you \u2014 what do you mean ?\" \"Simply this, dear Edith: that whatever may be my dangers or persecutions, I do not think that my breast will again be attempted to be reached through yoa.\" \" How is that, Felix ?\" asked Lady Castleneau. Heron smiled. \" Bless ns all, what is the matter ?\" Wild slings his bludgeon after Lord Warring dale, but this man had just put his head ont at bis chamber door to intercept it. Crack I The rap on the side of the man's head was severe, and he staggered back into bis own room again. WUd almost flings himself down the atairs after Lord Warringdale. Bnt the latter has the start of him. \"I have made an arrangement with Jonathan WUd.\" \" With Jonathan WUd?\" Revenge and murder may have fleet feet, bnt fear has wings as well. Jonathan has no chance of overtaking the mad dened fugitive, and yet he keeps np the chase. Across the large garden of the Temple towards tbe terrace Lord Warringdale takes his way. The river is before him. \" Even so.\" Well might snch an announcement from the lips of Felix Heron excite tbe most unqualified surprise at Castleneau House. But Edith saw that there was a something more in the affair than Heron bad yet explained. \"Tell na all, Felix, and let us share with you in the lightness of heart you speak of if we can \" \" The explanation, dear Editb, it short and simple. Circumstance! placed the Use of WUd completely in my power, and he knew it\" \"You spared the vUlain?\" said Colonel Tre lawney. \" I did!\" Jonathan Wild, intent on murder, behind him. With one desperate leap Warringdale is in the \u25a0bream. WUd saw him tossed abont in the heaving tide, and then disappear, as he was carried away rapidly down the stream. \" That will do I\" said Jonathan- ** Good morn ing to my Lord Warringdale ! Ha, ha I\" The alarm in the Temple was great, but WUd took bo notice of it. He managed to mingle with a throng of people, who in vain asked eaoh other what it was all about, and then made his way back to Boom's eh ambers. \" Then more the pity.\" \" Perhaps so ; and yet I never, for the life of me, could take snch vengeance upon a foe who ao entirely stood at my mercy.\" Lady Castleneau nodded ber approval. \"I made np my mind,\" added Heron, \"to try if it were possible that even in so degraded and depraved a nature as Jonathan Wild's, every spark of better feeling was extinct ; so I gave birn his life on condition that whatever might be bfc hostility to me, and however be might seek to He picked up bis blndgeon at he went, and carefully put it into the cupboard again.

A more welcome visitor to Castleneau House could not possibly have been found than the Earl of Bridgewater; and Felix Heron welcomed him with that silent pressure of the hand which is far more eloquent than words. The young Earl looked about him inquiringly aa he said, in a tone of only half- seriousness, \" I oan well perceive that some important affair is in progress, and perhaps I onght to retire.\" \"Not so, my dear friend,\" said Lady Castle neau. \"On the contrary, your presence is most opportune.\" \" Yes,\" added Edith ; \" you will be able to take a calmer and cooler view of affairs than perhaps any of na can.\" The impetuous young Earl shook his head. \" Lady Whitcombe,\" he said, \" I am very much afraid you give me credit for qualities I do not possess. Where my feelings are much interested, I am not very cool or calm.\" \" But your judgment is good. Felix, teU our dear friend, the Earl, what your plan is.\" Upon this, Felix Heron related all to the Earl of Bridgewater that is already known to the reader. \" I hope I em one of them ?\" \" Yon are, Colonel.\" \" Then I can guess the other.\" \" Doubtless yon can.\" \" It is our good friend Bridgewater.\" \" Even so. And now I wiU farther explain what I think of doing.\" The ntmost attention was given to Captain Heron, while he tpoke in rather a low voice, aa though he feared the very walla might carry to some hostile eara the secret of his plans. \" I am quite certain that Whitcombe House will be deserted, because it is well known that either I or my half-brother, Lord Warringdale, must be the owner of it, and no one will interfere between ns.

Do you consent Heron ?\" Edith crept closer to Heron, aa if the mere pro nunciation of the word \" dead,\" even in so remote a connexion with him, was one step towards snch a calamity. \"Fear nothing, Edith,\" added the Earl of Bridgewater. \" I only wish him to seem to die, in order tnat he may really live.\" \" Go on !\" cried Lady Castleneau. \" Let us hear all !\" \"I do.\" \" And you, Edith ?\" \"Yes\" \"And you, Lady Castlenean?' \" I consent\" \" And yon, Lady Trelawney ?

Heron, when he came down stairs to the break fast-room of Lady Castleneau in this disguise, looked so perfectly the soldier, that no one doubted for a moment the efficacy of the dress to shield him from all eyea. They were all silent. \" I am quite convinced that if it was supposed Felix Heron wjs no more, no molestation wonld be offered to Edith taking possession of Whit combe House, and possibly of some, if not, by degrees, all, of the estates of Whitcombe.\" \"Dear Edith, what say you to this aobeme?\" asked Heron. \" You would stiU be with me ?\" \u25a0 \" As ever.\" \" You would only have, as in a play, \" aaid tbe Earl of Bridgewater, \" to aeem a widow.\""], [41, "35 EDITH HERON.

The plan, in its details, wat that Edith, so soon as the report of the death of Heron was well abont, was to take possession of Whitcombe House. \" But to tell you, and show you, bow you may by a signal service, set aU these very suspicions at rest, and raise yourseU to good favour with an ex alted personage.\" \"The King?\" \" I said an exalted personage.\" \" The hangman ?\" \" Mr, Wild !\" Ogle, Mortification, and Tom Ripon were to be domestics, or play the part of them ; aud Mrs. Ogle and Mrs. Ripon, if she oonld be found, along with tho young girl who was so tantalizing a flame to Tom, were to be the femile servitors at the mansion. \"My lord!\" \" You give way to a levity that does not become you; but if you wUl earn a couple of hundred guineas, in addition to all the ota-.r rewards that I hear are offered, and likewise .he gratitude of several great people, you wiU make short work of Captain Felix H^ron\" By this plan no strangers were 11 be a'lowed in the establishment. Wild shook his head. Edith had by this time improved a little npon the plan, for she had persuaded her aunt, Lady Castleneau, to say that she would pass much of her time at Whitcombe House, and bring with her Anthony and Martha, so that the establishment wat not to be a very weak one. Ogle was to explain the whole affair to Tom, and to Mortification, and to his wife, and he was likewise to ride Daisy to Edgewara to toon as the evening of that day fairly set in. In the meantime, Lord Clao_ inorton was using his utmost exertions to do all the harm he could \"You will not?'' \" I am a long way off from saying I will not, my lord ; but what I mean ia, that it is easier said than done \" \" Confound the scoundrel !\" Wild laughed. \" Well, my lord, I will do my best.\" \" Do so, and rest satisfied of the favour of thole whose favour gees even to the length of Use and death, should you ever be in a position to require it\" \" Many thanks, my lord. It wUl not be from the want of wUl that I shall fail, if I do, in placing Felix Heron in the hands of justice.\" Lord Clackington took a piach of snuff. He looked with all the _ly malice of an old baboon into the face of WUd to Felix Heron. For that purpose he thought he could not do better than call upon Jonathan Wild. It was- about three o'clock in the asterueon, therefore, of that eventful day tbat the carriage of my Lord Clackington halted at Little Newgate. The peal upon the knocker that the footman executed soon brought tbe janissary, who was \" on the lock,\" to his post, for he had been gos siping in the kitchen. \" Is \u2014 aw \u2014 Mister Wild at \u2014 aw\u2014 home ?\" asked tbe footman, with bis nose in the air. \" Pho. pho! What do you care abont jus tice ? KiU him I\" \" T mean to.\" \" Vas-y good ! A nice day, Mr. Wild. When Felix Heron is dead, bring that to me for my sig nature, which I will then instantly aitach to it.\" As he spoke, Lord Clackington placed a piece of paper in the hands of Wild. It was a cheque filled up all but the actual sig nature \" To be sure he ia, stupid !\" was the not over courteouo reply. \"Hia lordship's cawd!\" The footman banded in Lord Clackington. \"cawd ,\" as he called it. Jonathan Wild, however, who was in the house, beard the appeal at the knocker, and now made hia appearanoo. A glance at the \" cawd\" pretty well opened hit eyes in regard to the object of tbe visit of Lord Clackington, and he went out to the coach door. It read thua : \u2014 \" Pay Mr. Jonathan Wild or order the sum of five hundred ponads.\" Lord Clackington meant that blank cheque to be the death warrant of Felix Heron. \" 1 will do my best,\" said Wild, gloomily. \" But your lordship hardly appreciates the difficulties, I have, at times, had strange thoughts about him.\" \" About Felix Heron?\" \" Glad to see your lordship, at Little Newgate. Quite an honour.

Make way \u2014 make way, you rascals for my Lord Claokington!\" Wild led Lord Clackington to that room on the first floor where the reader has often seen the great thief-taker, and ceremoniously offered him a chair. \" Pho, pho !

It was all about the phea sants. They thoot 'em, and why shonldn't father ? But they shot father, too ; and what is to become of poor little Dick ?\" The boy began to cry again bitterly. \"Assure as fate,\" taid Ogle to himself, \"this is the son of the gamekeeper that Lord Bridge water talks about Hoy, my little man, who was your father?\" \" Under- keeper to Lord Bridgewater, he was.\" \" Ah, I thongbt so I I'm quite snre the Earl will provide for you, Dick.\" \" No, he won't.\" \" But I say he wUl !\" \"And I say he won't\" \" Why ?\" \" Because, though father wat an undSr-keeper, he was out with the lads that take game when they can get it, and so got thot!\" \" Ab, I begin to see now ! Nev/r mind, yon come along with me.\" \" Are you a keeper ?\" \u00bb No.\" The night bas come ! Dark and still, with now and then a dull, far off souod of thunder. The air had been too close and pretematuraUy calm the whole day not to threaten some rather violent change. Tbe clouds dropped low, and those birds, whose habits were nocturnal, flew lower than usual, and uttered discordant cries. \" Confound yon ! \" cried a horseman who had just got clear of the viUage of Kilburn, and up the hill beyond leading to the windmill, as a bat flew in hi) face \u2014 \"confound you I Can't you look where you are coming to !\" It was O^le who spoke. He rode Daisy. His errand was to a small estate which the Earl of Bridgewater owned close to Edgeware. Daisy was a littlx startled at the bat, whose leathery wings flapped ab^ut her eyes for a few seconds. \" Gently, Daisy, lass\u2014 gently I\" said Ogle. Daisy trotted along again composedly. Ogle, to tell the truth, was not very well pleased with the part he had to play in the drama which was got up for the purpose of impressing upon the enemies of Captain Heron the idea that be was no more. \" A poacher ?\" \" Sometimes.\" \" Then I don't mind going with you. Is that your horse yonder ?\" \" Yes, it is. There yon are, my Uttle chap ! AU you have to do is to hold en.\" \" Yes, I'll hold on. Where be you going to ?\" \"Not a wedding.\" \" Where to, then ?\" \" Perhaps a funeral Hilloa ! this won't do !\" Ogle had aU of a sadden bethought him that the expedition he was on, and the part he was to be in the proceedings of that night were not exactly suitable for the observation of the ton of the murdered keeper. The mere fact that death and Heron were as sociated together, was not pleasant to Ogle any more than it had been to Edith. But he trotted on. Behind him he had a bundle shaped like a valise, and strapped to the saddle. That bundle contained a complete suit of Cap tain Heron's clothes, such as he was wont to wear when he went out openly on the highway, or the common, to cry \" Stand and deUver ! \" to the King's lieges. To Daisy the trot to Edgeware was nothing, al though Ogle was not a light weight, and iu abont half an hour the little dim lights of the stUl old fashioned town were visible. \" I can't take you any further, little ohap,\" he said \" Here is half a crown. Get a night's rest somewhere, and in the morning yon go and speak to the Earl, and, you may take my word for it, he will do something handsome for yon.\" \" I wilL\" Ogle then drew rein. \" I must not overshoot my mark,\" he said. \" I was to meet somebody here at the milestone, just before getting into the town \" Ogle thought he saw a milestone, but he wat not quite sure in the darkness, and he dismounted to Bee it cloter. \" Good night\" \" Good night, and thank you for the half crown.\" Ogle rode on. Bnt the boy ran back and whistled. From the shadow of a hedge a man started ap and called to him. \"Come here, Dick. Who was that?\" \" I don't know.\" \" Did you cut away the valise?\" \" Yes.\" He started back ! It was not a milestone, elthough the object wasaboat the sane size, and looked dully white in the darkness. It was BomethiDg wilh Use. 'Hilloa!\" cried Ogle. \"Who, and what are you ?\" The sound of Bobbing was the only one that met his ears. \" Come on, then. It's snre to drop on the road, somewhere. Don't you be grieving about your father. Bless you, a sharp Uttle chap like you wiU find lots of fathers !\" It was quite evident that Dick, the son of the poacher and gamekeeper, was not disposed to grow grey with grief. What effect his encounter with Ogle was cal culated to have npon the fortunes of those persons in whom we are interested, will suflijiently soon be apparent. Ogle got over his first start, and bent low down, and touched the figure. \" Speak,\" he eaid. \" Tell me what's the matter with you, and who you are ?\" \"Nothing I nothing !\" It was the voice of a boy\u2014 almost a ohild\u2014 that broke upon the ears of Ogle- \"Oome, come, my litiluman,\" he said. \"lam quite euro something ia amiss- Are you hungry ?\" \" No, no !\" Ogle satisfied himself soon that he was at the mile-stone, where he was to wait for some one from the Earl of Bridg water, who would conduot him esaotly where he was to go."], [43, "EDITH HERON. 37 I It was at that mile-atone that Ogle found ont the fastenings of the valise like shaped bundle, that he had with him on the saddle, had been tampered with. want well done yon must do youraelf, always pro vided it does not invo've the exercise of tome special skUl or handicraft which can only be ac quired by pratice.

A small but strong iron chain of complicated links likewise fastened the bundle, so that although Dick had cut the straps cleverly enough, it had not fallen. \"So, so !\" said Ogle, \" that young ratcal is one of that sort, is be ? Only let me come np with him again, that's all !\" \" A nice night!\" cried a voice, suddenly. Ogle started. It was the first part of the signal agreed upon that wonld let him know he bad met with the right person. \" Not over to, my lord.\" \" Yon can guess what it is ?\" \" I think 1 oan.

Ogle followed, putting Daisy to at walk, and keeping the dim and dusky figure of the man in view. \" Come thfs way, then.\" The Earl led Ogle into another stable that opened from the first one, and then into a coach house, where, on some treasels, lay the coffin with the dead body of the gamekeeper. Ogle placed his hand on the bridle of Daisy, as he said, \" It's a pity, my lord, that she haa any thing to do with it\" \" She\u2014 who ?\" In a few moments they left all traces of a regular road, and trod upon soft turf, which seemed mightly to please Daisy. \" Ah I\" said Ogle, in a whisper, \" I suppose you think you are back again in old Epping.\" . \" Hush I\" said the guide. \"All right I\" \" Do not speak again until I address yon.\" Ogle was silent. There was a tone of authority about this mys terious guide which made Ogle think ttat, in aU probability, he was some one of consequence. The dull sound of Daisy's feet upon the grass was now aU that broke the intense stiffness of the night \" Daisy.\" \" Oh, the horse ! You quite startled me, Ogle. But why is it a pity ?\" \" She don't like it \" Daisy evidently hung back, and it was with great reluctance that she would cross the threshold of the coach-bouse. \" Leave her iu the outer stable, Ogle \" \" I will, my lord ; she wiU be safe enough, I daresay.\" \"Quite [quite I\" A footstep was heard approaching. Colonel Trelawney put his head in at the coach house door. Although, in truth, but seven or eight miles at the utmost from one of the prinoipal thoroughfares of London, the soUtude of that rural spot was complete. \" Halt !\" aaid the guide. Ogle paused. A gate was opened, which creaked a little npen its hinges, and then Ogle put Daisy into motion again, and rode throngh. The ground on the other side of the gate was gravel, and crumbled under the shoes of Daisy. \" He is here !\" cried the guide. \" In good time !\" said a voice Then there was a gleam of a stable lant\u00b0rn, and no other than the Earl of Bridgewater himseU ap peared.

Both the Colonel and Lord Bridgewater had seen enough of the world to know that what yoa \"I cannot persuade myself,\" he said, \"that there are not some persons in the meadows.\" \" Ah 1 so soon 1\" said the Earl. Ogle looked from one to the other of them, aa he said, \" Soon or late, my lord, I can say that I know there are persons about this spot, for an attempt has been made already to steal this bundle of the Captain's clothes.\" The Earl of Bridgewater looked disquieted ; but he felt the necessity of immediate action, and he said sharply, \" Then the sooner all tbat we have to do to-night here is done the better it wUl be. Ogle, there is your man : I will leave you a light.\" The Earl and Colonel Trelawney left Ogle alone with the dead gamekeeper. The screws of the coffin were loose, and a powerful screwdriver was ljing on the Ud, with which Ogle completed the task. It was, as Ogle afterwards 'aid, about tbe ugliest job be ever had in his life ; bnt be did clothe the dead body completely in the dress of Captain Heron he had brought with him.

But the dead man looked very ghastly indeed wish I had the author of it in my grip, that is all 1\" No one replied to this speech. \" What's o'clock, Swiney?\" \" Past ten, Mr. WUd.\" \" Ah ! I'm afraid the rascal wUl not show him- in tbat brave apparel. \" AU right I\" aaid Ogle, as he opened the door of the coach-house. \"Bring him out!\" \"How, my lord?\" \" Won't Daisy take him?\" \" I should say decidedly not\" \" Then, Trelawney, let ut have oat the black horse; he wiU not be so particular.\" Colonel Trelawney brought out of one of the loose stalls of the stable a black horse, and the dressed-up body of the dead man was placed upon It self. How far do you take it to be to Edgeware now?\" \" About half a mile, sir.\" \"Come on, then, gently.\" Wild and bis party rode on. \" Now,\" whispered the Earl of Bridgewater, \u2014 \"now it the time!\" They all emerged into the road, and the dead gamekeeper was let drop from the horse that car ried him on to the green sward close to the en trance to the lane. \" I wUl lead the way,\" said the Earl. \"Hush! What is that?\" A clock struck something in the distance. It was the hour of ten. \"We had need be quick,\" said the Earl ; \"for the anonymous letter to Jonathan Wild appointed thia hour.\" Daisy's bridle was then brought right over her head, and tied in a knot round the wrist of the dead man. Daisy did not see\"very well what was going on, but she planted both her fore feet before her, and got as far off from the dead man as she could. By Uttle successive jerks, then, she began to drag the body along the roadside. \" Now, Colonel I\" said the Earl. \" Shall I fire ?\" \" May I make to bold aa to ask what tbat letter was about?\" \"Yes, Ogle.\" \" Yes,\" added the Colonel. \" I think that who ever is trusted in any part of an affair Uke this onght to know all about it.\" \" So do I, Oolonol \u2014 so do I. Lend me the lan tern, and I will read Ogle a copy of the letter.\" Ogle waa rather glad that he was not asked to read the letter, since, as the reader has had occa sion to see before, that wat a branch of education in which he wat rather deficient \" Yes.\" Bang I went a pistol which the Colonel took from one of his pockets. A pause of only a couple of seconds was then allowed to take place, when he discharged the companion pistol. Bang! went the sharp report, and it mingled in the far-off distance with the echoes of the first one. The letter ran thus : \u2014 \" A friend informs Jonathan Wild that Oaptain Heron, the famous hichwayman of Epping Forest, intends to be on the Edgeware Road, not far from the town of Edgeware, to-night, to try hii fortune with one of the cross country mails.\" Then the Earl placed his hands before hia mouth in a peculiar manner, and uttered al oud and startling yell that mast have spread alarm wherever it was heard. It certainly spread alarm in the mind of Daisy. The pistol-shots she paid no attention to, for she was used to them. \" That is all,\" said the Earl. \"It is enough,\" responded Ogle. \" Wild wiU be here.\" But the unearthly cry that the Earl of Bridge water had thought proper to utter as part of his plan, did the business. Daisy started off at once. Towards Edgeware she went at a sharp half gallop, dragging the dead body at ber side by the bridle \" Yes, and at this time ; for written on the out side of the letter were the words, 'Not till ten o'clock.' \" Ogle sighed. \" What affeots yon, Ogle ?\" asked the Earl. \" Daisy !\" \"What of her?\" \" The idea that she is to get into the hands of snch a rascal as Jonathan Wild I\" \" Halt ! bold ! Form across the road ! Stop whatever and whoever thia is!\" shouted Jonathan WUd. \" That she shall not. The Oolonel and I in tend to ride np as if by accident, after Wild has made what he will no doubt think a wonderful discovery, and we will lay claim to Daisy.\" \" Do so, my lord, and my mind wiU be quite at ease.\" At the first pistol-shot he had faced abont. At the second, he had put his party to speed. At the strange cry that came npon the night air, he drew rein and waited. Then he heard the rapid approach of a horse. Of Daisy, although he knew her not Unaided by the intelligence of a rider on whom Fhe could depend, and who cohld bring out aU her latent intelligence to meet bis, Daisy fell into the kind of ambuscade that Jonathan Wild and his men had prepared hastUy across the road. \" It shaU be done. On, on, or aU our plans may be lost\" \" Thejt are lost!\" whispered the Colonel. While thus conversing in low tones, the little party, consisting of Oitle and Daisy, and the Earl and the Colonel, and the black hone with the tie at gamekeeper upon it, had reached the lane where road there was none bnt over the soft green sward. Just as they did to, there came np to it a party of mounted men. Half a dozen hands were on her bridle at once. A couple of dark lasterns were unmasked, and ahed two broad gleams of Ught npon the scene. It was a strange one. There was Wild, with a party of horse some half a dozen strong, and armed to tho teeth. And there was Daily. Her mane erect \" Halt 1\" cried the harsh voice of Jonathan Wild.

Her nostrils quivering with emotion, and stUl dragging at ber bridle tbe lifeless body of the gamekeeper. The gamekeeper, in the exact costume of Felix Heron, the highwayman.

Some horsemen on the road !\" Wild raised hia hat. A demoniac smUe lit np his face. Hit eyes gleamed like those of a decomposing fish by the light of the lantern, as he half-sang, half-shouted, \" Good night \u2014 a long good night to Felix Heron, Earl of Whitcombe, and some time the king of old Epping Forest!\" \" Is that him, Mr. WUd ?\" cried several of the janissaries, as they pointed to the body of the gamekeeper which had been dragged half over on to its side. The janissaries took up a strong position in two parties, one on each aide of the way ; and Jonathan Wild stood in the very centre of the road with a lantern in his hand. \" Halt 1\" he shouted. \" What for ?\" \" In the King's name !\" \" And who are you with such a word in your mouth on the highway ?\" \" I am the King'a officer t Halt, I aay ! There has been a highway robbery here, gentlemen.\" Wild added the word \" gentlemen \" on the horsemen\u2014 there were but two \u2014 coming within the influence of the Ught of the lantern he oar ried. Wild nodded. Wild laughed. \" Will you look at him in the face, Mr. WUd, and be sore?\" asked one. \"No!\" Wild laid hold of Daisy by the mane. \" This is my evidence \u2014 I am sure. This ia bis famous mare, Daisy. I have no need to look there, being quite sure about her.\" He pointed to the body as he spoke. But a couple of his janissaries had hastily dis mounted and ran to the dead gamekeeper, whom they turned on to hit back, and to whose face they held a lantern. They were both richly dressed and weU mounted. The reader knows them well. They were the Earl of Bridgewater and Colonel Trelawney, carrying out the next act of the little drama which was so completely confounding and deceiving Jonathan WUd. \" What is amiss here ?\" said the Earl, in a oold and haughty tone. Jonathan WUd then knew him. \"Dead?\" asked Wild. \"Quite, sir 1\" \"Ah!\" \" My Lord Bridgewater,\" he said, \" unless I am very much mistaken.\" \" Well, sir, what then ?\" \" Oh, my lord, not much, only that your friend Felix Heron \u2014 Captain Heron of Epping Forest \u2014 has been up to his old games, and baa somehow met with hia match.\" WUd drew a long breath. \" How ?\" \" Shot, sir.\" \"Of course!\" \" WiU you come and look at him, Mr. WUd ?\" \" Yes \u2014 no, no !

THE EARL OF BRIDGEWATER RESCUES DAISY FROM JONATHAN WILD, WHO REJOICES EX- CEEDINGLY. The vein of superstition that formed a part of the mental condition of Jonathan WUd began to come into action. \" No mistake about that, my lord.\" \"AndheiskiUed?\" He had a dread that if be looked into what he supposed to be the dead face of Felix Heron, he should see some impression there he might never be able to forget Jonathan was getting rather subject to bad dreams. \"Shot!\" \" Through the head,\" added one of Wild's men. \" You hear, my lord ?\" \" Good heaven !\" \" Amen !\" cried WUd, with a hypocritical twang that was not very unlike the tone in which the Reverend Mortification was in the habit of recom mending tinners to a certain hot place. That might mingle with them. \" No, no !\" he said again ; \" I don't want to see him !\" \"And the body?\" said the Earl. \" Oh, I have nothing to do with that\" \"And the horse?\" \" That, as a constable, I take up. Ha, ha !\" \"As a constable?\" As he spoke, he drew trom his pocket a clasped knife and, opening it with his teeth, as was his general habit, he out the bridle of Daisy, and re leased her from the enforced connexion with the dead body. \" Yes, my lord.\" \" Well, it seems to me that a magistrate has surely more power than a constable, and as I Bat be took good care that she shonld not get sway, for if he ever succeeded in compassing the"], [46, "EDITH HERON. 40 WUd looked at him sharply. \" I am, sir.\" \" Then you are wrong again.

My lord, and you, sir, since you are so mightily smitten with the highwayman's horse, may have tho highwayman himself. Ha! ha! I make you a free present of the dead man !\" Jonathan WUd liked to have the last word ; aud he now set spurs to his horse, and galloped off, sa aa not to hear any reply that might be made to him. His party of janissaries followed him. Now this waa just what the Earl of Bridge water and Colonel Trelawney wanted. Their whole effort was to bring the interview with WUd to exaotly this termination. happen to be in tbe commission of tbe peace, I wilt take the horse. ' You, my lord ?\" \"Just 80.\" Wild looked deeply mortified. \" Not only am I a magistrate,\" added the Earl of Bridgewater, \" but I am lord of the manor here; and the ground on which we now stand ia part of the manor.\" WUd looked like a fiend. He still held the bridle of Daisy. He glanced at his men as though the vague and desperate idea of making a fight of it and resisting the authority of the Earl of Bridgewater, had come across his mind. \" My Lord Bridgewater,\" he said with a con centrated bitternea* in his tone which he did not take the trouble to conceal, \" I know you well, and I know that yon have always been the friend and the upholder of Felix Heron, the highwayman 1\" \" Well ?\" said the Earl, calmly. \" The law,\" added WUd, \" calls it aiding, and abetting and comforting.\" \" Well ?\" \" That will do 1\" aaid the Earl. \" ExacUy 1\" added the Co'onel. They waited awhile, until the sounds of tbe horses' footsteps belonging to Wild and his party had entirely disappeared, and then the Earl caUed, \"Ogle! Oglel\" \"Here!\" Ogle came out of the shadowy apace by the road-side, where, out of the sphere of the rays of Jonathan WUd's lantern, he had been a witness to the whole affair. \"Take possesiion of Daisy again. Ogle, and ride to London You wUl find Felix Heron at Whitcombe House.\" \" It would not have run quite bo well with you, my lord, had you stood at the bar cf a criminal court to answer for snoh acts even as Edith, the wffe of that same Felix Heron, did.\" \" Perhaps not. Bat it's possible, Jonathan Wild, that Felix Heron might then have held your Use in his hands, and oargained for all future non inolestaiions of me and mine as he did in regard to Edith.\" The Earl of Eridgewater had an object in say ing thia much. He wanted Wild fully to comprehend that, although, to all appearance, Felix Heron was no more, the compaot that he had made with him, Wild, not to annoy or disturb Edith in any wav, was . no . n. Wild looked pale as the Etil spoke. \" So, my lord,\" he said, \" I aee you are deep in the confidence of the highwaymen \" \"Not particularly so. Felix Huron waj one of those open, generous souls who have no petty secrett 1\" \" Be it so. Have it your own way.\" \" I m\u00bban to do so.\" \" With pleasure, my lord ; and I don't think I ahould have had a moment's peace this night if Daiiy had remained in t_e hands of Wdd.\" \" One moment however,\" said the Earl, \" before you go. Ogle. Will you restore the dead body to the coffin from which you took it ?\" \" That wUl I. He was no acquaintance of mine. poor fellow; but I wUl do my best for him, as I would like to think some kind soul would do for me.\" Ogle was aa good as his word ; aud the dead gamekeeper having that night made himself so very useful \u2014 perhaps more useful in death than ever he had been in life \u2014 waa once more consigned to his narrow home, and firmly screwed down Ogle did not take the trouble to divest the body of the suit of highwayman's apparel belonging to Felix Heron ; to that for the future apeoulation of any one who might get, in the changes and mu tations of time, a glimpse of that dead body, the gamekeeper was doomed to go to the grave in the full dress of a knight of the road. Ogle then started for London. \" He took good care, however, aa he rode Daisy to take a different route from the ordinary high way, for he did not wish to encounter Jonathan Wild and his party. Ogle, therefore, went up one of the narrow, verdant lanes that led to Hampstead, and so reaohed London across those fields for so many years so well known to Londoners, but which now, alaa! are ahorn of all their beauty, and a prey to tbe buUder. It was at about half-past twelve o'clock at n'ght that Oa le drew rein at the door of old Whitcombe House, St. James's Street Felix Heron was there. The Earl laid his hand on the bridle of Daisy. \"Let me, however,\" added Wild, \"say this much\u2014 that there is not another magistrate of England who would take from a police-officer the horse of a highwayman whom he had oveic.me on the King's highway.\" \"Nor wiU I.\" \"Ah!\" \" I say, nor will I. Only show me that yon did overcome him, and the famous horse Daisy is yours.\" WUd bit hia lips. He was wondering how much the Earl knew cf the aotual circumstances, and how far, conse quently, he might have a chance of going to attempt to deceive him. \"Why,\" he said, \"the facts speak for them selves, my lord !\" \" They do, Jonathan Wild. You found the horse and the dead rider on the highway \u2014 but that is all the faot aa regards you!\" Wild let Daisy go. \" Take her,\" he said ; \" only I wish another magistrate was present, in which case I feel con fident the deoision would be in my favour.\" \"Are you sure of that, Jonathan Wild?\" said Oolonel Trelawney. Pacing the hall, he was waiting anxiously for Ogle to tell him how affairs had sped at Edge ware. Heron waa too weU acquainted with the sound"], [47, "41 EDITH HERON.

They both started. Daisy pricked np her ears. A loud single knock had come at tbe door o Whitcombe House. . Heron himself opened the massive street door. It was not prndent; for, although he might have been certain that it was the footstep of Daisy he heard, he could not be so certain of who waa on her back. Ogle bad dismounted. Not a sound was in the street. It was juat that hoar at which such a street was likely to te deserted at times for a full five minutes. \"Ogle?\" \" Yes, Oaptain.\" \" AU well ?\" Who could it be ? Neither Heron nor Ogle ventured to utter a word. Bang ! came the knock again. Heron whispered to Ogle. \" I suppose it is tome idle person who thinks it an amusement to knock at tbe door of an empty house.\" \" I will soon see, Captain,\" \"How?\u2014 how?\" \" ExceUent ! You are dead, and Jonathan Wild is ready to swear to it !\" \"Good!\" \" Oh, it was well managed !\" \" I do not doubt but it waa. Come in and tell me aU about it\" \" Daisy, Oaptain ?\" \" Bring her in.\" The hall was large enough to have driven in a coach and pair with ease, to that Daisy, hearing her master's voice, at once stepped across the threshold of Whitcombe House, and stood close to Heron in the hall, rubbing her head npon bis shoulder. \u00ab This way.\" Ogle was a big, brawny man, but he was strong and active ; and with a dexterity that, to look at him, no one would have supposed it possible he possessed, he climbed up by the back of the shut door to the fan-light above it. \"Ah, my gaUant Daisy,\" said Heron, \" I am aa well pleased to see you again as you can be to see me!\" The lock. The bolts. The fastenings of the two knockers. AU afforded Ogle some foothold, and he was soon able to look through the fanlight on to the doorstep. A glance seemed to be enough. Ogle rapidly descended. \" Who is it ?\" Ogle carefully closed and barred the door of Whitcombe House before he said another word to Felix Heron. \" Jonathan Wild.' CHAPTER CSOII. \" Ah I The villain ! What wants he here ?\" \" He has some deep design upon Whitcombe House, Captain, now that he thinks you are not in the world to thwart him in it\" \"No doubt! No doubt!\" JONATHAN WILD MEETS WITH A TERRIBLE FRIGHT, AKD GOES HOME IS A SAD PLIGHT. '\u2022' Now, Ogle, tell me all about it\" \" I will, Captain.\" Ogle, then, in hia short, terse way, related to Felix Heron aU that had taken place on the out skirts of the Uttle town of Edgeware. \" It was capitally done 1\" said Heron. \" Indeed it waa, Captain.\" \"And Jonathan WUd now. thoroughly believes -that I am no longer in this world ?\" \" You may depend, Captain, that he will go before the magistrates and make a declaration to that effect the first thing in the morning;, taking _ wonderful deal of credit to himself in the matter.\" Bang went the knock at the door again. Jonathan WUd had apparently made up bis mind to knock three times, and then to feel au as surance that no one waa in the house, In a few seconds more they heard that he waa fumbUng and rattling at tbe lock. Ogle whispered to Heron. \" He is trying his skeleton keys now.\" Heron nodded. \" The iron bar, though, will baffle him, Captain.\" \" Take it down, Ogle.\" \"What?\" \" Take it down, and let him make hia way in.\" \"But, Oaptain \" \" Hush !\" Jonathan Wild, from without, uttered a series of awful maledictions, for he was both surprised and disappointed that the door did not at once yield to him. Assuming no one to be in the house, tbe door could not be bolted, barred, or chained on ihe in side, so that the pick-look, which no one iu all the world could use with more skill than WUd, ought to clear the way for him easily. But the bar that Ogle had put up lay close to tbe panels of the door, and held it fast \" Fear nothing,\" aaid Heron, in a whisper, close to the ear of Ogle. \" I intend to give Jonathan Wild such a warning not to show himself in the hall of Whitcombe House again that he will not be likely to forget it w&re he yet to encumber the earth for a hundred years.\" \" Let him.\" A small lamp was burning in the spacious hall of Whitcombe House, and in the great extent of the place, and up the grand staircase, where many of the feeble rays were likewise dissipated, the lamp only produced a very dubious kind of twi light By that twilight, however, pile and indistinct as it was, Ogle could see that Captain Heron was full dressed, aa if for the road. \" Captain,\" he said, \" you don't surely mean to go out to-night ?\" \" I do, Ogle.\" \"And alone?\" \" No ; I thought of taking you with me. Ogle.\" \" AU's right, then !\" \"We must ride to Epping and back before the __or_iug.

We used to make odd noises in the night-time at Little Newgate on purpose to scare him.\" Never in all his life had Jonathan WUd met with a fright so terrible as this. Ogle enjoyed it immeniely. And to, in truth, did FeUx Heron. It was so easy to play the part of one's own ghost. But thia was a state of things tbat could not last long. No mortal could suffer what Jonathan Wild was suffering, and preserve his reason for another half minute. \" Indeed !\" \" Yes, Captain ; and he would come down stairs looking as white as a sheet, with his hanger in one hand and a Ught in tbe other, to know what it was\" \" Well, Ogle, take down that bar, so that he can open the door and get in, and I promise you he shall have a fright to-night such aa he has never yet had the ohance of having.\" WUd still rattled with the key in the lock of the Felix Heron pnt an end to it. \"Ho, Daisy I \u2014 forward! forward!\" If an} thing had been wanting to convince WUd of the full reality and identity of the appa rition, these words, in the weU-known voiGe of Captain Heron, would have been more than sufficient door. He stUl awore fearfully Cautiously and slowly Ogle took down tbe iron bar. While he was doing so Felix Heron mounted Dai6y, and stood with her exactly in the centre of the hall. They broke the speU at fear that sat upon hia limb and voice. With a yell that was something terrific, he turned and darted out of the hall. \"Good!\" said Ogle. Wild ran down St. James's Street like a hunted There he was in hia full costume, just as Jonathan Wild thought he had seen him lying dead by the road-side at Edgeware some two hours before. hare. A watchman, in his watch-box, was at the corner of Pall MaU. And mounted on Daisy, too, about whom there could be no mistake, for he, WUd, had had her ac tually by the bridle. Felix Heron always had rather a grave and thoughtful face, but now he composed it to a look of stern dignity, and kept hit eytt fixed npon the little lamp, so that there was a brightness from the reflection of it upon those eyes which Jonathan Wild could not fail to be struck with. Ogle took up suoh a position that when the door should be fairly opened he would be shielded by it And now Jonathan WUd found that whatever had hindered the operation of hia skeleton key hindered it no longer. The lock yielded. The massive door creaked gently upon its binges. Wild hardly knew what he did, but he seized the man by the throat and tore him ont of the watch-box in an instant, and then dashed into it himielf. But the watch-box was old and frail, and did not stand very firmly, so that as soon as Wild got into it, shaking as he was in every limb, it swayed about for a few seconds, and then fell over on to its face. Wild was a prisoner. The watchman sat on tho flag-itoaes, and sprung his rattle vigorously. \" Help I help ! Watch 1 watch ! A madman\u2014 a wUd b animal in the box ! Watch ! watch !\" We will now leave Jonathan Wild to hia horrors, and the other less important personages of our story to their various deviees, while we tnrn attention speciaUy to the situation of Felix Heron and Edith in the patrimonial mansion of the Whitcombes in St. James'a Street. Wild stepped lightly into the hall. Coming from the darkness without, it was very probable that tbe Uttle lamp in that hall, feeble as were its raya, appeared to him a very tolerable light At all events, it was enough to enable him to see all that the hall contained. And all that he saw was tbe equestrian figure in tie middle of it. A week has elapsed. One short week, and yet the changes in and about the house have been very great. Edith has, in her own proper character, as the Counsels of Whitcombe, taken possession of the mansion. T\" e i. an and the horse 1 The hopea and expectations of the friends cf her and Felix Heron have been so far justified, that no sort of annoyance or hindrance was even attempted, either by the Court or by the police authorities.

The King ceased to mention hia na\u0153o Even that vigorous old foe, the Lord Clacking ton, was now satisfied. And Jonathan Wild, although at times he would place himself on the opposite side of the way to Whitoombe House, in St. James's Street, and gaze at it with a strange and horrified look npon his face, did not attempt in any way to iu tei fere with Edith't quiet possession. The whole household, as had been agreed upon, consisted of Ogle, Mortification Ripon, Tom, Mrs. Ogle, and the young girl to whom Tom had so completely surrendered his affections. He wanted to scream. But hia tongue refused its office. The only sound that, by a great effort, he could utter, was a sort of hiss, such as some rattleinake in the agonies of dissolution might have pro duced."], [50, "EDITH HERON. 44 By tail plan the cfficious curiosity of strangers wa* entirely defeated. Ogle and Tom both had a horse in the atables. And Daisy occupied a loose sta'l to herself, and was specially a'tended to by Tom. In the care of ber little chUd Edith found that the hours were far from hanging heavy on her hands. It was indeed FeUx Heron, and tbat was one of the disguises in which he wai accustomed to visit Whitcombe House. It was a very perfect one. By its aid he had been able to walk down St James's Street and defy all recognition. AU traces now of the bent figure of an aged man vanished, aa the Baron straitened himself tip, and folded his arms abont Editb. The gladea and deep solemn shadows of old Epping Forest gradually faded from her mind, and she was almost happy. Almost only, because there was still the deep anxiety, that could never be forgotten, about the peril of Felix Heron. We will now look into one of the drawing rooms of Wtitcombe House in the dusk of the evening, and jast before the lights were ordered by Edith. 8he is there with her infant son, alone. \" Are we, then, alone, dear one ?\" \"Yes\u2014 oh, yes!\" \" Once more, then, in the home of my father that house which is so truly yours, and my own am I permitted to hold you to my heart, my Edith !\" \" Yea \u2014 oh, yet.

It is that he may Bee his father. The shadows deepen on the walla. The lights in the street send in faint gleams past the full, rich hangingsof the windows. StUl E iith will not call for light in the room. And the darkness begins to confnse objects. Then, with that preternatural aouteness of hear ing which enables us all to hear the lightest foot fall of those whom we love, and even tbeir very breathing, before they appear to our eyes, Edith was sure that Felix Heron was close at band. arms. \" The little one grows like you, my Edith\" \" Aud you, too, Felix.

Yea ; Edith felt certain it was her husband. The room-door opens, and Tom Ripon appears. \"The Baron Von Peck, my ladyl\" Edith could scarcely speak. \" Let him come in.\" \" You have seen my aunt, Lady Castleneau Felix ?\" \" I have, and she is well.\" A stout, elderly man crossed the threshold of the room. Felix Heron sat down by the side of Edith, with a sigh. \" You are unhappy, Felix ?\" \" No, no ! It it only the necessity that I have of leaving yon at times. That is all.\" \"But why do so?\" \" Do you not remember, dear Editb, tbat I am a highwayman?\" \" Oh, be one no longer 1\" \" I oannot yet afford to be so ttriotly good. You know, Edith, that the tenants of the Whitcombe estate have one and all refuted to pay any rents whatever, to anybody, until the question of the succession to the title and propeitiet is settled.\" \" Yes, I know that, Fehx.\" \" Well, dear one, we mn\u00bbt not only have funds to pay our way with, but an ample aam in reserve in case of any reverse of fortune.\" \" My Aunt Castleneau wiU help ua.\" \" Alas! thy is not rich.\" He wore a wig of foreign make, of a dull iron grey colour. His huge moustaches were of the shade of wood ashes, and perhaps justly so, as probably that was the substance tbat was upon them. His complexion had an aged, saffron sort of hue. His dress consisted of a blue surtout, with im mense skirts ; horseman's boots, and a vest, the great flaps of which reached nearly to the tops of those boots. In one hand he oarried a large, heavy walking cane. In the other, a rather old, three-cornered hat, without any ornament whatever. Such was the aspect of the Baron Von Peok, as he made his appearance at the door of that drawing-room in Whitcombe House. Tom closed the door. \"Not rich?\" And then any one who could have seen Tom would have been much surprised at what he was about It seemed so strange to Edith to think that any one could be in want of money, that she listened to what Felix Heron was saying with an almost childish kind of interest He sat down on the first stair of the second flight, and holding his sides, he laughed with a sdent chuckle, and with so many convulsive throes and grimaces to keep himself from making a noise, that the wonder was he did not burst oat right But the Baron Von Peck walked a few paces into the apartment CHAPTER OXOII. EDITH MAKES THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THB PRINCESS DEMIDOFF, AND HERON TAKES TO THE ROAD. He did not speak. Then Edith, with a ory of joy, sprang forward. She flung ber arms about tbe Baron, as ahe ex claimed, \" Felix I my Felix I\" A silence of some few moments' duration en sued between Edith and Felix Heron."], [51, "EDITH HEROH. 45 I He had .. p... 1 1 1 1 Li 1 cujjaiuuiciUuii to make. And she felt that he hid. Heron wai preparing Editb for ibe necessity that existed for his again going on the road. To E lith that was a dire and aad necessity, and yet ahe knew not in truth, how to combat with it. Heron held her hand gently in his. \"Be under no apprehension, my Editb; I will seek no danger, as in old times. When I was alone in theworld, I was wontto do so for danger's sake ; but I will not see you in want of hose abundant fonds which you ought to possess\" Edith started. \"Oh. let me be! Ob, let me be I\" cried the lady, in imploring accents. \" I wUl not trouble you, and why should you follow me, and seek again to make me your victim ?\" \" Bri-ag her along,\" said the harsh voice. \"Take her direct to the old stairs at Westminster, and we will have her do *n the river with the ebb tide, and on board the il jop for Flushing, quickly enough. Tbe lady screamed again. Felix Heron was quite satisfied. He made up his mind, there and then, that the lady, be she whom she might, should go on board no sloop tbatnigbt except by her own free will. Advancing with the ladder, Felix Heron swnng it round his bead, at a height of about live feet fr< m the ground. Down went the group of persons who were 6urrounding the sedan chair, as though struck by a flash of lightning. The lady and tho sedan chair, in the depths of which she still remained, were left in possession of the field. The sound of some tumult in the street came npon their ears. There was a shrill scream, in a fema'e voice. A cry, then, of \"Watch\u2014 watch \u2014 watch !\" was raised. Felix Heron went out on to the balcony of the house, and looked down to the street A sedan ch dr was upon its siCe, and several men were about it ; but whether in strife or in amity he could not tell. The question, however, was 60on settled by a loud exclamation in a it-male voice. The sudden disappearance of a'l her foes seemed to striko the lady with astonishment \" Ah, sir !\" she said, as she looked up from the sedan, \" to whom am I indebted for this speedy release?\" \"No \u2014 no! Never again \u2014 never again ! lam free now, and to your tyranny I wiU never again subject myself !\" 'Bring her along!\" shouted a man's voice \" Force shall settle that point!\" \" Help ! ch, help !\" \"Oa, what is it all about, FoUx?\" wM.psred Edith * That matters little, madam,\" replied Heron \" in comparison with your making good u^e oi your freedom. If you have anywhere to fly to for refuse from these men, do so before they re cover and again molest you.\" \u25a0 Alas ! a'as !\" \"Some one is in peril.\" \" Who \u2014 who ?\" The lady began to sob bitterly. Some chance passengers, too, in the streei, although it had happened that when the attack oi the sedan chair took plac# it was singularly quisS and deserted, began to hasten np. \" De;ide quickly, madam,\" oried Heron: \" when. can you go?\" \"Nowhere now; I am helpless.\" \" Not qiite,\" said Heron. Before, then, any one could actually reach tht place where the fracas, that, in truth, bad not occupied a fourth of the time that it has neces sarily consumed in the telling, Felix Heron caught the lady in his srms from the wreck of the sedan chair, and at once carried her into Whit coombe House. \" I know not, Edith ; but for your aa'ae, as it is a lady, I must interfere.\" \"Nay, Felix. What if it be but a snare to draw you from the house to your destruction ?\" \" If it be a snare, let those beware who lay it!\" The tone in which Felix Heron spoke convinced E lith that opposition would be little heeded even from her, since hit feelings were excited on behalf of the lady in distress below. But still, with a fear that he might be but rush ing on his destruction, Edith clung to him Heron folded her in hia arms for a brief moment. \"Fear nothing I fear nothing, my Edith! I will be doubly, trebly careful cf myself, for all our sakes.\" Heron then ran down the grand staircase of Whitcombe House. He closed the door. \" Here at least, madam, you are safe.\" So quickly, so adroitly wai this act completed on the part of Felix Heron, that by the time tbe passengers in the street ran up. aud some of the party that had been prostrated by the ladder had recovered from the knock-down blow, and looked about them, the disappearance of the lady was effected, and no one, iu the semi- darkness, could say where she had gone. The sound of angry voices began to be heard La the street In the hall was a short ladder that Tom Ripon bad left there for some purpose, and as the eyes of Heron fell npon it, an odd idea took possession of him. What a capital weBpon, he thought, would this be for the sudden dispersion of a crowd of people at once. He seized the ladder. He opened tbe outer door, and sallied out into the street Some four or five men were about the prostrate sedan chair, the bearers of which had ran off in fright It waa quite the custom of the chairmen, aa they were named, to run off and leave their fare to fight his own battles in case cf a fracas of any k., d. They knew perfectly well they would find the sedan chair where they had left it. And in this case the lady who called help had been so deserted. \"Save me! save me!\" aaid the lady, in accents of distress, as she clung to Heron. \"Do not let them take me.\" \" You are quite safe.\" \" Will they not force an entrance to this house ?\" \" No. They know not that yon are here, and should they suspect it any force they may raise could be met with a fully sufficient resistance.\" \" How can I thank yon ?\" \" Do not attempt to do so. The service has been eaaily tendered. I only hope it is a signal one.\" Felix Heron paused for a moment or two.

I am the Princess Demidcff !\" \" Demidoff ? That ia a R useian title, surely ; and yet yon speak the purest English !\" \" I am English. I am the daughter of the Honourable George Clackington.\" \" You are, then, the niece of tbe lord of that \" Your late husband !\" exclaimed the Princess Demidoff. Edith sighed. She liked not the deception she was forced to practise; but still, as it was necessary for the safety of Felix Heron, she would not shrink from it name ?\" \" Pardon me,\" added the Princess. \" Yonr loss must be much, and I do wrong to allude to it For my own part, I found, npon reaching Russia with the Prince Demidoff, that aU the restraints of civilized Use which he had been compeUed to put on in thia country, vanished, and I waa yoked to a fearfnl savage.\" \" But how did yon escape ?\" \" In the dress of a peasant I made my way through many dangers till I reached England ; but on this night, when on my route to a lady whom I am sure wUl afford me protection, I was met and attacked in the street by the emissaries of the Prince Demidoff, and bnt for this gentleman, the Baron \u2014Baron \" \" I am.\" \" I cannot congratulate yon, madam, on your uncle.\" \" Ab, you know him ?\" \" Too well.\" \" And I, too \u2014 and I, too; for it was by bis means, and in consequence of his despicable arts, that I was obliged to wed the Russian Prince, Demidoff, who was about two years since the Ambassador from the Court of St. Petersburgh here. Ob, what sufferings I have gone through since then!\" The lady began to sob and cry at the reeoffec tion of what she had endnred. \" Von Peck I\" said Heron, \" Yes, the Baron Von Feck, I should have been carried off to pass a Use of long imprisonment \" Yon are safe here, Princess, I am sure,\" said Heron ; \" for your foea have evidently not the leaat idea of where you are.\" \" Thank heaven ! thank heaven and you, Baron ! I intend to make an immediate appeal to the Queen, who is, in fact, the lady of whom I spoke, whose protection I was this night abont to seek.\" \" Then my advice to you,\" aaid Heron, \" is to delay seeking it until morning, when in the broad open face of day no one will dare attack you in the streets of London.\" FeUx Heron lingered in the hall of Whitcombe House only so long aa to feel quite aure that the mob of persons who had assembled about the sedan chair, as weU as tbe men who had sought to capture and carry off the young Princess Demidoff, had dispersed. Then he spoke to her in a low, gentle tone. \" Follow me, madam, and I will take yon to a lady who wUl be to yon a more efficient protector than I can.\" Felix Heron waa desirous of at once introducing the yonng Princess to Edith ; but he was by no means aa yet in the mood of letting her know who he really waa. Preceding her, then, by a few paces, he opened the drawing-room door, and said aloud, \" The Baron von Peck has the honour to introduce to the Countesa of Whitcombe the Princess Demi doff I\" As he spoke, Heron rose, and oeremoniously bowed to Edith and the Princess Demidoff. Bat he gave Edith a look that let her know he would fain speak with her. \" Princess,\" said Edith, \" may I make so good a friend of you as to leave you alone for a few moments.\" Heron knew that by shaping the introduction in those words, Edith would know that he meant to keep up hia incognito. Tom R'pon had lit one of the chandeliers, so that there was sufficient light in the room for Edith and Felix Heron to behold in the Princess Demidoff one of the most charming ladies they had ever seen. \"How can I be alone,\" said the young Princess, \"with this charming companion?\" She alluded to tho chUd, who was fast asleep in the depths of one of the chairs in the room. Edith and Felix Heron now held a short con ference in an adjoining apartment, the object of which may be explained in the few words with which Heron commenced the brief conversation. Her absence in Russia during the brief period that Felix and Edith had shown themselves at the Court of St. James's had accounted for her not knowing anything about them but by repute. \" Edith, thaU we trust this lady ?\" That was the idea that took possession of tbe mind of Felix Heron on this occasion. At the sound of the name of Whitcombe the Princess started. He waa naturaUy of so trustful a dispositien that he was always inclined to seek the way to the hearts of people by confidence, in preference to any other mode. But the proposition was one from whioh Editb ahrunk a little. \" Is it possible,\" she said, \"that I am indebted to the lady who has suffered so much from my bad uncle for hospitality this night, when I am so much in want of it ?\" \" I am the Countesa of Whitcombe,\" replied Edith. It was only, however, on one ground tbat she could nrge the shadow of an objection. Was the lady really what she represented her lelf to be ? That was the only question. Poor Edith had Buffered so much, and so, in truth, had Felix Heron, by the moat elaborate deception, that their honest, trustful natures had received a shook. \" Dare we so rapidly,\" aaid Edith, \" come to a conclusion in regard to this lady ?\" \" We ought not\" \" That is my seeling, FeUx ; and yet I may at The yonng Princess took Edith by the hand, and pressed it to her lips as she added, in a voioe of emotion, \" Grant me your protection, madam, for yon see before you one of the most nubappy persons in all tbe world.\" \" I freely do so,\" replied Edith, who was much taken with the beauty and amiable simplicity of manner of the Princeaa. \" And help me, too, to thank this gentleman, who resoued me from my enemies.\" \" The Baron von Peck is a gaUant gentleman,\" aaid Editb, \" and only second to my late hus-"], [53, "47 EDITH HERON, tbe aame time say tbat I am inclined fully to believe every word that she baa uttered.\" \"And I too. But yet, Edith, how shall we prove her truth ?\" \" I can think of bnt one test.\" so soon as I can get into the presence of the Queea who knows me weU, and who, I think, loves mo as much as her nature wUl permit her to love any one.\" \" That is easily accomplished,\" said Heron. \" I wiU undertake to convey you in safety to Buck ingham House, where, I presume, the Qaeen will be found.\" \"What is that?\" \" She ia alone with our chUd. From this room we have an opportunity of looking into that where she is, and of noting ber conduct while she thinks herself unobserved. If she is deceiving na, you may depend Felix, she will be in thought, and paying no attention to the little one.\" Felix Heron pressed Edith's hand in approval of thia plan, which was so essentially feminine and feasible, tbat he was quite willing to abide by it The young Princess was now thoughtful for a few moments, and then, with a face of animation, she looked up and spoke. \" Out of what looks like evil how often springs good. I shall, in defiance of the Prince Demidoff, remain in the protection of the Queen, and in that position I shall be able faithfully to let yoa both know all tbat posset at the Court in which it may be supposed you have any concern, as well ag gradually, I hope, influencing the Qaeen herself in your favour.\" Both Felix and Edith felt that it waa no slight thing to have inch an aUy at the Court and abont the Qaeen, to that they, too, were of opinion that ont of the attack which the Prince Demidoff and bis gang of miscreants had made on the young and charming Princess, much good was likely to arise to them. Hand in hand they stepped cautiously to the door of tbe drawing-room. They could look in and command a good view of whatever was doing in that apartment. The Princess Demidoff was standing by the aide of the large arm-chair, on which tbe Uttle one slept. They heard her speak in a low, plaintive voice. \" May heaven shower on your inntcent head its choicest blessings, for your mother's sake !\" Those words were decisive. Heron now left the room and summoned Ogle. \" Arm yourielf weU,\" he said. \" I have a lady to escort acroaa the Park to Buckingham House. I think yon and I can do so easUy.\" \" All right, Captain. Are we likely to be at tacked?\" Both Edith and Felix Heron felt that they re quired no other test of the sincerity of tbe cha racter and motives of the Princess Demidoff. They did not say a word to each other, bnt they exchanged looks wbech folly spoke all tbey thought Another moment, and they were in the room to gether. The yonng and lovely Princess roae hastily There was a look of charming candour on her face. \" It ia possible!\" \" Then I shall take a hanger with me, which I can eaaUy dispose of under my coat\" \"Do so.\" In the course of a quarter of an hour there issued forth from Whitcombe House three persons. Captain Heron, Ogle, and the young Princess Demidoff, to whom Edith had lent a cloak and a hat which materiaUy helped to disguise her. They passed into St James's Park by the side of Marlborough House, and proceeded along one of the tide walks to Buckingham House, which stood where the palace of that name now stands The Park was very dark, as the night was cloudy, and it was very inefficiently Ughted. Felix Heron spoke to the Princess in a low tone. Edith approaohed her, and took both her hands in hers. \" I am convinced,\" she said, \" you will be my friend.\" \" Only show me what I can do to make myself worthy of the title 1\" \" I wiU show you, dear Princesa, tbat I have faith in you by trusting you with the most im portant of secrets to me and to mine.\" Edith turned round as she spoke, and, taking the hand of Felix Heron, she aaid, \" This is my husband !\" \" It will be a great solace to my poor Countesa, Edith, to see you at often as you will visit her ; for tbe only female frienda she has.are the Coun tess of Bridgewater, whom you, doubtless, know, and her dear annt, the Lady Castleneau.\" \" Your dear Countess, then, lives nnder no dis guise, and I may visit her frankly and freely I\" \" You may indeed.\" It might have been the low, murmuring sound of this brief conversation that attracted attention, or else people were on the watch for whoever might be passing along the MaU of the Park ; but be the immediate cause what it might, a tall, barly looking man suddenly emerged from behind a tree, and confronted, with more valour than discretion, FeUx Heron and bis Uttle party. \"Halt!\" \" Your husband, Countesa ?\" \"Even ao !\" \"The Baron von Peck?\" \" Yes ; the Baron Ton Peck to toe world, bnt to me, Felix, the Earl of Whitcombe.\" In a moment Het on had lifted off the wig he wore, and stood at hit fuU height, with a smile upon hia face, and his young and handsome head in full relief. \" Is this possible ?\" \" It is true, Princesa,\" said Heron. \" In me you see tbe proscribed E.rl of Whitcombe, who is compelled to assume a disguise, in order to viait his own bouse.\" The Princesa held out her band, which Heron took. \" Ah!\" she said, \" allow me to say that, if by any means I can prove to yon both my feeling of gratitude, that moment wiU be to me a very, very happy one.\" \" We feel sure of it,\" repUed Heron. \" At pre aent, we are only in a position to wait and hope ; and the question is uppermost in onr minds as regards what good we can do to you ?\" \" I am certain of an asylum, and a safe one, too, \"What for?\" asked Heron, mildly. \" Juat beoause I say so.\" \"Indeed!\" \" Come here, Jaoks, oome here !\" \"Who is it?\" said another man, making his appearance. \" Who is it, Wills, my boy ?\" \" I don't know ; bnt one of this lot is a woman, and it's jsst as weU we shonld make sure of wh\u00bb abe is, aa weU aa who she is not\""], [54, "48 EDITH HERON. The Princess Demidoff shrunk back, aa ahe whispered in alarmed accents to Heron, \" I know those voices 1\" \" I am forced by my foes to be what they will not let me cease to be.\" \" A highwayman, Captain ?\" \"Just so.\" \" Yon do ?\" \" Yes. They are tbe men who attacked me in the street. \" I am right glad to hear it Do not stir from this place.\" \"No, no!\" Heron darted forward and caught one of the ruffians by the throat, as he said, in a calm voice, \"WeU met, Mr. Wills. I am delighted to see yon !\" By an exertion of tbat great strength that on occasions be could put forth to the surprise of every one, Heron, lifted the feUow fairly off his feet and flung him over the iron raUs of the Palace garden. A crash and a yell showed that he had fallen upon some wood-work, most likely some fancy rustic chair, and that he had demolished it as weU aa himself. \" Well, I don't know that there is a better thing for a distressed gentleman to do than that \" \" I must do it.\" \" And with Daisy, why who can say nay to yen on road or on common ?\" \" True, Ogle ; and since it is from the Court, and the myrmidona and sycophants of the Court, that I have received wrong and neglect, why I intend that they shall find out what it is to exchange the quiet and peaceable Earl of Whitcombe for Oaptain Heron, the knight of the road.\" \" Capital, Captain ; capital ! I rather fancy they wiU regret the change.\" \" I will take good care they shall, for I will make the road from here to Windsor, and to the White Lodge at Richmond, and to the Palace at Kew, too hot to hold the minions of the Court\" \" Bravo! bravo!\" The other ruffian, who had answered to the name of Jacks, made a blow at the back of Heron's head with a bludgeon, bat Ogle was by far too wide awake and active to permit such an attack to be effective. \" It is on that bit of road that I intend to carry on a commerce that will be profitable in purse, and no donbt will in adventure.\" \" I am delighted to hear it.\" \" Alone I shall be able to spread terror in the Court, aud in the mean hearts of those who live and fatten on its intrigues.\" \" Alone, Captain ?\" ' \" Yes, alone ; and yet I ought not to aay so, since I shall have with me my gaUant Daisy.\" \" Hem I\" Ogle made a leap right on to the fellow's back, and held the cudgel up above his head in the air just as he bad poised it for the blow. \" Not so fast, if you please,\" said Ogle. The fellow thought that sure'y whatever was npon his back had come down from the clouds there, or if his imagination was not equal to so high a flight at that, he thonght that from one of the trees the tndden attack had come. \" You are dissatisfied, Ogle.\" \" Well, Captain, to teU the honest truth, I did hope that I should aeccompany you.\" \" No, no ! That cannot be, for one good and special reison.\" \" What is that Captain ?\" \" I should never be able to f el my mind at ease in regard to tbe safety of Edith if I had not the assurance tbat you were at Whitcombe House while I was absent from it\" Down he 'ell with a roar of consternation. Ogle dealt him two or three heavy kicks, and then standing on his back fae said, \"I think, Captain, that wiU do ; and we can jog on quietly now.\" \" Certainly, Ogle.\" AU this had happened in such a moment that the Princess Demidoff hardly knew which way the conflict had gone, although she had very little donbt whioh way it waa likely to go. When, however, Heron offered her his arm again she was violently trembling. \" Calm yourseU, Princess,\" he said ; \" there is nothing to fear, and I think that this is rather a luoky encounter than otherwise, for those two fellows, who I take it are abont the boldeat of thoae by whose aid the Prince Demidoff seeks to get you into bis possession again, will think twice before they engage in any enterprise against you.\" The Princess, however, found it very difficult to get over the nervout agitation that had taken pos session of her, and Captain Heron was right glad to see her in safety within the gate of Buckingham House, where 'her name procured her immediate admission. There was a reason that Ogle was not able to combat with. \" Be it so, Captain,\" he said ; \" I only Uve to do you service.\" \" I know it, Ogle\u2014 I know it\" Captain Heron, without any special design in so doing, but became he waa busy in thonght, sat down on one of the benches of the Park, beneath a wide spreading old elm tree. Ogle sat by him. The Park was very still, and Heron was abont to say something, when they both saw a couple ef figures coming slowly np the old Mall. There waa something about the gait and air of these persons that had, to the eyes of Heron, dimly as he could only see them, an aspect of iamfliarity. And yet he conld not name them. Aa the bare, shadowy forms slowly advanced, Heron spoke to Ogle in a whisper. \" Do you know those people?\" \"No, Captain.\" \" Let us get into the shadows of the old tree.\" They rose from the bench, and quickly passing behind it they were both hid from observation in the deep, blaok shadow cast by the huge trunk of the old elm. CHAPTER CXCIII. CAPTAIN HERON HOLDS A CONSULTATION WITH OGLE IN THE PARK. \u2014 AN ADVEHTURE. Oolk and Felix Heron walked slowly along the Mall in St. James's Park, after disposing of the young Princess Demidoff in safety. \" Ogle,\" said Heron, \" I wish to talk to you of what kind of life I mean to lead.\" The two shadowy-looking figures slowly ad vanced.

He put his feet at full length upon the bench, so (hat there was barely room for that companion to sit down. When he did, too, it was in close contact with the boots of Jonathan Wild That one was Jonathan WUd. Bat the person who waa on that night in the Mall of old St. James's Park with the great thief taker was humble, and put up with aU and every thing. He quietly took possession of the extreme corner of the benoh, and rubbed his hands slowly one over the other. Who the other was remained for a short time a mystery. Bat it was only for a few minutes that they were in doubt about his identity. \"I am fagged and weary,\" said Jonathan Wild.

It was WUd who spoke again the first. \"I tell yon what it is, Deuce Ace,\" he said. \" I am sorry to have found yon still alive !\" \"What?\" \" I did not intend to offend you \" \" Pshaw t what care I what such a thing as yon can aay ?

He soareely knew why he did so, bnt it was per haps from the consciousness which could not fall to be perpetually present to him that he had com mitted crimes enough to be always in danger.

Moreover he felt conscious tbat he had been, in not the most disoreet manner, giving some of bis thoughts to the night air. It wat possible, then, that this mysterious stranger, who had come from he knew not where, might have overheard a something that was bad for any one to know but bimsdf, John Tarleton. \" Hum ! A cool night,\" said Tarleton. The dim and dusky-looking figure on tbe seat made no reply. \" I aaid it was a cool night, sir.\" Still no antwer. The latter then sat down upon the benoh again, and soliloqu'zed upon what had passed. \" Here e a pretty go ! Jonathan Wild has taken a nice turn, I do think ! That feUow Heron out of the way, and my sister left with only a little child ! Why, I might have worried her life out, an't got as muoh money out of her aa I wanted !

I Fortune favoured the trick which Felix Heron was trying to put upon John Tarleton, and helped him at that moment to make it as effective as pos sible. way to walk right over the back of John Tarleton again. Heron left the Park by that little gate at Spring Gardens ; and then he paused, and listened to the clock of St Martin's Cnurch as it struck the hour of twelve One of the windows of St. James's Palace\u2014 a window that looked out into the garden and bo on to the waU of the Park\u2014 was at that moment opened, and a curtain being held aside by some one in the room, a long ray of light Irom a cande labera came right over the trees and shiubs of the garden of the Palace. The ray of light happened to have found its way into the Park, between the elm trees. It then feU npon the bench where was seated Captain Heron and his most unworthy brother-in la;?, John Tarleton. \" Midnight, Ogle.\" \" Yes, Captain.\" \" Do you think you could manage to bring Daisy here?\" \" Of course I oan.\" \" Take this, then, to Edith ; and when you have delivered it to her, get Daisy out of the stable, and ride ber to this spot\" \" Yes, Captain.\" Felix Heron wrote, on a lens of a pocket-book be had with him, the following words in pencil: \u2014 The ray of light rested on the wooden bench, as nearly as might be between them. But the moment Captain Heron saw it, he made up his mind to take advantage of it before it thonld disappear, as it no doubt would, quickly. A alight movement brought him right into the ray. \" My Editb, fear nothing. Rest in peace and security, as it may yet be some hours before I can return to yon and our dear little one. \"Felix'' He then turned his face full toward! John Tarleton, and lifted bis bat from his brow, so that there should be no mistake about who he was. Tarleton was transfixed with horror. Heron tore the leaf out of his pocket-book that contained these words, and handed it to Ogle. Then he stood in the depths of a dark door way, and watched the arrival of Daisy. Ogle had not ventured to say another word to Captain Heron about accompanying him after wnat had already passed between them on that subject ; but it was a sore disappointment to him that he was not permitted ao to do. In about ten minntea, the sound of a horse's feet announced to Heron the approach of Daisy. There was something about hei Ught, springing tread tbat he waa alwayt able to recognise. Another minute, and she wat by hia side- But Heron wat surprised to see that it waa Tom Ripon who rode her. \" Why, Tom, what has become of Ogle ? He waa to ceme back.\" Jonathan Wild had told him that Felix Heron waa dead \u2014 that, in fact, he had seen his body \u2014 that afterwards he had had a visitation from the other world in the likeness of Felix Heron. And there was that likeness looking him in the face on the bench in tbe park. The blood paused in the veins of John Tarleton for one fleeting instant of time, and then he ut tered a yell of fear and feU forward on bis face to the ground. \" Beware !\" said Heron. But John Tarleton had fallen into a swoon, and was then past any more frights or warnings. Heron turned ronnd and called to Ogle. \" Here, Captain.\" \" I fancy I have made aome impression on the feara of this scoundrel.\" \" Yes, Captain ; but he told me to say that there was a suspicious-looking feUow on the other side of the way, in St. James's Street, looking at the house, so ne did not like to come away.\" \" He was right \u2014 he was right !\" Heron stood by tbe side of Daisy, with his arm thrown over her neck, and considering whether he shonld abandon bie intention that night oi riding forth in search of adventures or not \" It looks like it, Captain.\" \" Don't stand on his back, Ogle.\" Ogle coughed. He had pretended, quite by accident, to step on to the back of Tarleton ; bnt now, at the order of Captain Heron, he got off, and only dealt him a hearty kick or two. \" Let him alone, Ogle ; let him alone.\" \" All right, Captain.\" \" I don't think he will now venture npon the villanous plan that he spoke of a- while ago.\" \" I tell you what it ia, Oaptain,\" aaid Ogle. \" You don't know what a fellow like this is capa ble of, after his fright wears off.\" \" It is true.\" \" One person only, was it, Tom?\" \" Only one, Captain.\" \" Did you see him ?\" \" Oh, yes ! I pointed him ont to Ogle ; but upon our going over the way, he went into one of the houses \" \" Probably it is nothing. Some one, ont of idle curiosity, owing to the lights in the house ao long deserted, I fancy.\" \" That's abont it, Captain ! I think so. I fanoy one man ia enough at the manaion.\" \" What do yon mean, Tom ?\" \" Ob, I forgot old Daddy Mortification ! There's two, after all, without me.\" \" Tom, I can ase what you want ?\" \"How?\" \" Then let me hang him.\" \"No, no! Bnt I will go this far, Ogle. If at any time, when I am absent from home, yon should find the peace and safety of Edith and onr little one assailed by this man, or by any other, I give you free leave to act in tbeir defence as you may think proper.\" \" Good I I can take on myself to say, Captain, that if he doea pay ns a visit at Whitcombe House, it will be the last, aa well aa the first I\" \" I have no donbt of it Come on, Ogle!

I cannot burden Daisy with ns both to-night.\" \" No need, Captain, \u2014 no need ! \" \"Why so? You cannot keep up with me [on foot, Tom. I am bound for the high road to Kew.\" ___ Heron walked rapidly down the Mall, towards Spring Gardens ; and he was followed by Ogle, who found it, or thought be found it, tbe nearest --71."], [59, "53 EDITH HERON. \" No, <_ aptain ; I don't say I could. But do you bear nothing ?\" \" I hear some one ; and have heard it for the last few minutes, pertinaciously knocking at a door.\" The facilities for some bold and daring robbery at that spot, a_.d for an immediate escape, were great. There wit but one objection, end that was one that had recently only arisen. The turn pik' -gate waa, with its light and ita little hut where the pi&eman resided, very close at hand. \" That's my horse, Captain.\" \" Your horse ?\" \" Oh, yes ! You see. Captain, when Ogle told me to bring Daisy to you, I brought my own horse too ; but, for fear you should not like it, I led him to the knocker of a door, np yonder, close to Spring Gardens; and I suppose he keeps pelling it, and knocking away.\" \" Take that I\" shonted a voice at the moment. The fact was, that in order to interrupt vehicles and horsemen crossing the road and make them pay a toll, the gate had been moved a good fifty y a cs closer to the head of the shady lane. Captain Heron, when he aaw that this arrange ment bad been effected since he had visited the epot, came to a halt Splash came a quantity of water from an upper window of the hoase, to the knocker of which Tom Ripon had fattened his horse's bridle. Captain Heron could not help laughing. \" Come on, Tom,\" he said \u2014 * come on, in the name of heaven, and don't let us have the watch upon ua.\" Rap! rap! rap! went the knocker. \" Watch ! watch ! \" shouted a voice from the window. \" We wUl ride further on, Tom,\" he said, \" I fancy.\" \" On accoent of the gate, Captain ?\" \" Yea, Tom.\" \" Well, Captain, what do you say, now, to set ting up in a new line altogether ; or suppose I do it, Captain ?\" \" What do you mean, Tom?\" \" Why, just this. I should like to keep that gate for to-night I think, and then it would be so handy for you.\" Felix Heron saw what Tom meant, and he saw likewise what immense advantage it wccld be to him to have a confederate at tbe turnpike-gate instead of an enemy. \"Shall I do it, Captain?\" \" Stop a bit.\" Felix Heron wanted to see what sort of person was keeping the gate, and whether it was in tbe possession of more than one. Telling Tom Ripon to keep close to the end cf the lane, in tbe deep shadow of the trees, Heron himself tro ted on towards the gate. As he approached it, he heard a deep-toned voice, singing in such a low mnmbUng tone that it sounded like distant thunder. \" Get in, stupid !\" aaid Tom, as be flung a good siz d pebble up at the window. Smash went a pane of glass. \" Come away \u2014 come away 1\" called out Captain Heron. Tom released the bridle of his horse, and in stantly mounting, he was by the side of Heron. The eprieging of various rattles in tbe distance announced that the watch were taking the alarm ; but Daisy and Tom's horse trotted off together down Whitehall, perfectly careless of the growing tumult they left behind them. \" Oaptain,\" aaid Tom, \" where shall we go just to let the folks have a good taste of oar quality ?\" \" Yon will be so good Tom,\" t aid Heron, \" as to ride some fifty paces behind me, fer I want to con sider a little, and will call to you when I want you.\" Tom Ripon let H\u00bbron and Daisy trot on a little, and fell back to tbe distance required. Heron took hit way over Westminster Bridge, and then made for the Kew-road. The old red brick palace at Kew was then in the regular occupation of the royal family ; and on the road from it to London, it was quite a rare thing not to find some of the royal carriages con veying members of tbe Conrt. They were the soit of prey that Captain Heron intended to have. Increasing, then, the pace of Daisy, the half-way honae to Kew was soon reached. From that hostel to the village of Kew itself the road at that time was very lonely and thinly dotted with houses. \" HUloa ! hilloa ! Gate ! gate !\" shouted Heron, as he paused at the closed turnpike. \" Here you are \u2014 threepence I Do you want a ticket?\" cried the pikeman, coming out of tbe little hut in which be lived. Heron started. \" Why, Blueskin !\" he cried; \" is that yon ?\" \" Oh, Lor' I\" \" Why, what's the matter?\" The man who came out, on the demand for the gate to be opened, was no other tban the redoubt able Blueskin, and tbe well-known bull-dog and janitor of Jonathan Wild's honae in Newgate Street, and then the friend and foUower of FeUx Heron. The moment hia name waa mentioned by Cap tain Heron, Blueskin retreated into the hut and closed the door. So formidable, indeed, in the preoeding reign, had the attacks of the knights of the road been on that small extent of way, tbat for a long time, a military patrol had traversed it from the hour of eleven at night to the daybreak of the next morn ing. But that precaution had of late been dis continued. Felix Heron thna conaidered that for a time at all events, he had the road to himself. There was one spot in particular tbat was pecu liarly adapted for tuch ad ventures at those Bought by bim and Tom. It waa a epot at which the road narrowed pre paratory to reaching a turnpike gate. On each side waa a shady lane, tbat went across the highway. WeU might Heron aek him what was tbe mat ter. \" Jog on !\" cried Blueskin. \" Stop a bit, though ; I muat know who you are.\" \" Surely you know me ! i am Feb'x Heron.\" \"What! The Captain!\" Blueskin ran ont of the hut, and held np a lan tern to Heron's face. - \"Why, ao you are, to be sure! Why, what you *o thia part of the world. Captain ?\" \" What brings you, Blueskin? I cannot help saying that I took it a little ill of you that you left me at the Foreat without a word.\" \" Don't speak of that,\" replied Blueskin. \" I conldn't abide the trees and the grata, and I couldn't sleep, the place was so precious quiet al,"], [60, "54 zorrn HERON. sight long It was a\u2014 what do you call ft? \u2014 a rural tort o' life ; and that never did b * tee with my constitution.\" Heron laughed. \" But what are yon doinar here, BI aeskin ? Can it be possible tbat keeping a turnpike is the sort of life you like, and that in tbe country, too ?\" \" Lor' bless you, no, Oaptain ; it's only for this one night\" \" Then you have taken posaesiion merely on business ?\" Bnt Blueskin did not want to give Heron a chance of reprisals. He saw that he had missed him, so off he set at as hard a pace on foot as he oeuld. Bat fae bad to pan Tom Bipon. Heron called out aloud. \" Fire, Tom\u2014 fire! Tom comprehended what waa meant pretty well, and he leveUed one of hit pistols at Blue.kin, as well as he could in the darkness, and fired. Blueskin fell. \" That's it, Oaptain.\" \" And where is the real pfkeman ?\" \"In a bag I\" \"In a bag?\" \" Yes, Captain ; I brought a flour sack with me, and I put him in, and tied him np corns irtable, and he is in the Uttle bit of a crib up sg'in tbe wallas happy as a king. HUloa! Lock out! Htre's something a-coming.\" Blueskin ran into tbe but, and in another moment came back with a crape mask on h's face, and a broad-brimmed slouched bat on bis head. \" Hit I\" cried Tom. Blneskin fairly rolled over on tbe road, and then scrambling to bis feet, he ran off again, as if not muoh, if anything, was tbe matter. FeUx Heron spoke to the lady in the coach. \" I have rid yon of your troublesome assailant,\" be said. \"Is there any ether service I can render to you?\" \"Oh, yes, air'; will you help the poatilion ?\" S\" All right, your Royal Highness,\" said the pos tilion. \" I am not hurt, though the rascal did give me a heavy falL \" By these words, Heron found that the lady was of exalted rank. A carriage was rapidly approaohing tbe gate from Kew. The lights flashed on the tall hedgerow on each tide, and the postilion who drove the carriage cracked hit whip loudly, is a signal to the pike keeper to open the gate. But Blueskin had no intention of doing any thing of the tort He ran over to the other side of the way, and at toon at the carriage stopped at the closed gate, he was at the window of it and shouted, \" Your money or your life !\" A soream, in the voice of a lady, testified to the fact that, whatever ocoupauts it had, one of them at least wat of the feminine gender. \"Be quick about it, ma'am, will you?\" roared Blueskin! \" Help ! oh, help I\" The poaiilion, with more courage than pru dence, made a blow at Blueskin with tbe butt-end of hia whip. \" Get out I\" cried Bluest in, as he took hold of the postilion, and at onoe flung him \\f t_e borae on to the road. Oaptain Heron moved to tbe side of the car riage, and glanced into it One lady only was there. She had dropped to her knees in the carriage in a state of fright It was contrary to all the rules and principles that Heron had laid down for himself, to rob a lady alone, and he did not feel disposed to allow Blueskin to do so. \"Madam,\" he said, \"you shall not want a proteotor while I oan be of service to yon.\" \" Oh, sir, a tbontand thanks !\" \" Now, ma'am 1\" cried Blueskin again after he had disposed of the postilion. \" Ruffian I\" cried Felix Heron. \" This lady is under my protection!\" \"What!\" \" Be off, lest worse come to you.\" Blutkiu was thunderstrioken. He could never have calculated upon any hindrance from Felix Heron, and yet there he was, ordering him off. \" Ob, come, none of tbat.\" \" Be off !\" Bang ! went Blneakin's pistol right over tbe kneeling lady, in the coaob, at Oaptain Heron. The ball, with a whieding rush, went past the face of Heron, whocaUed out, \"That shot shall cost you dear.\" CHAPTER OXOV. HERON PATS A VISIT TO THE BED BRICK PALACE AT KEW, AND MAKES A GOOD BOOTT. The lady trembled very much, and the could hardly apeak from the state of agitation she waa in. She seemed to be equaUy reluctant to accept or to res uae the proffered aervice of Felix Heron. There was an awkward silence for a few mo ments' duration, which Heron did not like to break, for fear he shonld be urging her to what was ini mical to her feelings in t bit matter. Bnt at length she tpoke. \" I am anxious now to go back to Kew.\" \" I am at your service, madam, in any direc tion I\" \" But yet, unless I know who the gentleman is who so kindly proffers his help, I thaU hardly feel that I ought to accept it\" \" Madam,\" repUed Heron, \" I think if I were shipwrecked, I should not stop to assure myself of the maker's name of a boat that offered its friendly shelter to me ; but, if yon wish it, I wiU repeat that my name ia Baron Yon Peck.\" \"Von Peck ? I don't think I know the name.\" Heron slightly inclined his bead, as though he would have indicated that it was probable enongh she did not know it \" Nevertheless,\" added tbe lady, with quite a generons air, \" if yon will be so good as to ride by the carriage on its road back to Kew, I shall feel infinitely obliged.\" \"It shall be done!\" Heron rode a few paces from the widow of the carriage, and then he blew tbe silver whistle which he well knew Tom Ripon would recognise as a call to him. Tom was close to him in a minute. \" Follow !\" said Heron. \" Yes, Oaptain.\" The postilion had now turned bit horses' heads in the direction of the village of Kew again, and let off at a good round trot Felix Heron rode, like an equerry, at the aide of the oariiage, but he did not feel exactly well pleased"], [61, "EDITH HERON. 55 at the manner in which the great lady had re ceived or appreciated bis services. On that feeling, he did not have any great incli nation to say anything further to her. The little drive to Kew thus passed off rather quietly, and it was not until the gates were opened that led directly to the palace that the lady, look ing from the window of the carriage, epoke one name. That voice which was in itself a charm, and which was the delight of all those who loved him. The lady sighed. But she could not well get rid of the man who had performed for her so signal a service merely because he was not young and handsome. With more ease and self-possession than she had before exhibited, since now she was at home and had nothing to fear, she bowed to Heron, and spoke. \"Baron, his Majesty wiU, I am sure, himself thank you for your giUantry this evening to his lister.\" \"Baron?\" \" Yes, madam.\" \" I am not ub grateful for tbe service you have rendered me, and I hops tbat you wiU rest awhile at tbe palace.\" What exactly this invitation implied. Heron was rather at a loss to gness, but his love of adventure prevailed over every other consideration, and he re plied cautiously, \" I will not deny that myself and my servant are both in need of rest, and I gra.efully accept your offer.\" \" You have, then, a servant with yon ?\" \"I have, madam\" \" I did not lee him.\" \" Then I have the honour of speaking to tbe Princess Mary Sophia of Mecklenburgh ?\" \" Yes,\" replied the Princess, with a sigh ; for it was well known that her union with tbe Duke of Mecklenbnrgn was anything but a happy one. By this time they had reached the head of a short flight of stairs, and a gentleman usher threw open a door and bowed low. The door opened into a pretty reception-room. When about half-way through it, the Princess spoke again. \"Baron, be seated, and no doubt his Ma jetty will thank you.\" \" One moment, Princess!\" \"Baron!\" \" He is but a lad, madam, bnt he is faithful and brave.\" The carriage, while the very short conversation took place between FeUx Heron and the lady, was proceeding at a very alow pace towards the principal wing of tbe palace. There was a flashing of torohes and some com motion as the carriage made its appearance, aud Heron aaw that there could be no doubt about the rank of the lady, by the guard presenting arms to her. \" I am not what I seem.\" \"Sir?\" Heron spoke in bis low, sweet tones, as he added, \" I feel that to deceive you I should need to be formed of very different materials to tnose which make np my mental condition ; and as we may never meet again, let me say that I am not a baron.\" He began to cast about in his mind ti think which member of the royal family the was ; and at length he decided that she must be the Princess Mary Sophia of Mecklenbnrgb, the sister of the King. \" Tom,\" whispered Heron. \" Yes, Oaptain.\" \" Take good care of Daisy.\" \" I beUeve you, I wUl.\" \" Get ber and yonr own horse under oover, but keep aa close ae you can to this part of tbe palace, and don't let any gate or stable-yard di closed npon you\" \" I won't, Captain.\" \" You can easily say, as an exonse, that the Baron is expected to leave for London at any mo ment\" \"Not even that?\" The title of baron, common as it waa on tbe Continent, had not given the Princess any very exalted ideas of Heron; but now to be told, as she found she was, tbat he had no pretensions even to that distinction, suoh as it was, proved quite a shock to her. Heron smiled. \" I do not mean to say, madam, that no title belongs to tbe humblest of your servants.\" \" Ah ! I aee.\" \" Bet tbe title is not that of baron !\" \" I am delighted to bear it You are reaUy, then, a no alemau ?\" \" I am.\" Heron had dismounted aa he epoke to Tom, and then, with that high bred \"air of courtly grace which was so characteristic of him, he stepped for ward and h\u00abnded the lady from the carri-ge. It was quite impossible for her to say no to tbe act, and she walked by the sice of Captain Heron into the ball and vestibule of that old building which had been the lodging of so many of tho Hanoverian family. A bl\u00abz- of light was in that hall, and for the first time the lady got a fair good look in the face of Oaptain Heron. She wat disappointed. Tbe disguise, that had not been sufficient to b fH \u25a0 the keen aud most practised eyes of Blue skin. waa to ber perfect All she thought ihe saw was a man past tbe midd e of life, with a dull, tawny complexion and iron-grey moustaohe. The Princess smiled as she made towards a door at the farther end of the spaitment \" I shall leave his Majesty, my brother, the far ther nnraveUing of the riddle of who you are, sir.\" Another moment, and she waa gone. Heron bad done all he intended jistthen, which was to awaken an interest, combined with a cariosity that wonld make him welcome him to her presence again. Bat what did he intend to do no v that he had obtained a goad hold, ao to speak, ia that abode of royalty ? We shall soon see. Another door opened. Heron started, and was almost guilty of a bow, for he thought it wat the King who came in. It was only Lord Clackington. \" Hit M\u00bbjesty detires me to say, sir, that on tbe representations of the Punce-s, his royal sister, that you have been of service to her, he is muck obliged.\" This was quite a polite dismissal.

The King sat down. Felix Heron itood a few paces from him, as be spoke. \" Is your Majesty qisite aure we are out of ear shot of all person** ?\" \"Quite! quite!\" \" Then, your Majesty, Felix Heron, tbe notori ous highwayman, was on the road to Kew this night.\" \" No ?\" \"I only teU your Majesty what I taiv, and what I know.\" \" But \" \" Hush !\" \" What ia it ?\" \" I hear something.\" \"What? what?\" \"A soitoi fumbling, or scratching, as if at a door.\" \"Which door?\" \"I Baw him.\" \" That one \u2014 no, it is that one \u2014 no, now it ia that one. Why, it is at all the three doors opening from this apartment in succession!\" The King had started to his feet. That he was intent upon effeoting an escape from the room was quite evident ; but the state ment of Heron, that a mysterious noise was at all tbe doors, kept him from any nearer approach to either of them. \" But we had authentic intelligence that he was dead.\" \" That it is that makes the fact of hia appear ance so strange and inexplicable.\" \" But how was it ?\" \" The carriage lamps \u2014 that carriage in whioh \"as her Riyal Highness, your Majesty's sister \u2014 shone far into the gloom of a shadowy lane, whioh crosses tbe highway near a turnpike.\" \"We know it! we know it 1\" said the King im patiently. \" What does it mean ?\" he cried. \" Sir, Baron, or whatever you may be, we shall be obliged by your making an instant examination !\" \" Outside one of the doors?\" \" Coming np that lane, then, I saw a man on horsebaik ; but what atttracted my attention was that they both teemed to move onward without any action of the horse's feet; and what was more \" \" Yes\u2014 yea !\" Heron wanted a good excuse for that exact act, and ho hastened to obey the King.

Court to be certain that no one would intrude unbidden. \" Murder !\" \"Peace!\" \"Murder! help!\" \" Another such cry, and you are a dead man _* Heron shook him to within an inch of his life. But there was one thing that Heron had quite forgotten. That was Lord Clackington. Fe had left the royal presence, but he had only gone as far as the other side of the door, and he had heard all. At some short distance from the land'.ng-place on the outside of that door there was a flight of steps, that had, at the foot of them, one of those velvet, covered doors so profusely dotted over St Jamos's Palace, to keep the numerous draughts of cold air in subjection. Down the steps Heron flang the prying Lord Clackington, and when be reachel the foot of them, his weight dashed ope-n the door that was there, and he disappeared down a much longer flight of stairs. The velvet-covered door closed with a spring. Felix Heron was now fairly rid cf Lord Clackington, and he was within the Pa_i.ce, with the King much at his mercy, The rapid movement of F.dix Heron (_om the reom prevented Lord Clackington from getting ont of the way, and Heron very nearly tumbled over him. Heron felt the immediate necessity of getting rid of Bucb an obstruction as quietly as possible. \" Idiot '\" he oried ; \" what do yon here?\" The hearty kick that Heron dealt him made Lord Clackington utter a yeU.

Then he made np his mind to play bis own ghost Avery few minutes suffiied to effect a re markable alteration in tbe exterior of Felix Heron. CHAPTER CXCVI. CAPTAIN HERON POSSESSES HIMSKLF OT SOME ROYAL GEMS, AND THE RARON VC'H PECK IS IS GOOD FAVOUR WITH MAJES1Y. The coat he wore he had had made to hia own especial order. The King foUowed the direction of the eyaa and the printed finger of the supposed apparition ; and then, in a deep toned voice, Heron said, \" Open ! open ! open !\" Tbe King began to comprehend. \" Open \u2014 the \u2014 a \u2014 the \u2014 cabinet ?\" \" Open ! open I\" Heron put on a 6t_rn look. \"Yes, if you wish; but \"\" \" Peace, oh. King ! It is mt pe-mitted to mortal eyes to see the manner in whie'i spirit mingles witb the elements, and diss.pp-ars from mortal gaze. In that cabinet I \u00ab\u00bba Ta,zo my leave.\" \u25a0 In\u2014 the\u2014 a cabinet, I\" On one aide it suited well the pretensions and appearance of the Baron Von Peck, bat on the other it was a light soarlet edged with gold lace. It was so made too on that other side that it could be buttoned much more tightly over the slim and graceful figure of Heron. When he had, therefore, effected this change, he looked not about half the size of the Baron. The wig was the next thing dispensed with. Then a good hard rub of a handkerchief noon hit face enabled Heron to get rid of tbe greater part of the false colour he bad put on to personate a man much older than himself. A twittof the hat that the supposed Baron Von Peck had worn changed itsaiooct moat completely. And all thia change he effected so rapidly that to the King, who was in that sta'e of nervous terror that could take no good cognisance of him, it seemed as if tbe Baron Von Peck had only just passed through the doorway of the room. And then tbat door, slowly and in a solemn kind of way, was opened. The King glanced at it with protruding eyes and bated breath. \"In it. Open! open!\" Heron bad heard thai the King bad a large ca binet, of w nich he himself always kept the key, and wherein it was believed he Kept a goodly share of gold and jewels. Upon the speculation that this might be that very cabinet, Heron made the dead set at it that he did. The King famVed in his pickets. He produced a key. The impression of Heron that the caSinet or escritoire Wa*3 the very one of which r* e had hoard eppreached to a certainty. \"But \u2014 but,\" said the King, ebaking as he spoke, \u2014 \" if \u2014 if yon go there, I shall be afraid to open the door opain.\" \"I will knoeE there when I have passed away.\" Tbe door oreaked. It wag a good half-miauto b:fere it was wholly opened. Then she King felt inclined to cry out, but his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth. He was completely, for the time, paralyzed with terror. Heron, in that full and complete costume of a highwayman, stood on the very threshold of tha door. Slowly, then, and acaording to the most ap proved supposed fashion of ghosts, he glided into tbe room Be uttered a hollow groan. Tbe King gasped. He tlid off his chair. The King opened the cabinet It was capacious enough on the icside for Heron to walk into it v\u00abry w=il, only slightly stooping. He pulled the door shut after him. \u00a3<_____ tie utterej a strange, unear hly cry from the inside. It only wanted snmetbintr of that sort to in crea o the terror of the Kinp to \u00abnch a height that be cou'd no longer remain without some human companionship. H'ith a shout of despair and fright, he fled from the r^om. He dropped to his knees. Heron spoke. \"0 King! 0 King! \u2014 yon, who while tbe breath of life animated the mortal frame of Felix, Earl of Whitcombe, list\u2014 oh, list I\" \"I\u2014 I\u2014 will.\" That was exactly what Felix Hercn wanted him to do. The King could only Bpsak in choking accents. \"Contrive not, dream not aught tbat can in any shape or way bring the shadow of unnappi nesi to ihe hearth of the widowed Countess of Whicombe or her infant eon.\" He stepped ont of the cabinet at once, and taking a wax candle from the candelabrum on the tab'e that wa9 _e '.rest to him, he commenced an exami nation of the cabinet The inside was peculiar. There were two tall nests of drawers, and be tween them an open space, in which Felix Heron had stood. \" We \u2014 we wiU not.\" \"It is well.\" Heron stood in the middle of the apartment, and pointed to an escritoire that wat there significantly. \" The time has come,\" he said, \" when this im mortal spirit must return to those realms from whioh, for a brief spaoe, it has been allowed to visit the earth.\" Feeling, then, that he might not have many moments to spare, Heron proceeded at once to attack the drawers. They were not locked. The sight that met bis eyes most abundantly aatisfied him. \u2022 \" Y-e-s.\" The King seemed quite delighted to bear that the ghost of Oaptain Heron waa about bo politely to take itt departure. But Heron still pointed to the escritoire, and the King could not understand what the ghost exacUy mwaat In the first drawer that he opened he saw a quanity of unset jewels whioh looked to be of great v_lue. Heron took possession of some eight or ten. \" Thus much,\" he said, \"in earnest of compen sation for the losa of the rents of the Whitoombs estates.\""], [65, "EDITH HERON. 59 He closed the drawer again en the instant, and darted ont of tbe room bv tbe tame door through which he had previously cone, on the occasion of his encounter with Lord Clackington. Tbat wat not, however, the door at which tbe King bad made hit hurried and frightened exit Heron ran down the short flight of steps, where he had precipitated Lord Clackington ao short a time before. 4 1 seel chilled to the marrow of my bones, on account of the promise I have m .do I\" \" Promiae 1 Wnat promise ?\" \" The spectre oame ont of that cabinet !\" \"Ah!\" \" ird it spoke to me in a hollow, awful Voice !\" \"What? what?\" \" ' If,' ft laid, ' you would save the King from further visitation from me, you must yourself con tent to tee me each month whenever the moon is in the tame position as now 1\" At the foot of theie, he pushed open the velvet covered door. No Lord Clackington was to be seen, however, and co dim was the light that oame from aeorrid >r below, to that part of the Palace, that Heron was very nearly falling down the nexi, and longer slight of steps himself. Then he paused, and asked himself what he had better do. \" And \u2014 and \u2014 you ' \" Consented 1\" \"On, Baron!\" \" I feel that I could not possibly do less than encounter even the terrors of the unsubstantial world in your Majesty's service 1\" \" Escape \" wat the word that oame uppermost to his lips. In all likelihood he would be able to make good his r jit from the Palace by that route. Heron began to descend the 6t -.in. He paused. The flash of more light came from below. The clash of arms. The King looked gra-iione. \" May I humbly represent,\" said Lord Clack ington, \" that something much more substantial than a ghoat met me, and flung me from top to bottom of a flight of steps ! I have not a square inch of me that is not a bruise I\" \" Where was that, my lord ?\" asked Felix Heron. The murmur of voices. \" Exactly outside that door ?\" Heron shook his head. \" Impossible, my lord I\" \" Bnt, I tell you, it waq ao ; and, if I am not mad, it was yon who \" \" Hold 1\" \" This way \u2014 thit way \u2014 Yeomen of the Guard 1\" cried a voice. \" Dp thete ttairs \u2014 I wul follow you!\" The voice was Lord Olaoking ton's. Heron hesitated. Shonld he make a rush, and trnst to hit ad dress and oarriage, to force a way through the body of the Yeomen of the Guard, who were in the vestibule below ? \"And why bold, sir?\" \" I will prove to you that it was not so!\" \"How? how?\" \" Because you were somewhere else !\" \" I was not ! 1 was \" \"No* outside that door, Burely, when the King was holding a private conference, my lord! That ia impossible 1\" \" I\u2014 I \" No. With all hit contempt of danger, Felix Heron felt that that would be too hazardous an attempt There wat no resource but to retrace hia steps. And why not return to the room in whioh, as Baron Von Peck, he had had an interview with the King ? The work of a few moments wonld suffioe to make him look like the Baron again, \" Exactly ! No one oould have been there at the time 1 left this room, considering that you, my lord, had left it ten good minutes before, unless with the one object of listening I\" \" I li.ten !\" To be sure, he had rnbbed off his face some of that skilfully arranged paint and colour that had given age to it, bnt he could pull hit wig low down, and that might not be noticed. The King was not exactly in a state of mind to notice nice distinctions \" Certainly not, my lord ; and, therefore, you were not there I\" Lord Claokington shrank back. A quiet smile passed over the face of the King. Lord Clackington had the fate of all sycophants and parasites, tie was heartily despised, aud bnt that he was of nse in his vocation, the King would have heard, without the least emotion, that be had broken his ne.k. The idea no sooner found a borne in the mind of Heron than it was carried ont He changed the coat again, and in a few se conds be wat in the apartment as the Baron Von Peck, look ng much at he had before looked. \" Save the King!\" oried Lord Clacking on as he followed the Yeomen of the Guard into the room. From that moment, Lord Clackington hated the Baron Von Peck. Tbe King sat down, with a ligh. \" My Lord Clackington I\" \" Your Majetty !\" \" It teemt to me that it is singularly remiss in the first gentleman of our household to be at tacked by apparitions.\" \" But, your Majeoty \" \" We have no further need of your services to night, my lord.\" Lord Clackington bowed \"And to-morrow,\" added the King, with a wave of his hand, while he half closed his eyes, a< if tbe tight of Lord Clackington was painful to him, \u2014 \"and to-morrow we hope aud expect a fuller aid Better eip'anation of your conduct\" \" Your gracious Majetty, I \" \" No ! Know, my lord, we will hear no more- \" Treason ! treason !\" shouted another voice, and another of tbe doors opened, disclosing another party of the Yeomen of tbe Gnard, in whose midst was the King himself, with a drawn sword in his hand. The Baron von Peck stood between these two forms. Tbey all came to a standstill. \" Baron !\" oried the King. \"Your Majesty'\" \" The\u2014 the ghost!\" Felix Heron got up a well-acted shudder. \" I saw it, yonr Majetty ! In vaiu I tried to interpose, but it teemed to pass me like a cloud of vapour I\" \" Gracious heaven !\""], [66, "60 EDITH HERON. o-night Bsron, yon will oblige us by stay ing\" Heron bowed. The discomfited Lord Clackington retired with the Yeomen of the Guard. \" Baron,\" said the King, \"I would fain ask you to what noble family you belong?\" \" The Von Pecke of Darmstadt, your Majesty.\" \" Oh, well, we never heard of them, bat it is evident yon are a brave man. Baron.\" \" { hope so, your Majesty!\" \" And you have tbe manners and the appear ance of a gentleman, likewise.\" Heron bowed. death. It is more than strange; but now good night, and do not forget that you are in the ser vice of the King I\" Felix Heron could not help feeling in some degree surprised at this tudden confidence of the King in him; but, upon reflection, he could not contider that it wat a very flattering distinction. Had the service which the King wanted been of an honourable detcription, he would not have turned to a ttranger to render it to him. Heron pauied at the door of the apartment, and then be bethought himself that it wonld be weU to make the moit of tbe present opportunity. He tapped at the door again, and re-entered the room. \" Baron, it eo happens that we, at thia present time, require the services of a bold and devoted gentleman.\" Heron bowed again. \" There is a lady Well, Baron \u2014 ha, ha ! \u2014 youare a man of the world, aad therefore I need not excuse myself to you a lady, who, to our eyeB, contains many charms in her own peraon We wish aome devoted friend of oura to be to good at to take upon himself to be upon such friendly terms with her, that \u2014 that In fact, we want the help of a man of courage and address.\" Heron bit his lips. Was it poaaible that he could sink so low as to be employed on such a matter ? Be he dissembled. \" Your Majesty makes a half-confidence,\" he eaid. \" You want to know more ?\" \" All\u2014 if I am to be of any service to the lady,\" Heron added to himself. \" Your Majesty forgets that I am a stranger here in the palace. I may even be questioned as I leave it.\" \" That ia true,\" replied the King. \" Wait one msment\" Felix Heron wat left alone for about a couple of minutes, and then the King returned to him and banded him a small strip of parchment, on which was a freshly impressed seal in red wax. The word \" Pass \" was written on the parch ment just above the aeal. \" This wiU clear a way for you, Baron, in the oalace whenever you please. It will be recognised by my servant! as the pass I give to those who are in my private and confidential service.\" Herou could not but feel the full importance of such a document, and be eagerly possessed himseU of it \" I thank your Majesty, and will take care to make good use of this.\" \" Good night, Baron.\" \" I have the honour again to wish yonr Majesty good night.\" In five minutes more Felix Heron was free of \" You are right.\" \" I hope so, your Majesty.\" \"The lady is young, and an orphan. It is in our hands to appoint a guardian to her, and if that guardian is a friend of ours, we thonld feel that we were on the road to success.\" <he palace. Tom Kipon had been in a great state of alarm, but the sight of hit Captain, safe and sound, soon restored hia spirits. A short, sharp gallop took them to London, and Felix Heron drew a long breath of relief as he crossed once more the threshold of Whitcombe \"Success?\" \" Yes; we love the lady, Baron.\" \" And she is so young as to need a guardian ?\" \" She is of the poetioal age of seventeen.\" \"Indeed!\" \"Even ao, Baron. In a woTd, will you accept the office of guardian to the young lady, and occupy a auite of apartments at Hampton Court?\" \" Yeur Majesty, I really \" \"Stop, Baron; I ought to ask if you are a married man ?\" dome. \" Felix\u2014 Felix !\" It wat Edith's voice. She was sitting np waiting bis retort, and she was pale and anxious. \" Edith, this must not be!\" \" Yea.\" Heron lookod in her face with ac air of gentle \" Oh, that'e a pity.\" \"Indeed, aire?\" \"Yea; your wife will be an obatruction. Women are such dragons ol virtue in regard to any one but theaiBc.lves.\" \" My wife is not with me, sire.\" \"Ah I At Darmttadt ?\" reproach. \" Nay, think nothing of it,\" replied Editb. \" Since you are returned, all it well again I\" Felix Heron then related to Edith the fall par ticulars of bia nigbt't adventure, and it was deter mined that he should still keep np his delusive connexion with the King, and seem to coincide with him in his views for the sole purpose of thwarting them, and Raving the young lady who had excited the royal admiration from the other wise wretched fate that awaited her. Heron inclined hit head. \" That will do\u2014 that will do ! Come, Baron ; I see we shall be able to arrange this matter satis factorily. You will call on us to-morrow at the general audience at one o'clock.\" Heron understood this to be his conge, and bowed low. Heron was breakfasting with Edith in the little dressing-room connected with the tuite of rooms on the tecond floor, which she, Edith, called her own, when Ogle tapped at the door and put on a look of puzzled half-alarm when he was toid to come in \" And aa regards this apparition of the late Earl of Whitcombe,\" added the King, with a shudder, \" you take that on yourself.\" \" It it as I have had the honour of reporting to your Majetty.\" \" What it amisa, Ogle ?\" said Heron. \"I hardly know, Captain, whether to say it it anything amiss or not; but Jonathan Wild ii clow.\" \" Jonathan Wild ?\" \" The whole affair bewUders me, Baron; and I know not what to think.

He is dead, and he owes me money !\" Editb was abont to ask what could that possibly concern ber, but she thought it better, ab Felix Heron was listening, to let Jonathan WUd say a'l he chose. Heron was tUent for a few moments, and then he took Edith's hand, as he said, \"My Editb, have you any great objection to Bee this man, and ascertain what his errand is here ?\" \" Yes. he owes me money, and the only surety I have for it is on a small estate which belonged to him, and which was apart from the rest of tbe properties of the earldom. Now, if I take pos session of that estate, will you abstain from setting up any claim to it on behalf of yonr son, the pro sent Lord Warringdale ?\" It sounded so strange to Edith to hear any one speak of her little child as Lord Warringdale, and yet that was the title of courtesy which was his, as being the eldest son of the Earl of Whitcombe The question, however, whioh Jonathan Wild aaked was one that ebe knew not how to reply to. Without some consultation with Heron she neither liked lo say yes or no. \"None, Felix\u2014 none! It is tbe best thing to do, I am sure !\" \" Then thow him, Ogle, into the green drawing room. I will occupy a place in the adjoining one, and Edith will come to him \" It was not withont a little shrinking and trembling that Editb made her way down stairs for the purpose of meeting the man who it ap peared must either be killed or conciliated. Felix Heron took up a position in the adjoining room, where he could conveniently overhear aU that passed. Jonathan WUd was in the middle of the floor, with his back to tbe window of the green draw ing-room when Edith entered. \" Sarvent, madam,\" said WUd, with an awkward attempt at a bow. Edith looked calm and rigid. She did not speak. \" I don't wonder,\" added Wild, \" tbat your ladyship is rather surprised to see me : but the fact is, I want to set yonr mind at ease abont me.\" Edith was still silent \"Give me nntil this time to-morrow,\" she said, \"and you shall have yonr answer.\" Wild bit hia lipa. \" Hark yon, my lady,\" he said ; \" there are other persons still alive in whom you feel an interest. Say yes to my request, and I will not meddle with any of those who have been the comrades of Felix Heron.\" Edith hesitated. \" I will name them to yon,\" aaid Wild. He counted them off npon his fingers. \" Ogle, Tom Bipon, his mother, and Mortifica tion, his father-in-law. I will hang them all next seaaions. Let me see. Yee, I wiU get np a good plate robbery, and hang them aU next aeasions it yon refuse me.\" Edith was thoroughly alarmed. \"So long, then,\" she said, \"as you abstain from intei ference with the persons yon have named, there will be no disposition on my part to interfere with you or whatever means yon may adopt to get your money on account of Lord War ringdale.\" \" That wUl do\" It was strange how perfect a reliance Jonathan Wild had upon the word of Edith. That men like WUd know what honour, and honesty, and virtue are, is made evident by the fact tbat they are sharp in discerning such quali ties in other persons, and are always ready to give them every weight. \" It is a bargain, Lady Whitcombe,\" he said ; \" and to now I wUl take my leave of yon, and you wUl have no more trouble from Jonathan Wild.\" These were welcome enough words to Edith ; and ehe tbought the sacrifice of tome, perhaps, doubtfully legai claim which her ton might have to the property in question, well bartered for the peace and sejurity promised by Jonathan. Wild. EJim was delighted to see him leave the room, \" You might fancy that because I thought it my duty to follow up yonr husband, the late Earl, that I might be an enemy to you and your son ; but it is not ao. I am rather a bad enemy, and it generally happena tbat those who are such can, if they please, be a good friend.\" \" I am content,\" replied Editb, \" that the ran cour with whioh you pursued the father wUl not be carried out against the son.\" \" It will not, my lady. I promised as much to the late Earl, and although there ia nothing in life tbat Jonathan WUd can be aaid to fear, yet a promise to the dead he holds sacred.\" Edith made a movement of assent \u2022\u2022 Bnt,\" added WUd, \" as there should be always two sides to a bargain, perhaps yon, in your turn, WiU have no objection to obUge Jonathan WUd ?\" CHAPTER CXOVII. FELIX HERON GOES TO A COURT BALL, AND IS INTRODUCED TO THE RING'S FAIR WARD. At these words from Jonathan WUd, Edith shrunk back and trembled.

At present let him posse.s it as the bribe for your security and peaoe.\" \" That, Felix, was in truth the light in which I viewed it\" \"And the proper one, too.\" Felix He on remained at borne at Whitcombe House for the greater part of the morning, during whioh the yonng Earl of Bridgewater called, and they had a long conversation in regard to what had happened bet tveen Heron and the King. \" I am at a loss,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater, \" to think who the young lidy can be to whom the King has become guardian ; but it is a most fortu nate thing for ber that he has met with yon in your aaaumed character of the Baron Von Peck.\" The change of dyras'y was as yet very fresh as a disagreeable fact in many people's minds, and in effect it took quite another generation before the exiled Stuarts, with al the special interest con nected with them, were quite forgotten. It was no part of Felix Heron's wish to mingle with the corrupt society abont him, so he retired into the deep shadow of a bay-window until his name should be called. There waa an air of sadness and chagrin about tbe E.irl, the canse of whioh Edith inquired. \" Shall I confess,\" he replied, \" that I am aorry for the death of Lord Warringdale, since I had not given np the hope of bringing him to justice for the murder of my father ?\" \" Do not.\" said Edith, \" nourish such an idea. Leave him now to the jastioe of heaven.\" \" I must fain do so.\" In about half an hour one of the royal pages shouted ont the name- \" The Baron Von Peck!\" Tho impetuous young Earl of Bridgewater conld not reconcile himself to the faot that Lord Warring dale had, so to speak, slipped through his revenge ful fis gera. But there waa no help for it He left Whitcombe Home with the promiae of railing again in tho evening to hear what had happened to Heron with the King. With greater care than he bad naed on the day previous, Felix Heron painted and disguised his features so aa to look considerably older than hia leal age. All the names of the persons who were to have, by previous arrangement, special audience of the King, were entered in a book kept by the Groom in Waiting, and as they were one by one wanted in the royal closet, the name was caUed ont by one of tbe pages in waiting. \" The Baron Von Peck!\" \" Here!\" Heron taw that he was regarded with no small amonnt of ourioaity by the throng of peraons in tbe ante-room, for the name of Von Peck was a new oue at Court He got himself np, as the theatrical phrase is, excellently ; and with the slight stoop that be assumed, he looked a man of, at the least, five-and forry years of age. At one o'clock he took his way on foot to tbe Palace of St James's. \" This way, sir.\" Heron followed the page. In another moment he was in the preienoe of the King. \"WeU, Baron!\" \" I have the honour to wait your Majesty's com mands.\" The King had slept at Kew, but had ceme to town early in the morning, for the private audi ences at the hour of one. \" You shaU hear them, and I will not donbt but that you wUl study to entitle yourseU to our royal gratitude.\" What difference there was between royal grati tude and any other, the King did not condescend to explain, but perhaps he meant that kind of gratitude which contents itself with promises only. Heron paused. \" Alone !\" said the King. The page who Ungered by one of the doo re, immediately retired, and let fall over the door a very heavy velvet curtain. The King and the supposed Baron Von Peok were alone. Those private audiences were held every other day, and all persons, in any way connected with the various households of the King, had the liberty of attending them, and communicating personally with the Sovereign. Heron presented himaelf at a door in the Colour Court, where he eaw varioua peraons going in. He was stopped instantly. \" No admittance here, air.\" \" I am the Baron Von Peck.\" The Groom in Waiting shook hia head aa he replied, \" We have no orders, Bir, abont yon ?\" \" Will this suffice ?\" \" Yon tee, Baron, I truit you implicitly, not withstanding thia is an age when we may look with suspicion npon strange faces \" \"I waa wondering,\" replied Heron, \"how it waa, when it ia well known the land is fall of plots and plotters, you oould place suoh confidence in me.\" Heron exhibited the past which the King had given him. It did suffioe. \" Pats on, sir.\" An open book was In the smaU vestibule to whioh that door in the Colour Court of St Jamei'i"], [69, "63 EDITH HERON. * I have tried you.\" \"Tried me?\" \" . fay I ask is the governess devoted to your Majesty ?\" \" She ia eighty seven, half-blind, three-quarters deaf, and generally infirm ; so it don't matter to whom she is devoted. \" Yes.

Your Majesty chow her ?\" \"Certainly not, Baron We have one faculty which it is said belongs to kings. We think we can detect who to trust and who to be on onr gnard against.\" \" We did.\" Heron could not bat see how cruelly ensnared, by the base and vUlanous intrigues which tbe King sought to fasten on her, this young girl was. He resolved that, let it cost him what effort over hia natural feelings it might, he would so far dis semble as to be the mortal saviour of tbe young girl ia question. \" May I venture to aak the name of the young lady?\" he said \" Marianna \" \"Yonr Majesty does me bnt jaitice. If no hand but mine were to be ever lifted againit you, you might live in peace.\" \" We are sure of it\" \" And I bate plots and plotters.\" \" We are snre of that, too.\" \"Then I wait your royal orders/ \"Baron!\" Tbe King paused, and Heron bant on him an expectant look. \" Baron, the young lady is \u2014 is, we may say, ob stinate.\" \" Marianna something?\" \" Let that suffice. We shall expect yoa et Bachingham House at tbe hour of aeven.\" The King inclined hie head, and Felix Heron left tbe royal presence, passing through the ante room the observed of all observers, and the envy of many who for weeks had waited there hours in attendance, without being able to procure an in terview with the King. Some one tonohed Heron on the arm. \"Indeed!\" \" Yes, Baron. We have had one interview with her, and she does not exactly \u2014 tbat is to say, ahe rather, in effect, repels \" \"Your Majeaty's adsjancea?\" \" WeU, yea.\" \" It waa to be expected.\" \" She ia very young, too ; and one wonld have thought might, from inexperience, have sonnd the attentions of a king rather flattering.\" \"And she did not?\" It was the Earl of Bridgewater. \"Follow me; bnt do not seem to know me. Yon are well watched-\" The Earl glided away among the crowd. Bat Heron managed to keep him weU in view, and slowly made his way after him. They entered a small club-room, and then they went down a short flight of steps that led down to the old deserted guard chambers, the walls of which were fancifully covered with arms and armour of all dates aid styles. There the Earl paused. \"Felix!\" \" WeU, no.\" Heron was delighted to find that the young lady, whoever she was, had repulsed the advances of the King. \" Your Majesty must have noticed,\" he said, \"in your many experiences, that there are some natures in which there is an inherent tense of virtue that nothing will tempt to transgress the bounds of medest prudence and reserve.\" \" Oh, stuff I\" \" I merely meant to say that that waa the way in which aome people wonld pat the case.\" The King corled hia lip. \" Baron, we have nothing to do with what you call tome people. If, in plain language, you are not the unscrupulous man we take you for, Bay so, ) and our confiienoe is at an end.\" Felix Heron felt very mnch inolined, at that moment, to rise from hie chair, aud throw his Majeaty of England out at the window. It was only the thonght that he might be instru- mental in saving the young girl in question from the royal clutches that lent him the power of for- bearance. \" Yea, Bridgewater!\" \" We can safely speak here, and I have an im portant question to ask of you. Do you know the name of the young lady of whom the King wanted you to take charge ?\" \"Yes. Marianna 1\" OHAPTEB CXOVIII. THE EARL OF BRIDGEWATER CONCERTS MEA SURES WITH FELIX HERON TO SAVE MA.T.I - ANNA. The moment Heron uttered the name of Mari anna, the young Earl of Bridgewater clapped his hands together, and exclaimed, \" Good heavens ! can it be possible ?\" \" What possible ?\" The girl is the orphan child of an officer who has fought and bled in the service of the ungrate ful King.\" \"You know him?\" He bad to bow, however, to conceal the flush of indignation on his face. \" Well,\" added the King, \" ia it to be a bargain, Baron ?\" \" A bargain, your Majesty.\" \" Good.

Much disturbed in mind on the whole subject, Felix Heron, in a thoughtful mood, weut home to AVhitcombe House. When Edith beard all tbat he had to tell ber, she made an instant resolve. She had no occasion to hold the King in high esteem, and she was, therefore, the more inclined to think well of any one who differed from him. The King himself was far from resenting this apparent boldness on the part of the sup posed Baron Von Peck. All he saw in it was, an admirable piece of finesse on the Baron's part, for the purpose of winning the confidence of tbe young and beauti ful Marianna. \"Felix, I will go to Hampton.\" \" You, Edith ?\" \" Yes, Felix, I will help you, too, to save that young girl from tbe danger that awaits her.\" \" But our little one ?\" \" Tbe distance is short, and I will take him. Nay, Heron, do not shake your head, and look grave at me. I cannot endure to remain here on such an occasion ; and moreover, you know, I am acquainted with old Lady Dewar, who is a friend of my dear aunt. Lady Castleneau, and who has rooms in the old Palace.\" \" Well, Baron,\" he said, \" we are not used to contradiction, but we can admire the indepen dent spirit that dictates your words.\" Heron bowed. \" Dear Edith, the only difficulty that presented itself to my mind thus vanishes. I wondered ou what pretence you were to make your way into a place so jealously cared for and guarded as Hampton Court ; but as the visitor of Lady Dewar, you are safe.\" Edith was delighted that Felix Heron had no objection to her presence at the old Palace. And when he left Whitcombe House to keep his ap pointment with the King, Edith went to Hamp ton in her own coach, with her child, the real Lord Warringdale. Tbe young girl seemed to feel instinctively that he would be a friend to ber, and a protector. Imperceptibly she crept across the room, almost to the side ot Felix Heron. \"It seems, Marianna,\" said the King, \"that you will be quite content with the Baron Von Peck.\" \" I hope so, sir.\" \" Then, Baron, I relinquish the charge of this most dear and interesting young lady to you for the present, convinced that you will do all you can for her happiness at the old palace of Hamp ton Court.\" The clock of the Horse Guards sounded the hour of seven as Felix Heron, still satisfactorily keeping up the character and appearance of the Baron Von Peck, crossed the threshold of old Buckingham House. \" I shall strive so to do, your Majesty.\" The old governess during this brief colloquy had fallen fast asleep. She had not sat down in the presence of royalty, but settling herself on her feet in some odd way, she had gone to sleep as a horse would do without lying down. The old governess was a decayed lady in waiting, and long habit of standing in the pre sence of the King or Queen, in the last reign, had enabled her to do so without trouble or fatigue. The King touched her on the arm. The old governess, with a slight start, awak ened, as fully as she would ever again do on this side of the grave. Nobody spoke to her, and she slowly followed the fair and innocent Marianna from tbe apart ment. He was shown into a small drawing-room, the same that soon after that time became well known as tbe common sitting-room of the unhappy Caroline, Princess of Wales, and wife to George tbe Fourth. In a few moments a door opened at one end of the room, and the King appeared, leading two ladies by the hands. One was a little, old, infirm woman, who fully, in looks, came up to the description that the King had given of the governess he had appointed to the young Marianna. The other was Marianna herself. Felix Heron was charmed. He was not what the world cafe a \"gaT_\u00bbnt\" man, and all bis be6t affections belonged to his Editb ; but be was not, on that account, blind to all other beauty. The King stood by the door, and as Heron passed him, he whispered, \" Baron.\" \" Your Majesty !\" \" You will not retire to rest on this night ?'\u25a0' Heron made a slight inclination of his head to signify that he fully comprehended what those words meant. In Marianna be saw such a delicate, exquisite loveliness, that he could hardly wonder at tbe King admiring her, although the dove-like man ner that eat upon her face should have kept her from any unholy thought. \" Baron Von Peck,\" said the King, \" allow me to introduce you to one of our royal orphans.\" The signification was that the King would be at Hampton Court some time before dawn. But Heron did not tremble for that beautiful Heron bowed. young girl."], [71, "65 EDITH HERON. He knew that she was safe. He add esei>d the question to Marianna. \" Your governess is rather infirm ?\" \"Yes,\" replied the young girl; \"aud I cannot imagine of what service she is to be to me. I cannot talk to her. She mistakes all I say ; and for the day and a-half that I have had ber about me, I have been her nurse, but she has not been to me a governess.

He he'd out hie hand to Marianna. \" Come,\" he aaid ; \" I am sure we shall be good friends.\" \" And I, too, am sure,\" aaid the girl, as the placed her hand confidingly in his. They left Buckingham House in this way, aud at tho gate was a carriage with four horses, aud a oouple of postilions. H.ron handed in Marianna, and then with a feeling of the most profound pity tha' tbe infirmi ties of old age in the ancient governess shonld be played upon by the King for his own ba-e pur poses he handed her into the carriage 1 kewise. Heron, as he seated himself opposite to Marianna and tbe old governess, waa curious to knoev it the ancient lady could reaUy hear a word he had to lay, or was quite deaf. \" I should think not,\" tbone ht Heron ; and then he added, \" Is she quite deaf ?\" Th\" girl langbed. \"If you bawl very loud into her ear, the can make out something of what you eay.\" \" I will try.\" Heron made a sign to the old lady that he wanted to speak to her; and eh' took a curiously shaped ear trumpet from her pocket, and placed it at her ear. \" Madam !\" bawled Heron. \"Eh?\" Edith.\u2014 No. 6L"], [72, "66 EDITH HERON. \" Madam I\" But the Bound waa too familiar a one to have much effect upon the well-drilled nerves of Felix Heron. B A madman ? Yoa don't say ao ?\" \" I am afraid she is a hop.leaa case,\" said Eeron. \"Do not be alarmed,\" he said, aa he took from his pocket a pair of pistols, and gave a hasty glance at the priming. \"Ob, what is it?\" Before Huron could make any reply the horses in th. carriage came to a standstill, and a load, harsh voice ahontid, \" Stand, at your peril I\" \" What o_n thia mean ?\" Heron asked of him self. \" Can it be possible tbat I am stopped by a highwayman ?\" \" What's the use of shooting a poor feUow like me?\" cried one of the postilions. \" Keep your cattle ttill, or I will scatter your brains on the road-side ! Now, your money, or your life ! I am a desperate man !\" The windows of the oarriage wsre np, but the \"desperate man,\" as he called himself, broke away Ihe glass ins'anily with the butt-end of a large horse- pistol, and then projected it into the coach. Marianna laughed like a happy child \" Tbat ie tho odd way in which she always an- swers me.\" Heron waa resolved to make another effort \" I \u2014 havo \u2014 not \u2014 the honour \u2014 to know \u2014 your \u2014 n*me.\" \" That's all tbe same,\" replied the old go- vern\u00b0so. \" Tnat wi'l do,\" sail Heron, in a quiet tone. \" I shall say no more.\" Ho nodded to the old lady, who, with a nod of satisfaction in return, put her ear-trumpet into her pocket sgiiu. \"Avery pleasant, conveisible sort of man,\" 6he aaid, as she did so. Heron could not help laughing in spite of him self. \" You see, Baron,\" said Marianna, \" that I am not likely to benefit much from my governesa.\" \" I think not But now, my dear girl, tell me one thing \" \" Oh, yea ! What is it ?\" \" Have yon no relations living ?\" \" Not one.\" \" Your money, or your life !\" By the light from the carriage-lamp on tbat side, Heron conld see that there was a mounted man, with a half black crape vizor on his face. \" Well, sir,\" said Heron, \" and who are yon ? ' \" Your money, watohes, and jeweUery I Quick, I aay ; for your lives, be .ye whom ye may, hang upon a thread !\" \" Stop a bit 1\" said Heron. \" Who are you, air?\" The eyes of poor Marianna filled with tears. \"I am,\" she added, \"what they term a king's orphan ; but \u2014 but I would rather be the poorest girl that ever worked for her liveUhood than \u2014 than \" \"Than what, dear?\" \" Oh, do not\u2014 do not !\" \" Do not call me dear.

The huge horae-pistol, that Heron hold by the bsrrel, ha turned so tbat, if it had been discharged, the bullet, or bnllets, would have gone through the roof of tho coach.

Marianna looked very pale bnt ahe neither swooned nor did she faint, ss many young ladies of the present day would have done. The ancient governess, thinking she heard some faint noise, put her ear-trumpet to her ear, aud assumed an attitude of listening. \"Let him go!\" said Heron, more to himself than to Marianna\" Ho is on the high road to destruction.

FELIX HERON . CONQUERS LORD WARRINGDALE, AND FROCUJIDS ON HIS JOURNEY TO HAMPTON COURT. Nothing in that way could probably have been a greater surprise to Felix Heron than the appear ance of his bad half-brother, Lord Warringdale. The statement of Jonathan Wild, on the occa sion that he had called at Whitcombe House, that Warringdale was dead, had been so explicit that Hsron had given perfect and complete credence to it \" Ob, ye_t \u2014 do not you ? Did you not see bis face?\" It waa Bomething of a shock, however, to find him there, at the door of that carriage, with his pale, wan face full of alarm, and at the tame time full of suspenae. \" Do you know me ?\" said Warringdale, with an eager look. \" I do.\" \" I did, indeed, Marianna, and I agree witn you that he is a wretched man. Postiliona, drive on !\" \" Yes, air.\" The four horses, who had had a rest, and who had just taken that sort of half-alarm that hor, es are ao subject to on anything out of the way happening, started at a good hard trot up the bill. \"Ah!\" \" And you me, or you have lost your reason.\" Felix Heron quite forgot, at the moment, what pains he had taken to disguise himself as the Baron Von Peck. Hampton Oourt waa gained in another half hour. \"TeU me, Marianna,\" aaid Heron, \"do you know this place?\" \" Not weU ; I have Been it Do you live here, sir?\" Warringdale looked at hiea anxiously, and then shook hia head. \" No I no ! I know you not ! Let me go, and take your way in peace \" \" But for one thing, I would.\" \" What is that, sir I\" \" You say you are Felix Heron, of Epping Forest\" \" I am to do ao, it seems. The King assigned me a suite of rooms in the Palac, and I suppose some one wUl be here to reoeive us, and tell us exac 1/ where to go.\" The royal carriage entered the precincts of Himpton Court by the route usually taken, where the cavalry barracks are situated, and it went on without opposition or question of any kind until it reached one of the old quadrangular court yards of the palatial edifice. Then the .postilions came to a standstUl with their hortea Warringdale was Bilent. \"How dare you assume the name of a brave man?\" \" Let me go !\" \" No, not till y u have in aa loud a voice as you made tbat lying assertion disclaimed it, and stated who you really are.\" \" Would you have m\"s destroy myself ?\" \" I insist, without farther argument, upon what I say, or I wUl lay you dead at your horse's feet.\" There wai a terrible earnestness about the manner of Heron, whioh let the terrified Lord Warringdale see that there was no esoape. In a high, cracked voice he called ou', \" I am not Felix Heron of Epping Forest, but I am \" He paused there. \" Go on,\" said Heron. \" You say you know me.\" \" I do.\" A man stepped np to the side of tbe carriage, with a lantern in his hand. \" Do I address the Baron Von Peck ?\" he asked. \" Yes, I am that person.\" \" Then, sir, if you will alight with your party, and follow me, I will conduct you te your rooms\" Felix Heron sprung from the carriage, ani as si-ted Marianna and the old deaf governess to alight, and then, with one on each arm, he loUowtd the man with the lantern. Up a broad slight of stone steps, across an ample corridor, and then through a suite of nobly proportioned rooms, their conductor lee them.un il he reached a door, in the lock of whica was an ancient gilt key. \" This is the place, sir \" he aaid. He opened the door, and disclosed a room that, from the character of ita appointments, and the profuse gilding that was upon its walls and ceiling, must have been the special abode of royalty at some timo when the old Palace was in aU its splen dour and popularity. A bright fire of logs burnt on the hearth. A couple of tall candelabra, each with half-a dozen wax lights, lit up the room, whioh, take it for all-in-all, was a very handsome sitting-room \" Who am I, then ? Do you really know that I am the highwayman called the Flying Captain?\" \" I know no such thing ; but I do know that you are to be recognised ae Lord Warringdale, the half brother of the Earl of Whitoombe.\" Warringdale groaned. \" Speak up man, or I fire.\" \"I am not Febx Heron, but I am Lord War- ringdale, his ha f-brother.\" \" Now you may go,\" said Heron. Warringdale galloped off to about a hundred feet from the co.oa. aud then he drew the second pistol from the huLtjr of hia saddle, and fired it a' the vehicle."], [74, "68 EDITH HERON. \" This, sir, is yonr room,\" said the guide ; \" anil vour bedroom is here.\" - He opened a gilt door, and disclosed a bed chamber that loosed as richly adorned aa the killing-room The old, deaf governess trotted into the room after Marianna, and the servant followed them. She gave Felix Heron what she intended should be a meaning look, aa she so closed the door. It was a look, however, to which he did not respond. Heron's object now was to find out if Edith had reached Hampton Court in safety. The evening was yet sufficiently young that he might, without exciting any particular surprise, walk abut tbe old ccurts of tbe Palace. \" Wbete is the accommodation for the two ladies ?\" asked Heron, somewhat impatiently. \" Their apartments air, are three in number and they are further on.\" \" Pray lead tbe way.\" The guide did so ; and, after crossing two large rooms and a corridor, he ushered them into a pretty suite of three rooms, wh'ch were to be idarianna's and her governess's. In one of those rooms sat a young woman reading by the light of a table-lamp. She rose at the entrance of the visitors, and curtsied profoundly. In one of them he met one of the regular staff of domestics of the place, from whom he ru -ee the inquiry for the apartments of the old lady to whom Edith was to pay a visit He foand that he was quite close to the part of the Palace he sought lor under the cloisters, where be was directed to a brass- plate on a door, with the identical lady's name npon it In five minutes more Felix Heron was with Edith, who, without any cross accident, had reached the old Palace, aud was received by Lady Castleneaa's old friend with great joy and cor diality. Edith took Heron aside for a moment. \" This is the servant who will attend to the ladies,' said the guide. As tbe light fell upon the face of the young woman, Felix Heron thought he had seldom teen an expression of countenance that be liked less- He nad a strong feeling to her prejudice on the instant. And it was well deserved. \" Felix, shall we make a confidant of my friend here?\" Experience had told Felix Heron that theie pre dilections, of the mind for or against particular people were seldom wrong. But it was evident the lureand unsophisticated mind of Marianna was well disposed to be pleased and charmed with all she saw. \" Decide for yourself, dear Edith.\" \" Then I wi\u00bbh to do so.\" \" Let it be done, then, at once. But to what extent ?\" \" All 1 Tell her aU 1\" To ber, tbe old palatial home of the great Car dinal Wolsey was a place full of romantic and interesting associations. She looked around her with the pleased expec tation of each moment seeing a something more interesting still, and Heron sighed as he saw the young, ingenuous face lighted up with gratifica tion. The old lady was quite delighted to find that the supposed Baron Von Peck was no other tbau the real Earl of Whitcombe ; but when they both came to tell her the occasion, strange aa it was, of their presence at Hampton Court, she tremhltd excessively. \"Alssl alas!\" she exclaimed. \"Another?\" \" Another what?\" asked Heron, auiioasly. ** Another tragedy I\" \"Tragedy?\" \" Yes.

Come to the window, which looks out into the court with wh*t ii called the Cardinal's Fountain in the centre.\" Heron did not think it politic to make any reply to this too familiar speech ; bat lifting one of the sockets of the wax candelabrum ih&t was nearest to him from its place aloug with i__. lighted candle, he said, * I will accompany *oo, Marianna, to the door of your room, if you please.\" \" Yes, sir.\" From the window of the old lady's utiiing room they could just dimly see ths outline of the fountain iu the court. Tbe pipes aud separates, that at one time had kept it iu action, had long since gone tc decay. The fountain no longer sent up Tte s->rvant-girl ooked rather sharply at Heron for a moment, as though she could not exactly make out wnat that was for ; but then she nodded ber bead, as much as to say, * On, yes, that, ia all right.\" She Ud the way.

The old lady put out the light in the room, and they then saw into the court-yard better, and avoided themselves the observation of any busy bodies who might be about the building. \" You see,\" abe said, \" that window up above the bust of the Roman Emperor ?\" \" Tee,\" responded Edith and Heron. \" Well, one night, at about the hour of twelve, when, from severe indisposition, I was unable to Bleep, I came to this oasement where we are no w, and my eyea fell on that window there.\" Both Heron and Edith regarded the window with a feeling of great interest that they could nut well define. They had paused at the door that we have before mentioned, and non Marianna turned to Felix Heron, and, with a charming simplicity, held out her hand to him as she spoke. \"Good night, dear friend. I shall, I think, be un with the dawn, to take a walk iu the dear, beautiful garden.\" \" Good night, Marianna,\" responded Heron, *aiid may happy dreams attend you.\""], [75, "69 EDITH HERON. I The old lady continued. \" You see that it ia quite dark now; and, though upwards of four years have expired since that night, I have never seen again a light there!\" \" The circumstance,\" said Heron, \" whatever it ia, affecta you much. Do not, it it createa dia tresa, tell it to na.\" \" Yes, Felix.\" \" That is the dear Marianna !\" Edith did look with interest, and she could guesa, from the graceful curve of the head and neck, that the description Heron had briefly given her of the young \"king's orphan\" was by no means overdrawn. \" Yes, yes ; I feel that I ought Aa I looked at it on that night, there came suddenly a light reflected from it !\" The old lady then spoke faintly. \" This ia a coincidence that is terrible to think of!\" As if the old lady'a worda had been the magic epell to conjure up the light she had mentioned, there spread at that moment over the window from within a faint light ! The old lady started. \" Good hekvens 1 What doea that mean T A light?\" \" Then what you have to relate haa reference to some such an affair as the present?\" \"It hae, indeed!\" \" There is all the more reason, then,\" aaid Edith, \" that we should know it at once.\" \" You shall \u2014 you shall. It was, as I have aaid, about the hour of midnight; and even as we all see it now, there came a light into tbat room, but it was a faint one, and only such as might be pro duced by suru9 person entering it with a lighted oandle.\" \" It ia a light !\" aaid Edith. The light slowly increased in briUiancy, until it was tolerably evident that the room to which that ca. i ruent belonged must be well illuminated from wi'hin. \" On the _\"_d, too, aa we see it now, was the shadowy n Ct-cdon of a face and head.\" \" Like tbat ?\" asked Edith. It seemed as if thia gradual lighting up of the apartment had been the result of oue candle after another being ignited, until there waa a suffi cteu'-y for any purpose Waile the process was evidently going on the old lady waa silent. Edith and Heron, too, looked on with great intereat anl curiosity. The blind of the window waa down, but still tbe lights from within ahone through it, making a dim so'tof twilight in the court beneath where the reflection fell. \" No ; it was the face and head of a man.\" \"Did you know it, as I know the shadowy like ness of that yoang girl ?\" asked Heron The old lady was silent for a few seconds, aud then she said, \" Aa I may have been mistaken, I pray that yo:. will not ask me who I thought the shadow oa the window-blind represented.\" From his experience, however, of the last four and-twenty houra, Felix Heron had no real diffi culty in guessing who the shadow oa the blind cf that room in Hampton Court Palace had ex hibited. In a few seconds the shadow of a head and face was projected on the surface of the bUnd. He felt, however, that it would be unfair to press tbe question, and he forbore from doing so. The old lady, with a deep sigh, added the fol lowing words: \u2014 \" I would tbat I had at that mo ment left this window and sought my rest \u2014 rest which it waa Liany a long night before I again knew in its unbroken serenity.\" \" There !\" cried Edith ; \" the Ught haa gone I\" \"Not wholly,\" said Heron. It had not, indeed, gone wholly, but it seemed aa if a number of the wax-lights that had illumi nated the room were auddenly put out But a faint radiance remained. CHAPTER CO.

This moat unexpected appearance of a light in tbe window of the room to which the old lady had alluded, ao overoame her that it was doubtful if ehe would be able to continue her story \" Can it be \u2014 oan it be,\" she cried, \"that the past is coming back again ?\" \"Compose yourself, I pray you,\" said Heron, \" and let us know what that past was.\" \" I will try.\" \" Yes,\" aaid Edith, \" I feel now that I would fain know that; if I do not, curiosity will keep me wakeful this night more than fear or hope.\" \"Oh, Edith, look !\" cried Heron. \"What?\u2014 what?\" \" The ahadow on the blind ! I know it well now.\" \" It was some such a light as is there now,\" added the old lady, \"that I was looking at from this window, when I heard one fearful shriek from some one in yonder room, and ia another moment the casement was dashed open, and right out, head foremost, into the court- jard below, a figure in white drapery precipitated itself 1\" \" Good heaven I\" ejaculated Edith. \"I heard the fall \u2014 the sickening crash with which the figure feU upon the stone pavement I\" \" Oh, horrible !\" \"I shall never forgot it!\" The old lady shook aa if in an ague. \" Tell ua no more,\" said Felix Heron ; \" the recollection is too much for you.\" \" Nay, 1 have told the worst.

In the complications and intricacies of the vast building, Felix Heron waa not aware until then that he had reached the court into which that chamber looked. But now he had no doubt of it The ahadowy and beautiful outUne of the fair girl waa before him on the blind. \"Look, Edith-look!\" \" And\u2014 and\u2014 the figure?\" \" When lights were brought it waa found that a dead body lay in the court ! \"Killed!"], [76, "70 EDITH HERON. \" By tbat -terrible sickening fall. It was a \u2022voucg and beautiful girl, not above sixteen years of age, in her night-diess, who lay there with her blood about her!\" \"And tho man?\" And as he got bewildered, he beoauie terribly anxiosis about Marianna. He feared that there would be no one to ask to guide him, and he waa about to try to make hia way to the court-yard with the si'ent fountain, when ho saw a moving shadow on the wall that waa nearest to him. The pres.rce of the shadow argued that of the substance n.t far off. Heron called out aloud; \"Who goes there?\" \" I, the King's servant,\" replied a voice hastily, and a man emerged from one of the old gate ways- \" What man ?\" \" The ehadow that you saw.\" \" No one was ever found. The rcom in which the young girl had slept waa carefully searched, and nothing was found that could implicate any one.\" _ \" There was surely an inquiry ?\" \" \" Tes ; but nothing came of it further than the supposition that in her sleep, or in some paroxysm if fear from some dream, the young creature hau opened the window and cast herself out\" \" Bat you \" \" I know what you would Gay \u2014 I knew that a man wae in the chamber. I did, bnt the shock of the occurrence laid me en a ted of sickness for many weeks ; and, when I reoovered, tbe whole affair was past and over, and the poor young thing rested in peace in the Uttle churchyard of the village. Heron paced the room twice. It was an action he was in the habit of doing when much moved. \" Can you direct me to the rooms of the Baron Von Peck ?\" \" You are the Baron, sir?\" \" I am.\" \" And you have lost your way, sir, among all these old courts and cloisters ?\" \" I have.\" \"That is easily done now; but. fortunately, it aa easy for me to put you right, as I know every nook and corner of the place.\" \" I shall be obliged to you.\" \" Follow me, Baron.\" Felix Heron kept tolerably close to this man, and in a very few minutes ue found himself at t__ doorway which would lead him to his rooms. \" Now,\" he said, \" I know where I am.\" \" Exactly, Baron. Hem I\" The man lingered. It was evident that he wished to say some thing, and Heron, under all the circutntt&ncos that surrounded him, was anxious to know what it waa. \" This ia, indeed,\" said Elith, \" a tenible story I\" \"So terrible a o^e,\" added Heron, \"that I will stake my Use it shall not occur again to night 1\" \" Do not take from me the shot t space of Use that remains to me,\" cried the old lady, \" by such a supposition aa ih\" possibility of such another tragedy 1\" ** No, madam ; rest in peace.

I, too, am in his corfiiience; and what I wanted to make bold to abk you, Baron, was, if you could teU me at what hour he would he here to-right?\" The sensation that cp._ie over Felix Heron at this complete confirmation of his sapposition s'at even that night wonld not be allowed to pass over without the presence of the King at Hamp ton Court, in pursuit of the destruction of Mari anna, was siokening. For a few momenta he did not reply. \"I beg your pardon, Baioa,\" added the rnun, \" if my question seems to you to bo i_.di_cree_.\" \" No, no !\" \" Then I should be glad to ksow.\" \" I cannot tell you.\" \" It will be at about twelve, then, sir.\" It was ten o'olock only. But Marianna had retired to reat, and Felix Heron felt the necessity of being in tbe rooms ,hat had been appropriated to his use, for fear the King, or some one from him, should arrive at the old Palace. \" Fear nothing, dear Edith,\" he aaid ; \" nor yon, madam. I will protect Marianna. By tbe by, did you ever discover v.ho the poor girl waa who perished ao tragicaU/ ?\" \" I forget the name; but she was what is called a 'king's orphan.'-\" It sent a cold chill' to the heart of Heron to fia^ so strong a similarity between the case of the dead viotim and Marianna. \" Perhaps.\" It wai with the greatest difficulty that Heron could keep his hand-i off this fellow.

But he could come to no ease conclusion. Hastily retracing his steps, he crossed two rooms, one of which was an ancient bed-chambfr, with one of those old, tall, four-post bedsteads of polished oak in which our ancestors delighted, and in which, notwithstanding changes of fashion have proscribed them, one thing is quite dear, whioh is, tbat tbey slept welL Heron then felt certain he had left one of those rooms by a wrong door. He wanted more in'ormation. Would the Kirg come to him? Or would he try to obtain access to the chamber of the young orphan first ? That was the question. In hie own mind, Heron decided it on the first supposition; for, otherwise, what would have been the benefit of having him as an assumed accomplice down there, at Hampton Court, at aU. He was puzzled, however, to find the only othor door fast locked. And jet be waa quite certain that that fast locked door waa the identical one through which he had pasacd with the yonng girl when she went to her own rooms. But Heron could feel certain of nothing, situate! aa he waa, and he paased an hour of feverish anxiety. Then he took one of the wax-lights, and be thought him that he wonld reconnoitre the ronte between his rooma and those in the occupation of Marianna. What did it mean ? Was that door locked on purpose ? On purpose to b _ffia him ? It looked like it Felix Heron, however, waa not exactly the man to allow a locked door to stand in his way. He bad with him a weapon which he never used either for offence or defence; it waa a dagger, with a long triangular-shaped blade of exquisite steel, and of amazing strength and tenacity. That it would answer all the purposes of a for midable crowbar Heron was well aware. Hia intention was to reach the door through which he had seen the young girl go, and there listen for awhile, to be sure that' aU waa still and serene. Treading as lightly as foct could fall, he sallied ont into the long corridor. He held the light above his head, so as to avail himself of tbe greatest portion of iUumination from it he could. It wo aid be a strong lock, izdeed, that could resist the force he waa able to bring to bear upon it with that pionard. The locka in the interior of the old Palace were large and ehowy, but not strong. And so, in that old and memory-haunted Palace of the haughty Wolsey, Felix Heron softly trod. Huah ! What ia that ? One wrench with the triangular-shaped poniard, and a portion of the gUt lock flew off. Crash went the remainder. A confused rumbling noise, as if something, or \u25a0ome one, had fallen down a staircase. Heron paused to listen. Could it be that tbat place was haunted with the spirits of those who, in old tin.es, had played so busy a part in the ancient halls and apartments of the great prelate's Palace. A strange, cold ahndder came across Felix Heron as he mentally asked himself auch a Heron paused to let the noise that he had no oessarily made subside. Then another effort opened the door, and he was able, without farther opposition, to slep lightly and quietly through to a passage to yond. question. But he'waa not superstitioua. Soon the prejudices of early life, which, for a moment, had gained an aacendancy over him, gave way before the light of reason. Heron could then have amiled at the idea of the Cat dizal, who had once caUed that royal pUe hie own, haunting it by OHAM.EB COL FELIX HERON MEETS WITH SINGULAR ADVEN- TURES AT HAMPTON COURT. Tes, he waa right now. He aaw before him the direct route to the \" The glimpses of the pale moon.\" rooma in the occupation of Marianna. He heard a clock strike eleven. Bat there could be no question about the noise he had heard. The only query was, what caused it? And as Heron stopped to listen if it should be repeated, he heard again a strange sound. Thia time it was like the clash of arma, and it gounded aa if hot further off than the foot of a dim old flight of oaken stairs, on the top of which be, Heron, stood. ' His curiosity was greatly excited, but he wonld not allow its gratification to interfere with the object of hia migration from his own rooms. That objeot was to seek the chamber door of Marianna. But an unexpected difficulty preeented itself. The appearance of the various corridors, doors, and staircases seemed to have altered since he last observed them, and Heron was compeUed to admit to himself that he had taken some wrong If the King's hoar waa twelve, he, Heron, had plenty of time yet before him for hia explorations in the ancient baUding. Fiom what that, no doubt, confidential servant, who waa in bo auspicious a manner lurking about the Palace had aaid, Heron had every reason ns snppoae that the midnight hour was the oue 1 itched upon for the arrival of t*e King. But BtiU Heron felt fnU of anxiety. He got into that most uncomfortable, nervous condition when the sense of hearing seems to be preternatnraUy acnte, and every sound, far and near, strikes with a jar upon the sensea. A very few steps now took him to the door of Marianna'e room. There he listened. No! All waa BtiU! No alarm ! Not even the slightest sound, indicative of a disturbed rest on the part of the fair sleeper. That chamber might have been the chamber of ronte. Thia waa both provoking and perplexing in the extreme."], [78, "72 EDITH HERON the dead, ao far aa regarded any sound coming from it indicative of breathing, living existence. \" R\"St in peace,\" said Heron. He turned away from the door. Aa he did so, he started back, and nearly struck heavily against its panels- The sudden sl-ish of a beam or pencil of light, such as the children produce with a looking-glass, and call \" Jack o' Dandy,\" came across his eyes. It was gone as soon aa seen. Like lightning. Ere you could say, \" Behold I\" it vanished. But Heron was quite certain such a phenomenon had presented itaelf, and waa no delusion of the imagination. What could it be ? Heron, by, as the saying is, \"putting thia and that together,\" came now to something like a rational opinion on the whole matter. There was behind the panelling cf the wall of the staircase another secret staircase, which no doubt formed, in substance, tbe end in that direc tion of the, steps that were open and visible to all eyes. The panel which had b.en shaken from tho other siue was some mode of exit on to the land ing, which the person who had ascended th& seoret flight of ataira had not found the way lo open, and so had retreated. Tbe human voice which had struck inarticu lately on his, Heron's, ears was no donbt an ex pression of disappointment on that occasion, Such was the theory, in regard to the whole transaction, that Felix Heron got up in his own. mind. And where could it be? He kept profoundly atill in the position he occupied close to Marianna _ door, and he listened with all that painful aouteneaa we have remarked upon. It waa a rational one. A very few momenta decided him as to the courte he would like to pursue. He would try the panel on the side he was on, and d'scover the secret stairs, which might he exceedingly nseful both to him and to the fair Marianna. He heard aomething. It waa like a footstep. A footstep marching with a alow, measured step, but where it waa he could not by any meana determine. Then, aa he atill liatened, and still heard it, he was tolerably sure that it approached him. The sound, however, waa muffled, as thongh some wall or door intervened between him and the full expression of it; and from the peculiarity of it now, Heron thonght that it proceeded from some one ascending the stairs. Just before him \u2014 tbat is to say, aboat twelve paces from the door of Manama',* chamber \u2014 there was a fight of steps that conducted to one of the corridors below. The panel which had been shaken was not above two feet wide, but it was upwards of twelve feet in height. Indeed, it looked so narrow, on account of its. height that Heron almost doubted if any one, of ordinary dimensions, could pass through it. That, however, waa merely a delusion of tho eyes. There was, in reality, ample space. Heron felt the panel carefully. No! Now the sound that came upon the attentive ears of Felix Heron waa exactly aa if aome one was dsceiiding thoae steps within his cb.erva tion. Not the vestige of any fastening or spring could be found- His triangular-bladed poniard wonld be wanted again. Stop ! What is this? A large window that looked clear ont into the open air in day-time shed abundance of l'ght on to that ataircaie, and even at that hour of the n'ght sufficient reflected li^ht from the night aky came in by that window to let Heron aee that, most incontestabfy, the stairs were vacant. No form could bj ascending them towards where he stood without looking more blaok and bulsy than the mere night air. And yet he heard the foot-faUa plainly enough. Nearer and nearer! A moulding rnns the whole height of the pan, -1 which is so contrived that it affords a good hold to the fingers. Heron presses laterally upon it With ease the panel glides open. It runs in a parallel fashion with the thickness of the wall, of which it seems to form a part There is no fastening. The panel whoUy depends for its aecurity on the fact of its existence being kept secret How dark ! Plainer and plainer ! Here was food for superstition. Bat Heron only kept on his guard, and strained hia eyea into the darkness. Po.sibly that very straining of the viaion might, i,i a short time, have conjured up some seeming form ou those dim stairs, had it continued muoh longer. Hut it did not How absolutely black appears the space imme diately beyond it! WeU might Heron hesitate before he adventures a step farther in that direction. And yet he feels certain there is a staircase there, and that it runs down by the aide of the open Eteps, with only the wainscot- wall between them. He makes a cantiona move. Hrron was in_lan>Iy startled from his attitude of looking and listening by tbe perceptible shaking of a panel of the wall, not three feet from where he stood. Tes, he finds something to stand npon, but it feels soft Involuntarily Felix Heron recoils. It ia bat for a moment To and fro I To and fro, with an impatient, tottering sound, Ihe panel shook! Then he thonght he heard, and he waa pretly sure he did hear it, and it waa not a mere thought, a voice mutter something on the other aide of the panel. What the voice aaid he could not gather. Gently, though, and quietly, the footsteps on the staircase began to retreat and fade away. The soft anbstance on whi :h he haa trodden is dust.

Slowly and gradually the soft light increased, and he could see into a haU of large dimen sions. He counted the atepa. There were twenty-four. Then he came to a standstill. At the foot of them waa nothing but plaio, abrupt woodwork, in the manner of a panelled wall. Tall, stained glasa windows were let into the walla at regular intervals, and npon the spaces between hnng arms and armour of all sorts and agea. It took Heron some time before he could find an opening, and then he found it all at once. Another sliding panel \u2014 only in this case i. -ink right down perpendicularly \u2014 yielded to an accidental touch- In niches, too, and ou pedestals, were the fliei-.s of men-at-arms and knights of the aay Editu \u2014No 62."], [80, "74 EDITH HERON. d'\u00e6vnl times, bearing pole-axes, or spears, aa their rank required. Then Heron knew that he waa in Wolsey'S banqueting hall, where the great Lord Cardinal feasted like a king. But, aa he looked, the light grew stronger. One of the stained-glass windows was projected in a symmetrical shadow on the floor. Heron then saw that it was to a newly-risen moon that he waa indebted for the light around him. niches and their pedestals, and moving, in slow and stately fashion, across the ancient hall ? He stepped up to one of them. He felt the face. AU wood I Nothing but wood ! The feet \u2014 the hands. All wood ! And yet had he not seen one of them step down and walk away ? And waa there not the empty pedestal from which he had stepped ? It would be a curious thing to revisit that hall in the open daylight, and see if that one had re turned to its pedestal. Heron made np his mind, corre what come might, to do so without fail. But now he hears the Palace clock. He waa about to step forth into the old haU. He pauses. The blood seema, for a moment, to stop about his heart. Can he believe hia eyes ? 0_ e of the effigies of the men-at-arms mevea. One of those false representations of old times ia actually in motion. The long halberd shakes. The cold moon beams shift upon the helmet with its iron-barred visor. It chimes the three-quarters past eleven. A feeUng of anxiety takes possession of Heron's mind to get back to the rooms that had been as signed to him as the Baron Von Peck. The King might come at twelve. Hark! The figure slowly steps from a short kind of pedestal, on which it had stood grim and still, and elowly walks across the reflection of the painted window on the floor of the great had. Felix Heron feels no terror. The rattle\u2014 the roU of carriage wheels sounds on the old stonea of one of the court-; arda. It might be the King ! Heron hastily left the haunted banqueting ball \u2014 for such must be the character it bears in hia mind \u2014 and made the best of his way back to the rooms he had so recently left He went by the secret doora and the secret stairs, closing both the doors after him. Only for one passing moment he paused at the door of Marianna'a chamber to Usten. He ia not perplexed with alarm, but he owns to himseU at the moment that he has never been so surprised in all hia life before. He can make nothing of it ! No rational supposition can aid him at the moment in coming to any conclusion in regard to the phenomenon, except that it ia supernatural. Slowly \u2014 very slowly \u2014 the figure moves on. Heron is half in the mind to saUy forth and question it. To aaUy forth, and intercept it in its slow and stately march across that moon-lighted floor- Bet a new phenomenon, and one that causes him to shrink back, presents Used. As the figure passes over the reflected appear ance of the painted window on the old oaken floor, he has a good opportunity of looking at it Of looking at it welL What does he see ? All was still. Then he passed on, and reached his own sitting room. It was a relief to him, after what he had since heard in Wolsey'- Hall, to seat himself in peace by the log fire that burnt cheerfully on the hearth. Bnt Heron waa not left long to himself, or to hia own reflection. A tap canoe at hia door. \" Ccme in.\" The man who had directed him from the garden to hia rooma appeared. \" A gentleman, Baron, wiU caU to fee yon.\" Heron rose. The figure ia tall. Tall above the ordinary height of men. The helmet, and tke face, and the head are there. A figure in a camlet-oloak entered the room, and the man who had announced the \"gentle man\" softly closed the door behind it The figure cast off the oloak. \" Woll, Baron, you-are snugly honied here 1\" It was the King. \" I am, your Majesty.\" \" And your fair oharge ? Is she quite well ?\" \" I hope so.\" \"Ah! and ao do we \u2014 and so do we. Well, Baron, we are always grateful for good service.\" Heron bowed. The King flung himseU into a ohair by the fire side, and rubbed his hands together, as though he were cold. \" I had eome thought, Baron, of making a royal residence of Hampton Court again, bat it ia far from town.\" But there is no neck ! Something\u2014 he cannot tell what it is \u2014 but it is something stern and rigid\u2014 holds up the head at a height of about two feet from tbe body ! And in this manner the figure takes its way slowly over the floor of the ball ! Heron watched it with his eyes. It disappeared in the glcom at the further end of the haU, and the last he saw of it was the faint gleam cf the moonlight upon the elevated helmet npon the elevated head. Then Heron rushed into the hall. \"Hold ! hold !\" he oried. \"If you be mortal, turn and face me ! If immortal, say why it is that jou haunt these bygone halls ! Speak \u2014 ob, speak !\" His own voice echoing among tbe dust - cov d burners overhead waa the only response. He had, to all appearance, Wolaey's great ban qeeting ball solely to himself.

A bright flame shot up. \" Well, Baron, end what is your opinion of our royal orphan?\" \" She ia very beautiful\" \"Ah!\" clared his true opinion of the atrocious principles set forth by his Majesty. But he kept his thoughts to himself. It required an effort of self-control, but yet he succeeded. \" Ton see, Baron,\" added the King, \" I have a small key here.\" \" I do see.\" \" Well, it is the passport to the arms of Marianna.\" \" She is very good, too, I think.\" \"Eh?\" \" I said good. I mean virtuous snd pure minded, \u2014 one of those gentle English girls into whose innocent mind no thonght of evU has ever strayed.\" \"Her arms?\" \" Tes. I admit that she is not well disposed to my Bait ; but what then ? This Palace is large, and I flatter myself that a scream will reach no other ears but yours.\" Heron could not speak. He felt aa though his heart was swelling nigh to bursting. \" And that,\" added the King,\" will, of course, be of no consequence. Now, Baron, you are tall, and you look strong. I daresay you are a tolerable master of fence ?\" \"Oh!\" The King kicked another bit of wood. \" And so that ia your opinion, Baron ?\" \" It is, your Majesty.\" \" Well, it is ours, too.\" \"And yet \" . \"Eh?\" The King turned half-rcnnd upon his chair, and looked at Heron in suspense. \" Pray, go on, Baron.

Felix Heron felt his breath come short and thick as he looked at the King, and wondered what wonld be the events of the next half-hour. \" Tou have said it.\" As he spoke, the King took from a pseket of his coat a rolled up mask of black silk. This mask was ao weU contrived tbat, by means of eome elastic bands that went behind the head, it could be fitted very accurately to the face \u2014 fitting, in fact, into the features, so aa to be a mo.t perfect and complete diacnise to any one who might wear it Heron locked upon it with a shndder !

With the black mask crumpled up in his hand along with the small key he had produced, he paced the chamber to and fro twice in its entire length. As he so paced it, Heron heard him muttering to himself disjointed sentences. \"No, no! It cannot be \u2014 it is not possible; aud, besi .'es, it can never happen again, for the gilc bars that I have had put to the inside of that par ticular window. It is no warning on that ac count; and yet\u2014 yet it disturbs me. Baron!\" \"Tour Majesty.\" \" Have you mentioned this to any one \u25a0 bnt na?\" \" And your. Majesty ?\" The Kin^Iaugbed again. \" We have eur own route to that chamber.\" Aa he spoke, he held up the little key. Heron then felt convinced of what he had already surmised; namely, that the KiBg knew of some secret route to the sleeping-room of Mari anna. It was eqnally evident, tco, that that secret route waa not about to be communicated to him, Heron ; for the King, although he held up the key, turned neither to the right nor to the left, but still faced the wood fire. Heron could do nothing but obey. Or, rather, he had no resource but to seem to obey. \" Tour Majeaty,\" he said, \" will aUow me a few minutes' time to find the way ?\" \" Oi\u00bb take your time.\" \" I a-k it for a reason.\" \" Not to a soul !\" \" That is well\u2014 that is well !\" There was wine upon the table; although, how it came there, Heron knew not unless it were there placed while he was pursuing bis explora tions in the old banqueting hall of the Cardinal There it was, however, and the King ooured himself out a good bumper, and drank it off. \"My own prime Burgundy,\" he said. No doubt the attendant, who was on the alert in and abont the Palace, had placed the King's favourite wine on that table specially for him. The colour came back to the palhd face of the King. \" Baron,\" he said, \" a thousand ghoate slrall not deter me from the expedition of to-night !

What\u2014 what next?\" \" I approached the figure, and, as the moon at that moment sh^ne out, I saw it plainly.\" \"PUinly?\" \" Tuo plainly 1\" Felix Heron was resolved, by this made-up story, to see what effect he conld produce upon tbe imagination and the fears of the bad King. The ieac-er will see ihat Heron based his pre tended nurritive upon that terrible episode of the couit yard, that bud b'en related by the old lady with whom Edith was staying. Aud the K'ng was really alarmed. Ha took off the black mask, and looked with terrified eyes in the face of Her, n. \" Wnat\u2014 tthat then?\" \"This way, sir!\" Heron started. Exactly on the threshold was that tronbltsome and obsequious servant. \" Wbat way?\" \" This is the way to the young lady's cbamler door, air \" \" I know it\" \" But I wiU keep you company, sir.\" \"I think not, unless I come down stairs and stay with you, scoundrel '\" Heron, with one straightforward blow, sent the fellow right down the staircase to the corridor below, and the fall was so rapid that it made very little noise, and there lay tbe man like a corpse. \" What surprised me, your Majpsty, was that the figure was so transparent I could see through it the old groined arches of the court, and yet at the same time the figure had a sufficiently pal pable ou lino \" \" What did it do?

That little action waa a great relief to Heron, ac it allowed him to feel that he had got rid by it of the pent-np wrath in hia bosom. Without bestowing another glance at tbe dis oomfi'ed King's confidential servant, he made his way, as fast as he could go, to Marianna's cham ber door. \" Ten minutes,\" he said to himself. \" The King said ten minutes.\" He rapped at the door.

Felix Heron was astonished. The moment he slid aside the secret panel, there fell headlong to his feet the very apparition of the a' me d man he hid seen in Wolney's ban queting bull! The man-a'-arm', with Ihe bead and helmet perched on tbe top of some slender apology for a Lect, two feet or more iu length ! A night light, that burnt on a gilt braoket in Marianna's room, lent suffieieut light for Heron to recognise the temo_e sppari ion.

And but for tho discovery he had just made of th,: identity of Tom, what a capital ghost story in connexion with Hampton Court he might have told! An eye-witness, too, of it ! But Heron had no inclination to pause in hia route to where ha should find Edith, to whom he wished to give the charge of M -rianna. The young girl clung to Heron confidingly aa she said, with an air of candid simplicity, \" Dear sir, what is it aU about?\" \"Danger!\" \" What danger ?\" \" Do not ask further, bnt reat satisfied that heaven and myself, as ita humble instrument, have rescued yon from it, and that it wiU not occur again.\" \" Ah, Baron, then I have indeed found a true friend in you !\" \" It is so ; bat I am not what I seem.\" That was the ever recurring question that Tom Ripon put to himself. He waa soon to find out As Tom stood dose by the little night-light he beard a singular noiie behind the wainscot of one part of the room. \" Mice !\" said Tom. And indeed that seemed to be the moat practical as well aa the most rational supposition, if it were the most common-place. The odd noise continued. Click went something like a lock. \" It isn't mice,\" said Tom. The next idea of Tom Ripon was to put on1 the light, so that whoever waa making a way into the room should not luwe the advantage of knowing be was there ; bnt his own curiosity to know and see who it was overcame that impulse, and he left the light alone. But Tom darted behind the curtaina of the bed, and drew them close- Indeed, he jutnped on to the bed itself, and covered himself over with a satin counterpane that had belonged to one of the old state beds of Hampton Court. Then Tom waited. He he ird a door gently creak npon its hinges. He heard a footstep A alo ,7 and stealthy one- Tom was armed. His right hand strayed to the bntt of a pistol that he had in a pocket he could just get at, in spite of the encumbrance of that abominable old cuirass \" Indeed !' \" I am not a baron.\" \" Not a baron ?\" \"No; I am the Earl of Whitcombe, sometimea called Felix Haron, of whom you may have heard ; and the lady into whose care I am about to place you. is Edith, my own true, and gentle, and loving Countesa !\" The King did not know bis danger. He waa the intruder; and if Tom Ripon had taken auch a thing into hia head, he was just as likely to fire the pistol and then ask, \" Who are you ?\" afterwards, as not. But it was the total absence of fear on the occa sion that made Tom forbearing. CHAPTER COIII. TOM RIPON ASTONISHES AND TERRIFIES THE KING, AND HALF KILLS LORD CLACKIKGT.N. Cowards only are hasty with violence. The stealthy footstep approached. \" Hem !\" aaid a voice. \"What doea that mean?\" thought Tom. \" Hem !\" said the voice again \" Well,\" thonght Tom, \" I may as well say ' Hem 1' too, whatever that may mean.\" \"Hem!\" Tom spake, with the satin counterpane muffl.d over his face a good deal. \"Beautiful being,\" said the voice, \"are ycu awake ?\" \"The denes!\" thought Tom. \"Who does he take me for?\" \" Ftdr girl, are your rosy slumbers broken?\" \" Oh, that's it 1\" thought Tom. He replied in a little, low, squeaking voice, tbat waa as unlike that of Marianna as anything could be ; but tho King was not disposed to be at that moment critical in voices. Tom Ripon was a true lover of adventure. He was without fear likewise, so that he waa just the- person to enjoy with infinite zest whatever lortune threw in his way of the strange and the wonderful. . Now, when Felix Heron pushed Tom into the chamber of the fair Marianna, he felt certain that some service was required of* him in that direc tion, which it would be on hia part a duty and a sati .faction to render. Tom therefore made no opposition to the ar rangement. To be sure, ho was rather encumbered with that Henry the Eighth ouirasa that he wore, and with those immenie boots in whioh he had en cased his legs. But those were minor considerations. There he was, in the chamber of the young girl who had a', one glance taken his heart captive, aud, aa he himself expreaeed it, induced him to \"give up all the othera,\" be they whom they might. She was not there. \" Tes, I'm awake.\" \"Oh, dear one I\" \" ctet out, do 1\" \"Eh?\" \"Go along 1\" ' . \"Oh, Marianna, can it be possible that you do not, after all, view with great alarm my presence here?\" \" Oa, gammon !\" \"Oh, what?\" The King was fast lapsing into a state of blank amaztnent He began to doubt if he were in his right senaes. Of course, that' waa a drawback, bat stUl it was her room; and Tom looked about him well pleased, but wondering, after aU, what he was there for The small night-light, with ita tiny flame, sent a faint kind of twilight over the apartment. He saw various articles of feminine apparel about, and on the toilet table a pair of ear-rings and a small finger-ring with a turquoise ia it But still, why was he there ?"], [85, "79 EDITH HERON. Or if he were, certainly the fair and gentle Marianna had bidden adieu tc hers. \" Oaptain !\" \" Tes, Tom \u2014 come up hero!\" \" AU right, Captain !\" Tom began to climb up to the window by the door-post, and any Uttle projc c.ions he could find, with the agility of a aqoirrel. \" I did not intend that,\" sa'd Heron. \" If you had rung tho boll, you would be admitted.\" \" All right, Oaptain! Here I am.\" And there indeed was Tom at the window, when Felix Heron helped him in. Three ladies were in the room. \" Dear girl,\" he aaid, \"you ao grossly astonish ms that know not what to say to you !\" \" Wa'ker !\" said Tom. \"Who?\" \" Get away, bad man ! Don't come here trying to deceive a respectable young woman!\" \"Good graoious!\" \" Amen ! If y u want to say your prayers, be off somewhere el_=e, and let me go to sleep !\" \" Marianna !\" \"Well, what now?\" \" Are you talking in your sleep, or is it possible th\u201et, after all, tbe aeemingj gentlenesa and in nocence of jour tone and manner waa but a sable cloak to cover what you reaUy are !\" \"A what?\" Edith, her friend (who resided in the Palace of Hampton Court) and Marianna. The moment Tom lookod uy.on Marianna again he assumed as attitude of the most intense adora tion, bsit Captain Heron checked him by saying, \" This is no time, Tom, for gaUantry. Tou must remain here, and protect these ladies \" \" Tes, Captain I\" \" I have important business in another part of the Pakce.\" \"Aaablecloak!\" \" I never heard of such a thing !\" \" Oh, Marianna ! Marianna ! I love you ! I lovo yon wilh all my heart \u2014 with all my soul 1 Accept the adoration of one who \" The King had, while Bpfaking in this ena moured strain, approaohed the side of the bed. Tom thought the joke might just as well come to an end. Suddenly jumping up in the bed with the pUlow in his hand, he uttered a loud yeli that struok terror into the heart of the King. Accompanying the yell, tho pillow was dashed into the royal countenance with a bewildering effect. Felix 3eron felt the necessity of as soon as pos sible seeing tho King, and putting the best com plexion he could upon the royal disappointment. It felt now much easier to Heron to play a. part in regard to the King and Marianna than it was before. He was now the victor. Before, aU waa vague uncertainty, and he could not tell how thing- would turn out. \" Edith,\" he <aid, \" and you, Marianna, remain here at peace, ana be assured that all danger is now over \" The King felL Tom leaped ont o? bed with the taU boots, and alighted exactly on the royal chest The King shouted for help. \" Take that!\" said Tom,aa he dealt him several hearty kicks. \" lies, Felix,\" replied Edith ; \" it ia all over, and most happily over, too ; and with this dear girl as a companion and friend for the time to come, I shall learn to think of the events oi this night without regret\" \" And I, too I\" said Marianna. The tears gathered in her eyeg aa she spoke, and she took the hand of Felix Heron in both her own. \"Help! help! murder!\" \" And take that, too !\" added Tom Ho danced a sort of pas seul on the King, to the great detriment of hia animal economy ; and then, darting towards the door, Tom made his escape, and ran down the staircase \"Nay,\" said Heron, \" y n owe me few thanks, Marianna; for if I tad not dono what I have, I should have been tl e most unhappy wretch beneath the sun to-mor sow!\" As he went, Tom made efforts to rid himself of the cuiias;, and succeeded in getting it off him. \" Bother you !\" he said, aa he apostrophised the awkward piece of metal; \"I wonder the fellows ia those old timea ever pat on suoh a weight of o'.d iron I I would rather have gone into one of tho jolly fights without it fifty timed aver!'1 The boots Tom easily got rid of. He aat down on the ataira, and thrust the huge feet of them through **.<_ balustrades, and so ex tracted his legs from them. The bools had rather a comical appearance, stuck, soles outwards, through thoae balustrades And Tom had his own shoes on independently of those anoient boots, so that he felt, now that he had got rid of those encumbrances, light and active as a harlequin. His object was to find out Captain Heron and Edith as soon as poasible, and in that he succeeded more quickly than he could well have hoped. Turning abruptly into one of the courts of the Palace, Tom heard a voice pronounce his name. \"Tern! Tom! Tom!\" Heron then hastily left the apartments of the lady who had so ki idly obliged Edith with a shelter, and made the best of his way back to tho place of contest bos ,? een Tom Ripon and the King. Captain Heron wr j, by so very frequently tra versing the same r ute, tolerably weU acquainted with ic The consequence was that he reached the door of Marianna's chamber in a very short apace of time indeed. # At firs'. Heron was of opinion that the King had fled. But such was not thc case ; and Heron heard soma one uttering doleful moans and groans from the chamber. He felt certain that some one could be no other than the King. Secretly delighted at his full and complete dis comfiture, Heron entered the chamber. \"Murder!\" cried the King. At the sound of Captain Heron's footsteps, he thought it possible enough that whoever had assailed him before waa now coming back to finish the business. \" Here you are!\" \"This way! Up here!\" Tom looked np in the direotion the sound cime from, and he saw a dim and dusky form at a window; but dim and dueky as it was, Tom Ripon had no difficulty in recognising it aa Captain Heron. \"Murder! murder!\" \" What do I hear ?\" cried Heron. \"Eh? what?

Has your Majesty, theD, altered your opinion of the oharms of tnat beauti ful girl ?\" \" Baron, you will oblige us much by holding your tongue.\" \" Certainly.\" \" Now help us to get up.\" Tbe kickg wilh which Tom Ripon had saluted royalty, and the maniacal kind of dance that Tom had execute-1 upon the very body of the King, as be lay on the chamber floor, had not been at all beneficial. \" Oh ! oh ! Gently, Baron. ConfonDd it, how has all thia ha opened? I will take the Use of somebody for thia!\" The King look'd vexed. He had certainly. \u00bbt the instant, forgotten how sedulously he bad Ircpt from Heron a knowledge of the means by which he could make his way to that sleeping chamber of youth, innocence, and beauty. He strr ve now to make a virtue of neceaaity. \" Yon see, Baron, how entirely we trutt you, by speaking thus freely to you.\" \"I do see it, your Majesty, and am grateful accordingly.\" At this moment, to tell the trnth, Heron started as much as the King, for a slight continuous rap ping came at the chamber door, which was par tially closed. It was not etiquette of the King to take ony notice of this demand for admission. Felix Heruu had no such scrup'es, and while he laid [his hand upon hia swoid, he cried aloud, \"Come in.\" The person who presented himself was tbat u=eful sorvsnt of bis Majesty, who had been snch au annoyance to hlerou, by prowling about the precincti of Hampton Court curing the whole pro ceedings of that night. The appearance of this man waa lugubrious in the extreme, for the tumble he had had down the staircase had by no meanB improved his gene ral appearance. At the sight of Felix Heron and the King, he raised a cry of indignation and rage. \" Justice 1 juatiee ! Help! Consume him! Con found him! He pretends to be in your Majesty's confidential service, and p tchea me Leadlongdoiva the staircase fie to break one's neck. CHAPTER CCIV. CAPTAIN HBP.ON RETAINS THE KING'S CONFI- DENCE, AND REMAINS AT HAMPTON COURT. \"Eh? Wnat, Baton? What is this?\" Heron feignea a look of perfect amazament. \"I think we are attacked by fiends to-nigbt, who assume each other's likeness, for I cou'd have sworn that this man, who represents himself to be a servant of your Maj f sty, was one of the rascils who Bet npon me aud half killed me, at the mo ment thought I heard jour Majesty's voice in this room calling for assistance.\" \" Aud I am ready to take my oath at any mo ment,\" said the man, advancing into the apart ment, and glaring at Heron like an enraged hyena, \" that you pitched me from top to bottom of the staircase, with no more ceremony than o_ though I bad been a Back of coals.\" \"All this transcends belief,\" said the Kirg, \" and puzzles and confounds us.\" Felix Heron shrugged his shoulders, and pat on a look of innocent cauUoar, aa mnch as to say, \" Well, I cannot explain all this, but ao it is.\" The King looked from him to the servant, and from the servant back to him again, and was evi dently at a loss to ceme to any reasonable cocclu olusion upon tbe sut j -ct. There was one point, however, upon which he soon became anxious. \" Baron,\" he said, \" where is Marianna all this time ? Has she disappeared amid all the confusion of people and ideas?\" \" That is not at all likely, your Majeaty. My firm impression still is that she is within tne pre cincts of the Palace.\" If anything could be more amusing than another to Captain Heron, it would certainly be this im potent rage of the King, Knowing that Marianna was so perfectly safe from even a semblance of any farther danger, he could well afford to amibi at any threats the King miubt deliver himself of. \" Do you mean to tel! me, Baron, that you, too. have been a sufferer by this night's adven tures ? \" I find a difficulty, ycir Majesty, in moving one arm and both ray legs.\" \"Ah! and we find a ilifficnlty not only in movirg our a-rns and legs, *)ut our body likewise Had ic been but tvo or tl ree persona who at tacked na, we might have i ought a good fight, and protected ouraelvea; h-_,l give me leave to aaanre you, Baron, that we have been set upon by a multitude of traitors, and nearly pommelled to death.\" Felix Heron had great difficulty in preserving his countenanen while the King thus spoke, know ing, as he did so well, that it was Tom Ripon alone who had produced all the mischief. The King was evidently badly bruised, and made many wry faces as Felix Heron helped him to a chair, from which he was able to look about him by that dim niaht-light which still burnt in the chamber of the fair and innocent Marianna. That chamber that would never again be lighted up by the fair beauty of that incomparable girl. \" Go I\" said tbe King, with a wave of his hand that at onca dismissed the Serving-man. \"Baron Von Peck?\" \" Tes,\" said tbe King, \" there is the couch on \u2022vVich she slept, or was to have slept ; and there is the seoret door in the panelling, exactly behind * I attend your Majesty.\""], [87, "81 EDITH HERON. \" There is evidently more in all thia than marts discoveries you can, and present vourself t. ua at thc morning reception.\" \" I shall not fail to do so.\" ft>e eye.\" \" A great deal more,\" replied Heron. \" Tou a^e a bravo man, and you arp weU armed. Will you search this portion of the Palace with a scrupulous attention whioh will convince us the girl is here or not here ?\" - 1 wUl do your Majeaty'a behests,\" said Heron, as he drew his sword ; \" but npon the possibility of a second attack being made upon yonr royal person, I grieve to leave you in this cham ber.\" \" We shall be at St James's. Good nig_t, Baron!\" There waa a bitterneis of expression about the manner of the King that Bhowed he deeply felt his disappointment ; but it waa especially gratify ing to Felix Heron to hear him express his inten tion of immediately leaving Hampton Court. Such an event, so immediately taking place after tbe eacape of Marianna from that chamber of guflt and mieery, would afford an opoortunity for more permanent measures being taken for her safety. The King walked with difficulty, and leant heavily npon the arm of Felix Heron aa they proceeded together down the staircase that led to the lower part of the Palace. The obsequious and useful servant was there \" Did you suppose, Baron, for a single moment,\" cried the King, springing to his feet with much more alacrity, considering the damage he had re ceived, than could have been expected, \u2014 \"did yon su.pose for a moment that we were going to ex pose ourselves to such a contingency ? No, Baron, we have had enough of it for this night, and we shall return to town immediately. Make what Edith \u2014No 63."], [88, "82 EDITH HERON. and, in truth, that man seemed to have the faculty cf always making his appearance at the exact moment he waa wanted. It must have been a special talent, and had no donbt recomorended him to a high place in the favour of his royal master. kindly for what she haa already done, and leave her for the present, perhaps to see her again in happier times.\" \" Bnt whither shall we go, Felix ?\" \" Let me think a moment.\" One \u2014 two \u2014 sounded the dock at Hampton Court \" The carriage,\" said the King. Tbe serving-man immediately disappeared with out a word. \" My curses alight upon the rascals who have assailed me to-night, Baron ! I am f uU of aches and bruisee.\" The honr was late. \"At half-past four the dawn will begin to show itself.\" \" My advice,\" said Heron, \" is that we rest for two hours, or more, in the old Palace. The rooms that have been assigned to me as tbe Baron Yon Peck are still at my disposal. The King has gone to town, and has taken with him the only man who would be incUned to be troublesome.\" Felix Heron conld scarcely prevent a covert smile from playing npon his lips aa he heard the King thus speak in the plural of his assailants, knowing, as he did so well, that Tom Ripon was answerable for all the damage the royal person had sustained- There was a slight reluctance on the part of Edith, which almost took the character of a fore boding of evil, on account of their staying even for bo short a time beneath the roof of the great Cardinal's old Palace. The ubiquitous servant, who made himself so useful, must have had a suspicion that, after what had happened, the King would take his route to London with aU possible speed, or tbe carriage with its four horses and two postiliens that had brought him down to Hampton Oourt could never have been ready in bo short a space of time as had elapsed before they were again at his Majesty's disposal. \" Baron, once more, good night ! I leave yon to unravel as best you may this tangled web of mystery and suspicion which attaches to the pro ceedings of Marianna.\" \" I have the honour to bid your Majesty good night, and to aay that I will do the best I can,\" responded Heron. The carriage drove off. Felix Heron drew a long breath of relief, for he saw that, at* sign from tbe King, tbe trouble some and useful servant bad mounted into a eort of rumble behind, and had gone to town with his iniquitous master. \" So far, all is well,\" said Heron. \" Edith and Marianna shell rest to-night at Hampton Court and, by the earliest and faintest streak of dawn to-morrow, they shall start for Whitcombe House, whish will probably be the last place in all London which will suggest itself to the rind of the King as the retreat of the fair fugitive, whose destruction ho aims at\" Bnt she forbore to urge her fears. They did not stand the test of a few moments' mental examination, and therefore she dismissed them. \" Marianna,\" said Heron, as he turned to the young girl, \"shaU you now be content to be the friend and guest of the Countess of Whit combe ?\" \" Oh, yes,\" repUed Marianna, \" for all my Use!\" Heron then, after due acknowledgments had been made to the old lady, led the way across the court-yard with Edith and Marianna towards the staircase, whioh led to that part of the Palace assigned as his residence. Tom Ripon foUowed them. \" Captain,\" he said, \" what am I to do ? Hadn't I better prowl about here, and pounoe upon anybody who ahows himself?\" \" Tou may prowl about as much as you like, Tom \u2014 but beware who you pounce upon ; for I do not think there are any persons here inclined to interfere with ns, if we have the prudence to leave them alone.\" \" All right, Captain,\" said Tom. \" Tou can always depend upon a man like me being a model of discretion.\" Felix Heron did not consider that any caution was now necessary ; for, so to speak, armed as he was with an express authority from the King, he might consider himself the moat important per sonage at Hampton Court. He by no means, however, abandoned his dis guise of the Baron Von Peck ; but, without any special caution as regarded hia movements, he croaaed the court-yard which led to the lodgings of the lady with whom Edith and Maiianna had found a lefuge. \" All is well,\" he said. \"We are safe, and there is no royalty in Hampton Court I\" Edith took Heron aside, and spoke to him ear- Felix Heron was not at all uneasy as to what might become of Tom Bipon, sinoe the Palace abounded with places of shelter, in any one of which he could m-ke himself quite comfortable for tbe two or three hours they were aU likely to remain beneath its roof. There waa only ore thought that occurred to him aa worthy of a little r. flection, and he won dered that that had not struck him before; bnt, amid the turmoil of events that had taken place during the last two hours, the subject had entirely escaped him. What had become of Marianna's deaf and pur blind governess? That was tbe question he now put to him eelf. nestly. \" I feel, Felix, that by remaining another mo ment here in these apartments, we are endanger ing the subsistence and safety of the kind, friend who haa opened them to us.\" \" Has she said as muoh, Edith ?\" It was one, however, which Marianna would be herself able to answer accurately ; and when they had reached the sitting-room allotted to him by the arrangements of the King, and he had stirred the logs npon the hearth until they sent forth a cheerful flame, he spoke to the young girl upon the subject. \" Tour governess, Marianna \u2014 nhat has become of her?\" \" No, Felix ; but I can gather it ; and it would be ungenerous.\" \"Tes, Edith,\" interrupted Heron; \"and unjust Uke w Le for us to remain here, to the detriment of any one.\" \" I knew you would say so.\" \" Let us, then, thank this lady warmly and \" I was going to speak to you of her.\" \" Indeed I\""], [89, "EDITH HERON. 83 \" Tea. I am convinced ahe ia neither so bUnd nor so deaf as she assumed to be\" A feeling of intense alarm came over the heart of Heron. It waa not on his own account that he felt it, but on account of Marianna and on account of Editb, A sudden pang of alarm \u2014 not on his own ac count, but on that of Marianna \u2014 shot aercaa the heart of Felix Heron at those words. \" Tell me aU you know, Marianna,\" he said ; \" and what has given rise to thia idea-\" \" After we had retired for the night into that apartment from which yon took me, Bhe turned sharply towards me, shaking off very much the appearance of age aud decrepitnde, and in a voice very different from any I had ever heard her apeak in before, Bhe told me it was my own fault if I were not a duchesa within a month.\" What it would be most adviaable to do under the circumatancea he could not on the spar of that instant decide. Bat he made one vigorous attempt to force the door, which even the t tardy oak of which it waa oompo.ed, and the ma. .ive lock that held it, felt the force of. Hampton Court Palace, however, waa built at a time when the art of running np structures with the least possible quantity of material was not re cognised. It still resisted him. \" And you, Marianna \u2014 what reply did yon make?\" \" I was alarmed and surprised, and said some thing \u2014 I know not what \u2014 to which she replied as promptly and as quickly as any one could with a full sense of hearing about them.\" \"There is danger 1\" cried Fi'ix Heron; \"and we will not stay another hour in Hampton Court\" Then a thonght occurred to Heron, which be resolved at once to put into practice. The door of the chamber so recently in tbe occupation of the beautiful Marianna might stUl be open ; and if so, the secret route in the thickness of the wall, between tbat room and the one where he had left Edith and Marianna, might be available. CHAPTER COY. Heron did not pause to reaaon further upon thia idea. CAPTAIN HI RON MEETS WITH A GREAT SUR- PRISE, AND EDITH AND MARIANNA ARE IN PERIL. He slew, rather than ran, to carry it into execu tion. Tea, the door of Marianna's room was on the latch ; co inducement had presented itaelf to any one to dose it The danger that menaced the little party in that suite of rooms in the old Palace was none the less that it waa undefined With a bound, Heron waa in the apartment His feelings were wrought up to tbe highest pitch of anxiety, for he heard, or he thought he heaid, at the moment tbat he reached the sleeping apartment of Marianna a scream. A muffled scream, aa though it only came to his eara through the intervention of many doors. It might have been only fancy. Or it might have been tbe night wind among the old weather vanes of the Palace. But its presarc\u00bb, or its probable presence, was to the mind of Felix Heron ao palpable a fact that he could not reat without taking some immediate step to arrest it \" Edith, dear Edith, and you, Marianna, make what preparations you can on the moment to leave this place \" \" I am ready, Felix.\" \" And T,\" said Marianna, as she clung to tho arm of Edith. But still it might be reality ; and if so, it was suggestive of some great perU to those whom he loved. \" I will call to Tom Ripon,\" said Captain Heron: \" he is. no doabt, close at hand \" Looks of alarm now passed between Edith and Marianna, for they could cot doubt the existence of real danger since it was so evident to Felix Heron. To Edith. And to Marianna. With frenzied eagerness Heron felt for the secret panel in the waU by which the King had made his way on the unhallowed enand that brought him there in'o that room. His haste, aa haate alwaya will when it de generates into hurry, defeated his intentions. It was to minutes before he found the panel, and opened it. Then Heron darted along the narrow secret passage with a speed that, at various turnings, brought him into rude contact with the walla. He reached the corresponding opening in the waU of his own sitting-room, and without caring what damage he did, he dashed it open. Edith! He stepped on to the corridor at the common ce ment of the enite of rooms, to call to Tom Ripon. \"Tom! Tom I\" There was no reply. With an undefined feeling of apprehension at his heart. Heron ran down the flight of stairs to the court-yard. \" Tom 1 Tom !\" Still no reply. If Tom Ripon did not answer to a call from hia much-loved master, Felix Heron, it was quite clear cither that it did not reach his ears, or, if it did, be was not in a position to speak. That something had taken place that was sig nificant of danger, and that siiU more might ensue, Heron felt convinced. He ran np the staircase again, and reached the door of the outer room of the suite that had been assigned to him in the Palace- Marianna ! B th those names were on his lips as he looked around him in blank amazement The room was empty. Completely deserted of human occupation. The wood fire still burnt in the low-lying iron supports of the logs. A couple of wax candles were still alight on the table. A glove lay upon the floor. And that was all that remained of Edith and of Marianna. He had only a few minutes before passed through tbat door, and left it half dosed. Of tbat he waa certain. But now it was fast, and no power tbat he was capable of exerting at the moment was able to stir it Heron clasped his head with bis hands."], [90, "84 EDITH HERON. A burning, hot feel was about his brow. Was he mad ? That was the terrible question he put to him self. And then, by a powerful effort of that will which he had on so many occaaiona of danger aud difficulty appealed to, and not in vain, he forced himself to ce calm. doorway where Felix Heron stood, concealed in the deep night gloom. Indeed, the person, whoever it was, dropped gently npon Heron, and he had only to stretch forth his arms to hold it tightly. From the touch of the clothing, the form was feminine. The slight scream that came from the person so surpriaed waa further proof of that fact \" 0 a, are yoa Cosmo ?\" \" Tee.\" \" No, no ! \" he said. \"Let what may have hap pened, I will keep a heart and brain to meet it!\" He held up one of the candles, and made a more minute examination of the apartment. There was nothing there to remind him of the so late presence of Edith but that glove. Tt was a glove of Edith'a. With the wax-light in his hand, Felix Heron went into the next room, which was that assigned to him in bis character of the Baron Yon Peck, as a sleeping chamber. \" What a fright you gave me !\" \"Did I?\" \" To be sure you did- Who would have thonght of your being juat inside this door way ? \" \" Ah, tc be sure !\" \"Eh?\" \" I said, 'Ah, to be sire !'\" \" Well, your cold i. worse, I wUl believe now, for it haa qu'te affected your voice.\" By this, Felix Heron found how nearly he was betraying the fact that he was not the person named Cosmo, for whom the woman mistook him. That was quite undisturbed. The quietude of tbe suite of rooms grew pain ful. They began to have the feel and the aspect of a prison. Editb, Marianna, Tom R!pon \u2014 where could they be ? Spirited away, as it appeared, by some power able to work in silence and safety. But he, Heron, bad heard the tramp of horses' feet in the Cardinal's Couit He pretended to cough. \" Yes, my cold is bad.\" \" It's a shame, as I have often said, for Crown to keep you waiting about staircases so much. You are always in draughts; and if you don't catch your death of cold, I will say it is no fault of Crown's\" He had he\u00bbrd the roll of carriage wheela. There could be no doubt whatever on thoio points- Was that carriage and i's horses still there? Heron made his way back to the chamber of Marianna, and be looked as well as he could through the barred-up casement. \" None in the least \" Did the woman mean the King by that nick name of Crown? It waa more than probable that she did. Felix Heron was exceedingly desirous that she should Bay sometbijg of more importance than mere chat about his cold. The cold moonbeams fell placidly and calmly upon the old, silent fountain, but no appearance cf either carriage or horsea presented itself. To look at that silent court, one would hardly have supposr d that any footstep either of horse or man had disturbed it aince the daya of the great Cardinal, who no _oubt had looked with plea su-e upon the aparkling waters of its now silent fountain. And she soon did so. \" Now, Cosmo.\" she aaid, \" tell me who the pretended Baron Von Peck really is ?\" \" I don't know.\" \" Oh, you must know. I confeas that he puzzles me; but, in my own mind, I never had a doubt, from the first moment I saw him, that he waa playing a part,\" \" So much for my disguiae!\" thought Heron. \" Yes,\" he replied ; \" that waa my own idea, too.\" Heron felt a poaitive pain now at hia heart, and every nerve in hia body seemed jingled and out of tune. It wa8 the dreadful feeling of want of power of action that came over him so depressingly. He was about to turn from the window, when he saw a shadow close to the fountain. \" But,\" added the woman, \" he never suspected that in the old, deaf, and half-blind governess, he had me to contend with \" A slowly-moving shadow, that had the outline of a human form unmistakably. That aome one waa stealthily creeping along the cloisters on one Bide of tbe court-yard, Heron did not doubt for a passing instant. He watched tho shadow to 863 in whioh direc tion it went. Here was a revelation ! This woman, then, waa that very governess who, from her infirmities, had seemed to be bo entirely unfit for the service of the fair Mari anna. She waa in reality, then, nothing in the world but a spy ! Thia waa news to Felix Heron \u2014 news that almost induced him to stretch forth hia hand and hold her aa a prisoner. To the right. Tbat waa enough. In the aborteat possible space of time that aught human could pass through the space to be tra versed, Ftlix Heron waa at the doorway that led into the court- yard at the foot of the stair case. But he abstained ; for he thought, and no donbt rightly, too, that she was likely to give him more valuable information still. \" He never once suspected you ?\" said Heron. \" Of courae not I flatter myself I can play my part rather too weU for that.\" \" Of oourse\u2014 of courae.\" \" And I took good care to keep such an eye upon the Baron Von Peck that I was able to open Crown's eyes a little.\" \" Yes. yes.\" \" And ao he ia off ?\" He saw the shadow still. Slowly it passed over the fountain; and, by the direction it took, he felt certain that the substance that projected it would pass exactly where he stood. He waa not disappointed. Not only did the form that oast the shadow come in that direction, but it turned in at the very \" Ob, yes. The Baron, do you mean ?\""], [91, "85 EDITH HERON. LitOe did 6he think that probably no ono ia iu the world knew Tom Ripon, and what he was likely !o do under any given e^t of circumstanc.9, so well aa the person she was speaking to. But still Heron had not the exact information he anxiously sought \" No. How stupid you are, Cosmo, to-night 1\" \" Well, I am. It's my cold.\" \" I suppose it is Crown is off \u2014 I mean with the girl?\" \" Oh, yes, of course ; and \u2014 and\u2014 the other per sons are off, too.\" \" Well, you may call them off, if you like ; bat I should not exactly like their lodging.\" \" No, no 1\" The heart of Heron beat fast and thickly, as he longed to ask that woman what lodging it was she alluded to, aud who were the other persons of whom she spoke. Were they Elith and Tom Ripon? It was but too likely. He hazarded a direct inquiry. \" I don't think that boy,\" he t aal, \" is a likely person to put np with more than he can help?\" \" No ; he is a strange young scamp !\" This was a nice character of Tom Rip an \u2014 if it were Tom that was spoken of. \" And the\u2014 a\u2014 a\u2014 lady ?\" \" Sh3 says she is the Countess of Whitcombe, and I must confess she lou_* like a lady ; but she won't say who the Baron really is.\" Waere was Ejith. ? And where was Tom R;pon ? These were the two questions he wanted an swered in a colloquial _iis_.i_._-. Bat he almost decided to ask them in a more direct way, for fear the information was what, in his assumed character, he ought to know. \"Come now,\" suddenly saii the governess; \"if C own is as liberal as he ought to be for this affair I do not thick yon and 1 need wait!\" \"Wait?\" thought Heron; \"wait for what? What on earth does she mean?\" \" Ah !\" added the sham governess ; \" yoa don't reply to that ; aud I cannot help suspecting you wish, af.er all, to deceive me, or fly from vour word 1\" \" No ; believe me.\" What the word was that he was accused o! flying from, Captain Heron hud jiot the least notion. As long as be could, however, he made np his mind to keep up the delusioa which the woman had brought most certainly and most deservedly upon herself. \" Well,\" she adiied, \" wiea shall it be?\" \"\u25a0When you line\" \" You mean that ?\" CHAPTER OCVI. CAPTAIN HERON RESCUES EDITH AND TOM RIPON, AND PLACES A I'l.ba.lol'. IN THEIR STEAD. Felix Heron was anxious and willing to prolong this dialogue as far as he could, with the convic tion that eaoh moment of it gave him some valu able information. \" Of course I do.\" \" Then tell me exactly how much money you really aud truly have saved.\" \" A _ood sum.\" \"Indeed!\" He fully expected, however, that, should he emerge more into the faint light of the court, he would be discovered. \" Yes; a very good sum.\" \" Oh, you gay and charming rellow!\" \"Heml\" \"Aud so,\" he said, \" you are inclined to think that the lady is really the Countess of Whit combe?\" Felix Heron began to perceive the drift of all this; and that it was, alter all, a matrimonial epecu'ation that the pretended governess was thinking of. \" I, too,\" she said with a sigh, as she slid her arm wita an air of fond familiarity under Felix Heron's, \u2014 \" I, too, have been piudeutl\" \"You have?\" \" I am. You know I onght to be a tolerable jadge of such persons by this time.\" Captain Heron, of coarse, knew no such thing, but he felt that it was quite politic to say that he did. \" Ob, yes ; I am, as you say, well aware of that\" \" Tes ; 1 have money !\" \" I am delighted to hear it !\" \"I thought you would be; and here come3 Peter \" \" Of course, you are !\" \"And \u2014 ad \u2014 you think that, in a short time, the girl may be reconcile! to her fate?\" \" Oh, yes ; obstiuate as she is now, she will be like all the rest of them, pleased enough to make the best of matters when they see there is no help for it.\" \"No doubt! \u2014 no doubt! But do you think those two prisoners are ease?\" \"What two!\" \"The deuce 1\" \"Eh?\" \"Oh, nolhing! Did you say Peter was coming ?\" \"I did. Don't you see the glimmer of his lantern ? There he comes, up the seertt steps in the fountain that we know so well.\" Felix Heron was full of surprise and curiosity, for, as he now looked towards the old, decayed fouutain in the middle of the Cardinal's Court, be saw tbe fluttering gleams of some artificial light playing upon it. The light shifted about among the old stone figures and ornaments of the fountain, bringing them occasionally in broad relief, and making them assume all sorts of strange grotesque shapes. Heron wondered much who Peter was. He spoke more for the purpose of breaking a rather awkward, pause than that lehadanvthioK really to say. \" \u00b0 \" And so that is Peter?\" \" To be sure. Who else could it be ?\" \" The Countess, as she calls herself, and tbat troublesome imp of a boy !\" \" Ob, the young wretch ! I shall never forget him os long as 1 live 1\" Captain Heron was rather curious to know bow it was that Tom Ripon had succeeded in making so great an imprtsssion up. n the moek deaf and blind governess. \" Why what did he do?\" \" I am black and blae all through him. When his hands were tied, what do yon think he took to doing ?\" \"Kicking?\" \"Just so! If yoa had known him before, yon could not have guested au.ro truly.\""], [92, "86 EDITH HEHON. 1 degree of onriosity, but he felt quite confident he had never seen him before. The lantern sent a sufficient halo of light about it, to make the two figures in the arched doorway, faintly visible; and Peter \u2014 as the woman had named him \u2014 never doubting but what they were his accomplices, at once strode forward. \" All's right 1\" he said : \" they won't get out of that in a hurry !\" It wa3 under his Ie>f. arms, that Felix Heron held the woman a prisoner, so that his right was free. \" Oh, of course\u2014 of course !\" The light at and about tho old fountain each moment increased. Felix Heron kept his eye upon it, and as be did so, he clasped the arm of ths pretended governess tighter and tighter still beneath his own. \" Oh, how yon squeeze!\" \"Dol?\" \" You know yon do.\" \"lam afraid of Peter.\" \" Ot Peter ! Ho ! bo ! ho !\" \" Yon kn ow he might take you from m9, 6ince he is such an Adonis 1\" \"He? he? Oh, yon are joking ! Why, he is fifty if he is a day 1\" \"Is he'\" \" Is be, yes. ; and here he is.\" A g'eam of light, stronger than had yet shown itself, came from the very basin, as it appealed, of the- old fonntain. At tbe same moment, Felix Heron saw the out line of the figure of a man. There was no longer any time for procrastina tion, or farther amusement with the mistaken governess The hand of that right arm, as the man ap priached, was plungedinto the breast of his ap parel ; and by the time Peter actually got within a couple of yards of those in whom he expected to find companionship and commendation, he wai horrified to find that the gleam from his lantern fell upon the barrel of along suspicious-looking pistol, the muzzle of which was pointed in a direct line to his breast. \" Peter,\" said Felix Heron, \" if you have any desire to feel the hot and sickening sensation of a bullet in your heart or lungs, you will resist my orders ; if nit, yon will obey them, and save your life, worthless a3 it ii.\" Felix Heron cbsped her arm so tight beneath I'if, that her escape from him was impossible, snd he bent down his bead to her, as he said, \" Oae word, and I scatter your brains beneath the columns of this court! The slightest struggle \u2014 the slightest cry, and it is your last ! I am the Earl of Whitcombe !\" Peter stood aghast His mouth opened. His eyes dilated. The woman made a vigorous attempt to free herself from the left arm of Heron ; but, as he pressed and shook her to the ground, he said, almost fiercely, \" Not yet. I spare you, although I should not do so Beware ho w you rouse a feel ing iu my heart which is strap giing into existence and which will overwhelm you in destruction.\" With a faint shriek, the woman half fell, crouching down to his feet oa the pavement Toe moral ascendancy of Felix Heron over her was complete. These few little incidents happened with such rapidity that it seemed to the bewildered Peter as if, the moment he had appeared, some one had flown at him and grasped him by the throat \" Wretch !\" said Captain Heron, as he held him with a grip that threatened suffocation, \u2014 \" wretch 1 dispute with me, or contest in aDy way with me my will, and you rouse a spirit you cannot quell !\" Peter was by no means the sort of person to rouse any such spirit ; for cowardice was written legibly by the hand of Nature in ever? lineament of bis countenance. 6o completely taken I. y surprisa was tbe woman, that although, from the mere pain of the excessive pressure that Felix Heron subjected her arm to beneath his, she might well have cried out \u2014 not a wold escaped her lips. I; suited Captain Heron much better on the present occasion to snnouice himself by his own proper name than as the Baron Von P\u0153k ; for, disguised as the latter personage, ho u_i__A_. still be of service to Marianna. The pretended governess in a few seconds found her vo'c?, however. \"Gracious heaven! have I been deceived?\" \" Yes, and not the proper fate of all deceivers !\" \" Let me go \" \" No \u2014 I am firm and resolute ! Your life hangs npon the events of the next few sicunds! I know that you value it, and it depends upon yourself that you preserve it Be still and submit, or yon cust it away past recall.\" The tone in which Felix Heron uttered these words was one eminently calculated to have an effeot npon the nervous system of whoever might hear them. He submitted at once. Indeed, he put on such a look of faint and sickly degradation, that Captain H-rou's anger ran a good ohance of giving way to a feeling of utter contempt ; and, probably, he might have cast this man from him as utterly unworthy of regard, but for the certainty that from him or from the woman who oronohed at his feet, or probably from both, he should come at the secret of what hod become of Edi;h and of Tom Ripon. He felt the woman's arm tremble beneath his own. He felt that but for the support of that arm she wonld have fallen to the stone floor. The superiority of his own strong will over Its was manifested; and certainly so far as she was concerned he stood a conqueror. How far be might succeed in gaining a like ascendancy over Peter, who was approaching, re mained to be seen. The abject fear, however, that p\"_sessed these two people was just the kind of feeling to breed treachery Heron felt tbat they were not to be trusted for a single moment with tbe power of evil While holding the singular conversation we have recorded with the mock governess in the dark, Felix Heron had been able to make suffi cient ohaoges in his appearance aud apparel to destroy his identity as the Baron Von Pock. He had taken the wig from off his head which gave him an elderly appiaranee. That was a problem, however, which would be qniokly solved ; for with a slow and lounging t^ait, the man, who had e\u0153erged apparently from iii very basin of the fountain, came towards the arched doorway, where Felix Heron and she who may be called his prisoner were waiting. The man shaded tbe lantern he can id with one hand, so that its rays fell full upon his face. 0 ;\u2022! in Heron looked upon him with some"], [93, "87 EDITH HEROU, He had dashed away from his moustache some oi tho.9 wood ashes which had imparted the groy nes, of age. A tolerably hard rub with his handkerchief had likewise effaced some of those simulated hues upon the face, which had given him the appearance of a man past even the middle of life. And now Felix Heron completed the transfor mation from the Baron Von Peck to the E arl of Whitcombe in a manner that made the last change available for other purposes. He took oft the very voluminous neckcloth whioh he wore in his character as the Baron, and with it so firmly tied the right arm of Peter to the left arm of the governess, that if they ran at all it mutt certainly be in couplet, and that was to the great impediment of each other. They were perfectly passive in his hands. Downright fright deprived them of all power of resistance; and, to keep up this feeling in their minds, Captain Heron every now and then pointed the gleaming barrel of that pistol in their faces, &i though he were half repentiDg of his clemency, and much ioclined to scatter their brains in the Cardinal's Court CHAPTER CCVII. TOM REPON ASTONISHES PETER, AND EDITH BEACHES H011E IN SAFETY. The distance was short, and it was well that a time of night had arrived that rendered it impro bable any persons should be at the windows looking into that court of the old Palace of Hampton. At all events, Felix Heron thonght these a for tunate conjunction of circumstances \u2014 although, perhaps, mysterious proceedings in and about that portion of the Cardinal's ancient Palace were suffi ciently common to make those who were prudent enough to consult their own interests to shut their eyes to them. But, be this as it may, Felix Heron was right glad when the little party stepped over the margin of the old fountain. \" Here,\" said Peter, as, among the weed and rubbish which in process of time had o .llected in the basis of the basin, he pointed to a g a. ing cer tainly not three feet square- Heron was too eager to rescue Editl to wait for the tardy operations either of Peter or the mock governess, although they both, no doubt, knew well how to raise that grating. Stooping himself to it, he raised tho rusty bars of which it was composed, and found chat it turned over with ease npon a pair of binc.es. The light of Peter's lantern disclosed a flight of stone steps, the sides of which were thickly coated with green most. There could be no donbt bnt that the politic and wary Cardinal Wolsey, at the time he built the magnificent mansion of Hampton Court, was not unmindful of one very prevalent idea at that period. The idea of having places of concealment and modes of secret transit from one part of the Palace to another. When he did thi\u00bb, they made mute signs of horror and cons!ernation, for they were afraid to speak, unless he asked them a question. \" Now, Mr. Feter,\" said HeroD, \" since that is your name,, where did yon come from just now in so mysterious a manner, through the decayed fountain ?\" Peter gasped like a fish several times before he spoke. \" From\u2014 from the Cardinal's Kitchen.\" \" Where is that ?\" Peter pointed to the flag-stones of the court yard, as if to intimate that the Cardinal's Kitchen, to whioh he alluded, was somewhere beneath. Probably a look of impatience passed across the countenance of Felix Heron, for the woman spoke hastily. \" It is a vaulted room beneath this court, having one opening to the private garden, by an iron grating, and another into the basin of the old fountain.\" Peter seemed now desirous of taking the initi ative in the way of giving information, and he chimed in at once with the word. The well-contrived way from the fountain was doubtless one of them, and it would have been no very difficult matter even to the mechanical genius of the age in which Hampton Conrt Palace was built, to contrive some mode by which the basin of the fountain might hold water, and yet in a few moments be available as a secret mcde of exit from the principal dwelling-rooms of the building. \" Yes, sir, that is it ; and there, I think yon will fiad the two persons you want \u2014 the lady and the most horrid ruffian of a boy I ever met with.\" Or probably the wily Cardinal never had that fountain in working order, as it would have been by no means difficult to keep it constantly under repair. Felix Heron hesitated only a moment, and that was to consider wither he should descend first, or force Peter and the governess to do so. Hit impatience to reach Edith prevailed over all other considerations. Felix Heron had no doubt whatever but that he alluded to Edith and to Tom Ripon, although he could not conceive it possibl\" that Tom had al lowed himself to be made prisoner by suoh a per son as Peter. Nor had Tom done so, as we shall presently perceive. Felix Heron considered for a few seconds as to what he should do with his prisoners, and then he made up his mind that they should both ac company him to the Cardinal's Kitchen they men tioned. \"Show me this gloomy prison-home,\" he said; \" and, by yonr alacrity in doing so, show me that yoa wish to preserve your worthless lives.\" They almost tumbled over each other in their eagerness to precede him to the fountain in the court He descended first, but as he did so he held up the lantern, and darted at them a look which al most paralyzed them with fear. \"Follow!\" he said; \"or your blood be npon your own heads.\" It was by no means ar easy matter for two persons joked together as Peter ar>d the governess were to descend so narrow an opening and how they accomplished it was little short of miraculous. The body bends itself, however, to the supre maoy of strong passions ; and fear enabled them to do what otherwise they would have declared im possible They followed Heron. Heron counted sixteen stops until he arrived at"], [94, "EDITH HEP.0N. 88 \" No, no!\" cried Peter, in a paroxysm of rago ; \" I didn't say it !\" \" Yon know yon did!\" added Tom. \" It was only a joke, then\u2014 a little joke. I didn't mean it\" a vaulted passage beneath the pavement of the court Then he shouted out the name that was upper most upon his lips. \"Edith! Eiilh!\" There was au answering ory which shaped it self to the name of \" Felix !\" There were two answering cries; aud if there could have been any possible mistake about the first, there was none about the second. It was a ringing oheer from Tom Ripon. \"Hip\u2014 hip\u2014 hip! Hurrah!\" \" That's Tom !\" cried Oaptain Heron ; and dash ing forward, he shook violently a door which im peded his progress. A series of kicks upon the other side of the door, which were inflicted upon it with wonder ful rapidity, let Heron know that he was upon the right track. \" The key of this door at ouce !\" he shouted, as he hnrried to the trembling piisoners he had brought with him. Peter f. 11 on his knees immediately, and dragged the sham governess after him. \" Mercy I Have mercy upon na !\" \" The H., !\" \" It was a very bid joke, then,\" said Tom. \" Bat never mind, Captain ; on we go again. What are we to do next?\" \" Get out of this place as quiok'.y as we cm 1\" \" Tom, lead the way. You will see a flight of stairs.\" \" I hope I shall,\" said Tom ; \" for coming down them, nobody told me to look for them, and I only made one long step of it from top to bottom !\" \" How came you, Tom, to allow yourself to be made a prisoner by suoh a thing as this?\" asked Felix Heron, pointing to Peter. \" Why, Captain, that wasn't the thing at all. I was sit.ing down as comfortably as possible in the court-yard, pitching little stones into the fountain, jast to pass the time, when a wuat-do you-call-it all of a sudden took place \u2014 it's when the sun gets behind a cloud, or behind the moon, or behind a something \u2014 what is it, Lady Edith ?\" \" An eclipse, Tom.\" \" Yes, that's it ; and it came upon me in the shape of a bag that some fellow popped ovex me, and lied round my head and waist from behind before I could move hand or foot ; and that's how I came here.

In you go, both of you !\" Peter protested. The meek governess got up some faint screams. Tom Ripon, with very little ceremony, thrust them both into the vaulted chamber from which he and Edith had just emerged, and locked the door upon them. \" Come, Tom, come,\" cried Captain Heron. \" One moment, Captain.\" Tom dealt the door a vigorous kick or two, and shouted, \" Hallo !\" \" Yes, yes,\" faintly responded Peter from within.\" \"All right, Caps ain!\" The door was opened ; and in another moment Felix Heron forgot, not only his prisoners, but Tom Ripon likewise, as he clasped Ejith to his heart. \" Safe and well, Edith ?\" \" Both, Felix 1 What of Marianna ?\" \"Yes,\" cried Tom; \"what of the lovely Mari anna? A pretty thing it is for a fellow to be pushed into a black hole like this, just as a fellow had made up his mind to give up all the rest of the girls, and stick to that one for ever, aud a whole week after ! But I'll be off, and ferret her out, if she is above ground !\" Tom made a rush from the dungeon-like place he was iD, and not noticing the two kneeling figures of tbe sham govern^RH and Peter, he wpd t sprawling over tlem, to their great detriment and his own ntter aitonishment \" Are you hungry ?\" \" Yes, yes.\" \"Eat each either, then I No w, Oaptain, my mind's easy. Let's be off.\" Tom Ripon, no doubt, would have been quite unhappy if he had been denied the opportunity of retaliating upon the persons who had made such a speech that he had just repeated to him and to Edith. Tom Ripon had a habit of kicking whenever he got into a difficulty. He used to say it was Daisy who taught it him. Whether or no, he on this occasion liberally car ried it out, and the scuffle that ensued between him, and Peter, and the mock governess, would have been something ludicrous if Captain Heron had not been too seriously inclined to view it in that light \" Peace, Tom \u2014 peace I\" ha cried. \" Let us leave this place at once. The night is flying fast, and we have far to go.\" \"All right!\" said Tom. \" I didn't see the two images! BleES us and save ns! Why, they're live people, afler al! ; and one of them is a very old rascal, and told me and Lady Edith that if we happened to feel hungry in the night we might Bat Cap'ain Heron had his own opinion in re gard to the nature of the imprisonment that he was t_ ail appearance indicting upon the sham governess and her associate, Peter. They took the matter with by far too much ease and eq animity, for it to be serious. That they knew of some mode of speedily and tffectuolly releasing themselves, ho had no donbt That was a consideration that made it all the more necessary that he and Edith and Tom Ripon should get clear of Hampton Court as soon as passible.

Felix Heron opened the door of the stable-yard, and with, no doubt, a look of greit pride and satisfaction npon his countenanoe, if it could only have been seen in the darkness, Tim Ripon led forth a horse thoroughly equipped with a side saddle. \"There, Captain!\" said Tom; \"what do you think of that ?\" \" This is most fortunate, Tom,\" he said ; \" and f have no doubt this side-saddle has been for the special accommodation of that very unfeminine female whom we have left in what Pe;er called the ' Cardinal's Kitchen.' \" \" It will be all right, C-iptaiu,\" said Tom ; \u00ab yon and I must manage in the best way we can.

If any one is autho rizsd to borrow the King's fcorses to-night, I cer tainly consider myself that man.\" Captain Heron assisted Edith to mount, and then he and Tom quickly poes.ssed themselves of the other two horses. It was not an agreer.blo idea to ride fourteen miles to London without a saddle, but it had to be done, and in the cour_e of five minutes they had given the passwordand issued forth from Hampton Court in pars eot safety and security. \" Tom, I do not like to leave Edith for a single moment in this place,\" said Heron. \" Do you go, and get out, if you can, three horses.\" \" All right, Captain.\" Tom entered the stable, and Edith, with Felix, remained just within its doorway, or rather the doorway of the paved yard acros3 which the stable mi_ht be reached. \"Oh, Felix!\" whispered Edith; \"what is the fate of that poor girl, Marianna ?\" \" Let us hope for the beet, Edith; and that she will still be protected by heaven!\" \" Amen to that prayer, Felix.\" \" Come on, will you ?\" they heard the voice of Tom say. He was leading out some horse that, perhaps, was a li tie nn willing. At tbat moment the attentive ears of Edith c-ught tbe sound of advancing footsteps, some distance off, on the gravel path of the garden. \" Listen, Felix,\" she said ; \" do you hear noshing?\" The sounds were more pl.iin. There could be no doubt, too, of what they were. The measured tread was that of the guard, which, no doubt, was abont to be changed in and about, the old Palace. Edi h and Captain Heron retreated within the doorway, and Heron held the door close, so that it should still have the appearance of remaining fastened, in the event of any one being so over en picious or cautious as to think proper to try it As at present, a cavalry guard was always on duty at Hampton Court; and the dismounted troopers kept watch and ward at the various posts. CHAPTER CCVIII. FEUX HERON RESCUES ISARIANNA, AND HAKES ROYALTY PAY THE EXPANSES. It was a fortunate circumstance that one of those posts was not very close at hand to the .table s>.,7>c. so that there was no difficulty except to preserve silence while the gnard passed. \" We are fortunate,\" whispered Felix Heron ; \" for if we had issued forth but a few minutes earlier, we must have inevitably encountered the ralief guard.\" \" Let them pass again on their return,\" replied Edith. Felix Heron was anxioni to procure from E Tith a full aud detailed account of aU that had happened to her since he had left her with MsriaEna in the apartments allotted to him in his character of Baroa Von Peck at Hampton Court It was not, however, until they were in safety at Whitcombe House, and Tom Ripon had turned the, three horses adrift along Pall Mall, that Felix Heron felt inclined to ask any questions upon the .subject. What EHth had to tell was brief in the extreme. \" That is well thonght of. Tom, are you there ?\" \" Yes, Captain. All's right.\" \" Keep close with the horses ; we must not issue forth jet\" It was about ten minutes before the guard passed again that way with the sentinels who had been relieved from their posts. As they did so, the non-commissioned officer who led them spoke in anything but a cautious one of voi e \"Yon had hardly left the apartment three minutes,\" she said. \" when two persons appeared in it, coming from I know not where, although of course there must have been some secret panel or entrance in addition to that we already kaow of.\" \" Was one of those persons the King ?\" \" No ; the man Peter was one of them, and tho other a stranger.

You will all remem ber that no one is to be allowed to leave the pre cincts of the Palace except they use the words ' King's service I' \" As the Sergeant spoke, the guard passed on. Felix Heron smiled, os he whispered to Edith, \" We shall not be likely to forget so simple a pass word os tliat.\" \" No, Felix ; nor the simplicity of the man who has furnished m with it\" \" Indeed, not ; bat I am willing to believe it is one of those little ciroumstances that favour us, because we are battling for the right\" \" Now, Captain,\" laid Tom ; \" isn't it time to come out of this ?\" \" I think so.

Tbe King may still have faith in me as the Baron Von Peck, or he may suspect me, and be playing a double game. That, how ever, I will endeavour to understand ; for I will make my way to tho Palace as soon as twilight confounds a little the shadows, and lends me the assistance to my disguise whioh is so essential.\" Felix Heron thought it prudent to remain in Whitcombe House for the remainder of the day, and, indeed, he felt the necessity of rest after the many fatigues he had und;rgone. It was between seven and eight o'c'oek in the evening, that in his full costume of the Baron Vob Peck, and more carefully disguised thim ever, in order to represent that perionage, he macie his way to St. Jame;.'s Palace. It was quite possible the Kiog might not be there, for it wbs well known he had a fancy for passing with great rapidity from one to another of the three royal residences in London. St James's Pa'ace, Buckingham Honse, and Warwick House, or Warwick Lodge, as it was frequently called, were equally kept up as royal residences, although 6:. James's woethe proper official residence of the monarch and his Court. From one of the piges of the back-ttairs Felix Heron easily got the information of where the King was to be found. Warwick Lodge was the plaoe. It was bnt a short walk across the Park, aud F.-lix Heron made bis way through the somewhat fanciful iron gates of tbat then well-known resi dence of royalty, which has long since been swept away. \"Those are certainly tho words I used, my lord!\" \" It \u00bbeems to me that you wish Jo quarrel -I\" \" Not at all ; but I'm ready to do so, if neces sary, iH the service of his Majesty !\" \" But, I assure yon, Baron, his Majesty no longer desires yonr services, and, there the quarrel ends ; and, therefore, if you please, I will order one of pages to the show yon with all possible respec_ to the vestibule, whicli you need never cross again!\" \"From his Majesty's own lips I will accept my dismissal, but from none other.\" \"Impossible, Baron!\" \" And yet it must be so. Who shall deprive me of the pass given to me by his Majesty's own hand;, which admits me to his presence?\" \" But, Baron \" \" Not another word, sir. Here is one of the pages, to whose good care I commit myself. Bi pleated, sir, to conduct me to his Majesty's cabinet, and announca that the Baron Von Peck, on busi ness of importance, presents himself.\" \" I dare not, sir,\" was the pige's reply, as he adroitly backed through a narrow pair of folding doors, aad was about to close them, when ?elix Heron put his foot in tho entrance in such a manner that it was impossible to do so. \" I will take the responsibility upon myself,\" he said, \" of any blame that may attach to you.\" The page was timid, and made but a slight show of resistance; but Beeiog Lord ClacMngton, he ran out into the ante-chamber, caUing, as he did bo, in a voice of alarm, \"Guard \u2014 guard !\" Tke page was accustomed to the life at St James's, where the interior of the Palace was well 1* 'ked.to by the Yeomen of the Guard ; but in that private residence of the King, although a coop'e of sentinels held their po.-tn at the gates, there was nolhing of the strength and state of royalty within. Heron found no difficulty in penetrating to one of tie ante-ebambere, by virtue cf that written pass had from the King, and which he had oare tully preserved It wa. something of a mortification, howovar, to encounter Lord Clackington alone in that apart ment, and looking so smiling and contented, that he was quite a caricature of the courtier in fivour. Lord Clackington half-dretr hin eword, but he took care to keep the otter ba'f in the scabhard. Felix Heron cared little whoth-r he drew it wholly or not, but passing completely through tho narrow folding doore, be closed them beuind him, and shot into its socket a brass ornamental bolt which was beneath the lock. This self-satisfaction npon the countenunce of Lord Cluckingtao wai suggestive of bad fortune both to Felix Heron in his assumed character of Baron Von Peck, and to Marianna. The room was but a small one. On a table, with a large cover of crimson velvet edged with bullion, stood a hand lamp, and that was the only light in the apartment. Felix Heron, with the conviction on his mind that he was on the eve of eome adventure which would test perhaps all his resolution and all his oourage, lifted the lamp from the table, and casting his eye3 about him, perceived another pair of doors similar to those he had entered by, immediately opposite. The panels were richly gilt in high relief, and as Heron placed his hand u pon the lock, he fancied he heard a faint cry, but from what direction it proceeded he was at a loss to conjecture. It was more like SDtne wandering echo in and about the precinc's of Warwick Honee, than any cry from one of its apartments- Bat it made tha biood run cold about the haart of Felix Herom. But he resolved to put tbe bett face npon the matter that he could, aud however repugnant it might be to his general principles, he felt the ne cessity of meeting viilany and duplicity by finrsse. \" A fair morning, my lord,\" he laid. \" Is his Majesty stirring?\" Lord Clackiogton deliberately drew forth a gold ennff box before he replied, and regaled himself with a pinch of the then favourite snuff, which wont by the name of Macabaw. \" Yes, Baron, his Majesty is stirring \" \"Then,\" replied Felix Heron, scarcely able to restrain his i-n patience, for he hod an earnest desire to kick my Lord Clackingtou\u2014 \u25a0* then I shall have tho honour o'. piying my respeets to him.\" \" I think not, Baron.\" \"Indeed, my lord!\" \" I repeat, I think not. In fact I am rather inclined to state that hij Majesty will have no further occasion for the services of the Baron Von Feok.\" Without any particular aim or purpose about tho route he took, bat leaving himself to be guided either by instinct or by heaven, he strode on wards. \" Is tbat, my lorrl, a message from the King, er merely a little bit of private pique and malevolence \u2022od the part of my Lord Clackington?\" \"Pique \u2014 malevolence, Baron?\" Two apartments were passed through, the eoft carpeting of whioh felt l.ko untrodden snow beneath his feet"], [98, "92 EDITH HERON. With the butt- end of a pistol he struok three heavy blows upon the panel of the door that separated him from the Km_r and from Marianna. An exclamation of surprise came from the lips of the King. Marianna nttered a shriek of joy and hope- Any interruption of the terrible scenes in which she bore a part was welcome to her. Baog ! bang ! bang ! Heron struck three more blows en the panel. It was not etiquette for the KiDg to cry, \" Come in,\" had he been ever eo much inclined to do so. and ceiiainly be v-as not at all so inclined; but Marianna had no such scruples. \" Come in ! Come in I Whoever you are, come in, and save me!\" \"No!\" shouted the King. Heron opened the door, and slowly 6talk;d into the apartment The King retreated backward until he could get no further. The wall stopped him, and then he paused, with such an expression oi fright upon his face, that Heron saw resistance was quite out of the question. Then Felix Heron pau.ed abruptly, for most unmistakably he heard a voice which he knew well. It was the voioe of the King. \"Pooh, pooh, girl! You know not what you say ! This is all childish nonsense. The prefer ment that I offer you is such that there is not another person in all these dominions who would not shout for joy at the chauce of accepting. As soon as you are of age, letters p-vent shall pass the great seal, making you a peeress ia jour own right; and that, with an adequate allowance from the privy purse, places you in a posit on far be yond anything you have a right to expect\" The reply was iu the voice of Marianna. That voice thriibd through the nervous system of Feiix Heron like a shot of electricity. \"No, no!\" she half-nhiieked; \"I reject all \u2014 I despise aU ! There is but one now whom I can love in this world, for my dearest affections are with the dead. Be great, and just, and merciful; and let me reside with that Countess of Whit combe who, although I have seen but once, I feel that I can love for ever !\" The looks of gratitude aud joy which poor Marianna bent npon Felix Heron required to be seen to be appreciated. No words oonld, in any degree, do justice to them.

The only words she uttered were, \" I knew that yon would come 1\" \" And you know me?\" whispered Heron. \" At once I\" \" Why, the girl's mad !\u2014 the fol'ow's dead !\" \" Dead I\" screamed Marianna. \" Have you silled him ?\" \" Killed him ? I ? Not I ! But he has .ne* with his de.erts. as a highwayman. Do you not. know that this Earl of Whitcombe you speak of took to the road, and became a well-known high wayman, by the name of Captain Heron ? He was shot some time ago, near Edgeware. How did you ever become acquainted with him, brought up, as you have been, in strict seclusion and privacy ?\" \"List night.\" \" Last what ?\" The perception of the young girl, that this masked figure in the scarlet coat was, indeed and ia truth, that same Felix Heron, the Earl of Whit combe, who had been so true a friend to her at Hampton Court, was too strong on tbe mind of Marianna to be questioned for a moment Bat Felix Heron felt that he had to arrange matters with the King, whose first fright might soon pass away, and then the situation would be one of some peril. And, in fact, this seemed to be exactly the case, for the King hastily approached a bell-rope that hung close to one of the windows of the room, and grasped it with a nervous clutch. \" Holdl\" cried Heron. \" On your life, hold !\" As he spoke, he presented that same long, bright-barrelled pistol which had bred t>uch con sternation iu the mind of Peter at Hampton Court, full at the bead of the King. Tbe royal countenance blanched with fear. The bell-cord was dropped. \" Tbat is well,\" said Heron ; \"and row, yonr Majesty, I have but two requests to mate to you.\" \"Slop!\" Felix Heron pumru. \" Yen live I Yon are no ghost 1\" \"Beware!\" \" Last night I Eaw him.\" \" You dream, girl \u2014 yoa dream; or some impostor hat imposed upon you.\" \" Ns, no I I saw him ; he took me by the hand, and promised to aid and save me. I have faith ia him that he will do so still. I do not think that even these walls and all these doors, and even all the guards and attendants that can surround yoar Majesty, will keep him from me.\" Before Maiianna lid begun to utter these last wordt, Captain Heion had made up his mind what course lo adopt No longer as the Baron Von Peok wonld ho present himself before the King, but in his more proper character of Felix Heron, the highwayman of Epping Forest , The ceat that he wore was that whioh he had to meet emergencies of this charaoter. He had but to slip it off and reverse it, when it presented the bright scarlet horseman's surtoat which assimilated well with his character of a knight of the road. \" No, no ! Tell me only that yon are a living man, and I will forgive and forget\" \" Can she forgive and forget ?\" Heron, as he spoke, pointed to the girl, who clung to him with such a confiding energy, as ber only support and hope. The King was silenced. \" I demand of your Majesty that jewel easket \"Oh, no, no!\" cried Marianna. \"He tried to make me think that those jewels were worth The wig of the Baron Von Peck was dispensed With in an instant. A slight alteration in the bat he wore, and the addition of a half crape mask, whioh only left the moustaohe, the mouth, and tho ohin visible, made up altogether a complete charge in the peison and appearauco of Captain Heron"], [99, "93 EDITH HERON. honour\u2014 virtue \u2014 all tae world 1 Do not take them \u2022\" The King crossed the room, and entered another, the window of whioh looked into the garden of Warwick House, and from whioh window down to the garden there was acoess by s flight of stone steps. '\u2022 Go,\" said the King. \" Yonr way liet plainly before you. Here is a key to the private gate of the garden. I only ask one thing.\" \" What is that ?\" \"They will no lotper corrupt anyone row,\" mid Heron, as be lifted a ca- 'et that was upon th* table, and coolly put it iu his pocket The King looked aghast \" And now, your Majesty,\" added Heron, \" I make no doubt but there is some mode of egress from this place different from that I have entered by.\" Tho King was silent. Alook of dogg.d, stolid obrioace settled upon his face. \" I iuaist npon an answer,\" said Heron Heron strodo up to him, end placed the cold threatening muzzle of the pistol to his ear. \" Once\u2014 twice \" \" Simply that all the proceedings of this night shall be buried iu oblivion.\" Heron was silent. He looked at Marianna. \"Oh, yes! yes'\" \" Then be it so. The proper person has replied to tbat question, and so, yonr Majesty, good night; and may tbe next adventure in which you engage your royal leisure be a something more worthy of a king\" No answer was returned to this biling reproof ; and as Captain Heron no longer entertained a doubt but that he really aud truly saw the wiy before him to leave Warwick Hoase, he took Mari anna by the hand, and led her at once down the flight of steps. The King then called after him, and ia rather an undignified tone of voice. \" Cast the key,\" he said, \"over the garden wall. One of our house hold will find it\" \" Hold!\" \" It is twice. If I tay thrice, I fire!\" \" Take this key.\" Th\u00bb King handed to Felix Heron a gilt key. \" Take this key. You will see a key-hole that it will just fit dose to the frame of yonder mirror.\" \" That will suffice.\" Heron opened a long door, that brought the whole of the mirror with it, and disclosed beyond it a black aud dismal opening. To this Heron made no reply, for he intended to do no such thing ; arid thus wa,.. it that neither of those observations mad. by either of these parties met with any direct answer from the other. CHAPTER CCK. CAFTAIN HFRON REVISITS BIS OLD HAUNT AT __.FFI.NO FOREST AND MtETS WITH A SURPRISE. The K k '. uttered a cry. He v_ on the point of escaping from the room when Felix Heron darted after him, and caught him just in time by the skirt of his coat. \" Not bo fast !\" The garden of Warwick Honre in that direction was but of limited extent; and as Felix Heron felt the necessity of leaving the precincts of the royal residence at quickly as possible, he hurried Mari anna with him. \" Treason \u2014 treason !\" For once in a way the King had spoken the truth, and the key he had banded to Heron did its duly at the little gate which was the private en trance to the garden. Far from cssting the key over the garden sgaii, as he had been particularly requested to do, Heron put it cautiously into his pocket for future service. L >rd ClackiuRtou pa\"; his bead in at tha door of the room, and Felix Heron at once flung at it the casket of j-wels. The crack that the c_.k>t cemo againsi Lord Clackingtou's head was alarming to hear, and the casket itself fl-w open, scattering its bright and glittering contents en tbe floor. Then Felix Hir.-n grasped the King bj- the arm ns he spoke iu a tone the sincerity of which could not be doubted. There was a narrow pathway by the side of Warwick House that led towards the western end of Pall Mall; and as Felix Heron with rapid footsteps conducted Marianna along it, he congra tulated her upon her escape. \" You will be safe now, at least for a time,\" he said, \" with the Countess of Wr.itcombe; and it may be that you may be so altogether for an un limited period. And at all events, if danger should threaten from any quarter, we shall probably have sufficient notice of it to guard against it, or to fly at its approach \" \" Can it be possible,\" said Marianna, \" tbat after all, I should be so happy as to rtside with the Countess of Whitcombe ?\" \" Ie it worth while to cast away a life and a crown for this folly ? I must and will escape, and carry with me this young girl, wham you weald have betrayed to destruction.\" \"You shall.\" The King was thoroughly alarmed. '\u2022You shall \u2014 I promise it.\" \" Then speak aloud, and dismiss yon meddling fool.\" \" Meddling\u2014 fool ! Who ? \" \" Olackington.\" \u00ab Oh 1 \" The King called out aloud \u2014 \" Tell my Lord Claokington not to interfere with what does not conoern him.\" A confused murmuring noise wa* heard in the next apartment, and then a door was closed. \"Not that way,\" added tho King, as he pointed into the black space behind the mirror, which had been disclosed by the agenoy of the gilt key. \"Not there. It has no outlet\" \" I surmised at much.\" \" Wo will hope so ; and I feel assured she will be equally pleased to have you at an inmate.\" Felix Heron began to feel quite conscious that Marianna wat suffering greatly from fatigue. He conld hear that it was quite with an effort she spoke, and she was compelled to lean almost her entire weight upon his protecting arm. Marianna was like many persons with cou rageous impulses. She was able to support her self well while the excitement of tbe events that made a call on her energies lasted, but when that was over her strength forsook her, and she wag scsticely able to feel that she existe. . \" Follow me.\" Heron hastily picked np the casket, and thrust back into it all bat two or three of the jewels."], [100, "94 EDITH HERON. in such deep gloom that half-a-dozen persons might there with ease have ensconced themselves, and mingling with the black shadows cast by some massive columns supporting a heavy portico, completely eicape observation. Heron, then, without the slightest hesitation, walkei towards the doorstep of Whitcomba House. The distance however, was very short to Whit oombe House. And yet how full of risks it was to Felix Heron ! He had to cross St James's Street at a tolerably early hour of the evening\u2014 not in the disguise of the Baron Von Peck, which gave him a certain assurance of safety, but in his own proper person, and as nearly as he could assimilate himself to it , in the costume of Heron, the highwayman of Epping Forest- Five minutes, however, would place him npon the doorstep of Whitcombe House. Surely no evil destiny would pursue him for that short space of time, and bring an atmosphere of danger about him. \" Courage, courage, Marianna,\" he cried. \" We shall be at home in a few brief seconds.\" As he did so he spoke to himself in the faintest possible whisper, saying, \" If that is not Jonathan Wild spying into the gate of the mansion, it is his ghost!\" Bat it was Jonathan Wild himself. Quietly and noiselessly, Felix Heron stood on the step immediately behind him. Wild was stooping low, so that his back was completely at right angles with the door, and he was to intently engaged with looking into the hall at Whitcombe House, that if Felix Heron had made much more noise than he did, it is doubtful if he would have been heard. \" I am faint and weak.\" \" I know \u2014 I feel you are; but let the tame spirit that hat hitherto supported you hold you up still. In the hall of Whitcombe Home you are safe.\" \" Oh, yes, quite safe 1\" \" There, lean upon me : yon see yonr weight is nothing, and your feet need do little more than merely tonoh the ground.\" Felix Heron had his head bent down towards Marianna as he speke, bnt when he looked up si.ge.m he staggered back as if her light weight had been loo much for him. \"I can't make it out,\" muttered Jonathan. \"Theio is something mysterious here still, and I am de ceived in some way. I can't make it out at al!, but I shall, or I will know the reaton why.\" Jonathan Wild drew a long breath as he straightened himself up, and faced about By that movem nt he wts to close to Felix Heron, so absolutely faoe to face with him \u2014 for Heron had taken off the half crape mask, and held it in his hand \u2014 that Wild saw into his very eyes. In the dusky twilight of the rapidly approaching night he saw dimly a figure upon the doorstep of Whitcombe House, and from its attitude there could not be a moment's doubt that it was some one trying to make observations in the hall by peeping through the key-hole of the outer door. The darkness of the evening was too far advanced, and the distance, short as it was, was yet too great, for Heron by ocular demonstration to convince himself of the identity of this person. And it was not at this time that brilliant gas lighted the streets, but miserable oil lamps, which were sure to be blown out by a gust of wind, or, as was more frequently the case, extinguished pur posely by the depredators of the night, in order to carry on more securely their deeds of darkness. Such, indeed, was tho case on the evening of which we are writing : the oil lamps, few and far between, and some of them extinguished, left Whi .combe House in deep sbado ;v. It was rather, then, a perception on the part of Felix Heron that he knew this person, than any evidence from his own eyesight of the fact. He paused and spoke to the young girl softly, who hung upon his arm. \" Marianna 1\" There could be no doubt of his identity. It was not that which caused the look of terror which spread itself over the face of Jonathan Wild. It was of the mortality of Felix Heron that he doubted ; for one of the few things that Jonathan Wild balieved in was death; and that Felix Heron was no more was to hit mind a truth so firmly impretsed upon his understanding, that the sight of him then and there before him, apparently as a being of flesh and blood, could not be eradicated. If it were indeed an apparition that he looked upon, its close proximity to him was anything but pleasant \" Beware 1\" said Heron, iu a deep, solemn voice. That was enough for Wild. Mortal man he feared not, but a being of another world, armed with unknown powers, and invested with unknown terrors, was too much for his organization. He bent down his head, and dashed off the door-step. As Heron stepped adroitly aside, it was Jona than V, ild's full impression he had gone right throngh the supposed apparition. Felix Heron could not imagine what Wild's ob ject could be in tarniag neither to the light nor to the left, ia each of whioh directions the pavement was perfectly clear ; but it seemed as if a straight forward course over the roadway of St. James's Street was the only thing that suited him. A sedan- chair was passing at the moment, end Jonathan Wild, as if for some great wager he was to keep a straight line, despite all obstacles, ac tually scrambled over the roof of it, to the great dis-nay of its bearers aad a pauenger who was in it \" Yeo \u2014 oh, yes! What wonld you say ?\" \" Do not be alarmed \u2014 but it is neoetsary that for a few .seconds you should conceal yourself in this doorway, whioh, you perceive, is only a short re move from Whitcombe House.\" \" There is danger, then I We are pursued 1\" \" Not so ! But there stands a person on the doorstep of Whitcombe House who may or may not be a foe to you, but who certainly has been a bitter one to me I\" \"Yes! yes I I will do anything yon wish 1 It is for my sake yon run all these riskt, and that the very air you breathe is lull of peril !\" \"Not so! \u2014 not bo I All will be well ! Speak to no one \u2014 remove not from this spot on any per suasion until I return to you 1\" The doorway into whioh Felix Heron con ducted Marianna was one of a house about fifty paces distant from Whitcombe mansion. It was Felix Heron had ample time to make his way to the deep doorway where he had left Marianna; and before Wild had dicenoumbered himself of the entanglement of the sedan-chair, he had flung his arm about her waist, and fairly oarried her into he hall of Whitcombe Home, the door of which"], [101, "EDITH HERON. 95 he opened with a key whioh he always had in his possession. If Heron then had been in a position to watch Jonathan Wild, he would have found a clue to the mystery <f that headlong progress. Jonathan had taken possession of the old cham bers belonging to Lord Warringdale immediately oppotite to Whitcombe Honoe. Believing that he had disposed of Lord War ringdale at the bottom of the Thames, Wild had thought it as well that he should have a Wett-end V lac j of abode ; and p'.oking the lock of the cham bers, he had quietly taken possession of them, along with aU the good* and chattels of Loid War ringdale. Felix Heron thought he was alone in the hall of his house with Marianna, bnt an exclamation from her made him aware of the fact that Tom Ripon was fast asleep in an arm-chair. \"Tom, Tom!\" cried Heron. \"Look alive! Jonathan Wild has been upon the doorstep !\" Tom Ripon sprung to his feet \"The deuce he has, Captain! Oh, there she is ! \u2014 there she is ! I give them all np from this moment 1\" \" Go, F^lix,\" she said, \" but take Ogle with you.\" \" Nay, rather let me leave him here, as your protector in my absenoe. Tom Ripon will ac oompany me; he is well mounted, fearless, aad agile as a squirrel. The distance, after all, is bat short, and we shall be back by the dawn.\" Edith was fain to consent; and after agiia assuming his full disguise, as the Baron Von Peck, Heron started from the stable entrance of Whit combe House, mounted on Daisy, and accompanied by Tom, who was quite delighted at the enterprise. It was a great ohject with Heron to get out of London as toen as possible, and he put Daisy to such speed that it was rather difficult for Tom'ci horse even with his light weight to keep np with him. When once, however, fairly on a good country road, Captain Heron let Tom come up to him, aud restrained Daisy to a considerably ei'ier trot \" Oaptain,\" said Tom, \" it's one cf the fairest nights for us that ewr I saw or expect to see.\" \"For us, Tom? What do yon mean?\" \" Why, of course, Oaptain, I mean for onr little affairs on the road.\" \"What do yon mean? Are von atleep, or mad ?\" \" But you don's suppose that I am out en any such expedilion, do yon?\" \"Not out? And Daisy tool Oh, won't she be just a little disappointed!\" Heron laughed. \" No, Tom, I am bound for Epping Forest, to ree if some gold that I hid in its depths is still to bo fonnd there.\" \" Neither, Oaptain ; bnt when a fellow has eyes in his head, and seas Venus and all the Graces, aged sixteen, what's he to do?\" \" He is not to fall asleep in the hall, under pre tence that he is waiting for his master,\" replied Heron.\" Tom was rather, as he explained it to Ogle when relating the circumstance to him, taken \"a-baok\" by this speech; and before he recovered, Felix Heron had eecored Marianna to that well known green drawing room where Edith was anxiously expecting his return. There was joy in that little household on that night ; and if Edith could but have prevailed upon Ooptain Heron to forsake, at once and for ever, Ixv. perilous adventures on the road, she would scaioe have had a wish unfulfilled npon eaith. Heron sighed deeply. \" It is my fate,\" he said. \" You know well, Edith, what exertions I have made to as.umothe position that in truth belongs to me.\" \" Yes ; bat, as tbe Barcn Von Peck, surely yon may be a constant and a safe visitor here to me as the supposed widowed CountetB of Whitcombe.\" \" I ecarcely know how long that would last, but there is one expedition upon which I wish to start as early as may be.\" \"Ah! what is that?\" \" Well, Capt'-in, that comes to much the same thing; but you don't miud me doing a little ia the stand and deliver line on (he road, do you ?\" \" On the way back, Tom, bat not now.\" CHAPTER CCX. CAPTAIS HEKON AND TOM RIPON FIND EPFISO FOREST IN THB OCCUPATION OF OLD ENEMIES. Tom Bipon was rather dull alter this half-aud half sort of permission to play the part of a high wayman, that Captain Heron had given him. The last thing, however, that would ever have struck the miud of Tom Ripon would be to dispute any positive orders of Herou. They rode on, therefore, for some mile3 in silence, and it was not until the old trees on the outskirt,; of the forest became visible that Tom again spoke cheerfully. \" Ah, Captain, '.here's the old orib I\" \" Yes, Tom, bat it is sadly deserted now.\" \" I almost wish we were b.ick to it, Captain.\" Perhaps at the bottom of his heart there lit gered a wish that was very near akin indeed to that whioh Tom had just given utterance to. Both ht and hit faithful follower tsere, however, soon diverted frem ail other thoughts aud con siderations by a circumstance that struck them a_> decidedly singular. They had believed Epping Forest to be en tirely deserted, bnt such was evidently not the cose. \"It is unattended with danger, and I hope will be profitable- In one of the deepest recesses of old Epping Forest I have hidden some gold, and it is far better in onr possession than that it should remain to test the chances of time, and fall into the hands of strangere.\" \" Deep in the forest?\" \" Nay, Edith, look not soared at a visit to those green old haunts where we have passed some happy days. The owl, the bat, and the timid hare alcne inhabit the darksome recesses of our beau tiful and sylvan home.\" Edith sighed. Afeeling of unknown peril took possession of ber, and she would fain have cried to him, \" Go not forth to night.\" She saw, however, that he was bent npon the enterprise, and she would rather he went with her prayers to accompany him, than detain him until perhaps some more unpropitious time. A low, clear whistle eonnded among the _,-_.! dump of trees on itt outskirts. This whistle was followed by a hooting noise, very similar to that which used to be the private signal at the time that Heron and his band occu pied the recesses of the verdant and picturesque wood"], [102, "96 EDITH HERON. Daisy pricked up ber ears, as though she, too, recognised the old well-known sounds- Tom Ripon looked astonished. \" Why, Captain, what does all that mean ?\" \" I r-annot imagine, Tom.\" \" Wo don't hold the forest now I\" \"Hilloa, friend!\" he said, \"you are late in the old wood!\" \" I have lost my way,\" replied Heron. \" Ob, indeed ; and who may yon be ?\" \" A gentleman !\" \"Hem! Well, so am I. I suppose you want to find the nearest route out of the wood ?\" \"Hush!\" \"To-whoo! to-whoo! Whoot! whoot !\" * I do.\" The cries came clearly npon the night air, tchoiDg from glade to glade. It was auite clear tbat Epping Forest was not iti the lonely aud deserted condition that Felix Heron thought it. He piusee! ,o consider what course it would be _3n^t advisable to pursue. \" Tom \" he said, \" I think I w'H not risk any thing in tbe wood to-night!\" \u2022\u25a0 Ho w do you mean, Captain ?\" \" I mean that I will take caro of you and of D dsy, as the two most valuable things I have with me!\" \" Yon have only to follow me then, and I will soon show it to you.\" \" I am much obliged- Pray lead tbe way.\" \u2022F.Hx Heron, whose real name and identity were effectually concealed by his disguise t.s the Baron Von Peck, heard John Tarleton laugh to himself, as he preceded him towards one of the forest glades, that was perfectly well known to him, Heron. \" Do you live iu the wood ?\" asked Herer. \"Sometimes\u2014 just for a change, yoa see.\" \"A rough life, and I should almost think a hazardous one, from what I have heard.\" \" W_at have you heard ?\" \" Why, that Epping Forest was the br.tint of a baud of robbers, at the head of which was one C.ptain Felix Heron.\" \"Ha, ha! Tom looked both pleased and alsrmad. He had no objection to be classud wilh Daisy, as of similar vilua, bat he dreaded beiug left behind while Felix Heron sought adventures in the old forest \" I hope you don't mean, Captain, that I am not ti go with you into the wood ?\" \" 'Tow can yoa tako care of Daisy, if yon Co?\" \" You laugh at that?\" \" I do. Perhaps you will in good time find ont why I laugh at it Come on, my good tir. This is the way, if yoa please. You are quits fortu nate in having met with me iu the forest, as otherwise you might have come across some bad characters. Tom was silent. \" Arid how can Daisy take care of you?\" \" Well, Captain, I suppose it can't be helped \" \" AU is for tho best, Tom. I have with me my silver whittle. You will omprehend that, if you hear three loud calls on ir, you are to make your way with Daisy to that part of the wood where the large old sycamore tree waa one night struck by li(;hiuing. \" I know it, Capfa'n.\" \" Be wary, then, aud vigilant.\" \"AH's right. I will keep close. Tlicra is a \u25a0capital cover here, by those nut-bushes th.v. have grown up wonderfully tince I last bb.'J' them.\" Captain Heron dismounted, and handed the bridle of Daisy to Tom Ripon. On foot, then, with a cautious step, bu* with his hand npon the hilt of his sword, he made his way into the wood. Again the hooting noise ec'joetl from copse to gla'ie. Heron fanoied thst he was seen- \"Indeed!\" \" Oh, yes ; tho whole wood is alive with suoh desperad es, I assure you.\" By this time they had reached the glade, which by she route they took it was evident to Felix Heron they were approaching. The quiet, easy manner of Heron had impressed upon the mind of John Tarleton that he had lit upon some very easy prey. \" Now see,\" he said, \" if yon look to the riglat, to far as you can be expected to do so in this darkness, I shall bo able to point out to yon exactly the route you should take to get clear of the forest.\" \" I am infinitely obliged to you,\" said Heron. The moment he spoke John Tarleton laid the lantern he carried on the ground, and pUciog his hands to his lipt he executed what co doubt Tom Ripon, who was an adept in such matters, would have declared to be an exceedingly clumsy adapta tion of the hooting of an owl. Felix Heron stood pe' fectly calm and composed, but he kept upon his guard, and looked warily about him. That circumstance, however, dii not in any way discourage him, and he walked on ontil he s.iva light moving among the trees. The light evidently approached him. \" Hilloa I\" cried a voice. \" Who is there ?\" asked Heron. It was quite evident, from what followed, that though he, Heron, had deserted Epping Forest, and co longer held it with that band bo devoted to his service, other pertens had taken possession of it, and were quite prepared to carry ont a similar career to that whioh had characterized Captain Heron. \" Hoy !\" Heron stood still, and tbe parson who bore the light, and who had called out to him, came for ward among the bashes. Herco oould see but little of him, except that he was a man about the middle height, and that the light he ca:iia4 consisted of a lantern at the end of a short stick or pole. He to held the kntern that ha was vert mach cast into shadow Limself. From the bushes and thick growing trees on each side of that forest glade there issued forth about a dozen desperate looking men, who, cot without some skill and strategy, took up various positions, so that any attempt to escape on the part of the supposed itrange gentleman who had lost his way in the wood was tolerably well pro vided against. \"Now, sir,\" said John Tarleton, altering his tone, and assuming one of brutal ferocity, \" wo are desperate men, and the leis you gay to us is the Bat Heron had _ suspicion that he knew him, and that it was nans other than that John Tar leton, the bid brother of Edith, whom he bad onoe sworn to kill, but had allowed yet to live for tier sake. When this man wilh tho lantern spoke again Felix Heron felt nite certain of hit identity."], [103, "97 EDITH HERON. soonest mended. We want your money, watch, jewellery, and, in fact, anything that is worth taking yon may happen to have about yon.\" \" Then you are thieves,\" laid Heron, quietly. . Call ns what you will ; we won't quarrel about terms, bnt hand over the booty\" \" To your leader, probably, I may.\" \" I am the leader.\" It was Lord Warringdale, who, notwithstanding all the dangers he had gone through, and the ferociont attempt that had been made upon bis life by Jonathan Wild, still existed, and had taken up his abode in the forest ot a last resource from the many dangers, both legal and personal, that as sailed him. I I \" The Captain ! \u2014 the Captain !\" wat now the general cry, and it wat evident that the lawless men in that dense and shadowy wood looked upon Warringdale as tbeir leader. A strange feeling came over the mind of Felix Heron. \" Oh, no ! I am quite snre the captain of so re spectable an assemblage wonld never himself he prowling about, as a scout, with a lantern.\" The thieves who had so hastily collected about Felix Heron in the Forest laughed at this observa tion, and one of their number called out, in a voice of ferocity, \" Put a bullet into him, and have done with it at once.\" More than once, twice \u2014 ay, even more than thrice, he had spared Lord Warringdale, and made him a present so to speak, of his life. Tbe question that Heron asked himself wat this. \"Hold, there!\" cried a voice, as a tall man emerged from among the bushes. \" What is all this ? and whom have you here a prisoner?\" Heron too well knew that voice. Was there a sufficient feeling of humanity shame, or gratitude in the heart of that bad man Edith \u2014 No. 65."], [104, "98 EDITH HERON. yet again, when yon will bitterly repent this aot\" which wonld induce him to act similarly to him, Heron ? It wat not that Heron actually felt that his life was in the hands of his half-brother; but, no doubt, under the present circumstances, Lord Wat ringdale would be inclined to think such was reaUy the case. Upon tbat thought Heron wanted to test him. He still kept up the assumed voice in which he had spoken from the fi st ; and, with the same calmness of demeanour which had characterize him throughout, he said, \" I may as well state now, at once, that my presence here is not acci dental. I have sought Epping Forest for a special purpose, and it is to make an important communi cation to your leader in regard to a certain earl dom and its contingent properties and estates !\" Lord Warringdale uttered an exclamation. Such a communication could only be addressed to him of to Felix Heron ; and he, in common with all the world, was impressed with the idea that Heron was no more. Heron was so well acquainted with Epping Forest, in all its intricacies, that it was much the same to him by night as by day A few minnteg sufficed to take him qnite clear of all danger and all pursuit Then he paused, and asked himself if he should still carry out, or not, his projected search for tho gold he had hidden about the ruins of the old Priory. \" No,\" he said. \" There let it still abide. If the time should come when any one dear to me requires it, still I shall have the power to seek it\" A glance about him at the well-known trees en abled Felix Heron to know in what direction to go in search of Tom Ripon and Daisy. In five minutes he had rejoiced them \"Come, Tom,\" he said \"I have seen and heard quite enough in Epping Forest for to night.\" \" And I too much, Captain,\" said Tom. \" What, then, have yon seen?\" \" I hardly know what to call it ; bnt the old wood is pretty well surrounded by men, who, if they are not ' Robins,' I am not Tom Ripon.\" A \" Robin \" was a familiar term frequently nsed to signify police-officers, on account of the red waistcoats they a'l at that time wore. \" Constables, Tom ?\" \" Yet, Captain.\" \" Who leads them ?\" \" Speak,\" he cried, \" and speak truly. What is it yon have to say to me ? \u2014 for I, of all here pre sent, am the only person interested in such a sub ject\" \" Is it your pleasure that I speak aloud what I have to say,\" added Heron, \" or will yon receive it yourtelf alone?\" Lord Warringdale hesitated a moment, for he was constitutionally cowardly; and even in the depths of Epping Forest, with a band of despe radoes aboHt him willing to do his behests, he wat still full of fears. \" I don't know ; bnt I do know that it is not Jonathan Wild.\" \" Then let ns be off as qnickly as we can, Tom, fer thit is no place for ns.\" Felix Heron mounted Daily, and at a trot he and Tom Ripon left the forest It wat not until they got about five miles on ihe road to London that Heron pulled up, on hearing the clear, lond notes of a horn on the night air. \" A mail coach, Tom,\" he cried. \"Ah! yes, Captain. Oh, dear me!\" \"What's the matter?\" The reflection of a few moments, however, was sufficient to convince him that no man in his senses wonld attack him with tbe slightest prospect of escape, and his death was not so important a matter to any one that they wonld sacrifice their own lives to compass it. He stepped aside with Felix Heron. \" Now, sir,\" he said, \" what is it yon have to say of the Earldom of Whitcombe, for it is that yon cane to speak about?\" \" I have simply to ask yon,\" said Heron, at once atiuming his natural voice, \" if you know me ?\" Surprise and consternation kept Lord Warring dale silent for a short time. \" Not much, Captain ; bun I feel rather bad. Don't you think you could rid eon and wait for a fellow at the next mile-stone ?\" The course he then adopted was at once startling and unexpected to Heron. \" Fire, all of you,\" he shouted, \" and heed me not!\" \"What for?\" \" The coach. Stand and deliver! Your money or your life 1 That's the dodge I\" Heron laughed \" You a-e too late, Tom ! You are too late !\" Felix Heron and Tom Bipon had only just time to draw aside on the road, as a horseman, olosely followed by another one, came at a gallop past them. Simultaneously with the utterance of theie words, he suffered himself to drop completely to the green sward of the forest glade, so that the rattling dis charge of pistol shots that immediately succeeded brought no danger to him. Captain Heron, however, was a fair target, and at that moment he ran a greater risk of his life probably than he had ever ran before One bullet strnck him on the shoulder. That bit of the road happened to be extra ordinarily light, for an opening in the night olouds sent down a good strong moonlight reflection, and by that light Heron saw, to his great surprise, that the two horsemen were fa'ly equipped as perfeot highwaymen. Another grazed hit neck. Neither could be said to have absolutely wounded him, so tlight in truth were the injuries they pro duced, but it was a great risk, for all that And so sudden and bo totally unexpected wat the action on the part of Lord Warringdale, that Heron, for once in his life, was sufficiently taken by surprise to be irresolute. The sound of fire-arms, however broke the tpeii which the sudden aot of treachery on the part of Warringdale had oait about Heron. With one leap he cleared the oronching form of hit half-brother. They were well mounted, too, and went past him and Tom Ripon at a good speed. \" Hilloa, Captain !\" cried Tom, as toon as theie two men had galloped on so far as to be well ont of earshot, \u2014 \"hilloa, Oaptain! Who may they be?\" \" I cannot imagine, Tom !\" \" Gentlemen in onr line, Captain ?\" \" I must and will asoertain who they are ! Yon trot on gently by the road, Tom: I will, with Daisy, take to the meadows, and have no donbt bnt I shall soon overtake them.\" \" Warringdale,\" he shouted, '\u25a0 we shall Jieet"], [105, "99 EDITH HERON. \" All right, Captain !\" \" Don't you past them, Tom.\" \" Oh, no ; I will keep on this tide of them till yon blow that whistle for me.\" \"That will do.\" \" I rather think his Grace the Duke will Uke tho reins.\" Heron listened to all this incredulously; bu\" from the next few words they uttered, he was better able to come to some opinion, whether right or wrong, on the matter. \" Your lordship actually meani to rob them ? ' asked the Colonel. CHAPTER COXI. \" Oh, undoubtedly !\" \" It will be capital sport !\" \" Excellent, I expect ; and I intend to produce the watches and purset sttha Duchets't entertain ment to-morrow night !\" \" Capital ! capital I\" \" Yes ; I flitter myself that the little affair will make a sensation, and be the best part of the feto that her Grace has taken so much trouble and spent so much money to make attractive, at Bane lagh.\" Heron considered. CAPTAIN HERON DISPOSSESSES LORD WAHRIKG DALE OF HIS FOREST HOME, AND STOPS TBE SHAM MAIL COACH. Captain Heron rode on aboui fifty paces, till he came to a gate on the left-hand side of the road that led into the fields. Perhaps the gate might have been opened with some trouble, but it was the easier and shorter mode of operations for Daisy to leap it Heron backed the gallant creature as far across the road as the hedge on the other side would per mit, and then cried out, \"Leap, Daisy \u2014 leap 1\" Daisy was over the gate as if she had had wings with which to do such feats at pleasure- Turning, then, to the right. Heron set off at a swift racing pace along the meadows in a parallel line with the hedgerow. The two horsemen, who bore bo completely all the outward semblance of highwaymen, had, as they were well mounted, made, by this time, con siderable progress. Bat Heron knew that he should soon be able to overtake them, at, at the pace he now went, it it no exaggeration to say that Daisy went two feet while the horsemen on the road went one. It was ju.t possible that these two persons were really members of the aristocracy, and were a lord and a colonel. If so, the object of their present disguise was a practical joke. But there was one difficulty. They projected stopping a public mail coach on the King's highway ! There was no joke in that First of all, some one might resist, and the con flict, began as a joke, might end as a tragedy Secondly, it would be no aniwer to a charge of felony to say that the matter was only a practical piece of pleasantry. But Heron heard more. \" What an odd fancy it it, Colonel,\" said he who was called my lord, \" for such a man as the Duke to set up and drive a stage coach !\" \" Very, but yet common enough.\" \"Yes! yes!\" \" Do yon know, my lord, that I have an idea on that subject?\" \"What is it\" The sound of the horses' feet on the road came plainly to Heron's ears- Daisy's progress, being on the soft turf of the fields, was muffi . d as to sound, and could not have been heard nnless specially listened for. But just as Heron came abreast of the two high waymen, they ceased the hard trot at whioh they had been going, and subsided inio a very quiet walk. \"Just this. When I find a young nobleman take to such matters, I always fancy that at tome time or another there has been a handsome grocm in the family, and a frail ladyship.\" \"Ha! ha! Capital; you have hit it, Colonel1\" By this time Heron began to have a better no tion still of the state of affairs. The long, prolonged notes of a horn came again on the night air. Heron guessed tbat the Coach which was so evi dently upon the road had basn stopped to change horses and was now starting again. So close to the hedgerow as he was now with Daisy, he could hear distinctly what the two high waymen said to each other. Their discourse was rather mysterious. \" Wel), my lord,\" said one, \" I think we shall soon test the nerves of onr party in the stage coach.\" The coooh which Was approaching was one of those vehicles started by some nobleman whoso lordly ambition wat to be a stage coachman, and theie two mock highwayman were two of his ac quaintances, who intended that he should have the practical joke played upon him of being stopped by knights of the road Heron smiled as le patted the neck of his noble and sagacious Daily. \" It may be,\" he said in a low tone, \u2014 \" it may be, Daisy, that we shall be able te turn this joke into a reality.\" Heron paused then, and let the two sham highwaymen pass him, for he wished to intercept Tom Bipon, who by this time was likely to be near at hand In a few seconds Heron heard the sound of the horse's feet Tom Bipon rode, and he looked over the hedgerow to call to him. \"Tom! Tom!\" \" I think so, too. Colonel,\" replied the other. Heron was puzzled. Were these two fellows only giving themselves the titles respectively of \" lord \" and \" colonel r from some absurd fancy so to do, or were they really what they implied they were ? That was a question Bnt as Heron kept pace with them, he resolved to pay every possiblesattention to what they said, that be might oome to some correct conclusion on the subject. The horn of what no donbt was a coach ad vancing sounded again \" There thay come, my lord !\" said the one of the highwaymen who was called \" Colonel \" by the other. \" Yes, Captain.\" \" Stop now ; I will come over to yon. Oat of the way of Daisy's leap !~ \" All right, Captain !\" Another moment, and Daisy was in the roadway \"Yes, Colonel- I wonder if the Marquis is driving himself to-night ?\""], [106, "EDITH HEKON. 100 by the ifde of Tom Ripon and the other horte, and then Heron possessed Tom with the itory that be had heard, and his own impresiions i a regard to the whole affair. In about a minute and ahalf the coaoh reaohed the spot where th* conflict, if there wat to be one at all, was snre to take place. The two mock highwaymen had separated, placing themselves respectively on each side of the road ; and as the stage cotch was not going at any very great speed, at soon as the reflection from the lamps fell upon them they must have been well teen by all its passengers. And, in fact, Felix Heron had a better view of theie two personages now than he hod ever bad before. And he could not but tmile at the ferocious manner in which they were got np to play the part of highwaymen. Scarlet coats, with the lappets thrown open at the breast, to exhibit the stocks of a pair of pis tols. Crape masks nearly down to the chin, and low crowned hats, pulled as far down over the brow at possible. \"Halt!\" oried one of the mock highwaymen. \" Your lives be on your own heads I\" \"Haiti\" shouted the other: \" my noble friend, Captain Blood, means your deaths on yonr owu heads.\" \"So I do, Captain Gore,\" reiponded the other. \" Fire !\" Tee report of two pistols, one from each of the mock highwaymen, had all the effect they in tended upon the coach and its occupants. \" Egad 1\" said the person who wat driving, and who had an eye-glatt at hit eye \u2014 \"egad! ibis looks serious. We're stopped by high way men, by Jove I\" \" Sink me, yonr Grace 1\" said a supereilloui looking personage, who sat next him ou the box seat ' Sink me, if we shall not be all robbed and murdered ia tbe regular way.\" \" Stir another inoh,\" ihonted one of the pre tended highwaymen, \" and we will ihatter every body's skull to atoms.\" \" Stir half an inch, or even a quarter, and I will doit!\" \" Egad ! this looki serious. Woa 1 woa, leaders ! Ned Rocket, where are yon ?\" \" Here, your Grace,\" taid a weak, timid voice from the back portion of the coach. \" Well, egad ! it strikes me yon ought to fire the blunderbuss, Ned Rocket!\" \" So I would, your Graoe, bnt it won't go off.\" \" Egad 1 you told me job had loaded it.\" * Yes, your Grace ; bat it was with the tweet meatt that Lady Betty Blueacre gave ns at May Fair.\" \" It will be capital fun, Oaptain.\" \" It will, and capiul sport too, no doubt I pro pose that we watch the whole affair, Tom, and then rob the robbers.\" \" That's it ! that's it, Oaptain !\" \" It will be so very obliging for them to take the trouble of bringing the coaoh with their own intimate friends in it to a stand-still, and then to give up to us all they take.\" \" Excellent 1 excellent, Oaptain! Let ns give them a good fright, Oaptain, while we are about it.\" \" We will so. Oome on ; keep very quiet and close to the hedgerow. Ah! this it just the very thing \u2014 a double hedge, where we can see and hear all that passes.\" Captain Heron aud Tom Ripon had noticed one of those double hedgerows to common in England, where, in addition to a regular road, with its bank and luxuriant hedgerow on each tide, there was a little supplementary way, at if an extra half-mi'e or bo of hedge and tree had been made on the side about four or five feet into the highway. These little extra shadowy pathways no doubt have some special origin, and at one time had some special use which is now forgotten; but there in country dittrictt they remain, beautifully cool aud verdant even in the midday heat. It was in such a place at this, occurring in such au opportune juncture, that Tom Ripon and Cap tain Heron were able to await the progress of events in connexion with the ttage coach and its aristooratlo occupants A more eligible spot for the species of obser vation which they wished to bring npon the whole transaction could not postibly be found ; and as the ex'ent of the narrow sort of lane in which they were was at least three quarters of a mile, the collision between the two amateur highwaymen and the sham stage coach was certain to take place within that space. Tom Ripon was about to make some observa tion, but as the two horsemen who respectively denominated themselves a lord and a colonel at that moment rode up, and actually halted oppo site to where Heron and his follower were in hiding, Tom's Captain checked him with a low hush, and they remained profoundly silent \"This it the very place, Colonel,\" remarked that one of the mock highwaymen who was called my lord, \u2014 \" this is the very place for our operations.\" \" It is as excellent, my lord, as if we had con trived it ourselves.\" \" Then, egad ! we're In for It \" The two sham highwaymen had by thit time ridden up reipeotively to eaoh window of the coaoh, and putting on the most bullying and ferocious voice they could command, they eaoh dashed the barrel of a pistol on to the window ledge, as they both shouted in chorus, \" Yonr watches, money aud valuable! ; or yonr li v e9, or altogether, if yon like better. Quiok, for we have no time to lose !\" The coaoh was occupied by some private f riendi of his Grace the Duke who drove it, and whose little eccentrioity was to take the rather disreputa ble let that called themselves his intimates, tome ten or twelve milts out of town and back again, at if they had gone a regular ttage coach jonrney, and he the accredited drfVer. A conple of ladies, called so by conrtety, were in the vehicle, and they, as a matter of oourse, began screaming with all their might It was not that they bad anything to lose, or \" Yes, only look at its capabilities. The mo ment we have frightened them half out of their lives and taken from them their watches and puriet, we can ride into this little lane by tbe road side, and I warrant me they'll be in too great a fright to know where we have gone.\" The horn blown by some one on the coach top sounded again, and it was quite evident that the coaoh was very near at hand. The tramp of its four horses wat plainly to be heard. The gleaming of its slde-lampt came gliding along the hedgerows. \"It eeems to me, Tom,\" whispered Heron, \" that we have now nothing to do but to wait the coorse of events.\" \" That's all, Captain.\""], [107, "101 EDITH HEE0N. were in the slightest degree afraid, but the oppor tunity of making a noise was not to be disre garded. The two gentlemen who were with them, like wise so called by courtesy, were genuine poltroons, and shook with fear. their pockets pretty well stuffed with booty, and were satisfied that they had carried that part of the joke far enough. \" Yon may drive on now, coachman,\" said the one who was ealled Colonel ; \" and I hope you and your patiengeri will remember os long os yon live the two notorious and celebrated highway men, Captain Gore and Captain Blood I\" \" Spare onr lives,\" said one, \" and take all we have.\" \" Fire and fury 1\" cried one of the sham high waymen. \" I don't know that we shall, unless yon are quick about it !\" \" Thunder and crackers !\" said the other, \" I feel half a mind to blow the roof off the coach ! What do yon say, Captain Gore, to flinging our powder fliSks into the concern, and then show a light? P ff, flare, bang! Away everything would go, aud everybody with it ! \" \" Murder ! Have mercy npon us !\" shouted the other gentlemen from the coach. With nervous eagerness, they divested them selves of their ringt and watches, aud likewise handed, each of them, a well-filled purse to the mock highwaymen. \" WiU that do, Captain Gore ?\" \" Not quite, Captain Blood ; we must attend to the ladies.\" CHAPTER CCXIL FELIX HERON MIKES A GOOD EOOTT, AND REACHES HOME IN SAFETY. With theie words, the two gentlemen \u2014 for such, no doubt, they were, both by birth and fortune \u2014 who had carried out the practical joke of stopping their friends' coach on the highway, rode oS. They took the route towards town. \" Well, Captain,\" said Tom, \" I call all that rather a cool affair 1\" \" Hush I Let the stage coach go !\" \" Egad, friends all !\" said the noble Duke who drove the coach, \" I wonld not have missed this little affair for the bett horse in my racing stables !\" \" Oh, certainly ! Now, ladies, if you please- I see yon have handsome earrings ; and if yon can not get them ont quickly, we have a shorthand way of taking them, with a bit of the ear along with them !\" \" It's all very well for your Grace, who has lost nothing !\" responded the personage who sat by his side. \"Brutes!\" \" Egad, yes ! Ha, ha ' Well, never mind ; it's all a part of the scuffla ! Ya ! Hip ! hip Come np !\" The four horses were set in motion again, and off went the stage coach. \" Now, Tom,\" said Captain Heron, \" you may \u25a0peak os much as yon like ; and I don't see why we shouldn't come in for onr shore in this night's work\" \" Monsters!\" \u2022* Lo jk sharp\u2014 look sharp I Time fiies, and so must we !\" \" Here, Jeremiah,\" said one of the gentlemen, still shaking with fear ; \" do give them everything, or they'll be the death of ns all !\" \" You'll make it np to me double ?\" \" We will\u2014 we will I\" \"There then! There, Mr. Highwayman ; and I can only say I never came near such a wretch in my life ! Pull a bit of my ear off, indeed ! You ought to have yonr own boxed !\" \" Ladies,\" said the mock highwayman, who waa called my lord, \" we have now the distinguished pleasure of bidding yon good night and hope sincerely yon will enjoy yonnelf at the Duchets's ball to-morrow.\" \" Nor L Captain. It will be a better joke still to rob the robbers, won't it ?\" \" I think it will. Come on as quick as you can. A stern chase, at they lay at sea, it a long chase ; and we may have a good gallop before we come np with our men, who are not badly mounted.\" \" Hoy 1 hoy ! Stop, Captain ! It will be ever so much better to let me go first, or else Daisy will leave me a mile behind !\" The two gentlemen, as well as the two ladies who were within the coach, appeared to be very much surprised at this remark from a highwayman on a lonely road some six or eight miles away from London. Captain Heron wot of a different opinion ox that point, and merely waved his arm to Tom as he put Daisy to speed and galloped on. Tom Bipon had, then, no resource but to make the best speed he could, which was good speed, although the horse he rode had no pretensions to the fleetness of such a racer as Daisy. In about ten minutes, Captain Heron came to the foot of rather a steep bill , and at he drew rein a little, in order to prevent Daisy from going at full speed np the steep incline, which the other wise would, he taw a couple of mounted men some half-way up the hill, going at a gentle walk. That they were the two sham knights of the road whom he wished to come np with he law at a second glance ; for they were high enough up the hill for their heads and hats to be reflected well against the rather light patch of iky that seemed to crown its summit and which looked towards the east, where the first faint effulgence of morn ing light was beginning to be teen. Tom Ripon was about a mile behind. But that was not much on a good road, with a tolerable horse. \" Egad !\" cried the Duke \u2014 and he was really a Duke who drove the vehiole \u2014 \" have yon settled everything with the intidei ?\" \" Yes,\" cried the two highwaymen, in chorus ; \" and we are now going to begin npon the outs.\" \" Well, egad ! yon see, I am the ooachman ; and little Ned Rocket, there, with the blunderbuss that won't go off, is the guard.\" \" We don't interfere with yon, but that gentle man sitting by yonr Bide looks as if he had some thing in his pocket !\" \"No, no!\" cried the personage alluded to. \" I have not I\" \" Egad !\" said the Duke,\u2014\" you mustn't tay that ! It never strnak me when I set np a coach that to make things regular it ought to be stopped on the highway ; and now that it is so, why it's all right and proper that yon should be robbed !\" With a very bad grace, this person surrendered a watch and seals and a pocket-book. By this time the two mock highwaymen had Cap'ain Heron, however, had no idea of waiting"], [108, "102 EDITH HERON. for Tom Ripon when only two men were in ques tion ; and he at once rode up to the Colonel and \" my lord,\" whoever he might really be in re gard to actnal title. The two horsemen who had perpetrated so ca pital a joke, os no doubt they thought it, on tbe stage coach of their friend the Dnke, only casually glanced back as they heard the rapid trot of a horse's feet on the road behind them. The next moment Heron had passed them ; and then, wheeling Daisy round he faced them both. This action on the part of Felix Heron took the two gentlemen by surprise ; and for tho first mo ment they began, as tbe Americans say, to \" realize\" the faot that this single strange horse man had something to say to them. What that something was, they were not long left in doub* concerning. Captain Heron, as he reined in Daisy till she stood as still ss a statne, spoke calmly. \" My lord, and you, Colonel, allow me to state a proposition which I think neither of yon will feel inclined to dispute. A joke, however capital it may be in conception, is nothing unless carried ont You did your parts well in robbing his Grace and the stage coach ; it is now my turn to orv ' Stand, and deliver !'\" The two sham highwaymen looked at each other in mate surprise ; and then Captain Heron, who kept his eyes firmly fixed upon them, taw that he who wat called the Colonel ilowly and furtively moved hit band towards the holster of hit saddle. where, possibly, he might be provided with loaded pistols, notwithstanding that he and his friend had sallied forth merely to perpetrate a jett. Heron at once dropped his reins upon the neck of Daisy, who he knew would not move an inch. Rapidly, then, snatching from his saddle his own pistols, he held one in each hand, covering the two horsemen, as he said, in a voice that had about it a tone of stern determination tbat was not to be trifled with, \" I warn yon, gentlemen ! The affairs of to-night have had a farcical character ; beware that they do not end in a tragedy !\" The hand of the Colonel slowly came away again from the butt of the pistol he intended to gratp. \" Hold !\" cried Heron. \"I dislike bloodshed for its own sake ; and if yon have any real scn-plei abont yielding to one man, I can dispel them !\" \"How?\" \" Listen !\" The clatter of horses' feet that came now plainly enough upon the night air, showed that some one was approaching. Who it was, the two personages had no means of knowing ; but from the looks they exchanged, it was tolerably evident they hoped it might be some one whose accidental presence wonld turn the tide of affairs entirely in their favonr. Felix Heron knew well that it was Tom Bipon, and that although his appearance was not abso lutely wanted, yet that it wonld materially change the aspect of affairs. Willing, however, to try what might be the feeling of the Colonel and the noble lord provided they really had any advantage in the shape of nnmbers, he put on an air of mock candour, as he said, \" Well, gentlemen, I cannot pretend to say, but that three to one wonld be long odds ; and I suppose my belt plan would be to go off, wishing myself better fortune in the time to come ?\" * Go off with yon, in the fiend's name I\" said his lordship, \" so that yon don't spoil the capital joke we've been at some pains to carry ont to night!\" \" I don't know that, my lord !\" cried the Co lonel. \" It teemt to me we ought to apprehend this fellow I\" Heron smiled, for at this moment Tom Ripon galloped np, and, touching his hat, he cried ont, \" Any ordert, Oaptain ?\" My lord whistled rather ruefully. The Colonel made a movement as though he wonld have shot past Heron, if he could, and trusted to the heels of his horse. \" No, sir!\" oried Heron, \u2014 \" that will not do I My horse wonld outstrip yours in a half-mile run ; and, moreover, I might feel inclined to send some thing after yon swifter still !\" Captain Heron looked significantly at his pis tols as he spoke. It was quite evident now to the two arit tocratio jesters on the road that their sport was at an end. They looked particularly crest-fallen, and Felix Heron enjoyed their discomfiture exceedingly, as he pnt on a look of unconcern, saying to Tom Ripon, \" Yon will be so good as to take care of what these gentlemen will hand over to yon : and now, sirs, I beg that yon will be qnick about it, for we have other business on the road to-night I\" A very few minutes sufficed to place in the postetsion of Tom Bipon the whole of the booty that had been taken from the coach, while Felix Heron looked on as though he had been the most uninterested spectator in the world. \" Now, gentlemen, I have the honour to bid yon good night I\" he said ; \" and when we meet again it will probably be in the saloors of the Duabess !\" Thii expression Heron had borrowed from the brief convenation he had overheard between the aristooratio highwaymer , and he merely made me of it now for the purpose of adding to their discom fiture ; not that he had any real intention of at tempting to enoounter them again at any duchess's, nor had he, in fact, the least notion of which duchess was alluded to. But Felix Heron, like the rest of the world, was oarried hither and thither by tbe 'orce of circum stances ; and it was his fate, ultimately, not only A look of blank dismay sat npon the faces of both the mock highwaymen ; and then it was the one called \" my lord,\" who spoke in a tone of vex ation. \" What is that you want ? or is this,af ter all, only a joke ?\" \" That is all, my lord I It it bnt a similar joka to that which yon have yourself practited ; but it wonld be a poor one without its termination. And therefore, gentlemen, I tell yen I not only want your own watches, jewellery, and money, but the whole of the booty yon have taken from his Grace's visitors in the stage coach !\" My lord and the Colonel looked rather blank at these words. Whether the assanlt of Captain Heron npon them was a mere jest or a piece of serious basi nets, it was equally evident that the laugh would be against them. The Colonel was more irate of the two. His anger and mortifioation almost lent him courage enongh to engage in a contest with Oap tain Heron- \" Do you think, sir,\" he said, \" be yon whom yon may, that we will, being two of ns, calmly surrender to one ?\" \" Yes, I do think so !\" \" Then yon will find yourself mittaken I\""], [109, "103 EDITH HERON. o disoover who the Duchess in question was, but actually to make one at the brilliant assemblage where his lordship and the Colonel had hoped tbat the relation of their practical joke npon the Duke and his stage coaoh wonld be the grand jest of the evening. We will not anticipate, however. Sufficient were the events which that night surrounded Captain Heron. Tom Ripon's pockets were tolerably capacious. bnt they were tolerably well filled, not only with the booty which my lord and the Colonel had possessed themselves of, but likewise with a quan - tity of articles whioh, in their vexation, they handed over to him from their own pockets. \" All's right, Oaptain !\" cried Tom. \" Gentlemen,\" said Captain Heron, \" I advise yon to pass on !\" \" I suppose we may do that, or not, at our plea sure !\" said the Colonel. \" It it a poor privilege to those who are robbed on the highway to please themselves os to which ronte they take I \" \" Beware !\" said Heron. \" I am the most patient man alive for ten minutes, bnt at the end of that time I will not answer for what may happen !\" \" Oome on, Colonel,\" cried he who was called \" my lord.\" \"What is the use of chaffering now that the mischief it done ?\" that he was followed closely by, or was permitted to follow, that redoubtable personage. But, on this occasion, the lane was passed through withont any adventure of any kind or description. But both Heron and Tom Bipon, npon emerg ing from it, full in the face of the eastern sky, were not a little surprised at the progress which the dawn had made. A pale yellow light\u2014 bnt still one which made every objeot visible \u2014 shone upon the vegetation and upon their faces \u2014 their hones and their dress. A little hillock, at a short distance in front of them, had the effect of hiding the adjacent coca try, bnt Felix Heron felt certain that he heard the sound of voices immediately on the other side of it He made a sign to Tom Ripon to be silent They both listened attentively. A high voice was speaking. A voice, not nnpleasant in its intonation, bat borrowing its high charaoter evidently from the excited feelings of the speaker. \"Be it so, then, my Lord Claokington,\" said the voice. \" I know not, and cannot conjecture, what misadventure has befallen the young officer who was to have seconded me in this enoounter ; bnt, assuming that the gentleman yon have bronght with yon is a man of hononr, I am conlent that he should do duty for both sides I\" If Captain Heron was surprised to hear these words in so lovely a spot, at such an hour in the morning, he was still more so when they were re plied to in the undoubted accents of Lord Clack \u2022 ington. \" Marquil, you have forced me to this meeting, and most reluctantly have I come into the field to fight with one who has not yet attained hit majority !\" \" Peace, sir, peace ! This is idle nonsense ! Yonr character is well known, and it will be well if I succeed in ridding the English Court of one of its ancient and hoary- headed disgraces 1\" \" Your tecond, Marquis, is of a different opinion, since he comes not ! \" His lordship struck spurs into his horse, and started off at a gallop. The Colonel thought it was too much to be left alone in such suspicious company as Tom Bipon and Oaptain Heron, so he even followed his lord ship as quickly as lie could. Heron paused until the lost sounds of their horses' feet had died away. \" Come, Tom,\" he laid. \" Let us make our way through Woodford to town, and we thall not en counter these men again.\" \" This way, then, Captain ; there is the nar rowest lane in all the country side close at hand 1\" \" I know it \u2014 I know it ! It is more like a foot path than a bridle road.\" \" Yes, Oaptain, and it leads direct through Woodford to town. And what a lncky thing it is that, after all, we've not had onr josrney for nothing, but have actually found the gold we came to Epping to look for !\" \" Found it, Tom ?\" \" Yes, surely ; it's in my pocket, isn't it ?

We need not look to the right nor to the left, for the lane is a mile and a half in length, and the hedges on each side are a good fifteen feet in height 1\" This lane was well known to Captain Heron os being one of the most dismal thoroughfares in the neighbourhood of Epping. It had all the appearance of a long, narrow tube, and, moreover, had the reputation of being haunted. This evil repnte doubtless arose from the fact that about the middle of it there was a itrange echo, which repeated, first at one end and then at the other, any sound that might be there made. Tom Ripon was by no means so delighted with this lane at ever to go down it by himself, but bis faith in Captain Heron was so great that he would have gone anywhere could he only be quite sure \" At that I marvel much ; bnt, since I agree to accept yours, we need not wait !\" \" As you please \u2014 as you please !

Tbe yonng Marquis, who wat a slightly-built, fair-haired youth, bnt with a strikingly handsome and singularly intellectual-looking countenance, was the very picture of surprise. Heron lifted his hat a few inches above his head, and in those courteous tones which bespoke him the well-bred gentleman, he spoke again. \" Chance hat made me a listener to a chance dialogue, which has informed me of a difficulty that among gentlemen ought not to exist. It ap pears that a duel is in progress, and feeling bound to believe that the quarrel is a good one, I offer yon my services, Marquis, as frankly as I hope yon will accept them.\" \" Perdition seize you !\" shrieked Lord Clack ington.

Lord Claokington looked so ghastly pale, that his thin, wrinkled physiognomy presented the as pect of some hideous waxen image rather than anything hnman. Felix Heron had by mere accident hit upon the very plan which they had concocted for the pur pose of murdering the young Marquis, whioh was that the Major was to load both the pistols, but only to put a bu' let into that one whioh he handed to Lord Clackington. A look of suspicion darted acrosi the face of the yonng Marquil. \" Gracious heaven 1\" he cried. \" Can it be pos sible that \" \" Hash !\u2014 not a word !

I fancy that more than half of the disputes in the world are about words merely ; and it seems that we all take different views about this word arrangement.\" The Major looked doubtful. Lord Clackington's visage fell again. \"In my opinion,\" added Heron, \"the affair, whatever it is, is being arranged in the only way which offers itself to the feelings of a gentle man.\" \" Good !\" cried the young Marquis. Heron smiled. \" Come, Major,\" he said, \" you look for your principal, and I will do the same for mine.\" \"One moment,\" said Lord Clackington. \"Well my lord?\" \"The young Marquis of Ormond here has challenged me, because he will have it that I have had some hand in the\u2014 the \u2014 a\u2014 abduction\u2014 or Edith.\u2014 No. 66. call it what you will \u2014 of a young lady to whom he is attached.\" \" I am sure of it !\" said the Marquis1 of (. r mond, whose title Felix Heron had just heard for the first time, \u2014 \" I am quite sure of it !\" \" You think so,\" added Lord Clackington. \" But as we are, I hope, all gentlemen, and may speak freely here, I beg to say that this person, the Baron Von Peck, whom you are so ready to take as a second, was actually employed by a great personage in the matter of which you com plain, because I was too scrupulous.\" \" Infamous slanderer !\" cried Heron. \" It is true !\" \"One moment!\" said the Marquis of Ormond. \"I have a letter here which will resoH'e my doubts.\" The young nobleman took a smnll folded note from his pocket, and having first lightly pressed it to hia lips, he opened it."], [112, "106 EDITH HERON. Lord Clackington glanced from the face of one to the other with a look of deep distress. He evidently made two or three weak and im becile attempts at flight, but his ancient legs, how ever nimble they might be on occasions in the carrying him about to the perpetration of various iniquities, failed him now, and he could not move. He read half aloud: \u2014 \" And, dear Arthur, should you ever encounter a gentleman who names himself the Baron Von Peck, know him to be one of the dearest friends of your Marianna !\" \" Marianna !\" exclaimed Heron. \" Yes, Marianna !\" \"Quick, my lord!\" cried Heron. \"Time presses !\" Heron handed one of the pistols to the Marquis of Ormond. \" A king's orphan ?\" \" The same, sir.\" \" Then I am the same Baron Von Peck she \"Hold\u2014 hold!\" cried Lord Clackington. \"One moment !\" speaks of !\" The young Marquis turned with a triumphant look to Lord Clackington. \"My lord, I am quite satisfied with my second.\" The Major looked grim and ghastly. \" One moment !\" added Clackington. \" Life is sweet to all, and doubly so to the young Marquis. You are yet but on the threshold of existence, and surely do not wish to bid the world good-bye !\" \" He has no such intention,\" interposed Heron. \"It is you, my Lord Clackington, who may either bid it good-bye or leave it without any ceremony, as it may please you on this occasion.\" \"But, Baron \" \" Tush, tush ! My lord, this is trifling !\" \"A moment more!\" \"And I with my principal,\" said Heron, who was much pleased to hear it, as ho hoped soon to have it in his power to take the Marquis of Or mond home with him to Whitcombe House and to Marianna. \" Now, sir,\" said Heron, \" the pistols !\" \"Here!\" The Major shook visibly. Heron looked at the pistol that was handed to him by the Major, and then said, \"Marquis, did you bring no weapons with you ?\" \" I expected my second with them.\" \" Oh, true, true ! I am your second, and here they are.\" \"Marquis,\" oried Heron, in a loud tone, \"if your opponent will not move from where he is, you may suppose that is the spot upon which he chooses to stand and be shot !\" \" No, no !\" \" Yes,' I say ! And, since I happen to be here accidentally, and there are two pairs of pistols on the ground, I will engage with the Major here while you settle matters with his lordship.\" \" Not for worlds !\" shrieked the Major. \"But I say yes, sir ; for I feel that I must have offended you deeply.\" \"Not at all \u2014 not at all! I never had such a high respect for any gentleman in all my life !\" \" Then you have offended me, so that it comes to the same thing.\" \" I will apologize, Baron \u2014 I will apologize !\" \" I never accept apologies.\" \"Then run, my lord \u2014 run!\" shouted the Major ; \" for this bloodthirsty Baron is evidently bent upon our destruction ! Bun, my lord \u2014 run!\" As he spoke, Felix Heron took from the pocket in the breast of his coat, where he always kept them, those long, bright-barrelled, highly-finished pistols, on which he knew he could so well de pend. Lord Clackington seemed ready to sink into the very earth with fear. That he meditated flight Heron could see ; and he was not altogether indisposed to indulge my Lord Clackington in such a course. Felix knew well that a coward turned at bay might probably prove as dangerous to others as to himself, and he had already seen enough of the 3\"Oung and gallant Marquis of Ormond to feel a great interest in whatever might befall him. But the truth was, my Lord Clackington was getting paralyzed with fear ; and although he would gladly have fled from, to him, the terrible Baron Von Peck, and had every disposition in the world to do so, he was fast losing the power. The Major, too, as he looked at his principal, and saw the deadly fear that was coming over him, seemed to add all that shrinking terror to Iris own, until the sum of it was too much for his endurance. Li rd Clackington seemed to be roused to a sudden energy by these words. He turned and fled. The Major took an opposite direction, and Heron spoke rapidly to the young Marquis. \" Fire after him, but don't hit him ! He is not worth your vengeance ; and the mere report of a pistol will go nigh to kill him. I will send a bullet after my Lord Clackington, for I've old scores to settle with him, although I will not kill him.\" \" My lords, and you, Baron,\" he said, in a _.emb_ing voice, \" I'm afraid I don't feel very well.\" \" I am certain of it !\" said Heron, sarcasti cally. The two pistols were discharged almost simul taneously. The effect was curious. \" Then, sir, for a Bick man to be a second in a duel, you know, is one of those things that ought not to bo.\" Both Lord Clackington and the Major fully be lieved themselves to be hit, and fell to the ground as if they had been so, rolling over, when there, in the most ludicrous manner. \" Oh, sir,\" added Heron, \" we will excuse a great deal in a gentleman, who, so short a time ago, was willing to do that service for both par ties. Come, sir, place your principal, for my time is short, aud I have none to waste.\" \"And my patience is exhausted!\" said the Marquis. Indeed, so complete was tho downfall of each of these persons, that the Marquis of Ormond and Felix Heron looked at each other in doubt for a few seconds as to whether their pistol-shots had not really taken effect"], [113, "107 EDITH HERON. But Lord Clackington and the gallant Major scrambled to their feet again, and set off, each with increased speed, and, as before, in opposite directions. \"Not her greatest,\" said Heron, significantly. \" Ah ! What would you say, Baron ?\" \" I would say that that wretched Lord Clack ington, who, with old age, has not one of the qualities which should render it respected, is but the tool of one greater than himself.\" \" Alas, then, I despair !\" \" Not so. Your visit to this spot has been far from fruitless ; and had your vengeance been sated to its utmost, it would not have advanced the objects of your heart so much as a few casual words with the Baron Von Peck !\" The Major got clear off, and soon disappeared behind a clump of trees. Lord Clackington was not so lucky. Skirting the little hillock where Tom Ripon lay concealed, his lordship, without the least sus picion that an enemy was in that direction, came right upon Tom and the two horses. Heron's faithful young follower had been a delighted and attentive spectator of the whole scene. Heron lifted his hat slightly as he spoke. \" Yes, yes !\" cried the young Marquis, with an air of enthusiastic vehemence. \" Why do I for get that Marianna gave me that name as belong ing to one whom I might trust ?\" \"Never forget it, Marquis, but trust me still, and accompany me to London.\" \" With pleasure ! Dispose of me as you will ; I am at your service, Baron !\" \" It is wisely resolved.\" Heron blew a shrill note upon his silver whistle, and Tom Bipon stood up upon the brow of the1 hill as he shouted out, \" Here, Captain, here ! All's right ! The old 'un is still kicking in the ditch down there below. He seems to be the wrong end uppermost ; but it don't matter !\" \" The boy calls you Captain,\" said the Mar quis. \" Yes. An old familiar habit,\" cried Heron, as he smiled. \" He and I have been in the wars together.\" Leaving the two horses to take care of each other, which he knew they would do very well, or, rather, with a perfect confidence that Daisy would not stray from the spot, nor permit her four-footed companion to do so, Tom Ripon, by lying flat upon the ground, had succeeded in just projecting his head over the brow of the hillock so as to see everything, and yet be himself hidden by the low shrubs and brushwood with which it abounded. \"Where are you coming to?\" cried Tom, as he set himself rolling so as to intercept the un fortunate Lord Clackington. The latter was at speed, and could not stop himself. He encountered Tom Ripon, and over he went. \"Now, stupid,\" cried Tom, \"can't you look afore you 1 Oh, you needn't try that dodge ; there's nobody else a comin' !\" The \" dodge \" Tom alluded to was the same rolling process down the side of the hillock which had enabled him so cleverly to intercept Lord Clackington. \" Then you have seen service, Baron ?\" \" Yes. But that is a point we will not discuss at present. Tom, bring the horses down.\" \" Yes, Captain.\" Tom Ripon led down Daisy and his own horse to the spot where the duel was to have taken place. \" My lord,\" said Heron, \" I presume you have no steed at hand ?\" But there was an essential difference. Tom rolled down the hillock on purpose. Lord Clackington's was an involuntary action, and only ended in a sedgy ditch covered with green slime that ran at the foot of the Uttle emi nence. \" Yes. I trotted down here from London, and left my horse at a roadside inn, named 'The Wheatsheaf.' \" While this dramatic scene was going on be tween Tom Bipon and Lord Clackington, Felix Heron had addressed a few words to the surprised aud indignant Marquis of Ormond. Tom Eipon's countenance brightened at this announcement, for he had began to suspect that the next proposition of Captain Heron would be that he should lend his horse to the young Mar quis of Ormond, and find his own way to London in the best manner he could. \" My Lord Ormond,\" he said, \" I presume by this time you can have no doubt of the character of the two persons whom you so unsuspiciously met to-day.\" There was no necessity, however, for any such proceeding, and the little party trotted into Lon don without meeting any other adventure worthy of record. \" The cowards !\" \"Worse than cowards! Call them assas sins !': \" You really think, Baron, they contemplated my murder ?\" \"I am certain of it! And when you reach town you will discover that your second, who should havo been here to-day, has been by some act of force or fraud prevented from keeping his appointment.'\" \" Alas ! all this must be too true, Baron ! Be lieve me, sir, I do not forget or under-estimate the service you have rendered me, but my heart is still full of grief aud indignation !\" \" I doubt it not.\" \" Grief for the loss of her whom I love, and in dignation that I have come here and not suc ceeded in avenging myself upon her greatest Tom took charge of the horses.

It was at the corner of Pall Mall that Felix Heron dismounted ; and, patting the neck of Daisy, gave her into the charge of Tom Bipon to take round with his own steed, and that of the young Mar quis of Ormond, to the stables of Whitcombe House. too!\""], [114, "EDITH HERON. 108 That there was some great mystery about the Baron Von Peck the Marquis was not at all slow to perceive, but what it was he could not at the present moment divine. The manner of Captain neron, however, was quite sufficient to convince him that that mystery was one the solution of which ho had no cause to noble lady, from whom, I feel convinced, you will hear some news of your Marianna.\" \" On the invocation of that name, Baron, I would follow you to death itself I\" The Marquis of Ormond followed Felix Heron up the grand staircase of Whitcombe House, and into that same green drawing-room which has been so frequently presented to the reader as tho scene of some of the most curious episodes in this narrative. dread. Already was the name of the Baron Von Peck favourably associated in his mind with that of Marianna; and he implicitly followed Heron wherever it might please him to lead. It was now broad daylight ; and Felix Horon felt the necessity of housing himself as soon as possible. The confidence he felt in his disguise as the Baron Von Peck was tolerably perfect ; but still there was a possibility, however remote, of it being penetrated by some of those lynx-eyed in dividuals who would only have been too glad to recognise in the so-called Baron the dashing and daring highwayman, Captain Heron. Arm-in-arm with the young nobleman whose acquaintance he had so singularly made, Heron walked up St. James's Street. The broad threshold of Whitcombe House was reached without any interruption of any kind or description. Felix Heron knew perfectly well that Edith was not likely to be in that apartment, or ho would scarcely have so abruptly introduced the Marquis of Ormond into it ; and, indeed, had Edith been there, Ogle would, by some means, have con trived to let him know. The magnificent and costly room, however, was vacant ; and then, with that courtly grace which was inbred in him, Captain Heron invited the young Marquis to be seated. \" Do not, my lord,\" he 6aid, \" think it strange or wanting in politeness on my part that I leave you alone for a few minutes: the time will speedily come when the mysteries which surround both you and myself, and which likewise implicate tho Countess of Whitcombe, will be fully explained.\" \" I am quite at your Bervice, Baron. I ov\u00bb you already the obligation of a life : dispose of me as you please, and be assured I shall ever put tho best construction upon all your acts and all yo_r words.\" \" Do you reside here, sir ?\" asked the Marquis of Ormond. \" I am permitted to make use of this house as a home,\" was the somewhat ambiguous reply of Captain Heron. The young nobleman was left alone in the green drawing-room ; and it is no impeachment of his charitable disposition to presume that his impression certainly was favourable to the idea of a projected union between the Baron Von Peck and the, as he supposed, widowed Countess of Whitcombe. \" Then,\" added the Marquis, \" you are doubtless acquainted with the noble lady who inhabits it?\" \" I rejoice to say I am, Marquis; but have you too any knowledge of the Countess of Whit er..ibe'r\"' \" Nothing further, Earon, than that a friend of mine, Colonel Trelawney, pointed out the house to me as in the occupation of such a lady, of whom he spoke in the highest terms.\" \"Indeed!\" He had heard that the Countess was young and handsome ; and certainly Felix Heron, in Us disguise as the Baron, looked neither the one nor the other. With all the disposition in the world to be per fectly confidential and trustful in the extreme as regarded the young Marquis of Ormond, Heron yet wished to take the opinion of Edith before confiding to him what may now be called the secret of their lives. \" Yes ; and I understand she is the widow of that famous Captain Heron, undoubtedly claiming to be Earl of Whitcombe, and who, they say, led as adventurous a life in Epping Forest as ever did Bobin Hood iu the nomadic glades of Sherwood long ago.\" In that suite of rooms on the second floor of the mansion, which communicated by the secret pas sages to the stables of Whitcombe House, Edith was waiting, with no small anxiety, the arrival of Heron. Heron could scarcely forbear from smiling ns he knocked at the door of Whitcombe House. That door was immediately opened by Oglo, who was so rejoiced to see Captain Heron safe and sound, that he was almost on the point of uttering an exclamation which would at once have let the Marquis know who he really was, but a glance from Heron stopped the words upon Ogle's lips. Tho sound of his footstep, light as it was, upon the staircase reached her attentive ears. She flew to meet him. \"Safe \u2014 safe again from more perils! Oh, Felix, Felix, when will this life of danger to you abroad, and anxiety to me at home, coose ?\" \"Be not anxious, Edith, but be ever assured that all ie well ! I bring a visitor with mo who is welcome to me, and will be more welcome to you when you know him, but still more welcome to one in whom you feel a friendly interest.\" \"What riddle is all this?\" said Edith, with a smile, as she hung upon Felix Heron's arm. \" It is a riddle easily read, dear Edith I Where is Marianna ?\" \" Is the Countess within?\" asked Heron. \" Yes, Baron,\" replied Ogle, with a half grimace, for h. never liked that title. \"Will you present my compliments to hor, and request for me tho favour of an interview V\" \"Certainly, Baron. Will you bo so good, Baron, as to walk up-stairs, Baron, if you please, Baron ?\" \" There,\" thought Ogle to himself, \" I liopo I've said Baron often enough to convince him that I'm not likely to make any mistake.\" \" Bo so good os to follow me, Marquis,\" said Felix Heron, \"and I will introduce you to this \"With me in yonder apartmont; and the more I see of that dear girl the more fondly I am at tached to her I\""], [115, "EDITH HERON. 109 \" I was sure of it.\" of, perhaps, the basest of men, because he may have have injured the noblest and the best !\" \" It is so ; and, in this case, I fear that was pre cisely the state of affaire. A man grown old in iniquity, a man full ol many crimes, and whose name is the very antagonism of virtue, had been summoned to the field of honour by a mere youth, who, although we know nothing of him but his name, may still have those who love him dearly, and to whom his death may be the greatest cala mity under heaven.\" \" Yes, Felix ; and if no action in all your life but that one were to come to your remembrance in the midst of disaster or of sorrow, it would be sufficient to bring with it a consolation, for you have saved her from worse than death !\" Heron smiled upon Edith as he replied. \" And now I bring her something better than life!\" \"Again enigmatical, Felix. What can that something be ?\" \"A lover!\" A very faint flush came over the features of Marianna. \" A lover ; and to Marianna ! I fancy he will be scarcely welcome, for she is heart-whole.\" \" Which only proves that she has not made you a confidante, Edith, and that I know more of her affections than you do. But come into the deep shadow of this window, and I will tell you all.\" Felix Heron then related to Edith the whole particulars of the adventure in which the young Marquis of Ormond had borne so conspicuous a part, and concluded by the expression of an opinion that the Marquis should be included in the small circle of intimate friends acquainted with the secret of his (Heron's) existence. Edith hesitated, and shrunk a little from the ex tension of this confidence, which, at first sight, seemed more and more to endanger the safety of Heron. Far, very far, was she at that moment from identifying herself in any way in the occurrence of which the Countess of Whitcombe spoke ; but all the elements of a similar case existed in her own heart, and she mentally asked herself, with a sigh, how she would be able to endure such a calamity if it happened to one dear to her. It was scarcely with a feeling of curiosity that she spoke, asking who the parties were in that barbarous duel. \"Both were gentlemen,\" replied Edith, \u2014 \"gentle men and noblemen ; that is to eay, one by courtesy, if those words really possess their real meaning, and one in reality. Old Lord Clackington can, in truth, have nothing in common with the young Marquis of Ormond.\" The moment these words passed the lips of Edith they were bitterly repented of. \" It shall be as you wish, Felix,\" she said. \" I will not, and do not, question for a moment the honour and secrecy of this young man ; but by your own account of him he is fiery and impetu ous, and therefore it is I ask you can you trust his discretion as much as you would trust his loyalty and honour ?\" \" I think so, Edith, and counsel that he be im plicitly relied upon.\" She felt all the heedless cruelty of which she had been guilty when she cast her eyes upon Marianna. The young girl became as pale as death itself, her lips even were bloodless, and the look of re proach and anguish with which she regarded Edith was one that tho Countess of Whitcombe felt that she should never forget. \" Be it so, then ; and there is one safeguard at least which we will not forget, and that is his love for Marianna. I ask but one thing of you, Felix, and that is that you allow me to prepare her for his approach.\" \" Be it as you please. I will remain with him in the green drawing-room, where I have left him full of wonder and impatience at the mysteries that surround the Baron Von Peck. Come to us with Marianna when you will.\" Marianna did not scream, but with a deep-drawn sigh she half slid, half fell from the chair upon which she had been sitting. Who so anxious, then, as Edith to repair, as far as it lay in her power so to do, the unintentional mischief she had created? \" Look up, look up, Marianna !\" she cried. \" He lives ! he lives ! All is well, and he lives ! For give me for thus cruelly playing upon your feel ings. It was done without a thought, and only because I knew that all was well.\" That Edith intended, in some manner peculiar tc herself, to prepare Marianna for the interview with the Marquis of Ormond, Felix Heron could well perceive ; but he was not perfectly aware that Edith felt in the slightest possible degree aggrieved that Marianna had not communicated so important an episode in her young life as her love for the Marquis of Ormond. And Edith was resolved that she would extract the secret from her before permitting her to meet her lover. But Marianna heard her not. Without having absolutely fainted, she was past the consolation of words. Edith flew rather than ran to the head of the stairs and called out aloud \"Felix, Felix ! Here \u2014 here at once, with your friend, the Marquis ! It is his voice alone that will now reach the dull ears of Marianna ; no other sound in all this world can charm her back to life.\" \"Dear Marianna,\" she said, \"my husband, the Earl, has come home, but has met with a most strange adventure, which delayed him past the time he calculated upon.\" \"Indeed!\" remarked Marianna, with all the calmness imaginable, and little suspecting that any one so interesting to her was beneath that roof as the young Marquis. \" Yes ; he came upon a group of persons who wero fighting a duel.\" \" Oh, Lady Whitcombe ! how barbarous is that custom which places a weapon of death in the hands Felix Heron came up the staircase three steps at a time. He was closely followed by the Marquis of Ormond, who, when he reached the entrance of that suite of apartments, looked scarcely less pale than Marianna herself. \" What is it, Edith V what has happened ?\" cried Heron. \"Nothing but what two words may set to rights. Sir, I know you ; you are the Marquis of Ormond. Do not pause for formal introductions or ceremonies, but press onward quickly, for there is"], [116, "110 EDITH HERON. one whom you wish to see in the adjoining apart ment \u2014 one who requires a physicinn, and you are the only one in all the world who can be of the slightest service.\" The Marquis of Ormond looked in a confused, bewildered manner from Edith to Captain Heron, as though he would have said, \" Is this some un fortunate lunatic, or the Countess of Whitcombe?\" \"Pass on, sir,\" added Edith, \"and waste not in hesitation or remark, moments which, in five minutes from now, you will call the most precious of your life.\" casional walks up and down St. James's Street, he kept a tolerable watch upon Lord Warringdale 's rooms until the clock of St. James's Palace struck the hour of one in the morning. He then saw a flash of light from the window of which the blind was drawn up. The outline of a dim and dusky form stood close to the window for a few seconds, as if contemplat ing Whitcombe House. Then the blind was drawn down with an im patient gesture, and Tom Ripon saw no more. But he had seen quite enough for his purpose. His sharp young eyes had immediately detected, in that dim and dusky form which appeared at the window, the coarse and rugged outline of Jonathan Wild. Thus adjured, the young noblemen paused no longer, but with rapid steps entered the apartment where Marianna still remained, hovering almost between Use and death. There was a faint cry \u2014 an exclamation \u2014 and then Edith gently closed the door of communica _io-n. \" All's right !\" said Tom ; \" that's the wretch \u2014 he's there, and he's there for no good. If I don't find out what harm he has in his head, why I'm \u2014 what shall I say? Why, a Frenchman; and I'm sure I shouldn't like to be that for a trifle.\" \"Let them be, Felix,\" she said. \"Let a short time be sacred to them both, and tell me if you have informed this young nobleman who you really are?\" \" Yes, Edith; and he has given me a piece of information in return, which renders double cau tion on my part necessary.\" Tom was resolved upon some course of action. but what it was exactly to be he had not made up his mind, so he still lingered for a time in the deep shadows of Whitcombe House, and kept his gaze upon the windows of the house opposite. \"Now,\" said Tom, \"if I could only make my way into that room without Jonathan being the wiser for it, I would find out the old rascal's schemes. Hilloa ! What's that ? Here's a row !\" \"More peril?\" \" I know not if it may be called peril, but he tells me that our arch foe, Jonathan Wild, has actually taken possession of the chambers opposite, formerly in the possession of Lord Warringdale, and that when not engaged in some of his nefa rious enterprises, he sleeps there.\" \"Oh, indeed!\" said a voice on the staircase at this moment. The row that Tom Ripon noticed was rapidly approaching, and consisted of a throng of watch men who had some one then in custody. The some one evidently would not walk, so the watchmen were carrying him in a very undignified fashion \u2014 neck and heels. \" Who is there ?\" cried Heron, looking over the balustrades. \"It's only me, Captain,\" cried Tom Ripon. \"All's right \u2014 it's only me. I've come to say that Daisy is as comfortable as possible, and if you don't want me any more, we'll just go to bed.\" \" To bed, Tom, in the morning ?\" \" Yes, Captain ; you see when a fellow's been up all night the best way is to get something to eat and drink, and persuade himself it is his supper, and then turn in.\" CHAPTER CCXV JONATHAN WILD BELIEVES HIMSELF THE VICTEV! OF SPIRITUAL. DELUSIONS. \"As you please, Tom. I don't think I shall leave the house for the next four -and-twenty hours.\" \" That'll just suit me,\" said Tom Ripon to him self as he slowly descended the staircase. \" Four and-twenty hours, the Captain says, and Jonathan Wild in the house opposite ; up to some mis chief, of course, which I'll try and thwart him in, or my name's not Tom Ripon.\" What particular scheme Tom Bapon had in his mind with respect to Jonathan Wild we shall quickly see ; but be it what it may, it was one which evidently required darkness to carry it out ; so Tom, with that chancing facility of going to sleep, which he always enjoyed, settled himself 'lown for a long rest ; and it was not until the day had passed away, and the twilight had deepened into night, that he might have been seen standing in the deep doorway of Whitcombe House, with his eyes fixed upon the chambers of Lord Warringdale opposite. No light was visible in those chambers. The centre blind of the three windows that faced the street was up, so that Tom must have seen if the chambers were tenanted by any one. But Tc.. Bipo wss persevering, and with oc- Tom Ripon shrunk back deeper still into the olu doorway as the tumult approached him ; not that he supposed it could in any manner concern him, either in advancing or retarding the object he had in view ; but Tom Ripon's life had been of that adventurous character that it had inclined him always to take as much observation of any unusual circumstance as possible. The tumult rapidly approached. The watchmen, of course, used the worse pos sible language ; and in proportion as they loaded the person whom they had iu custody with op probrious epithets, that person seemed to enjoy _i\u00bb situation. In a high, and not altogether unmusical voice, the prisoner almost overpowered the imprecations of the watchmen by singing. The song was what may be called a flash one, and was perfectly familiar to Tom Ripon. In fact, so delighted was he to hear it, that he felt quite inclined to join in the chorus which usually belongs to that class of minstrelsy. He looked out from behind the column where he was ensconced, with a broad grin of delight upon his countenance."], [117, "111 EDITH HERON. But Tom had not yet recognised whom the watchman had in custody. He was soon to do so. with the agility of a harlequin he bounded to L;s feet, \u2014 \" not if I know it, Tom Ripon ! But how, in the name of all that's wonderful, came you to be here at such a lucky moment ?\" \" I live here,\" said Tom ; \" and this is my house.\" The prisoner, however, be he whom he might, seemed to be seized with a sudden desire of giving a little more trouble than usual immediately op posite to the doorstep of Whitcombe House. It is perfectly true that two watchmen had hold of each leg, and two hold of each arm, while two more had passed their staves under the back of the refractory prisoner, and so assisted to carry him on in rather an uneasy extemporised couch, but which seemed to have about it all the elements of security. As he spoke, he gave Jack Sheppard a pull into the shadowy doorway of Whitcombe Heuse ; for. happening to cast his eyes to the opposite side of the way, he saw that one of the blinds was par tially pulled aside at a window of Lord Warring dale's late chambers, and that a face was close to the glass with a pair of fiery-looking eyes, en deavouring to look out It was but an endeavour. Despite all this, however, the prisoner managed, by a vigorous effort, to reach the ground. \" Now, cripples all '\" he shouted, \" let's have a rest !\" St. James's Street, at that period, was only lit by half-a-dozen oil lamps, and four of them were out. 'Come on, will yer?\" yelled the watchmen in chorus. The dubious kind of twilight, therefore, tha.t reigned in the placo rather confused than assisted the vision. \"Wait a bit. What's the eharge ?\" \"Didn't we see you beginning to get into tho skylight of Sir James ThornhiU's house in Pall Mall?\" And yet no doubt Jonathan Wild had heard the disturbance without, and was endeavouring to see what occasioned it. \" To be sure you did !\" \" Then come to the roundhouse like a Christian, and don't give any more trouble.\" \" But I explained.\" \" Oh, come along, do !\" \"I told you Sir James had invited me to drink a dish of chocolate.\" \" Keep close, Jack !\" whispered Tom. \" What for ? Any sneak about ?\" \" Yes. Look opposite. That's Jonathan Wild at the window !\" Jack Sheppard whistled a long, low note. \" I see him, Tom ; but I can't make all this out. You say this is your house, and ugly Johnny seems to live opposite. Why, what will Newgate Street do without the beauty ?\" \"This isn't my house,\" said Tom, \"and yet it is, if you understand that, Jack.\" \"What, at one o'clock in the morning?\" \"Yes; he's an early riser; and I don't mean to go any further till you send for him.\" Tom Ripon was delighted. Long before the dialogue had got thus far be tween the watchmen and their captive, Tom had recognised wL_ that captive was. His old friend and associate, Jack Sheppard, was the person who had been apprehended by so strong a force of the guardians of the night, while making an attempt at burglary at the house of Sir James Thonihill, the celebrated painter. Now Tom Ripon always imagined that Jack Sheppard had served him rather a scurvy trick the last time they were together ; but it was not in the nature of Tom to nurse up grievances for le sng, and he was delighted now at the opportunity of being of some assistance to his old associate, or pal, as he called him. The watchmen were no less than eight in number, so that Tom Ripon thought some sudden surprise would be the best way of aiding or assist ing Jack Sheppard. Situated as he was, he was just in a position to exeoute such a man\u0153uvre. \" It's difficult.\" \"Let it alone, then; but I suppose you're f re o to admit I got you out of that little scrape with the watch ?\" \" All's right, Tom ; and I'll do as much for you another time.*' \" You can do something now a great deal better than I can. I want to get into that house oppo site ; for come of it what may, I want to find out what Jonathan Wild is about. It's Uke enough that the doors are only on the lock, and if so, I suppose you can manage to let me in ?\" \" Of course I can, Tom, if you wish it ; but I would just as soon go into a wolf's den as into any house with Jonathan Wild.\" \"Never mind, Jack, I'U take care of myseU\". He's gone now ; so let's set about it.\" Tom Ripon and Jack Shepparai walked right down to PaU Mall, and then up Si . James's Street again on the other side of the way, until they came to the house where Jonaths a WUd was un questionably passing the night. He took a flying leap on to she shoulders of one of the watchmen, shouting out, as he did so, \" Come on, my merry men, and each tackle his man ! Hurrah ! \u2014 hurrah !\" Jack Sheppard was the most s! iUul picklock in all London, although at that s 3riod he had not obtained the celebrity which has made him almost an historical character. The effect of this sudden charge from Tom Ripon was decisive. The watchmen thought ficmselves completely beleaguered by a host of new foes, and they immediately took to flight jji aU directions. \" Well soon see, Tom, how ska matter stands,\" whispered Jack. There was a slight rattle in the key-hole of the door, and then the lock yielded. \"Come in!\" Jack Sieppard was left sprawUng on the pave ment. Tom was quite delighted with the success of Jack Sheppard, and rather surprised at the same time that the door should have been left without any fastening from within. But he was free. \" Now, Jack,\" said Tom. \"up with you, and be off.\" \"Not if I know it,\" said Jack Sheppard, as Jack explained in a whisper how that arose."], [118, "112 EDITH HERON. its socket proclaimed to Tom Ripon that his pos session of the key was of very Uttle service. \" Done again !\" said Tom. \" This won't answer.\" The night was passing away, and he felt that if he did not by some means compass his object quickly he would have to leave the house and give it up, at aU events, for the present. Fertile, however, in resources, Tom was not without another \" dodge,\" as he called it, to get the better of Jonathan WUd. He suddenly stamped violently upon the stair case, and then lurched up heavily against the door, bo that WUd could not be off hearing him. \"It's one cf these big houses, Tom, aU let out in separate chambers ; and as everybody has a key to the outer door, and nobody knows who's out and who's in, you see, it's never more than on the lock. But what are you going to do ?\" \" Take a look at Jonathan.\" Jack Sheppard shook his head. \"Rather you than I, Tom. But still, if you want a feUow to help you, and don't mind going my way to work, I'm your man !\" \" What way is that, Jack ?\" \" AVhy, if you want a comfortable interview with Jonathan Wild, you should have a knife at his throat and a pistol barrel at his ear.\" \"No, Jack, I don't Uke that. We, that is Captain Heron and I, might have settled Jonathan over and over again, if we had liked, and I'm afraid some day we may have to do it, though we don't want to cheat Tyburn tree. I've made up my mind, however, to find out what he's about here, and I'll take care of myseU, you may de pend.\" Then Tom waited the result. That result was just what he wished and ex- pected it to be. WUd was aggravated past discretion, for he had just laid down in bed again, and composed himself to rest. Dashing open the door, he made a rush out on to the landing, exclaiming, as he did so, \" Fool \u2014 beast! Who are you? Drunk, I suppose; but if you Uve here, why don't you go to your own rooms ?\" \"Good night, then, Tom. I've two cribs to crack yet before morning.\" Jack Sheppard went his way, leaving Tom in the haU of the house which contained Jonathan Wild. Jonathan Wild's impetuosity had carried him right to the head of the stairs. It could scarcely be said that Tom had any very defined idea of what he was about, except that he felt there was great danger to Captain Heron and to Edith by this close proximity of WUd to Whit combe House, aud he was willing to run consider able risk to find out exactly what the great thief taker meant by it. That was Tom Bipon's opportunity. Rapidly, upon all-fours, he made his way into WUd's rooms, and never halted until he had got into a far corner, where he squeezed himself into an incredibly small space, almost between a large old wardrobe and the wall Creeping softly up the stairs, Tom Ripon stood by the outer door of the chambers, and then he regretted that he had not detained Jack Sheppard for a short period in order that he might use his picklock on that door as weU. But fortune favoured Tom. WUd came back with a growl. \"I hate these houses,\" he said, \"that are everybody's and nobody's. You don't know what you're doing and where you are. AU night long some fool or another is coming home and making a disturbance. Ah ! I don't feel weU to-night.\" Jonathan sat down upon a chair, which creaked under him He had scarcely weU established himself on the landing when the door, close to which he was abruptly opened. .onathan WUd thrust his head out on to the dark staircase. \" I'm cold, too,\" he said ; \" and that night-Ught won't burn ; at least, it only burns enough to make darkness visible, and to people the room with aU sorts of shadows. What's that \u2014 eh? What's that ? Oh, I see ; only the clothes-horse. The corner of it just looked Uke the face ef Jerry, the magsman, who was hung at Tyburn last Monday. WeU, how could I help it ? Why didn't he pay me my dues, and he wouldn't have gone there at aU?\" \" I thought I heard a noise,\" he growled. The door very nearly struck Tom Ripon as it opened, and he had to shrink back as far as he could get to avoid the probabiUty of observation. \"I'm pretty sure I heard a noise,\" growled Jonathan WUd again. Now Torn Ripon executed a very daring nd clever feat it this moment. The night-Ught to which Jonathan WUd al luded was a Uttle floating wick in a saucer of oil, and certainly the miserable iUumination that pro ceeded from it was, as he said, only sufficient to make darkness visible. As Jonai han WUd leant out at the doorway, Tom ran h... hand up the edge of the door untU he came to the look. The key was in it. Noiselessly and adroitly Tom drew it forth, and felt that he had the means, at aU events, of letting himself into the chambers, provided WUd did not secure the do< ir by any other means on the inside. \" Bah !\" sj id Wild, after Ustening for a few moments ; \". ; suppose it was only fancy, but what have I to dr with fancy ? Bah ! Bo !\" After uttering this semi-defiance into the dark ness of the staUcase, WUd withdrew his head again and banged shut the door. Tom Ripon heard him fumbling with the lock. Then there could be no mistake about what he hid done. Aud this light, such as it was, was in an ad joining apartment, so that it was no wonder Jonathan WUd saw many shadows floating about him. Tom Ripon began to think he saw them like wise. The superstitious fears of Jonathan Wild were to a certain extent contagious. \" Confound Mm !\" said Tom. \"Wliy don't he go to bed and have done with aU this ?\" That was exactly what Wild woiUd have Uked to do if he could, but he had already been to bod, and while there some The sharp click of some weU-hung bolt into \" Dreams had come \"\u2014"], [119, "113 EDITH HERON. dreams that had shaken even the iron nerves of the king of the thief-takers. seen Lord Warringdale to-day, and he, I think, in reaUty Ues, or ought to Ue, at the bottom of the tide of the old Thames.\" Resting his head upon his hands as he sat in the dark room, Wild still muttered to himself, \" I cannot make it out. What was it the man said in the play the other night ? That his eyes were something wrong, or else worth all the rest of his senses put together. Yes, that was it. WeU, that is just the case with my eyes. I have either seen Felix Heron or I have not. If I have not, why, then, I am a little mad ; and if I have, my eyes are worth all my other senses. But he is dead \u2014 dead ! Am I not well aware that he is dead ?\" Wild now uttered a series of most dismal groans that Tom Ripon was delighted to hear. \"SolAp!\" thought Tom Ripon. \"You meant to settle rm_ too, Johnny, did you? WeU, I can forgive you that.\" \" And what is the meaning of it aU ?\" added Jonathan WUd, after a few moments' sUence. \" What is the meaning of it aU ? Can it be pos sible that when they are near their own \u2014 depar ture \" \u2014 Jonathan WUd had a great disUke to use the word death, in relation to himseU, \u2014 \"can it be possible that they then begin to have glimpses of that world beyond the grave, to which they are hastening ?\" \" Well,\" thought Tom, \" Johnny is coming it to-night! He beats Mortification aU into fits, for that's something the sort of way that old boyused to go on in.\" \u2022' Well, well,\" he added after a long pause, \"it useless to think of such things. But they thicken around me, I say \u2014 they thicken around tne : for U I am not much mistaken, I have likewise \u00a3\u00bb- \"I seem,\" added Jonathan, \"as if I were im- Edith. \u2014 No. 67."], [120, "114 EDITH HERON. opening his eyes and looking him full in the face. pelled to Uve in this house, so that from its windows I may see the ghost of FeUx Heron upon the doorstep of the ancient abode of his race; and here, in these chambers, surely is the best pos sible chance that I may be visited by the appari tion of Lord Warringdale. I'll go to bed.\" \"Ah, do!\" whispered Tom. \" I wiU go to bed, but I wiU put my pistols under my pUlow handy, and woe be to any one of mortal mould who disturbs me ! To-morrow morning I wiU make my way into Whitcombe House, and I will know who this mysterious man, who calls himself tho Baron Von Peck, really is, or the widowed Countess shall rue it.\" Tom did not speak, but, mentaHy, he gave him- BeU up for lost ; and he bitterly regretted he had not brought fire-arms with him, so that, at the worst, it might be a Use for a life. Jonathan WUd must have been only half awake, and in that dreamy condition which only con founds reaUties with the visions of sleep. He did not seem greatly surprised at seeing Tom Ripon by his bedside, but rather gazed at him with a look of half-sleeping curiosity. \"Another of them !\" he said in a low, moaning voice. \" I suppose something's happened to that boy, and he's dead, too, or he wouldn't be here \u2014 he couldn't be.\" \" Oh, that's the Uttle game, is it?\" thought Tom. Jonathan WUd, groaning and sighing as he went, repaired to the inner room, and cast himseU on.the bed. Tom Bipon quietly crept out of his hiding place. Tom Bipon took the hint in a moment. He was to play his own ghost Jonathan WUd having seen, as he supposed, tho apparitions of persons whom he thought he knew to be dead, was content to beUeve that the Uving, breathing Tom Bipon must be a ghost like wise. On tip-toe he went towards the doer of com munication, and listened. Jonathan Wild was breathing heavily. To\u00bb peeped in at the door. The night light surely burnt a Uttle brighter than ordinary, for Tom Ripon was able to see pretty weU about him in that apartment, which had bean luxuriously furnished by Lord Warring dale as his own bedchamber. Tom kept up the delusion very weU. He had an impression on his mind that ghost. ought to disappear, as he had seen theatrical ones do at the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, merely by going through a trapdoor perpendicularly. He managed this very weU. DoubUng up his legs under him, Tom slowly sunk lower and lower by the bedside of Jonathar WUd, until he got right down to the floor, and then, as quietly as he could, be crept under the bed. Wild lay huddled up in the bed, and unless he were actually counterfeiting a deep sleep, which 'here seemed no inducement whatever lor him to do, he ee_t\u00abinly had fallen into one. \" AIT s right !\" said Tom. With the noiseless, stealthy step of a cat, Tom Ripon made his way to the bedside of Jonathan WUd. Jonathan followed the descent of Tom with wondering eyes ; and when he disappeared below the edge of the bed, WUd slowly raised himself up so as to catch the last glimpse of him. \" Gone !\" said WUd. Now, had Toss Bipon suddenly come in from the Ught of a weU-Ul uminated room into that dark some chamber, he would probably have not been able to distinguish one objeotfrom another ; but as it was, his eyes ihad become accustomed to the semi-twUight, and he saw everything distinctly. He crept close up to the bed head- With his hand to his ear be listened again. Yes, there could be no doubt about it\u2014 -Jonathan WUd, the man of many crimes, who was hastening to the end of his career, slept ! He leant his head and face over the ojge of the bed completely ; but, of course, nothing was to he seen of Tom Ripon. \" Yea,\" added Wild, \" that's another of them. I suppose by degrees I shaU see everybody that I've known in life looking into my eyes in death, and trying to scare me from my senses. What does he want here ? I didn't lriU him, nor did I stir hand or foot to contrive his death !\" A dim sort of suspicion seemed to come across the mind of Jonathan WUd that, after all, ho might be the victim of some trick or delusion. He crept softly out of bed. But Tom Bipon heard him. The possibUity that the appearance he had seen might be real, and that his tormenting enemy, Tom Ripon, be really present, presented itself .to Wild's mind. CHAPTER CCXVI TOM RIPON BARGAINS WITH WHJ3 FOR THE SAFETY OF THE BARON VON PECK. Tom was not unmindful of the declaration of Jonathan that he had put his pistols under the pillow. In fact, unless he had been quite insane, it could scarcely fail to do so. Jonathan WUd stooped down and looked under the bed. The possession of them, therefore, became a matter of the first necessity. That they were there, as Wild had stated, Tom did not doubt for a moment; but although ho looked down aa closely as he dared, yet he did not see them. But Tom was not to b3 caught so easUy as that, for he had crawled out at the other side, and was round the foot of it by that time. U any one could have looked into that chamber with but a sb'ght sense of the ludicrous, the man\u0153uvres of Tom Ripon and Jonaiicn WUd certainly must have excited laughter. WUd crept right under the bed and out at the other side, even as Tom had done ; but by that limo Tom was round the bedstead again, and He suspected that, although Wild breathed heavily, he slept lightly. But -rrhUe Tom was considering what to do, ho was, certainly, with all bis coolness and non chalance, terrified at tho fact of WUd suddenly"], [121, "115 EDITH HERON. ma_dn\u00bb his way under it for the second time, so that WK misfjed him. \"\u2022Scoundrel !\" \"Now. don't be railing yourself names, Jolmny !\" \" No.\" muttered WUd, \"there is no one here ; and perhaps, after all, it was merely fancy.\" He crept into bod again. \"Botherit!\" wh'_p_red Tom to himself. \"Why can't he go to sleep quietly, and let a feUow get his pistols.\" Tom waited for some time before he again ven tured to rise up again in a ghost-like fashion by the bedside. Wild showed a imposition to get out of the bed. \"Stop a lit!\" cried Tom. \"H you move an other inch, over you go ! Pm a f eUow of my word, and mean what I say !\" WUd suspected that such was the case. \" What elo yoa want ?\" he growled. \" That's just what I want to know of yon. What do you want, Johnny, and why do you come prying about here, and peeping and spying at Whitcombe House, as though you'd Uke to eat up our jjdith, eh ?\" \" Oh, that's it !\" said WUd. \" You're 6ent over to question me, are you ?' Wild slept again. This getting in and out of bed, however, had had the effect of displacing the pUlows ; so that, to his great satisfaction, Tom Ripon saw the heavy, brass-mounted butt-ends of a pair of pis tols fully in view. \" That wiU do '.\" he whispered. Very cautiously he drew cut the pistols one after another. Sa_ I ain't!\" Ike. '.ere you are!\" \" I wasn't sent ; I came of my own accord !\" \"Bah!'' WUd did not stir. Tom took a glance at the weapons, and saw that they were f uUy loaded, with plenty of powder in the pans, and good sharp flints. CarefuUy moving a chair, then, to a distance of about two feet from the bedside. Tom knelt upon it and resting the pistols upon its back, the muzzles were both conveniently presented to wards Jonathan WUd. \" What do yon want, Johnny ? Out with it at once ; and if I don't Uke it, over you go !\" .\" You're a charming youth !\" \" That's what aU the gals say. But I don't want any compliments from you, because, you see, of the difficulty of returning them ! Come, Johnny, what's your Uttle game here?\" \" Put down those pistols.\" \" Oh, dear, no ! My old master, Captain Heron, used to count three when a feUow was obstinate and wouldn't answer him a civU ques tion ; and ii he went on being obstinate after that, over he went ! Now, Johnny, what do you want here? One!\" \"I rather think that'U do,\" said Tom. \"H Jonathan is tired of the world, he has only to say so, and bang, pop, and away he goes !\" Tom Bipon did not think it at all necessary to be cautious as to the tone of voice he used now ; and there could be no doubt that WUd did par tiaUy hear him in his sleep. The great thief-taker moved uneasUy. One \u2014 two\u2014 __ree! struck the Palace dock at St. James's. \" What's that to you ?\" \" Two !\" \" Stop ! What is the use of throwing away a life upon a heedless wretch such as you ane ? I want to know who and what that Boron Von Peck is, and why he's so continually going in and out Whitoombe House.\" \" It's getting late,\" said Tom. \" I must wake him up.\" Tom gathered a long breath, and then shouted out \" Hoy, hoy ! Johnny ! Lots o' ghosts, and to spare!\" WUd sprung up to a silting posture in the bed with a yeU of dismay. -\u2022 That'U do !\" cried Tom. \"'Now, how do you feeL old 'un ? Just open both eyes as wide as you can.\" \"Is that all?\" said Tom. \"It is, for the present\" \"Well, then, you must knew, Johnny, missus is a widow, and the Baron ain't bad-looking.\" . Oh, that's it, is it ? Ah ! I might havo suspected it ! But stUl there's a mystery about the feUow which I must fathom. I cannot take my Lord Clackington's gold for nothing.\" \" Now, look you here, Johnny,\" said Tom. \" I like the Baron, and so do we all. Now, if you won't promise to let him alone, I won't leave this room without sending the contents of these pis tols into your head ! It's nothing to you who or what he is, so don't you interfere ! Come, now, is it a bargain?\" \"Tom Bipon '.\" \" Here you are, Johnny !\" \" I once made to you a proposal to come into my service : I make it you again.\" \"Don't; it's a waste of time! I've got ten pound a year and my victuals with the Countess of Whitcombe; and the Baron Von Peck says that if everything goes right, and he marries her, hell make it guineas. What do you say to that, Johnny ?\" \"I say that you shaU have from me (en guineas a month, and whatever you can pick up bs-ides.\" WUd uttered an imprecation. He thrust one hand beneath the pUlow for the pistols. \"Oh, yon must look a Uttle further for them,\" said Tom. \" Here they are.\" He rattled the barrels of the pistols on the back of the chair as he spoke, to the imminent danger of their explosion ; for those old flint and steel fire-arms either would never go off at all, or did so with an alarming facUity. WUd began to get wide awake. He began to comprehend his situation. \"You young villain!\" he cried. \"What do you want here ?\" \u2022' Don't speak in that way to a respectable ghost\" said Tom. \u2022\u2022Ghost?\" \" Yes. Don't I look like one ? But however that may be, Johnny, youTl be one in a brace of shakes if you don't mind ? What's in these pis tols? Bullets, buttons, old nails, or siug3, or what?\" \" It's of no use. I've told you what I want"], [122, "116 EDITH HERON. Tom Bipon was only half awake, but he became conscious that two figures were in the stable, one on each side of him. \"HUloa!\" he cried, \"what are you bringing in now ?\" and what I mean. Come, Johnny, make up your mind, and don't let's have any more fuss about it ! WUl you promise never in any way to interfere with the Baron Von Peck, or will you rather that I should puU the triggers of these two pistols, and so do the job completely ?\" \"Very well, I promise !\" \"Now, Johnny, I've heard you say you'U do things, and I beUeve, then, you always try to do them ; so I think, when you say you won't do a thing, you ought to stick by that ; and I'U trust you for once, though I suppose I'm about the first that ever reaUy did. There's your pistols, Johnny.\" \" Oh, Tom, are you reaUy awake ?\" said Mrs. Bipon, \u2014 for she was one of the persons there present. \" Why, it's the old gal !\" said Tom. \" Yea,\" said the other figure, \" as the Psalmist says, let the sluggard arise. Yea, we have some thing to communicate ; and as, further on, tho Psalmist justly remarks, if you have any swag to sell \u2014 no, I don't mean that \u2014 but even the Psalmist himseU promised if he had haU-a-dozen silver spoons or a candlestick, he would feel it his duty to deal with his relations.\" \"What the deuce are you driving at?\" said Tom to Mortification. \" What do you mean by coming and waking a fellow up about Psalmists, and candlesticks, and sUver spoons.\" \" Oh ! my dear Tom,\" said Mrs. Ripon, patting her eyes with her handkerchief, \u2014 \"we are aU sinful.\" To the surprise of WUd, Tom Bipon got off the chair and handed him his two pistols with the butt-ends towards him. \" Is this possible,\" said WUd, \" that, threaten ing me bo recently as you have done, you now place your lUe in my hands ?\" \"Oh, dear, no!\" said Tom. \"Haven't you promised ?\" \" And you wUl take my word ?\" \" I have !\" \" I beUeve you, old gal ! \u2014 only some of us is a Uttle worse than others. What's up now, old gal eh?\" WUd was sUent for a few seconds. A struggle between the faint and long since trodden-down good that might be even in his nature, and the thoughts of evil and treachery that were familiar to him, was taking place. Tom Ripon was in great danger. Almost a feather's weight, either way, would turn the scale for life or for death. \"Yea, I wiU explain,\" said Mortification, \u2014 \" I wUl explain to Thomas. Your sainted and respectable parent, Thomas, along with the humble individual who stands in the relation of father-in-law to you, thinks of going into the old line of business. The fearless, open look that Tom bent upon Wild's face, had, however, its effect. The thief-taker handed back the pistols to Tom. \"Oil, I see!\" said Tom Bipon \u2014 \"set up a fence again.\" \" Yea, you may caU it a fence.\" \" Oh, Tom !\" added Mrs. Bipon ; \" in this vale of tears we're aU bound to be useful as far as we can ; and as the Captain goes on tho road again now, and you with him, we thought you might as weU deal with us as with any other thie \" \" Put them on that table over there,\" he said. \" I shan't want them to-night.\" \"All's right, Johnny !\" \"Bah! bo! Be off!\" \"You'll keep your word?\" \" I will, and as you got in here you can get out. But look ye here, Tom Bipon , join me, and I'U make it twenty guineas a month, and I'll promise that you shaU name who you Uke never to be interfered with by me, come what may.\" \" Not for twenty thousand, Johnny ! So good night !\" Jonathan WUd, with a growl, pulled the bed clothes over him ; and Tom Bipon, very weU satis fied with the night's adventure, left the chambers and went over to Whitcombe House. Mortification coughed. \" Thieves, you mean,\" said Tom. \" And so,\" added Mrs. Ripon, taking no notice whatever of the interruption, \u2014 \" and so, my dear boy, we have taken a Uttle shop in Wardour Street, Soho, where we seU needles and tape.\" \" And thimbles and stay-laces,\" said Mortifica tion. \" And buttons, and hooks and eyes,\" added Mis. Bipon. \" Yea, and tracts,\" said Mortification. \"That'U do,\" cried Tom; \"I know aU about it : the shop's a blind, the back parlour's a fence, and there's a melting pot in the kitchen.\" \"Yea, as the Psalmist says, wisdom's head groweth on young shoulders. That is just it. Ready money and no favours.\" \" It's a pity,\" said Mrs. Ripon as she settled hor cap, \"to stagnate in this world; and if the Captain sticks to business, why shouldn't we ?\" \" Why, look ye here,\" said Tom ; \" there's not a soul, old gal, in this great old Whitcombe House but is an old friend or acquaintance of the Captain and Edith's, and there ain't too many of us now. There's Ogle and Mrs. Ogle, and that young girl, who was never so pretty tUl the other one came; and then there's myseU and you two; and now you want to be off.\" \"Yea, aUwil1 be well,\" said Mortification, \"and your saintod mother wUl caU occasionaUy, Thomas, Tom slept, as usual in the stable with Daisy, and he debated with himself long and anxiously whether or not he should inform Captain Heron of the Uttle adventure he had had with Jonathan WUd. After debating the matter pro and con for some time in bis own mind, he determined not to do so. Tom was so extremely fond of engaging in these little personal adventures, and he was, at the same time, so reluctant to do anything opposed to the orders of Captain Heron, that he feared a general prohibition might issue against his engaging in any such matters. \" No,\" he said, as the bright sunUght came into his eyes and wakened him in the morning, \u2014 \"no, I won't say anything to the Captain about it ; and if Jonathan Wild only keeps his word, it wiU be a job well dono; and so\u2014 \u2014Eh? what's this?

But, I teU you what, old 'un, I won't consent, except on one condition.\" \" Eh ?\" said Mrs. Ripon. \" What do you mean by caUing me old 'un, you wretched Uttle badger.\" \" Is a man to be insulted,\" said Tom, \" and be called a badger ?\" \" You odious boy ; you think nothing of break ing your mother's head and heart, both.\" \" Peace, peace!\" cried Mortification, waving his hands up and down, as though he were trying to mesmerise both Tom and his mother. \"Peace, peace ! Let me pour oU upon the troubled waters ; yea \" you see, Tom, you can't have her, so there's an end of it ; and remember to have Daisy saddled, and your own horse likewise, ready at eight o'clock to-night. I have a desire to visit that old mansion that belonged to my dear old friend and protector of my early days, Sir Dominick Browue ; and wo may possibly meet with some adventures by the way.\" CHAPTER CCXVII. CAPTAIN HERON AND TOM MEET WITH A REAL GHOST ADVENTURE. It was eight o'clock. Flying showers and a blustering wind pervaded London. \" If you pour any oil on me,\" said Tom, \" 111 pretty soon settle you. And I teU you what it is, mother; I'U not only consent to you opening a crib such as you speak off, but 111 deal with you, on one condition ; and that is, that you take good care that, night and day, there shall be good accom modation for me, for Daisy, and the Captain, if we are hard pressed.\" \" Yea,\" said Mortification, \" we have the whole house ; and we pretend to let it out in lodgings, but we don't, so that the accommodation is ample ; and you, and Daisy, and the Captain are welcome at any time to come and get up the chimney of any of the rooms.\" This was too much for Tom's patience. He scrambled to his feet, and seized a hay-fork, on which the Rev. Mortification and bis mother precipitately retreated. Tom Ripon had been forced to get over his lovo disappointment as best he might. But his feelings, lacerated as they might be, did not prevent him from being quite ready with Daisy and his own horse, at the comer of Pall Mall, precisely as the Palace clock struck the hour named by FeUx Heron. Tom Ripon feU in love very easUy, and such a facUity for the tender passion generaUy brings with it an equal facility of falling out of love again. If any one had remarked Tom particularly, as, mounted on his own horse, and leading Daisy by the bridle, he slowly moved up and down by Marlborough House, they might have recognised the air that Tom was whistUng. It was a remarkably consolatory one for a dis appointed lover : \u2014 Probably they had attained aU their object by letting Tom Ripon know that they were tired of the inactive life at Whitcombe House, and were going into the old line of business as feneekeepers again. \" Well,\" soIUoquised Tom, as he performed a hasty toUet, \" let them go \u2014 we don't want them, Daisy ; but I must tell the Captain aU about it. And who knows but what it's aU for the best ? \u2014 for since we do go out on the road again, we may have the Philistines after us, hard and fast, some night, and be glad to take refuge at the crib in Wardour Street, though not in the chimney.\" FeUx Heron did not stir from Whitcombe House for the whole of that day, so Tom easUy had an opportunity of communicating to him the defection of his mother and Mortification from the household. \" What care I how fair she be. If she smile not upon me.\" \"Yes,\" said Tom, in a low tone, \"she is a pretty girl ; but it's no use making a fuss about it, and I think I'U go back to the t'other one now, for fear she should break her heart, poor thing ! Oh, there's the Captain !\" Felix Heron, in his costume as the Baron Von Peck, approached, and Ughtly vaulted into Daisy's saddle. \" Come on, Tom,\" he said. \" The night is clearing, and the roads wiU be in capital condi tion.\" \" AU's right, Captain.\" Felix Heron, closely foUowed by Tom Eipou, trotted up St. James's Street, and, turning sharp to the left, took their course towards the Western Road. \"Let them go, Tom,\" he said. \" We shaU do well enough ; and I've some idea that the young Marquis of Ormond wiU take up his abode in this house, for he is much alone in the world, and has scarcely a friend or relation Uving. Next week he wUl be united to Marianna. \" They were far from being whoUy unobserved, for Jonathan WUd had left one of his men as a spy in St. James's Street, who was to bring him information of the outgoings and incomings of the Baron Von Peck. Tom staggered back till he stumbled over a chair, and then sat on the floor with it in his lap, looking in speechless horror at Heron. \" Ma-r-ried ?\" This man ran off at once to Newgate Street with his information ; and, in haU an hour's time, WUd was knocking at the door of Whitcombe House. \" Yes, Tom.\" \"ToMa-ri-an-na?' \" Exactly so ; and a chamiing young couple they wiU make !\" \"Brimstone and blazes !\" It was a strange business for such a man as Jonathan WUd to come to Whitcombe House upon ; but the fact is, he had resolved to warn Edith of the sort of man he believed the Baron to be. \"Why, what's the matter ?\" \" I wanted her myseU.\" \" Oh, that's it !\" said Heron, cpoUy. WeU, It would be difficult to analyze the kind of"], [124, "118 EDITH HERON. friendly feehng that Jonathan WUd had towards Edith since the supposed death of Felix Heron. He was, as we have frequently said, eminently superstitious. , \" Bah !\" cried WUd ; \" be quiet. And as for you, madam, since you wiU have it that I should speak out, I teU you that I've heard something of you that vexes me !\" \"Of me?\" It is possible enough, then, that an element of fear entered into thc feeling, and that by holding a protecting hand ove Edith he might supposo he was in Bome manner propitiating the spirit of Felix Heron. \"Yes; your husband was a brave and noble gentleman, though he and I were generally at loggerheads ! He was not a man to forget ! But yet it seems you're about to change your state, and marry a certain Baron Von Peck.\" Edith and Ogle exchanged glances. \" Yes,\" added WUd ; \" I'm told as much, upon veiy good authority. Now, I tell you the fellow is a rascal; one of those scamps in the pay of the biggest rogue of all, something after the fashion of my Lord Clackington ; and what you can see in him aU of you I can't imagine, for he seems to have bewitched you aU alike !\" \" No, no,\" cried Edith ; \" he is but a friend.\" \" I know better ! You have even let him have FeUx Heron's mare Daisy; and he is off with that scamp Tom Ripon on the road to-night. Cast him off, I say, Countess of Whitcombe !\" Edith and Ogle again exchanged glances. These odd looks of inteUigence did not escape Jonathan WUd. Certain it is that he had a very bad opinion of the Baron Von Peel: ; and his errand, on this oc casion, to Whitcombe House was to let Edith know it. WUd gave a brief nod to Ogle, who opened the door. \" Is tho Countess within ?\" he asked. \"Mr. Wild, what do you want here?\" said Ogle. \" This is no place for you aud me at the same time !\" \" Pooh, pooh ! With the death of FeUx Heron let onr animosities cease. I am willing to forget the past so long as you keep your present position as a faithful servant of the Countess of Whit combe, whom I now want to see upon as friendly an errand as even you cou'. think of!\" Ogle was somewhat surprised at this altered tone on the part of Jonathan WUd; but there was only one of two things to do with such a man. \" \"What can aU this mean ?\" he asked himseU. \" There is something going on that I don't at aU comprehend, but that I ought. Well,\" he added, after the pause of a few seconds, \" I can do no more thanwam you. H the saying is a good and a true one, that a wilful man wUl have his own way, it is a great deal more true of a woman !\" With this speech, which Jonathan WUd thought to be, and meant to be, a particularly sharp one, he turned, and left the house. Then Ogle laughed. But the heart of Edith was too heavy to permit her to do so. Either to kill him or to temporise with him. Ogle felt, too, that the conservation of the secret of Felix Heron's continued existence was of the first importance. He spoke fairly to Wild. \" Fm as willing to forget as you are ; and any service you can render to the Countess of Whit combe wiU lay up in my mind gratitude instead of animosity. Tell me what you want to say to her, Mr. Wild, and, as a living man, I will repeat it!\" \" Ah, Ogle !\" she said, \" I don't know where aU these alarms and mysteries are to end !\" \" They wUl all end well, you may depend, my lady,\" said Ogle ; \" for I would back the Captain and Daisy against the world !\" With a sigh, Edith made her way to her own rooms. \" No. I must see her, if it be but for a mo ment. Ogle hesitated. That hesitation, however, was cut short by Edith herself, who happened to be iu one of the rooms npon the ground floor of tho mansion, and overheard aU that had passed. She stepped out into the hall, and presented herself abruptly to Wild. \" What is it, Jonathan WUd, you have to say to mo?' Jonathan WUd stood for a few minutes at the corner of ' Pall Mall, and considered. \" What shaU I do ?\" he said. He clasped his hands behind him, and sauntered to and fro. WUd took off his hat with involuntary respect, and presented his round, buUet-lookmg head, with its short cropped hair, and various ugly seams and patches upon it, arising from the many deadly encounters he had been engaged in. \" I would speak with you, madam, and alone.\" \"No,\" rephed Edith. \"You can say nothing that I would wish to keep from so faithful a friend and servant as Ogle.\" \" Very well,\" said WUd. \" Look here !\" He placed his linger upon a deep scar upon his brow. His brows were knit, and he was evidently in a state of deep cogitation about something that interested him much. \"Yes,\" he said, at length, \u2014 \"yes, I wUl bo after him !\" He took a small whistle from his waistcoat pocket, ajid blew upon it shrilly. A man darted out of a deep, shadowy door way, just at the corner of St. James's Street. \" Is that you, Wilkins ?\" \" Yes, Mr. WUd.\" \"Run on as fast as you can to Volckman's stables, and get ready the dark bay mare.\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild.\" The janissary, for such he was, of Jonathan Wild ran on up St James's Street. \"Wild slowly followed him, and as he went he muttered to himself, \" There is a something in aU this that I don't yet quite comprehend, but I wiU do my best to do so to-night. The fellow has \"This was given to mo by your late husband, Felix Heron, the Earl of Whitcombe ; but it was in fair fight, and I boar no animosity to him or to bis now !\" \"It's of little use,\" said Ogle, \"bearing ani mosity to a man who is dead and gone ; but if you havo any quarrel still with the Captain, and choose to fight it out with me \""], [125, "EDITH HERON. 119 gone ont upon the Western Road ; and whether he is a highwayman or a Court spy, it is my business, as weU as my pleasure, to find out.\" The horses that Jonathan WUd was in the habit of riding were always kept, for convenience of getting at readUy, at various places-in London. Indeed, there was hardly a thoroughfare out of the City where, at some stable or another, Jona than WUd kad not a horse waiting for him. It is said in contemporary history that he was not a good horseman, and that he was always tumbling off bis steed. But, if that was the case, he contrived to tumble on again quickly, and be none the worse. There is a kind of luck in riding. One man wiU ride aU his Use and be thrown fifty times, and wiU hunt in the most difficult counties and come to no harm. put his horee to a haU gaUop until he reached a turnpike gate. That gate, which has now been abolished for many years, was within a few hundred paces of the commencement of the Green Park. \" Hflloa ! Gate \u2014 gate !\" cried WUd. Tho night was by no means far advanced, but the gate was closed, for the traffic along PiocadUly after sunset was not above one in a thousand car riages and horsemen that are now to be seen, up to long past midnight, in that populous thorough fare. \"Gate \u2014 gate!\" The gate-keeper flung the bar open. \" Threepence. Threepence for a horee.\" \"Stuff!\" said WUd. \"Hold up your lantern, man, and look at me !\" \" Oh, Mr. WUd, I beg your pardon, sir ! I didn't know you ! It's so precious dark here since they've moved the street lamp to the corner of Albemarle Street, that I can seldom see any body!\" \" Who has passed through the gate lately ?\" \" Let me see ! A man and a boy, both weU mounted.\" Another wUl break bis neck in a trot round his own lawn. It is fate ! By the time WUd reached the stables he had made mention of, a dark brown, tall, long-legged vicious-looking brute of a mare was ready saddled and bridled for him at the gate. \" That wiU do,\" he said. \" ShaU I foUow you, Mr. WUd ?\" asked the janissary. \"No.\" \" Ah ! that wiU do ! Good night !\" \"Good night, Mr. Wild; and when you're hung, which I hope wiU be soon, may I be there to see !\" added the gatekeeper, so soon as he thought WUd was fairly out of hearing. Jonathan knew perfectly weU that the dread of his name would be quite sufficient to procure him every information as to the road the Baron Ton Peck and Tom Ripon had taken. His only dread was to overshoot his mark, and pass them upon the road, in consequence of then taking some turning of which he was not aware. He went, therefore, at an easy trot, pulling up at intervals to question either some stray watch man, or to ehout out his inquiries at some road side hostel. The man walked away at ouce. Jonathan WUd scrambled on to the back of thc vicions-looking mare, and then, holding the bridle loosely on his arm, he took his pistols from his pockets and carefully examined the primings. \"AU's right!\" He thrust them into the vacant holster-cases on oach side of the saddle. \" That wiU do,\" he muttered. \"We shaU see if the Baron, who is, no doubt, some rascaUy German, is proof against a good British bullet !\" That Jonathan WUd was now, in his odd and strange way, actuaUy, as he thought, in the in terests of Edith, there can be no doubt. He had since the death, as he supposed, of Cap tain Heron, taken Edith, so to speak, under his protection. He had always admired her. Her beauty ! Her courage I Her unflinching endurance of misfortuno ; and the wonderful manner in which, throngh good re port and bad report, she had clung to her husband, had extorted the admiration of the great thief taker, WUd. And he had made up his mind that if he could possibly help it, she should not throw herself away upon such a man as the Baron Von Peck. But Edith seemed to be obstinate. But we mast leave Jonathan WUd on what may be termed the traU of Captain Heron and Tom Ripon, whUe we rejoin those two important personages of our story as they make their way towards the Western Road. It was necessary to go considerably to the right in order to reach the part of the country to which they were bound. Upon reaching the environs of Knightsbridge, Captain Heron slackened the pace of Daisy in order that Tom might come up to him \" I think, Tom,\" he said, \" that if we ride on we shaU find a bridle-path by the side of Holland House that wiU lead us to the high road We wish to be upon.\" \" To be sure, Captain ! It's called the Haunted Path.\" \"Women always are,\" said Wild. The only way, then, to settle the whole affair was to forbid the marriage in a way that would be certainly effectual. A pistol shot would do it. And it was with the express idea of this that WUd now sought the Western Road, mounted on that wn-y, vicious-looking horse, which he knew, with aU its apparent ill-condition, would carry him weU and safely almost any distance he re quired. \" Is it 60 ?\" \" Oh, yes, Captain ! You know HoUand House is deserted now ; and they do say that there's a ghost on horseback who rides up and down that path, and that everybody he passes is sure to meet with some iU luck !\" \" What nonsense, Tom !\" \" Well, it may be, Capteiu ; and at all events you and I, I'm thinking, are a match for a single ghost !\" \" I presume so, Tom ; and if the ghost should cross our path, perhaps we may try what power a b-iUet has in laying the spectre !\" Jonathan turned sharp round to the left upon reaching the top of St. James's Street, and then"], [126, "120 EDITH HERON. \" That'll do it, Captain ! I know the entrance to tho shaelowy path well enough ; it leads us right out close to the foot of N.itting Hill, aud we shall come upon it now in about three or four minutes at the Dace we're going.'! \"AU right, Tom!\" Captain Heron could not but observe, though, that Tom Ripon kept sedidously in the rear as they neared the bridle-path by the side of Holland House. Captain Heron reduced the pace of Daisy to <\". quiet walk. Tom Bipon foUowed him close at hand, and sot a few minutes not a word was spoken. But the sUence was irksome to Tom. It seemed rather to increase the gloomy and suspicious character of the place. \" Captain,\" he said, \" did you ever come down here before ?\" \"I think I must have done so; but I dun't quite recollect.\" And, indeed, but for the presence of Heron, of whose capacity to fight and conquer anything, either mortal or immortal, Tom had the highest opinion, he would certainly have been shy of passing down that reputedly haunted grove after sunset. \" WeU, Captain, of course a feUow isn't afraid ; but I don't mind saying that the sooner I get out of this place the better I shall be pleased.\" \" Hush, Tom !\" \" Goodness gracious ! You don't hear anything, Captain ?\" \" I thought I did.\" \"What was it?\" The suburb of London in which Captain Heron and his faithful foUower now were was much more rural than at present. The tide of fashion had not yet set in that direction. \" Be quiet, and we may hear it again.\" Captain Heron brought Daisy to a standstill, and Tom Bipon with his horee foUowed the example. The stiUness of the bridle-path in which they were was so profound, that it would seem that even the fall of a leaf would have been heard. Before they reached Holland House, therefore, instead of the rows of trim residences that are to be seen at present lining each side of the way with their unpicturesque frontages, there were taU trees and hedgerows, with here and there a garden wall. \" It's nothing,\" said Heron. \" Oh, dear no !\" responded Tom, \" it's nothing. Let's push on, Captain ; or, if you think it's nearer to go back, I should say that's the best way.\" \" No ; hush ! There it is again.\" Tom, as well as Captain Heron, this time heard a strange, low, waUing sound, that they could com pare to nothing human, although it was quite possible it might have been ..rtificiaUy produced by human Ups. \" Cajitain ! Captain ! What is it ?\" whispered Tom. \" Here we are !\" cried Tom. \" I know the spot by these immense elm trees that grow on each side and meet overhead, making such a thick canopy that you may take shelter under it in the smartest summer shower you can ever meet with.\" CHAPTER CCXVIIL JONATHAN WILD PURSUES THE BARON VON PECK ON THE WESTERN ROAD. \" I don't know yet.\" \" Let's go ! Let's go _' \" Ouite the contrary, Tom. You ask me what this sound is, and I cannot tell you ; but I'm quite sure I know its object.\" \"What? What?\" Black, dreary, and indistinct as the mouth of a cavern, was this bridle-road by the side of Hol land House, which had existed doubtless ever since the palatial abode had been buUt. Tom shrunk back a Uttle. To scare us out of this bridle-path, and im plant in our minds a fixed determination never to come into it again.\" \" I don't want to come into it again,\" said Tom. \" Hem ! Captain !\" he said. \" WelL Tom ?\" \" It has just struck me that U we ride half a mile further on there is a better road stiU.\" \" Oh, this wiU do very weU,\" said Heron. He turned Daisy's head towards the shadowy entrance of the lane, U lane, indeed, it could be caUed ; for although three horeernen might pos sibly, by riding close together, have passed down it abreast, no carriage of ordinary width of wheels could possibly have made its way between the taU, banked-up hedgerow on one side, and the massive substantial wall of the garden of HoUand House on the other. \" Be quiet, and foUow me. I think we are about half-way through it by this time.\" Captain Heron put Daisy to a walk, and nothing was heard for some minutes but the soft hollow tread of the horses' feet upon the damp, ill-made and UI -kept bridle-path, where thc faUen leaves of many an autumn were aUowed to lie and decom pose, forming an elastic, spongy surface, which, being never visited by thc most wandering ray of sunUght, retained its moisture all the year round. \" Halt !\" cried a voice, suddenly. That waU, too, was so overgrown with ivy that its actual construction was completely hidden. Captain Heron pulled up at once. Tom Bipon uttered an exclamation of dismay. They both looked about them \u2014 if the useless attempt to penetrate with human eyesight the darkness of that place could be called looking about \u2014 but not the smallest indication of the pre sence of any one could bo observed. \" Halt !\" cried the voice again. When Captain Heron had first heard this sum mons to come to a stand-still, he had been puz zled to know in which direction to look for it It looked like a mass of vegetation. And here and there trees, which had been planted as young saplings, and no doubt intended to be trimmed into some comely shape on the garden side of the waU, had outgrown all con trol. Stretching their limbs and branches for Ught, air, and warmth, right over the roadway, they added largely to the gloom of the bridle-path."], [127, "121 EDITH HE110I Now he felt certain it came from towards the for companionship ; and as Captain Heron and Tom Ripon both looked up at the reflected hght above the garden wall, they saw that it revealed the outlines of a human figure. What costume the figeire wore \u2014 or, indeed, whether it were male or female \u2014 could not be ob served ; but the same voice that had cried \" Halt ! \" called out in high, wailing accents, \" Sacred to the memory of tho mui'dered!

The report of the pistol in that solitary spot, so quiet and full of peace and serenity, and ap parently so completely abandoned to repose, ware startling in the extreme.

That was in the direction of HoUand House But aU doubt \u2014 not only as regarded the direc tion from whence the sound came, but also in re spect of the person who uttered it \u2014 seemed about to be put to an end.

But its reflection in the dim, dark atmosphere spread for some yards around a particular spot. Tbat particular spot seemed to be about three feet above the top of the waU bounding the gar den cf Holland House. Tom Ripon involuntarily laid his hand upon the neck of Daisy.

It's out of the question, Captain : don't ask me.\" Aud Tom Eipon, whose eyes and whole atten tion were directed to t-hs mysterious figure on the wall, was so startled by the unexpected re port, that he echoed it with a shout. And whether it was Tom's shout or Captain Heron's pistol that produced the effect might be a matter of doubt, but the ghost certainly, if it were a ghost, abruptly disappeared. The faint light on the top of the waU va nished, and aU was darkness again. u I think that will do,\" said Heron. \" Goodness gracious !\" said Tom. \" Amen !\" \" Very well,\" said Heron; \" it shall never be said of me that I asked another to do that which I 6hrunk from myself. I wiU do it; but for your life's sake, Tom, be careful of Daisy ; for there is no adventure in aU the world, let it end how it may, that could compensate me for the loss of that faithful friend.\" \" Am I likely, Captain, not to be careful of Daisy?\" \" No, Tom ; but I could not help giving you the caution, since something like fear has taken possession of you by the mysteries of this bridle road.\" \"Did you fire, Captain?\" \" I did.\" \" Come away \u2014 come away !\" urged Tom ; \" it isn't worth staying.\" \" I don't know that ; let us see what is to be seen.\" \" I thought the world had blown up.\" \" Why, Tom, I thought you kuew by this time the sound of the report of a pistol ! \" \" Yes, Captain, but I was not thinking of it\" \"Hush, Tom!\" \" Oh, you don't mean to say, Captain, that it i. coming again ?\" \" Silence !\" Heron, as he spoke, rode with Daisy so close to the waU that he and she were both completely entangled and covered up by the ivy. By standing then upon the saddle, Heron was just able to look over into the garden of Hol land House. He might as weU have looked down a weU. The darkness was profound and excessive. But Heron was resolved to come at the root of Tom was stUl. The same strange waUing sound that had at first attracted the attention of Felix Heron in that lane now met his ears. the mystery, which had only gathered dimness and obscurity by the Uttle he had seen of it. \" Tom,\" he said, \" keep your pistols weU in hand, and use them freely enough if you see cause.\" It was a sound so altogether unlike any other tbat ever he had heard, that Captain Heron could not but Usten to it with a great deal of cu riosity. But it was nothing but curiosity with which Captain Heron Ustened to those sounds. Not the least particle of the smallest idea that they were supernatural crossed his mind. Upon Tom Ripon, however, they had a very iliffereiit effect, and he was fully prepared to be lieve that they came from beings of another i^orld, armed, possibly, with powers of mischief against which human weapons would be of no avail. \" I wUl. Captain\u2014 I wUl.\" Heron drew himself softly up to the top of the wall. He felt all the hazard of his position ; for if any one had been there, it would have been easy enough to pick him off by a pistol-shot, and so at once put an end to his career. But these were considerations which never in fluenced Felix Heron. If he had always stopped upon any enterprise to consider what might happen, he would soon have abandoned all that adventurous Use which possessed for him so many charms, and at home he would only have sought peace and serenity. It was precisely at that moment that Heron reflected upon one piece of forgetfulness that had come over him. But the tone in which Captain Heron had commanded him to be silent was one which he did not choose to disobey. Much inclined, therefore, as Tom Bipon was to urge an immediate departure from that gloomy spot, he held hia peace, and he suffered many pangs in sUence. The sounds ceased. It was easy enough to reach the top of the waU when mounted on the back of Daisy, but how was he readily, if it were necessary, to sur mount it from the inside ? But Oaptain Heron was by no means inclined to give up the adventure that had been so strangely commenced. He spoke to Tom Bipon in a low voice. \" You may depend, Tom, there is some door in the waU close at hand, which, no doubt, could be easUy enough opened from the inside.\" \" I shouldn't wonder, Captain.\" \" Very well, I'll help you over, and you can creep along and feel your way tiU you find a door at which you can let Daisy and me in ; I wiU bring in your horse likewise.\" \"Did you say help me over, Captain ?\" \" Yes ; the wall is not so high but that, hong ing to it with your hands, you can drop Ughtly and easUy on to the other side\" \" Yes,\" said Tom, \" and iuto the arms ef a dozen ghosts, at least\" This was a consideration that was worth at tending to, so Felix Heron carried out the in struction he had given to Tom Bipon \u2014 namely, to creep along the inner side of the waU untU he should find a door, by which a more ready access to the bridle-road could be got than by scaling it. It was not a particularly easy process. The thick ivy so completely impeded him, and sent down such showers of moisture upon him from the recent rains, that he could hardly make his way at all. Moreover, he walked upon some soft bed of earth that had been a flower-border. But these little difficulties soon ceased. \" Nonsense, Tom !\" Captain Heron came to firmer footing. He trod upon a gravelled path which termi- \" I couldn't de it. I would ii 1 could, but I"], [129, "It 123 EDITH HERON by that ns_ne ; and it was only by feeling along the wall, and finding the frames of pictures as close as they would go together, that he was able to come to the conclusion of where he was. nated close to the wall, and at a door, as he had suspected. But that door was locked. Age, however, had done its work with both its iron and wood work. Thus feehng his way, of course, he naturally came to a door. Heron had very Uttle difficulty with his sword in wrenching the lock completely off. The door then was only held close by one old rusty bolt which he shot in to its socket on the inner 6ide, and which he gueBsed had not been used for many a long year. It was slightly closed, but yielded to a touch. And Heron was very careful now in his pro- gress. Careful for two reasons. First, not to make a noise. Secondly,not to precipitate himself down some staircase which, in the darkness, he could not take the least cognizance of. He was certain that the thin streak of Ught he had seen coming from one of the rooms of Hol land House was on the upper floor. Therefore he had to seek for some staircase by which he could ascend. Having thus, Uke a prudent general, secured his retreat in case of accidents, FeUx Heron felt much more at ease in his mind as regarded the adven ture he was upon. He made his way, as nearly as he could guess in the darkness, at right angles from the waU. His route was impeded by shrubs and bushes, and occasionaUy by a tree. But at length he emerged upon an open lawn. Directly in front of him was the mansion. He could see it but dimly, and it looked of much greater extent than it reaUy was ; although Holland House is by no means one of the smaUest of those palatial half -baronial residences of the old nobUity of England, so few of which survive in the neighbourhood of the metropoUs. Not a leaf seemed to be stirring in the gardens. Not a human soul in the house. Suddenly he pauses. He hears confused voices. A flash of light, faint, but yet, amid the intense darkness that had surrounded him, sufficiently noticeable, streamed down upon him. \" HiUoa !\" cried a voice. \" Is that you, Jen nings ?\" 0f course Heron made no reply- _ut the light, faint as it was, was qnite suffi ci( at to let him see his whereabouts. But as Heron carefully ran his gaze over the ample front, he was certain that at one of the windows he saw a long, thin streak of Ught. It was very faint. But light it was. It looked like just such a thin perpendicular re flection as might come through an Ul^fitting shutter in the room beyond which was an iUumination. This was quite sufficient for Captain Heron. The adventure was working itseU out. Cautiously and slowly he made his way to wards the house. He was in the haU of the mansion. Statuary and pictures were about him on every side, and he had no difficulty in hiding himself behind one of the former, which he did as a pre cautionary measure, in case the person from above should come down to look for the \" Jen - nings \" he spoke of. But he did not come. And from the position he occupied FeUx Heron was able to see the exact position of the grand staircase, with its gUt balustrades aud the rich carpeting that covered it. He recoUected hearing that, in consequence of two sudden deaths in the Holland famUy, that beautiful and ancient home of their race had been for a time deserted, and that for a time it had be ceme the haunt of persons who found it their in terest to surround it with a halo of superstition, he did not doubt. CHAPTER CCXIX. CAPTAIN HERON DIVES STILL DliE_\"EK INTO THE MYSTERIES OF HOLLAND HOUSE. He was exceedingly curious to know who those persons were. \" I thought I heard Jennings,\" said the voice again, in tones of suspicion. Then another voice spoke ; and, from the in distinct manner in which FeUx Heron heard it, the person who spoke was evidently iu a room on the first floor of the mansion, the door of which might be only shghtly open. So carefuUy and so cautiously, that it was im possible his approach should be detected, Heron made his way onwards untU he stood close to the porch of the ancient residence. To the right of where he stood, so far as he could see it by straining his eyes in the darkness, the house seemed very much broken up into gable-ends and circular corners, but to the left there was a long range of windows. Heron concluded that they must belong to one of the principal rooms of the place. He thought it would be hard indeed if at some one or other of those windows be could not make bis way into the house. \" Come back ! \u2014 come back '\" cried this voice. \" Let Jennings alone.\" \"But the pistol-shot? You heard it as weU as I.\" \"Well, well! It's likely enough he's given an ounce of lead to somebody in the bridle-road ; and a good job too !\" The light disappeared. The man who had come to the head of the stairs with it had gone back again. He crept along them, touching their frame works gently. AU were fast but one . The darkness seemed to come down upon Heron in that ball with double blackness. That one, however, was enough \"for him. He opened the sash gently, and stepped into the picture gaUery of Holland House. Heron did not know the apartment, however, But he had noted well the position of the stair case, and was able to make his way to it with oertainty, although with prudence and caution."], [130, "EDITH HERON. 124 wind among the trees at night, nor do I ; and it's duU work, too. They may say what they like. of the beauty of the green glades, but give mo the green cloth that covers a faro table above them aU.\" He reached it. He touched the balustrades. As gently as foot could saU he commenced the ascent. And, as he did so, Heron asked himseU where, and under what tircumstances, he had heard the voice of the man who had spoken from the room to the other one at the head of the stairs. \" Well,\" said the third man, who had not yet spoken, \" I must say that I, too, prefer to crack cribs in London, to crying ' Stand and deliver !' on the highway.\" \" To be sure \u2014 to be sure !\" cried John Tarle ton ; \" and the one I was speaking to you about is the best crib you can get into.\" \" Whitcombe House, you mean ?\" \"To be sure I do !\" There was a famUiar accent about the tones which Captain Heron felt quite certain he had heard before. But where, he could not exactly define Heron paused at the head of the stairs, having lifted his foot once too often, and so brought it down with more force than he had intended. \" What can have become of Jennings ?\" said the man who had spoken before, and who seemed the most nervous and anxious of the three. In the intense sUence of that house this sound was enough to give an alarm. \" Oh, he is shot, or shot somebody.\" \" Come in, Jennings !\" cried a voice ; \" and don't be playing the fool out there !\" At the same moment a flash of light came over the landing-place to which Heron had attained. He saw several doors about him, some open and some closed. \" No.\" \" Why, didn't you say you heard it yourself ? Didn't he go out and play the ghost of the mur dered Captain as usual ? And haven't you heard Borne fire-arms in the bridle-road ? So U you put this and that together, what can you make of it?\" He chose one of the former, and made his way at once into a room which was in darkness, with one singular exception. \"You are careless, but I don't feel quite at ease.\" That exception was a Uttle oval spot of Ught upon one of its walls. A shriU whistle from the outside of the house at this moment attracted the attention of aU parties. Heron guessed in a moment from whence it pro ceeded. It came from some room adjoining in which there was a Ught, and that was the ray that made its way through the keyhole of a door of communication. \" That's my lord,\" cried John Tarleton. \" Take one of the lanterns, and show him in.\" The man who had expressed his fears and ap prehensions so freely, hesitated ; so the other, who seemed a stoUd sort of ruffian, took one of the lanterns, and growUng out some oaths as he went, left the room. It was singular, too, considering the small por tion of light that thus penetrated the darkness, what an effect it had. A faint, a very faint twUight, seemed to per meate that apartment, and to chase away com pletely that intense blackness which had ap peared in the atmosphere of the haU. Heron approached the door of communication quite easUy. Stooping down, he appUed his eye to the key hole, and saw a sight which filled him with surprise. At a table, on which were some bottiee and glasses, and on which were a couple of hand lanterns, the sUdes of which were thrown back, sat three men. In a few minutes he returned, bringing with siim two persons. One of them was no other than Lord Warring dale, who, from what Captain Heron had heard, he fully expected. The other was shorter than Warringdale by a head, and was both cloaked and masked, so that no one could recognise him. \" A friend of mine,\" said Warringdale, with a wave of the hand. \"Ah!\" cried John Tarleton; \"one of our sort ?\" Two were complete strangers to him. The third he knew full weU. \" Not exactly; but a gentleman, who has some thing to propose to us more profitable than any thing we have yet attempted.\" \" Pray be seated, Mr. Gentleman ; you're the man for our money. Pray be seated.\" The stranger in the cloak and mask turned to Lord Warringdale, and pointing as he did so to the flasks and glasses on the table, he said in an evidently feigned voice, \" Intemperance is fatal !\" In the brutahzed, intemperate features he re cognised John Tarleton. His, then, was the voice that had struck with familiar cadences upon the ears of Captain Heron. John Tarleton was speaking. \" Stuff !\" he cried ; \" don't talk to me of ghosts ; Haven't I slept here for a week, and seen none of them ?\" Lord Warringdale put on an air of ve:a tion. \" Yes ; but I can't make this out,\" growled one of the other men. \" Be assured, your Grace, it shall not be.\" \" Fool !\" cried the man with the mask and the \"Make what out?\" \" The foot upon the stair.\" \" Tho fiddlestick upon the stair, my good friend ! Pass the bottle.\" cloak, with a stamp of his foot. \" Why apply such a title to me ?\" John Tarleton and his two companions ex changed glances. \" You're a reckless fellow, as you always were ; but I wonder we've not his lordship here by this time.\" They felt quite certain, from that moment, that they were in the presence of one who was entitled by his rank to the prefix to his name that Lord Warringdale had incautiously given utterance to. \" Oh, he'll come, safe enough , he's sick of the forest, and so am I. He don't like to hear the"], [131, "125 EDTTH HEROK. \"I crave pardon,\" said Warringdale; \"but, being accustomed to call you that in jest, I did it inadvertently.\" \"Quite inadvertently,\" said John Tarleton, with a sneer. \"We shall meet again shortly, \"said Lord War ringdale to John Tarleton and his two rascally companions. \" Oh !\" said Tarleton, as he pointed in a sig nificant way to the flasks of liquor and the glasses on the table \u2014 \" we can wait very weU.\" Captain Heron was puzzled to know exactly what to do for the best. \" Business \u2014 to business,\" s.a_ tho man with the mask and the cloak. \" Then, sir,\" said Warringdale, \" I can only say, that I and theso worthy gentlemen are quite willing to be of uso in any way you may suggest.\" The man in the cloak seemed to consider a few minutes before he spoke again, and then speaking from behind the mask, and evidently at the same time making an effort to conceal his naitural voice, he murmured out his words rather than uttered them aloud. Nothing to him could be easier than to inter cept the man in the cloak and mask, and force from him the secret of his midnight machina tions ; or, if he, Heron, did not think proper to adopt that course, another was open to him. He could let Lord Warringdale and his myste rious companion go, and then make his way into the room in the occupation of John Tarleton and his rascaUy companions, and from them insist upon a fuU disclosure of the truth. But Heron was sharp of hearing. Every word, however Ughtly uttered, reached his ears. But, upon reflection, FeUx Heron determined upon adopting neither of those courses. He made up his mind to come at the heart of the mystery in another fashion. Was he not in possession of the means of ad mission to that house in town, whither John Tarleton and his associates had been invited ? \" There is a society of gentlemen who each pay five hundred guineas for certain service that may be rendered to them. The service is easy, but it requires three things.\" \"Please to name them,\" said John Tarleton. \" Address, for one.\" \"Well, sir?\" What, then, was to prevent him taking advan tage of the accidental information he had obtained, and so counteracting some iniquitous plot or pro ceeding which it would give him pleasure to f oU. Acting upon this idea, therefore, Captain Heron was desirous of leaving the house as speedUy as possible. \" Courage.\" \" And the third ?\" \" Utter unscrupulousness.\" John Tarleton laughed. \" Then, sir, whether you're a Grace or not, you have come to the right shop for that article, for here we have it in abundance. I think, my Lord Warringdale, you aud I are about the two most unscrupulous rascals in existence !\" \"Speak for yourself!\" said Warringdale, with a frown. There was no real difficulty in taking ' that step. So soon as John Tarleton and his associates were left to themselves, they began to pay so much attention to the flasks of wine and spirits on the table before them, that they were quicklj' obhvious of all sounds but what they themselves made. \" Oh, it's true \u2014 it's true !\" \" Peace ! I like not this levity !\" \" WeU, sir, what are we to do ?\" Heron gUded out of the room where he had been so attentive a spectator of the singular scene we have related, and making his way down tho grand staircase of Holland House, he left it by tho haU door, which he now found open. \" Of that you shall bo informed to-morrow night, and the next day you wiU commence your operations.\" \" For five hundred guineas ?\" \" That is the sum.\" No doubt Lord Warringdale, and the mysterious person in the cloak and mask, had so left it. \" And quickly and easUy earned ?'' \" Probably in an hour or two.\" \" I'm game for that !\" \" Listen,\" added the stranger with the cloak and mask. \" Near to Pall Mall, and some fifty paces past the gate of the old Palace of St. James's, there is a taU house, the lower part of which is of stone in its frontage. The windows of its ground floor have crimson bUnds. Come there to-morrow night at the midnight hour. Knock four times, not loudly, but so as to be dis tinctly heard \u2014 one steady, Ught blow of the knocker at each time \u2014 and you wiU be admitted and receive your instructions, and half your money in advance for your next day's work.\" This was aU very mysterious ; and Captain Heron, while ho could not imagine what kind of service was required by tbe person in the cloak and the mask, was resolved that he would know. \" I agree, for one,\" said John Tarleton. \" Then be true to the appointed time.\" \" Never fear me.\" Heron crossed the threshold, and was in the garden, when some one ran up to him and touched him on the arm. \"Is it you?\" he said. \"Is it you? TeU me U it is you, Deuce Ace ?\" Captain Heron remembered weU that that was the name by which John Tarleton went at the gaming-houses, and among the disreputable com panions of his Ul-spent hours. There was a pecuUarity of John Tarleton which it was not difficult, to imitate, and Captain Heron, now that he was chaUenged with being that person, essayed to keep up the delusion. \"What's the matter?\" he said. \"Oh, yes, it's you, Deuce Ace, I hear now; for it's so precious dark I can't see you ; and when I came up to you I thought you looked ever so much taUer.\" \" What's the matter ?\" said Heron again. \" WeU, yon see, I was on the watch, as usual, and I was quite 6ure I heard some people in the lane, so I tried to frighten them off in the old fashion by playing the ghost. I got on the ladder, as usual, and hoisted myseU up above the old ivy on the waU.\" The man in the cloak and mask at once moved to the door of the room, and made a sign to Lord Warringdale that he intended to leave."], [132, "126 EDITH HERON. \" Indeed !\" CHAPTER, OCXS. \"Oh,. yes! But whoever it was wouldn't be frightened at all ; but, without saying so much as by your leave, fired a pistol-shot at me, and the buUet took off the corner of my ear.\" TOM RIPON TRIES HIS FORTUNE ON THE KOAS, AOT) TAKES SOME VALUABLE BOOTY. \" You don't say so !\" \"Yes. You must have heard the shot. I have Tom Ripon and Captain Heron spoke both at the same moment. been hiding in one of the old, dilapidated summer houses ever since, and have only just now ven tured to creep out.\" \" Jonathan WUd !\" was the exclamation thai burst from each of their Ups. Yes, it was no other than WUd, who, on that night expedition in search of the Baron Von Peck, had got on to the Western Road. \" HUloa !\" he shouted. \"Who are you?\" Captain Heron could not but smUe to UimseU at this rational account of the ghostly phenomenon that had had such an effect upon the nervous system of Tom Ripon. That this was the man who had been caUed to by the name of Jennings there could be no doubt whatever ; and now, having heard all he had to say, Captain Heron was anxious to get rid of him. \"A poor man, sir!\" \" Bah ! I don't care whether yon are poor or rich ! What are you, and what is your name ?\" \"John Dobkins, sir, and a market gardener.\" \" Very weU ! Now teU me U you have seen _ man on horseback on the road, and a boy ?\" \"You'd better go in,\" he said. \"You'U get something to drink.\" \" That's just whatll suit me. AU's right ! It might have been worse.\" Mr. Jennings brushed past Captain Heron, and made his way into HoUand House. \"Now for Tom Ripon and the horses!\" said Heren to himseU, as he made his way as quickly as he could to the door in the wall of the garden, which he had so arranged that he could open quickly and make an immediate exit. That door was soon found, and Heron emerged into the bridle-road, calling out as he did so, \" Tom ! Tom ! where are you ?\" \"Here, Captain, here ! Why, you've been away a week ! \" \" No, sir !\" \" You are quite sure 7\" \" Oh, quite, sir !\" \"Confusion!\" muttered Jonathan WUd; \"I have missed them ! You can pass on !\" The man in the chaise-cart seemed glad to get past so imperious a questioner on the 'road, and he drove off as quickly as he weU could. \" Captain !\" whispered Tom. \"WeU?\" \" What on earth does anybody mean by call ing me a boy?\" \"Because you are not a girl, I suppose, Tom !\" This was anything but a satisfactory reply to Tom Bipon ; and he felt inclined to relapse into silence for some time. \" I think scarcely an hour, Tom ; although the time doubtless has seemed long to you. Let us ride on, for the night is still young, and as we go I wUl teU you what I've heard and seen in HoUand House.\" That was just what FeUx Heron liked; for he was at that moment busy with his own thoughts. He could scarcely guess how Jonathan WUd could so readUy have come upon his track. But the fact was that WUd had reached the im mediate neighbourhood of the bridle-path by HoUand House a very short time after FeUx Heron and Tom Bipon. Tom Bipon was very much interested at the brief account Captain Heron gave hun of John Tarleton and his associates. \" Of course, Captain,\" said Tom, \" it's some vUlany or another, and we're not the sort of men to see it go on and not try to put an end to it.\" \" Certainly not, Tom ; but here we are, on the Western Road, and I am not sorry, for one, to leave that gloomy bridle-road behind us.\" The rapid gaUoping of horses' feet coming from London put a check to further conversation between Tom Ripon and Captain Heron. From a chance passenger he heard that two such persons had gone down the narrow tho roughfare. WUd knew it weU. It led nowhere but to the Western Road; and he at once adopted a coarse that he thought would enable him to watch weU the proceedings of Tom and the supposes! Baron Von Peck. WUd had some special objection to passing down the bridle-road at the side of old HoUand House. They both involuntarily drew aside into tho shadow of that portion of the waU of Holland House garden which directly fronted the Western Road. Perhaps that objection bore some special re ference to thc bad name the lane had. The horseman approached at good speed, but before he reached the spot whero they might be said to be in hiding he slackened his pace, the cause of which seemed to bo that from the oppo site direction some vehicle was approaching. But be that as it may, he avoided it. \"Galloping on, therefore, to that road which Tom had mentioned to Heron, and which was about haU a mile further on, Jonathan WUd felt that he was losing no ground. It was a Ught chaise, and in which one man was seated, and in front of which a small lamp was burning, which shed sufficient rays of Ught about it to enable Heron and Tom Ripon to make tolerably accurate observation of what was going on. On emerging from it into the Western Road, his impression decidedly wus that he was lower down the road than Bairon Von Peck and Tom Bipon. \" Hilloa!\" cried tho horseman, who came from from the direction of London. \" Halt, there ! I want to ask you a question.\" At a walk, therefore, Jonathan took his horse townwards. Ho paused as he passed the bridle-road, and Ustened. The man tn the chaise cart pulled up abruptly."], [133, "127 EDITH H___OX. But he heard no sound It happened that that was just the time when Heron was in the mansion, and Tom was, al though in the lane with both the horses, as qeiiet as a mouse. Jonathan Wild was puzzled. He could not make out how it was he had missed, or apparently missed, the Baron Von Peck and Tom Ripon. After lingering a little on the roadway, he still pursued his route towards London, for the con viction on his mind was still so strong that they had not passed him towards the country, that he could look for them nowhere but in that direc tion. Still, however, his mind misgave him after he had trotted about half a mile, and he returned again. It was upon that return that Tom Ripon and Felix Heron saw him so plainly. What were they to do ? Were they to be content with the adventures of that night, and return home in peace ? Should they determine to do that, they might defy Jonathan Wild, who woeild have no excuse then for interfering in any way with the Baron Von Peck. Felix Heron felt all the hazard he ran. But the spirit of adventure was strong within him. Was he to be baulked in what he had under taken just because Jonathan Wild was on the road? Certainly not. \" Tom !\" he whispered. \"Yes, Captain.\" \" We must wait a few moments until Wild is gone.\" \"We might do better, Captain.\" \" As how ?\" \" Why not take the Kensington Road instead of the Western ? Tbe one's as good as the other.\" \" True ; but you have rather a disinclination, I fanoy, to pass down the bridle-road again.\" \"Not with you, Captain.\" \" Be it so, then. Keep close !\" Foiled and enraged, Jonathan Wild paced his horse slowly westward, and when he had got about a hundred yards past the hiding-place of Heron and Tom Ripon, the former gave the word to move on. \" Follow me, Tom,\" he said, u but walk your horse, so that its footsteps shall make as light a sound as possible.\" Noiselessly they reached the bridle-road again by the side of Holland House ; and then, as they were quite sufficiently distant from Jonathan Wild to be out of hearing, they both set out at a hard trot. And the bridle-road was so soft and humid. that even at that pace their horses' feet scarcely made a sound. A very few minutes sufficed for them to traverse the whole of that road ; and to the great relief of Tom Ripon, they emerged again in the immediate neighbourhood of Kensington. In the south-east there was a rapidly brighten ng sky. A young moon wxs rising over the tree-tops. Tom shook his head. \" I'm afraid, Captain, it'll be too light for us.\" \" No, Tom. A moonlight night and a cloudy sky is a highwayman's delight.'' \" Then we shall have it,\" said Tom, \" for I see the clouds are breaking away ; and, young 33 the moon is, it will shine like silver.\" They paeised, and turned their attention to th\u00ab beautiful 1_mi__ry which rose majestically over a clump of trees in a garden of some estate close at nand. \" This is very beautifeil,\" said Heron. \" It's stunning,\" said Tom. \" Who woeild not rather enjoy this,\" added Heron, \"in preference to the crowed saloons of the Court?\" \" Hurrah !\" said Tom. \" What's the matter '!\" \" Don't you hear, Captain, the crunching and grinding of carriage wheels ?\" \" I fancy I do.\" \"Yes, Captain, and there come th\u00a9 carriage fights. Don't you see a pair-horee chaise, driven by a postilion, and nobody in the dicky behind 7\" \" Very well, Tom ; this shall be your adven ture.\" \" You don't mean that, Captain ?\" \" Yes ; but if you should happen to be over matched, whistle for me, or fire one of your pistols, and 111 soon be by your side. But always remember, Tom, no : it is quite aa easy to rob on the highway gently as roughly.\" Tom Ripon was so well pleased that Captain Heron had left this adventure to him, that waving his hand without speaking a word, he dashed for ward into tbe road to intercept the chaise. \" Halt ! halt !\" he cried to tbe postilion. \" Halt ! or you're a dead man !\" The only reply of the postilion -was to make a slash at Tom with his whip, and then to urge his horses forward. The situation of Tom Ripon was a httle critical, and if he had not, in consequence of his frequent expeditions with Captain Heron, become by this time a pretty good horse rider, ke might have got tbe worst of the encounter, from the pure weight of the pair of horses and the chaise. As it was, Tom trotted by the side of the horses, and seized the check-rein of the one nearest him. \" Hands off, you rascal !\" oried the postilion \" Hands off !\" \" Halt !\" cried Tom, \" or it will he worse for you !\" The postilion lashed at him furiously with his long-thonged whip. Tom got some smarting cuts about the head and shoulders. Slowly and surely, however, he was succeed ing in his object, which was to tuna the horses' heads from the direct road towards the hedge row. \" You'll upset us, you vagabond, as sure ae fate !\" cried the postilion. \" You'll upset Mr. Brydges, his Majesty's jeweller, and you'll be hung as sure as fate !\" \"That'll do!\" cried Tom. Ee relinquished his hold of the horses' heads. The-fore wheels of the chaise lurched into the hollow of the road, close to the pathway, and the horses, feeding a blackthorn hedge opposed to their further progress, came to an abrupt halt"], [134, "128 EDITH IIEROIt- \" That'U do !\" cried Tom. \" Then what are we to do with it, Captain ?\" \" Just nothing ; and yet, when I think of il, ihe horses wiU get into mischief. Cut these traces, Tom, and let them go whither they wiU ; in aU probabiUty they wiU find their way to then- own stables, wherever they may be.\" \" 111 do it,\" said Tom, \"but it's rather disap pointing. I see the chaise is only hung upon leather springs, so I'U just let that down, and see If I can't get it into the ditch by the road-side.\" \" Stop, stop, Tom ! On second thoughts, a novel idea strikes me. I wUl get into the chaise, and you shaU lead Daisy, and I wiU contrive to drive it with the reins through the front window. It wiU be something new in the history of Use on the road to cry ' Stand and deUver !' from the interior of a coach !\" \" Yes, I hope that'U do !\" said the postUion. As he spoke, ho reversed his whip, and coiiing the thong round his wrist, ha made a heavy and savage blow at Tom's head with the butt-end of it. Tom saw the blow coming, and backed his horse suddenly at least a dozen paces beyond its influence. But the patience and the discretion of Tom Bipon were both exhausted. \" Take that !\" he said. As be spoke, he drew one of his holster pistols, and fired it direct at the head of the postUion. In the midst of tho smoke and the flash Tom Bipon certainly saw the white hat of the pos tilion flying through the air, but whether it con tained his head or not likewise he could not de termine. Captain Heron might or might not have been serious in this proposition ; but he certainly dis mounted and leaped into the open coach. Almost as he did so, Tom Ripon was nearly startled out of his senses by a voice crying out, in loud yelling tones, \" Mercy, mercy ! I'm a dead man ! \u2014 I'm a dead man !\" Certainly the saddle of the horse was empty. \" That'U do !\" said Tom. \" A mighty obstinate fellow that was, but he would have it !\" Tom dashed his heels against his horse's flanks, aud was at the side of the coach in an instant. \" Now, sir !\" cried Tom, as he looked in. The moon shone tolerably brightly in at the other window. The voice unquestionably came from tho chaise. Then avery blank look came over Tom Bipon 's countenance. For a moment Tom could almost have imagined the vehicle itseU was endowed with some miracu lous voice, and was giving utterance to its com plaints. The coach was empty. \" Confound the fellow!\" said Tom. \" AU this trouble about nothing !\" He looked again more carefully. There could be no mistake about it But a few words from Captain Heron soon put things to rights in Tom's mind. \"AU's right!\" said Heron. \"Here's your man, Tom.\" For all he knew, a passenger might have been in the chaise, but he was not there then. And what made it more puzzUng still was, that Tom felt perfectly sure neither door of the coach had been opened during the brief but decisive contest he had had with the postUion. What to do Tom knew not. \"Good gracious, Captain !\" Tom looked through the window of the chaise ; and, to his intense surprise, saw a small, fright ened-looking being, in a fuU Court suit, trembling in the grasp of Captain Heron. \" Why, where did he come from, Captain ?\" \" From under one of the seats, that's all\" \" Oh, idiot, idiot!\" said Tom. \" Yes,\" gasped the Uttle man in the Court suit ; \" I am an idiot \u2014 a poor idiot gentleman going to an asylum.\" \" I meant myseU,\" said Tom, \"for not guessing where you were.\" It was just \u00a9ne of those emergencies in which he required the advice of Captain Heron. Now, the pistol-shot had reached Heron's ears quite plainly, and almost at the moment that Tom was wishing for the appearance of his friend and master, Heron trotted up. \" What's amiss, Tom ?\" \" Oh, Captain, I am so glad you're here ! The only booty I seem likely to get is a chaise and pair.\" \" What do you mean ?\" \" Why, it's empty, Captain ; although the postUion fought Uke a Uon, as if the wealth of the Indies were inside it ; and now I think of it, he did say that Mr. Brydges, the King's jeweUer, was here.\" CHAPTER CCXXI CAPTAIN HERON AND TOM RIPON ARE WATCIEGD AND PURSUED BY JONATHAN WILD. Heron had about as much power over this per son in the coach as U he had been a mere chUd, and he mode him sit down on the seat opposite to him with aU the ease in tho world. Heron looked into the coach. \" It's empty, Tom ! Who did you fire at ?\" \" Oh, I was forced to settle the postUion !\" \" I hope not.\" \" Well, I couldn't help it, Captain.\" Heron raised his voice. .. \" Speak up, if any one is hurt. There wiU be no more harm done, and some help given !\" There was no response to this polite invitation. Heron knew not what to do exactly. He felt in the position of some naval commander who has captured a ship at sea too heavy for him to bring along. \" We cannot encumber ourselves, Tom, with a chaise and pair !\" \"You need not be frightened, sir,\" he said. \" No one wiU harm you.\" \" Certainly not,\" said Tom. \" AU we want is your money, your watch, jeweUery, and, in fact, everything of value you have about you ! We don't want any dead bodies just now, because wo have suppUed all our regular customers with them, and so you're safe !\" \" Mercy upon us !\" said the Uttle man. \" Come, come,\" said Tom, \"hand out.\" \" Yes, my good sir, with great pleasure. There's my watch. You'U find it a good one to go.\""], [135, "EDITH HERON. 129 \"I should say it was,\" said Tom. \"And now it's gone altogether !\" \"Jew.Uery, my good sirs, I have none ; but my money you are welcome to. Here it is, amount ing to one and ninepence, which I put in my pocket to pay the turnpikes between Kew and London.\" \" You may call me Brydges.\" \" And the friend you went to visit at Kew, in a Court dress, was no other than the King ?\" \"Mercy upon us! What put that into your head?\" \"And your visit could only be professional. Come, sir, you have jewels of value about you, and we must have them.\" \" One and what ?\" cried Tom. \"Ninepence.\" I declare, by aU the saints ' \"Stop,\" said Heron. \"What were you doing at Kew ?\" \" Stuff ! You don't beUeve in 6aints, so it's no oath.\" \" I \u2014 I went to visit a friend. \" But, my good sir \u2014 ' \"Tom!\" \"In a Court dress, with diamond buckles in your shoes ?\" \" Yes, Captain.\" \" Take this man out of the coach, and pick him to pieces!\" \"AU's right!\" \"Paste, paste, my dear sir \u2014 nothing but pa as I am a jeweUer and a Christian man !\" \"Oh, then, you are a jeweller?\" \" WeU, I \u2014 a \u2014 I \u2014 a \u2014 think I am.\" Mr. Brydges feU at once to the bottom of the coach as though he had been ehot ; and, driving u And your name is Bry No. 69.\u2014 Edith."], [136, "130 EDITH HERON. his hand under tho seat, he produced a smaU black leather packet, which ho handed to Heron. \" There,\" ho said, \" are the jewels I took to show to the King, and if you take them from me I'm a ruined man.\" Tom sUghtly touched Heron's arm at this moment ; and the touch was so evidently one of warning, that, without speaking a word, he turned, and looked in Tom's faco to know what it meant. \" That we've nothing to do with,\" said Tom. \"We are ruined if wo don't take them !\" They were just in that bit of country between the little village of Brook Green and Shepherd's Bush. \"Alas! alas!\" said the little jeweller, as he sank back upon the seat opposite to Heron, in the coach, with a look of profound despair \u2014 \" alas ! alas ! I am lost \u2014 I am ruined I I am Murder ! What's that ?\" There is there still a large triangular piece of common ground dividing the two roads, one of which leads to Acton and Ealing, and the other to Hammersmith. He sprang to his feet again with great celerity. A rather broad turning to the right, as Felix Heron and Tom Ripon stood with their faces to wards London, led to Brook Green. \" It seems to me,\" said Heron, \" that you've something in your pocket, on which you havo inadvertently sat down.\" The little jeweller looked perfectly aghast. \" Come, sir, hand it forth !'' With a groan, he took from his pocket an ex quisitely-fashioned gold cup, round the rim of which was an entire circle of Oriental jewels, while the stem and foot were thickly encrusted with brilliants. That turning, at the period of our story, was so little frequented, that it was completely grass grown, with the exception of a few cart-tracks ; and a row of tall poplars on each side of the way shadowed it, as well as narrowed it, completely. It was towards these poplars that Tom silently pointed. Captain Heron foUowed the direction indicated with his eyes, and there he certainly saw a horse man looking as motionless as a statue, and who might have been mistaken for one, but for the improbabiUty of such an object in such a spot. \" Who is that ?\" said Tom in a whisper. \"I don't know?\" \" What shaU we do, Captain ?\" \" Nothing but ride on.\" \" But haven't you an idea about him ?\" \" Only one, Tom, that seems at all reasonable, at this time in tfoe morning.\" \"What do you think ho is, then, Captain?\" \"A highwayman.\" \" Oh, if tfoafs the case,\" said Tom. with a long breath of reUef, \" it's aU right. What used we to say at the forest ? \u2014 ' hawks don't pick hawks' eyes out.' Come op, Captain !\" It seemed to Heron \u2014 but he was not quite sure upon that point \u2014 that as they passed the road lead ing to Brook Green, where this horseman was stationed, ho gradually receded so as to be more in the gloom, and shatjpw of the trees. It was certainly nos Heron's poUcy, however, to take any notice of him, be ho whom he might. Passing on quickly with Tom, they soon left the suspicious object behind them, and mounting the rise of Notting Hill, they paused for a few seconds within a hundred yards oi the turnpike gate to listen. The sound mado by their own horse's feet had, up to that moment, prevented them from hear ing the regular tramp of another horse behind them. As the moonbeams feU upon this article of goldsmith's work, the brilliants shot forth a thou sand beautiful rays. There could be no doubt of their great value. The jeweller did not seem to have breath enough now to speak with ; and it was only in a spasmodic manner that foe contrived to jerk out, \" The King \u2014 his Majesty \u2014 entrusted mo with that cup to take out the brilfoants from it, and set them in a bracelet, for a present to tho Duchess of Oldenburg ! If you take it from me, I'm a ruined man !\" \" Nonsense !\" said Heron ; \" you're as liable to be stopped on the highway as anybody ! How are you to keep it ? You have done your best ; and the King capnot blame you for that which is inevitable.\" As Heron spoke, he sprang from the coaefo. It was possible enough that the jeweller might have other booty of value ; but still Heron felt that he ought to be very well satisfied with the issue of tho adventure. \" Take care of that black case, Tom,\" he said. \" I have the King's cup. Let us mount, and away !\" \"Which way, Captain?\" \" By a circuitous route homeward.\" \"AU's right!\" Heron sprang to the back of Daisy, and, in stead of turning townwards, ho trotted down tho sloping country in the direction of the Thames. Tom followeel him speedily. Heron then took the first turning he could to the right, and came out through tho eastern suburbs of Hammersmith ; after which, he turned his face towards London. \" Wo ai'O pursued, Tom. Lot me think a mo ment.\" \" I'll 'go back and shoot Mm,\" said Tom. \"No, no ! I think we might make a g->Uop for it, and so distance him. And yet, after all, that might not succeed ; for although I could match Daisy easily against any horse, our enemy may bo quite as weU mounted as you are, Tom.\" \" Then you ride on, Captain, and leave mo to shUt for myself.\" \" Would it bo Uke mo to do so ?\" \" Tom !\" \" Yes, Captain.\" \" It seems we have carried through that ad venture without the sUghtest peril.\" \" I hope so, Captain.\" \" I don't hear a singlo person upon tho road ! Let us see what the time is.\" Heron held up his watch to tho moonbeams, which wore just sufficiently powerful to enable him to see that the hour was three iu tho inorn- Tom was silent. Ho know it would bo useloss to i.:-;re that plan ing. any farther."], [137, "131 EDITH HERON. It was evident that the horseman in their rear had a pursuit of them for his object, for now that they had come to a standstill, the Bound of his horse's feet stopped abruptly. \"It is Jonathan Wild,\" said Heron. \" Of course it is,\" said Tom ; \"and I teU you what it is, Captain \u2014 we shall know no peace tiU we get rid of him !\" \"How?\" \" Anytliing, Captain ! I'm gamo for it, what- ever it is !\" \" We must get through this turnpike gate our selves, and, at least for a time, prevent Jonathan WUd from doing so.\" Tom felt that this was rather a difficult propo sition. Indeed, it would have been an impossible one had WUd reaUy been in pursuit of Heron and Tom Bipon ; but the fact was, his progress on the road was speculative, and he was making such speed as ho might. Had he been on the gaUop instead of stiU en tertaining a suspicion that those he sought might after aU be behind him, Captain Heron would not have been able to carry out in time the littlo scheme which his fertile brain suggested. Daisy, he knew perfectly well, could carry him over tho turnpike gate at a flying leap. But Tom's horse was unequal to such a feat. Moreover, that would not exactly have an swered his purpose. \" Tom,\" he said, \" the gate is no doubt locked.\" \"You may make sure of that, Captain. All these old pikes are, after sunset ; and, bother the fellow, his Uttle crib of a houso is on tho other side.\" \"A bullet!\" \" No, Tom ; there is one consideration which will induce me never to lUt my hand against Jonathan WUd's Use, if I can help it.\" \" Indeed !\" \" Yes, he believes me dead ; and sinco then, in his rough, careless way, he has shown a disposi tion to befriend Edith. And, at aU events, he has no longer been an enemy of hers, or of what ho considers her fatherless chUd ; and, bad as he is, that trait in his nature commends him to my consideration.\" \" But he's after us now, Captain !\" \" You forget, Tom, that it is the Baron Von Peck he is after, aud not Felix Heron.\" \"Oh, ah! to be sure! WeU, I don't want to shoot Johnny, but it's very awkward.\" \" It is, and I am thinking what to do. Ho may find a means of foUowing us to town, I do not doubt, so I shall not go direct to Whitcombe House. What is that, Tom, you wore telUng me about Mortification and your mother taking some shop in their old trade ?\" \"AU the better, Tom. Hold Daisy a mo ment.\" \" Bless you, Captain, sho don't want holding. All you've got to say is to tell her where you want her to stand, and what you want her to do, and she'U do it Uke a Christian, and a great deal better than many of them.\" \" I beUeve you, Tom. Wait a bit, and I'll soon let you through tho pike.\" Captain Heron hastily dismounted, and made his way through tho Uttle wicket gate for foot passengers on tho pathway by the side of tho road. \" Why, you see, Captain, ' what's bred in the bone wUl never grow out of the flesh,' as tho old proverb says ; and thoy have taken an old tumble-down sort of crib in Wardour Street, Soho.\" \" I recollect, Tom, your mentioning somo such circumstance ; and I thought it hard at the time that Mortification and your mother, to both of whom I have at times been a good friend, should desert my household at Whitcombe House, which as you know, Tom, I can only people with those who know the secret of my existence.\" Tom made a wry face. \" It's wrong enough, Captain, of tho old gal as weU as of old Mortification ; but it oan't be helped ; and who shall say now that it don't servo us at a pinch ?\" \" True \u2014 true !\" That small thoroughfare was cunningly con trived, so that nothing on four legs should bo able to pass through it. Tho Uttle wooden hut in which thc turnpike keeper resided was closely shut up ; and, no doubt, its occupant was in profound repose. Tho usual shout of \" Gate, gate !\" would, in all probabiUty, have aroused him, sinco it was a thing of habit at such a cry to get up and issuo forth, take his toU, and open the gate, closing and locking it again, and retiring again to rest, aU in a mcehanical land of way only to bo acquired by custom. \"And as, Captain, you have a particular ob jection to settling matters with Jonathan Wild by means of a bullet, and an equal objection to his dodging us home to Whitcombe House, what do you say to a visit to the new ' fence ?' \" \" Be it so, Tom ! Let us get on, in the name of heaven, for I do not wish to be the death of that man !\" But it is doubtful if any other sound whatever except that cry of \" Gate, gato !\" would have affected tho repose of the pike-keeper. Felix Heron found no difficulty in opening the door of tho little hut by one vigorous kick. The pike-keeper sprang from his paUet-bed, and confronted tho intruder. \" All's right, Captain ; and I'm sure wo neither of us intend ho should be the death of us !\" The tramp of Jonathan Wild's horse was stiU upon the road. Neither to the right nor to the left was any turning down which Tom Bipon and Captain Heron could make their way without being pretty sure to be dogged and traced. But Captain Heron was not the sort of man to be foUed by even tho rather uncomfortable train of circumstances surrounding him. \" Tom,\" he said, \" we must do one thing, and \" SUence \"' said Heron, as ho lot thc man see the bright barrel of a pistol. \" Thieves ! Mur \" \" Another such a word, and you are a dead man ! Be prudent and silent, and no harm wiU oome to you !

Jonathan Wild, had hastUy adopted a ruse he thought best on this occasion. He flung himself flat in the middle of the road on his own side of the gate, so that he was safe from any assault on the part of Jonathan Wild, and began to utter the most awful groans. \" Gate, gate, I say !\" cried Wild. \" HUloa ! Pike, pike ! Ill have you hanged, you scoundrel, if you keep me waiting another moment !\" Jonathan's eyes then feU upon the prostrate form of the gate-keeper. \"What's this? what's all this?\" he shouted. \" Drunk, I suppose ! I'U rouse you up with a vengeance!\" WUd tied the bridle of his horse to the top most bar of the turnpike gate, and was quickly on his feet on the other side. \" I daren't.\" Heron dived his hand into his pocket, and flung several guineas upon a rough table that was in the hut. \" Take your choice,\" he said ; \" which wiU you prefer \u2014 gold or lead ?\" \" Gold or lead, sir ?\" \" Yes, guineas or a bullet !\" \" Stop ! stop ! Ha, ha ! I see it all now !\" \" AVhat do you mean ?\" \" You're a highwayman, and there's somebody after you.\" \"A bright guees!\" \" Lord bless you ! I footed the pad myself once, though I couldn't come the high-flying toby business, because, you see, I never took to horse back. Some do, and some don't. I think it's born with people. But I keeps a pike now, because a stray bullet was sent after me ono fine night, and touched me ou the heel ; so that spoilt my gaUvan ting, though I've a fellow-feeling for ' the family' still.\" \"Mercy upon me!\" said the gate-keeper. \" Two ruffians have just come through the pike, and after I'd locked the gate again, instead of tho toU, they knocked mo down, and I think they've stove in my skulk as well as took the key away.\" \" The key \u2014 the key of the pike ?\" \"Just so.\" \" All's right, then !\" said Heron. \" Keep the guineas, and give me the key.\" \"Here you are!\" \" Thanks.\" \" A man and a boy ? \u2014 the man on a dark bay mare, the like of which you wiU never see again on the longest summer night you may Uve ?\" \" Yes ; and he called the boy Tom.\" WUd gave a howl of rage. \" The Baron \u2014 the Baron !\" he shouted, \u2014 \" the Baron, and the Earl of Whitcombe's horse, and that young viUain, Ripon, with him !\" \" The who, sir ?\" \" I kngfiv your game. But who is after you ?\" \"Jonathan WUd!\" \"Ah!\" A look of consternation came upon the face of the pUteman, and he half repented that his attach ment to \"the family \" carried him so far, on that occasion, as to place him in antagonism to the great thief-taker. Captain Heron, however, left him no time for repentance. \" Get out, idiot ! A hatchet \u2014 a sledge-hammer \u2014 anything that'U break down the gate !\" \" It's felony, sir, by Act of ParUament, to break down a turnpike gate. \" Provided now with the great key of the turn pike gate, which from constant use was clear and bright, Heron dashed out of the hut, and opening the gate, called out in a subdued tone. \"Tom! Tom! Quick! quick! The horses! Come through !\" Tom Bipon did not want for a second invita tion, but was through the turnpike gate in a moment. CHAPTER CCXXII. JONATHAN WILD SUCCEEDS IN HIS PURSUIT OF HERON. \u2014 MRS. RIPON'S NEW \" FENCE.\" Heron then locked it and, placed the key in his pocket. \"My good feUow,\" he said to the pikeman, \" you can't be blamed now, for, you see, I take the key from you by force ; and, when Jonathan WUd comes up, you had better advise him to climb the gate, horse and aU \u2014 or else he wiU find it rather a difficult matter to keep up with us.\" Jonathan Wild was so enraged at the cool manner in which the turnpike keeper obstructed bis progress, that, drawing hastily one of his pistols, he leveUed it at the man's head, as he cried in a voice that was hoarse with rage, \" Wretch ! vUlain ! you shall hang for this, as sure as my name is Jonathan Wild !\" The man was terrified at the looks and gestures of the great thief-taker, whom he knew perfectly well, and who he knew was quite capable of carry ing out any threat in which he might think proper to indulge. \" There's au axe just inside the pike-house, sh-,\" he said, \" if you go in and turn to the left \" Jonathan WUd did not wait for the man to finish his sentence, but rushing into the little wooden habitation of the pike-keeper, he glared about him with the utmost ferocity. \"Ah!\" he cried, as his eyes fell upon a short, bright-bladed axe ; \" this is the very thing.\" WUd felt now utterly hopeless. He was, with out his horse, hopeless of the capture of the Baron Von Peck, and of Tom Ripon, which he had set his heart upon. A few vigorous strokes with she <ute soon \"Stop! stop!\" Heron did not stop, however, but giving a hasty direction to Tom to gaUop forward at his utmost speed, he himself followed with Daisy, for if Heron had gone first, Tom would soon have been distanced, and they would necessarily have parted company. Some slight indication of a confusion at the turnpike gate had met the ears of Jonathan Wild, as he came up tho long slope of hUl from Holland Park ; aud by the time he reached within a hundred horse paces of the gate, he felt con fident something interesting to him was taking place. \" Gate ! gate !\" he yeUed as he leant from his horse, and shook it violently. The gatekeeper, with a wholesome terror of"], [139, "133 EDITH HERON. \"Oh ! you want to know who I am ?\" \" Rather.\" knocked off the rather dilapielated lock of the turnpike gate. \" That's done !\" cried Wild. \"Jonathan Wild.\" The watchman had unhooked the little front wicket of his watch-box, and at the mention of this dreaded namo he fell right out of it on his hands and knees, as he gasped oat, \" Jonathan \u2014 that is, Wild\u2014 Mr. \" \"Murder!\" shouted the gate-keeper. Jonathan had flung the axe carelessly at him, and although, lucidly for him, it only struck flat wise, it leveUed the pike-keeper, who was just scrambling to his feet, to the ground again. Utterly heedless of whatever damage he might have done, Jonathan WUd now led his horse through the dUapidated pike, and springing on to its back he started off at a gaUop. But he could see nothing of the Baron Von Peck or of Tom Bipon. \" WeU ?\" \" I asks your honour's worship's pardon. I'll take the horse.\" \" Of course you will.\" Wild strode off without deigning to bestow an other look upon either horse or watchman. He kept in the shadow of the houses as he strolled slowly up Princes Street, walking in that odd manner habitual to him, with his body bent, slightly forward, and his legs wide apart. Wild, when on foot, always seemed as though ready to spring on some one, or to be alert and on the look-out lest some one should spring upon him unexpectedly. Then he drew rein, and began to think. \" Let me see,\" he said. \" What will they do now, and where wUl they go ? Certainly not home to Whitcombe House, for by this time they must have an idea that some one is on their track.\" One of Wild's great ingenuities, and upon which he prided himself, was in that strange kind of iden tification with the thoughts and opinions of the criminal population, which enabled him, although at a distance, to decide almost propheticaUy what they would do next. \" Yes,\" he muttered, \" that will be the game. This rascal Von Peck is, after all, only sonio foreign highwayman ; but since he has crept into favour with the Countess of Whitcombe he is initiated into the old ways of Captain Heron by that young scamp, Tom Ripon. But I'll hang him ! Ha, ha ! I'll hang him ! and, by so doing, I shaU save the Countess the commission of an indiscretion ; for, on my faith, I believe she would marry the rascal !\" WUd reached tho commencement of AVardour And now, as he halted his horse, and pressed his hand upon his brow, he asked himself where the Baron Von Peck and Tom Ripon, presuming them to be in possession of the booty they were, would be Ukely to take it. \"Yes!\" he cried suddenly; \"that's it! Ire collect now, Mrs. Ripon has taken a new ' fence ' in AVardour Street, Soho, along with that old canting rascal, Mortification, and there I shall find them.\" Like most men of action, Jonathan Wild had Street. Then he ensconced himself in a doorway, anil peered about him right and left, to make sure that no one was watching him. Tho street was quite deserted. A couple of low-looking, villanous public houses that were in it were, by that time, closely shut. not many ideas. But those he had, he quickly carried out. In another half-hour he was in London. A private watchman who had a box constructed in the doorway of a jeweller's shop, was looking dreamily out of it, and wondering if the night had passed away, as AVUd stopped abruptly and dismounted. \" AU's stiU,\" said Wild ; \" but I wouldn't mind taking my oath \u2014 not that I mind that much at most times \u2014 that I shaU find the birds I want to cage at old Mother Ripon's.\" The place was Coventry Street, a few paces from tho top of the Haymarket, and close to the old, dingy, disreputable thoroughfare then known as SwaUow Street ; but whicli has in more modern times given place to the aristocratic Regent Street. AVild knew perfectly well everything of that kind that happened in what might be called the \" family\" world of London, as the thieves' slang had it ; and Mrs. Ripon and Mortification were not four-and-twenty hours in their new estabUsh ment before a report of the circumstance was duly made to Jonathan. \" Come out !\" cried Wild to the watchman. \" Eh ?\u2014 what did you say ?\" He knew exactly the number of their house, and halted before it now with certainty and pre cision. \"Come out, I say !\" \" If I do come out, I'll take you up. Come out, indeed ! You'ro a nice article, to cry out to a respectable watchman, who is always wide awake, except when he's having a Uttle nap Uke any other Christian !\" \" SUence ! Listen to me, and obey my or ders !\" It was a little, old, wretched, broken-down abode of only one storey in height, and yet it oc cupied more space lateraUy than many a flaunt ing, fashionable modern house of the present day. Very rudely over the shop-front appeared painted the words, \" Ripon, Dealer in Marino Stores.\" \" Yes,\" said Wild ; \" this is the crib. She's a clever woman that old Mother Ripon; but I wonder if old Mortification finds aU that praying answer ?\" The watchman looked amazed. \" You will take this horse, and lead him at once to the Mitre Inn, East Smithfield. Say he's mine, and put him up.\" \" Anything else ?\" said the watchman, with an ironical tone. \" No ; that is sufficient.\" \" And who may you be when you're at home ? Because it's just as weU I should know, as I in tend to lodge you in the Bound-house, and send your horse to the green-yard.\" WUd placed his ear flat against the shutters of the shop window. He heard, or thought he heard, a confused murmur of voices from within."], [140, "134 EDITH HERON. At a few paces off one of the wretched oil lamps with which London was then pretended to be lighted was fluttering, and flickering, and send ing some dubious rays about it. Wild stepped up to it ; and standing as much as possible within the sphere of its iUuminating power, he looked carefully to the priming of his pistols. by bit, thai there he should find the Baron Von Peck, against whom he had conceived a terrible hatred And so ho bethought him of a means of over coming tho obstruction of the door at the top of the stairs. His experiences soon enabled him to ascertain how it was fastened. \"Who knows?\" he muttered; \"this Baron Von Peck may show fight !\" \" A couple of bolts !\" he muttered. Had it been a hook, tbe work would have been much easier , but still Wild adopted a mode ot action which was tolerably successful, and the only drawback to which was, that it necessarily made some sUght noise. He set to work, with the assistance of his hanger, removing the lower panel of the door. It took him ten minutes. He replaced his pistols in his pocket, and in quite an easy way strolled back to Mrs Ripon's shop. He had quite made up his mind what to do, Close under the window was a flat iron grat ing, about three feet in length and two in width. Wild stooped down, and exerting all the strength he possessed, which was still consider able, when we consider the life of intemperance and riot he had led, he tugged at the old dilapi dated iron until it came away from its supports bodily in his hands. \" That'll do !\" he said. But he fully succeeded ; and, for a man of hi . bulk, ho crept through an exceedingly small space. He was fairly in the passage of the house. A faint light came through a half-glass door, which, no doubt, communicated with a back room adjoining the shop. The orifice beneath looked blank and fathom less. He heard a voice. He knew it was that of the Baron Von Peck ; and it was a thousand wonders that FeUx Heron, who was indeed there, and speaking, still kept up the assumed tones by which he personated the Baron. In reaUty, however, it was only about eight feet deep ; and WUd dropped into it with ease, bringing the grating into its place after him, and adjusting it so that to any casual passer-by it did not appear to have been disturbed. The hoUow area in which Wild found himself communicated with the dilapidated old house by a sort of kitchen window. Had he not laid it down as a matter of prin ciple that, whUo he wore the disguise, he would in no particular depart from the means of keeping it perfect, he would there and then have been tempted to converse in his natural tones, and WUd would havo been stricken with wonder and astonishment, to hear that the Baron Von Peck spoke in the accents of the supposed deceased Felix Heron. It was fastened, and there was a shutter within. But no burglar in all London, however accom plished he might be at his business, could at all compete with Jonathan AVUd in overcoming such obstacles to au entranco into a house where he wished to make his way. \" Then that is understood, Mrs. Bipon,\" were the words AVild overheard. \" Tom will be your frequent visitor ?\" In six or seven minutes Wild was in the kitchen. \"Yea,\" cried Mortification, \"as the Psalmist says, always keep the melting pot ready for the spoons of the Egyptians.\" \" Oh, indeed !\" muttered Wild, as he dived hia hand deep into one of the ample pockets of his coat, and slowly drew forth a pair of handcuffs. \"Oh, indeed ! WeU, it will go hard but I shall spoil your sport, Mr. Baron Von Peck.\" \" I'll get out the horses,\" said Tom Ripon, \"and we'll be off.\" It was damp and dismal. Indeed, it was a matter of courtesy to call it a kitchen, since probably many a long year had passed without it ever being used in that capacity, or any cheerful blaze iUuminating its grate, or dismal, damp precincts. It was intensely dark, likewise. But that was nothing to Wild. Of course he knew there was a door somewhere, and ho crept round tho walls, feeling them with his hands, damp and clammy as they were, till he came to it. \"No,\" replied what Wild thought was tho Baron Von Peck ; \" let them stay here a couple of hours. It will be safest for me to go home ou foot.\" Then he crept out into a dismal passage, and commenced the ascent of a flight of stairs that creaked so under his tread, and seemed so bodily to move beneath his footsteps, that he had a not iU-grounded apprehension they would all come down together, and bury him in their ruins. There was a door at tho top of these stairs, and that for a time appeared to bo tho most serious obstruction that AVild had yet met with. It was a provoking obstruction, too, because he certainly heard voices, and one of them he knew to be that of Mortification by its long drawling tones. \" Home, indeed !\" thought Wild. \" Why, the rascal's actually taken up his abode at AVliitcombe House ! Can it bo that she has been infatuated with him enough to marry him already ?\" \" Then I'll run out and see how Daisy is,\" said Tom. Tom Bipon was very quick in liis movements, and Jonathan Wild had only just time to dart away to the further end of the passage, where he half tumbled elown three or four steps, and found himseU in another room, the floor of which was littered with straw. Wild was not in a position, howover, to hear exactly what was said, and that made the matter more porploxing. WUd came to the conclusion at once that this was an extemporised stable for Daisy wheu hard pressed, but as Tom Ripon was reallycoming The conviction, howover, grew upon him, bit"], [141, "135 EDITH HERON. there, it was by no means an advisable place for him. door bell at this moment, aud the little party looked at each other in doubt to know wh_l they should do, or what was about to happen next. ignorant, however, as ho was of the topo graphy of the place, Jonathan WUd had no recourse but to hide himself as best ho could. lie had no wish to intertere with Tom Ripon , for, in fact, as the reader is aware, he had made a sort of compact with him to let him alone , so Wild felt along the walls ot this temporary stable until he tound a long coat or cloak \u2014 he knew not which at the moment exactly \u2014 hanging on a nail trom one of the walls. CHAPTER CCXXIII. THE UNEXPECTED VISITOR. \u2014 A SURPRISE. \u2014 FEI_IX HERON IN DANGER. He sUpped behind it as not a good hiding place, but the best that offered. Another moment, and Tom came in with a lantern. The impression on the mind of FeUx Hor\"n \u2014 and it was, under the circumstances, a most natural one \u2014 was that this appeal to tho beU in dicated the arrival of some of Jonathan WUd'a janissaries. \" Now, Daisy, my beauty !\" said Tom ; \" I don't ask you if you like your quarters, but I do hope you've eaten up that quartern loaf I crum bled down for you, and that you liked that pail of water with the pint of old ale in it. I haven't neglected you either, Charley ; and you know you've had something worth eating and drink ing.\" These last words Tom Ripon addressed to the other horse, for they were both there. Tom Ripon thought so likewise. But tho Rev. Mortification, with an eyo to busi- ness, was of a different opinion. \" Yea,\" he said, \" some individual who has been spoiUng the Egyptians wanteth to dispose of the swag !\" Mrs. Ripon caught at the idea in a moment \" Goodness gracious, yes!\" she cried. \" I never thought of that. Of course it is !\" Mrs. Bipon made a rush at the door leading into the shop, but Tom, who had no idea of aUowing his mother to let in any one so precipi tately, and felt how hopeless it would be to re call her by words, suddenly flung himseU down in her way, so that Mrs. Ripon came to an abrupt pause in consequence of tumbUng over him. \"There you go, old gal !\" said Tom. \"Yon shouldn't be in such a hurry.\" \" Oh, you odious little wretch !\" cried Mrs. Bipon; \"what do you mean?\" \"Get up \u2014 all's right. \"Now, Captain, give your orders. AVhat's to be done ?\" \"Yea,\" interposed the Rev. Mortification, \"if some individual has accidentaUy become possessed of some other individual's spoons, it is wrong to keep him waiting. Amen !\" Captain Heron glanced about him, and seeing a very capacious cupboard in the room with double doors, he pointed to it. \" Get in there, Tom, and I will follow you. If this arrival should bo one or more of tho bull-do p- s of Jonathan Wild, we must just fight the matter out; but if it be, as Mortification thinks, some customer to the 'fence,' wo wiU adopt another course.\" He then whistled for a few seconds, and was evidently patting Daisy on the neck. But AVild could not see him. The coat \u2014 for it was a coat, and one of Morti fication's \u2014 was thick and opaque, and Wild was afraid to move either it or himself, lest the sharp young ears or eyes of Tom Ripon should catch some indication of his presence. \" WeU, that'3 all right !\" said Tom. \" Good bye to both of you. I'll soon bo back. Don't quarrel.\" Tom left the stable, and Jonathan Wild heard him whistling as he went back to the room in which he had left Felix Heron, his mother, and Mortification. AVild thought it prudent to remain for a few minutes where he was, but he little suspected that during those sow minutes something very im portant was taking place in the back room of the \" fence.\" So soon as Tom fairly got into that room ho closed the door, and as noiselessly as possible shot a bolt into its socket. \" AVhat's the matter, Tom ?\" said Heron. Ho turned from bolting the door, and then they all saw that his face had a flush of excite ment upon it ; and he spoke in a low tone, say ing, \" There's somebody we know in tho stable along with Daisy and the other horse.\" \" Ah !\" cried Heron, as he sprang to his feet. \"Yea,\" said Mortification, \"I feel a presenti ment that it is an individual who has a propensity towards silver candlesticks ; and verdy he goeth by the unsavoury name of Mangy Dick. Susan nah Sarah AmeUa, my dove, open the door.\" \"Good gracious!\" said Tom, \"who are all they ?\" \" Ungrateful monster!\" said Mrs. Ripon ; \"you ought long ago to have found out where your mother was christened, and gone down on your knees and got the certificate, and then you'd have seen that those were my proper names.\" \" Oh, Lor' !\" said Tom, \" I never knowed it. I always thought the old gal's name was Tabby.\" \"What?\" Tom nodded. \"Who is it?\" \" WUd !\" \" Impossible '. You dream, Tom !\" \" No ; I saw his boots !\" \"Yea, the Philistines are upon us!\" said Mor- tification. \" I am a dead woman !\" said Mrs. Bipon. \" Get into the melting-pot, Mortification, at once ! Do !'\u2022 \"Yea,\" as the Psalmist says, ' that will be out of fire into tho frying-pan !' \" \" Silence !\" said FeUx Heron. \" This is per plexing !\" Tinkle, tinkle, came ? sharp ring at the shop \" T-a-b-b-y.\" Mrs. Ripon made a dart at Tom, who adroitly fled behind the Eev.

He made his way at once into the shop, which was very dark, although the candle was not ac tually extinguished by its fall, but lay upon the floor guttering and glimmering, and threatening momentary extinction. Heron's first movement was to raise it and re- Ught its wick. Then holding it above his head, he glanced about him, as he said, \"What is the meaning of aU this, and who have we here?\" \"Felix!\" cried a voice, \"can you forgive me?\" Felix Heron stepped into the deep recess with the folding-doors. Tom Ripon foUowed him. Mrs. Bipon, carrying the candle in her hand, crept through the front shop and took down a wooden bar that was across the door. \" Is it business ?\" she said. \"Yes,\" repUed a voice, \"if this is Mrs. Ripon's.\" \" To be sure,\" said Mrs. Ripon. \" I hope it's something worth having ; but money's so scarce we can't give much ; and there's a great f aU in the price of silver. It's only worth two shillings and three haUpence an ounce, so we can't give more than ninepence haUpenny and expect to Uve.\" The personage who had rung at the beU of Mrs. Ripon's \"fence\" crossed its threshold, and ex hibited himself to the deUghted eyes of that lady in the costume of a highwayman. Heron faintly staggered back with astonish ment. It was the voice of Edith. \"Edith! Edith!\" he exclaimed; \"surely it is I who dream now !\" \"No, Felix!\" she cried, as she flew forward and rested her hands upon his shoulders. \" No, Felix, it is I who have dreamt. Twice to-night vividly there came before me a vision of danger to you. I thought I saw you seated in a wretched room, and that a smaU circular orifice was opened in the top panel of a door, through which appeared the face of Jonathan Wild; and then so plainly did I see, in my sleep, that he presented a pistol at you with a full intent to take your Use, that the terror awakened me, and a voice seemed to cry in my ears, ' Seek him at Mrs. Ripon's, in Wardour street' Twice, FeUx, was this vision repeated. I could not rest, and you behold me here.\" \" It is something more than strange, Edith.\" \" Have I saved you ?\" \"Hush! Let me explain to you. Wild is here, and with my feeUngs towards him I know not how to extricate myself. Doubtless I could kill him with ease, but I can never now raise my hand against that man's lUe!\" \" Never, FeUx \u2014 not even in self-defence.\" \" No, my Edith ; for weU you know, in his rough, coarse manner, he is friendly and protec tive as regards you and our little one. It is the one touch of human feeling which redeems the monster, and I beUeve he would risk his own lUe at any moment for her whom he considers the widow of FeUx Heron and her chUd.\" The hat was puUed down low over the brows, and a roquelaire cloak hid a good deal of the dress, although sufficient of it could stUl be seen to leave no doubt that this personage was in verity a knight of the road. \"Bless you,\" said Mrs. Ripon, \"you go upon the high toby, I see; and I hope you've had plenty of luck. Times are hard in Wardour Street ; but for ready money this is the place to come. \" I have had a dream !\" said the stranger. \"A what?\" \" A dream ; and it is the strange impression which it has made upon me which has brought me here.\" \" Gracious powers !\" said Mrs. Bipon, putting the candle down upon the counter with a great jerk and a bang; \"what's the use of a dream? It's neither spangles, gUtter, nor rags !\" Mrs. Ripon meant gold, coin, jewels, and bank notes by these three slang expressions. \"Tell me, woman!\" said the stranger, \"have you seen aught to-night of one who calls himseU the Baron Von Peck ?\" \"Woman!\" cried Mrs. Ripon; \"woman to yourseU ! Who's a woman, I should like to know ? Marry come up, and fiddlededee ! My young spark, I'd have you to know \" \" Hush !\" said tho highwayman. He pushed the hat higher above his brow, and removed the coUar of the roquelaire from his chin. Edith pressed the hand of her husband fondly. \" Yes,\" she said, \" I well know that it is for my sake you forget and forgive aU the offences of Jonathan Wild.\" \" And for whose sake, in all this world, my Edith, should I do such an act, U not for you ?\" By this time, Mrs. Bipon had recovered suffi ciently from her downright fright at the sight of Edith, to mako her way into the baok room again. Mrs. Bipon uttered a scream, and upset the candle. At that moment Jonathan Wild tried tho door leading into the passage, and which Tom had prudently bolted. Captain Heron stepped a pace out of tho recess with a pistol in his hand ; and tho Rev. Mortifi cation, upon hearing the scream, darted at onco under the table and hid himself. \" Mortification ! Mortification ! You hardened wretch !\" she cried, \" where is the cherry brandy?\" \"Yea, here !\" exclaimed Mortification, as ho made a sudden dart from under the table ; and for tho third time, by coming into alarming eon tact with Mrs. Ripon's feet, ho brought her to the floor. Then all was still. Had Mrs. Ripon fainted ? Was it possible that she had seen the counte nance of any ono that could have such an effect upon her? \" Murder !\" \" Fire !\" cried Mortification. Jonathan Wild tapped at the door again that It seemed probable.

No. 70. \u2014 Edith."], [144, "138 EDITH HERON. \" It is no risk, Felix ! I feel in no danger from Jonathan Wild.\" carrying at its other extremity a small, sharp, ex quisitely tempered short cutting blade. A rapid motion round the gimlet as a centre, would, in a few seconds, suffice to take out a circular piece of woodwork of an inch iu thick ness. It was evident that Heron shrank from thus substituting Edith for himself ; but the circum stances were so pecuUar, that it was no discredit to his manhood so to do. This was just what WUd was about. The grinding motion was like the humming of a bee, and as it proceeded, Mrs. Ripon looked at Mortification, and kept his garruUty in check. As for herself, the necessity for sUence pro duced as much effect upon her, and induced her to keep her Ups so closely compressed, that her very breathing occasioned a noticeable sound. Edith's heart beat strangely, as she thus felt that her dream was coming true in its minutest particular. In truth and reaUty, it was for the purpose of saving the life of Jonathan Wild ; for, situated as lie was, nothing would have been easier for Heron than to have sacrificed the great thief-taker to his own safety and the exigencies of that night of adventure. How singularly changed were all the circum stances connected with Heron and WUd ! The latter sought the lUe of the supposed Baron Von Peck from sheer respect and con sideration for the memory, as he called it, of the late Earl of Whitcombe. Tom Bipon stood looking on, a pleased and observant spectator of all that was taking place in that miserable little apartment at the back of the fence. And Felix Heron skulked from WUd like a timid criminal, not from any fear of him, but from tho dread of being forced to kiU or injure him in seU-defence. The strange noise continued on the upper panel of the door. Jonathan WUd was evidently making progress, and probably he was as surprised as any one that no immediate notice was taken of what he was about, and that he was permitted to work so easily at that door without remark or interruption. Suddenly there was a sUght creaking sound, followed by a light blow. The circular piece of the panel had come out. Jonathan WUd at once projected a pistol through the opening into the room. He spoke in a loud, harsh voice. \" Baron Von Peck, you are my prisoner ! Stir hand or foot, and I wUl blow out your brains.\" \" Ah !\" cried Edith, as if taken by surprise. \" Yes,\" added Jonathan, \"your little career has come to an end ; and I wUl not only rid society of you, but likewise savo tho Countess of Whit combe from the commission of a foUy ; for I verily believe she would mako you, otherwise, the unworthy successor of FeUx Heron.\" Edith did not answer this speech, but she still sat by the table, as though transfixed with fear at the threat that Jonathan Wild had uttered. A moment's consideration convinced Edith that Tom's plan of operations was the very best that, under the circumstances, could be pursued. \" Consent to this, FeUx,\" she said, \" and all may yet be well.\" \"You wish it, Edith?\" \" With all my heart. And you wUl be at hand, too, in case any change comes over the spirit of this man. Two steps wiU bring you to my side.\" \" It is so,\" said Heron, as he hastily laid down tho hat, and took the cravat from his own neck \" Let us try this plan further to mystify Jonathan Wild.\" The hat was a peculiar one. It was looped up on one side with an ornament of jet, and had a long, drooping feather, which partly shaded the countenance of the wearer. And now, when Edith had folded the cravat round her neck, hiding her chin and the lower part of her face likewise in its thick folds, and when she seated herself at the table, with the hat upon hor head, and rested her cheek upon her hand, sho bore a very tolerable resemblance to the supposed Baron Von Peck. \" Tom Bipon,\" cried Wild, \" where are you ? The game's up. Open this door. I have nothing to say to you ; but your new master must pass the remainder of this night in Newgate.\" Captain Heron retreated into tho recess, pulling tho door after him. \" Now, Tom,\" he whispered, \"let in WUd.\" \" There's no occasion, Captain ; he's at work ; let him come in his own way.\" \" Bo it so.\" Tom made his appearance. \" You're mistaken, Jonathan Wild,\" he said, \" and wUl be sorry for what you are doing.\" \" Not at all,\" said WUd. \" I am only sorry I've not sent a bullet at once into the thick skull of tho Baron Von Peck. We've enough to do with our English high-flyers and knights of the road, without having any foreign ones among us.\" It would seem that Edith's dream was about to be fulfilled to the letter, for a strange grating noise was heard upon one of the panels of the door. If Edith had been as weU acquainted with the tools and weapons of housebreakers as Mrs. Ripon and the Rev. Mortification were, she would have come to tho conclusion that WUd was using a well-known implement among the fraternity, by which a circular piece of panel from any door or wall could be removed with great easo in a few seconds. \" Open the door,\" said Edith, in a low tone. \" That's the most sensiblo speech you've made yet, Baron,\" added Wild. Tom Ripon stepped up to tho door, and shot back the bolt. Jonathan AVUd strode into the apartment, and laid his band heavily upon tho shoulders of tho supposed Baron, as he said in his harshest and most grating tones, \" You are my prisoner ! Re sistance wUl be madness and folly ! Be so good as to hold up your hands, and I will fit you with a The machinery was simple.

WUd staggered back as though he had been shot. \" Ib this from you,\" added Edith, \" whom I took to be my friend?\" \" Edith !\" he gasped ; \" the Countess !\" \" Look at her again, Johnny,\" said Tom Ripon, \" and make sure.\" Wild turned round twice, and fairly staggered about the room, until he came to a chair, upon which he sat down, with a concussion that nearly started all its joints. \" Stop a bit !\" he cried ; \" stop a bit ! It's either a dream, or I'm mad !\" \" Yea, thou hast said it ; and if there were no thieves \" \" There would be no officers,\" added Wild. '-' Amen!\" \u00a3aid Mortification. WUd crossed the shop, and banged the outer door after him as he left the premises. \" FoUow,\" said FeUx Heron, in a low voice, from the recess; \"foUow him, Ttom \u2014 he's up to some trick.\" CHAPTER CCXXIV. \"AU's right, Captain. Mother, where aro you ?\" \" I am here, you unnatural wretch !\" \" Lend us one of those mob caps of yours, and the bundle of rags you call a gown.\" \"Oh, the viUain!\" cried Mrs. Ripon; \"ho wants to personate a respectable female, and bring the sex into disrepute.\" \" Yea, he is a viUain !\" added Mortification ; \" and the day will not be far distant when he will execute what profane people caU a dance upon nothing; for, astlie Psalmist truly observes \" \"Murder! Help! Murder!\" Mrs. Ripon had made active use of the samo candlestick with which Tom had aroused Wild to a consciousness of his wakening existence ; and the unfortunate Mortification experienced such an assault and battery, first on one side of his head, and then on the other, with the tin weapon, that ho thought himself in a kind of pUlory, where he was continually pelted by old candlesticks. JONATHAN WILD PERPLEXED. \u2014 TOM'S ENJOYMENT AT HIS CONFUSION. Tom Ripon enjoyed immensely the perplexity of Jonathan WUd, and looked at him with un affected delight, as he sat upon tho ricketty old chair into which he had staggered, pressing his hands over his eyes, to try to convince himseU he was not awake. \"Speak to me \u2014 speak to me!\" cried Wild, \u2014 \"some one speak to me, or do something to assure me that this is not a dream !\" Tom Ripon stepped up to him, and inflicted a sharp lack upon his shin. \" Will that do, Johnny ?\" \"Villain!\" \" Try that, then !\" said Tom. An old, empty tin candlestick was close at hand, and, by reversing it, Tom was able to hit Wild a sharp crack on the head. Jonathan sprung to his feet, and made a grasp at Tom, who dodged him, however, and got in safety round the table. \" Hold!\" cried Edith. \"What is the meaning of all this ? TeU me, Jonathan Wild, what you want with me ; and why, contrary to all pro mises aud expectations, you hunt me down to night ?\" \"Take that!\" said Mrs. Ripon. \"And I'll have you to know that if Tom thinks proper to put on a mob cap and one of my dresses, who has a greater right ? Eh, you thin wretch ?\" Tom was immensely amused at this fracas, and, as far as he was concerned, put an end to it, by snatching the cap off his mother's head, and then rushing into the shop and helping himself to one of the dresses there ostensibly hanging for sale ; and so, rapidly attiring himself in a costume that might in the dark pass muster as a feminine one, he left the fence as a spy upon the actions of Jonathan Wild. \"I don't know,\" said WUd. \"But I will ask of you but one question ; and without Baying that it wUl be far better for you to give me a truthful answer, I warn you that, if you do not, I must find one for myself.\" \"What is it? I will give you a truthful an swer.\" Tom was gono about a quarter of an hour ; but when he returned it was with the information that WUd had got into a hackney coach, and actually gone home. \" He's done up for to-night, Captain,\" said Tom ; \" so we can bring out Daisy, and make our way to AVhitcombe House.\" \" At once\u2014 at once !\" cried Heron ; \" for, after aU, he may only be going to Newgate Street to get assistance.\" Tom Ripon, with the assistance of Mortifica tion, got out the horses, and Felix Heron assists 1 Edith to mount Daisy. The distance was but short to Whitcombe \"Is there such a person as the Baron Von Peck?\" \" There is.\" \"That's a relief,\" said Jonathan. \"Now for another question, \u2014 Do you intend to marry him?\" \" Perhaps.\" \" That means ' Yes ' from a woman. Now, listen to me, Countess! That rascally old Von Peck shaU never bo father-in-law to FeUx Heron's child while there is such a place as Ty burn Gate, and such a person as Jonathan WUd !

Edith was of opinion that the disguise should be completely abandoned, so that the Baron, as an individuality, should disappear from the face of the earth. This letter was despatched to Wild's house, and in the course of two hours an answer came back, addressed to the Baron. \" Then, Edith,\" he said, \" I should have to ap pear in some new disguise immediately, and which I might find it more difficult to maintain than this.\" It was as brief as possible : \u2014 \"Go, and be hanged!

I am quite convinced that, let him once think I have given up all hopes of marrying the Baron Von Peck, and one haU of his spite and indignation will vanish.\" \" It can be tried. What say you to this, Edith, as a plan for carrying out your ideas? Suppose I, as the Baron Von Peck, make a communication that I am wUling to leave England at once and for ever, if permitted to do so by him, without hindrance or interruption?\" \" Yes, that will, do.\" \" I can then be back here in the course of twelve hours, in another character.\" She wrote him a note in the following words : \u2014 \" If Jonathan Wild at all values tho good opinion which, in one solitary respect, tho Coun tess of AVhitcombe has of him, he will let the Baron Von Peck depart from England in peace, since she, the Countess, is quite certain that he never intends to return.\" Wild called at Whitcombe House within an hour, and saw Edith. \"Let him go,\" he said; \"but let this be the last I shall ever hear of such a rascal aspiring to the hand of the widow of FeUx Heron.\" \" And what character will you assume, Felix?\" \" I was once acquainted with an old officer in the navy, of the name of Fantome, and so marked were his peculiarities, that I do not think I should have the sUghtest difficulty iu successfully per sonating such a man.\" \" Be it so \u2014 be it so, Felix. This supposed Cap tain Fantome, then, Jonathan WUd could have no charge against; aud at the risk even of some loss of reputation, and some remarks upon my sup posed folly, why should I not publicly marry Captain Fantome, so that you might be here at all times, without question, remark, or sus picion ?\" \" It shall be so, Edith, and I will set about this plan of operations at once.\" Heron was well pleased to effect this change in his condition, and during the day he wrote the following letter to Jonathan AVild : \u2014 All this being arranged on the Monday morn ing in question, Felix Heron rode down to Gravesend, accompanied by Tom Bipon. They put up at a Uttle hostel about half a mile from the town, and there Heron left Tom with the horses and a weU filled valise, which contained the new disguise that Heron intended to adopt. The Hamburgh packet lay about half a mile out in the stream, a Uttle below TUbury Fort ; and as Captain Heron stepped into a wherry to be taken on board, carefully disguised still as the Baron Von Peck, he saw Jonathan AVild leaning against a post on the little quay from whence the boat took its departure. Not a word was exchanged between them, but AVild kept his eyes on the supposed Baron until he gained the deck of the packet, which, in an other quarter of an hour, lifted its anchor and set its sails to a breeze whicli carried it rapidly down the river. \"To Mr. Wild, at his house in Newgate Street. \" The Baron Von Peck cannot but feel how useless it is to enter into a prolonged contest, with the great Jonathan AVild. \" The Baron, therefore, is willing to compro mise matters, so far as to give up all pretensions to the hand of the Countess of AVhitcombe, if Heron dived down to the chief cabin of tho packet, and after the bustle of getting tho little vessel under weigh was over, he reqv__steel an audience of the captain. \" Circumstances,\" lie saiel, \" render it necessary that I should return to London; therefore, on Jonathan AVild will abstain from all persecution"], [147, "141 EDITH HERON. consideration that I pay you for ray full passage, and Ukewise for any delay that may be occa sioned in putting me on shore, I trust there wiU be no difficulty in lauding me quicldy.\" The captain demuircd a little, but as Heron threw upon the table between them some gold pieces that covered at least three times over aU that he could reasonably be charged, the diffi culties vanished. Peck, or were to see anything in the Captain Fantome I cow mean to call myself, that re minded him of Felix Heron, he would only look upon it as one of those accidental resemblances that are in no way to be accounted for.\" \" But, Captain !\" \" Well, Tom ?\" \" What are we to do as regards our little af fairs on the road ? You don't mean, I hope, to give up business altogether?\" \" Certainly not, Tom.\" \" Then who are we to be, and what are we to be, when we cry ' Stand and deliver ? ' \" \"Look at me, Tom, and then I shall be able to explain to you my intentions. You know that as tho Baron Von Peck I wore a suit of clothes that were thickened and padded so as to make me appear half as bulky again as I am iu reality.\" At the dusk of evening, Heron was put on shore at Southend, to make his way back to Gravesend and to Tom Bipon as best he might. He hired a little fishing vessel, and about half past ten o'clock on that night he was with Tom Ripon at tho small suburban hostel where that faithful foUower, with no smaU anxiety, awaited him. \"Now, Tom,\" said Heron, \"this disguise must be more perfect than the last, and must differ from it os largely as possible.\" \" Yes, Captain, but it can't be much better ; for sometimes when I looked at you, while you used to call yourseff the Baron von Peck, I hardly knew you myseU.\" Heron smiled ; for, in his own estimation, he considered tho disguise that he was now about to attempt would be a much more perfect and ar tistic thing than the former one. At the period of whicli we write the different professions, mUitary, naval, lay, and clerical, were much more accurately distinguished the one from the other by even the costumes of ordinary life than they are at present. \" Yes, Captain, you looked about twice the weight and size of yourself.\" \"Well, you see, Tom, I am not depending upon any such plan in my disguise as Captain Fantome, of the royal navy ; so I shall have no difficulty in putting on at any moment over this dress the whole of the costu'.ne of the Baron Von Peek, previously divesting it of its padding, which wiU not be required when its goes over another complete suit.\" \" I begin to see \u2014 I begin to unelerstand,\" said Tom. Heron laughed. \" I think you do, Tom. I shall still cry ( Stand and deUver !' on the highway, as the Baron Von Peck, but I shall trot quietly home as Captain Fantome.\" A man iu the army or navy never, under any circumstances, entirely laid aside his uniform. He might not wear it with aU the exactitude of actual service, but still there it was, something after the fashion of our clergy of the present day, who carry into private Use a clerical costume, by which they may always bo distinguished. From tho vaUse, then, that he brought with him, Captain Heron took such a complete suit as would entirely change his outward appearance. He succeeded likewise in imparting a totally different colour to his complexion, by the use of an extract from the Spanish chesnut, which had been taught him by a tribe of gipsies with whom at one timo he had sojourned for a few weeks. This, in addition to a wig, which concealed every fragment of his natural hair, made him look so very different that it would have re quired great intimacy with him to know him. By affecting a stoop, then, in his gait, and an awkward, difficult walk, as though he were balancing himself on the unsteady planks of a vessel's deck, Heron very weU sustained tho cha racter he had assumed. \"Now, what do you think of it, Tom?\" he eaid. \"Capital!\" said Tom; \"wo shall have some fun, and, U we don't drive Jonathan AVild mad. it wUl be no fault of ours !\" CHAPTER CCXXV. CAPTAIN FANTOME AND HIS EOY, PETER, EN- COUNTER JONATHAN WILD ON THE ROAD TO LONDON. Fflix Heron had no intention of remaining a moment longer at Gravesend then necessary. But stiU it was requisite to proceed to town with some amount of caution, inasmuch that Jonathan Wild was of so crafty and suspicious a nature, that there was every probabUity of en countering him on the road. \" It is necessary, Tom,\" said Captain Heron, \" that you Ukewise should be disguised, or your presence with me will beget a thousand conjec tures and suspicions in the mind of Wild, whicli it would be well to avoid !\" \" It's capital ! I shouldn't know you myself, Captain.\" \" And yet,\" said Heron, \" I feel that the prin cipal security I have in these disguises from tho keen, scrutinising eyes of Jonathan AVild consists in the fact that he never expects under any cir cumstances whatever to discover Felix Heron beneath them.\" \" I don't know how I'm to manage that, Cap tain !\" \" Look further into tho valise, Tom, and you'U see that I have not forgotten 3'ou !\" FeUx Heron had carefully packed this travel ling receptacle himseU, so that Tom Ripon had no knowledge of what was in it. Upon diving into its inmost recesses, however, in obedience to the order of Heron, Tom fished out a complete suit of clothes, suitable for him self, and such as might bo worn by a boy-groom \" You think so, Captain.\" \" I am certain of it, Tom. AVild believes I am dead, and, therefore, never looks out for me; aud if he saw anything ev<*u iu the Baron Vou"], [148, "142 EDITH HERON. miserable hacks usually in tho habit of dfstwing tho open chaise. The saddles aud bridles woro eUsposed snugly insido, and the boy trotted back to Gravesend with his horses, well pleased with the crown piece Heron gave to him. \"Now, Tom, for London!\" \" All's right, Captain.\" of the period, somewhat answering to the descrip tion of tho modern \" tiger.\" Tom Bipon shook his head. \"It's all very well, Captain,\" he said, \"but Jonathan Wild will know me !\" \" Look a little further, Tcm, and you will find a smaU parcel !\" Tom Ripon did so, and discovered that it con tained a Ught flaxen-looking wig, which would convert him at once into a thorough specimen of a Saxon youth. Off they went. Heron had paid his score Uberally at the Uttle hostel, but tho landlord and his wUe stood at the door gazing after him and Tom Ripon in undis guised astonishment. They had taken but a cursory glanco at their guests on their arrival, but tho impression on their minds that the two peoplo who had started away in the open chaise were not tho samo two who had arrived on horseback, was too strong to admit of contradiction. Tom's hair was naturally dark, and he woro it cropped close. He said he did that in order to save troublo in case he was captured by AVild, and sent to prison, where he knew that tho first operation would be to cut his hair. He was just arriving, too, at that time of Use when the colour of early youth was deserting his cheeks. This was just one of those incidents that Felix Heron expected; but ho saw no easy way to guard against it, so he let it tako its chance. He knew weU that no human arrangement could be quite perfect in all its particulars. The two horses carried them on swiftly, and about one-haU of the distance from Gravesend to London \u2014 that is to say, something over ten miles \u2014 was traversed before they became aware of a horseman in advance of them, who suddenly drew up, and dismounted by tho road-side. The horseman Ufted a foro foot of his horse, and, by the hammering sound that ho made, it was evident that he was knocking out a stone which the horse had picked up, and which, pro bably, had lamed him. \" Caution, Tom !\" whispered Heron. Tom, with his mouth open, looked at Heron, and, in a whisper, pronounced tho name of Jonathan Wild. In fact, Tom Ripon was getting decidedly sallow, which would continue to be his natural complexion. In a smaU glass that was in the dressing-room at tho hostel, Tom admired himseU exceedingly with the flaxen wig. But stUl he felt that there was a something wanting, for the artificial hair did not look as if it naturaUy belonged to his complexion. \" Look a Ut-tle further, Tom,\" said Heron, \" and you'll see a smaU earthenware jar, and in it you'll find your new face. It will do you no harm, as it is but some powdered earth of the requisite colour.\" Tom Bipon was deUghted. In the little jar or gallipot that FeUx Heron pointed out to him, he found some finely powdered, reddish-looking earth ; and when he had rubbed that over his face it gave him a complexion that exactly assimUated with the flaxen wig. \" Yes,\" added Heron, . it is he, and then could not be possibly a better opportunity of testing our disguises.\" \" But, Captain !\" \" WeU, what is it ?\" \" If the worst should come to tho worst, ami Jonathan WUd should bo particularly disagreeable, you've no objection, I suppose, to me giving him a buUet ?\" The change in Tom Ripon was very complete, and it is doubtful if either his mother or the Rev. Mortification, even knowing him so well as they did, could possibly have recognised him. \" Now, Tom,\" said Heron, \" we won't go to town on horseback, because both our horses might be well known to Jonathan AVUd and his janissaries.\" \"How then? Good gracious, Captain, you don't mean to leave Daisy hero ?\" ' Certainly not. You wiU wait here for me, rind I wUl go into the town of Gravesend, and manage to hire a pair-horse carriage of some sort. We wiU then dispenso with tho horses that may be already in it, aud let Daisy and your horse take us to London.\" \" SeU-preservation, Tom, is the first law of nature ; but let us hope it will not come to that And mind, when you speak, do so as a country boy.\" \" I wiU.\" \" If you play your part well, it is imp ho oan suspect you.\" Heron had by no means relaxed in tho pace at which ho was driving, which was ordinarily fast, but not so fast as to give the impression of any hurry. He thought it bettor to pass WUd without tak ing any notico of him, and was about doing so, when tho thief-taker looked up and called out. \" That's the thing, Captain ! AVhy, wo may give Jonathan Wild a Uft if we should happen to meet him, and he would be none the wiser.\" \" That would be a hazardous oxperiment, Tom ; although, on my faith, I think it ruight bo done.\" Heron left Tom at tho hostel, and walked rapidly to Gravesend, where he easUy succeeded in hiring an open carriage by paying handsomely for the use of it, and promising to leave it at a particular Uvery stables in London that was in constant communication with Gravesend. \" I don't know who you may be, sir, but you may do me a favour.\" Heron puUed up. \"AVhat is it?\" he said. \"My horse has faUen dead lame. He picked up a stono in his foot, and it has cut him. I don't like to rido the beast ; so, if you aro going towards London, and can give mo a cast, I wiU tio my horse's rein to the back of your chaise, and ho A boy drove him back to tho hostel, and by Ids assistance Daisy anel Tom's horeo were easily ac_ commodated in tho harness of tho two ratho"], [149, "143 EDITH HERON. won't hurt half so much with no weight upon him as U I were to ride him.\" I am no highwayman, by telUng you who I really am.\" Heron considered for a moment Should he, or should he not, run tho fearfid risk of taking Wild as a companion actually into tho chaiso ? \" Hoist your colours, then. What ship ahoy ?\" \" My name is Jonathan Wild.\" According to custom, WUd, when ho uttered his own name, always made one of his hideous demoniac faces. No, it was too much. So close a proximity would give the disguises, tho wigs, and the false colour on their faces no fair chance. But in this case ho was greatly disappointed, for neither the name nor the face had the slightest effect upon the supposed sea captain and his agri cultural boy, Peter. \"Jonathan who did you say?\" asked Heron. \" WUd\u2014 WUd.\" \" I am an officer in his Majesty's service,\" said Heron ; \" and strike my topsails U I can pick up every chance feUow on the road with a lame horse.\" \" Oh, very weU ; I can't help it.\" \"He do look main wild,\" said Tom, \u2014 \"for aU the world loike our black bull, as tossed Mrs. Crump, on the common, 'cos \" \" Bah ! Bo !\" roared WUd. \" Idiot, who want? to hear about you and your black bull. Can it be possible that you have never heard of Jonathan Wild?\" \" I, too, am an officer in his Majesty's service,\" added AVild, with a sneer ; \"and birds of a feather you know, my good sir, ought to flock together.\" \" I don't understand your ehore-going Ungo,\" said Heron, keeping up his character as a naval officer. \"Peter, what do you think of this feUow?\" \" Why, maister,\" said Tom, \" I've been more used to cows ; and ho do rather mind me of our black bull at home, as was named Vicious, and tossed old Mother Crumpet, 'cos she would go across the common in her red cloak.\" Heron shook his head. \" No,\" said Tom ; \" never heard o' he, and don't want.\" \"WeU,\" said Wild, as ho drew a long breath, \" this beats everything. I am much obUged to you, sir ; and it may be that you and Jonathan Wild will become better acquainted some day.\" \" I doubt it.\" \" Then you don't Uke him, Peter ?\" \" No, maister.\" \" Nor moro do I ! So on we saU again !\" \"Confound you,\" muttered Wild, \"for a sea bear!\" \" And for your information, I teU you that I am the great Jonathan AVUd \u2014 the well-known thief-taker and officer \u2014 the terror of evU-doers \u2014 and a man as weU known in London as the Monument.\" Heron gave the rein to tho two horses, and trotted on. He and Tom both thought that they had got effectually rid of Jonathan AVild; but iu that they were reckoning without their host, for such was very far indeed from being the fact. They had hardly gone threo mUes further when ho camo up to them again at a sharp trot. \" Can't help it,\" said Heron. \" Nothing to do with it. Never sailed in my ship. Como on, Peter.\" Heron jerked tho reins, and tho two horses set off at increased speed. Jonathan AVild did not mako any positive attempt to foUow the chaise, although they heard that ho was on the road behind them, coming on at a good pace. This timo ho was mounted on a grey horse, whereas tho one that had faUen lame was a dark bay. \" Well, Mr. Officer,\" cried AVUd, as ho reined iu abreast of the chaise ; \" I am able to got on without being indebted to your courtesy !\" Heron made no reply. But Jonathan, for once in a way, was inclined to be garrulous, and he kept exact paco with tho chaise, as he added, \" I was able to leave my lame horso at tho King's Head Inn, by tho wayside, and borrow this ono. So now, Captain, if you are a Captain, I'd liko to know your name !\" \" You'ro an insolent ruffian !\" said Heron. \" Shiver my timbers ! if I don't believe you're a highwayman!\" \" Perhaps I am !\" \" Oh, very weU ! Peter !\" \" Yes, maister !\" \"Preparo for action ! Bun out the guns!\" \" Here yo arc, maister !\" Tom Ripon handed to Captain Heron his pistols, which had been placed at the bottom of tho chaise ready for use. \"Now, Mr. Highwayman, clear your decks,\" added Heron, \" and let's have it out yard-arm to yard-arm.\" \"Nonsense !\" said WUd ; \" I was but jesting.\" 11 1 don't understand jokes on the high seas \u2014 I mean, in tho highways.\" \" We have baffled him for tho present, Tom,\" said Heron. \" Bather,\" repUed Tom Bipon. \" I am glad wo have met him,\" added Heron ; \" inasmuch as it affords a good test to our dis guises, which have been singularly successful.\" \"But what are wo to do next, Captain ?\" \" We shall proceed directly home, whether Jonathan WUd watches us or not. And yet a thought strikes me that I should liko to puzzle him a littlo further to-day, and send him to London, more full of doubt and wonderment than he has ever been. \"I should like to do that, too,\" said Tom, \"but I don't see how.\" Captain Heron was driving the chaiso and pair, and as Tom spoke, he turned tho horses' heads down a shadowy lane to the left. \" Open the vaUse, Tom,\" said Heron, \" and 1 will put over this costume the rather capacious, clothes of the Baron Von Peck ; and as for you, you can Inde yourseff in the lane.\" Tom was quite dehghted at one part of this arrangement, but not at the other. That Captain Heron meant to mystify and enrage Jonathan WUd by committing a highway robbery in tho dress of tho Baron Von Peck, ):o considered a capital thing. \" Well, weU, sir ! I will soon satisfy you that"], [150, "144 EDITH HERON. But what vexed him was that he should be out of it. compound of a female horse-jockey and an amazon. There was no resource, however, but to do just as Captain Heron required, and in a few seconds Daisy was released from the traces ; and Heron having slipped on, over his dress as Captain Fantome, the rather remarkable and capacious suit of clothes that distinguished the Baron Von Peck, mounted, and was ready for the road. \"You remain here, Tom,\" he said, \"just as you are, and take care of the chaise.\" \" All right, Captain, I'll do it ; but I hope on the next occasion you'U manage that I shaU be with you!\" \" I will try to do so.\" Heron at a hand gallop reached the road again. Scarcely had he done so, when he heard the sound of wheels, and he saw an ordinary hack post-chaise coming along in the direction towards London. It was either her natural voice or an assumed one in which she spoke, but it was mascuUne in the extreme. Take her for all in all, she was just the kind of female that FeUx Heron had a perfect abhorrence of. And yet he had a disinclination to stop and rob on the highway anything in the shape of a woman, let her be as unfeminine as she might be ; and he hesitated for a few seconds, as the lady glared at him from the coach window, and then cried out, \" HUloa, you sir ! what do you mean by stop ping my postUion ? I've half a mind to come out and lay my riding whip over your shoulders.\" \" That might be a hazardous experiment, madam,\" repUed Heron, \"for human patience has its limits; and, moreover, example is contagious.\" \" What do you mean, insolent?\" \" I mean that since you have evidently forgotten that you are a lady, I might forget it likewise, aud then you would fare but badly.\" \" Wait a moment \u2014 we'll soon see about that\" Heron was not disposed to pick and choose his adventures, and this one, for aught he knew, might be as desirable as any. It was broad daylight ; and probably the persons in the chaise had about as little idea of b.ing stopped by a highwayman, as of any one dropping from the moon upon them. The spot, however, at which Heron appeared was a romantic one, aud, in that respect, was in every way adapted for an adventure. Some chalk bUls, through which a cutting had been made, rose up on one side to a height of some eighty to a hundred feet \u2014 the fissures in the chalk, and little plateaux accidentaUy left, being filled and crowded with coarse vegetation. CHAPTER CCXXVI. THE STRONG-MINDED WOMAN MEETS HER MATCH. THE BILLET DOUX. The mascuUne woman made an effort to open the door of the post-chaise, and might doubtless have done so but that she was partially prevented by some one within, who remonstrated with her iu low, timid tones. The road itseU was but a rough and uneven one, so that it was a matter of necessity that anything upon wheels should make but slow pro gress. \"AmeUa, my love! \u2014 really, now, Amelia my love ! do not give way to your fine high spirits to such a degree. Bemember how precious and valuable you are !\" Heron was quite deUghted to find that some one else was in the post-chaise as weU os the mascu line lady. \" Halt !\" cried Heron, as he reached the side of thc chaise. . \"Goodness gracious! What's the matter?\" said the postUion. \" There's a highwayman on the road !\" \" Is there, sir ? Where is he ?\" He rode up to the door in a moment, aud look ing in, he saw that her companion was a small, Ught sandy-looking man, with such immense whiskers, that scarcely more than the tip of his nose and two ferret-looking eyes were visible be tween them. \" Here !\" added Heron, as he presented a pistol at the head of the postUion ; \" and he advises you to keep perfectly quiet if you value your life.\" \" Murder !\" \" You may call what you Uke, so that you hold in your horses.\" \" AVhat is all this ?\" cried a voice from the in side of the chaise, as one of the windows was let down violently, and to Heron's surprise \u2014 for the voice was decidedly mascuUne in its tones \u2014 a woman's face appeared. That this was man and wUe Heron at once concluded, but bis attention was quickly drawn off from all other subjects by the lady making several slashes at him with a small riding whip through the open window. \" Amelia, my love !\" remonstrated the gentle man with the whiskers \u2014 \"now, reaUy, AmeUa, my love, you are too deUeate and tender for all this ! Do not let your high spirits run away with you.\" Felix Heron had to watch his opportunity to snatch hold of the riding-whip, and wrench it from tho hands of Amelia. \" AVhat is the meaning of all this ? Drive on, feUow, or I will soon teach you what it is to trifle with me.\" There was no difficulty in seeing the kind of lady it was who uttered theso words. She was one of those females who, from their size and physical proportions, are received by the great mass of society as fine women \u2014 the terms fine and coarse always being completely trans posed when applied to feminine humanity. The face was large, fat, and insolent. Tho eyes were bold and staring. And the costume of this hxdy was as unlady like as it possibly could be, and seemed a \"Come, come, madam,\" he said, \"enough of this. You have already exhibited yourseU iu such colours tbat the name of Amelia will ever be one abhorrent to me, since it wiU remind me of you.\" The fine woman uttered a scream of rage. The gentleman with the whiskers remon strated."], [151, "EDITH HERON. 145 \"Really, sir,\" he said, \"whether you are a highwayman or not, I must say that I am per fectly astonished at your words. This is the most amiable and lovely of her sex, and uni versally acknowledged to be the finest woman in all The deuce !\" ance of sorviUty on one side and tyranny oi the other. His pity for the abject and forlorn condition of the gentleman with the whiskers was almost lost in contempt that any man could put up with tho freaks of such a virago. \"Quick, sir!\" he cried, impatiently. \"I want your money !\" \" Then you are a highwayman ?\" said the gen tleman with the whiskers, timidly, as he stUl rubbed his ear. The amiable and lovely AmeUa having been Bummarily deprived of her riding-whip by FeUx Heron, dealt the gentleman with the whiskers such a box on the car with her right hand that it seemed haU enough to tako his head off. \" Take that !\" she said ; \" and speak when you're spoken to ! AVho told you to inter fere ?\" \" As you please, sir, at your service ! I want your purse, watch, and jeweUery! Quick, quick !\" \" Bless you, Mr. Highwayman, I never havo any purse, watch, nor jeweUery !

AmeUa, as she raised her other hand to inflict a box on the other ear of the wretched personage she so completely triumphed over. That hand, however, happened to be nearest tho carriage window where FeUx Heron was, and by stretching forward his right arm he caught it by the wrist. \" Shame, madam !\" he said, \u2014 \"shame and dis grace to your sex ! What devil has possession of you, that you can thus act ?\" The lady made vigorous efforts to release her wrist from Heron's grasp, but she might just as well have attempted to have 'got out of an iron vice. \" Then I must, Amelia !\" \" Wait tiU wo get home !\" s_id Mrs. Broom. \" There, that's it !\" said Broom. \" Tliat's what I expected. '.' She'll shut me up in the back kitchen, on bread aud water, for three days for this !\" \" Never mind,\" said Heron. \" You know sho'3 the finest woman in all Paddington.\" \" Yes, she is \u2014 she is. Oh, Amelia ! You soe I can't help it ! This highwayman is peremptory. I must give him the puee^e !\" \" If you were half a third of a man,\" said Mrs. Broom, \" you would fight him, while you had a, drop of blood in your veins !\" \" But don't you hear, my dear, he talks of hie companions? And if there are only two of them, I had need to be three men to fight them.\" \" But you might fight them all, and distinguish yourself !\" \" Extinguish myself, you mean, Ameha. There, my good sir \u2014 there's the purse. Dear me ! What's this ? A note to Mrs. Amelia Broom \u2014 with Wiggins in the corner ! Why, that's the great fishmonger on the Ge*een !\" Mrs. Broom uttered a shriek. \" Read it,\" said Herou, \" noev you have it.\" \" On your life, I dare you to do so !\" said Mrs. Broom. \" Then I will for you,\" said Heron. He released Mrs. Broom's hands as ho spoke, and snatched the letter that her husband had taken from her pocket, from his hesitating grasp. Heron opened it, and read it aloud : \u2014 \" Most ciiAE.irxG Amelia, \u2014 \" Get rid of the wretch you call your husband to-morrow night, and 1 will come to sup with you. A lobster will arrive at ten o'clock, and you, charming Amelia, will find the trimmihgs. \" This is from yoeir oev^, \"ADOLPnrs Wiggins.\" Mr. Broom, with a deep groan, sunk to tho bottom of the coach. Heron laughed. \"Now, sir,\" he said, \"I leave you to your own .eflections ; and if, as the charming Amelia says, you are half a third of a man, you will have some thing to say to Mr. Wiggins and the finest woman in Paddington.\" Heron turned his horse's head, and at the mo ment he did so, a loud, harsh voice cried out, \" And I shall have soeeiething to say to the Baron Von Peck, who should be on his rojid to Ham burgh, but who is on the highway, stopping his Majesty's lieges in the broad, open face of day.\" Heron looked in the direction of the sounds, and beheld Jonathan Wild mounted on the grey horso with which he had trotted on towards London, and on whioh he had unaccountably turned and come back again to the Gravesend road. Heron was astonished. She screamed and shrieked with rage, and drummed on the bottom of the coach with her feet with frantic violence. The unhappy wretch with the whiskers was thoroughly alarmed. \" Oh, dear \u2014 oh, dear ! If you please, Mr. Highwayman,\" he said, \"let her do what she likes ! I don't want anybody to interfere ! She's the best and most amiable of persons, and the finest woman in all Paddington !\" Heron began to regret that he had interferred with these people at aU, but it was a principle with him always to carry oht an adventure when he began it. \"Well, madam,\" he said ; \"since it appears you keep the purse, it is from you I must get it!\" \" Never, wretch, never ! \u2014 and I shaU only live in hopes of seeing you hanged.\" \" I live in hopes of disappointing you. Now, sir, what is your ntime?\" \" Broom \u2014 my name is Broom \u2014 it's alyaays Broom \u2014 and was my father's before me !\" \" And is this your wile ?\" \" Certainly ; and she's the finest woman in all Paddington !\" \" SUence !\" cried Amelia. \" I thought I had told you over and over again, and that at last, idiot though you are, you fully understood you were not to presume to call me your wife ! You are my husband, if you please \u2014 that is, my pro i terty ; and surely a lady may do what she likes with her own !\" \" WeU, my dear,\" said Mr. Broom, humbly ; \u25a0'I don't mean to contradict you!\" \" You'd better not !\" \" I know it \u2014 I know it ! and I never do !'' \" Well, madam,\" said Heron ; \" where is this purse ?\" \" In my pocket \u2014 and where you won't get it.\" Heron leant forward upon Daisy, lotting the bridle hang upon her neck, so that both his hands were at liberty, and catching the right wrist of Mrs. Broom as well as the left, he held her securely, as he said, \" Now, Mr. Broom, you will take the purse from her pocket, and this coarse, detestable woman cannot help herself !\" \" Coarse ?\" shrieked Mrs. Broom. \" Exactly so !\" \"Detestable?\" A grim smile of satisfaction eat upon tho face of Wild. \" More so than tongue can tell !\" \"I daren't do it! \u2014 I daren't do it!\" said Mr. Broom. \" If you don't,\" said Heron, \" I shall have no resource but to hand her over to some of my men, whs) are closf-^t hand, who will make short work of her!\" \"So, Baron,\" he added, \"we meet at last, face to face, and I catch you in the very fact of high way robbery !\" \" Indeed !\" said Heron. \" Yes, indeed !

Even as he went, and riding fast as he was, Heron begun to loosen the dress of the Baron Von Peclc, which he woro over the naval costume of Captain Fantome. \" It appears to me,\" said Heron, \" that you are premature.\" \"Ah! As how?\" \" You have not cautrht me yet!\" \" I have ! Yield, or yoiire a dead man !\" Jonathan Wild puUed both his holster-pisto! . out from the saddle, and presented them full at Felix Heron. The shadowy lane was reached. \" Tom, Tom !\" shouted Heron, \" are you there ?\" \" Blaze away!\" said Heron. \" Here, Captain \u2014 here ! Is all well ?\" \" Quite so. But this has been an adventure WUd was surprised. \" By heaven and earth !\" he said, \" you'ro a brave feUow ; and, wero it not for one thing, I should feel inclined to make terms with you for a sessions or two, and let you have your swing out on the road, before you took your final swing out on Tyburn Tree.\" * \" To what consideration,\" said Heron, quietly, \" am I indebted for your rankest animosity ?\" \"You aspire to the hand of the widowed Countess of Whitcombe !\" more eventful than I expected.\" \" What has happened, Captain ?\" \" I have had an encounter with Jonathan Wild.\" Tom Ripon's eyes opened amazingly widn, and he looked auxiouslyin the face of Captain Heron, as though he would ascertain by so doing, with out further questioning words, what had been the result of that encounter. Heron knew perfectly well that that was Tom wanted to know, so ho added, hastily, \" I liavo left Wild and his horse both sprawling in the roadway, Tom.\" \"Hurrah!\" shouted Tom. \" There's an end of him !\" \" Oh, is that it ?\" \" That is it !\" \" Then, Jonathan Wild, you are mistaken , for the Countess of AVhitcombe has already accepted a proposal of marriage from a certain Captain Fautome, an officer in the royal navy, to whom she wiU be married, probably, to-morrow !\" \" I don't believe a word of it !\" \"Do not make too sure of that. The. fellow has more lives than a cat, and that they say has nine ; and of late I am very much inclined to be of old Lady Castleneau's opinion, which is that AVild, being born to be hanged, no other fate can possibly overtake him.\" By this time FeUx Heron had succeeded in di vesting himseU entirely of the over-clothing which represented the Baron Von Peck, and in restoring himself to the outward appearance of Captain Fantome, of the royal navy. \" What's to be tho next move, Captain ?\" asked Tom. \" As you please !\" \" I give you half a, minute to yield yourself a prisoner ! Let that time elapse, and I fire !\" \" Shoot him \u2014 shoot him I\" screamed Mrs. Broom, from the post-chaise. \"KiU him \u2014 kill him, at once ! I hate the wretch !\" This unexpected cry saved, probably, Felix Heron's life, for Jonathan Wild, not expecting it, involuntarily turned his eyes in the direction from whence it came. Captain Heron was watching him with tho keenness of a man who felt that his life depended upon the issues of the next few minutes. Ho could not but feel that the time had come which had been sUghtly hinted at by Tom Ripon, when aU other considerations would have to bo forgotten, and where that self-preservation which is indeed the first law of nature would como into operation, as between him and Jonathan AVild. The moment therefore, that ho saw Wild's eyes distracted from the steady contemplation of him, Heron drew forth one of his own pistols and fired. AVUd's hat flew off his head. \" To town with what speed we may ; and if Jonathan AVUd is not seriously .injured, I feel quite confident that we shall yet hear something of him before reaching London.\" Felix Heron drove out of the lane with Daisy again in harness, and all the arrangements as complete as they had been in the first instance, when he started from the Uttle hotel at Gravesend, in his new disguise. The road seemed perfectly clear, and although Heron looked back for a considerable distance, so as to command a view of the spot of his en counter with Mr. and Mrs. Broom, tho post-chaise which had conveyed that singular couple was not to seen. Believing himself shot, Jonathan at once dis charged both Ms own pistols, but in the hurry of the moment his aim was lost, aud tho pair of slugs with which each of them was loaded flew harm lessly past FeUx Heron. Jonathan. Wild too had disappeared along with his horse. \"Well, Tom,\" said Heron, \"there is just a possibility now that we may get to London with c\u00bbut further interruption.\" \" Unless we interrupt somebody ourselves,\" said Tom. \" Forward, Daisy !\" cried Heron. Then Daisy took one of those terrific leaps she was accustomed to, and so unrivalled at. The leap brought her and her rider full against Jonathan AVild aud his horse, and Heron reversing the pistol in his hand so that he held it by tho barrel, dealt AVild on the instant of the encounter such a blow with the butt end of it on the heaa, that horso and man went down together, rolling amid the challcy elust of tho road. It was not part of Heron's plau to linger for a moment after this victory. \" True, true ; but it is tbe Court, the King, and their adviser, who have driven me to this course ; but after to-day, I mean to make up my mind to ono proceeding, and ono proceeding only.\" '\u2022 What may that bo, Captain ? Not to go off the r.-siel, I hope ?\" \" No ; but I intend to bo tho special scourge and terror of all persons connected with the"], [154, "EDITH HERON. 148 agone down the road ! You're as bad a3 our black bull as tossed Mrs. Crumpet !\" \" Bah ! Stop your fool's tongue !\" said AVild. \" There is some mystery here which I shall find out sooner or later.\" Court. My sphere of action henceforth shall lio between London and Windsor, London and Kew, and the AVhite Lodge in Richmond Park. Those shall be the places which I will render at once dangerous and famous. And since the Court and its minions deprive me of tho legitimate pro perty which should keep me as a gentleman and a nobleman, I wiU make them pay the penalty, and with interest to boot.\" \" In the meantime,\" said Felix Heron, \" I look upon you as the most impertinent rascal I have met with for a long time !\" \" My service to you,\" laughed Wild ; \" that's just what I am ! I Uve, cat, drink, and sleep by my impertinence ; and I've an impression upon my mind that you and I some day wUl be better acquainted !\" \" We may be,\" said Heron ; \" but I don't like crowds, and seldom attend executions.\" Wild made a gesture of impatience, and shook the bridle of his horse. \"Yes, Captain,\" cried Tom Bipon, \"that's the plan. It will be fine sport ; and if we should happen to get a Uttle more than we want, why, you know, we can be charitable ; and that will be making those selfish rascals who only look to themselves, distribute some of their money among ui. poor, whether they Uke it or not.\" \" Hush, Torn! \u2014 do you hear nothing?\" Captain neron, as he spoke, slackened the speed of the two horses, so that the sound of their hoofs upon the ground, and the grinding of the chaise wheels, were not sufficiently loud to obliterate any other sound. He seemed in the act of riding off, when a sudden thought made him pause ; and turning abruptly, he said, \" Your name is Fantome\u2014Cap tain Fantome, of the royal navy ?\" \" WeU, what then ?\" \" By all that's infernal, I thought as much ! And what that rascal Von Peck said is true ! You're going to London, and your destination is Whitcombe House, in St. James's Street ?\" Au approaching horse at a fast trot was heard. In two or three minutes more Jonathan Wild himself- rode up to the side of the chaise. He presented a grotesque and wretched ap- \" Peter !\" said Felix Heron. poarance. His hat was far back upon his head, for he had taken off his cravat, and wound it twice over his brow, so that his hat was not large enough to cover it. \"Yees, maister.\" \" This fellow grows more impertinent every moment. I shaU certainly complain of him to his superiors, and get him discharged. I only wish I had him on the main-deck of my ship, I should know then what to do with him.\" His fall, too, upon the chalky and dusty road had disordered and begrimed his apparel. But otherwise, with his usual good luck, WUd did not seem to have sustained any par ticular injury. \"Yees, maister; and if our black buU had he on a common, he'd know what to do with him !\" Without then making any further reply to Jonathan Wild, Heron drove on. It was a strange thing to see Felix Heron and Tom Ripon driving to London, with Jonathan Wild following a few paces in the rear, totally unconscious that they were the two persons, of all Uving beings, in whom he felt the greatest interest. He glanced savagely into the chaise, as he cried out, \" AVeU, sir, as an officer in his Majesty's service, I cannot help thinking you might have lent some little assistance to me in the perform ance of my duty.\" \" What's your duty to me ?\" said Heron. \" I know nothing about you or your duty either. Strike my topsails, man ! whatever do you mean ? \" But so it was; and his conviction of the death of Heron was so strong, nothing having at all oc curred to shake it that, had he seen him actuaUy in his ordinary costume, and totally undisguised, he must have taken him for a spirit. The remainder of the distance to London was soon achieved ; and, as Wild seemed thoroughly resolved to follow them, to make certain of their destination, Heron found that there was no re source but to put a bold face upon the matter, and drive at once to AVhitcombe House. \" You must have heard a disturbance on the road ; and, in fact, now I come to think of it, I can't make out how you're here in advance of me, when I never met you as I rode back again. That's suspicious.\" CHAPTER CCXXVII. This seemed all that AVild wanted to see, for he drew up at the corner of Pall Mall ; and then, uttering an exclamation or two, he rode off to tho City. The only remarkablo thing as regarded Jonathan AVild in the whole of this transaction THE PERILOUS POSITION OF FELIX HERON. THE FAMILY COUNCIL AT WHITCOMBE HOUSE. The keen, hawk-like glance that Jonathan Wild beut upon Felix Heron and Tom Ripon, impressed them both with a sense of danger. They could not help fooling that if their dis guises stood the test of that critical and practised examination, they might rely upon them in any emergency. was that he had failed to detect Daisy as one of the horses in the chaise. That was the weak point of the whole arrange ment ; and if Jonathan Wild had seen it it must have awakened a thousand strange thoughts aud suspicions in his mind, which would have been full of danger and turmoil to Heron and Tom Bipon. \"It's very strange,\" said Wild, half-communing with himself and half addressing Heron, \u2014 \" it's very strange, but I can't help thinking I'vo seen both of you before !\" \" In course you have, stupid !\" said Tom ; \"and it bean't strange at all ! AAHiy, you met us awhile But happily that danger was avoided. The chaiso was taken by Tom to tho inn,"], [155, "149 EDITH HERON. where it was to be left, and the two horses were snugly ensconced in the stable of AVhitcombe House. Bridgewater; \"and I may mention here, without the risk of it being earned further, or even whis pered into adveree ears, that the King is ailing. and that his physicians do not give him a year of Use!\" It was late in the afternoon, then, that a small party was assembled in the well-known green drawing-room of AVhitcombe House to debate and decido upon certain important matters con nected with the welfare of Edith and of FeUx Heron. \"Indeed!\" was the general exclamation. \" Yes ; and I have it upon good authority that Lord Bute, the Duke of Portland, and some others of the Privy Council, have had long and secret interviews with the illustrious personage who will be his successor on the throne of England.\" \" The demise of the King,\" said Colonel Tre lawney, \"would change the whole aspect of af fairs, and his successor could not commence a reign with the persecution of any of the old no bUity. Moreover, it is well known that he has a special dislike to one of your great enemies, Whit combe \u2014 if not the greatest \u2014 at the Court.\" \" You allude to Lord Clackington ?\" \" I do.\" The party consisted only \"of those few persons who were aware of the existence of Felix Heron, and of aU the circumstances connected with his position. The young Earl of Bridgewater and Lady Bridgewater. Colonel Trelawney, and his sister. And last, though not least, in everybody's estimation, the old Lady Castleneau. The young and gallant Marquis of Ormond, too, was expected. The party, therefore, was a strong one in rank, intelligence, and beauty. FeUx Heron spoke in those low, gentle accents, whicli, in the privacy of his own house, be was wont to assume ; or rather, we may say, they were natural to him, and only exchanged for different accents and tones, os the circumstances and col- Usions of the great world around him enforced particular lines of action. \" The prejudice against me, it appears,\" he Baid, \" is stUl so strong in the mind of the King and of his principal counsellors, that, uutU some change takes place \u2014 which can scarce be at present hoped for \u2014 it is aB well that I should still be supposed among the dead than among tho living.\" \" Yes,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater. \" I have tried in vain aU the influence I could bring to bear among those Privy Councillors whom I thought the most reasonable, and I find there was a fixed determination to adopt a proceeeUng, in regard to the Earldom of Whitcombe, of the most calamitous character!\" \" He is thoroughly* contemptible.\" \" Truly so, personally ; but having the ear of the King, is Uke some dangerous serpent on such vantage ground that he can sting his enemies without fear of retaUation.\" \" Unless one chooses to put one's heel upon his head,\" said Heron, \" and crush him.\" \" I have had serious thoughts,\" said Colonel Trelawney, \"of calling him out, and giving him six inches of cold steel in Bloomsbury Fields.\" \" You would lose your commission to a cer tainty,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater. \" I advise that you let him alone.\" \"Well, gentlemen,\" said Lady Castleneau, \"this is all very interesting, but I want to hear what FeUx has to say about a domestic proposition that I, for one, should be glad to see carried out.\" \"Thanks, dear Lady Castleneau !\" said Heron. \" I wiU come to the proposition at once, and it ia simply this. This house wants a master \u2014 and Edith \" Edith smiled as she said, \"You would say, Felix, that I want one likewise !\" \" More peril and more grief !\" exclaimed Edith. \" It is proper,\" added the Earl of Bridgewater, \" that I should inform you there was some scruple about bringing scandal to the peerage, by ac cusing Felix Heron of high way robbery; but it was intended to construe some of his acts into high treason, so as to establish an attainder against tho title.\" A flash of anger cam e across the face of Heron. \" No, Edith, you want a protector ; and am I I not one ever ?\" \" You are indeed, my Felix !\" \" Yes ; but it is in secret ! You and our little one want such a protector as can stand by you in the open face of day, and shield you with a strong hand from aU peril. The proposition, then, which I make, and which I hope wiU meet with the concurrence of all herj present, is tliat Edith shaU marry Captain Fantome, of the royal navy, represented by me ; and then I shall be able to show myself here at Whitcombe House as its master, and defy aU comers !\" \" I see \u2014 I understand,\" he said ; \" my innocent child would have been made to suffer for the pre judices against his father !\" \" Yes,\" added the Earl of Bridgewater ; \" and the attainder, once established, the estates of- tho earldom would, as you all know, have been for feited to the Crown ; and they would have con stituted now a nice little bit of plunder, to divide among some of tho poverty-stricken miuions of the Court !'\" \" But how,\" said Lady Castleneau, \" would that effect Edith's position, when all these things come to be known, and FeUx Heron is declared to be stUl in life ?\" \" I don't think,\" said Colonel Trelawney, \" that any bad effect can ensue. The thing wUl only noed to be explained, and there wUl bo an end us it.\" \"Well, it is then,\" said Heron, \"that I should be considered with the dead !\" \" And I think the proposition a good one,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater. \" It shaU be- decided by the votes of the ladies,\" added Heron. \"And I would ask \u2014 is it not better that I should be here openly as Edith's husband and the master of this house, than here secretly, subject to all manner of suspicion, andlifewise \" It is well,\" said Colonel Trelawney, \" for it saves both the estates and the title ; but this is a Btate of things which we hope will not endure for ever.

It was repugnant to her, but yet it was a com promise, sinco it reaUy stopped her pretended marriage with Captain Fantome of all real egality. \" I consent!\" she said. incurring the possibiUty of casting a slur upon her fair name.\" \" I vote for the marriage !\" eaid Colonel Tre lawney's sister. \" And I !\" said the Countes3 of Bridgewater. \"And I!\" said Lady Castleneau, \"upon one condition.\" \" What condition, dear aunt ?\" asked Edith. \" Simply this, my dear. This marriage is a land of mockery to deceive the world. You are, ir\" I may be aUowed the expression, a mock bride, aud FeUx Heron a mock bridegroom. It wUl be to my mind, therefore, a kind of desecration of so solemn a service of the Church to aUow a marriage to be celebrated under such circumstances.\" \" Then this conference is over,\" remarked Felix Heron. \" It is,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater, \" and I charge myself with the duty of carrying out this plan, feeling a conviction that it is the only mode of securing the estates of AVhitcombe from confis cation and the title from attainder.\" \" What would you do, aunt ?\" asked Heron. \" It must be an apparent marriage, but not a real one. Let the necessary license be got and the marriage performed, or said to be performed, at my house, but not by a clergyman ; so that, as the thing is unreal in the beginning, it shall be unreal to the end.\" This being all arranged, it was a great reUef to Edith to feel that in tho disguise he \u25a0 so weU as sumed, FeUx Heron would be able to take his proper place as master of AVhitcombe House. Tho secret was one to be well kept, inasmuch as the only persons who would know it wero those then and there present at the conference, together with those faithful dependants of FeUx Heron who made up the household of Whitconibo House. \" In that case,\" said Edith, \" there need be no ceremony at all ; and, if we can persuade the world that there has been one, it wiU be suffi cient.\" \" Now hear me,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater. \" I cannot see the danger and the difficulty iu this matter, and I advise that the union be public. Nothing can come of it in the end in the shape of disaster; and you may depend upon one thing, which is, that there are too many eyes bent upon AVhitcombe House, and upon the proceedings of the Countess, to make any other course a safe one.\" The Earl of Bridgewater was impetuous and quick in aU his transactions, and on the very next day he set about procuring the necesssary license for the marriage of the mock Captain Fantome with the real Countess of Whitcombe. Felix Heron communicated what was about to occur to Tom Bipon and to Ogle. The former he cautioned most particularly not to communicate in any shape or way to his mother or to the Rev. Mortification the secret of the real identity of Captain Fantome. This strong opinion on the part of the Earl of Bridgewater had aU its effect upon the persons present. \" You'U have a rest, Tom,\" he said, \" and so wiU Daisy, for during the next fortnight I shall not seek adventures on the road ; and when I elo it will be in a new character, which probably will somewhat surprise the agents of the police.\" It was with a secret satisfaction that Tom heard these words. AU eyes were bent upon Edith ; for, after aU, it was upon her decision that the whole matter rested. \" Let this mock union, then, be public,\" she said ; \" but let that pubUcity not outrage an ordi nance of the Church \u2014 for that is a thing I can never consent to.\" He had plans of his own. The temptation to try bis fortune on the road, unaccompanied by Felix Heron, was too great for him, and since his last disappointment in love affairs, a feeling of misanthropy had come over him. \" But, Edith !\" said Heron, in a tone of re monstrance. \" Nay, Felix,\" interrupted Edith, imploringly, \" do not urge me to this. The more I look at it, the more repugnant it is to my feelings. I have once stood at the altar with you as your wUc, and I cannot bear to repeat thoso vows again, even in mockery, to another.\" \" But it is not to another, Countess !\" said the Earl of Bridgewater. For tho next few clays Tom cogitated deeply with himseU. The result was that he came to a determination, tho particulars of which we shall proceed to lay before our readers. \" I know it is not, and I feel that I have ex pressed myself badly. Dear Aunt Castleneau, you know what I mean. Can you not suggest somo mode of relief from this eUfficulty ?\" \" I think I can, my child. Everything in this world is a compromise, and why may not this take the same conditions ? \" CHAPTER CCXXVIII. TOM MAKES A HALF CONFIDENCE WWII OGLE.\u2014 HE GOES ON THE ROAD. \"How, Lady Castleneau?\" asked Bridgo watei-. \" Ogle,\" said Tom, as they both stood in tho stable admiring Daisy, \" what do you think of Bright Eyes?\" \"Of who?\" \" Just this way. Let a special liceuso bo pro cured for the marriago of Captain Fantome, of the royal navy, with Edith, Countess of AVhitcombe.

I thought you gave her up, and placed all your affections on that young lady who went by tho name of the King's Ward.\" \" So I did,\" said Tom; \"but she had the bad taste to prefer that thin, lanky young fellow, tho Marquis of Ormond ; so, you see, Ogle, I let him have her !\" \" Very good, Ogle ; so that when I'm missed you wUl know what has become of me ?\" \" Oh, certainly ! Is that all you have to say ?\" Tom was sUent for a few seconds, and then he replied, \" Yes, I think that is aU I feel inclined to say.\" \"Very weU ; I seek for nobody's secrets. I can see you have one beyond what you've told me ; and I only hope you're not going to get into any mischief you wiU find it difficult to ex tricate yourself from.\" \" Oh, no ! Trust me for that.\" \" How much obliged he must have been, Tom ! Woa, Daisy !\u2014 woa! Don't stamp upon my foot, lass.\" \"Very well, then ; please'yourself.\" Ogle stroUed out of the stable, and left Tom in companionship with Daisy. Tom sighed, as he flung bis arm rouud Daisy's neck. \" Then, don't you puU her ears. Ogle, for she don't like it.\" \" Very good. But what is it you want to do or say, Tom ?\" \"Why, just this, Ogle. I want you to do what I know you can do quite well, and that is to keep a great secret.\" Ogle looked rather grave. \" I can't say I Uke secrets, Tom ; and till I know what this on-j exactly is, I should not Uke to promise to keep it.\" \" It won't hurt you. Look you here, Ogle ; the Captain is not going on the road for some time, since I ratner fancy he has an adventure on hand that he koeps aU to himscU.\" \" AVhat is tliat ?\" \" I should have Ukcd to have told him, Daisy,\" he said, \" that I meant to take you with me ; but I was afraid, wheu it came to the last moment, that he would say ' No ;' and U I went on saying ' Yes,' he might speak to the Captain himself, and then there would be an order against it, and it would bo all up with my dashing career on the road.\" Tom caressed Daisy as he spoke. \"As it is, you know, Daisy, the Captain ex pressly ordered me to take you out for exercise, and he did not say a word whether the exercise was to be in the night or the day, nor does that matter much to you, Daisy. Eh ? Does it ?\" Daisy was very fond of Tom, and rubbed her head affectionately upon his shoulder. \" Why, you know, Ogle, I told you all about that ghost w o saw in the lane leading to Holland House over by Kensington.\" \" You d'.d, Tom \u2014 but it turned out to be no ghost at ail.\" \" That's right !\" added Tom. \" That means that you don't care a bit. So we will take our selves off this very night, and see what we can do ; and who knows but Tom Ripon may yet make a name on the road that may be almost equal to that of Captain Heron ?\" With all the secrecy and despatch in his power, Tom, at about eight o'clock on that evening, when it had become thoroughly dark, made his way to Daisy's stable. SUently and swiftly he saddled and bridled tho docile and beautiful creature ; and then, carefully examining his pistols, or, rather, Captain Heron's pistols, which were kept in the holsters of tho saddle, he took Daisy by the bridle, and led her to the door of the stable. \" I'm not quite so sure of that!\" \"AVhy, the Captain fired at it !\" \" Y\u00bbJ ; and you know as well as I do, Ogle, that lid wouldn't mind firing at anything that was in hia way, ghost or no ghost ! But that's not the question. I know he found out something iD HoUand House that has set him to work ever since. I asked him to let me have a hand in it, but ho said it wasn't the sort of thing for a man Uke me.\" Ogle shook his head again. \" AVhat do you mean, Ogle, by all those antics ? You keep on shaking your head, as U you did not beUeve a fellow !\" \" Are you quite sure, Tom, the Captain said a man Uke you ?\" \"How particular you are! Perhaps he did, aud perhaps he didn't ! But that's not the ques tion either.\" \"There's a good deal yet to de,\" he said, \" before I can please myself, aud go on the road as I ought to go ; but I think the old gal ought to mauage aU that, so I'll just trot down to Wardour Street first, and see what she's got in that mouldy old crib that she and Mortification Uve in.\" \" Good gracious, Tom, then what is the ques tion ? AVhat do you want to do, and what do you want me to do ?\" \" Only to keep my secret, that's all! I want to try my own fortune on the\" road, and that alone, too ! But I don't seem to like the idea of going without anybody having an idea of what I'm about ! I might want some help, or I might want to send some message home here, and I shouldn't Uke, then, that there wasn't a soul in AVhitcombe House who k\u00bbew anything about me.\" There was no difficulty in leaving the stables of AVhitcombe House without observation. -, AVe had have before occasion to remark that those stables were very extensive, and went far back to a cpiiet, dud street, into which opened some capacious gates. Under orcUnary circumstances it would havo been necessary to open one of those gates to take out a horse. But Daisy was as docUe as a cat or a dog; and when Tom Ripon opened the smaU wicket, which was intended only for human ingress and egress, Daisy stooped low down, and foUowed him out through it with the greatest ease aud dexterity. \"That's right, Daisy,\" cried Tom; \"now we \"Very weU, Tom, I cau'thelp it!

A feeling of great exultation and triumph came over Tom as he now felt himself fairly in the open street, weU armed and accompanied by Daisy. \" Yea, then, as the Psalmist says, and says most wisely, 'he who bringcth nothing, commonly cometh on an errand to take something away.' \" He muttered to himself as he went the self deception by which he strove to persuade himseU ( 'aptain Heron could not visit him with much blame. \"Just so, old Corruption.\" \" Old what ?\" \" Oh, it's the same thing, Mortification, you. know.\" \" Thou art irreverent, Thomas ; and as the Psalmist remarks, brimstone will be thy daily food.\" \" The Captain told me to take Daisy out for exercise, and here we are ; so that's all right, ain't it, Daisy?\" Daisy knew very well when Tom addressed her, and gave him a sort of friendly push with her head when he did so, which Tom was always ready to translate into yes or no as the occasion suited. \" Look here, old Mortification,\" said Tom, whose patience was almost exhausted, \" I have something to say to the old gal, and I mean to come in and say it. Now, are you going to open the- door or not ? \" '\" Yea, I decline !\" \"You do?\" Indeed, Tom put so many words into Daisy's mouth, that to hear him speak to her, one would imagine that, in addition to all her other qualities and rare instincts, she was actuaUy endowed with the power of speech. \"Yea, she whom you call the old gal is in a state of repose, for rum punch is an inviting liquor.\" aI don't believe it,\" said Tom. \"So if you won't open the door, I will.\" Tom did not venture to pass the front of Whit combe House, but he led Daisy by several circuit ous back streets, towards sharing Cross. Close, then, to the old dilapidated pile of buildings known as the King's Mews, he mounted. \"Ha, ha, Thomas! Ha, ha! Thou mayest try!\" \" I mean to ! \" It was but a short trot then to Wardour Street, Soho, where his mother and Mortification conducted that fence which, no doubt, was a sufficiently profitable undertaking. The Reverend Mortification no doubt under rated Tom's ability to effect an entrance into tho fence, and the means by which Tom intended to carry out that intention never for a moment entered into his imagination. The little colloquy that had taken place be tween them had been carried on by Mortification through a small orifice at the top of the door, from whence either he or Mrs. Ripon were in the habit of reconnoitring their customers, and de ciding whether, in the thieves' language of London, the person applying was a \" plant,\" that is to say, a spy, or really a \" family man,\" with something to dispose of as the produce of a robbery. As usual, at sunset, the shop, which ostensibly was one for the sale of second-hand wearing apparel, was closed. Mrs. Ripon's customers preferred darkness. They had no particular predilection either for being looked at through the shop windows. The business of the establishment then fairly commenced only after nightfall. Indeed, it is very doubtful if any one ever crossed the threshold except the Reverend Morti fication himself during daylight. Tom rapped at the shutters with the butt of one of Captain Heron's pistols without dismount ing from Daisy. \" Yea,\" said a voice, \" who knooketh?\" \" Is the old gal at home ?\" \" Yea, it is Thomas. As the Psalmist remarks, talk of the , and he's sure to appear. Your respected maternal relative, Thomas, was con versing of misdeeds ; and yoa, we wero both wondering if thou wert hanged or not.\" \" Thank you,\" said Tom \u2014 \"much obliged; but that little affair has not come off yot.\" \" Yea, I rejoice.\" \" Well, don't stand palavering there, but open the door.\" The Reverend Mortification thought himself secure as in a fortress. But Tom was of a different opinion. Tho street was qnite deserted, and the only watchman at the corner of it was taking his first nap, snugly ensconced in his box. Tom, therefore, was in a condition to carry on the siege of the fence, and to take it by assault, which he fully intended to do, without much feaV of interruption. Once more Tom asked Mortification if he in tended to admit him, or whether he preferred leaving him to effect an ontrance, to which Morti fication replied. \"Yea, Thomas, verily thy mother is dozing Sweetly in an easy chair by the fire, aud I will not disturb her slumbers for so unprofitable a sinner as thou art\" \" Very well,\" said Tom ; \" here goes !\" To the surprise of Mortification, Tom wheeled Daisy round in such a manner that Mortification thought ho was about to take his departure \u2014 but uo such thing entered Tom's head for givWg \" Thomas \u2014 yea, Thomas \" \" AVeU, what now, old boy ?\" \" Is it business or pleasure ?\" \" I don't know what you mean.\" \" Yea, dost thou come to bring spoons, or per chance forks, or mayhap a silver dish-cover ? \u2014 for those things vorily are business. But if thou oomest"], [159, "153 EDITH HERON. Daisy a peculiar touch, he made her throw out her hind legs, when crash) crash went the door of tho fence, and Tom had the inexpressible amusement of seeing Mortification spe-awling his length on the floor of the fence. \"Hilloa, old boy! hope you're not hurt much,\" he said, as he dismounted from Daisy, and gave the stool upon wliich Mortification had been standing a lack with his foot, which again upset his father-in-law. Mrs. Ripon could not but be conscious of some disturbance in the front of the premises. During the first part of the cannonade which Daisy's heels had made against the door of the fence, she had only responded to the tumult by a series of sympathetic starts. But upon the door actually giving way, and the Beverend Mollification coming to giief with the shock, Mrs. Ripon was fully aroused. No. 72. -Edith. She started up with a she-ill scream. \" That's the old gal !\" said Tom. \" Thieves ! \u2014 thieves !\" \"All's right!\" said Tom. \"Here wo both are.\" \" Murder !\" cried Mortification. \" Yea, Thomas, it is thy duty to assist thy paternal relative-iu law. This stool hath three legs and I have two, and yea we have become entangled together, so that I know not which are mine and which are the stool's.\" \" Come on Daisy,\" said Tom. \" Don't tread on the old boy.\" Daisy, with great care, stepped over Mortifica tion and the stool ; and then Tom backed her into a snug corner of the shop, and, patting her on the neck, he said, \" Just wait there a bit, my lass, and I'll soon come back to you.\" Tom, then, at once made his way into the par-"], [160, "154 EIHTII HERON. a Uttle too wide ; but those are good faults, Tom, as I dare say you're growing still.\" \" Plague take it !\" said Tom. \" Am I to wear old Buster's things tUl I've grown big enough ior them ?

I wan^ to know U, among all your old traps in the shop, you can fit me out as a real, right down, genuine, high-flying highwayman ?\" \" Captain Buster !\" screamed Mrs. Bipon. The exclamation was so sudden, and so StBB pletc-ly unexpected by Tom, that he fully believed an individual of that name had really made his appearance.' \" No nonsense !\" shouted T\u00b0W- \" \u00a3eep off, old Buster, whoever you are.\" \"It isn't that,\" added Mrs. Ripon. \" But you said Buster.\" \" | mean his clothes. He came here and sold himself, for one pound twelve and six ; and it's a sweet suit, aU gold lace and gimeracks, and just the thing for you, Tom.\" \"\"Yea,\" said the Rev. Mortification, \"he shall have it for three-ten and six : it's a bargain, for it was the last suit of Buster, and yea, he hath not another.\" Tom Bipon looked smart and handsome in the costume of the Captain, who, from dire necessity, had been compelled to part with his regimentals to Mrs. Bipon. The costume was not strictly a military one. That is to say, it did not belong to tho regular service, but was the sort of fancy dress adopted by some country yeomanry. It answered Tom Eipon's purpose, however, admirably \u2014 for the coat was (sf scarlet, and richly bedizened with gold lace. Tfae smallclothes were of buff leather, and there were boots of black morocco, which reached Up to the knee. To be sure, the whole of this dress was a little too large for Tom, as his mother had predicted ; put somehow or another, he cUd not look very bad in it; and the probabiUty was that, on poise back, no one would be able to notice that it did not fit him quite so accurately as it might do. \" Old gal!\" cried Tom, \"you may come out of the chimney \u2014 aU's right ! \" \" Gracious powers ! \" cried Mrs. Bipon ; \" he looks like the celebrated Richard Turpin, Bsdpiire, or that very gentlemanly young man, Clauelo Duval.\" \"Yea,\" said Mortification, \"and, he will come to the same end, if he miude'th what he's about.\" Tom put himseU in an attitude, and began to sing- 's Hurrah for the road, and a starlight night, A nag so fresh aud free ; Hurrah for a life on the open heath, 11 Yea,\" said Tom, \" and what did he do after he had sold it, then ?\" \" Tom,\" said Mrs. Ripon, \" you're getting im proper. He went home in a watchman's great coat, of course. But you shall see the suit. Get it at once, Bumblebee.\" A life on the road for me ! \" \" That's divine ! \" said Mrs. Bipon. \" The dear boy takes after me. If I had not been a deUcate aud sensitive female I should have gono on the road my seU : but whatever becomes of you, Tom, never forget your mother.

And now, old gal, I want something else.\" \" We never pay beforehand,\" said Mrs. Ripon. \" It's a great accommodation to lot you have \" Hilloa !\" cried Tom. \" Keep off, Bumblebee. Who the deuce are you ?\" \" Yea,\" said Mortification, \" it is a little affec tionate name which your respected and sainted mother hath invented for me.

So look aUve, old Bumble, and get the Captain's clothes.\" \" Yea, I will.\" \" Waa he a good-looking chap, old gal, like me, eh ?

Captain Buster's smart things ; but as for any , '\u25a0* Yea, it is out of the question !\" said Morti fication. \" AVho told you it was out of the question ?\" replied Mrs. Bipon, with the most charming in consistency. \" Yea, I \" The sense of exultation in Tom's mind was very great. Here he was, fairly launched upon the world upon his own responsibility. He bestrode one of the best \u2014 if not the best \u2014 horse that was to be found in tho three king doms. \" Hold your tongue, wiU you, and allow the tenderest of mothers to settle with her own infant !\" The Rev. Mortification evidently expected something else at his head, and by way of giving it the least possible chance of hitting him, he kept bobbing down iu the most extraordinary fashion, as if some trap-door were beneath his feet, whioh kept letting him down a foot or two, and then popping him up again to his full height. \" Come, come,\" said Tom, \" don't trouble about me. What I want, old gaL is a riding habit!\" - He was light-hearted and brave. And he was well armed. He knew that he could perfectly depend upon Captain Heron's holster pistols, and he had with him a powder flask well filled, with a separate receptacle containing a dozen bullets. Tom was quite resolved, if it were possible, to render a good account of his night's adventures, and to inaugurate his career as a highwayman by some exploit that should excite the admiration of every one who knew him. What that exploit was to be, Tom of necessity left entirely to the chapter of accidents. And so he trotted on. \" A what ?\" screamed Mrs. Ripon. \" A what ?\" cried Mortification, as ho bobbed down again. \"A riding habit!\" \" Yea. Mrs. Mountweazel !\" He was soon clear of the houses in what was then called the Oxford Road, and the open country beyond Tyburn Gate lay before him. Perhaps, Tom, in common with many knights of the road, who took that route out of town, felt a slight misgiving as to what might be his ulti mate fate, as he passed the celebrated and well known spot where for so many years criminals had expiated their offences with their lives. Tom reined in his horse. \" Confound her !\" cried Tom ; \" don't let her see me. Who and what tho deuce is she ?\" \"Yea, her riding habit, I mean! Sarah Jane Jemima, my love, \u2014 don't you recollect Mrs. Mountweazel's habit'? Yea, Thomas, her habits are immense !\" \" Gracious powers !\" said Mrs. Bipon, \" it's the very thing. I divine everything \u2014 I divine every thing. I saw all this in the grouts of my tea, yesterday, not very clearly, but now I understand what it meant. You want to put on a riding habit over Captain Buster's dress, aud take it off wllen it's convenient ; which fully accounts for that singular piece of coal that popped out of the fin. aud went into your pocket, Mortification, red hot.\" But it was not to look at Tyburn tree, but it was in curiosity to see who it was that, mounted on a tall, strong-looking horse, seemed to have stopped on the precise spot where executions took place. That part of the Oxford Road was not Ughted, for there being no houses, there were no inhabit ants to pay for the necessary tax. But at the turnpike gate, a little in advance, there were two hanging lanterns, and they cast a lurid glare up and down the road. Tom fixed his eyes on the strange horseman, and as he did so, he began to regret that he had not trotted on at a hard gallop, aud minded his own business. \" Yea, and it would not come out. I became a martyr to fire. Yea!\" \" Well, be quick about it,\" said Tom. \" You have guessed it, mother ; and so are as good as a witch, in addition to looking liko one.\" \u2022' You wretched boy, how dare you ? A witch, indeed ! I a witch ? \" \" Never mind \u2014 never mind ! Come, old Bum ble, the riding-habit ; and I teU you what I want beside. A small portmanteau, or round vaUse, that will strap on the saddle at the back of Daisy, and then I'm all right. And U I'm not here be fore daylight witlf plenty of booty, caU me a Dutchman, or a Frenchman, or any other out landish stupid you Uke. Good-bye, old gal ! Good-bye, Mortification ! It did not take a second glance from the keen, youthful eyes of Tom Ripon to recognise in this horseman, Jonathan WUd. WUd's horse Was standing still as a statue. But Jonathan himseU seemed to be muttering something which seemed almost like an invoca tion to the spirits of the many persons who had suffered death on that identical spot. AVild took no notice of Tom Ripon. \" ' Hurrah, hurrah for the road ! He was in such a state of absorbed abstraction that he had not heard the light footsteps of Daisy ; and Tom was able to approach close to the great thief-taker without being observed. Tom Ripon was sharp of hearing, as well as sharp of sight. Something, I hear, approaches _ Hurrah, hurrah for the road I It's a sound that's just like coaches I And that suits me !' \" Tom was very well provided, now, from the misceUaueous stores of the fence in Wardour Street, with all he wanted ; and as he had con sumed au hour there, and nine o'clock had pealed forth from the church-steeples in the metropoUs for some time, he hastUy mounted Daisy, and took his way, .at a smart pace, towards the AVesteru Road. The muttered sentences of WUd came suffi ciently clearly to his ear3 for him to understand them. \" This is the s4th of September,\" said WUd, \" and hero I am ; but I have not suffered ! The prediction is false ; but yet, when I heard it, it"], [162, "156 EDITH HERON. seemed to sink deep into my soul and to be there acknowledged as an incontrovertible truth ! I was to suffer death at Tyburn tree, so ran the prophecy, on the 14th day of September, but the year was not named; and therefore, as this is that date, and it wants now but two hours of mid night, even if my fortune has been read aright, J have another year's lease of life !\" Those tones that were so well known to Jona- than Wild. Too frequently had he had opportunities of hearing them under all circumstances. \"By Jove, it's Tom Ripon!\" he cried. From the fact of ascertaining Tom's identity, Wild easily jumped to another conclusion. \" Yes,\" he added, \" it is Tom Ripon; and there is not another horse in all England could take that leap but Daisy.\" The anxiety of Wild to capture both Tom and the gallant animal he bestrode, became for a few moments intense. Wild laughed hideously as he spoke. Tom Ripon shrunk back, and would gladly have left the thief-taker to his meditations, but as Wild suddenly turned hia horse's head he saw that he was not alone. \" Who are you V\" he cried, fiercely. Tom made no answer. He shouted to the man at the gate to open it in a most frantic manner, and showered down ex pressions of abuse upon his head at a rate that so terrified the gate-keeper that he had hardly senso enough to fling open the bar and allow Jonathan Wild to pass through. \" I say, who are you ? and I tell you, at the same time, that it is not the safest thing in the* world to intrude upon my privacy.\" Tom was bewildered for a moment to know what to do- The delay was not altogether above e minute and a half. But that indecision only lasted for a moment. He then recollected that he was mounted on Then Jonathan was on the other side of the gate. Daisy, who was so matchless in speed that if he chose to start off at a racing gallop, Jonathan Wild would have no chance, on the heavy horee he bestrode, of coming up with him. There was but one objection to this course. The turnpike-gate. At that time of night it was closed. But fortune favoured Tom. But what could not Daisy accomplish when put to her full speed, even in that short space of time? Swift as the wind, she had galloped onward. But the road was an unfortunate one, ap parently, for Tom, since there were no turnings from it of any importance down which he could make his way. A carriage coming from the country to town came rapidly up. The darkness, however, favoured him im mensely. The only lights that glimmered on the roadway after passing Tyburn Gate and the corner of the Edgware Road, were twinkling among tho few houses which then constituted thc little village us Bayswatcr, then composed altogether of abOTit fifty houses. The long, dull, dead wall, now removed, of Kensington Gardens, was to the left, and to the right, long market gardens, but no roadway or even lane down which Tom could make his way. Still, a stern chase, as sailors have it, is a long chase ; and Tom Ripon had not the slightest ap prehension of being overtaken by Jonathan Wild. It was no part, however, of Tom's intention on that night to be hunted far away into the country with the great thief-taker at his heels. And so, as well as the darkness would permit him, he looked anxiously right aud left for some spot where he could come to a halt and allow Wild to pass him. Some large, overhanging trftcs from Kensing ton Gardens so completely overshadowed a por tion of the road at one place, that the appear ance it presented was most black and \u00bb_avcrnous. Tom heard the heavy beat of the horse's hoofs on the road behind him, and ho knew that Wild was making as good progress as he could in pur suit. There was a shout of \" Gate, gate V and it was swung open. But the gate-keeper was wary, and only opened the barrier sufficiently wide for the carriage to pass through. Tom had given Daisy tho impulse to rush forward, hoping to find space enough through which to make his way, but the gate slammed shut exactly in the face of himself and Daisy. \"Halt!\" cried Wild, \u2014 \"halt, I say, or I will send a messenger after you that will bring you to a standstill somewhat unpleasantly.\" Tom Ripon knew perfectly well what the cha racter of this messenger was likely to be. \" A bullet,\" he said to himself. But with all his recklessness Jonathan Wild was not so reckless as that. It was no offence at law for any one to ride on and refuse to stop at the bidding of Jonathan Wild. Tom, however, thought it just possible that, in his usual angry impatience, Wild might commit such an act. The possibility of being brought up at the com mencement of his career by a pistol bullet was not a pleasant one. The gate was closed, but that seemed to be no obstruction, for Daisy, with a perfect conscious ness that Tom Ripon wanted to be on tlio other side of it, made one of her daring leaps, aud cleared it in fine style. He turned thc head of Daisy towards this shadowy portion of the road, and brought her to a standstill, as he bent low in the saddle to escape any blow from tho overhanging branches of the trees. Tom was a light weight, and there was no thing in reason, or even what might appear to be somewhat out of it, that Daisy would not have chared with him on her back. Tom then found that it was at a little iron gate he had paused, which was one of the en trances to the gardens from the Bayswater Road. It was quite accident that made him lay his \" Hurrah!\" shouted Tom. It was an imprudent shout, for in tho exulta tion of the moment, ho uttered it in his natural tones. hand on this gate."], [163, "157 EDITH IIECOX. He was surprised to find it yield to his touch. \" Capital !\" said Tom. \" This is the very rascaUy associates, was quite sufficient to prova that the business they were to bo engaged upon was of a highly criminal and villanous character. thing!\" He dismounted immediately, and pushed the gate open. It was the good-will and pleasure of Felix Heron to do all in his power to foU these men in what they were about. \" Come on, Daisy.\" She foUowed him with all the docility of a dog. \"Now,\" added Tom, \"if Jonathan don't find the gate open as well as I, it's all right, and he'll either go blundering on, or give the affair up as a bad job, and take his way back to town.\" The darkness was so excessive that it was im possible to sec even the outline of the iron gate, but Tom ran his hand down the side of it, in the hope of finding some latch, or temporary means of fastening it. His hand struck against a projection. He held a long debate with himself whether to communicate to Edith or not the particulars of his adventure at Holland House. Of course, the only point which made him pause in making that communication was that her brother, John Tarleton, made a reappearance in the midst of those ' mysterious circumstances, which would be sure to give pain to Edith. The result, however, of the reflections of Heron was that Edith had better know aU. The hour of midnight was the one at which he had to go to the mysterious house near Pall Mall, at which, as he had overheard, four knocks, given with deliberation, would admit him. Tom uttered a sound of gratification. It was a key, which, by some carelessness, had been left in the gate. In another moment Tom had locked himseU It was eleven on that evening when Heron, with the hand of Edith in his own, communicated to her gently and kindly that John Tarleton stUl lived, and that, undeterred by the dangers and the retributions of the past, ho was still en gaged in vUlanous complicatiohs with Lord Warringdale. Edith was deeply affected. \"Felix, FeUx,\" she cried, \"I know the thought is a foolish one, and you will blame me for it; but there is a kind of reflected disgrace upon me in consequence of these actions of one so nearly allied to me.\" into Kensington Gardens, and felt that, for tho time being, he was perfectly secure from Jonathan Wild. Whether he was so in reality or not we shall presently see , but it is necessary that we should leave Tom for awhile, in order to accompany FeUx Heron on that remarkable adventure, the first particulars of which he had ascertained at Holland House from no other lips than those of Lord Warringdale and the reprobate John Tarleton. \" It is a foolish thought, Edith ; for what earthly power, or what earthly logic, can in any manner connect you to a single act or word of Joliu Tarleton ?\" CHAPTER CCXXX. : I feel and know that you are right, Felix ; but still it is a grief.\" fell. heron- confides to edith his plan for i l:_.stkating lord warringdale's and john tarleton's plot. \" Granted that it is so ; there is another reason wh}- you should dismiss from your mind all such thoughts upon this subject\" \" What is that, Felix ?\" Ha\\ ing come to a decision with the concurrence of Edith, and by the advice of thoso friends who wero near and dear to him, that the semblance of a marriage should take place between him and Edith in his assumed name of Captain Fantome, Felix Heron felt his mind more disengaged and at ease than it had been for some time. \"Is not this man who calls himself Warring dale my brother ; and is there anything that John Tarleton can do or conceive that can be worse than we have endured at the hands of Warring dale ?\" He was determined to ferret out and discover, and if possible thwart, the mysterious schemes which Lord Warringdale and John Tarleton Were concocting. \" Alas, alas ! it is so ! But do not court danger, Felix, even for the sake of foUing and confound ing these men ! Let those whom they are about to assail by fraud or by violence find their natural protectors!\" \" I have thought of that, Edith, and what I am about to say in reply to it will sound to you superstitious.\" Whether those sehero.es concerned him or not, he had no exact means of saying. But of ono thing he felt assured.' That was, that there could be nothing but evU in any scheme or plan of operations whatever which was to be carried out by such persons. Fortunately accident had provided him with the means of, at all events, attempting to make some discoveries in regard to the nefarious trans actions which the nobleman who had come to HoUand House was willing to pay so largely for. \" No, Felix, for I know that that is not your nature.\" \" Then I cannot help thinking that Providence threw me in the way of acquiring the knowledge I have of their proceedings, in order that I might foHow up the clue so obtained, and protect those perhaps unable to protect themselves from some terrible complication of disasters.\" \" I cannot combat such a feeling as that.\" \"Nor can I, Edith. It clings to me.\" Heron was specially anxious to discover who this person was who had been so \"inadvertently\" called your grace. The title implied that he belonged to the highest nobility of tho kingdom ; and tho price that he agreed to pay to John Tarleton and his \" Then 1 can only say go, FeUx, and heaven go with you ! It is some satisfaction to me to know that in carrying out this adventure you are close at hand ; and I am sure that for my sake, as"], [164, "158 EDITH IIEHON\". well as for the sake of that other one who is so dear to both of us, you will be careful and mind ful of your safety.\" \" In truth, I will, Edith. The impetuosity which marked my early career has passed away. I feel that I have given hostages to fortune now, and will be as careful of myself as you could wish me.\" That is to say, Lord Warringdale, John Tar leton, and the two ruffianly fellows who had been drinking with the latter at Holland House. Under the circumstances, the arrival of a fifth person would be sure to create the greatest amount of suspicion ; but as one was now, at all events, temporally disposed i of, Heron thought there would be a good chance of his coming at the heart of the mystery without discovery. There was one reflection, however, which gave him some uneasiness. Felix Heron by no means regretted that he had made this confidence with Edith, and he went about the adventure with a lighter heart. Upon consideration, he determined to go in his assumed character of Captain Fantome. He feared that after he had knocked at tho door, some watch-word might be necessary in order to ensure undisputed admittance. But, as in all such adventurous circumstances as the present something must be risked, he did not allow that consideration to stop his progress. One \u2014 two \u2014 three \u2014 four ! He made himself up most carefully. Arming himself with a pair of. pistols, and a short hanger, he wrapped about him a dark brown roquelaire cloak, and putting on a hat destitute of ornament or trimming, he started on his enter prise. He knocked four times clearly and distinctly. The door was immediately opened. \" You are one ?\" said a voice. It wanted ten minutes to twelve o'clock when he left Whitcombe House. The description of the mansion to which he was to make his way, had been quite sufficiently explicit and distinct to afford no chance of missing it. \" I am,\" replied Heron at random. He took care as he spoke to keep his hand upon the butt of a pistol ; but there was no occasion for any such precaution. \" You come from Holland House ?\" added tho voice. Heron passed the gate of old St. James's Palace, and, pacing slowly onward, he soon reached the house with the identical blinds which had been described as that to which John Tarleton was to make his way, to be possessed with the particulars of the special villany he was to be paid so largely for engaging in. Felix Heron could not but feel he ran a risk, even of his life, on the very threshold of this adventure. \" I do.\" \" Come in, and turn to the left when you get to the end of the passage.\" The door was immediately closed behind him, and the passage was in intense darkness. It was rather a nervous thing to traverse a long gloomy avenue Uke that without having the least idea of where it led to, and with^some sus picions that the pathway itself might be of a treacherous character. But that, did not deter him. He stood upon the doorstep. He \"placed his hand on the knocker. And then he paused for a few seconds while he counted tho strokes indicating twelve o'clock, as they pealed forth from the old turret of St. James's Palace. But Heron did not hesitate. He slowly advanced, and had proceeded about six paces, when four more distinct blows at tho knocker of the door proclaimed the arrival of some other visitor in pursuance of the instruc tions given at Holland House. Heron paused. Some one passed him swiftly, brushing against him in the narrow passage. The door was opened. \" A light !\" cried the new visitor. \" I enter no such place as this unless I see my way ! A light, I say !\" The voice was that of Lord Warringdale. \" Wait there a moment,\" said the man who opened the door ; \" wait a moment, and I will light my lantern.\" Felix Heron drew his hat farther down upon his brow, and muffled up the lower part of his face closely in his roquelaire cloak. Lord Warringdale, with the natural timidity belonging to him, wc\\ild not cross the threshold of the house until he saw the glimmer of the porter's lantern. Assuming, then, a swaggering air of audacity, he strolled in, speaking as he came. \" Who has arrived ?\" he asked. The period of action had arrived. - Felix Heron raised the knocker, and was on the point of executing one of those raps, four of which woidd make up the preconcerted signal, when a shadowy looking figure passed directly over from the other side of the way, and stepped on to the doorstep by his side. A glance at this figure sufficed to assure Felix Heron that it was not his half brother, Lord Warringdale. But he was by no means so certain that it was not John Tarleton. The new arrival spoke, and then Felix Heron was aware that whoever he was, he was a perfect stranger to him, and that he was in all probability one of the ruffians who had been present with John Tarleton at Holland House. Heron did not speak, but the new arrival questioned him. \" I suppose it's you, Quiver ?\" For a few seconds Heron hesitated what to do. and then a sudden impulse came over him, and with one well-directed blow he sent this man prostrate into tho kenel, where he lay in a state of semi-insensibility, Heron then dragged him by his shoulders into a neigbouring doorway, and there left him. His idea was just this. Probably four persons were expected. \" One,\" replied the porter. \"Oh! Is it Deuce Ace?\" \" No, my lord,\" replied Felix Heron, in so capitally assumed a voice, and in tones so strangely different from his own, that Warringdale could not have the least suspicion of who ho really was."], [165, "159 EDITH HERON. \" Oh, ;hen, you are one of those worthy gen tlemen who were mailing so free with the bottle at Holland House ?\" the principal light fell from the lantern, was abruptly opened, and a man stepped in. The man was masked. He spoke in a hollow, strange voice, that was evidently assumed. \"My lord;\" said Heron, still speaking in the same assumed voice, \u2022' I Uke my glass, md my lass, and a jolly companion !\" \" Oh, no doubt \u2014 no doubt i\" laughed Warring dale. \" Ah i there is another !\" Bang ! bang ! came four more knocks at the cloor, and while it was being opened Felix Heron took the opportunity of obeying the instructions which had previously been given to him of going to the extreme end of the passage and then turn ing to the left. But, notwithstanding that assumption, Felix Heron felt perfectly sure that the voice was the same as that of the man who had been called \" his grace \" so inadvertently at HoUand House. He commenced speaking abruptly. \"Since you are all here, gentlemen,\" he said, ' it is only necessary that I should explain to you, without descending to minute particulars, the sort of service that is required of you.\" \"Ay, ay! that's it,\" whispered the man who stood next to Heron in his ear. He pushed open a. door covered with green baize, and found himself in a large and what might have been a handsome room, but that it was in a state of great dilapidation and decay. A .table of unusually large dimensions occu lted its centre. \"Bo quiet, Quiver,\" said Heron, in as low a tone, and making a good guess that that was the very personage for who he himself had been mistaken on the doorstep. On this table was a small hand-lantern, the blinding slide of which was partially withdrawn, so that one haU of tho room was dimly lighted while the other half remained almost in perfect obscurity. \"Silence!\" cried Lord Warringdale, in an angry tone. The individual with tho mask continued. \" The service that you will be caUed upon to perform is easy if it be conducte'd with boldness and address ; and for the exercise of those two qualities, the reward, you may depend, wUl bo commensurate.\" Felix Heron preferred to take up his station in the darkest portion of this apartment. He had hardly done so when the green baize door was flung open, and three persons en tered. \" A high reward \u2014 a high reward !\" said John Tarleton. \" I call the reward which has already been mentioned munificent \u2014 that is to say as regards you two, Kufus and Quiver. Two were conversing, and preceded the third, who followed them with a show and appearance of respect. \" AVhat are we to get ?\" said Quiver, sulkily. \" Ftfty guineas each,\" said the man with the mask, \" on each occasion that your services are required.\" \" And what are we to do ?\" Heron had no difficulty in at once detecting, by their voices, that the two who were convers iug wero Lord Warringdale and John Tarleton. The third person was, without doubt, tho companion of the man who had been so sum marily disposed of by FeUx Heron on the door step of tho mysterious house, in an apartment of which he now found himself. \"Simply this. A certain person will be pointed out to you in the streets of London, whom it will be your duty never to lose sight of if possible, but to foUow about from place to place, house to house, and street to street, accompanied as you will be by either a sedan chair or a hackney coach ; and then at some opportune moment, in some bye place, where no human eyes can scan your conduct, you are to seize this person, blind fold them, gag them, and convey them in safety and secrecy to this house.\" \" In the open dayUght?\" asked Quiver. \" Probably.\" \"Humph!\" \" You are at liberty to retire at once from tho task; and there is no doubt that some one .vill be found who will gladly take your place.\" \" Of course, my lord, of course,\" said John Tarleton ; \" there can be no difficulties in the matter, and I th''nk from the few hints you have given mo I fuUy comprehend it-\" \" Do not say 1 givo you hints,\" remarked Warringdale : \" it is not for me to explain what you and your two comrades have to do. That you will hear from another person.\" \" AU's well, then ; but I am ineUned to think \" \" Hush ! think nothing, but keep aU your facul ties about you for what you wiU have to listeu to\" The third man, who was tho subordinate, seemed quite delighted to see FeUx Heron, who in the dark he no doubt took for his companion in iniquity. \" Eufus !\" \" WeU, Quiver ?\" replied Heron. \"What do you say ?\" \"I'll do it?\" He stepped up to him at once. \" That's you, Kufus?\" he said. \" Yes; be quiet!\" replied Heron, in a low \"Well, then, so will I.\" The man with the mask spoke again, and as ho did so he pointed to John Tarleton. \" This gentleman will point out to -you tho particular person whom you are to seize.\" He then pointed to Lord Warringdale, and added, \" And this gentleman will always be near at hand to superintend the proceedings; and to lend you any assistance, either with his purse or with his sword, as may be required.\" \" Certainly !\" said Lord Warringdale. Quiver then asked a question which was quite uppermost on tho lips of Felix Heron. tone. \" Oh, all's right ! \u2014 but how odd you speak !\" \"A cold.\" \"Ah! I told you you'd catch it. You would sleep out in the garden, to keep your head cool, you said, and now you see you can hardly speak.\" \" Silence !\" cried Lord Warringdalo ; \" you come here to listen, not to speak.\" A door at the further end of the room, where"], [166, "160 EDIl'ir lll.l.M-N. \"When dc we begin?\" lie said. \" To-morrow morning !\" replied the man with the mask ; and even as he spoke he turned and abruptly left the apartment, casting upon all the persons within it a glance of supercUious haughti ness that was absolutely insulting. Lord Warringdale then strode to the door at which he had entered, and imitating pretty ac curately the manner of the personage who had iust left, he, too. strode out, leaving the others behind him as though i they were beneath Ms notice. 1 Oh. indeed\"!'' ' Are you the watch ?'\" \" No ; I am a gentleman.\"' \" Oh ' that's a comfort ! Just look out for a doorway here where there's some blinds in the window of the house of \u2014of \u2014 what the plague is the colour ? I suppose rry brains are wool gathering still.\" ' I fancy I know the house yon want.\" said Heron. \" and car- lead you to it '' \" Can you . That's tbe ver; thing I want and you're the verj besi friend I've got.\" \" Can you walk ?' \" Oh. yes. I think so.\" He said something, however, in a few words, to John Tarleton, who, turning round, repeated them to Quiver and the supposed Eufus. \" You will both of you be at the railings of King Charles's statue, at Charing Cross, to morrow morning, at one o'clock.\" \" AU's right !\" said Quiver. John Tarleton then left the room. \"Try.\" Quiver did try but he staggered against Hie railings, and it was evident he had not the power to proceed. This was jus* wha< Felix Heron wanted. \u2022' Take my arm '' he said \"and I will lead you where you want to go. 1 happen to know all about it.\" \" Well, Kufus,' said Quiver, \" it seem? to me we'd better go, too. What do you say to some thing to drink ? There's the ' Magpie and iS tump,' down by Hungers ord \u2014 as good a house as we can go to.\" \" I'll follow you there in half an hour,\" said Heron. \"Do you?' Ferhap? you're one of the gentle men themselves ?\" \" To be sure 1 am ; and we want your services, Quiver.\" \" Ah ! you knew my name too?\" \" I named you in order that you might, have confidence in me. Come on \u2014 this i? the way ; you need give yourself no trouble, and can lean on me as heavily as you like.\" \" AU's right \u2014 all's right ! . But you don't seem half like yourself to-night, Eufus ; and if I didn't know you so weU as I do, I seem as if I should hardly know you at all.\" While this brief dialogue was going on, Felix Heron and Quiver hae. reached the street door of the house. Quiver, in his confused condition, was quite pleased to meet with such a guide and support; and leaning heavily, as he had been told, Upon the arm of Felix Heron, he allowed himself, without the least suspicion of where he was really, going, to be led across the road into St. James's Street, and to the door of Whitcomba House. It was a great object with Heron to get rid of his companion as quickly, now. as possible ; and it was a great relief tc him when Quiver strode off, crying out, as he did so. \" Don't be long, and I'll have a good jorum of punch brewed by the time you get there.\" \" Good !' said Heron. \" That will do !\" Felix Heron had made up' his mind to take this man home, and by fair means or foul, make use of him as a mean? of aiding in the discovery and frustration of the villanie? contemplated by \" his grace \" aided by Lord Warringdale and John Tarieton. As soon as Quaver was out of sight, Heron darted off tc the doorway where he had left the man who, no doubt, was the genuine Kufus. whose name he, Heron had sc succnsshdly assumed. \" Is this the place?\" said Quiver, in a confused manner. \" Yes \" replied Heron, as he knocked sharply at the door oi Whitcombe House. CHAPTEK CCXXXI. Ogle, who knew Heron's knock perfectly well, repUed to the summons. FEI.IX IIEr.ON MAKE? A PRISONER axd A COMPACT. \" Take this man. Ogle.\" said Heron. \" Treat him well, but on nc account allow him to leave Whitcombe House.\" The man lay just where Heron had left him. Probably, in his falL he had struck his head against the pavement, which had done more to confuse his faculties than the blow which Heron had given him. \" Certainly, Captain.\" With a bewildered look, Mr. Quiver allowed himself to be conducted over the threshold of the family mansion of the Whitcombes. It was not likely, however, that he was much hurt ; and Heron at ouce raised him to his feet, holding him up with a strong arm, as he spoke to him. \" Is he wounded, Captain ?\" asked Ogle. He had seen that something was amiss with the person who came with Captain Heron. \" No ; lib is hurt, but not much. Look to him well ; I shall want to speak to him to-mor row.\" \"What's the matter?\" ho said. \"Who and what are you, and what has happened to you ?\" Heron asked these questions in order to ascer tain the mental condition of the fellow, and to enable him to come to some conclusion in regard to his state. Tho hour was now about one in the morning, and as Felix Heron went up-stairs rapidly, ho met Edith, who had been anxiously waiting for him. \"I don't know \u2014 I scarcely know,\" replied Kufus. \" I rather think somebody knocked mo down, or else I've had a drop too much.\" She had in her hand an open letter. A smile was on her face. \" You have heard good news, Edith,\" said"], [167, "161 EDITH HERON. Heron, as he reflected on his own face the swile that lit up hers. \" It is always good news to hear your voice, Felix ; but you allude co this letter. It is from our good and kind friend, the Earl of Bridge water.\" \" Then, Edith, I guess its import.\" \" Yes ; it relates to our marriage.\" Felix Heron, on reaching that suite of rooms on the second floor of Whitcombe House which was especially devoted to the domestic privacy so himself and Edith, read the letter. It ran as follows : \u2014 \" My Deak Whitcombe, \" All is arranged. I have procured a license, without the slightest difficulty, for the union of George Fantome, a captain in his Majesty's navy, with Edith, Countess of Whitcombe. \" A young brother of Colonel Trelawney's, Edith. No. 73. , who is studying at Oxford, but who happens to be in town at present, will perform the ceremony, so that the scruples of Lady Whitcombe on that point will be properly met. \" You and Edith \u2014 and, probably, you will bring Lady Castleneau with you \u2014 should be at the httle old church at Willesden by eleven o'clock. \" The village is so small, and so quiet, and the place so rarely visited, that we need fear no in terim ption. 11 The rector, who performs the service twice each Sunday, fortunately resides some eight or ten miles off, and is not at all likely to make his appearance. \" Be punctual, and believe me, \"Ever your sincere friend, \" Bridgewater.\" \" Then, Edith,\" said Heron, \" these new nuptials take place to-morrow.\""], [168, "162 EDITH HERON. \" That piece of work wiU be discoveied, and, as I have said already, bring you all to the gal lows-\" \"Yes, Felix; and I do hope from my heart that thero will be no longer any occasion for a further disguise thap that whioh you have now assumed as Captain Fantome of the royal navy. But you are thoughtful. Does the sense of any danger oppress you ?\" \" No, Edith ; but I was thinking of how soon I could get to town after the ceremony to-mor row; for I have an appointment at one o'clock, at King Charles's statue, Charing Cross.\" FeUx Heron then detailed to Edith all that had passed at the mysterious house close to St. James's Palace. \" If I thought that, sir, I'd have nothing to do with it, for I'm about as careful of my neck as most men.\" \" You can do better than be careful of your neck by having nothing to say to this transac tion.\" \"Indeed, sir!\" \" Yes. You shaU receive from me the same amount of money that would have brought you into danger, difficulty, and death, and with it you shall have safety and consideration.\" , \" Is this possible?\" \" Yes ; think of it. I wUl speak to you again in a few hours ; in the meantime remain here as my prisoner \u2014 not to be treated with severity, but for your own safety's sake, and because it is ab solutely necessary you should do so.\" FeUx Heron did not wait for any further parley with Mr. Quiver, but at once left the muniment-room. But they could neither of them come to any definite conclusion in regard to what was reaUy meant by the whole proceedings. That some person . or persons were to be kid napped in the streets of London was but too ap parent ; but who they were, and for what purpose this encroachment on public Uberty was to take place, they could not divine. Speculation on such a point was useless ; and Felix Heron, therefore, put off the subject untU tho morning, whert he intended to submit the man Quiver to the test of a severe cross-exami nation. Ogle foUowed him, and carefuUy relocked tho door. \" I am stfll to look close after him, Captain ?\" \"Most certainly ! But now I come to look at him in daylight, I do not altogether so much dis- Uke his looks. Nevertheless, be careful of him, for I am sorry to say I have Uved long enough in the world not to trust altogether to appear ances.\" It was very doubtful, though, if he knew any thing more about it than Heron himself. At an early hour, then, on that foUowing morning Heron met Ogle in the hall of the man sion, and was conducted by him to a strong room in Whitcombe House, which was originally con structed for the purpose of holding the deeds and muniments of the famfly. \"Here's the prisoner, Captain,\" said Ogle. \" I have given him some breakfast, and he's quite Uvely this morning.\" \" That is well.\" FeUx Heron brought this interview with Quiver to a rapid conclusion, because he felt that there was little time to spare between that time and the period when he must start for Willesden, in order to contract the mock marriage of Captain Fan tome with Edith. Ogle opened the iron door of the muniment room, and exhibited Mr. Quiver enjoying an ex cellent morning repast. He had to visit Lady Castleneau, and, U pos sible, bring her with him. On foot, then, and carefuUy disguised stfll as Captain Fantome, Heron rapidly walked towards Bloomsbury. He was quite aware, though, after leaving St. James's Street, that he was dogged by a man who had been leaning against a post. That this was one of Jonathan WUd's emis saries, FeUx Heron did not entertain a doubt. At the sight of Heron, however, he rose, look ing somewhat confused and apprehensive. There was that in the appearance of Felix Heron, which always at once bespoke the gentle man, and commanded respect. Ogle was about to leave the room but Heron made him a sign to remain. Bending, then, a stern glance upon the priso ner, he spoke in tones of calm deUberation, which had a much more terrible significance than as U he had imported any passion into them. But he thought it far better to take no notice of him. Secure in his disguise, which, if it baffled the acute eyes of Jonathan Wild himself, might well be considered as proof against the scrutiny of any of his janissaries or bull-dogs, Heron took his way rapidly towards Castleneau House. The ancient gentlewoman was of course at home, and only too happy to see Heron, whom she looked upon with all the confidence and affection as though he had been a child of he _ own. \"Your name is Quiver,\" he said, \"and lam quite well aware that you are associated with three men in carrying out an enterprise which will bring them probably to the gallows, and you along with tnem !\" \" Three men !\" said Quiver, in doubtful tones. \" Yes. Is it necessary that I should name them to you ? for, if so, I will do it. One of them is a low fellow, of no account, like yourself, and his name is Kufus. The other two call them selves respectively Warringdale and Deuce Ace.\" Mr. Quiver could have no longer any doubt but that the personage who was speaking to him was well informed. With her characteristic energy, Lady Castle neau at once entered into the spirit of the day's proceedings. Old Anthony was summoned to get out that remarkably ancient carriage, which no doubt was the pink of fashion half a century before. The old lady herself made her appearance in one of those stiff old brocade gowns, which cer tainly, without exaggeration, would have stood up of itself, if required to do so. Edith waa ready and waiting at Whitcombfl \"You and your companion, Rufus,\" added Heron, \" are promised fifty guineas each for as sisting in a piece of work which is to be done in the streets of London.\" \" That's true, sir.\""], [169, "163 EDITH HERON. It was weU that he spoke in a low tone, for, at the moment, he was thrown off his guard, and did not assume the kind of voice which, with singular skill, he usually kept up in his character of Captain Fantome. The name was repeated hy every one And WUd, making one of his hideous grimaces, seemed to be acknowledging, in that fashion, the sensation he had created. House; and within another hour, as the three quarters past ten o'clock sounded Ughtly upon the morning air, chimed forth from various vUlage steeples in the verdant neighbourhood of Wil lesden, the little party arrived at the church. At the porch appeared the Earl of Bridgewater, with Lady Bridgewater. Colonel Trelawney and his sister were likewise there. The young man from Oxford, looking quite clerical enough for the occasion, was holding what looked like a very confidential discourse with the sexton. With a blow of bis fist he broke one of the diamond-shaped panes of glass in the little Gothic window. But stiU the orifice was not quite sufficient for him to project his head and face through right into the church. The whole pai -ty entered the church at once. A few of the villagers hastened to the door of the sacred edifice to see what was going on. And then, as the sun shone brightly through the Uttle gothic windows, the mock marriage cere mony was hastUy concluded. It seemed strange indeed to Edith to be stand ing there at the altar along with FeUx Heron again, to whom she had already been a wUe for some years. Another blow demolished the next pane, and Ukewise a portion of the leaden framework be tween them. Then WUd was able to put his head right into the church. In his harshest and most grating tones he spoke. \" Edith, Countess of Whitcombe, you disgrace yourself, and the memory of Felix Heron, by this marriage ! H he could, but for one single hour, start up from his lonely grave, he would not recognise that Edith to whom he had clung so fondly while she leans upon the arm of Cap tain Fantome ; having been, by the force of cir cumstances, only recently separated from the Baron Von Peck !\" \" Mine again, my beloved!\" whispered Heron, as he tenderly drew Edith's hand through his arm. \" Yes, FeUx \u2014 but I feel as though I had been committing some crime in even allowing myself to be married to Captain Fantome \u2014 I who could never bear the thought of \" \" Hush, dear child !\" interrupted Lady Castle neau. \" Think no more of it ! It was necessary, both for your safety and comfort, to give FeUx the right to be always near you !\" '\"Exactly !\" replied Bridgewater. \" A truce to regrets ! Let us hope that from this day wUl date a period of much happiness to you both ! But now let us leave this sacred building ; the sooner we can get clear of the village now the better.\" \" Yes, \" said Felix ; \" and I, too, have an im portant appointment, which wiU now occupy my time for some few hours. Let us hasten to town, dearest !\" he added, turning to Edith. No doubt Jonathan WUd thought this a very severe speech. It was Colonel Trelawney who replied to it. \"You scoundrel!\" he cried out; \"how dare you interfere with what dees not concern you ? I will speak to the Secretary of State, and have your staff and constable's warrant taken away from you !\" \" Try it !\" said Wild, as he smashed another pane of glass, \u2014 \" try it ; and you may discover that Jonathan WUd can do better without the Secretary of State than the Secretary of Stato without Jonathan Wild ! It is to you, Edith, Countess of Whitcombe, I speak, and not to any of the jackdaw friends about you !\" \" I desire to hear nothing,\" said Edith. \" You may mean weU, Jonathan Wild ; and if you do, the best way to show it is, not to interfere with my actions !\" \" Perhaps you think so ; but I have a proposi tion to make, and I have taken some trouble to climb up here to make it !\" Heron was about to speak, but he was checked by Edith, who touched him lightly on the arm, whispering, as she did so, \" Say nothing ; it will be better. I cannot but feel that I owe this man, bad as he is, a certain kind of respect on this oc casion.\" At this moment Edith gave a start, and turned deathly pale as she clung to the arm of Felix for support. \" What is it, my Edith?\" asked Heron, as he cast his eyes in the same direction, and saw, glaring through one of the gothic windows at the upper portion of the church, the hideous counte nance of Jonathan WUd ! CHAPTER CCXXXII. JONATHAN WILD GIVES EDITH A WORD OF AD- VICE. For a few seconds the eyes of all the little party in that venerable suburban edifice, which for more than five hundred years had been de voted to heaven, were fixed upon the face of Wild. \" Look here, Edith, Countess of Whitcombe,\" added Wild \u2014 \"look here, and listen to me. You have a son \u2014 the son of Felix Heron \u2014 son of a brave aud gallant father. Captain Fantome won't Uke him \u2014 step-fathers never do \u2014 and he won't like Captain Fantome. Now, give the boy to me, and I'll take care of him, and bring him up re spectably.\" \" VUlain ! \" cried FeUx Heron. Amid the quietude of the scene, and the eccle siastical serenity of the little church, that hideous countenance, which seemed a complete map of every human passion which could deform and degrade humanity, was tho one blot and marring influence which should not have been there. \"Jonathan Wild !\" exclaimed Felix Heron. \"Ha, ha! \" \" Hush\u2014 oh, hush ! \" said Edith. \" No, Jonathan Wild ; if you have the ehghtest regard for me, or"], [170, "EDITH HERON. 164 There was a smaU grating in the door of the muniment-room, by which air could De admitted to it by sliding back a panel about the size of a man's hand, that covered it. Very carefuUy \u2014 for he heard no sound within the room \u2014 FeUx Heron removed this panel. He looked in at his prisoner. The man was seated at the only table in the place, resting his head upon his hands in a dis consolate attitude. feehng tor the child of Felix Heron, you will not indulge in these insulting propositions.\" Edith did not wait for a reply from Wild, but taking the arm of FeUx Heron, she hastily left the church, accompanied by the whole of the Uttle party. A tew paces from the door there was a horse with its bridle attached to a cross surmounting a tomb- That horse had evidently been ridden hard, for there was foam upon its coat, and there could be no doubt that it was the steed that had brought Jonathan Wild down to Wlllesden. He seemed to be in a state of affliction. Deep sighs came from his labouring breast. Heron, by placing his ear to the Uttle grating, could just detect the words he uttered. \" AU lost\u2014 all lost !\" he said. \" A youth of frivoUty, devoted to false pleasure ; a manhood of disgrace ; and after that what have I to look forward to ?\" Before the wedding party could get well clear ot the porch of the church, Wild appeared. \" FareweU !\" he cried. \" FareweU, Edith, Countess of Whitcombe. I pity as weU as blame you. And as for you, Captain Fantome, you may be quite sure that I shall keep an eye on your movements, so look to yourself.\" \"Wreck me on a lee shore,\" said Heron, \"if I'm not half incUned to put au end to your move ments at once, for this impertinent interference in my affairs.\" \" Ha, ha !\" laughed Wild, as he sprung to the back of bis horse. \" We shall see \u2014 we shaU see ; and those that live the longest wiU see the most.\" Heron was well pleased to find his prisoner in this framas of mind- He opened the door of the muniment-room, and entered at once. The man started to his feet, and looked as if he anticipated some immediate danger, but Felix Heron quickly calmed him on that score. \" It is not too late,\" he said ; \" the opportunity still presents itseU to you of changing your mode of life, and of inaugurating a new career, by an act which wiU go far towards obliterating the past.\" \" Who and what are you ?\" \" I am, as far as you are concerned, Captain Fantome ; what I may further be, it will depend upon your conduct for you to learn.\" \"But what do your words imply? Those words, I mean, which I have just now heard you utter ?\" WUd once more bent a glance of anger at the whole party, and then galloped off. \" We shall never see the last of that feUow,\" said the Earl of Brf.lgewater. \"Until he is hanged,\" remarked Colonel Tre lawney; \" which I am quite sure wUl be his fate, for he has already become notorious for dealing in stolen goods, aud compounding felonies. The rascal is a disgrace to the age in which we live ; and when he is once disposed of, were the world to last another twenty thousand years, society will not again look upon such a man as Jonathan Wild.\" \" Take them at their fuU meaning,\" replied Felix Heron, \" and I will find a means of carry ing them out for you into action.\" \"Is it possible,\" said Quiver, \"that the op portunity presents itself to me of once more re tracing the fearful path I have trodden so long, and seek another of peace and serenity ?\" \" It is possible ! You have but to be sincere with me \u2014 aud let me tell you, it wUl be some what dangerous to be otherwise \u2014 and all may yet be weU with you. \" \" Direct me what I have to do,\" repUed Quiver, with fervour, \" and I wiU most assuredly do it.\" \" There is an appointment, then, at the statue of King Charles, at Charing Cross ?\" \" There is. I recoUect it now; but my brain has been somewhat confused.\" The Earl of Bridgewater had brought down his own carriage, which was at a little inn on Willesden Green, so that three quarters of an hour more sufficed to bring them all back to Whitcombe House, where Captain Heron, in his assumed namo of Captain Fantome, intended openly to show himseU as its proprietor and master. It was half-past twelve o'clock, however, so that he had Uttle time to spare before attending to the mysterious appointment at King Charles's statue. It was necossary, however, before proceeding on that errand, that Felix Heron should have another interview with the man Quiver, who was still a prisoner at Whitcombe House. Felix Heron did not care at that precise mo ment to explain to Quiver that that confusion of tho brain arose principally from the knock down blow he had given him. \" It is sufficient that you recollect the appoint ment,\" he said. \" It is for one o'clock, and that hour rapidly approaches.\" \" Yes, one was the hour.\" That this man was in the possession of valu able information, although he professed to know eo little of the enterprise in which ho was en gaged, FeUx Heron had a strong suspicion. He summoned Ogle, and procured from him the key of the muniment-room. \" I wUl visit this man myseU,\" he said; \" there are some people who will speak out moro freely to one person than to two.\" \" Keep a bright look-out, Captain,\" said Ogle ; \" these kind of fellows are not to bn trusted.\" Heron was weU enough pleased to see that Quiver had sufficiently recovered his senses fully to recollect the appointment, as well as the pre cise hour at which it was to come off. \" Listen to me, now,\" he said. \" I am per fectly aware that some unexampled piece of vil lany is in agitation.\" \" And I, too.\" \" Give me, thon, a tost of your sincerity by explaining what it ia ?\" \"Be assured of that, Ogle. My interview with him must likewise be a brief one, for I am en gaged at one o'clock, aad would not bo late yh any consideration.\""], [171, "165 EDITH HERON. It was quite evident that Lord Warringdale was the guide of the whole proceeding. Eufus aud Quiver kept their eyes upon him as the person whom they were to follow. And John Tarleton with the coach brought up the rear. \" I cannot, for I do not know ; Lord Warring dale and the man who calls himself Deuce Ace, no doubt, know aU about it ; but Eufus and I, who are merely considered as paid underUngs, know nothing of the particulars.\" \" I will believe you.\" \" You may, sir, for I speak the truth.\" \" Go, and keep your appointment, then. I shall be there, likewise ; but I shall keep myself sufficiently far off, that while I do not abso lutely lose sight of you and your party, they will not suspect that I am watching them. If I see cause for interference, I shall interfere ; but if not, I require that you come back to this house, and bring me such particulars of what is intended as you can gather.\" \" I wUl. I swear it !\" The feelings of the parties, however, engaged in that nefarious transaction would probably have been of a very different character from what they were, conld they have suspected for a moment that the well-known Captain Felix Heron, Earl of Whitcombe, was actually on their track. Warringdale turned up a by-street in the Strand, which led towards the neighbourhood of Covent Garden. Eufus Quiver and the coach followed him. And Heron foUowed them. \" I am better contented with your mere as surance than with your oath.\" , Warringdale made a signal. The coach stopped. Eufus and Quiver hid themselves on the side It wanted but six or seven minutes to one o'clock ; but the distance from Whitcombe House to Charing Cross was so short, that it could easily be passed over in that period of time. Heron took one side of tho way and Quiver the other. of it, nearest to the pavement on the side whero they were. Lord Warringdale then paced slowly down the street, and as he did so, he cast his eyes up at -a particular house. The house was evidently some place of busi ness, and by some patterns that hung in the' window, Heron considered it to be a dress maker's. Heron hid himseU in a doorway, and he saw his late prisoner join a man who, doubtless, was Eufus, and who was leaning against the railings which were then around the base of the statue. From the direction of Whitehall two figures approached. Felix Heron had no difficulty in recognising them as Lord Warringdale and John Tarleton. They joined the two men at the base of the statue. A small fruiterer's shop was immediately op posite ; and into that, without exciting any ob servation, Heron made his way. He purchased some fruit, and affecting to eat it, he looked through the window carefully. The station he occupied was an excellent one for observing the whole proceedings of Lord Warringdale and his party. And to tell the truth, those proceedings were singular enough. The whole four stood closely together for a few seconds, discoursing with great earnestness. Then* conduct then became most mysterious. John Tarleton went up to the stand of hackney coauhes close to Northumberland House, and brought back to the immediate vicinity of the statue one of those old lumbering vehicles, with its driver and its two worn-out wretched horses. Some proposition was evidently made to the driver of the coach, which, for some reasons, he strenuously objected to. Then Felix Heron, who was particularly sharp sighted, saw Lord Warringdale slip some pieces of gold into his hand. Those powerful arguments removed tho man's scruples in regard to what was proposed to him, and gathering his coat of many capes about him, ho left his coach and horses in the hands of the party by the statue, and crossed over the way to the neighbourhood of Hungerford, where, no doubt, in somo one of the numerous pubUc-houses of that locality, he intended to enjoy himseU until his coach was brought back. John Tarleton mounted the coach-box. It was now half-past one o'clock, and scarcely had the hour been pealed forth by the ancient church of St. Paul's, Covent Garden, which pre ceded by many years the piesent structure, when the door of the house towards which Lord War ringdale had cast several observant glances opened. Two young girls came forth. Heron thought that now something was about to happen which would let him into the heart of the mystery. But he was disappointed. Not the sUghtest notice was taken of theso girls by Lord Warringdale _nd his associates. Then several more young women, all evidently belonging to tho class of workers for their daily bread, came out of that house. They went to the right or to the left, as their different routes required, and Heron came to tho the not unnatural conclusion that this was the\" dinner-hour of a number of young women whose place of work was within that house. But without tho sUghtest molestation, and only the merest passing regard, Lord Warring dale, as he passed to and fro, let them aU disap pear. Lord Warringdale walked on some distance in advance, up the Strand. Eufus and Quiver strolled along just a few faces in advance of the vehicle, as if they had nothing whatever to do with it. What could this mean ? What mystery was enshrouded in all these proceedings ? Heron was puzzled. But he was determined that that bewilderment should not last longer than necessary, and he carefully foUowed the coach. The door opened again. One young girl came forth. Heron involuntarily sprung to his feet. He felt quite certain that now he began to un derstand what was intended. This young girl was plainly attired, and her"], [172, "166 EDITH HERON. general appearance betokened that painful strug gle with poverty which respectability and fallen fortunes have so often to make. Holland House, and enabled him to overhear so much of the plot in progress as had brought him to the spot he now occupied, to foU it and pro tect the innocent. But no plainness of attire. No shabby or well-worn garments. Not even the old cloak she wore, darned in Then the young girl stepped lightly down from the steps of the house to the pavement. She drew her old faded cloak more closely around her. many places, could conceal the native grace and beauty of this girl. A few wandering locks of beautiful hair escaped from her head-dress, resting like sunlight upon her neck and shoulders. Heron was too far off to hear it, but he fancied he could see by her actions that a sigh was on her lips. Some painful thought may have crossed her mind. Heron told himself at once that this was the girl sought by Lord Warringdale, in the interest of his infamous employers of that mysterious house near St. James's Palace, and he determined to act accordingly, and to thwart their designs, let them be what they might. Perhaps she was hastening home with the scant earnings of her hard toU to some near and dear to her, who depended even upon her exer tions for support. Warringdale made another sign. He followed the girl. The coach moved on. Eufus and Quiver kept close to it ; and, Uttle suspecting that such a cavalcade was at her heels, this fair young creature went Ughtly, though sadly, on her way. CHAPTER CCXXXIII. THE CONSPIRATORS MEET WITH AN OBSTACLE AND A CANE. FeUx Heron only paused for a few seconds, and then he left the fruit shop. On the other side of the way to that which was occupied by Lord Warringdale he paced slowly along. But he kept a sufficient distance not to give the villanous party any alarm ; whUe at the same time he was not so far off but that at a bound or two he could have reached the scene of action. It needed not that Heron should observe the prompt signal made by Lord Warringdale to John Tarleton, and the two men Eufus and Quiver to convince him that he was perfectly correct in his conjectures. From the moment that that young girl ap peared it seemed to him as if a cloud or filmy vapour had been suddenly dashed aside from be fore the whole proceedings, and he understood their scope and import perfectly. This young girl had excited the admiration, no doubt, of the person caUed \" his Grace ;\" and the duty of Warringdale, John Tarleton, and their two associates was to seize her, even in the public streets of London, and convey her to the house by the Palace. Little did she know her danger. As little, too, did she know her safety. How could she suspect that four men were intently watching her, leagued together for her destruction ? The girl went on. She turned down another street. The whole party foUowed her. And yet another turning was taken. That led father suddenly into a large open space, which Felix Heron recognised as Soho Square. The houses even then in that square were UuU and dreary-looking, and the place was sUent and nearly deserted. The girl crossed the square, and went down one of those long, narrow streets, the tall houses in which, no doubt once fashionable, had long since given up the idea of even keeping up ap pearances. And how could she suspect that there was a fifth man, of whose eventful life and history she might probably have'heard something, who was as determined to save her ? There was not a soul in that street. But such was the case. Warringdale made another sign. The coach went quicker. Eufus and Quiver accelerated their pace. He who was called Eufus even ran round the This young creature paused for a few seconds on the doorstep, and looked about her. It seemed as if she enjoyed the sight of the open daylight, and was grateful that she could breathe the free air of heaven, even for a short time, unrestrained by labour. coach, and assumed a place upon the pavement of the street, about twenty paces in advance of the young girl. She looked upward. A crisis seemed approaching. Heron loosened his sword in its scabbard. She seemed to be watching for a few seconds the fleecy vapours that careered over the sky. And as she so looked upward, Felix Heron had an opportunity of seeing her face well. It was very beautiful. It was one of thos3 faces that carry with them a charming childlike look, as though under no circumstances whatever could the purity and innocence of thc soul within bo really soiled or destroyed. Warringdale went into a doorway, leaving his subordinates to carry out the special rascality on hand. Aud all unconscious of danger, the girl went on her way. She was within about four or fivo paces of Eufus, and Quivor was not much more than that distance behind her. Tho coach stopped. FeUx Heron felt that the moment oi action The sympathies of Heron were strongly ex cited, and more than over was he convinced that it was not aU accident that had taken him to had come. He was on the very point of crossing over tha"], [173, "167 EDITH HERON. way and actively interfering in the transaction, when the door of the house exactly opposite to where the young girl was opened, and an elderly gentleman, with a remarkably stout bamboo walking cane, came out. The interference or the presence of a chUd would have been sufficient to protect the young girl from the abduction with which she was threatened. From the doorway in which he was hidden, Lord Warringdale clapped his hands. That was a preconcerted signal. Eufus and Quiver scrambled up .on to tho coach. This was exceedingly mat apropos for the conspirators who wero so intent upon their cap ture. The position of affairs, but for the serious ness of the circumstances, would have been perfectly ludicrous. John Tarleton urged the horses to speed by vigorous appUcations of the whip, and in a few seconds the vehicle had got clear of the narrow, dingy street, and had turned a corner. The enterprise was frustrated, but Felix Heron scarcely knew whether to be pleased or otherwise, since it might be carried out on another occasion, when no one was present to interfere, and he himself might not be on the spot. The coach had stopped. Lord Warringdale was in hiding. The man Eufus had one arm outstretched for tho purpose of grasping the arm of the young girl- Quiver occupied a similar attitude on the other side of her. John Tarleton was bending down from the coach-box, looking pale and terrified, as his coward disposition shrunk from what was about to happen. It was strange, then, to see these two men, Felix Heron and Lord Warringdale, half brothers as they were, left alone in that street. Tho one knowing the other so well, but tho other in utter ignorance of the proximity of tho person whom he had injured so deeply. Heron felt quite confident in his disguise, and walked slowly down the street, actually past Lord Warringdale. Perhaps the look that Heron was enabled to give his haU-brother on that occasion was the most steady and observant one that ho had cast upon him for years. He saw the ravages that crime and dissipation had made on his countenance. And last, although not least in the consideration of all theso circumstances, there was Felix Heron, with his eyes placed upon the principal parties and Iris hand on the hilt of his sword, ready to dash forward at a moment's notice, and rescue the girl from her persecutors. Bnt he soon saw that there was no occasion for him to interfere. The old gentleman who had emerged from the house was of an exceedingly irascible tempera ment. He had that expression upon his face of being constantly in a passion, and on this occasion was quite delighted to encounter quickly circumstances which apparently caUed forth all his indignation. The young girl could hardly be said to know her own danger ; but she uttered a natural cry of alarm at finding herself so suddenly hemmed in and surrounded. He saw the shifting eyes and the twitching muscles of that face, wh ch was constantly tho index of some hidden fears. And Heron felt tempted to speak to him. He even paused for a moment, and haU opened his Ups. But he resisted the impulse. A coach on one side. He passed on. Of all men living, was he to entrust Warring dale with the secret of his identity, so carefuUy kept from all the world beside ? They passed each other, and Heron made the best of his way hack to Whitcombe House. He fully expected that Quiver would make his appearance shortly ; nor was he disappointed, for in the course of an hour after he had returned home, Ogle came to him to say that Quiver had arrived. A house on the other. A man before and a man behind her, each seemingly intent upon obstructing her progress, were circumstances which might well create au undefined alarm in the breast of this girl. She cried out, then, for help. Help from she knew not what. But stUl from seeming danger. The old gentleman was delighted. Here was something that caUed for his inter- ference. At first glance of this man, now, Heron fancied that there was a pecuUar look about his eyes that he ought to distrust. Something that enabled him to be in as great a rage about as he pleased. The thick walking-cano descended in a blow upon tho back of Kufus, that sounded quite alarming. But he did not aUow that altogether to sway him, since he had no real reason for doubting his good faith. \"WeU, sir,\" said Quiver, \"I suppose we now know aU about it ?\" Quiver came in for the next application. \" Pascals ! thieves! vagabonds!\" shouted the old gentleman, while his face from red became of a purple tinge, and he darted about ou the pave ment with extraordinary agiUty. Nothing in the world would have been easier than for Quiver aud Eufus at once to ha'% got the better of their elderly assaUant. But that woald have made a disturbance. \" I fancy so.\" \" That young girl, you see,, sir, is to be kid napped quietly and sUently, and taken to the house by the Palace.\" \" That is evident enough.\" \" Yes, sir ; and you saw how it failed.\" \" I did ; but I presume it wUl be tried again ?\" \" Oh, yes, sir, to-morrow, at the same hour. The girl works at the house she came out of. She is very poor, and an artificial flower-maker. She goes home to dinner between one and two ; The mission t_cy were on must he conducted with silence, secrecy, and despatch, unobserved by any human eye, or it must bo for that time, at aU events, abauduned."], [174, "168 EDITH HERON. I and it was thought she might be easily nabbed in some bye-street about Soho.\" \"And what is further arranged ?\" \" It's to be tried again to-morrow, sir.\" \" At the same hour ? \" of Kensington Gardens, which, until quite re cently, was familiar to the inhabitants of the metropoUs, Tom Eipon had made his way, escap ing, by that simple man\u0153uvre, the pursuit of Jonathan Wild. \" Oh, no ; an attempt will be made when she leaves work at night. It will be dark then, and aU the safer and easier, they think.\" \" For those substantial reasons, then,\" asked FeUx Heron, \"why was the attempt of to-day made in dayUght ?\" \" That's just what I asked Eufus, sir, and he said it was because she was quite certain to come out between one and two in the day ; but when she left work in the evening it might be any time between eight and ten, or even eleven.\" \" Then, to-morrow call for me here, and I wUl accompany you again ; and be assured that I shaU keep my word with you, and that far from losing anything, you shaU immensely gain by acting with me, and against your former associates.\" \" I'm only too happy, sir,\" said Quiver. \" I never did Uke the Use I was leading ; only, un less I happen to meet a gentleman Uke you, who wiU take me out of it, what chance had I ?\" \" WeU, well, be faithful.\" \" You may make sure of that, sir.\" Quiver left Whitcombe House, and Captain Heron called to Ogle. \" Follow that man,\" he said, \"and see where he goes.\" Tom took the precaution of possessing himself of the key, which being inadvertently, as it ap peared, left by some one in the gate, had enabled him to pass through it. WUd came to a halt, for his attentive ears missed the tread of Daisy on the roadway. He felt confident that Tom had hidden some where, but where that could be completely puzzled him. The market gardens to the right were, to be sure, accessible to such a steed as Daisy, because she could have leaped the ditch, which, black, fetid, and stagnant, had flowed by the roadside for many a long year. She Ukewise could have cleared the raiUnga on the other side of that ditch. But Jonathan felt confident that no such man\u0153uvre had been practised, since, even at that hour, there was sufficient Ught over the open space occupied by the gardens to enable him to see any such feat, U it had been performed. Then where had Tom gone ? To the left there was nothing but that im mense wall, at least twelve feet high, with the heavy brick abutments, over which no mortal steed could ever make its way. Wild muttered to himseU. \" He knows me too well, Captain ; but here's Mrs. Ogle just going out, and she'U do it capi tally.\" \" Was it real or a matter of imagination ? Did I see him, or did I not ? Or was it some phan tom in the likeness of the horse and its rider, known to me so weU ? Ah ! here is a gate ; if it be open now, it solves the difficulty.\" Wild halted at the very gate through which Tom had passed with Daisy. He tried it carefully, and then more forcibly. It resisted him, because Tom had securely locked it ou the inner side. Mrs. Ogle did follow Quiver, and her report when she came back was, that he met another man at the corner of Pall Mall, whom he slapped familiarly on the back, and then that, with much laughing together, they went down towards Westminster. Heron was dubious what to do. He had a suspicion that aU was not right. Under such circumstances, he did the wisest \" No,\" said Wild, \" he couldn't get in here. I'll ride down the road a little way, and see what comes of it.\" thing by immediately consulting with Edith. Her opinion was immediately pronounced, to the effect that Quiver was not to be trusted. Tom was just on the inner side of the gate, and heard what WUd said very well. \"Plague take you!\" whispered Tom. \"Why don't you go home, and leave a fellow to find his own adventures on the highway ?\" Tom was much nearer an adventure than he imagined. She was firmly convinced, from a review of all the circumstances, that the next attempt at the capture of the young girl would be on that night, instead of the night following, and that Heron was only told otherwise to throw him completely off his guard. This opinion coincided very much with his own ; and he resolved that, come what might, he would keep watch about the house from which the young artificial flower-maker had emerged in the morning, and still save her, if any attempt wero made in the evening to carry her off. WUd had trotted onward, and Tom had just turned the key in the lock of the gate, preparatory to emerging again into the high road from the gardens, when a shght push from without thrust it open a short distance, and a female voice said in accents of alarm, \"Alfred \u2014 AUred, is it you? Are you there ? for I cannot stay a moment.\" There was something pleasant about this voice. So pleasant, indeed, that Tom had a great desfre to look in the face of its owner. CHAPTER CCSXXIV. \" Yes, I'm here,\" he said. TOM MEETS WITH A ROMANTIC ADVENTURE IN KENSINGTON GARDENS. \" Oh, I thought you would be. I left the key in the lock, and it has not been missed ; but I cannot stay, Alfred ; my uncle, Sfr WUUam, is at home ; and you know what he is.\" \" Bather !\" said Tom. Leaving Felix Heron to make his arrangements to frustrate the villany of Lord Warringdale and his infamous employers, we once moro repair to tho Bayswater Eoad. Through a small gate in that long, dreary wall \" What did you say, Alfred ?\" \" I said ' Come in,' my dear. You'll catch cold in the chink of tho door.\""], [175, "169 EDITH HERON. \" Why, Alfred, I should say that is just what you have done ; for your voice is not at all like what it usually is.\" \"Never mind a fellow's voice,\" said Tom, \"so long as his heart's in the right place.\" \" Why, what odd things you do 6ay to-night, Alfred !\" The young lady \u2014 for such, indeed, she was \u2014 came through the little gate into the gardens. Tom adroitly closed the gate, aud turned the key iu it. \" Keep close, Daisy,\" he said. \"Daisy!\" cried the young lady. \"Is that a new name you have got for me ? Why, the last time you were here you said you would call me .lie forlorn Sophonisba !\" \" The forlorn who ?\" said Tom. \"Oh, V..11, my dear, I'll call you wl._t y_u like.\" \"Ah me !\" sighed the young lady, as she took Tom's arm. \" \"What a life we lead ! loving in secret, and only meeting now and then in stealth, through the kindness and connivance of Cleo patra.\" Tom began to have his suspicions that the young lady was not quite right in the upper storey. \" Oh, yes,\" he said : \" that's all true, Cleopate-a, as you say. It's an odd name though, isn't it ? and I'm quite sure I never heard it before.\" \"What, Alfred? Never heard the name of the great Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt?\" \"Ah!\" thought Tom; \"Meat's a settler. It's quite clear that this yoeeng lady is a little out of her mind, and I hardly know what to say to her.\" But the voice of the young lady was sweet, \" Sophonisba.\" \" It's long for Sophv, I suppose.' \u00ab Now, really, Alfred !\" No. 74. Edith."], [176, "170 EDITH HERON. and soft, and clear ; and Tom Eipon, with his usual susceptibility in such matters, began to feel already half smitten by the charms of his acci dental companion. The fear of committing himself by some ex pression that would at once let her know he was a stranger both to her and to the Alfred for whom she mistook him, kept him very silent. And AUred, Jjrobably, was of the loquacious order of beings, for the young lady complained of the silence. Envious fate interfered. A strange sound came upon the night air, which, U they had been in the back woods of some primitive region, might have filled them with dread at the approach of some wild a-nimal seek ing its prey. It was a concentrated kind of howl, accom panied by a battering noise at the gate through which Tom and the young lady had entered tho gardens. \"Gracious heavens!\" cried the forlorn Sopho nisba. \" What's that ?\" \" You scarcely say a word to the forlorn So phonisba to-night.\" \" Oh, don't I ?\" \" I've not the least idea!\" said Tom. Then a voice in accents of rage shouted out, \"Sophy! Sophy! Sophy, you reprobate girl! is it possible that you are here? Answer me directly!\" \" My uncle !\" cried the forlorn Sophinisba, as she turned haU round and feU backward into Tom's arms. \" Certainly you do not. What is amiss ?\" \" It's my bad cold, I suppose.\" \" How very unromantic, Alfred, to take cold ! But I suppose it cannot be helped.\" \" No,\" said Tom, \" it can't be helped.\" \" And al our arrangements continue as be fore ?\" \"My uncle!\" \"What a noisy old pump!\" said Tom. \" We are lost !\" \" Oh, yes,\" rephed Tom ; \" every one of them.\" \"How surprised my uncle wUl be !\" \"I should think he would,\" rephed Tom ; \" but we don't care about that.\" \" Found, I think !\" \" Oh ! oh ! oh ! What wiU become of us ? We must fly at once, AUred \u2014 -we must fly at once to some sweet isle of the ocean, where it is always summer, and peaches and apricots grow wild \u2014 there we can live in bUss and security ! \" Oh, not in the least ! And, here, Alfred, is another little packet ; so that bit by bit, and in degrees this way, I shaU get away aU my jewels, which Sir WilUam, I am sure, would never let me have, if I ran away with you, and married without his consent.\" \" ' And love alone shaU be onr lot, The world forgetting, and the world forgot!'\" The young lady placed in Tom's hands a small packet, which, from its weight, and from what she had said, he concluded contained gold and precious stones. Here was an adventure! \" But I don't see it !\" said Tom. \" How are we to get there ?\" \" On the wings of our mutual affection ! \" \"Sophy! Sophy!\" roared the voice again. \" I am quite sure you are here, you wretched girl ; and as soon as I catch you, you shall be locked up in the attic for the remainder of your days, and fed on bread and water.\" \" Yes, it is my uncle,\" sobbed Sophonisba. \" It is Sir WilUam. There has been some fearful treachery. Alfred, what is to be done ? Is it to be an attic in Bayswater, or the soft seclusion of a paradise in the Pacific Ocean ?\" \" I hardly know ! \" said Tom. \" Let's hear what the old buffer says next.\" \" Bring the ladder here, Pompey ! \" \" What does he mean by that ? Who's Pompey?\" \" Cleopatra's husband. She is faithful, but ho is not. We are discovered, and your Sophonisba casts herseU upon your faithful heart for safety and for succour.\" It was better than crying \" Stand and deUver!\" on the highway. \" My dear,\" said Tom, \" I will take all the care in the world of these jewels ; only there is one thing more I should like to have.\" \" What's that ?\" \"A kiss.\" \" Oh, AUred ! I don't know what has come over you. Time was when you never asked for such a thing.\" \"Oh, very well,\" said Tom, \"if you've any particular objection \" The young lady uttered a small, faint scream. \" Bless us ! what's the matter ?\" said Tom. \"You're a wretch, Alfred! All men are wretches ; but you are the worst of all !\" \" Why, what have I doue ?\" \" Nothing.\" \" Then how could I help it?\" \"That's just it. You used to take a lass, and not ask for it ; but now, I suppose, you are bec6ming unfaithful to your forlorn Sophonisba.\" \"Oh, that's it!\" thought Tom. \"Here you are!\" \" Oh, I comprehend ! \" said Tom. \" The old chap's going to get over the wall by a ladder. Now, I tell you what you do, my dear. He'll come into the garden like a mad bull, and take a rush forward, and that'll be your opportunity of sUpping out at the gate, and going quietly home.\" The forlorn Sophonisba had certainly then no reason to complain of any particular backward ness on Tom's part in kissing, and probably she became rather surprised at the unusual ardour of the supposed Alfred. \" And we are not to fly ? \" \" I think not, yet.\" \"Alfred!\" \" Sophonisba ! \" \" You are a wretch ! \" This was all very pleasant. Tom Bipon had the packet of gold and jewels in his pocket ; and he was enjoying au interview with a very pretty girl amid the shadows of tho old trees in Kensington Gardens.

Sophonisba began to cry, but. Tom Bipon led her to the little gate, of which he stiU retained the key, and carefuUy opened it. It was at a very opportune moment that he did so, for the ladder had just been placed against the waU, and as the door opened outwards, it struck against that ladder, and down it came, bringing with it the irascible Sir WUUam with a grand crash. T'.e old gentleman started. lie was struck dumb with terror and amaze- ment. Tho obstacle that the lantern had struck against was the barrel of a pistol, presented full at his head by Tom Bipon. By the light of the lantern, Ukewise, Sir WiUiam could easily see his opponent in# the scarlet and gold miUtary costume which Tom had procured from Wardour Street. \"Murder! murder! You viUain, Pompey! why didn't you hold the ladder ? You have let it go now, and I am half smashed !\" \" Oh, massa, massa !\" cried a voice in the evi dent accents of a negro, \"it's Pompey be half smash, with massa and de ladder on de top ob bis back !\" \" Now, Sir WUUam,\" said Tom, \" your money or your life!\" \"What?\" \" Your money or your life !

Take your last look of it, old gentleman, for it will soon be on mine.\" \"You villain!\" \" Get along as quick as you can,\" whispered Tom to Sophonisba. The young lady fled, anything but impressed with the real romantic affection of her admirer, and wondering what had come over Alfred, that he should turn out so common-place a personage. Tom closed and locked the gate again, and then he was much amused at a colloquy that took place between Sir WilUam and Pompey, his black servant. . Come, come \u2014 no hard words. A slight pres sure of my fore-finger, Sir William, ou the trigger of this pistol, and you're a dead man.

Pompey wiU hold him tight !\" \" Take care you do.\" Sir William got up the ladder on to the top of the waU ; and then, with some difficulty, dragged it over, and placed it on the other side. \"Ha, ha!\" he said. \"Now we shall see what we shall see !\" Diving his hand into the capacious pocket of his broad-skirted coat, the old gentleman pro duced a lantern, and withdrawing the shde of it, showed that it was lighted. \" Then this is all a trick?\" \" What is ?\" \" About Sophy. She is not here ; and this is merely a plan to get me into the gardens to rob me.\" \" Upon my life,\" said Tom, \" you're not such an old fool as you look !\" \" You admit that it is so ?\" \" Most certainly. The young lady you call Sophy has nothing whatever to do with it ; and, I dare say, is at this present moment fast asleep in bed, dreaming of bread and butter aud little cherubs !\" \" The vUlain Pompey !\" \"No ; he's only a fool !\" \" The black scoundrel !\" \" Yes, he's black ; but in this case he's been done brown. But be quick ; my time is valuable, as you may easily guess by the few minutes I shaU take in possessing myself of all that you have about you worth my carrying away.\" The old gentleman, with a sigh, surrendered his watch. Slowly and carefully he got down the ladder; and then, turning round, he was in the act of holding up the lantern so as to cost its rays as widely about him as possible, when its tin case With a groan, he placed in Tom's hands a 'wall filled purse.

But curiosity was a much stronger element in Tom's character than alarm. Tom put that on his own finger. The ruby brooch was next surrendered. Tom stuck that rather ostentatiously in his own cravat. \" Now old 'un,\" said Tom, \" the sooner you go the better. There's tho ladder \u2014 you know the way, and by the time you're half-way home, I shall be out of the gardens by another gate, where my horse is waiting for me, and you wiU never see me more.\" He paused, therefore, to ascertain what tho low, mysterious knocking at the gate portended. The knocking was repeated three times. Then some one spoke. The voice was a piping sort of treble, and the tones wero in singing accents. \" I hope I shall,\" said the old gentleman. \" Well, if you've another purse, another watch, another diamond ring, and another ruby brooch to hand to me, I don't care how soon I favour you with another interview.\" \" You are an audacious scoundrel, and I hope some fine day to see you dancing.\" \" Arise, arise\u2014 Sophonisba, arise, And let your true lover Look into your eyes.\" The knocking was repeated, and Tom almost laughed aloud, as he said to himself, \" If that isn't Alfred, I'm a Frenchman !\" The voice continued. \" I like a dance !\" \" But upon nothing, I mean \u2014 at Tyburn.\" Tom laughed. The old gentleman ascended the ladder, but the __tle incident that had taken place in the garden. had shaken his nerves, and he was not able to draw it up after him and place it on the other side. \" Sweet love, I am here, By the fair star-light, Your Alfred so dear, 'Mid the shadows of night Then, dear Sophonisba, Tom saw the difficulty. \"Let me,\" he said; \"IU give you a helping hand. HiUoa ! Below there, Pompey !\" Tom seized the ladder, and, with one impulse, canted it over the wall. Breathe but one sigh To the heart of your Alfred, \"Who for Sophy could die.\" \" WeU, I never !\" thought Tom ; \" I've heard lots of songs in aU sorts of cribs, but nothing so bad as that ! I suppose he's made it out of his own head !\" Pompey raised a shout of dismay, for it came full upon him, and prostrated him at once. The old gentleman roared and swore im mensely, and it was fuU five minutes before the terrified and bruised Pompey could assist his master down from the waU and homewards. The tapping at the gate continued. Tom very slowly and gently inserted the key in the lock, and opened the gate. The moment it was free of its fastening it was flung wide, and some one evidently feU into the gardens on aU fours. \" Gracious heavens, Miss Sophonisba, the gate has opened precipitately, and your Alfred is at your feet !\" \"Sweet love, arise,\" said Tom. \"Where's your eyes ? This is the night, and it's not very bright. Get on to your feet ; ain't it a treat ?\" \" Blessed vision !\" exclaimed AUred. \" My for lorn Sophonisba speaks in music ! Where are you, loved one ? I am late, but I thought I saw a disturbance close to this spot. Speak to me \u2014 oh, speak to me, Ught of the eyes of your AUred I Where are you, my Sophonisba ?\" \" Here,\" said Tom. \" Eh ?\" Tom was alone again in Kensington Gardens. He was intensely amused by the events of the evening, and when he came to think over its results, he fully expected that kind fortune had placed in his hands accidentaUy a far better booty than as if he had gone in the regular way of the high road. CHAPTEB CCXXXV. TOM RITON MEETS WITH STILL FURTHER ADVEN- TURES IN KENSINGTON GARDENS. Daisy had kept perfectly quiet during the whole of these transactions. \" AUred\" had advanced into tho garden about a dozen steps, so that Tom was able to step be tween him and the door, and suddenly seizing him bv the back of the neck, he held him tightly. \"What? what? Help! Murder! It is not \u2014 no, it cannot be my Sophonisba !\" \" Certainly not,\" said Tom. \"Mercy! mercy! Is it Sir WilUam ? or is it some dreaded rival, with sanguinary intentions ?\" \" A Uttle of both,\" said Tom. \" Mercy ! mercy ! I give her up. I'll give j'ou all her letters, her lock of hair, the white bow and the soUcd gloves, the sprig of mig nonette, and everything else that this fond heart And r.ow that Tom thought of immediately leaving tho gardens, he made his way to the little clump of bushes near to which sho was waiting, and patted her neck. \"Bravo Daisy!\" he said; \"wo've made a pood night's work ; and I have haU a minjd to mount, and gallop off to the old gal's crib in \\V ardour Street, and see what the swag is worth.\" Tom had hardly half made up his mind to this conclusion when a low, rapping sound came at the gate. Tom was silent in a moment. Who could that be ? has cherished \u2014 only let me go in peace and com fort, and don't be violont \u2014 oh, don't !\" \" You're a pretty fellow,\" said Tom, \" to come out at night and meet a charming girl ! I only wish she heard you. But come now to business. He took Daisy by the bridle, and withdrew about half a dozen paces. Indeed, ho did not feel quite suro but it would bo tho best policy to mount and rido through the"], [179, "173 EDITH HERON. Have you any objection to a couple of slugs in your brain ?\" \" Slugs ! Gracious ! I'm a dead man !\" AUred let his legs slip from under him, and, as Tom found a difficulty in holding him up entirely by the back of his neck, he was forced to let him go ; and AUred feU in a huddled-up fashion at his conqueror's feet. Tom was puzzled to know what to do with AUred, but as ho made no attempt to escape, lus lying on the ground was about as convenient a position as any other. \" Come, now !\" said Tom, \" I can't waste all my time upon you. Have you got any money ?\" \" I ? I, money ?\" \" Yes ; surely you have some ?\" \"Why, I'm a poet!\" \"A what?\" might flow from the lips of Alfred ; but with a full conviction that Kensington Gardens would soon be, metaphorically speaking, too hot to hold him, he made his way towards Daisy. Opening again that small gate in the waU, he led out Daisy into the Bayswater Boad. But he retained the key in his possession after locking Alfred in the gardens. \" This may be useful another time,\" said Tom, as he thrust the key deep into his pocket. Tom was curious then to know what the time was, and he took out old Sir WUliam's watch from his pocket to look. But the darkness was too great to enable him to do so. Tom guessed, however, that it was some time past midnight, and he debated in his own mind what he had best do. \" A poet \u2014 and did you ever hear of a poet hav ing any money.\" \" WeU, I don't know about that,\" 6aid Tom ; \" but what business have you coming here after Sophonisba ?\" \" Gracious heavens ! you know her ?\" \" I do ; and now I come to think of it, she told me she had been in the habit for some time past of handing you little parcels of jeweUery and trinkets, so that when you and 6he eloped from old Sir William, her uncle, you might, I suppose, have something to Uve upon.\" \" Heavens above us !\" cried AUred, \" he knows aU.\" No ordinary success upon the road could pos sibly have brought him the amount of plunder he reaUy possessed ; and after due consideration of all the pros and cons ot the matter, he made up his mind at once to ride to Wardour Street and lodge his booty with Mortification and his mother. Acting upon this impulse, Tom turned Daisy's head towards London. He saw no occasion for anything in the shape of speed, and he let Daisy go at her own pace. Tyburn Gate was iu sight, and Tom was thinking of other matters, when from out a stable yard close to the market gardens that were now on his left hand, there came a horseman. \" Stand, on your life !\" shouted a voice. \" Jonathan Wild !\" cried Tom, on the impulse of the moment. \" I do ; and as I consider you quite unworthy of so pretty a girl, I mean to blow the few brains you've got out, and leave you here, in the old gardens as food for the crows, and hawks, they like pecking a bone.\" \" Spare my Use,\" said AUred, \" and take all I have. I'm a poor wretch, without a farthing ; but as Sophonisba had wealthy friends, and a good stock of jewellery, I thought that as I intended first of all to run away with her and Uve upon hor jewels and trinkets until her friends became reconcUed to us, and then I meant to Uve with, and on, them for the remainder of my life. \" That's candid, at all events,\" said Tom ; \" and now teU me where are the trinkets and jewels you've already had from her.\" \"In my \u2014 that is to say, they're at home, where it is impossible to get them.\" \" Permit me to doubt that,\" said Tom. \" I don't liko a man to begin to say a thing, and not carry it out. You said in my , and then stopped short. Now, just be so good as to go on, and tell me what you meant by that ?\" \"Nothing\u2014 oh, nothing.\" \" You won't tell me ?\" \" Stand, or I fire !\" \" Fire, and be hanged !\" cried Tom. \" You don't catch me quite so easy, Johnny !\" Bang went one of Wild's pistols. \" That'll do,\" shouted Tom. \" A miss is as good as a mUe.\" As he spoke, he turned Daisy's head again to wards the country, and gaUopped off. Wild was well mounted and on a fresh horse, to which he set spurs, and foUowed hard and fast upon Tom's track. He shouted as he came on, and Tom could just catch the words he uttered. \" I wiU foUow y\u00bb__, if it's half round the world, till I nab you.\" Now Tom Eipon knew perfectly well that on a gaUop there was no horse that Jonathan Wild could possibly procure capable of beating Daisy. But there were such things as accidents on the road. A lost shoe. \" I cannot \u2014 it is nothing.\" \" Then I will. It means ' in my pocket,' and from there they will soon be in mine. Keep quiet, or it will be worso for you.\" In spite of a partial resistance from AUred, Tom Eipon in the most scientific manner, emptied his pocket of sundry little parcels, which no doubt contained portions of the jeweUery and trinkets, mention by the deluded Sophinisba. \" That'U do,\" said Tom. \" I wouldn't have done this, but I feel that you are quite unworthy of the girl, because you are a coward and a donkey.\" Tom did not wait to hear what remonstrances An accidental stumble. The meeting of other persons coming from the contrary direction, to whom WUd might call for assistance. AU these were contingencies which Tom had to look to as against him in a long chase. And, moreover, he had no desire to get far into the country with Jonathan WUd at his heels. All these considerations induced Tom to think that under the circumstances a Uttle cunning would be better than speed. \"If I can only house myself,\" b. thought, \"for five miuutes, I am safe.\""], [180, "174 EDITH HERON. I I \"What! You Jonathan Wild? You that horrid wretch who \" \" Come, come ! don't he abusive ! I want to go into the cottage for a few seconds, and you'd better mind what you're saying and doing, or I'll burn it down to a cinder, and you in it.\" The woman fled into tho cottage 'again with a scream of dismay. \" Stoop, Daisy !\" said Tom ; \" stoop down, lass \u2014 down, and crawl in like a mouse !\" Daisy understood what Tom meant, and lower ing her head, while Tom himseU lay quite flat back on the saddle, she made her way right into the cottage by its open door. \" That'U do,\" cried Tom. \" Now get a light and take a good look at me ; and you will see I'm no more Uke Jonathan Wild than Blue Beard. Get the light quick, and take a good look at me, and fasten up the door if you can.\" So close to town as they both now were, of course many viUas and cottages presented them selves, but it was not a time of night to find any of them open, and even if they had been so, how could Tom take upon himself to say that he could trust any of their inhabitants. At all events, his policy was to place in the meantime as great a distance between himself and Jonathan Wild as possible. \" On, Daisy, on !\" he cried, after the manner in which he had heard Felix Heron so often speak to the. noble creature. Daisy flew Uke the wind. But even assuming that she could gallop three miles to two that Jonathan WUd could accom plish, it would take a long time to place anything like some mUes between them, since they had started from the Bayswater Boad almost at the same instant. As Daisy ascended a slight eminence, Wild exerted his stentorian powers of voice, and made himseU heard again. CHAPTER CCXXXVI. \" Halt, and I promise no harm shall come to you.\" \" Don't you wish you may get it ?\" said Tom. \" I fancy I would rather take care of myseU.\" \" Halt, or I fire again, and I don't miss twice.\" \" Try it !\" shouted Tom. Wild did try, and discharged his second pistol in pursuit of Tom Eipon. \" Now for it !\" said Tom. \" You've had two shots at me, and its my turn, old Johnny.\" Tom was dexterous and agUe as a harlequin, and drawing the two holster pistols from the saddle of Daisy, he fairly turned round, sitting for a few seconds with his back to Daisy's head. In this ludicrous attitude, Tom fired at Jona than Wild. TOM RIPON MEETS WITtl AN EXCITING ADVENTURE. The relation between Tom Eipon and Jonathan WUd was, as the reader is weU aware, very simi lar to that between the latter and FeUx Heron. That is to say, while WUd thought Heron was in Use. Tom had made a sort of compact with the great thief-taker that the one was not to injure the \u25a0other. There was no understanding, though, that if Tom went upon the road, WUd was not to do what Wild would have caUed his duty, and strive to apprehend him. The two pistols were discharged in such rapid euccession that, the smoke for a few seconds made the darkness about the spot doubly obscure. But it so happened that Wild had reached the top of an .eminence, and such light as still Ungered in the sky formed a background to him and his horse, against which they were tolerably clearly discernible. Tom felt a confidence in the fact that ho could on that night, U he pleased, put an end to aU difficulty with regard to Jonathan Wild. To Ue in ambush by the side of the road and shoot him would have been the readiest method of putting an end to all trouble on his account. But Tom never thought of such a thing for a moment. Tom saw him fall. He saw, though, at the same time, that he kept his hold of the bridle. To outwit WUd he would try with aU the in genuity in his power. And, possibly, if it came to close quarters, there might be, between them, an interchange of shots. The horse was dragging him along slantways across the road. \" That'll do,\" said Tom. \" I think I've hit him. He's not killed, of course, because I look upon it as a settled thing that Jonathan Wild is to be hanged, but I rather think I've stopped his Uttle career for to-night. \" Murder ! thieves ! fire !\" screamed a female voice. Chance shots, only, though. The dehberate act of lying in wait to assassi nate him, Tom would have shrunk from as down right cowardly. And such, indeed, was the usual relation, at period, between what were called the knights of the road and the poUce officers. Each lived by the exertions of tho other. The officers found their most lucrative occu pation in running after such gentry. Tom looked hastily in tho directioa from whence it came, and he saw that embowered among some trees there was a little white-washed cottage, from the door of which a woman had suddenly rushed out, in rather an alarming state of deshabille, no doubt thoroughly alarmed by the firing. \" Murder ! murder ! thieves ! watch 1\" The highwaymen felt and knew that they were tolerated by the officers, who might, any day they pleased, have made a clean sweep of the whole tribe of them. \"What's the matter?\" said Tom. It was rather a trial of wits, then, between these two apparently opposing parties, than one of lUe and death. \" 1 heard something.\" \" Whatever you heard, it's not half so bad as the noise you're making.\" \" But what was it, and who are you?\" \" Oh, I\u2014 I'm Jonathan WUd.\" Hence was it that Tom made his way into this Uttle cottage by the road-side."], [181, "175 EDITH HERON. He had no fear of Wild. \" I don't know what you're talking about,\" said But he wanted to avoid him. Tom. \"Look at me !\" be cried to the woman, again. \" Get the Ught and look at me, and don't stand equalUng there !\" The woman had had a light, but the opening and shutting of the cottage door had extin guished it. That was the period of old tinder-boxes, when, in case of any alarm, it took a good twenty minutes to procure a light. \" Stop a bit \u2014 stop a bit !\" said the woman ; \" I don't think your voice is at all like Jonathan Wlid's.\" \" I'm afraid you know too weU.\" \" I'U be hanged if I do !\" \" That lets me know that you are one of Jona than Wild's men, since you mention the fate of my poor boy Andrew.\" . \" Open, I say !\" cried WUd. \" Am I to be kept here all night? \u2014 or do you want me to break down the door ? Open the door, I say \u2014 Open !\" The woman resigned herseU to the most abject fear ; and it was almost doubtful if she under stood what Tom said, as he spoke to her in a whisper. \" I should rather think not,\" said Tom. Click, cUck went tho flint against the steel, as the woman strove to ignite the tinder which was to give her a Ught. But the tinder was obstinate. \" You're very much mistaken. I am no man of Jonathan Wild's, but trying to get out of his way. I will stay here, however; and U, as you suspect, he should try to murder you, you may make up your mind that he wiU be foUed at that.\" Or the flint had lost its flue edge. No light came, Tom thought of a trick he had often played his mother, and throwing up the pan of one of his pistols, he took a pinch of powder from it. Leaning over the shoulder of the woman of the cottage, it was an easy thing to drop that pinch of powder into the tinder-box. Fluff ! \" You wUl save me ?\" \" Hush ! Don't speak so loud. I wUl.\" Tom was glancing eagerly around tho little cottage, in the hope of seeing some hiding-place for himself and Daisy. None presented itseU in that room ; but there was a small door at the back which seemed to lead into some outhouse or scullery, and which further communicated with the front apartment by a narrow sUp of a window, filled with diamond shaped panes of glass. \" Murder !\" The tinder was thoroughly alight. \" What's the matter ?\" said Tom. \" The tinder is bewitched.\" \" Hush !\u2014 be quiet ! What's that ?\" A heavy knocking came at the cottage door. \" I'm a lost woman \u2014 I'm a lost woman ! \" Where does that go to ?\" said Tom. The woman was far too bewildered to answer him. Thieves ! \u2014 thieves !\" Tom, therefore, looked for himself ; and he was very much gratified to find that there was a mode of exit from the Uttle back scullery to a cabbage and potato-garden, no doubt reclaimed from the waste land around, since the paling that enclosed it was of the most primitive and insecure character. \" Hold your row !\" said Tom, in a whisper. \" I am not Jonathan Wild, but that is!\" \" Then, indeed, I am lost, since he comes again !\" \"Again?\" \" Yes ; and he said he would kih me !\" \"Nonsense!\" \" That'll do,\" said Tom. He led Daisy right out into the cabbage-garden ; and then, returning himself to the little scullery, he looked through the lattice-window just at tho moment when WUd, by a powerful effort, had burst the wooden latch of the cottage-door, and appeared with a pistol in each hand upon its threshold. \" He swore it ; and he's a man who will keep his word in any wickedness, although in any good it would be quite another matter.\" \" You're about right there,\" said Tom. \" But bo quick, and get a light.\" \" I cannot ; my hand shakes.\" \" Give me the match.\" Tom's nerves wero pretty weU strung ; and, notwithstanding Jonathan Wild kept banging and hammering at the door of the cottage, there was soon a smaU blue flame at the end of the brim stone match. The woman sunk to her knees, aud held up her hands imploringly. WUd stepped back one pace, as U in surprise. \"Is this possible?\" ho said. \"Do I see Mrs. Mears ?\" Tom lit the rushlight which was upon the little round table close at hand. The woman uttered a half-shriek. \"WeU, this is a slice of luck!\" added Wild. \" I was told, at the old cottage where you used to Uve, near Eating, that you had entirely disap peared ; and here I find you, by accident, as snug as possible !\" \" No, no !\" \" But I say yes, yes ; and I am quite deUghted to see you !\" WUd glanced out at the cottage door, in order, no doubt, to see that his horse was in safety, the bridle of which he had tied to a Uttle cherry-tree that grew close to the humble porch. \" All's right !\" he said. He closed the door of the cottage. \" Now, Mrs. Mears,\" he said, \" I want to ask He took one glance into the face of the woman, and he saw an expression of the most abject fear and despair upon it. \" Open ! Open !\" cried the voice of WUd from without. The woman wrung her hands. \" Open ! Open !\" \" Yes,\" she moaned; \"that ia his voice. I Know it too well ! He said he would come again, and ho is here. You are one of his men, and be tween you I am a dead woman.

He was hanged, I admit \u2014 hanged at Tybum, with all the usual formalities ; and now, as an old ac quaintance of aU parties, I'll just tell you how it happened.\" \" Wretch !\" \" I know nothing ! I cannot tell you !\" \" Don't be in such a hurry. I have not asked you yet. I am in pursuit of a fellow who is on the road to-night ; and, by theiby, that puts me in mind that he has left his mark upon me.\" WUd took off his hat and wig; for he oc casionaUy indulged in the wear of the latter ar ticle. When he did so, he exhibited what appeared to be a very serious and ghastly wound in the head. \"HUloa!\u2014 hilloa!\" In reality, though, it was but a trifle. The bullet from one of Tom's pistols had merely furrowed up the skin of the scalp, which had not bled very profusely, but stUl sufficient to give the appearance of an ugly gash. The woman of the cottage uttered a haU scream. \" Fiend !\" \"Come, come, Mrs. Mears, you are getting abusive ! This was how it took place. I told your son that U he brought me my regulars I would be as good as a father to him, and he pro mised he would do so. He did for a little while, till at last \u2014 you know as well as I \u2014 that, along with Blueskin and Q.uUt Arnold, he cracked a crib on Wandsworth Common.\" \" What are you squalUng at now ?\" cried WUd. \" Give me a basin, or a tub, with some cold water.\" \" OJi, spare me ! \u2014 spare me !\" \" We shall see about that. His share of the Mrs. Mears was in such a state of agitation, that it was with the greatest difficulty she could comply with this request of Jonathan Wild. \" A towel !\" he shouted swag was a good bagful of plate, of which he said nothing to me. I never saw any of it ; so you see, Mrs. Mears, he brought his death upon himself.\" She handed him one. He dashed the cold water over his head ; and then, soaking the towel in it, he wound it round the wound. \"Alas! alas!\" \" Ah, you may well cry that ! I told him the night before he took his ride down Holborn HiU in the cart for Tyburn, that I could stiU save him if he told me where the swag was. But he wouldn't. He said he had given it away ; but I didn't beUeve him. I do beUeve, though, that you know where it is !\" Over that, again, he placed his wig. Then he put on his hat. Wild looked a more hideous object than ever. The towel raised the wig and the hat to an unusual height, making him look at once brutal and grotesque. \"No!\u2014 no!\" \" Now, marm,\" he said, u since you appear to be up and quite lively at this time of night, just teU me if you heard a horseman pass your door, and which way he went; for I see there's a lane close by the side of your cottage.\" \" I know nothing !\" \" Oh, you know nothing ?\" \"Nothing, as I live!\" \" Nothing, as you Uve ? Ha, ha ! Perhaps that won't be for long ; for I hold that people who know nothing are not of much use in this world.\" \" Yes ! yes ! \u2014 and I don't intend to leave this cottage till I know !\" \" I cannot teU you ! Do you think that aU the silver plate in the world would have stood be tween my boy Andrew and death ?\" \" I don't know that ! It's somewhere ; and if you don't know, who is to know V\" . \" I cannot teU you. Take yourseU hence, man of many crimes ! \u2014 take yourself hence ! The judgment of heaven wiU one day overtake you, and the hour of your own death may be nearer at hand than you imagine ! Take yourself hence, I say, Jonathan WUd ! and no longer afflict one who is a mourner, and to whom even death has no terrors!\" Jonathan flung himself int. an old arm-chair as he spoke ; and looked at the shrinking and trem bling woman with a most diaboUcal expression of countenance. \" Oh, that's it, is it ? Very well, Mrs. Mears, I'm not a sort of man to stand upon haU-measures ; and since you are so independent of life, I shaU just give you the option of telUng me within the next minute and a half where the swag is, or a pistol-buUet will send you to kingdom come !\" Wild, as he spoke, faced about upon the chair, so that he sat astride upon it as though on his horse, with the back of it in front of him. On that back he balanced ono of his pistols, and presented it fuU at the unfortunate woman. \" Now decide,\" he said. \" Give me the infor mation I want, or in another minute you are a dead woman !\" He lowered his tone, and spoke in a deep, growling voice. \" Mrs. Mears \u2014 Mrs. Mears, I say !\" \" Yes \u2014 oh, yes !\" \"You recollect?\" Bhe wrung her hands and wept. \" Can I ever forget ? \u2014 can I ever forget ?\" \" WeU, I should think not !

He no doubt, in his own mind, had given up all thoughts of encountering Tom again on that night ; but now to meet him in this cottage, and to know that he had been a Ustener to the fearful conversation which had just ensued between him and the unhappy Mrs. Mears, was a most perplex ing circumstance. Daisy saw her way very much better in the dark than Tom Bipon, and she soon reached the high road again. Tom cast one glance back at the cottage, and then 6ct off at speed. \" On, Daisy, on ! \" She knew that expression weU. Fleet as the wind she carried her light rider to London. \" Blaze away, Johnny !\" cried Tom ; \" why don't you say six, and do it ?\" \"Confusion take you!\" \" Oh, dear, no, it's taken you, I think !\" \" I knew you.\" \" Who said you didn't ? It's quite of as much consequence that I know you.\" \" Tom Bipon.\" \" Johnny Wild.\" \" Be thankful that I do not turn this weapon against you ; but I have promised not to do so, and I will keep my word, on one condition.\" \" That's kind ! \" said Tom. She leaped Tyburn-gate, a feat which there were not six horses in the United Kingdom capable of. Iu an incredibly short space of time Tom drew rein at the door of his mother's house in Wardour Street. It was two o'clock in the morning, as Tom, leaning from his saddle, rapped at the upper panel of the door. There was no risk of finding the little family in Wardour Street otherwise than in a fit state to receive visitors. \" Surrender to me Daisy, the late Felix Heron's horse, and I give you a new lease of life.\" \"WeU,\" said Tom, \"that's what I call reason able and \u25a0moderate ! \" The peculiar business carried en by Mi.. Bipon was in its greatest state of activity be tween about two o'clock in the morning and day break. \" You consent ? \" cried Wild eagerly. \" Certainly. But as we aU have our little con ditional I must make one.\" \" I agree to it beforehand.\" \" Well, that saves trouble \u2014 it's a very siurple one.\" It was then that the midnight burglar came to rid himseU of his spoil, in the continued possession of which lay his chiefest danger. It was then that the highwayman, riding to London upon- his clever, serviceable hackuej, delivered at some such establishment, as Mrs. Bipon's the watches, purses, and jewels he had succeeded in appropriating on t_t__oa_u. Tom's appeal, then, to the upper panel of the otrterdsor, was a welcome sound to Mrs. Eipon and Mbrtificatioii. \"Na__eit.\" \" It's just this. You shaU have Daisy \" ' \"Yes?\" \" When you can get her ! \" Wild raised his pistol and fired at once. There was a great crash of glass in the lattice window. Mrs. Mears screamed loudly. Tom then fired. The sounds betokened the arrival of a customer. But that that customer was Tom Bipon pro bably would have been the last idea to occur to either his mother or Mortification. The cottage was full of the smoke of gun powder, and the concussion of the air had extin guished the light. WUd fell backward entangled in the choor on which he was seated in so eccentric a fashion. It was just possible, though, that some party of officers of the police, intent upon the capture of some gentleman who mistook other people's pro perty for his own, might be visiting the fences of London. Tom flung the door open thafe loi from the ecullery, and strode into the cottage. \" I'm not hit, Johnny ! \" he said. \" How have you come off ? \" Oh, there you are ! \" Jonathan Wild lay upon the floor, and Tom had good reason to suppose that at last he had done for the great thief-taker, and sent him out of the world to which he had been a vexation so long. \" Mrs. Mears ! Mrs. Mears ! \" cried Tom ; \" get another light, and let us have a look at the rascal ! \" Or it might be that some individual Bow 'Street runner was taking a round for the purpose of col lecting what he called his \" vaUs.\" Those were the perquisites \u2014 the kind of black mail which was levied upon the keepers of the fences, by the officers, for leave to cany on the nefarious trade. Therefore was it tliat a reconnoitre was always taken through some loop-hole, for the purpose of ascertaining who the visitor roally was. The affrighted woman, however, had fled, and Tom found himself alone in the darkness, with what might or might not be the dead body of Jonathan Wild. Tom Eipon knew perfectly well the existence of this loop-hole above the outer door of the fence in Wardour street. This was not a pleasant state of things, and Tom hastened to bring it to a conclusion. \" I'll be off to town,\" he said to himseU. ** This has been a pretty night of adventures for a beginning. But U I've settled Jonathan WUd, it's nobody's fault but his own.\" Tom made his way into the scullery, and then into tho cabbage garden where Daisy waited for him. PulUng his hat down upon his brow, Tom altered his voice to a gruff sound, as he cried out, \" House, here ! \u2014 house ! What do you mean by keeping a gentleman waiting hero on the thresh old ? \" Mortification had mounted the Uttle stool which enabled him to reach, with ease, the place of espiaL He mounted hastily, and left Daisy in the"], [185, "EDITH HERON. 179 Tom's assumed voice was quite strange to Wild or any of his crew for the best hundred guineas the world ever saw.\" \" Thou hast booty, Thomas ?\" \" Lots.\" him. \" Yea,\" he said, \" who art thou ?\" \" Don't you know me ?\" \"Verily, no!\" \" Then I know you !

Mortification heaved a great sigh. \"Yea, I always said thou wert a charming youth ; and verily, Thomas, I wiU open the door to thee.\" \"What?\" exclaimed Mortification, in undis guised astonishment. The door was opened instantly. \" Come in\u2014 come in ; for yea, as the Psalmist says \" \" Plague take the Psalmist!\" cried Tom. \" We shall have some of the night patrols upon us soon. What did you mean by puUing a string, and some thing coming on a fellow's head?\" \" Yea, here is the string* and thy sainted mother, Thoma_, is above. We are occasionally visited by disreputable characters, who have nothing to sell, but want some money ; and yea, this- is the mode by which we let them know they are not wel come.\" \" Because, U you can,\" added Tom, \" I've got a donkey round the corner loaded with all the swag.\" \"Young man,\" said Mortification, \"thy jokes are Ul-timed ; and as the Psalmist says, ' Go about thy business, and aUow other folks to go about theirs.' \" \" But this is business.\" \" Yea, I have but to pull a string, and tire re spectable Mrs. Eipon, who is on the floor above, will cast something down upon thy head which will make thee remember us.\" \" A capital mode, toov\" said Tom. \"Just step outside a minute, and fetch in that bundle.\" \" Bundle ?\" \" Yes, just on the threshold,\" \" Is it swag, Thomas ?\" Tom laughed. He spoke in his natural voice. \" Don't pull it then, old Mortfication, or you'U spoil Captain what's his name's red coat.\" \" Gracious powers 1\" cried Mortification, \" yea^ it is Thomas !\" \"To be snro itiiB. \" Lovely youth !\" Tho Eev.

In the surprise of the moment, Mortification stepped on one side, and feU from the stool into tbe passage. \" Yea, where are yon now ?\" said Ton*. \" Verily, I have had a fall ; but yea, here am I again!\" \" Open the door.\" \" One moment, Thomas.\" \"Well, what is it?\" \" I sincerely hope that thou hast not forgotten the wonderful principles of honesty implanted in thy young heart by the tender Mrs. Bipon that was, but Mrs. Mortification that is.\" \"Oh, bother!\" said Tom. \"But,\" pursued Mortification, thrusting his arm through the aperture above the door, and waiving it about in an oratorical fashion \u2014 \" but, Thomas, if thou hast so far forgotten those sub lime precepts as to take to thyseU the watches, the pocket-books, the purses, the rings, and other jewellery of persons unknown, yea. thou art welcome here ; and although we shaU not kill the fatted calf, we shall give the best price for swag \u2014 yea !\" \" Ah, now,\" said Tom, \" that's rather unkind.\" \"_\u00bbi?\" \" Ono can't be always lucky.\" Ton. pulled the string that had been pointed ont to him instantly.

Tom laughed immensely. \"Mulder! I am drowned!

The gallows is groaning for you!\" \" Do you mean to say,\" said Tom, \" that yon won't give a hundred guineas ?\" \"What?\" \" Oh !\" \" And you know a follow may go on the road and lose his pistols, and even his hat, as well os what little money he has in his pocket.\" \" Oh ! is that tby case, Thomas?\" \" Bather.\" \"Thou I have no hesitation in saying that thou art the most hardened, impudent, ugly ruffian I ever heard of.\" \" A hundred guineas, I say, to save me from the traps.\" \" Do I live, or am I a delusion and a snare ?

Have you gone mad ?\" Mrs. Bipon placed her finger on her Ups and shook her head. Mortification did the same. \"Not a word!\" \"No, not one !\" Tom looked from one to the other of them in undisguised amazement. \" He's coming,\" said Mrs. Bipon. \" Yea,\" said Mortification. \" From the next house.\" \"My chUd\u2014 my child !\" \" Be off, I say !

Yea.\" \" It's Sylvester, the officer. He must have tracked you, Tom.\" \"Yes, he must have tracked you, Thomas. Give him the twenty guineas, and let him run.\" \" Oh,\" said Tom, \"that's the game, is it? Ha, ha ! That's the way you manage business ! You offer a fellow one half of what he ought to have, and then try and scare him off with the grabs ; but that won't do for me ! I shaU be glad to see Sylvester, the officer, if he's up-stairs ! Hoy, Sylvester! Come down, old chap! I want to give these two people into charge for receiving stolen goods ! I'll turn King's evidence and tell you all about it!\" \" Take your money, and be off !\" said Mrs. Eipon ; \" you're an unnatural son !\" \" An unnatural son-in-law,\" said Mortification ; \" but stiU we shall be glad to see you, whenever you've got anything to dispose of.\" \" Yes,\" said Mrs. Eipon; \" and if you come to grief, I shall cry my eyes out, for I never can forget the feeUngs of a mother. There's your twenty guineas, Tom, and it's the last farthing we have got in the world, and we fully expect to be taken up and hanged, and ruined for buying these things of you at aU.\" \" What a pity,\" said Tom ; \" but I suppose it can't be helped. Just give me the bundle with my other clothes. That's all right. Come on, Daisy. What's that o'clock striking ?\" One \u2014 two \u2014 three \u2014 four struck the clock of St. Martin's Church. \" Yea,\" cried Mortification, as he stood upon a chair, and waved his long arms over them both Uke an insane windmill, \u2014 \" yea, this is affecting. Thomas, take your paternal relative-in-law's bless ing.\" \" But I'm smothered !\" cried Tom. \"Yea, never mind ; we shaU have the swag all the same.\" Tom found that the only way to extricate him self from his mother's embrace was to drop to the floor, and then crawl backwards. Tom executed this operation with his usual im petuosity, and, as a natural consequence, he upset the chair upon which the Beverend Mortification was standing. . \" Go it !\" cried Tom, as Mortification fell over upon Mrs. Eipon. \" Fight it out between you, and you both have my blessing.\" It was some few moments before peace and order was restored. \" Oh, Tom, Tom !\" said Mrs. Eipon ; \" the sight of you is Uke \u2014 Uke \" \" Manna in the wilderness,\" said Mortification. \" None of your abuse,\" cried Mrs. Eipon, \" but let us proceed to business.\" Tom, with a pardonable ostentation under the circumstances, laid-out his booty upon the table, which was in the centre of the room. Mrs. Eipon and Mortification took a rapid sur vey of it, and then glanced at each other. \" Twenty guineas' worth, as I'm a sinner !\" jaid Mrs. Eipon. \"Yea,\" said Mortification. \" Good !\" said Tom. \u25a0 I shaU get to the stables of Whitcombe House in capital time, and have a fine snooze before morning in the stable along with Daisy. Good night, old gal !\" Good night, Corruption !\" Tom, with the bridle of Daisy over bis arm, moved towards the outer door, and then, turning suddenly, as if struck with an alarm, he said, \" Hush !\" Then, to Tom's intense surprise \u2014 for he was aot yet half up to the tricks of receivers of stolen property\u2014 a small orifice opened in the centre of .he table, and the purses, the watches, the Uttle parcel of jewellery, and the rings, all shot down this hole as though they had been endowed with We. The little trap in the table then closed, and Mortification and Mrs. Bipon both looked up at I he ceiling, as though they saw something there peculiarly interesting. Tom looked under the table. Mrs. Bipon and Mortification ran against each other. \" Whist !\" said Tom. \" Gracious powers !\" said Mrs. Bipon ; \" what is it ?\" It was a round one, with an unusually thick, straight pillar in the centre. \" Well,\" he said, u this is a queer start.\" u Twenty guineas !\" said Mrs. Bipon. \" Yea, twenty!\" added Mortification. \" But you don't mean to say, both of you, that all that swag's only worth twenty guineas ?\" \" Hush !\" said Mrs. Eipon. Tom placed his finger on his lips, and nodded mysteriously. He let go the bridle of Daisy, and beckoned them both back to the parlour behind the shop. \" The chimney !\" said Tom. \" The what ?\" \" The chimney ! I'm sure of it ! I'd stake my life on it !\""], [187, "181 EDITH HERON. \"What\u2014 what?\" He was determined to save her. \" It wants sweeping, and now it's done.\" Tom had adroitly taken the two holster pistols from Daisy's saddle; and, as he spoke, he fired them both up the chimney of the back parlour. Being fuUy aware of what would be the effect, Tom was able to beat a hasty retreat, and catching Daisy hurriedly by the bridle, he dashed out into Wardour Street, leaving Mortification and his mother amid such an avalanche of soot, that they might as weU, actuaUy, have taken up their abode in the flue. It will be recollected that the man Q,uiver, who had been taken prisoner by Heron, and then pre tended to be so very contrite, had stated that the attempt was to be renewed on the night after the next succeeding that on which it had faUed. And Heron had had his suspicions aroused that this pretended arrangement was for the express purpose of throwing him off his guard. Mrs. Ogle's account of how this man had met one of his associates, and gone with him to one of the thieves' houses which then infested the wharfs about Hungerford, increased this sus picion. Heron determined not to let that night pass away without action. He had reaUy communicated aU that had passed to Edith, and her opinion was strongly expressed in favour of losing no time. \" Go, FeUx,\" she said ; \" perform this act of mercy and consideration, and I shall stiU further beUeve that your destiny, in the hands of Provi dence, is to succour distress and protect the in nocent!\" In a quarter of an hour more, Tom was fast asleep in the stables of Whitcombe House. CHAPTEB CCXXXVIII. FELIX HERON DETERMINES TO RESCUE AND PROTECT THE ARTIFICIAL FLOWER MAKER. While Tom Bipon was thus engaged in seeking adventures on his own account, FeUx Heron, Earl of Whitcombe, stUl continued to reside at Whit combe House, in his accustomed character of Captain Fantome, of the royal navy, who had mai Tied the Countess of Whitcombe. \" I will do my best,\" said Heron. He smiled as he spoke. \" I shaU have a debtor and creditor account with that providence you speak of, Edith ; and my misdeeds on the road, when I held command in Epping Eorest, may perhaps be blotted out by some of these transactions in which I foil viUany and profligacy in their worst aspects.\" The night came. Or rather the evening, dim and dark, with a cloudy sky. Heron wrapped a cloak about him, which con cealed the trusty sword he wore. That this disguise of Heron's had been com plete, and was likely to answer aU its purpose, was sufficiently exemplified by the fact that it eluded the vigUance even of Jonathan WUd. But, as we have more than once intimated, no disguise that Heron could possibly have assumed would have been sufficient to screen him from the hawk-like glance of Wild, but from one fact. That was the thorough conviction on the part of the thief-taker that Felix Heron was no more. Edith foUowed him down the grand staircase of Whitcombe House. There lay the safety of the whole proceeding. If once, by any accident, Jonathan should be come aware that the supposed death of Felix Heron were a delusion, there would be an end to all secrecy on the subject. She clung to him for a moment in the haU. She was evidently suffering from some emo tion. \" Even now, Edith,\" he said, \" you have some thing to say.\" \"I have \u2014 I have !\" He would naturally look to Whitcombe House to discover its master. \" And is it possible that you shrink to utter it?\" Five minutes' investigation, then, would con vince him that that master was to be found in Captain Fantome, so caUed. \" I do, FeUx ; but yet it must be uttered before you leave this house.\" \" Am I, then, so undeserving your confidence that you hesitate ?\" \" No, FeUx ; but what I am about to say is neither right nor just.\" But, with the sort of feehng that WUd had for FeUx Heron, it did not foUow that there would be any absolute danger, so far as ho was con cerned, in trusting him with the secret. But it was necessary to keep it, for other reasons. \" Is that possible ?\" \"It is true.\" Those reasons have been hinted at by the Earl of Bridgewater. \"Then, my Edith, indeed, shows herself in a new character.\" The enemies of FeUx Heron would seek his attainder, and so deprive his infant son of his in heritance. Edith stiU hesitated ; and _\u00a3n it was in a tone strugghng with an amount of feeling that almost deprived her of the power of utterance, that she spoke. Such was the reason, then, which actuated Heron in the preservation of his disguise. His activity both of mind and body, however, was such that, although he had abandoned the road for a fortnight, which gave Tom Eipon the unexpected opportunity of mounting Daisy, and seeking adventures on his 'own account, he, Heron was weU pleased that chance or providence had permitted him to interpose for the protection of that young girl who was sought to be kid napped in the streets ol London. \"AU men, Felix,\" said Edith, \"stand or fall by their actions without favour or affection, but in this affair my brother John is concerned.\" FeUx interrupted her at once. \"And can you imagine, Edith, that I am un mindful of that fact ? I wUl foil John Tarleton and his infamous employers, but it will be by accident if a single hair of his head is injured by any act of mine; and now fareweU! Best in peace Edith, and rely on me !\""], [188, "EDITH HERON. 182 During that five minutes Heron had made a determination. It was to return the signal. He did so faintly, as though he were desu-ous of using extreme caution. Heron left the house ; and taking his way to wards the narrow, gloomy street where the young and beautiful artificial flower-maker worked, he kept carefully in the shadow of the houses and looked narrowly about him. The street was anything but a populous one for passing passengers. _ The few Uttle gloomy shops that were in it had only been extemporized out of the parlour windows of the houses ; and as the street led to nowhere in particular, and was no very short cut to anybody's destination, sometimes a quarter of an hour would elapse -without the footfaU of a passenger awakening its dreary echoes. It was quite deserted when Heron reached it. The little shop in which he had taken refuge on the former occasion was closed. But three miserable oU lamps Ut the whole of the thoroughfare. One was at each end of the street, the other about midway between them. The man with the roquelaire cloak started at the sound; and, after listening for a few seconds to assure himseU from which direction it eame, he walked hastily towards the doorway in which Felix Heron was concealed. And now Heron stood sufficiently forward to let himseU be seen faintly. \" Is that you, Quiver ?\" Heron had heard Quiver speak often enough to be able to imitate his voice. \" Yes,\" he said ; \" and that's you, Eufus ?\" \" To be sure it is. But what are you stuck there for ?\" \" I thought I was to wait.\" \" Nonsense ! Come on ! The coach wiU be here directly. I only wonder it's so late as it is. The girl may come out and go home, and all our trouble to-night wUl be for nothing.\" \" Come here,\" said Heron. \"What is it?\" \" I have something particular to say to you.\" Bufus stepped on to the doorstep ; and, at the same moment, Heron grasped him by the throat with one of those terrible, vice-like pressures which were at once sufficient to convince any one subjected to them that escape was out of the question. And the Ught they shed about them was of that gloomy, dubious description that only might be said to confuse the darkness, and render it more perplexing. Heron stepped into a doorway, and looked warily about him. He began almost to suspect that Quiver was right, and that no attempt would be made until the foUowing night to can-y off the fair young creature, whose beauty seemed to be the most perilous gUt she could possess. But Heron was not left for many moments to \u2022speculate upon this idea. \"VUlain!\" said Heron. \"Help! Murder!\" Heron shook him to and fro. He heard a footfall in the street. Shrinking closer into his hiding place, Heron let this person pass the doorway, and only saw that he was a tallish man, wearing a hat with a peculiarly broad brim, and a roquelaire cloak, with a eollar of fur of rather a noticeable cha- \" Another word, and you are a dead man !\" \"What? \u2014 what? Who?\u2014 who? Have mercy upon me !\" \" Dare you ask for mercy, engaged as you are in this infamous transaction? You are worse than your employers; for, poor as the excuse may be, they can, at least, say that they are se duced by human passion and fraUty.\" This remark was, probably, thrown away upon Mr. Eufus, who only felt that he was in a dau gerous position, and that somebody had hold of him who was highly qualified to keep that hold. racter. He might be only a chance passenger in the street. But still there was a something about the lounging manner in which he proceeded which forbade that idea. After he had passed the doorway, Heron stepped out a pace on to the step, and although stiU shrouded from observation himseU, by the iron raiUng \u00abf the area, he managed to keep the man in view. \" Come this way,\" said Heron. \" Where to ?\" gasped Eufus. \"That is my business just now; for you are at my mercy. Either accompany me quietly, or I wiU fling yeu over the area rails here, and leave you to your fate !\" \"Mercy! Don't do that !\" \" Come on, then.\" Heron knew perfectly weU that two streets off there was a watch-house, or Bound-house, as they were then caUed, belonging to the parish of St. Under the lamp, which was in the middle of the street, this man paused. He either made the sound with his own lips, or with an artificial whistle, but three times he pro duced a rather faint but sufficiently shriU sound to be easily heard by any one listening for it. This was conclusive. FeUx Heron felt quite certain, now, that an attempt would be made on that night to carry out the viUanous project. Situated as the man was within the sphere of the oil lamp, Heron could just manage to take in the outlines of his figure. Ann's, Soho. Not wishing to take this man's Use, and yet feeUng the necessity of disposing of him for the remainder of the night, Heron thought that it would be a good plan to give him in charge, on some fictitious grounds, so as to ensure his being locked up untU the moi-ning. It would not take many seconds to do this. StiU holding Bufus by the throat, Heron con ducted him with rapidity to the door of the Eound house. It was not Quiver. But it bore a striking resemblance to the other man, named Kufus, who was Ids companion in iniquity. No answer came to the whistling sounds. Eufus, if it wero he, paused for about five minutes, aud then whistled again. Without giving him any explanation, then, of"], [189, "183 EDITH HERON. sententious remark of the night constable, most probably in reply U- some remonstrance from Mr. Bufus. \"Ha marltis who stands five guineas to drink can't do what he likes I should like to know who can.?\" why he did so, Heron took off his hat and roque laire cloak, and put them both on himseU. Ho then tapped at the Bound-house door. \" Hilloa !\" cried a voice from within. \" Is that you, Barnev s Have you brought the purl ?\" Heron tapped again. A small -wicket in the upper portion of the door was angrily opened. One of the night watch, with a nightcap, early as it was in the evening, drawn down over bis ears, thrust out his head. \" What is it ? What do you want here ?\" \"I am the Marquis of Hastings, aud I wish to give this man into custody for robbery.\" The magic of a title never fails of its effect in England. The Bound-house door was flung ostentatiously open, and the night watch crowded one upon another, to get sight of a real, Uve nobleman. \" Certainly, your hononr's worship. Certainly, my lord, we'll take care of the rascal.\" \" But I've done nothing,\" said Eufus. \"The viUain!\" cried all the watch in chorus. \"He dares to say he's done nothing, when he's given in charge by a real marki-i.\" Heron drew himseU up to his fuU height, aud in commanding tones spoke. \" It does not suit me, as a nobleman in close attendance upon his Majesty, to say what this rascal has done.\" CHAPTEB CCXXXIX. FELIX .RBRON PERMITS THE CAPTURE OF THK ARTIFICIAL FLOWER MAKER. <7 Heron made the best of his way back to the bye street where the young girl was to be attacked by her bitter foes. The manner of the disposal of Mr. Bufus has naturaUy taken much time in the telling ; but in reality the whole affair was transacted and con cluded within seven or eight minutes of the period when FeUx Heron first grasped him by the throat on the dim aud dusky doorstep of the bye street. But the heart of FeUx Heron beat rapidly as he turned into that street and saw that a coach was in it. He feared he was too late. Yet the coach was stationary, and he had hardly taken six paces down the pavement when from a doorway out darted a man and caught him by the arm. \" Certainly not, my lord \u2014 certainly not, my lord!\" \" But I desire he be kept in close custody.\" \" We'U knock him down, my lord, and then take liim up.\" \" There is no occasion ; aU you have to do is to place him in one of your most secure cells, and there leave him.\" \" A pretty feUow you are, Eufus, to be sa late !\" It was Quiver who spoke. \" Am I late ?\" said Heron. \"Yes, to be sure you are; and you were to have been here first!\" \" We wUl \u2014 we will, my lord. Come on, you villain !\" \" Well, I'm here now !\" \" Here now ! Of course you are. But what dm you mean by it ? Am I to do aU the work, be sides having aU the trouble and bother of deceiv ing that fellow at Whitcombe House, and making him think I'm a sort of saint, only gone astray a Uttle ?\" \" But I protest !\" cried Bufus. _ He protests !\" shouted the night constable on duty. \" The villain protests againt a marltis /\" \" Of course I do. What have I done ? What's the charge ?\" Kufus was getting bold, now that he found himself surrounded by the watch. \"Knock him down, Dennis !\" cried the night constable. \"Ah, yes!\" said Heron. \" Come on \u2014 we expect the girl out every minute.\" \" AU right !\" \" Yes, all right ! if I hadn't been as clever as I am, it would have been all wrong ; and that gentleman \u2014 for he is a gentleman, and no mis take \u2014 who nabbed me, and walked me off to au iron room in Wbitcouibe House, would have been about our ears ; and I can tell you we should have had just about as much chance with him I haU a dozen mice with a tom-cat dropped among them.\" \" There you go !\" said Denis. \" Be jabers, my illegant darlint, there you goes !\" Dennis, with his lantern, struck Eufus such a crack on the top of the head, that he certainly knocked him down, and demolished the lantern by the same operation. \" That wUl do,\" said the night constable. \" The charge now is for obstructing Dennis, one of the watch, in the execution of his duty, and breaking one lantern, the property of the paiish of St. Ann's, Soho.\" \" Exactly,\" said Heron ; \" that will do capitaUy. Look him up, aud be sure you keep him securely till the morning ; and here are five guineas to drink the health of the Marquis of Hastings.\" \" Hurrah ! Hurrah ! Hurrah ! Long life to \" But how did you manage?\" \" I told you.\" \" Oh, did you ?\" \" Why, what the deuce are you at ? Didn't I tell you I'd put him off tiU to-morrow night? and then it wUl be just four-and-twenty hours too late, for this little baby-faced chit of a giri that his Grace is so fond of wUl be in suug quar ters by that time.\" \" Oh, yes, his Grace \u2014 you mean the Duke of\u2014 of \" your Majesty !\" Heron hastily left the Bound-house, with a fuU conviction that Mr. Kufus was comfortably disposed of, most probably for the next four-and twenty hours. As he crossed its threshold, he heard the \"No, I don't. I wish I did. I heard hia called your Grace, but that's aU. However, ol{"], [190, "184 EDITH HERON. Bufus, if you and I can only find out, who he is, we shaU make a better thing of it than now. That Deuce Ace and Lord Warringdale know weU enough, and of course they are well paid.\" \" Oh, no doubt \u2014 no doubt.\" \" WeU, now, come on. You see the coach ?\" \" Yes \u2014 who is on the box ?\" But events were hurrying on, and there waB scarcely time even for these few reflections to pass through the mind of FeUx Heron. Quiver had left him, and taken up the post he had indicated. Peering from the coach window, Felix Heron saw the saturnine-looking countenance of his half brother, Lord Warringdale. \" Deuce Ace.\" \" And where is Warringdale?\" And from the coach-box there leant forward, in an unmistakable attitude of apprehension, as well as of interest, John Tarleton. That man, of all others, who was ever regarded with a shuder by Felix Heron. In him, he saw the person who in all the world he looked upon with special feelings of horror and dislike. \" Inside.\" \" Oh, that's it !\" \"Yes, but he'U come out and lend us a helping hand. We're not haU a dozen doors from the house now, so I'll run on to the end of the street and seem to be coming one way, while you come the other. You can nab her then, U she runs your way, and I'll do the business if she comes my way.\" \" Of course \u2014 of course,\" said Heron. \" But I say, Quiver?\" \"WeU, what now?\" \"What a pair of rascals we are !\" \" What of that ? We get well paid, and we always were a pair of rascals, U we come to that.\" The murderer of his father. The assassin who had deprived the late Earl of Whitcombe of the few precious years that might have remained to him of peace and repentance in this world. Heron's hand involuntarily sought the hUt of his sword, and it required all his recoUection of the sacred promise he had made to Edith to keep him from drawing his sword from its scabbard, and at once sacrificing John Tarleton to the memory of his murdered father. \" True ! Eun on \u2014 run on, and depend upon me to do my part of the work.\" Quiver ran on, although Felix Heron was very loath to let him go after the treachery that had characterized his conduct. But he restrained the impulse. Lord Warringdale spoke. It was but a word. The coach was drawn up close to the kerb stone of the pavement, about the distance of two houses from that where, in consequence of pre vious observation, it was known the young arti ficial flower-maker worked. \"Now!\" That was the word spoken. It indicated that the period of action had arrived. The door of the house in which the young artificial flower-maker worked, opened. The young girl herseU stood upon the thresh old. The conspiracy was complete in its detaUs, and but for the presence of Heron, the young girl must have faUen into the toils which were laid for her destruction. She was perfectly unconscious of danger. The sort of half attempt that had been made on the day previous at her capture, was so confused and uncertain, that it had- scarcely had given her an alarm. Bapidly, however, various ideas passed through the mind of Heron in regard to this transaction. The painful one of those ideas was this. Would it not be far better that this young girl should be put to some trifling inconvenience \u2014 he, Heron, being always at hand to protect her \u2014 than that the attempt to abduct her should altogether be frustrated, providing that trifling inconvenience had the effect of enabling him, Heron, to discover who the \" Grace \" was who was at the bottom of the whole transaction ? The possibihty or probabUity of any one attempting to seize her in the streets of London had never entered her imagination ; and although she could not but be aware that some sort of scuffle had taken place around and about her on the previous occasion, yet she by no means associated that with an attempt to take her pri soner. But stiU FeUx Heron hesitated beforo he could make up his mind to such a course as this. It was one that might entail suffering, although in a limited degree, upon the young girl ho wished to save. She turned and closed the door after her. It took two efforts to do it, for the lock was rough and rusty. Then, as she turned her face towards the open street, and as a faint gleam from the oil lamp fell upon it, Felix Heroa could not but teU himself that she was radiantly beautiful. She was one whose affection might well have been sought fairly and legitimately by the noblest or proudest, but the nefarious attempt that was about to be made for her destruction was as villan ous as Heron was determined it should be futile. It might be productive of tho most intense anxiety at her home. These were considerations which had their full weight with FeUx Heron, and he would have given much for a few minutes' conversation with that young girl, in order not only to warn her of her danger, but to suggest to her the expediency of the course he thought of pursuing. What he would have liked to say to her was just this. \" WUl you, with a consciousness that a pro tecting arm is over you, put up with some tempo rary inconvenience ?\" He had a kind of assurance upon his own mind that the reply would be in the affirmative. A .light smile wavered upon the Ups of the young girl. Perhaps she was weU pleased that her day's toU was over. Perhaps she was thinking of her home. Or it might be that the sunUght of some affec tion warmed her young heart, and in memory she was lookiug upon the face of a loved ono."], [191, "EDITH HERON. 185 The 6mile, however, was extremely sweet and gentle ; and all unconscious of danger, she stepped forward on to the pavement, and within a very few paces of her foes. Unconscious of her peril. Unconscious, too, of the protecting influence that was about her. Heron was a few paces behind her, and could weU see by the rate of progression of all parties that the encounter would take place nearly opposite the coach dour. He was still undetermined what to do. He longed for a few seconds' conversation with the girl, which would have decided him at once one way or the other. And he had now but those few seconds for re flection- Had the coach been close to the door, she might have taken an alarm; but its distance, although short from the house she had just quitted, did not in any way associate it with her or with that establishment. He came to a decision, but it was a kind of compromise of the question. \"Now !\" said Lord Warringdale again. The word was evidently addressed to FeUx Heron, who no doubt he fully believed to be the man Bufus. He made up his mind that she should be taken into the coach, and that he would enter it like wise, and ascertain from her if the result of her absence from home for another hour would be ef consequence or not, she being assured aU that time that she was in perfect safety. But there was one difficulty. Lord Warringdale was in the coacli. Heron stopped forward. Quiver had turned at the end of the street, and was now, in a slow., sauntering kind of manner, approaching the girl so as to meet her. No. 76. \u2014 Edith."], [192, "186 EBITH HERON. He must be removed at all hazards ; and Heron took the opportunity of tho few seconds stiU to .pare to dart to the coach window and -whisper, \"My lord, you are known; I've had private information youll be hunted to death.\" \"Ah!\" cried Warringdale, in undisguised ac cents of alarm. back again ; and she uttered two slirieks, which Heron could not suppress. \" Peace ! peace ! I implore you !\" he said. \"_Listen to me as calmly as you can ; and I wUl, in a few -words, inform you of the meaning of aU this, and at the same time convince you of yonr own absolute safety.\" \"No, no!\" \" Let me say yes ! I aim a gentleman \u2014 a noble man of unstained honour ! My Use for your safety ! Nothing but my absolute destruction can pave the way for injury to a single hair of those tresses which have awakened unholy wishes in the hearUof the destroyer !\" Thetones of Heron were eminently calculated to soothe the alarm of the young girl; and, although her -tears flowed, and she uttered sup pressed sobs, she was comparatively sUent. The coach rumbled on. \" It is certain!\" \" Your name ia Bufus ?\" \" Just so, my lord. Leave it to me, and TU bring the girl in safety to you know where !\" \" Certainly.\" \" G-et out at the other side, my lord.\" The fears of Warringdale were aU painfully awakened. Putting his hand out at the coach window on the side next the road, he hastily turned the door handle, and sprung out. \" Stop, stop !\" said John Tarleton ; \" don't leave me !\" \" AU's right !\" said Warringdale. liBesert your post at your peril!\" Heron had just time to effect this arrangement, and then to make his way back to the pavement, as a sharp, shrill cry broke upon his ears. It was 'the: first alarm of the young girl, upon finding, her-pr ogress arrested by Quiver. He had reached her, and seized her by the arm. CH5TTEB CCXL. HERON -ACCOMPANIES AMELIA TO THE HOUSE IN PALL MALL. A coNFUSED-bumfing noise on the roof of the vehicle convinced tHeron that Quiver was scram bUng over it from behind, to enjoy a conversation \u2022with John Tarleton on the coach-hex. \" Now, Eufus !\" he cried ; \" quick ! quick !\" \" Here !\" said Heron. \"Help! help!\" cried the young girL \"What is it ? Whatdoes it mean ?\" The distance wa3 so short from the scene of the abduction to the house in PaU Mall, that Heron felt it necessary to compress into the smaUest pos sible space what he had to say. He thought it far better to teU the girl, plainly and clearly, what was the meaning of the whole transaction, than to leave her imagination to sng gest a thousand doubts-and fears. \" There are men in London,\" he said. \u2014 \"men of wealth, rank, and influence, who, when they see a fair girl like yourseU, whose beauty and in nocence attract them \u2014 for innocence is in itseU a charm even to theamost depraved hearts \u2014 wiU seek any means of being enabled to whisper the fact of their odious passion in their ears.\" \" Oh, kflljne \u2014 kill me ! Bather kiU me !\" said the girl. Felix Heron, having' .made up his mind to a certain course, felt that the truest policy was to carry it out quickly. He flung .an arm round the slender waist of the girL and tuking advantage of his unusual height, he lifted her with ease from the pave ment. \" Bravo V cried Quiver. Heron did not speak, but in three strides reached the caaeh door. He sprung invTnih his .astonished and terrified burden. \" Drive on, Deuce Ace!\" he oried. \"Confound you!\" muttered John Tarleton; \" why do you name me ?\" The girl uttered a shrill scream. \"Peace !\" muttered Heron. \"You are as safe as though in heaven !\" \" Hush ! Again and again let me tell you that you are perfectly safe. A plan was laid to seize you in the street, and convey you to a house in Pall Mall, where you would have been without help, and where mercy is unknown. That plan came to my ears, and I 'determined to frustrate it.\" It was probably the tone of gentleness and kindness which had more effect upon hor than the words. She was silent, although she trembled exces sively. \" But I am here \u2014 I am seized \u2014 I am carried off!\" Heron closed the coach door himseU; and Quiver, with no doubt a fuU conviction ou his own mind that Lord Warringdale was within the vehicle, scrambled up behind. \" To appearance \u2014 yes ; but you shall go no further than to the end of this street, except with your own fair and free wiU.\" \" Oh, let me go now !\" \"In one moment. Hear me first, however, John Tarleton was in a fright. The evasion of Warringdale, and the sudden capture of the girl, had all happened so quickly, that his faculties were rather confused. before you make your irrevocable decision. You are not the only fair young innocent girl who wUl be expostnd to this daring outrage. You yourself are & '\u2022} for I am prepared to see you in safety to JS jr own home ; but U you would save others who, unUke you, may fall into the hands of the destroyer with no protecting arm near, you will hesitate before you reject the pro position I make to you.\" It was just as much as h\u00bb eould do to feel con scious that now he ought to drive off at once to that dreary house close to St. James's Palace where his \" Grace\" by courtesy, but not by nature, contemplated so much wickedness. Tho coach moved off. At its first motion, the alarm of the girl came"], [193, "EDITH HERON 187 I \" What proposition ?' asked the girl, timidly. \"These people who have seized you believo tne to be one of their number, because I pei f.oissit. one whom I have disposed of for tl e present. What I want you to do, then, is simply this. Suffer yourself to be taken where ever they please, I of course accompanying you and assuring you of safety ; the object being to discover who is the prime mover in these tran sactions, and so, by fears of exposure or more active measures, put an end to them at once and for ever.\" no doubt, his \" Grace\" was waiting the result of the villany. Heron whispered te the girl. \"Seem to be reluctant, and call faintly for help ; but, trust me, aU is well !\" The coach door was opened. \" This way, quick !\" said a voice. \" Is she there ?\" said another. \" Here,\" repUed Heron. \" Bring her in \u2014 bring her in ! Is it you, Bufus ?\" \" Yes.\" The girl hesitated. \" Do not say no,\" added Heron ; \" but feehng that you yourself are safe, join with me in the pro tection of many an unknown and innocent girl, who may else fall a victim when there is no one to stretch out a hand to save her.\" Heron again flung his arm round the young girl, and carried her into the house. The outer door was instantly slammed shut. A faint Ught was at the further end of the pas sage, and as Heron looked at it he saw it slowly ascending as its bearer went up some staircase in that direction. \" I wiU.\" \" That is brave ! You trust me ?\" \"FoUow him!\" said a voice; \"foUow the Ught ! Has the girl fainted ?\" \" Help \u2014 oh, help !\" said AmeUa. \" No !\" repUed Heron. \" AU's weU !\" He strode forward, following the Ught; and reaching the landing on the first floor, he passed into a spacious apartment, which was dimly Ulu minated by a few of the wax-lights in a chan delier, which carried in reality about forty, being lit. \" I do\u2014 I will.\" \" Your name ?\" \" AmeUa Travers.\" \" You have parents, brothers, sisters, and dear friends ?\" \" Alas' ! no, I am alone in all the world. There is no one to expect me \u2014 no one to maum for me \u2014 no one to \" The girl paused. FeUx Heron felt perfectly conscious that she could not say there was no one to love her. But that was not a subject upon which he wished to converse at so critical a moment. Even by that faint light it was quite possible to see that the room was gorgeously furnished. Silken hangings, mirrors, rich velvet carpeting, and a profusion of gUding in aU directions, testi fied to the costly character of the apartment. Heron glanced about him, and was somewhat surprised to see that he and the young girl were alone. He wished rather to say something more that would give her confidence ; and although he could not entrust her with his real name and rank, he said, \" It is proper that I should return your confi dence by telUng you that I reside in St. James's Street. I am the husband of the Countess of Whitcombe, who is weU aware of my proceedings this night, and of the determination I made, not only to rescue you, but to ask you to be the means of rescuing others, whom I might not bo so fortunate to be able to save as I have you.\" \" If you are the husband of the Countess of Whitcombe,\" said the girl, \" you should be the Earl of Whitcombe.\" The person who had preceded him with the Ught had certainly gene into that room, but appa rently had found some means of leaving it by another door. Heron then was about to speak to AmeUa, when he was startled by a voice, from whence he knew not, saying, \" It is done ! Leave the saloon, and lock the door on the outer side !\" AmeUa clung to Henon, \" No, no !\" she whispered; \" not for worlds ! I cannot stay here alone ! You premised to pro tect me ! Stay with me \u2014 stay !\" \" I wiU come back instantly.\" \"On your word ? In the name of heaven, you promise me?\" \" I da, in the name of heaven !\" It was a hazardous expedient that suggested itseU to Heron, but he seated the young girl on a large settee, the crimson silk back of which was unusuaUy large ; he then strode to the door, and opening it suddenly, dashed it shut again, at the same moment sinking quite to the floor, so that if even any casual observation were directed to wards him, it would appear that he was gone. The sort of twitight in which the room was, favoured a man\u0153uvre of this kind, U boldly and This was a shrewd guess, and but that on principle Heron could not entrust her with the secret of his existence, he would have at once assented to the proposition. \" We wiU talk further on that subject with the Countess herseU,\" he said. \" All that I want you to feel is that you are now absolutely safe. I am armed, and weU able to use those arms ; and I do not believe there is any power that can be arrayed against you with which I shaU not be able fully to cope.\" \" I trust you, sir.\" \"Freely and implicitly?\" \" I do so, indeed ; and it is not so much from what you say, as from tho way in which you say it. And now that this thing has happened, I cau think back, and understand' that it has been at tempted more than once before.\" \" There can bo no doubt about that.\" rapidly executed. It was successful. No notice was taken of Heron's presence, and the room was so fuU of miscellaneous articles of costly furniture, that he had no difficulty in crawling successfuUy along the floor to the back of the settee, on which was Amelia. \" I am here,\" he said. As Heron uttered these words the coach stopped. He glanced from the window, and saw that they wore at the door of the house where the wicked project had been concocted, and where,"], [194, "EDITH HERON. 188 That passage was in perfect darkness, and he only saw its extent by the faint gleam of light that uhone into it from the room ho quitted. But he felt he was on the right track. \" Thank heaven !\" \" Be at peace, for all is well.\" \" But what will happen ?\" \" I know not ; but you are safe. I wiU not leave you again beyond the width of this room.\" The stUlness in the house was something re markable, and Heron could not divest his mind from a certain feehng of superstition in regard to the whole affair. The murmur of conversation came more fully upon his ears. He followed the mysterious passage for a con siderable distance, feeUng the walls carefuUy on each side in the hope of finding some door that might lead from it to the room where the myste rious persons were conversing. At length he felt confident that he had passed the confines of that apartment, for the murmurs of the voices began to die away. Heron retraced his steps in perplexity. Once more he reached the door of the room he had recently left ; and glancing into it, ho still saw Amelia on the settee, with that bright and glistening sword in her hand. It seemed to him so unreal and so absolutely strange, that he would scarcely have been sur prised suddenly to have awakened, and find it but a dream. This 6tate of affairs, however, lasted but a very few minutes. A faint confused murmuring sound, as of con versation taking place between several persons, came upon the ears of Heron and AmeUa. After Ustening attentively for some few minutes, Heron was able to localise those sounds, so to speak, and to feel convinced that they came from a room adjoining the further end of the magni ficent apartment in which he was. \" Amelia ! \" She evidently saw him, for she made a slight movement of the sword blade. And Heron waved his hand to her to give her assurance that all was weU. \" Yes\u2014 yes?\" \" Do you hear those sounds, and wiU you per mit me to cross the room in order to Usten to them more closely ? \" He then resumed his search in the narrow passage, and this time it was not without a re sult. He had felt before that the walls were covered with a rough kind of cloth, but now he acci dentally placed his hand upon a portion of it which was loose and limp to the touch. That portion of the cloth formed a kind of curtain over a small window composed of but one pane of glass. The moment he removed the curtain, a broad but faint gleam of artificial light came through the glass into the passage. The girl hesitated. Nervously she clung to the sleeve of Heron's coat, and he could feel that she trembled with a thousand undefined apprehensions. \" You are a brave girL AmeUa,\" he said, \" and I feel confident you can protect yourself ; as con fident, indeed, as that I feel there is no one in this house unfriendly to you, who can boast of a real spark of courage. Take my sword \u2014 hold it firmly by the hilt, and scruple not to use it freely if necessary, whUe I go and \\_sten to these sounds.\" Heron shrunk back; for the natural idea at the moment was that he must of necessity be seen. Amelia took the sword trembUngly ; but there must have been an innate spirit of chivalry and courage about her, to induce her to take it at all. A few seconds' reflection, however, dissipated this notion. He was in darkness in the passage, and the room was lighted. Looking, therefore, from the shadowy ob scurity of where he was into the partially illu minated apartment, it was impossible he could bo seeH, while, so far as tho amount of light would permit him, he might, with ease, be a spectator of everything and everybody that was on the other side of the pane of glass. It was a singular scene that met his gaze. The room seemed to be a perfectly square one , and in tho middle of the floor was a table covered with a heavy cloth of green velvet. FeUx Heron at once crossed the apartment towards a door, the upper panels of which were of looking-glass. He felt confident that in that direction he was to look for the persons, the murmuring sound of whose conversation had come so plainly upon his ears. The door yielded to his touch, but before he passed through it, he looked back, and through the twilight obscurity of the room, he saw Amelia. She sat Uke some beautiful statue upon tliat settee, with a drawn sword in her hand. The faint light from the wax candles shone upon the glittering blade. That again sent a reflection upon the face of the young girl. Felix Heron thought he had never seen any one look so truly beautiful. He would fain have spoken to her. He would fain have said one word for the purpose of assuring her that all was safe, and that she was still watched over by a hand and heart that would not fail her. Around that table sat eleven persons. One chair was vacant; and on the table imme diately in front of it lay an embroidered pocket handkerchief and a snuffbox, so richly set with jewels, that they kept shooting forth rays of prismatic light in the most beautiful profusion. Hardly had Heron time to reckon the number of these persons, and take a glance round the mysterious apartment, when a door opened at tho further end of the room, and an individual en tered, at whose appearance the eleven poisons who were sitting round tho table immediately rose. But it would not have been prudent to do so, and leaving that word unspoken, ho passed out of tho gorgeous apartment into a narrow passage. Tho new comer bowed with something Uke hauteur, and then took his place on that twelfth chair which had evidently been reserved f\u00bbr him."], [195, "189 EDITH HERON. Heron could hardly believe his eyes. It was the King himself ! '\u2022 It is so,\" said the Duke. \" Then,\" said the King, \" my Lord Clacking ton wUl report proceedings, after which it wiU be the turn of the next on the list to make his choice by giving the name of the \u2014 the victim.\" The King evidently said victim because he was at a loss for another word. It was too evident now that that mysterious house was not in such close proximity to the Palace of St. James's for nothing. That some secret route existed between it and the abode of royalty was now a matter past dis pute. A slight murmur of disapproval ran round the table. The plot was thickening. The King himseU was evidently taking a part A community of vice had familiarized those persons too much with the monarch to make them particular in the expression of their dis approbation. in it. Heron felt certain that it was but a new phase of that kind of Use in which the King was en couraged by such despicable creatures as my Lord Clackington. The eleven persons round the table reseated themselves without a word. CHAPTEE CCXLII The King then spoke. \" WeU, gentlemen, I am here ! Who is the fortunate individual who is to be blessed by the accompUshment of his wishes this night ?\" \" His Grace of Harrington !\" said a voice. The voice grated upon the ear of FeUx Heron. THE COUNCIL CHAMBER Dt THE MYSTERIOUS HOUSE IN PALL-MALL. The King was there only as an individual \u2014 an important one truly \u2014 inasmuch as he could throw the shield of his own invulnerabUity over any of the society who feU into the meshes of the law, but still he did not appear in that room in his character of King of England. \" I should not have said victim,\" he added ; \" but a better word did not come to my aid at the moment.\" It was that of the hateful Lord Clackington, who, since the disappearance of the imaginary Baron Von Peck, had crept again into favour with the King. \" Ah ! I recoUect the lot feU upon his Grace, and I rejoice to see him present !\" \" I humbly thank your Majesty !\" said a voice, which Heron now recognised as the same as that he had heard at Holland House. The various members of the viUanous society bowed their heads in acknowledgment of this sUght apology. \"Yes,\" said another speaker; \"the ballot was duly taken at our last meeting ; and inasmuch as we aU take it by turns, without respect of rank, to name some fair and apparently inaccessibly beautiful girl, who may have attracted our indi vidual fancy, and who is to be brought to the house by the agents of this society, let the cost, the trouble, and the risk be what they may, his Grace avaUed himseU of bis privUege, and named the fair one whom he adored !\" \"We wUl have the report, my Lord Clacking ton,\" said the King. Lord Clackington, in his grating tones, read from the book he had opened : \u2014 \"The name of AmeUa Travers, an artificial flower-maker, supposed to be about the age of sixteen, having been placed in the urn by his Grace of Harlington, the agents of the society were duly instructed in the work they had to do. \" It was discovered that she resided in Moor fields, from whence, daUy, she prpceeded to her employment in Queen Street, Soho. \" From careful and numerous inquiries, it was ascertained that the girl's character was irre proachable ; but as nothing is so fallacious as such characters given by third parties, the elderly gentlewoman who is in the employment of this society sought an interview with her. \" We have that person's report, which is ex ceedingly unsatisfactory, since the girl Ustened to nothing, but repelled all overtures with scorn. \" It became necessary to adopt the other plan of proceedings hitherto found successful in similar cases. \" I did,\" said the Duke of Harlington. u Chance \u2014the mere accident of a moment \u2014 gave me a glance at the fairest face and sweetest figure these mortal eyes ever gazed upon.\" \" Stop !\" said the King. \" Is she of rank ?\" \" Certainly not, your Majesty. We only prey upon the common people.

My Lord Clackington closed the book. There was a sUence of some seconds' duration. \" And,\" said the King, \" my lord marquis, you have named your beauty.\" \"I have, your Majesty.

As he spoke, he produced a folded paper, about the size of a note, which he handed to Lord Clackington. \"Enough \u2014 enough, gentlemen,\" he said; \"1 had f orgotteB.\" \" That is sufficient,\" said the King. \" Thank heaven for so much mercy !\" said the Duke of HarUngton, with a forced laugh. But he was deathly pale. There must have been at the bottom of his heart some Ungering sensation of the villany he contemplated. The shadow of coming remorse was npon his soul. That most obnoxious and profligate individual opened the note, and read in his most croaking tones: \u2014 \"Amelia Travers is secured, and waits in the tapestried drawing-room the pleasure of his Grace of HarUngton.\" It was too evident that a battle was raging in his breast, between the better principles of his nature, and the wUd, lawless pission which had induced him to make one of that assemblage. FeUx Heron heard aU this with great indigna tion. The Duke immediately rose to his feet. \" It is well done, by Jove !\" he cried ; \" it is well and promptly done !\" Lord Clackington repUed to him, drily. \" This society never faUs. An error would be destruction!\" But he was troubled how to act. Even were he to go back to that magnificent apartment in which he had left Amelia, and pro cure from her his sword again, it would be for him far too hazardous an enterprise to attack so large a number of no doubt weU-armed men. It was just possible, however, that even ytt he might fling an arm around that young girL and with his trusty sword: in the other hand, rescue her from the dim shadows and the poUuted atmosphere in that house. The desire to do so grew strongly npon him. It was a desire that he would in aU probabUity have carried out, but that as he paused and he sitased for a few seconds, a change took place in the posture of affairs in what might be caUed the councU room. The King waved his hand, and the Duke re sumed his seat \" To business !\" he said. \" Who stands next upon our list ?\" \" The Marquis of Morecliffe,\" said Lord Clack ington. \" Whom names he ?\" A slim, boyish-looking personage spoke in a piping tone of voice. \" Sinoe it is my turn to name a candidate for the poUte attentions of this society, I beg to say that there is a tradesman's daughter at IsUngton, so dazzlingly beantifuL and yet withal so care fully tended and so narrowly watched, that the voice of adoration can never reach her ears.\" The King spoke. \" My Lord Clackington.\" Clackington bowed. \"Humbly, Mr. President, at your gracious service,\" he said. \" You choose her?\" said Clackington. \"I do!\" \" Her name ?\" \"AmabeUe Tracy.\" \" Good ! It is enough ! Her special residence need only be given, and this day week, Marquis, she wiU be at your disposal.\" \" Her father keeps a cutler's shop in the High Street, Islington. I know not the number ; but with the name and those indications there can be no mistake.\" \" Is there aught else to bring befere this meet ing?\" \" Nothing, sir.\" \" Then it is dissolved untU to-morrow night at the same hour.\" The King rose as he spoke. Every one present Ukewise gained his feet, and bowed low towards the King, who, after a sUght inchnation of the head, left the apartment. Then a few murmured sentences -were ex changed between those who remained. \" None whatever;\" said Cfackmgton. The assembled persons sUghtly inclined then heads, as though they would intimate that that was enough, and that no further particulars need be required for the purpose of decoying or forcing the young girl named to her destruction. After that, one by one they left the room, until only the Duke of HarUngton and Lord Clackington remained. \" Joy, yonr Grace,\" said Clackington, \u2014 \" I wish you joy !\" \"Beptile!\" was the brief reply. Clackington recoUed as though he had been struck. Another of the infamous assembly then loudly spoke. His voice was eager, and he half rose from his chair, as he said, \" When my turn comes, I shall propose the capture of \" \"Hold!\" cried the King, sternly. \"You strangely forget, my lord, one of the primary conditions of tho association \u2014 which is, that no more than one name at a sitting shall be given in, and that, until that name is disposed of, another shaU nor be mentioned.\" \"Did I hear aright?\" \" I said reptile!\" \"Then your Grace shall dearly rue that word !\" \" I wiU meet you, my Lord Clackingten, when and where you wiU !\" \" And this,\" said Lord Clackington, in high, croaking accents, \u2014 \" this ts the reward of aU my \" That is so,\" interposed Lord Clackington ; \" and I should have thought that thc illustrious person who has just spoken, and who has been so"], [197, "EDITH 11KKOJT. 191 exertions in the formation of this little society !

Slowly he wheeled round upon his heels, and cast his gaze into every comer of the apart ment CHAPTER CCXLIII. THE DUKE OF HARLINGTON'S INTERVIEW WITH AMEUA TRAVERS. THE COMBAT. He drew a long breath, and then he spoke. \" Alone \u2014 I am alone, and in the adjoining room is the victim ! This has been my first chance, and shaU I now shrink from it ? Pshaw ! Courage, Harlington \u2014 courage !\" He took two steps towards that identical door through the haU-glazed upper panel of which FeUx Heron had been so deeply an interested spectator of the secret meeting. Heron retreated. Dem as the light was in that gorgeous apartment it seemed to shine speciaUy upon the white face and gUstening eyes of the Duke. Heron heard him speak. \" She is there !\" Amelia uttered a shuddering haU shriek, as with slow steps the Duke advanced. ' The purposed victim and the purposed betrayer gazed at each other then in sUence. It was the Duke who first broke that terrible stillness by speaking in a low, hoarse voice, as though he feared the very spirits of the air \u2014 if there be such things \u2014 should overhear him. \" You are AmeUa Travers ?\" He did not retreat because his Grace of Harling ton was advancing, but he felt that his proper place was by the side of that young girl for whose safety he had pledged his honour. Pledged even his Use ! Heron rapidly sped along the narrow passage, and made his appearance again in the magnificent dr.iwing-room. The speed with which he entered it alarmed Amelia. The words were spoken interrogatively ; and with a great effort, feeling her safety in the con tiguity of Heron, the girl repUed to them. \" My name is AmeUa Travers.\" The Duke advanced another step. \" Did you ever love ?\" This time there was no reply. But AmeUa clutched convulsively the back of the couch with one hand, whUe tho other was stretched imploringly towards the hiding-place of Felix Heron. For a moment, she scarcely recognised him as her friend and deUverer. She uttered a sUght cry, and dropped the sword at her feet. \" Is this the way,\" said Heron, \" you would have defended yourself ?\" She knew his voice, although she could hardly be said to see well the outUnes of his face and form, for the single wax-Ught in that room had burnt lower, and its direct beams were intercepted by the gUttering pendants of the chandeher in which it was ensconced. \" Girl,\" said the Duke, \" I have eyes, and I have seen that you are beautiful. I have ears, and they have drank in the melody of your voice. I am rich, great, and noble. There is not a plea sure which gold can purchase which may not be yours. You have but to say the word \u2014 promis ing at the same time to meet me with a smile and leave me with a smUe.\" \" Courage !\" said Heron. \" Eemember, I shall be with you ! Fear nothing, but be bold and resolute !\" \" I am full of fears ! My heart beats rapidly, and my brain throbs ! I cannot endui-e this trial ! I promised that I would, because I thought I could ! Take me hence ! \u2014 oh, save me, I im plore you!\" She trembled excessively. \" One word,\" said Heron, \" and you shall judgo for yourseU. A man will come here to seek you, whom I should call an unmitigated viUain, and who I would not permit to breathe the same air with you, but that from some words I heard him utter, I believe that his better angel is struggUng with his evil passions.\" \" Save me ! Save mo !\" \" I know not what you mean,\" said Amelia, faintly. \" By violence I have been brought hither. I know you not ; and I demand my Uberty.\" \" I wUl explain.

These words woro addressed to Felix Heron ; but the Duke, in his utter ignorance of the pre sence of a third person there, took them to imply how completely he was a victor upon the occa \u00bbion, and the arbiter of the fate of Amelia. \"You should he proud and happy,\" he said. * It is my dearest wish to make you mine.\" \" That is scarcely possible,\" said Amelia. \" You say that you are great and noble ; and how would a poor work-girl grace your lofty state ?\" \" The brightest gem in my coronet pales before the lustre of your eyes !\" \" Ah, no ! It is not for the dove to mate into the eagle's nest. The lady-wife of such as you are should be sought for in the Court, and not among the humble workers and toilers of the city.\" \" But the lady-love,\" said the Duke, \" may be sought anywhere, so that beauty ratify the choice.\" no honour, no purity without a stain, except fn what you call your high nobiUty \"\" \" Peace ! peace !\" \" Oh, sir, how strangely you mistake ! The honour and the purity of the poor work-girl are dearer possessions to her than to the sisters of a noble, for what has she beside, if those h'ghts of her existence are lost for ever ?\" The Duke of HarUngton took refuge in great anger. A common expedient when it is difficult to reply. \" You do but turn me from you,\" he said, \" not as regards my admiration for your beauty, but in respect to any gentler emotions which might be awakened in my heart.\" \" Have you no mercy ?.\" - \"None. I disclaim the word. With toil trouble, and some mental agony, I have sought you, and consented to the means which have placed you in my power. I wiU not be baulked of my reward.\" \" WUl not my contempt stir you ?\" \" Not even that,; but stiU I say to you again, girL beware; or mingling with my admiration will come a sentiment of hatred, and then, wheu you are the suppUcant, and when you feel that you can have no friend but me in all the world, I shaU cast you off to destruction and despair.\" \" Then,\" said AmeUa, \"I echo that one word. I say to you, despair!\" \"Tome?\" \" I wiU not affect to misunderstand you,\" said Amelia ; \" and in reply, with aU the scorn that I can express, I loathe and reject your offers!\" \" Beware !\"\u25a0 \" I will not beware ; but I repeat my words !\" \" Girl, you know not. where you are.\" \"I am on earth !'* ., ,\" Ay, a\\e 'you '?\"\u2022 \u2022',\u25a0_\u2022>\u2022 \" And there is a heaven above us ! \" \" There may be.

He shrunk back, and would have fallen but that a chair intercepted his backward progress. \"Now, sir,\" said Heron, coldly and sternly, \" do you beUeve, or do you not, that heaven in its own good time can raise up a defender to the helpless and the innocent ?\" \"Confusion!\" window panes gave way to the sudden concussion of the air. The Duke had drawn a pistol from a concealed pocket, arid fired it full at the head of Heron. Had his intent been not quite so murderous, ho might have succeeded in disabUng the noble and gallant defender of AmeUa Travers. But owing to the height of Heron, and to the crouching attitude which the consciousness of guilt had given to the Duke of Harlington, he was compelled to fire in a slant Une upward. All the world knows how easy it is to miss such a shot. \" Yes, my lord Duke, that is the word \u2014 confu sion ! You have well named it.\" \" There is another word !\" haU-shrieked the Duke, in accents of rage. The buUet flew at least six inches over thi head of Heron. \" Doubtless !\" \" You know it not ! It is death ! Death to him who steps in between me and my heart's passion !\" There was a bright flash ! It struck the centre of a large pier-glas; star-ring it into fragments. AmeUa, with a shriek of dismay, feU senseless oil the couch. A sharp report ! A ring and shatter of glass, as some of the Heron spoke as calmly as he had done before. ..\"5 \u00abuu ______\u00bb\u00ab\u00ab No. 77.\u2014 Edith."], [200, "194 EDITH HERON. \" Now, your Grace,\" ho said, \" you have added the crime of attempted murder to the outrage which you contemplated against this poor help less girl, and be assured the time of retribution has arrived for you.\" \"Help \u2014 help!\" cried the Duke. \"Shame upon that cry!\" said Heron; \"and yet it must needs be useless ; for was it not your boast but a short time previously that even the shrieks of outraged innocence would scarcely pe netrate with the faintest echo through these walls?\" A feeling of desperation then came over the Duke of HarUngton. \" Be it so !\" he cried. \" One or both of us shall Ue in death in this room.\" The swords flashed and circled around each other like fiery serpents. But tho combat was brief. Heron's strength and skiU at his weapon soon asserted their supremacy. The Duke feU with a half stifled shriek. Heron's sword had passed through his breast Then Heron turned hastUy to the couch upon which lay the stiU insensible AmeUa, and encircling her slight form with his left arm, he raised her with ease. The Duke shrunk back step by step, feeling his way past the various articles of furniture in the saloon until he reached one of its waUs. There he stood at bay. With flashing energy he drew his sword from its scabbard, and stood upon his guard. \" Be it so,\" he said. \" I wiU not be murdered in cold blood by any bully. Come on, and let me see if this vaunted courage and generosity wUl stand the test of cold steel.\" The furious knocking continued at the door which led to the narrow passage. But that was not the route by which Heron had reached the saloon, and his object was to gain the open landing at the head of the staircase, and so leave the house at once. But every precaution had been taken to pre vent the escape of the poor victim of lawless passion. \" There havo been no vaunts,\" said Heron ; \"but be assured that the courage which has brought me here, alone and unaided, to stand be tween an innocent, gentle girl and her destruc tion, wiU not desert me now.\" Heron strode forward. That door was fast. Heron had no resource but to place Amelia upon another couch, whUe he made an effort to force the door. \" Stop !\" cried the Duke. Heron paused. A feeUng of great dejection began to take pos session of him, for he felt in all probabiUty he should Mil this man. Twice he flung himself against it with aU his force, but it resisted him. Ho felt convinced, however, that it was only tho lock which bid defiance to his efforts. He drew one of his pistols, and was about to adopt thc short, sharp, and ready mode of open ing the lock, by sending a bullet crashing through it, when the door leading to the narrow passage, and at which the heavy knocking had been kept up, suddenly gave way. Two persons appeared. One was Quiver. \" Stop,\" added the Duke : \" this is a duel of Use or death !\" \"You have said it.\" \"But I am noble.\" \" By Courtesy and birth.\" \" And so,\" added the Duke, \" it is net fit that I should cross swords with, perchance, some insolent artizan, who himself, probably, is enamoured of the fair face which has lured me hero to so much danger.\" The other Lord Warringdale. Tho vapour from tho pistol-shot which had been fired by the Duke of Harlington stiU mingled with the atmosphere of the room, imparting a strange haziness to the dim twUight in which it was shrouded \" Banish your scruples,\" said Heron, mourn fuUy; \" and learn from me that in the grada tions of rank which distinguish the nobihty of England, I stand but one step below you.\" \"An earl?\" \" Who caUed for help? \" shouted Warringdale. \" There he is \u2014 shall I fire ? \" said Quiver. \" You have said it.\" \" Fire! \" echoed Warringdale. Heron had just time to interpose himseU be tween Amelia, as she lay upon the couch, and the discharge of a pistol by Quiver. Heron felt at once that ho was unwounded, and darting forward, he, with one sweeping blow of his sword, laid Quiver prostrate. Warringdale made an effort to escape, but Heron detained him. \" Impossible ! I know you not ?\" \"And yet many know me. To you, who stand upon the brink of eternity, I will reveal myself ; and for once trusting to your word, that no intelligible sound can pass these walls, I teU you, false, faithless Duke of Harlington as you are, that I am the proscribed, persecuted Earl of Whitcombe.\" The Duke uttered a strange cry. \" You will fight me now ?\" said Heron. \" No. I fight not with tho dead, or with an impostor living. Tho Earl of Whitcombe is no more. His death is well authenticated.\" He caught him by the breast of his apparel, and hold him up, as in his own natural voice, which Warringdale could never mistake, he said, \" Brother, is this well done ?\" Astonishment \u2014 terror \u2014 perfect fright \u2014 froze the faculties of Lord Warringdale. He could not speak ; and, thoroughly con vinced as he was in his own mind of tho de cease of Heron some timo ago, ho fully believed himself to bo in the grasp of some supernatural being. That was too much for human nature. \" I havo spoken,\" said Heron, \" and you shaU Eght.\" The swords clashed together. \" Help ! Help !\" cried the Duke again. A rapping knocking came at tho door which he himself had slammed so closoly shut. Some concealed spring kept it socure, and whoever was without had no forco sufficient to master it Lord Warringdale fainted, anr* fell heavily to the floor, as Heron released him."], [201, "195 EDITH HERON. A gilt door was at its further extremity. And if Heron had held any donbta that he was really within the precincts of the Palace of St. James's they must needs now have been dispeUed, for over that gUt door were the royal arms in bold reUef. CHAPTEB CCXLIV. HERON, ES ENDEAVOURING TO FIND A WAV OF EGRESS FROM THE MYSTERIOUS HOUSE, SUD- DENLY FINDS HIMSELF IN ST. JAMES'S PALACE. And perhaps any one now but Felix Heron would have hesitated about advancing further in that direction. Heron was a victor. There seemed no one to oppose him now. The thought came over him, that perchance the shortest way to leave that house would bo to pass through that open doorway, and traverse the narrow passage, which surely must have some termination in an outlet to the street. But he did not. The feeling of indignation that had taken pos session of him at the villany that had been at tempted to be practised in the house he had juet left was stUl dominant in his mind. Heron picked up again his senseless burden, and with his sword Still in his grasp, he made his way, in two or three seconds, to the room where the strange and villanous fraternity had held their sitting. The brief, decisive conflict he had likewise had with the Duke of Harlington had produced adegree of excitement which tended in a great measure to banish calm reflection. Bold and confident, therefore, in the justice of the cause he had espoused, Heron pushed forward, stUl carrying his fainting burden in his arms. He opened the gUt door. It led into a large and handsome room, on the hearth of which a fire, fed with some odoriferous wood, was burning. Tho lantern that had dimly lighted them was still there upon the centre of tho table. Heron thought it might be useful, and he managed to lift and carry it in the same hand that held his sword hilt. The door through which the King had passed at the furthor end of that room was open. With but a dreamy kind of idea that it might lead him quickly to tho lower part of the house, Heron passed through it. It led into a small octagonal-shaped chamber, which was iu perfect darkness. A precisely simUar door, however, to that at which ho had entered was opposite to him, and it yielded to a touch. The flickering flames that came from that firo wero the only means by which that apartment was illuminated. They were sufficient. Probably, however, by their uncertainty and slashing waywardness, they made the room look larger than it was, aud lent a mysterious briiliancy to its adornments. A couch was drawn up near to the fireplace ; and a footstool of crimson velvet, richly trimmed with buUion, close to the couch, seemed to in dicate that the latter had been recently occupied. If further evidence was wanted of this fact, it might be found in a handkerchief, trimmed with costly lace, which lay carelessly upon the couch. A complete change came over Felix Heron's sensations about that dim, mysterious house, and he felt that a suspicion which had arisen in his mind, to the effect that there was a diroct commu nication between the mysterious residence and St. James's Palace, was about to be verified by an actual knowledge of tho fact. The aspect of the kind of passage or corridor in which Felix Heron now found himself, was perfectly conclusive on that point. Ono glance about him was sufficient to assure Felix Heron of where he was. He had reached the private apartments of tho King ; and was actually beneath the roof of St. James's Palace. It was weU lit by a lamp carried in the hands of a marble statue. The floor was covered with rich carpeting, and the walls wore adorned with stamped leather, so admirably fashioned that it had aU the effect of a much richer material. Upon that couch the monarch who so un worthUy wore the crown of England had recently sat. Upon that footstool ho had rested. And, doubtless, the costly lace handkerchief was Heron was glad to be roleased from the care of tho lantern, which would have interfered very much with the free use of his sword-arm. his. By some natural impulse, Heron felt a distaste at the latter article. He placed it upon the side of the pedestal which supported the statue, and then without pausiug another moment ho strode forward, deter mined that by courage and perseverance he would find a route to the open air. Ho looked anxiously now in the face of Amelia, for there was light enough to enable him to do so. With the point of his sword he at once jerked it into the wood fire. He then placed AmeUa gently and tenderly upon the couch, and began to ask himself, with some anxiety, whether it was not necessary to take some immediate steps towards her re covery. A feehng of alarm took possession of him at tho aspect of the deathlike face. Felix Horon had every roason to beUevo that it was but a swoon, which excitement and excess ef feeling had thrown her into ; yet it looked so like death, that he might weU be excused for looking upon it with a degree of alarm, such as any one Uttle versed in feminine fainting might feel. For aU he knew, that swoon \u2014 U swoon it were \u2014 might deepen into death, if not checked in its onward progress. But there was nothing there by which he might aid her.

Such was the state of things in that chamber of royalty, when another door than that at which Heron had entered was flung open. Two persons entered the room most hurriedly. Heron had just time to crouch down by the side of the couch, to prevent himself from being immediately seen. \" As you please,\" said Lord Clackington. \" I interfere with no man's superstition, and am only thankful to have uone of my own. The King is doubtless in what he calls his oratory.\" \" I have heard of that apartment,\" said War ringdale. Clackington laughed. \" Yes ; all the werld has heard of it as the room to which his Majesty retires to vent curses upon the head of his own son, the Prince of Wales.\" He did not hope, though, for a single moment, that he should escape observation ; and he pre pared himself for another conflict, the issue of which might be another death inflicted by his hands upon some of the iniquitous party as sembled that night in St James's. But the most improbable things will happen at times ; and so it occurred upon this occasion, that neither of these parties approached the fireplace, but, speaking almost together in hurried accents, they paused about the centre of the floor. \" Whero is the King ?\" That is the question which came simultaneously from both their lips. \"Where is the King?\" They had evidently expected to find him in that room. \" It is a disunited family ; but the affairs of this world are fading from me.\" \" Stuff \u2014 stuff ! You will be better to-morrow. Get you home, and take a bumper of burgundy with a hot toast in it, and all these superstitious fancies will fly away like a white mist before the sun.\" \" I have no home.\" \" No home ?\" \"None! I am a lonely man! I have slept some nights at Holland House ; but that is full of strange noises and mysterious mutterings. In truth, I know not where to go, for I somewhat dread to be alone !\" \"This is rare foUy!\"said Clackington; \"but since such is your feeUng, you are welcome to accompany me to my house at Westminster. But I must see the King first ; and as, upon reflection, his Majesty might not exactly desire your pre sence, what say you to waiting for me here ?\" \" I will do so \u2014 I wUl do so !\" Heron slightly raised his head, and looked over the edge of the couch. Dimly, and with that red light from the fire upon them, he could see these two men. One was Lord Clackington. The other was Warringdale. Each had a drawn sword, and the long, slen der blades looked blood-red as the dull crimson glare from the decaying embers feU upon them. \" His Majesty is not here,\" said Lord Clack ington. \"Be it so, then. I will return to you as quickly as may be.\" Heron made certain in his own mind that War- 1 ringdale would approach the fireplace ; and such doubtless would have been the fact, but for the pecuUar state of mind of Warringdale at that time. \" How terrible is this adventure !\" groaned Warringdale. \" It is useless to reason with me, my lord, since I shall believe to my dying day that I have seen a spectre.\" Clackington laughed in his hideous, croaking fashion. He had a terrible dread that some ono was behind him. And as that terror increased, he feared even to cross the floor of the apartment. He wheeled a massive arm-chair with its back against the waU, between two of the windows, and sitting down in it ho faced the fireplace, although at a considerable distance from it, aud cut off from a more than very casual observation of the upper portion of the chimney-piece by various articles of furniture. \" I am not so easy of beUef.\" \" It is possible\u2014 it is possible,\" said Warring dale. \" You know, my lord, that there are more things in heaven and on earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy.\" \" Show me that there is anything but earth,\" sneered Clackington, \" and I will believe you.\" \" I will not argue the point, but I have seen a spectre.\" Lord Clackington went to seek the King in the oratory he had mentioned. And now those two brothers were alone. _\" Pooh ! poob ! You have seon it in your imagination.\" One so full of superstitious fear. The other so perplexed to determine ia his \"No; as I am a living man, I have seen tho"], [203, "EDITH HERON. 197 own mind what he should do to extricate him self from his present position. The effect was to evolve from them a faint blue flickering flame, which lasted for several seconds. The act by which Felix Heron had made him self partiaUy known to Lord Warringdale had been so purely impulsive, that almost from the moment he had regretted it. By that indiscretion of a moment \u2014 for such he began to consider it \u2014 he had hazarded the dis covery of his existence in a quarter where, of all others, it was likely to be most fatal to the peace and happiness of himself and to Edith. If, however, the delusion which had taken pos session of the mind of Warringdale, to the effect that it was the spectre of his brother, FeUx Heron, whom he had seen, could be perpetuated, and in any way deepened, the circumstance would cease to present itseU in any anxious manner to the mind of Felix. Slowly, then, before it expired, Heron rose up with very much the appearance as U he had come in the accredited and approved ghostlike fashion, perpendicularly through the floor of the room. To the terrified eyes of Warringdale, that must have been precisely the effect. Higher and higher still rose Heron, untU he attained his full height Then he spoke. But he had his doubts whether speaking were not all in vain, since Warringdale remained seated in the arm-chair in piers ect silence, so trans fixed with terror that it was doubtful whether his senses remained to him. And here fortune or providence seemed to have presented him the opportunity of exactly carrying out some such idea. If Heron himseU had had the opportunity of placing Warringdale in a particular position in that room, favourable to a continuance of his superstitious fears, he could not have devised the position better than Warringdale had done him seU. CHAPTEE CCXLV. FELIX HERON HAS AN INTERVIEW WITH THE KING, AND SAVES AMELLV TRAVERS. The appearance of Heron reflected against the dim firelight, must have been awful and spectral in the extreme. A profound silence was in and about the apartment, although, slightly and at times, Heron, for the first few minutes after Lord Clackington had left, thought he heard the mermur of voices. Even to any one who was not prepossessed with the idea that he was no more, his aspect must have partaken largely of the supernatural. But to Warringdale there could not interpose a doubt upon the subject. These, however, died away, and aU was stiil as the grave. Warringdale did not speak. But Heron heard him breathing heavily* Situated as he was, crouching down between the couch and the fire-place, he, Heron, was per fectly free from observation ; but he was, at the same time, pecuharly weU situated for the pur pose of producing, if he so desired it, a startling effect upon Warringdale. By the dim Ught of the fire, Heron stole a glance upon the fair face of Amelia That deep and deathlike swoon which had begun to alarm Heron so much, stUl continued. But let the consequences be what they might, he resolved to free himself from the obnoxious presence of Warringdale, from whom he would receive no assistance, and with whom it seemed he could never again make up his mind to fight. Heron felt quite confident he could easUy scare him from the place. And Heron, now that ho had made up his mind that his brother should recognise him, had. removed the wig, which was part of his disguise as Captain Fantome, and appeared, in that dim fire-light, sufficiently like himself to render a mistake of his identity quite impossible to one who knew him so well as Lord Warringdale. \"Beware!\" he said, in deep, hollow accents \u2014 \" beware ! and seek no more tiie path of evil. Ee pent ye, whUe there is yet time, and fly from further communion now with one who carries with him a surrounding air that may not be long breathed by mortaUty.\" This was just the sort of threat to have all its effect upon Lord Warringdale. The small amount of sense or power of action that was left him was instantly in motion to fly from that spot. \" Mercy ! mercy !\" he cried. \" I will \u2014 I do re pent ! Do not kill me by another word ! Already I feel the air thickening about me : it is very cold, and grasps my heart as with the fingers of the dead !\" A stealthy glance enabled him to see that War ringdale. eyes were fixed straight before him, as if he feared any wandering observation around the apirtment would transfix his gaze on some sight of horror from which he could not with draw it. \" Fly !\" said Heron. \" Fly, whUe time is your own !\" With a cry of despair that no doubt had in it an expression of physical pain \u2014 for imagination made Warringdale beUeve he was choking \u2014 he rose and fled from the room. Heron now commenced operations. Hf uttered a low, lengthened moan. Amid the profound stiUness of the room, the sound attracted the observation of Warringdale instantly. Heron was satisfied. He felt that he had fully substantiated in the mind of Warringdale the idea he was dead, and he hoped that the shock he had given to his superstitious fears would have the effect of alter ing his mode of lUe. And now that this much was accomplished, Heron's anxieties and fears as regarded Amelia returned in full force. He echoed the moan by a haU-stifled cry of fear. Heron's object had been exactly to attract his attention to the hearth in front of the fire place. With the point of his sword, then, he gently stirred the red embers of the wood fire."], [204, "198 EDITH HERON. \" Ah !\" cried the King. \" That again ? We thought that ghost was laid.\" \" And so did I, your Majesty ; but Warring dale is so precise upon the subject that it seems difficult to contradict him. He says that not only does he know his brother's face and voice well \u2014 so weU, indeed, that it is impossible he can be mistaken \u2014 but he was actuaUy addressed by the term ' Brother.' \" The necessity of procuring for her some assist ance, and dissipating, U possible, tho swoon that still possessed her, became to bis mind painfuUy apparent. Ho crossed the room, and passed out of it at the door through which he had seen Lord Clack ington make his exit. That door led again into a small corridor, which abruptly turned to the right. A gleam of light came through the open door way, and Felix Heron again heard the murmur of voices. \" By the spectre ?\" \" Even so, your Majesty.\" \" What is the time ?\" \" It is nearly three o'clock.\" \" Then it is a good two hours yet to dawn.\" \" Oh, your Majesty,\" said Clackington ; \"surely, U we are to beUeve in ghosts, we are not obUged to adopt all the idle tales concerning them ?\" \" What idle tales ? Who spoke of idle tales ?\" \" I thought your Majesty alluded to the gene raUy received idea that it was only between sun set and sunrise that disembodied spirits could appear to the Uving.\" Those voices evidently came from a room Heron was now fast appoaching. He thought he detected and identified them both. One was the King. The other Lord Clackington. Three steps more brought him to the door, which -was a few inches open, and then he heard dis tinctly what was being said. \" AU this sounds incredible,\" said the King ; ~\" but it must be met with the utmost caution, and, U necessary, with all the forco and violence that will put a stop to any such danger.\" \"It shall be seen to, your Majesty,\" said Clackington, \" but I own to being bewUdered and terrified. The Duke of HarUngton is killed, and some unknown power has carried off the girL whither we know not, and by a means perfectly inexplicable.\" \"You talk in riddles, my lord,\" said the King, \" or your fears have got the upper hand of your reason. Some carelessness or some folly has been perpetrated, and we are all now liable to an exposure of a most uncomfortable description.\" \" WiU your Majesty pardon me U I tell yon what is Lord Warringdale's opinion upon the subject?\" \" Pardon you ? What need of pardon ? TeU me at once.\" \" Peace, peace, my Lord Clackington ! We had no such notions. Speak to us of all this in the morning. We are now fatigued, and it ap pears to us that we have more trouble than profit from this society of your creation.\" Lord Clackington took this as a hint to de part. How he left the royal presence FeUx Heron was not aware, but no doubt there were modes of exit and entrance to that suite of apartments, which, situated as he was, he had no means of observing. One thing, however, was quite evident. The King was now alone. That was the opportunity Heron sought. He was determined to intrude himself upon the royal presence, however unbidden or unwel come a guest he might be. . But the King was speaking to himseU in low, muttered tones, and Heron paused to hear what it was that troubled the royal imagination. He could hear, too, that the King was pacing the room to and fro, and this gave him a notion that he might be enabled to take something of a survey of the place without being himself seen. Waiting until the royal footsteps were evidently receding from the partially-open door, Heron ad vanced and looked in. \" I feel the need of pardon, because what I have to say wiU, in your Majesty's judgment, sound irivolous and absurd.\" \" What can it be ? Speak on, my lord.\" * Warringdale, then, gives a supernatural expla nation of the affair.\" \" Supernatural ?\" \" Even so, your Majesty.\" FeUx Heron heard a chair hastily moved ; and he had some idea that the fears of the King were sufficiently aroused to induce him, probably, to adopt the same plan that Lord Warringdale had done to be certain no one was behind him. That plan was to place his chair against a wall. He saw the King plainly. He saw that the room was a kind of dressing closet, and he had no doubt that the royal chamber lay immediately beyond it. Then Heron took the opportunity, after the King had passed the door again, and again turned his back upon it, to glide into the room. He seated himself upon the first chair he came to, and quietly waited until the King should turn again and walk with his face towards him. The King paused. \"Help! treason! What\u2014 what is this ?\" The appearance of Heron was sufficiently mysterious to awaken all the fears of tho King. But Heron had put on the wig which so mate rially helped to disguise him as Captain Fan tome. He could not say that such was the fact ; but tho movement ef the chair was suspicious. The King now spoke in a lower tone ; and, as Felix Heron had good reason to believe in the superstitious tendencies of the royal mind, he could easUy account for the change. \" In what way,\" said the King, \" does War ringdale attribute supernatural agency to this affair ?\" \" He states, your Majesty, in the midst of tho confusion he was addressed by an apparition.\" The King's chair moved again. \" An apparition, my Lord Clackington ?\" \"Yes, your Majesty. The apparition of his brother, the lato Earl of Whitcombe.\" He replied to the royal exclamation likewise in a feigned voice, for he had no desire to pass himself off to the King oither as the mortal Earl of Whitcombe or his ghost"], [205, "199 EDITH HEROlf. \" Your Majesty is alarmed,\" said Heron, \"and perhaps not without reason. \" It wiU be danger ous, however, to call too loudly for aid, since I am a weU-armed, resolute man.\" what he was saying, perhaps, had more effect upon the royal conscience,\u2014 and, probably, the royal fears, \u2014 than U he had directly accused the King of compUcity in the abduction of Amelia Travers. The King had made a movement to a par ticular part of the chamber, where Heron \u2014 although he could not see it, so artfully contrived in the paneUing was it \u2014 felt convinced there was a door. \"In pursuance of the designs of this asso ciation, a young, innocent, and virtuous girl has been carried off.\" \" Indeed !\" \" Stop, your Majesty,\" he said. \" Your flight may be swift, but there is something here that is swifter.\" \" Yes, your Majesty ; but I have rescued her, and she is now, not far from this spot, in a deep swoon induced by terror and exhaustion.\" The King turned round, as U he fully expected to see Amelia Travers in that very room. \" Nay,\" said Heron, \" she is not here ; but I can conduct your Majesty to her; and, in her name, I have three favours to ask of you !\" \" Three favours ?\" \" Ah ! \" The King paused. Heron had produced a pistol. He laid its barrel carelessly over the arm of the chair in which he sat, and its muzzle pointed directly to tho royal breast. \" There is not the remotest intention,\" added Heron, \"of committing any outrage; but your Majesty's presence is desired here for a short time longer.\" \" This is treason ! \" \" Yes. The first is, that your Majesty wUl supply me, from yonder well-furnished buffet, with some refreshments and stimulants which wUl restore the girl to sense and to existence.\" \"Oh, wfllingly!\" \" The next is that you wUl graciously enable her, under my escort, to leave this place in safety and security.\" \" Be it so.\" \"Very likely! \" \" And whoever you are, I wonld warn you that your acts are such that \u2014 that \" The King was evidently at a loss to know what to say. \" The third is, that yon will place in my hands a thousand pounds, as some sUght recompense to this poor young girl for the terror she has expe rienced and the inconvenience she has undergone.\" \" A thousand pounds ?\" \"Yes, your Majesty, that is the sum.\" The King caught at the vague idea that, after aU, Heron did not mean to accuse him of any part in the abduction of Amelia. \" Why should I,\" he said, \" pay a thousand pounds for other people's iniquities ?\" \" Oh, U your Majesty were yourseU guilty, in any shape or way, I should name ten thousand at the very least !\" The King began to think he was getting off cheaply. \" Your Majesty may spare your breath,\" said Heron. \" Kings are only kings, after all, by the grace of those who choose to caU them so ; and now, as we are here alone, we are but as two men, and I have that to say to you which you shail listen to.\" The King glanced at the barrel of the pistol, and felt that he was in the power of his unknown visitor. \" Speak!\" he said. \" What havo you to say ? But teU me first who you are ?\" \" I am a gentleman I\" The King made a sarcastic sort of half-bow. \" Surely,\" he said, \" I ought to have guessed as much by your unbidden and unwelcome intru sion into these apartments !\" \" That sneer shall not move me !\" said Heron. \" I have something to say, and a complaint to make, which, perhaps, might not have been Us tened to so patiently under ether circumstances !\" \" Say on, sir !\" \" Your Majesty is, or should he, a sort of father to your people ; and aU those who require protec tion, either from infancy or inabiUty to protect themselves, or from want of friends to stand for ward in their behaU, ought to look to the King, as the head and chief of the State, to be their natural guardian !\" \" We agree,\" he said ; \" but stUl I cannot help thinking that U this young person you mention is such a paragon of virtue, it is strange she puts a money value on it\" \" She does not, your Majesty ; for had the in famous purpose for which she was brought here been carried out, it is not a thousand pounds, but some human Uves, that must have answered for it.\" The King was silenced. \" Now,\" said Heron, \"some wine from yonder buffet!\" The King brought it, and foUowed Heron to the room in which AmeUa was lying. A small quantity of the generous liquid with difficulty having passed her Ups, restored her. She looked about her in an agony of fear. \" Calm yourself,\" said Heron ; \" all is safe, and all is weU. This gentleman wiU conduct os to the open ah-.\" \" FoUow,\" said the King. \" One moment!\" added Heron. \" Well, sir, what then ?\" \"And more particularly,\" continued Heron, \"should youth and innocence, when subjected to the snares of the wicked and the designing, be your Majesty's special care i\" The King winced a little. \"I can inform your Majesty that there is a laud of club, or association, of infamous men, formed for the express purpose of perpetrating, by violence, so much iniquity that your Majesty would blush to the roots of your royal hair to think you governed a kingdom that produced such specimens of depravity !\" The King made no reply. Heron continued, in low and distinct tones ; and \"What next?\" \"The thousand pounds, U you please.\" A look of chagrin came over the face of th.9 King, and it was sufficiently marked, notwith standing the inefficient light in that room, for Felix Heron to see it."], [206, "200 EDITH HERON. In fact, the one wax-candle which Felix Heron had brought with him from the King's private chamber but very dimly lighted the apartment. The smouldering wood fire had gone com pletely out, although the soft and pleasant odour from the scented wood, of which it had been composed, was still mamfest in the air of the room. The favourite honr for knights of the road to commence their excursions. Tom's experience had told him that there was Uttle good to be done on road or heath after mid night It was the quiet, orderly people, who went home early, who were best worth crying \" Stand and deliver!\" to. The King took a smaU pocket-book from his coat, and handed it to Heron. \" I beUeve,\" he said, \" there is more than the sum mentioned in that book.\" They were the folks, likewise, who were least Ukely to make resistance. The young rakes and bloods of the town, and the rather loosely-disposed characters who were out in the small hours of the night, generally had little to lose ; and just in proportion as that was the case, they were incUned to fight des perately for its retention. Tom knew aU this quite well. And having, as he imagined, secured Daisy's assent to a night of adventure, he rapidly ad justed the saddle, and made her ready for the road. \" Kings should be generous,\" said Heron. \" The surplus wUl be placed to the account of royalty ; and now, your- Majesty having fulfilled every other condition, it only remains that this young lady and myseU intrude upon your kind ness to show us out of the Palace.\" \" This way.\" The King took a key from his pocket, and opened a tall, narrow door in the wall, beyond which there appeared a flight of rather steep steps. \"Now,\" said Tom, \"wait a bit, Daisy, and I shaU soon be ready. Ah ! here we are, all safe.\" From a shelf in the stable Tom took down a parcel that contained his highwayman's apparel. It had been his original intention on all oc casions to leave that costume at his mother's house in Wardour Street. Upon second thoughts, he had brought it with him to the stable. In that bundle, Ukewise, was the riding-habit, by the aid of which Tom hoped and expected to achieve some amusing adventures. \" Now, Daisy, lass,\" he said. \" Only you wait a few minutes, and I shall be ready.\" It was an intense satisfaction to Tom Bipon to be able once again to attire himself in his some what picturesque highwayman's costume. Tom surveyed himself with considerable com placency in a smaU triangular piece of looking glass, which he had naUed up in the stable, pre tending it was fdr the use of Daisy. \" Well,\" he said, \" I think that is rather the thing ; so now off we go, my beauty !\" \" Pass two persons !\" he cried out, aloud. Felix Heron, assisting AmeUa, descended the steps. They saw no one ; but a door was flung open, through which came a grateful gush of cool night air. In another moment they were in the Colour Court of St. James's Palace. \" TeU me truly,\" said Heron, to Amelia Travers, \" is any one awaiting you at home, or wUl there be anxiety on your account ?\" \" Alas ! no one. I am very lonely.\" \" Then you shaU become acquainted with the Countess of Whitcombe, and let us hope that this night's adventure will be the dawn of a new era of happiness in your existence.\" The young girl's feelings had been strongly excited, and 6he wept freely, as Felix Heron con ducted her to Whitcombe House. Tom folded up the lady's riding-habit into a compact parcel, which could easUy be strapped to the back of the saddle. CHAPTEB CCXLVI. His next care was to examine his pistols, which, in those days, was a much more important matter than at present. TOM RIPON TAKES COUNSEL WITH DAISY. \u2014 THE COMPACT. Thrusting them, then, into the holsters of the saddle, Tom felt that he was fuUy equipped and ready for the road. He led Daisy carefuUy and quietly out of the stable into the by-street at the back of Whitcombe House. \"Well, Daisy,\" said Tom Bipon, \" what do you say to a trot on the green-sward ? I don't think we made so bad an affair of it, did we, beauty, the last time we went out?\" Tom was patting Daisy's neck in the stable of Whitcombe House, as he spoke. Nothing could, in a general way, be more solitary and deserted than that street. But, upon this occasion, just as Tom emerged from the stable, a watchman, with some exalted notions of duty, came slowly down it. \" Plague take the old fool !\" said Tom. \" What does he want here ?\" And it would almost seem that the intelligent creature haU understood him, for Daisy placed her head upon his shoulder, and fixed her large eyes gently upon his face. \"Well,\" added Tom, \"U you say that's your opinion, as weU as mine, I don't see what's to hinder us going out, and trying our luck again.\" Tom had quite made up his mind that on the first opportunity, he would saddle Daisy for the road again. Acting upon the general leave he had from Felix Heron to take Daisy out for exercise, Tom engrafted rather a large Ucense upon that ex pression. It was ten o'clock. \" Past ten o'clock, and a cloudy night!\" \" Well, everybody knows that,\" said Tom, \" without it being bawled out in that kind of way. I'U be off before the old stupid gets this far !\" Tom put his foot in the stirrup, and mounted Daisy ; but the back street was so narrow that he could not escape being within the sphere of the watchman's lantern."], [207, "201 EDITH HERON. \" Hilloa !\" said the guardian of the night ; '\u2022 who are you, and what do you want here ?\" \" Don't you know me f said Tom. \" How should I know you ? You look Uke a highwayman !\" \" That's just it.\" \" What's just it ?\" \"I am a highwayman, or rather, I was a high wayman. I am the ghost of the celebrated Dick Tui-pin, and I am bound to come on my horse, Black Bess here, once a year, to ride over the first watchman I see. You'd better stoop. For ward, Daisy ! Over him !\" \" Murder !\" cried the watchman, as he crouched down, juet in time probably to save his head from Daisy's heels, who made a flying leap over his back. time ; and who knows but some of it may come back to my share to-night ?\" Daisy was full of lUe and spirits. The quiet life she led in the old stables ot Whitcombe House was very different to that she had been for so long accustomed to in the forest. The feel of the night air, and the sight of the trees and herbage which then, when London had not gone so far out of town, were soon reached, appeared to inspire Daisy with the most agreeable sensations. In fact she seemed inclined for gaUoping, which would have had the effect of testing Tom Eipon's horsemanship. \"Woa! woa, Daisy!\" he cried. Daisy permitted herself to be reinedin, and as Tyburn Fate was close at hand, T_\u2122 thought it better to assume an air of quietuSe and come posure. \" On we go,\" said Tom. \" I shaU tako the Western Eoad again. I had lots of luck there last No. 78.\u2014 Edith."], [208, "EDITH HERON. 202 The keeper of that gate, howover, had too much experience of knights of the road not to he perfectly well aware that Tom was one of them. Anil so long as he got his toll, he cared little about it ; and, in fact, at that period, the toll-bar keepers within ten miles of London were so liberally paid by gentlemen of Tom's sort, that they were generally ready to fling open the gate for them when hardly pressed, without a thought of the toll on that particular occasion. It was always good poUcy for a successful highwayman to fling a guinea to a gate-keeper. And it may be considered that it was this reck less manner in which tho plunder of the road was distributed, that so greatly assisted in prolonging the career of the knights of the highway. There never was a roadside inn at which one stopped to taste a glass of spirits, that he did not pay at least ten times the value for. Who so popular, then, as the dashing highway man, who took guineas from the rich, to scatter them among the poor? Tom was highly flattered on going through Tyburn Gate on this occasion. Being well provided with money, in con sequence of his last adventure, he flung the man a crown piece with a \" keep the change\" kind of an air, which was not to be mistaken. \" Thank you, Captain,\" said the man. \"Good night, and fair weather to you.\" Tom was wonderfuUy elated. \" Good night \u2014 good night!\" he cried. \" Any body in particular on the road?\" \" Why, no, Captain, only the ugly one.\" \" Who do you mean ?\" \" Jonathan Wild.\" a fair and elegant young creature, his widow- Quite a dove, too, in temper ; and as I thought it a pity she should go cooing about by herseU, why I proposed to her, and married her ; and here I am, landlord of tho l Cat and Snuffers,' and get ting quite joUy!\" Before Tom could make any remark upon this narrative a high, screaming voice echoed from the interior of the httle hostel. \"Now, you good for nothing, idle vagabond, what are you gossiping out there for, instead of attending to your lawful business. Must I take the roasting spit again to you, you good for nothing thief?\" \" Oh,\" said Tom, \" is that the dove ?\" Number Ten rubbed his head. \" Well, you know, Tom, women are precarious, and, at times, I must confess that \u2014 that \" \" You needn't say anything more about it,\" said Tom; \"and don't give your mind to jealousy ; for if you should go off the hooks, you may de pend I shaU not propose for the charming young widow of the ' Cat and Snuffers.' So now let us have a glass of purl.\" \" Directly, Tom \u2014 directly. But I assure you you ha---- heard aud seen the worst of her.\" \" Ht . . I ?\" \" Most certainly, Tom, and, on the word of an old acquaintance, I can assure you \"' \" Take that !\" .oreamed a high voice, again ; and a female, of rather extraordinary height sud denly appeared at tbe door, and commenced, with the vigour of a patent threshing-machine, laying a stick over Number Ten's back. \" What a beauty!\" said Tom. \" I won't wait for the purl. She'd have to look at it, and it would turn it sour ! Good night, Number Ten ! Can't you find a bit of old rope to hang yourseU with ?\" \" Oh, he's on the road, is he ?'' j' Yes, Captain. He takes a canter down it every night about this hour ; and I should rather say he's looking for somebody.\" The tone in which the gate-keeper pronounced the word somebody, let Tom fnUy understand that he was meant. Tom put Daisy to a half gaDop, and rapidly left the \" Cat and Snuffers \" far behind him. He reached a sequestered and lonely bit of the Western Boad, not far from a narrow lane that leads to East Acton, and where a windmiU was slowly moving its gigantic arms in the night air. \" Very good,\" he said. \" We may meet ; and U we do, it wiU be all the worse for one or other of us. I rather think, however, that one won't be me.\" Tom then heard the rapid sound of horse's feet coming on at a hard trot, accompanied by the grinding of wheels upon the loose roadway. In a few seconds the gleam of hghts from an approaching vehicle shone upon the hedge-rows. Tom drew up, and waited with some impatience a real highwayman's encounter. He had not long to wait before a stage coach appeared. Tom instantly darted out from bis place of concealment, and, going to the door, presented a pistol, and cried \" Stand and deliver !\" Scarcely were the words uttered than a pistol bullet spun through the air, grazing the side of Tom's hat. \" Good luck, Captain ; and good night !\" \" Amen !\" said Tom, \" as old Mortiiication would say.\" \u25a0 He gallopped onward ; and was soon through the outlying district of Bayswater, and fairly on the Western Boad. There was a little public-house at the corner of a lane, not far from the long, shadowy avenue which, at that time, led to Brook Green. Tom pulled up there, and caUed out aloud, \" House ! house !\" The landlord ran out ; and then started with surprise, as he cried out, \" Why, it's Daisy !\" \"Hush !\" said Tom. \"Who are you?\" \" And it's Tom Bipon !\" \" Good gracious ! Hold your tongue ! I don't know you a bit!\" At first he was so taken by surprise that he almost lost his presence of mind ; but, feeling assured that he was not injured, he bethought himself of a stratagem. Slipping down from Daisy's saddle, and lying full length iu the road, he managed, whUe in that position, to cut the traces. By this time, Tom could attend to other matters, and soon distinguished the tones of a man, who, in piping accents, called out, \" Fcar \" I'm Number Ten. Don't you recoUect me in the Forest ? I'm a married man ; and have turned quite respectable.\" \" The deuce you have !\" said Tom. \" That must bo duU, isn't it?\" \" WeU, no, not exactly.

Come, Daisy, come !\" Tom led Daisy in the darkness to the corner of a lane where there was a finger-post, to which he tied her bridle. \" Drive on !\" roared he to the coachman. \" Please, sir, the 'osses has run away ! Mr. Highwayman must have cut the traces; for, just as I was about to drive on, according to your lordship's orders, they tore away, and nearly dragged me from the box.\" \" Fool !\" roared the voice from the inside of the coach. \" I wUl have you \" \" Stay there, my beauty,\" he said, \"until I come and fetch you ! I am now going to pay a visit to Maria Jane !\" \"Stop a bit, old boy!\" said Tom, suddenly starting up from the bottom of the coach. \" Stop a bit ; just hand over to me all the property you happen to have about you, and then you can have a shot at your coachman, if you like \u2014 but don't keep me waiting, or it will be worse for you !\" The consternation of the passengers in the coach, on finding the supposed dead highwayman fully prepared to assert aU the privileges of his profession, was immense. The ladies screamed and huddled together, so as to leave a considerable space for Tom, who, cooUy seating himseU opposite to the old gentle man, threw up the pan of one of his pistols, and settling the powder around the touch-hole, said, with a preternatural kind of calmness, \" Every dog has his day ! It's my turn now ! You've had your shot, and it's only fair I should return it.\" CHAPTEE CCXLVII. TOM RIPON MAKES A GOOD BOOTY. CONGRATU- LATIONS. Tom quickly made his way to the coach, and again lay down upon his back, and while in that posi tion he had no difficulty in hearing all that was said by the passengers in the coach. \" What shall we do with the fellow?\" asked the gentleman with the piping voice. \" I have suc ceeded in ridding the world of a monster, there is no doubt about that !\" \" Have you, old feUow!\" said Tom to himself. \" I vote,\" continued the man with the piping voice, \"that we put the highwayman into the coach, and carry him to town. If he isn't dead, lie will be long before he can offer any resistance, and then just fancy tho eclat of capturing a knight of tho road !'' The old gentleman uttered a cry of dismay. He strove to drop to his knees to tho bottom of tho coach, but Tom propped him up with the barrel of the pistol. \" No, no,\" he said, \" that's not fair; and, besides, it would be decidedly inconvenient !\" \" Mercy, mercy !\" \" Exactly so \u2014 the same mercy you had upon me.\" There seemed to be some disagreement between the ladies on this occasion as to the desirableness of taking into the coach a known highwayman ; but one of them asked, with a lisp, which she evidently intended to be youthful, \"Is he young, do you think, Adolphus ? \" \" Young ? No, of course not ! \" roared Adol phus. \" Highwaymen are never young. Ho is an old, grey-headed, horrid-looking man, enough to frighten any ono, even in the noonday ! \" \" Thank you, old pump !\" said Tom to him seU. \" We'll see soon whether the fair Maria Jane does not think me handsome.\" \" But I didn't mean to shoot you.\" \"Indeed!\" \" Yes, it was only a threat.\" \" A threat from the barrel of a pistol !\" \" But I missed you on purpose, you dear, kind youth. I assure you I did. I said to myself, ' Here is a young man, who, perchance, has been led astray in consequence of his good looks by bad company \u2014 I might shoot him, but won't \u2014 I'll pretend to do so, but miss him.' \" \" Stuff !\" said Tom. With this, the man who had fired the pistol bullet at Tom Eipon alighted from the coach, and coming round to whore Tom was lying, touched him with his foot, which action was not re sponded to by Tom. \" It is true, on my honour.\" \" Then how came you to hit me ?\" \" Hit you ?\" \" Yes \u2014 you'll pretend next that the bullet ia not in my head now.'' \" In your head ?\" \" Exactly so \u2014 along with five others that I have received at different times during my ad ventures on the road. So now, you see, there's an end of the question.\" \"Mercy on us!\" \" Prop yourself up in that corner, and you won't tumble on the ladies.\" \"All's right \u2014 ho is dead enough, I beUeve. Here, Jones, help me to stow this feUow inside the coach !\" The coachman dismounted from his box, and, with his assistance, Tom was lifted into the coach. The coachman had orders to remount the box, and drive as fast as his horses would allow him, towards London, whero it was intended to lodge Tom Eipon in the first round-house they came to. , . Tom lay quite still, huddled up at the bottom of the coach, and was highly amused to hear the lady whom he supposed to be Maria Jane ex claim, \" Oh, you wretch ! You have killed a handsome young man ! You told me he was old, aud look at him !\" \" Murder ! murder !\" shrieked the females, aU in chorus. \" Spare his Use, and take everything we have !\" The old gentleman looked so ghastly and spectral from the state of mortal fright he was in, that"], [210, "204 EDITn HERON. Tom thought he had carried the joke far enough. \"We can't clear the way,\" said the coachmaa \"We have lost our osses !\" \" Very weU, ladies,\" said Tom \" To obhge you I'll let him go this time, but it is a very hard thing for me to be going about with six ounces of lead in my brains, you must allow.\" \" Oh, take everything !\" cried all the ladies ; \" take everything. We are so much obliged to you, you can't think.\" Tom soon found his hands full of plunder, which he rapidly transferred to his pockets. But the old gentleman made no movement to add to Tom's store. \" Ah ! How is that ?\" \" A highwayman.\" \" That scoundreL Tom Eipon, for a thousand pounds !\" \" Thank you,\" said Tom to himself ; \" I can re turn that compUment. I know that voice only too well; and I can say, with far greater truth , that scoundrel Wild, for double the money !\" \" Yes,\" cried all the ladies at once, and the old gentleman likewise, \u2014 \" yes, we've all been robbed by a highwayman !\" \" Au ugly fellow,\" said Mr. Bumpus. \" Oh, dear, no !\" cried all the ladies in chorus, \" not ugly !\" \" Silence !\" cried Wild. \" Coachman, teU mo all about it. I am an officer ; and, perhaps, you may have heard my name on some odd occa sion.\" \" I see,\" said Tom, \"that he don't value his own Use, and therefore it is just as well to put him out of the world. He gives nothing, you see.\" \"For shame, Mr. Bumpus!\" cried one of the ladies, who evidently knew him well ; \" why don't you give the young man your watch and money ?\" Mr. Bumpus only groaned. \" I have no time to spare.\" said Tom. He seized the old gentleman by the collar, and the feminine occupants of the coach fully believed that some terrible catastrophe was about to occur. They besought Tom to have patience for a few moments, and then they feU upon Mr. Bumpus ; and, in a few seconds, rifled him of a pocket book, purse, a watch and seals, two rings, and a breast-pin. \" What may that be ?\" * Jonathan WUd. Ha, ha !\" The ladies all screamed ; for Wild's evil reputa tion was beginning to be a matter of town's talk ; and drawing near, as he was, towards the end of his terrible career, his very name carried with it an undefined terror. Mr. Bumpus, however, was so angry at the loss of his property, that he was glad even of the alliance with such a man as Jonathan WUd. \"I can assure you, Mr. WUd,\" he said, \"that the vUlain is an unheard-of viUain ; and that it was only by the greatest firmness I saved my Use.\" All these they handed to Tom, who was quite delighted at his success. \" Ladies,\" he said, \" I have the honour to wish you good night, aud it is very satisfactory to me that I have not been under the necessity of rob bing you ; for at any time you will be able to state that everything I take away has been freely given to me by your own fair hands.\" Tom leapt from the coach, and having re gained the road, he glanced up at the coachman, who sat upon the box in a bewUdered kind of way, scarcely able to understand how what he called his \"osses\" had gone off without the vehicle. \" That's not true !\" cried aU the ladies. \" Ho might have killed you, but let you go.\" \" Very good,\" said Mr. Bumpus. \" That only confirms me in my previous suspicions, that you are all of you in league with the highwayman ; and I feel inclined to give every one of you into custody for helping him to rob me !\" \" We in league with him ! We help to rob you, you odious old wretch. Take that, aud that and that !\" \" Murder ! \" \" Good night, Samuel,\" said Tom. \"Bless us!\" said the coachman; \"he knows my name, too!\" Tom laughed, for of course it was but a guess ; and then, making the best of his way to where he had left Daisy, he sprung lightly upon her back. \" We'll teach you to say we are in league with highwaymen.\" \"Help! help! Mr. WUd, help! I'm being scratched to death.\" Jonathan Wild took not the slightest notice of the disturbance within the coach, but riding quietly up to the side of it, he spoke to the coachman. At the moment he did so he heard the gallop ing of a horse upon the road. \" Tell me,\" he said, \" what sort of fellow it was who stopped you ?\" Bending low in the saddle, Tom Ustened, iu order to assure himself from which direction the horse was coming, as he fully intended to take the other. \" A young chap in a scarlet coat, on a very dark bay horse.\" \"I guessed it,\" said Wild; \"that's the fellow.\" \" You know him, Mr. WUd ? \" It was from the country that the horse was evidently rapidly approaching ; and as Tom glanced about him, he, upon second thoughts, considered it would be better to make his way into a field which was close at hand, and which was only divided from the roadway by a gate. Tho gate yielded to a touch, and Tom quietly walked Daisy into the field, closing it again be hind him. \" Perfectly. Which way did he go ? \" \" No way, it appeared to me, and my idea is that he is lurking about the spot here.\" \" Ah ! Say you so ? We wUl soon unearth that fox.\" Jonathan Wild wheeled his horse round, and took as accurate an observation as he could of the trees and hedges about the shadowy spot. Now Tom Eipon had heard the whole of this, and he had no desire to come into personal colli sion with Jonathan Wild. The horseman came up at a hand gallop. \" Hilloa !\" he cried. \" What's all this ? Clear the way here! Is the King's highway to be blocked up in this fashion?\" From tho abundance of his ingenuity he hit"], [211, "205 EDITH HEU0N. i upon a plan which he thought would have tho effect of throwing Wild off the scent. It was a feasible one, although Uablo to failure. Situated on the other side of the hedge as Tom was, he was on rather higher ground than the roadway. Daisy had had but Uttle work to do, and seemed rather anxious for a gallop. \" Let me see;\" said Tom, \" where am I exactly ? Surely I can get down by some cross way to the Kensington Eoad, for I don't haU like dodging Jonathan WUd about this one.\" That circumstance gave him an advantage for the execution of the Uttle project he intended to carry out. Tom's face was towards London, and therefore he knew that towards his right hand he was to look for the route he wanted. He took one of the pistols from Daisy's saddle, and poising it weU iu his hand by the ban-el, he flung it right over the road into the fields on the other side. He soon reached the mouth of one of those narrow lanes, with taU shadowy trees on each side, which are so common in that part of the country. Now Tom knew, from having frequently tried the experiment in the environs of Epping Forest, that a pistol so flung in nine cases out of ten would go off upon reaching the ground. The present percussion pistols might be thus flung with impunity, particularly if they alighted upon soft ground ; and whereas the chances were nine out of ten in favour of the explosion of the \" This will do,\" said Tom ; \" and now good night, Jonathan WUd, I hope, for the present.\" Tom trotted Daisy down the lane, and it was evident by the softness of the turf that it was a very little frequented one. There was a feeling of intense silence and solitude about it which was not at all suitable to Tom's gay and somewhat volatile disposition. \"I don't haU like this place,\" he said, \"and I wish I was well out of it.\" old flint and steel fire-arms, the calculation would now probably be exactly reversed. The pistol went clearly over the hedge on the \u2022other side of the road. These words had hardly passed his Ups when he was startled by a piercing scream. He reined up Daisy so suddenly that she stood for a few seconds upon her hind feet, no doubt presenting, with Tom on her back, a very artistic looking group, U they could have been fixed in that position. \" Good gracious !\" exclaimed Tom. \" What's that ?\" There was an instant's anxious expectation on the part of Tom Eipon. Then carae the report. Loud and startUng. The ladies in the coach screamed, and sus- pended their attack upon Mr. Bumpus, who, fall ing against the coach door, burst it open, and rolled into tbe road. There was but the one scream, but its echoes appeared to Tom to fill the air for the full space of a minute before they died completely away. The coachman shrank down on his coach-box, as if the bullet were speciaUy auned at him and there was yet time to avoid it. Then the intense stUlness of the lane seemed to return with double force, and Tom felt a creeping sensation of affright, such as very seldom came over him. \" There he is !\" cried WUd. \" Now I know where the rascal is in hiding ! That shot was meant for me, but a miss is as good as a mile !\" WUd immediately rode to the other side of the roadway, where there was a somewhat simUar gate to the one which Tom Eipon had passed through. CHAPTEB CCXLVIII. Jonathan was weU mounted, for he put his horse to the gate and leapt it. \" That'U do,\" said Tom ; \" he's on a false scent now, and I may as well be eff.\" Tom did not think it desirable to make his way into the road, but he trotted quietly along the meadows, now and then leaping Daisy across a Uttle streamlet ; for that part of the country lay rather low, and was intersected by numerous tribu taries of the Uttle Eiver Brent, so weU known by the picturesque aspect it imparts to many miles of country in that direction from London. \" Well,\" said Tom, as he emerged into the road again through a wide gap in the hedgerow, \" I think I get on famously. This is the way to for tune ; and if the Captain will but let me have the use of Daisy for a year, I shaU be able to give a capital account of my adventures on the road.\" Tom was anxious to know what the time was, and looked at Mr. Bumpus's watch as well as he could in the dim night light. He had to light a match, however, in order to see it for it was one of those watches with a gold face, which only show up in a good Ught \" HaU-past eleven,\" said Tom. \" Time enough, and plenty to spare, for some good sport yet. What do you think of it, Daisy ?\" TOM'S adventure in THE LANE. \u2014 THE SOVEREIGN PRINCESS. It was so- a few seconds before Tom could make up his min'. to proceed. Then keeping a tight hold of the rein, he let Daisy go forward at a walk, for he seemed to consider that the quieter he was, as he made his way out of that lane, would be aU the better. But he had not proceeded above five or six paces, when he was startled again by a voice. \"Hist, hist! Stop, iUustrious stranger, and listen to the woes of a Sovereign Princess.\" \" A what ?\" said Tom. \" The wearer of a diadem,\" repeated the veice. \" The wearer of a what ?\" \" Oh, pause, and render what aid you may to one who should sit upon a throne !\" \" That's all very weU,\" said Tom ; \" but where are you sitting now? I don't see you any where, high or low.\" \" Noble and Ulustrious stranger, I am in this tree.\" \" Oh !\" \" And I need but your friendly aid to descend it, and resume my proper state and dignity as a Sovereign Princess.\""], [212, "EDITH HERON. 206 \" I am escaping from this gloomy fortress. I may find some pretender on the throne ; but you shall challenge him to mortal combat, and then, when victorious, to whom am I to give my hand but to the gallant knight who has been my cham pion and my preserver ?\" \" What on earth does she mean ?\" said Tom. \" A gaUant knight and a champion !\" The lane was very dark, but Tom's eyes were young and good, and by looking sharply about him, he saw that to his left hand there was a hi^h, ancient-looking brick wall with a stone coping, over which projected the branches of a hugh sycamore tree, from amid which Tom thought the voice of the Sovereign Princess seemed to come. \" Are you up there ?\" said Tom. \" I am, noble stranger.\" \" But what are you doing there, and who are you, really?\" \" I am the Princess Marabella !\" \"Yes,\" added the lady in the tree; \"it wUl need but the flash of your well-tried sword, and aU will be well.\" Tom was about to reply, when again the Sove reign Princess gave a half-scream. \" Why, what's the matter now ?\" said Tom. \" I thought \u2014 I thought,\" repUed the Princess, \" that I saw the dragon flying through the air, and that he was about to dart at thy raven locks and tear thee from my side !\" \"The deuce you did!\" said Tom. And he looked anxiously around him, to see if he could perceive anything of his much-dreaded foe, Jona than WUd. \" You don't say so !\" \" But, before we proceed further, tell me \u2014 are you noble ?\" \" Of course I am !\" said Tom. \" That is satisfactory,\" said the Princess. \" I can see that you are mounted on a war-steed. How many quarterings have you in your shield ?\" \" WeU I don't know,\" said Tom, \" There's my own four quarters here, and there's Daisy's quarters, hind and front, and that makes six ; but I'm not aware of a shield just at present !\" \" Perhaps your squire has it, along with your helm and vizor.\" \" What did you say, gallant knight ?\" \"Nothing.\" \" Oh ! Approach nearer, and let me seat my seU beside you, illustrious stranger, and we will speed over hiU and deU until we arrive at my dominions, where you, my preserver, shall share my heart, my throne, my aU !\" \" Very kind,\" said Tom to himseU, \" but I do not haU liko it. I shaU cut it short. If, now, I could manage to get hold of some of the Prin cess's jewellery, Hem!\" said Tom. \" Did you speak, Sir Marmaduke ?\" \" Sir Marmaduke ! Oh, I forgot! Yes, lovely Princess. Do you not think you had better hand over the waU some of your precious ornaments \u2014 your bracelets, your ear-rings, and such like, and let me secure them safely in a secret pocket I have ; and then you can just give a Uttle jump into my arms when I say the word ?\" \" Alas !\" replied the Sovereign Princess ; \" when I was carried off from my home, around which waved the tall trees, in the branches of which carolled birds of every hue and colour \u2014 I say, when I was borne forcibly from my home to this fortified castle \" \" I shouldn't wonder!\" said Tom. \" Approach closer, illustrious knight, and I will descend into your arms. I have dreamt of this, many a time, and all has now brought about my most ardent wishes !\" \" I rather think,\" thought Tom, \" that I have dreamed about it, too ; for if I'm really awake, this is the oddest thing that ever happened to me!\" \" Speak, illustrious knight,\" said the lady in the t ee. \" Let me again hear your gallant voice.\" \"Here you are !\" said Tom. \" Approach closer, aud I will drop into your friendly grasp.\" \" I hope you're a light weight,\" said Tom. \" But before we get any better acquainted, U it's all tho same to you, I should Uke to know what it's all about.\" \" One question more, Sir Marmaduke !\" \" Sir who ?\" \" Sir Marmaduke of the lion crest !\" \" Hush !\" said Tom, \" What's that ?\" \" Oh, that's me !\" said Tom. \" The same to you, ma'am, and many of 'em.\" At this moment, the murmur of voices was borne upon the night air ; but the sound was at too great a distance for Tom to distinguish any words. \" Do you come from Palestine ?\" \" What the deuce does she mean ?'' said Tom. \" Perhaps that's her way of saying Pall MaU. It won't do to be stupid. Yes, yes \u2014 I come from there !\" \" It is the voice of my gaoler !\" said the Princess. \" The voice of who ?\" \" Did you meet a dragon on your way ?\" \"A dragon?\" \" Yes ! Tell me, iUustrious knight !\" \" By Jove, she means Jonathan WUd ! He*s the only dragon I know. Yes, I met a dragon ; but I rather think he's gone on a wild goose chase now, for I was one too many for him.\" \" That is well. Now let me descend.\" \" My implacable gaoler !\" \" Gaoler ?\" \"Even so. The voice of him who rifled me of aU my possessions when ho confined me within these walls ; but, thank heaven, my deUverer has come at last !\" Tom could not, for the Use of him, understand what to make of aU this, and he was about to bid the Sovereign Princess farewell, when the sound of voices again attracted his attention. \" We have searched everywhere, if you please, sir,\" said a voice evidently belonging to an old woman, \" and can find no traces of her I\" \" Have you searched the grounds ?\" At this moment, Tom was startled on feehng something strike his arm, and fearing that the Tom was rather at a loss to know what to do, and before he placed himseU and Daisy exactly beneath the sycamore tree, he thought he would like to know a Uttlo more about the Sovereign Princess. \"Perhaps you don't mind explaining,\" said Tom, \" what's amiss, and how you came to be perched up there ?\""], [213, "I i 207 EDITH HERON. cious ! just fancy a Sovereign Princess taking snuff ! Good night, all of you ! I am in a hurry ; and when I see you again, my Sovereign Princess, I will not forget your little weakness in the shape of tobacco.\" Tom trotted Daisy briskly out of the narrow lane, and was once more on the high road. The lane terminated in the Kensington Boad, carrying Tom, as he imagined, so entirely clear of the scene of his recent exploits, that there was no danger of his encountering any one to chal lenge him concerning them. But it was stUl sufficiently early in the night to look, at all events, for one other adventure before he should make his way to Wardour Street to dispose of his booty. That adventure was not long in coming. Just as Tom was emerging from the end of the shadowy lane, an open chaise, in which were seated a lady and gentleman, was driven towards its entrance, evidently with the intention of taking that route into the Western Boad. By the sUght glance Tom caught at the occu pants of the chaise, he saw that the gentleman was a very stout specimen of humanity, with fiery red whiskers, and a face that very nearly emulated them in colour. Sovereign Princess had commenced a descent which would land her on the back of Daisy, he retreated a few paces. \" Hist !\" said the voice of the Princess. \" Do you not hear them ?\" and, with the branch of the tree on which she was sitting, she struck Tom a not very light blow on the side of the head. \" I can feel, and no mistake,\" cried Tom. \"Hold hard ! What are you doing, belabouring a feUow in that kind of way ?\" \" Hist !\" again said the Princess. The voices by this time seemed to be beneath the very tree in which was seated the Princess ; and Tom could not control the curiosity he felt at that moment to hear more of this strange ad venture. \" Search every tree,\" said the voice again of one who seemed to be in authority, \u2014 \" search every tree ; but be careful not to startle the poor creature.\" \" Oh, oh !\" said Tom. \" More mysteries yet ! I should think a young and lovely Princess, who has been begging of me for the last quarter of an hour to take her with me, is not in much danger of being startled.\" At this moment there was a tramp as of many feet ; and by the flickering light which came from a lantern carried by one of these persons, Tom could just catch a glimpse now and then of a figure seated in one of tho topmost boughs of the tree. The lady Tom could see but Uttle of. That little, however, led him to the conclusion that she was very young, and that she was labouring under some very extraordinary agita tion. This figure appeared to Tom to be enveloped in what appeared to be an immense counterpane, put on in the shape of a shawl ; whUe in her hair the fair and lovely Princess wore sundry pieces of sticks, and paper ornaments, which had evidently been cut out with a pair of scissors to represent crowns, and pendants, and feathers. \" There she is ! There she is ! \" burst simul taneously from several voices; and in a few minutes a ladder was placed against tho wall, and a man's head was seen above the wall. The necessity of driving slow on entering the narrow lane made the wheels of the chaise almost pass noiselessly over the gravelly road. Tom was therefore enabled to hear that the young lady by the side of the pretentious man with the red whiskers was crying audibly. \" I should Uke to know what's the matter,\" thought Tom ; \" and I don't see why I shouldn't. either.\" Tom was about to ride up to the side of the chaise and address its occupants, when he was saved the trouble by the man with the red whis kers speaking to him first. \"Hilloa, you sir! \u2014 hilloa!\" he cried. \"Does this lane lead into the Western Boad ?\" \" Who are you ? \" asked the voice, addressing Tom. \" Ah ! My preserver ! \" cried the Princess. \"My gallant prince, who with his- war steed has come to deliver me from this castle !\" \"Perhaps, sir,\" said the man \u2014 who, as Tom could not make up his mind what to say at the moment, again addressed him \u2014 \" perhaps, sir, you wore kind enough to wish to give an alarm, when you found this poor unhappy lady trying to make her escape ? \" \" Not I. She asked me to help her, and I was just considering what I had best do ; for the idea of a young and lovely girl being shut up a prisoner \" \" Is it possible, sir, that you do not know this to be Ashton House, a private lunatic asylum ? And this is one of our patients \u2014 an old lady over sixty years of age, and who has lately got it into her head that she is a princess, or something of \"What's that to you?\" cried Tom, who win not at all pleased at the manner in which the question had been asked. \" Don't answer me in that way, you scoundrel, or I'll lay my whip over your shoulders. I'm a plain man, and ask you a plain question.\" \" I see you're a plain man,\" said Tom, \" and something more, for I should say you were down right ugly.\" \" Insolence ! how dare you ?\" \" Easily,\" said Tom, whose temper was a little aroused by this cavalier treatment on the part of a perfect stranger. \"Easily; and U you don't Uko it, here's something more !\" Tom clapped the muzzle of a pistol against the rubicund cheek of the man with the red whiskers. that sort.\" \"Good gracious,\" said Tom; \"what an escape 1 \" Now, sir,\" added Tom ; \" who are you that call the first person you meet on the highway a feUow ?\" A lunatic ! \" \" Indeed it is, sir! Now, Mrs. Appleby, come down quietly, and nothing wUl be said to you for giving us all this fright. Come in \u2014 come in, and you shall have a double quantity of snuff to-morrow if you are good.\" \" Snuff !\" said Tom to himseU. \" Good gra- The man opened his mouth Uke some fish newly stranded, and not knowing what to make of ths quantity of air he was gulping down instead of water."], [214, "208 EDITH HERON. \"Murder!\" But it sounded suspicious. \" WeU,\" said Tom, as he looked down the lane, \" You may call it so, U you please, but I con sider it only a little bit of justifiable man slaughter.\" \" Who \u2014 who are you ?\" \" How can you ask, when you know quite weU ?\" and heard the rapidly retreating sounds of the chaise, \u2014 \"well, I suppose it's all right, and it's best not to interfere. Every mile that that young girl gets on to Dover will be some weight off her heart. Dover! Hem \u2014 Dover! Let me see! Why it's the contrary direction. They're going north, and Dover lies south.\" \" I \u2014 I know quite well ?\" \" Yes ; you said I was a fellow, and I am one.\" Tom felt his heart begin to beat rapidly, and a flush came over his face, as now he felt certain something was amiss, and that interference was more than justifiable. \" Forward, Daisy,\" he cried ; \" on \u2014 on !\" Daisy crouched down for a moment as though she was about to lie flat upon the earth, and then, obeying the impulse of voice and gesture which Tom gave her, she set off down the lane in one of those terrific bounding gaUops which nothing could surpass. The young lady was too much terrified to weep now ; and stretching out a small, deUcate baud, she laid it upon Tom's sleeve as she spoke to him. \" Oh, do not \u2014 do not kill my uncle !\" \" Your uncle ?\" said Tom. \" Yes. He may not be quite so \u2014 so kind as I would wish him, but do not loll him.\" By the lights of the chaise, Tom looked at the young lady, and then at the man with the red whiskers, in no small surprise. He could not believe that there was anything approaching affinity between those two persons. And, but that they belonged to the same species, and were unmistakably specimens of the human family, no two creatures could be more dissimilar. The chaise had got about a mile ahead, but Tom passed it Uke an arrow from a bow. \" Woa, Daisy, woa ! Woo, lass !\" With some difficulty Tom moderated the speed of Daisy, and then suddenly wheeling round, he met the chaise and its occupants face to face. The young lady screamed with terror, for Tom's conduct now looked so decidedly ag gressive that she might weU dread some catas trophe. \" I don't beUeve it,\" said Tom. \" He's no uncle of vours.\" \" Oh, yes \u2014 yes ! he says he is ; and I pray you not to delaj' us ; for he is taking me to my father, who lies at the point of death, at Dover ; and should I arrive too late to receive his blessing a_d last caress, the thought would be an affliction to me through lUe.\" \" Yes,\" growled the man with the red whiskers, \"that's about, it. You hear what the young lady says, so get out of the way.\" \"But you don't mean to say you are going to drive down to Dover in this rattle-trap?\" in quired Tom. \" Yes, we are ; and why not ? We can easUy get change of horses on the way !\" \" Very well \u2014 I can't help it ; and for your sake, my dear, I shall let this insolent old cur mudgeon go.\" \" Oh, thank you !\" said the young lady ; \" mo ments may be precious.\" \" Then be off,\" said Tom. \" I was going to ask you for a kiss, but that would be mean, be cause you couldn't refuse it. Good night ; and I hope you'll find the old 'un better.\" It was a great relief to the man with the red whiskers to be relieved from such close conti guity to Tom's pistol. The man with the red whiskers stood up in the chaise, and held his whip threateningly. \"Halt!\" cried Tom. \" I must have something more to say to you before we part.\" CHAPTEE CCXLIX. TOM NARROWLY ESCAPES A PISTOL BULLET. \u2014 HE MAKES AN AGREEABLE ACQUAINTANCE. The man in the chaise evidently considered now that affans were getting serious. From a capacious pocket of his over-coat, he produced a pair of pistols, both of which he levelled at Tom. \"Now, my fine fellow,\" he said, \"here's one for you, and one for your horse, and you may both Ue and rot by the roadside together. I give you one minute to get out of my way, and U you are wise you will take the opportunity.\" \" Only a minute ?\" said Tom. \"That's all.\" \" Then there's no time for nonsenso.\" He passed on down the lane, growUng as he went. Tom turned Daisy's head to the right hand side of tho road, still advancing, and then touching her lightly both on neck and flank, ho made her execute a trick which he had often taught her in the old forest. But Tom did not feel satisfied; and, as he heard the horse in the chaise quickening its pace, so that the frail vehicle behind it proceeded at a kind of rush, that in a little time would be posi tively dangerous, he felt more and more dissatis fied with himseU that he had allowed the man to proceed without further questioning. The young'lady had used an expression which Tom now recollected, and wondered he had not taken more notice of at the time. It was to execute a sidelong leap which at once placed her somewhat further in advance still, but completely on the other side of the lane. Bang ! bang ! went the two pistols of the man in the chaise. But they were both fired to the right, and were so far from Tom, that they might as well have been discharged in tho opposite direction, so far as regarded any likelihood of doing him injury. \" That'll do,\" cried Tom. \" Now it's all plain sailing. Open your mouth, old fellow.\" Who had stated that the man with the red whiskers said he was hpr uncle. What could she mean by that ? Perhaps it was only an accidental expression."], [215, "EDITH HERON. 209 \"Help! Murder!\" \" There's no help ; and as for murder, it might have you been acquainted with this precious uncle of yours ?\" have been ; and that it is not, is from no good wUl of yours.\" Tom, with very little ceremony, thrust the muzzle of his pistol right between the teeth of the man with the red whiskers. \" Perhaps an hour.\" \" An hour ! And how came you to know him ?\" \" He came to the school at Hammersmith, and persuaded Miss Le Plomb to let me come away \u25a0with him, as my father was dying at Dover, and wished to give me his lost blessing !\" \" His last fiddle-stick !\" said Tom. \" Hark you !\" said Tom; \"there's only one thing you have said that I reaUy don't like ; aU the rest has been fair enough; and you might shoot me U you liked, \u2014 but what did you mean by saying there was one for my horse ?\" \" Murder ! \u2014 .help ! \u2014 spare my Use ! You are not going to kill me on account of a dumb beast ?\" \" A dumb beast ! CaU Daisy a dumb beast ? Just suy that again, wUl you ?\" \" I won't, U you don't like it\" \" I think you'd better not. And now, my dear,\" added Tom, turning to the young lady, \" answer me, and I am sure it wiU be truly. How long \" Oh ! do not be unfeeling, but let us go.\" \" I don't mean to be unfeeling, but I don't mean to let you go ! Now, old feUow, I'm only anxious about one point Are you sure you know your way to Dover?*' \" Perfectly.\" \" You have been before ?\" \" Often\u2014 often !\" \" Then that's conclusive,\" said Tom. \" For this is exactly the contrary direction. My dear, what's your name ?\" No. 79 \u2014 Edith."], [216, "210 EDITH HERON. And during that short space of time which elapsed, while neither Tom nor the young lady spoke a word, he was able, by the light of the chaise lamps, to take a good look at her. Tom Eipon fell desperately in love at once. We are aware of the susceptibility of Tom to female beauty, and that upon more than one oc casion he had believed himself enamoured past redemption ; but the really singular loveUness of this young girl transcended anything he had ever seen before. \".Marian Annesley.\" \" And what's yours ?\" \" Mine ? Why, mine is \u2014 is \u2014 is \u2014 is \u2014 that is to say, I am \" \" One of the reddest-whiskered, impudent scoundrels in all the world !\" \" Oh, what do you mean ?\" said the young lady. \" What am I to think ?\" \" Think just what you like,\" said Tom. \" But the fact is, this man's no more your uncle than I am\u2014 perhaps not so much.\" \" That's false !\" cried the man with the red whiskers. In a few short seconds all his previous predilec tions were forgotten, and Tom registered a men tal vow that henceforth that young lady in the chaise was to be the empress of his heart. What she thought of Tom it is hard to say. '\u2022 Stop' a kit,\" said Tom, \" and we'll find that out. Of course, my dear, you know your father well V' \" I have not seen him for two years, since which time he has been a foreign consul ; but of course tefc&ow him well. He is \" . But love may exist without reciprocity. And, to tell the truth, Tom cut rather a grotesque appearance, for the suit of clothes he had borrowed or purchased, at his mother's fence in Wardour Street were somewhat too large for him. \" StoJ) !\" cried Tom. \" Now, old cafrots, do you know him weU 7\" \" My own brother? Of course I do.\" \" Very well ; describe him.\" \" B_!\u2014 -&8 is \u2014 something Uke me ; not quite so stout, but a family likeness, you see.\" \"WiU that do, my dear ?\" said Tom. \" Oh. no, no ! My father is particularly dark, and rathe* Slender.\" The gold-6mbroi_er*d- caffs had a propensity to come down too low ; and the collar, as if to make up for that little redundancy, went up too high. But still there was as ingenuous sparkle about Tom's eyes, and the tones of his voice were pleasant. \" A slight difference,\" said Tom. \" How dare you go <\u00bb ia this kind of way, eh?\" Tote took the pistol-barrel oat (of the mouth of the p__t____fc4 uncle, and knocking off his hat, dealt him two or three hard raps on she head with the stock of it. His youth, too, no doubt, recommended him to the young girl, and she felt that seft of compa nionship of early lUe which, had Tom been K_n years older, she would have shrunk from con templating. The silence Was getting awkward, and Tom broke it by saying, \" What a lucky thing it was I came up this lane ! And yet no, I don't thrak that exactly.\" The young girl looked at him with an inquir ing air, as though she would have asked what was the meaning of that contradiction. Tom answered her without troubUng her to speak. \"ton see,\" said Tom, \"lucky as it looks/ I think ft was to be. You may depend upon it it was a kind of fate.\" \"Murder! \u201e__**__!\" \" It's very lifcely ; but are you going toroafess now?\" \"Confess what?\" \" Who and what you are.\" \" My name is Jotoes. Don't crack in the top of my skull, and I WUl tell you aU.\" \" Are you this yoang lady's uncle ?\" \" No.\" \" That's enough ; we don t want to know any more. Get out.\" \" But it's my chaise.\" \" Get out, I say !\" \" Fate ?\" said the young girl, with a look of interest. The man with the red whiskers rolled out of the chaise. \" Now,\" said Tom, \" I'U give you a start of about a hundred yards, and then I mean to blaze away. Be off, and make the best of it.\" \"Murder! help! fire! thieves!\" shouted the man with the red whiskers, as he fled along the lane at a speed no one would have thought him capable of. Bang ! went one of Tom's pistols after him. Then, believing himBelf hit, he fell, and rolled into a ditch, where he floundered about and roared for mercy like gome gigantic tadpole. \" My dear,\" said Tom to the young lady, \" you have had a narrow escape. Heaven only knows what danger this man would have taken you into.\" \" Yes, Marian,\" said Tom ; \" affairs of this im portance don't happen quite on the loose.\" The young girl might have been a Uttle puzzled, considering her previous education, at the phraseology of Tom ; but she was quite aware that he had called her Marian, and a flush, half of pleasure and haU of surprise, came across her face. She was in the romantic period of early life, when, to a total ignorance of the real world in which she had to Uve, was superadded those ro mantic notions concerning it that were only to be acquired at that period from the shelves of the circulating library. Of course, she felt that Tom had done her a signal service, and that was a recommendation which would go far to make him look handsome, assuming that he had been quite the reverse. Without the least abUity to decide upon who and what he was, she began in her own mind to liken him to some of the heroes of the romances with which her head was tolerably well crammed The sudden revulsion of feehng that had taken place in the mind of Marian Annesley nearly de prived her of sensation. She could not speak to Tom for several mi nutes ; but with clasped hands and a face as pale as death itself, sho regarded him with an expression of infinite thankfulness."], [217, "211 EDITH HERON. \" I am afraid,\" she said, \"I ought not to let you call me Marian.\" \" Don't be afraid of anything in aUthe world,\" was the prompt reply, \" as long as I'm here. You may caU me Tom, U you like.\" \"Tom?\" The distance was not great, and the young lady pointed out a garden-wall, and an iron gate with stone supports, as the establishment of Mr. Goldwinkle, from which she had been cajoled by the pretended uncle. \" There is my home,\" she said ; \" and I know not how to thank you for your noble conduct towards me.\" \" Yes, that's my name\"' \" It would be too familiar ; I might say Mr. Thomas, and then add your surname.\" \" Not at all,\" said Tom; \"call me Tom, and nothing else. But, now teU me where you want to go, and I'll take you without the slightest danger.\" \" Oh, yes!\" exclaimed the young lady, clasping her hands, and no doubt suddenly remembering that she ought to go home to the school at Hammersmith as quickly as possible, \u2014 \" oh, yes ! take me back again at once. There will be a world of anxiety on my accouut.\" \" Oh, no !\" said Tom ; \" they wUl think you're half-way to Dover by this time, and your coming back will be a surprise.\" The young girl had forgotten, and now she smUed with an appearance of more composure ; for, after all, no one was'suffering on her account, and she felt a sensation of great relief from the reflection that the story about her father's imminent danger was false. \"You are quite right, Mr. \u2014 Mr. Tom,\" she said; \"but still I would fain return at once, for I have suffered much anxiety and some regret.\" \" All right !\" said Tom. \" It's at Hammersmith, isn't it ?\" Tom sighed. \" I don't know either,\" he said. \" That is to say, I don't want any thanks at aU ; hut I should like to be able to think that I could see you again.\" Marian Annesley now sighed as she replied faintly, \" That is impossible.\" \" How impossible ?\" \" None but relations are allowed to visit us.\" \" Can't you say I'm a sort of haU and half cousin, or something of that sort ?\" Marian shook her head. \" No \u2014 no ; it is not possible. It must not be thought of. Farewell now, and chance only can ever let us see each other again ; but be assured that I shaU never forget \" \" Me ?\" interposed Tom. \" I was going to say that I shall never forget the service you have done me this night. And. therefore, remembering that service, it is im possible that I should whoUy forget you.\" \" WeU,\" said Tom, \" it can't be helped ; but if I don't manage, in some sort of way, to see you again, my name is not Tom Eipon.\" \"Eipon?\" \" Yes, that's my other name ; but U ever you hear of a certain old gal in Wardour Street, mind I've no connexion with that party.\" Tom rang at the iron gates as he spoke, and Marian leaped from the chaise. The progress of a light from the house, carried by some one down the garden-path, warned him that he must soon bid adieu to the fair young creature .who carried away his heart in her keeping. \" Yes. It is Mrs. Goldwinkle's estabUsh ment.\" \" Goldwinkle !\" thought Tom: \"what a name !\" And then he added aloud, \"I'U get into the chaise, and we wiU drive there together.\" \" But your horse ?\" \" Oh, Daisy will foUow.\" \" And so your horse's name is Daisy ; and the creature is so sagacious and fond of you, that you reaUy think it wiU foUow us ?\" \" I'm quite sure of it,\" said Tom, \" and you'll soon see the fact. Now, Daisy, lass, on we go.\" Tom dismounted, and got into the chaise ; and as he did so, the rather preposterous size of the unUorm-coat he wore could not fail to attract Marian's attention. \" Marian !\" he said. And he spoke huskily. \"Yes, Mr. Tom?\" \" Did that rascal with the red whiskers, pre- suming upon the fact that you thought him your uncle, kiss you ?\" \" Kiss me \u2014 no !\" \" Oh, Marian!\" \" What do you mean, Mr. Tom ?\" \" I thought the villain had, for there's a bright spot just upon that cheek next me.\" \"No!\" \" I think you are in disguise,\" she said. \" No,\" said Tom ; \" but this is an uniform that I've been compelled to adopt on tbe spur of a moment, and it don't fit me so weU as it might. At all events, my dear Marian, it did not have the effect of hindering me in any way, from saving you from that rascal, yonr pretended uncle.\" The young girl now felt quite ashamed that she had taken any notice of whether the coat of her gallant deUverer fitted him or not. Tom stooped over the side of the chaise, and Marian held up her cheek to let him see that the bright spot was not there ; but it soon made its appearance, for Tom bestowed upon the fair cheek a couple of hearty kisses, that, in the silence of the night, and of that spot, were heard by the person with the light, who was approach ing to open the gate. \" Gracious providence ! What's that 7\" Marian uttered a slight scream. CHAPTEE CCL. \" It's nothing,\" said Tom. \" Nothing ?\" cried the person with the light \" I'm certain that's a he voice, and I'm sure I heard \" TOM SAFFX.Y DEPOSITS THE YOUNG LADY AT THE ESTABLISHMENT* AT HAMMERSMITH. Daisy's sagacity by no means behed Jones's de scription of it since she trotted after the chaise without the slightest hesitation, or showing the smallest disposition to diverge from the road. \" What ?\" cried Tom. \" Go away, you villain, whoever you are. I won't say what I heard.\""], [218, "212 EDITH HERON. \" It was only a blunderbuss,\" said Tom. \" So good night!\" narrow escape of an encounter with Jonathan Wild, under tho very worst circumstances that could possibly have occurred. He touched the horse in the chaise with the extreme end of the whip, and in five minutes Tom was haU a mUe from Mrs. Goldwinkle's establishment. In the chaiso he would have stood but little chance; and Tom, for the moment, felt sick at heart at the idea that if WUd had come out him self from the lane, both he and Daisy might have been captured. Daisy followei. him at a smart trot, and then Tom began to wonder what he could do next ; and the idea just occurred to him that among tho singular pieces of booty he had acquired that night was a horse and chaise. They-might be useful. Tom drew up, and began to consider the posture of affairs. \"This won't do,\" said Tom, \"and shan't do any longer.\" He drew up to the roadside, and jumped out of the chaise, with the intention of abandoning his prize, and trotting off alone, upon Daisy. A new idea, however, took possession of Tom, and he thought he might as well ride Daisy, and stUl bring the chaise behind him. At any moment he could disengage the ex temporized traces, and gallop off. This was a plan of operations that got Tom entirely over his difficulty ; and the appearance he, Daisy, and the chaise and horse exhibited now was that of rather au eccentric conveyance, driven by a postilion. \" What shall I do next ?\" he said. \" It's get ting towards morning. I wonder if the old gal and Mortification wUl take ia a horse and chaise as a bit of swag. They can't put them in the melting-pot, that's for certain. I wonder what o'clock it is ? I fancy the night's pretty well spent, and we shall have daylight perhaps in another hour. I will drive on to Wardour Street, at all events, for I think I have had enough of it to night. Come, Daisy, suppose we go on another plan. I dare say you can trot first, and we can get to town in good style. By dint of a good deal of rummaging about in the chaise, Tom found some spare reins, and with considerable ingenuity he contrived to as sociate Daisy with the vehicle, tandem fashion. \" On we go, now !\" said Tom. \" We shall get over the ground in capital style.\" Daisy was quite agreeable to any arrangement Tom chose, and the only eccentricity she was guilty of was now and then turning right round, and looking the other horse right in the face, as though she very much wondered what he was doing there. The empty chaise rattled on for about a quarter of a mUe, aud then Tom suddenly checked its progress, for he felt certain he heard the clatter of horses' feet behind him. He was on a portion of the road where there wa_? no turning to the right or to the left, so he had no resource but to abandon the chaise at once, or to drive onwards as quickly as pos sible. But yet he did not wish to act hastUy, since it might be that the horseman on the road was some stranger, who would take no notice of him. Tom, however, adopted a precaution, in order to conceal his identity. He took off the rather large uniform coat he wore, and flung it into the chaise. This produced occasionally a little confusion in Tom's driving; but notwithstanding, the Western Boad was soon reached again, and Tom was trotting up the descent by Notting HiU, when from one of the side lanes there emerged a horse man. In his waistcoat and shirt-sleeves, Tom looked much more like a postUion than he had done before. He extinguished the chaise lamps Ukewise, so that but a very dim view could be got of the vehicle or its horses. \" Halt !\" cried a rough voice. . Tom pulled up. The voice was strange to him, and therefore he had no particular reason to avoid its owner. \" Have you come far up the road, sir ?\" \" Across from Hammersmith,\" said Tom. \"Hoy! hoy! HUloa, there! Stop! \" shouted a voice ; and the same horseman who a short time before had spoken to Tom, gaUoped up to the side of the chaise. \" Have you seeu a fellow on a dark bay mare, with a scarlet coat?\" \"Halt!\" cried the myrmidon of Jonathan Wild \u2014 \" halt, or it wiU be worse for you.\" \" Very good,\" said Tom ; \" I am halting.\" \" Oh, I didn't see you before. You are the postUion ?\" \" I am.\" \" No,\" said Tom ; \" looking-glasses are scarce hereabouts.\" \" What do you say, sir ?\" \"\u25a0 I tell you what it is!\" cried Tom. \" When you speak to me again, please to say Major !\" \" I beg your pardon, sir \u2014 I mean Major \u2014 but I'm one of Mr. Wild's men, and we are on the look-out for a highwayman on this road.\" \" Oh, indeed !\" \" And where's your master ?\" \" Oh, he'll be here directly.\" \" Indeed ! Give me leave to say I very much doubt that. But perhaps you've no particular objection to tell me who he is ?\" \" None in the least,\" said Tom. \" He has paid mo very weU, and I don't expect anything more from him. He is a highwayman, if j .u must know, and his namo is Tom Bipon.\" \" Thank you !\" cried WUd's man. \" That's tho very thing wo wanted to find out ; and now, my fine fellow, U you want to earn a guinea, you will keep this chaise at the identical spot it at present 6tands in till I can bring Mr. Wild back.\" \" i'es, sir. But if you've not seeu him I'm sorry to have interrupted you \u2014 Major, I mean.\" The man then raised his voice aud shouted out. \" It you please, Mr. Wild, this gentleman, who i^ ii. Major, has not seen him.\" '\u2022 Lot him go to the deuce, then !\" growled WUd, who was in the shadow of the lane. \" Tbilisi; you,\" said Tom, as he trotted on, con usa. .n,g. un ho \"weU might, that he had had a"], [219, "213 EDITH HERON. \"Give us the guinea,\" said Tom, \" and 111 stake my lUe on it.\" \" There, then ; you won't find this the worst night's work you ever did.\" \" I don't think I shall,\" said Tom, as he coolly pocketed the guinea which Wild's man handed to him. as she slipped \u00a9ff her chair on to the floor, \" is it fire or police ?\" \" The Philistines ! \u2014 yea, the Philistines !\" said Mortification. As he spoke, he dived his hands into his pocket, and produced a silver mustard-pot and several spoons, with which he ran down into the lower regions of the house, in order that they might be cast at once into the melting-pot, and all traces of their separate existence obUterated. \" Don't make a row,\" said Tom. \" I'll go and see who it is.\" In another moment, Tom was alone with his two horses and the chaise ; but his fertile genius had already suggested what he had better do. Ho contrived to stick up the chaise-whip tolerably firmly in the vehicle, and then to but ton loosely round it the scarlet coat he had so recently thrown off, and fixing his hat above that, he succeeded in making a very fair representa tion, considering the darkness, of some one sitting in the chaise. Upon making his way into the shop, Tom heard the blows against the door still more dis tinctly ; and scrambling up to tbe fan-light, he took a careful observation through it. What was his astonishment to see the very identical chaise and horse he had left in thc Western Boad drawn up at bis mother's door, with Jonathan Wild standing up in the vehicle, and banging the upper panel of that door with the handle of the whip. \" That's clever ! \" said Tom. \" He knows a shorter way home than I did.\" AU Tom, then, had to do was to release Daisy from the whole concern ; and giving up without a pang the horse and chaise, which, after all, he would have found it very difficult to dispose of, he started with Daisy for London. Tom would fain have lingered to see what sort of reception Jonathan Wild gave to the sup posed figure in the chaise ; but he saw the first streaks of dawn in the east, and putting Daisy to speed, he was, in twenty minutes' time, in War dour Street. With all his admiration for Jonathan Wild's alertness, Tom Bipon felt the necessity of imme diate action, if he would save himseU from igno minious capture. He felt for the fastenings of the door, and, shooting another bolt into its socket, he ran back to the parlour. St. Martin's clock struck four. Tom hammered away at his mother's door, and Mortification, after making the usual espial from the fanlight above, admitted him. \" Yea, Thomas !\" he said. \" Even as manna in the wilderness art thou welcome to this little receptacle for property \u2014 hem ! \u2014 that has strayed from its owner.\" \" Mother,\" he said, \" and you, Mortification, it will do neither of you any good to see me fall into the hands of Jonathan Wild. I have some swag ; there it is. Take it and welcome, and make the most of it ; but don't, for both your Uves and mine too, let him know that I'm in the house, or Daisy either.\" \" It's a bad job,\" said Tom ; \" but I've got nothing. I lost my coat and hat.\" \" Yea, then, I can only liken thee to a howling reprobate ; and the sooner thou art hanged, Thomas, the better.\" \" Stuff ! Where's the old gal ?\" \" She sleepeth the sweet sleep of egg-flip.\" \" Oh, I understand!\" said Tom. \" Get out of the way, do, and let me bring in Daisy.\" \" Yea, Thomas !\" \" Forward, Daisy ; and never mind his toes.\" The- Beverend Mortification found it good policy to get out of the way. as quickly as pos sible ; and Tom, leading Daisy into the open shop, closed the door quickly behind him. Mrs. Eipon was fast asleep in the back parlour, but Tom pretended he thought she had fainted, and adroitly cutting a piece of the woollen skirt of Mortification's coat, he set it alight under his mother's nose. Without waiting for a reply, Tom made his way into the shop again; and holding Daisy by a good handful of her mane, he let her through a side door into a gloomy little passage, at the fur ther end of which was the staircase that con ducted to the upper part of the house. Tom was fully impressed with the idea that Daisy was capable of anything, going up-stairs included ;' and, in fact, he had good ground for such a supposition, for her wonderful sagacity suppUed in her almost the power of speech. \" Come on,\" said Tom, \" and take it easy, Daisy.\" Keeping a step or two in advance, and stiU holding her by the mane, Tom then slowly ascended the staircase, followed, at first very cautiously, by Daisy, -who, however, after a few seconds, when she found the footing firm, waist up the steps, as Tom afterwards declared, betten than many Christians. The pungent essence produced awakened Mrs. Bipon, with an alarming number of sneezes. \" Mother,\" said Tom, \" I want some more money.\" \" What have you brought, my jewel ? \"Nothing.\" \" Then where do you expect to go to, you un dutiful son ?\" CHAPTEE CCLI. TOM RIPON AND DAISY ARE CAPTURED BY WILD. Tom laughed, and was about to make some reply, when a series of violent blows on the outer door warned the whole party of the arrival of some one with whom, at all events, secrecy was not an object. \" Gracious heavens !\" exclaimed Mrs. Bipon, Jonathan Wild kept up the violent knocking at the door until Mortification opened it. \" Yea, what wanteth thou, man of wrath ?\" \" Tom Eipon,\" said WUd ; \" and I mean to have him.\" ' \u25a0\u00abe-\u00bb;"], [220, "214 EDITH HERON. He pushed abruptly past Mortification, and glaring about him Uke some tiger seeking his prey, he strode into the back parlour. It was evident that Wild was much disap pointed to see nothing of cither Tom or Daisy. \" Transportation for Use,\" he cried, \" or else hanging, which would you Uko best, for keeping the most notorious fence in London ; or will you save both your lives by giving up Tom Bipon ?\" Mrs. Eipon thought it most convenient to fall into a swoon ; and Mortification, waving his arms about like the saUs of a windmill, cried out aloud, \" Yea, Mr. Jonathan Wild, what would we not do to obUge you ? But if Thomas is not here, what shaU we do ? Can we, as the psalmist says, make bricks without straw ? or Tom Eipons and Daisies, when they are not here ? But yea, I say unto thee, Jonathan WUd, thy ' regulars' are ready.\" It' was perfectly weU known among the famUy what Jonathan WUd's \" regulars\" meant. They were the sort of black mail, or per cent age upon their nefarious profession, which he ex tracted from the receivers of stolen goods in London. front windows of the house, he felt perfectly convinced it was well watched. Now, the fence of Mrs. Bipou was a house of very peculiar construction. It had what may be called, for want of a better term, a back front as well as a front front. This back looked into a narrow street \u2014 indeed, so narrow, that it made the houses look preter naturaUy tall. It was towards the dusk of evening, and just as a fine, small rain began to saU, that a window iu one of the houses in the back street, exactly opposite to the fence, was carefully opened. That window, however, was only opened suf ficiently far for tho upper part of a head to ap pear at it with two ferocious-looking eyes. If Tom had seen those eyes, he would have beeu able to name their owner at a glance, for they could belong to no other person than Jona than Wild. Now, it so happened that there was not a single house in the street that was not in a state of con siderable dilapidation ; and, in fact, they only preserved their perpendicularity by the various props, struts, and supports which kept them up. Such was the state of things then as the rain began to fall aud the night to darken on the evening alter Tom Bipon had taken refuge at his mother's. WUd made a gesture of impatience. \" I Jmow aU about that ; but I will not be led this dance from post to piUar by Tom Bipon. I must and will have him. I promised to spare him, but that was on condition that he kept quiet\" As he spoke, Jonathan Wild glared about him, and, to his great disappointment could see no indication whatever of the presence of Tom Eipon. It was a thousand pities that neither Mortifica tion, Mrs. Bipon, nor Tom thought of any dan ger from the back of the house. It was left completely unprotected \u2014 that is, so far as vigUant observation was concerned ; al though, of course, its lower doors and windows were amply secured. Gradually, then, and slowly, so as not to make the least noise, was this window to which wo have alluded in the opposite house opened. Then, Jonathan WUd, with -extreme caution, stood upon the window-siU. By so doing ho could conveniently grasp one of the horizontal supports which supported that and Mrs. Eipon\"s house. It was a perilous journey he was about to undertake ; but his object was evidently by that horizontal beam to pass from one house to the He evidently began to think that his informa tion, or his surmises, had failed him. \" So, so !\" he muttered ; \" it seems I must seek elsewhere for him who is destined to grace Tyburn Tree before long.\" Mrs. Bipon spoke not a word ; and the manner in which the Bev. Mortification played h_3 part of perfect indifference was exceedingly well done. WUd actually began to believe that he was wasting his time. \" WeU,\" he said, \"be it so. I- know the busi ness you carry on here, of course, quite weU ; we settled all that on my last visit ; and, as for those 'regulars' you speak of, I wUl caU for them at another time, when more convenient.\" As WUd spoke, he dashed out of tho shop, and jumping into the chaise, he drove off. That is to say, he appeared to drive off ; but there was no telling exactly what complicated piece of cunning he was likely to have pro jected. Tom waited a good hour, and then the day light came so strongly upon him that he felt how extremely hazardous it was to venture abroad with Daisy. It was an irksome thing for Tom to remain at the fenco for tho whole of a day ; and, on his own account,' he certainly would not have done other. WUd was not a dexterous man, nor by any means clever at gymnastic feats; but he made up for every other disqualification in such matters by the indomitable energy of his character, and the terrible perseverance with which he set about anything. He slowly, but surely, made his way along the beam. The abyss below him looked profound in the darkness, aud the fall would have been fatal. Once, too, he had a terrible fright. The beam made an ominous sound as it crack- ing. Wild paused, and tho cold perspiration stood upon his brow. His strength seemed to be deserting him, and it was almost a wonder at that moment that he did not relax his hold, aud fall crashing into the narrow street below. so. But it was for Daisy that he was willing to make any sacrifice, and put himseU to any ia oonvenionce. Tom procured some Utter aud made a bod for his four-footed friend in tho first floor, so that she was comfortable enough ; and from various observations he made from time to time from tho And what preserved him at that moment of imminent danger was perhaps tho most singulai thought that could occur to tho miud of any man."], [221, "215 EDITH HERON. He recollected the prophecy that had exercised always so strong an effect upon his imagination, to the effect that he was doomed to be hanged ou a particular date at Tyburn. adjoining room to that occupied by Tom Eipon and Daisy. If was only the lower part of the premises that was used as yet by Mortification and Mrs. Eipon for the purpose of carrying on their rather doubtful business. It was strange that such a thought as this should nerve him to overcome the terror of his situation. That upper part, then, in which Tom Bipon now had so dangerous a companion, was other wise deserted. He actually spoke aloud. \"If I am born to be hanged, this beam wUl not crack asunder, aud let me be dashed to pieces upon those cold, wet stones below.\" The beam visibly deflected in the centre, and WUd now, as he moved onwards, felt it shake beneath his weight. As he neared Mrs. Eipon's house, however, the danger decreased, since he was closer to one of the points of support to the beam, and it was an immense relief to him when he rested his feet Tom was speaking to Daisy. He was making his preparations, as soon as the darkness should deepen a httle, to leave the house. But Tom had not quite made up his mind whether to go upon the road that ensuing night or to take Daisy directly to the stables of Whit combe House. Tom did not deceive himseU, but knew per fectly well that the leave he got from Felix Heron to take Daisy out for exercise by no means extended to the latitude of seeking adventures with her upon the highway. upon the siU of the window, immediately opposite to that from which he had emerged. Twice Wild passed hia hand across his brow, and twice, as he did so, he called himself some hard names for risking so much, even for the capture of Tom Bipon and of Daisy. .It was quite clear that by some means he had estabhshed the fact in his own mind that they were in the fence. He rather, then, felt the necessity of showing himself occasionaUy, and, indeed, of inviting Heron's attention to the fact that Daisy was safe in her stable. But all Tom's thoughts and dispositions upon this subject might just as weU have been left alone, since Jonathan Wild was almost literally within arm's length of him and the gaUant crea ture who had hitherto carried him in such safety through so much peril. And now he cautiously opened the widow. He bent forward to listen. He heard a sound which was music to his ears. The suort of a horse. \" WeU, Daisy,\" said Tom, \"how do you feel ? Pretty well, eh ? That's right ! \" Tom's conversations with Daisy were of a most singular description, since he supported them all himseU both in. question, answer, and He could have shouted with satisfaction, for he felt assured now, that he was on the right track for getting possession of Daisy. At' that moment he would have com pounded with Tom for the deUvery of that gallant steed, and allowed him to escape ; for by some strange perversity of reasoning, Jonathan WUd had always fancied ho possessed a kind of reversionary interest in Daisy, after the supposed death of Felix Heron. rejoinder. \" That's right, Daisy ; and, after all, U you've no particular objection, I do think we might as well sally out to-night and see what Fate has ia store for us. Eh, Daisy \u2014 you have no objection ? That's right!\" Tom carefully saddled and bridled his four footed friend. The nervous system of Jonathan Wild had been somewhat deranged by tliat terrible and peril ous transit from one house to another; but that one sound which assured him he was on tho right scent, and near to the accomplishment of his wishes, recovered him completely. He spoke in low, muttered tones. \" All is well \u2014 all ia well. I shaU at last achieve the object of my desires ; for, after FeUx Heron, who shall so well bestride that noble steed to which he owed so much of his celebrity, as I?\" And aU this whUe Wild was listening very in tently. The house on that upper floor was curiously constructed. There were but two rooms ; and at the top of the stafrcase was a small landing, from which merely a ladder led up to what might be called the attics, but which were in reality only a couple of lofts, situated exactly beneath the sloping roof of the house. The capture of Tom Eipon was now quite a secondary consideration with Wild. In fact, if Tom had appeared, and chosen to make a bargain with the much-dreaded thief taker, he might have secured to himseU at least the promise for perfect immunity from all con sequences of his career on the road, provided he surrendered Daisy. Tom was not likely to make such a bargain, but U he would have done, how gladly would WUd have ratified it. The two rooms had no communication one with the other, or Tom might have been taken at a worse disadvantage than he was ; but the slender, old, dry, lath and plaster division that divided them was scarcely any obstruction to sound, and WUd could hear everything that Tom said with ease and distinctness. \" Well, Daisy,\" added Tom, after a few mo ments' pause; \"notwithstanding, as you will, perhaps, say, I have lost my coat and my hat, we will still go upon the road ! I dare say the old gal wiU find some other fine dress among her odds and ends ; and, who knows, but we may make a better appearance still ?\" If Jonathan WUd could have seen what Tom was about for the next five minutes, ho would The window was at that height from 'the ground floor, that to take trouble in fastening it might well appear to be useless labour.

About the conclusion of that process, Wild heard the snap of one of the pans as Tom closed it. \" Ha, ha ! my young friend ! WeU done \u2014 well done !\" Tom flung his arms around the neck of Daisy, and at that moment he thought his heart wo uld break. \" Oh, Daisy, Daisy ! \u2014 what have I done, my poor Daisy ? AU is lost !\" In another moment WUd strode into the room. Without deigning to look at Tom, he flung open the window, shouting to some of his buUdogs who were keeping watch without. \"Ah!\" thought Jonathan, \"I have wasted precious time ! He is armed, and we shall have a tussle yet ! Well, well, what matters ? If I count the buUets that have been fired at me, they would come to scores ; and if, indeed, I bear a charmed Use, which only can be taken from me in one particular way \" Wild winced a little, and gave a peculiar twist to his neck, as he thought of the particular way.

For what will be will be, or the word fate should not have found a place in the English language!\" There must have been a dramatic element in the character of Jonathan Wild, for we have fre quently seen that he loved to do things not always, perhaps, in the safest way, but always in the most effective.

There is a look of anxiety upon her fair face, which sorrow has imprinted there. Two figures, wrapped in cloaks, have been watching closely the door of Whitcombe House, and had been rewarded for their patience by seeing, at length, Felix Heron, disguised as Captain Fan tome, and'followed a pace or two behind by Ogle, leave the haU of the mansion, and proceed down. St. James's Street Eap, rap, rap ! WUd knocked at the partition between the two rooms. Tom started, and uttered a loud exclamation. \" HiUoa !\" cried Wild. \"Who's that?\" said Tom. \" Is it you, Morti fication ?\" \" Not exactly,\" replied Wild. \" Mortification, I take it, in the fuU sense of the word, is on your side of the partition !

I need not tell you who I am, for you know by this time !\" \"Jonathan WUd!\" We wUl listen to the conversation of these two men ; and, probably, our readers wiU have no difficulty in recognising them. \"Hush!\" said the taller of the two. \"The bridegroom \u2014 ha, ha! \u2014 the bridegroom is about to leave his bride ; and we shaU be able to make our own terms with the fair Countess !\" \"Exactly!

Don't be foolish!\" \" Yes, yes!\" repUed the other; \"lam better now. I have got over the foolish idea that pos sessed me, that I had seen a spectre. Let us go at once, and make our own conditions with Edith.\" \"Come on then, Warringdale \u2014 come on at once, or the sea-Captain may return before our business is concluded.\" These two men, then, Warringdale and John Tarleton, made what speed they could to gain admittance to the house of Felix Heron. \" There's an old proverb that says, ' Short reckonings make long friends !' Now, I will not give you till the Sessions after next, nor even till the next, so here goes !\" Tom calculated upon the slender character of the partition, and knowing that his pistols were accurately loaded and well rammed down, he fired both of them at once through the fraU wall, in the hope of hitting Wild. Fortune seemed to favour their design ; for, at that moment, a servant in Uvery knocked at the hall door, which was immediately opened by Mrs. Ogle, and deUvered a note to her. Just as Mrs. Ogle was about to close the door, John Tarleton stepped forward, and, thrustin<* his foot inside the door, said, in a peremptory tone of voice, \" Tell the Lady Edith that there are two gentlemen who wish to see her particu larly on business.\" Before Mrs. Oglo could recover her presence of mind, John Tarleton and Lord Warringdale were striding past her up the grand staircase of the The report was prodigious in the confined space; and Tom himseU was half bUnded by the smoke of the gunpowder.

Leave tho house instantly, or I will call for those who wiU quickly rid me of your hateful presence ! Be gone, I say !\" WhUe Edith was speaking John Tarleton had seated himseU upon one of the many luxurious couches with which that magnificent apartment was furnished, and pointed to another, saying to Warringdale, \" Be seated, my lord ; my sister will soon become more hospitable, I hope ; and we will then tell her our business here.\" Lord Warringdale seated himseU with his back towards the door, evidently fearing that Edith might make her escape. At the first sound of those voices in the hall, Edith had sprung to her feet, and was about to turn the handle of the door to ascertain tho cause of the commotion in the hall, when she found herself suddenly face to face with John Tarleton and his infamous associate, Lord War ringdale. For a moment Edith felt that her heart stood still, so sudden and unexpected was the appear ance of thc two men. But in a few minutes she recovered her presence of mind ; and, but for the clutching grasp with which she held by a table, there was no visible sign of the perturbation within. \" What want you here, men of crime ?~ asked Edith, in as steady a voice as she could com mand. \" What want you here, I say ?

Edith made a gesture of contempt. \" Hear me out, I say. While you were the Countess of Whitcombe, you were safe ; but now that you have no Ionger a right to that title, I claim mine ; and give you fair warning that un less the thing be amicably arranged \u2014 mind, I say amicably \u2014 the law must take its course.

I defy you, aud scorn you ; and unless \" To divest himsolf of the hat and wig, which made his disguise as Captain - Fantome so com plete, was the work of a moment ; and then he stood with his hand on the handle of the door, ready to come to the assistance of his Edith. John Tarleton, fancying he heard a noise, rose from the couch .on which he- had seated himself, and telling Warringdale he would keep guard on the outside of the door, he, Warringdale, and Edith were left alone together. - \"Stop, stop!\u2014 not so fast!\" added Warring dale. \"Think again. Think of your chUd \u2014 Felix's child \u2014 and say if the law is to step in and arrange this little dispute between us. .

Give me ton thousand pounds, and I wUl trouble you no more.\" A door at the other end of the room opened quietly. Warringdale's back was turned towards this door, and only Edith saw FeUx, who made a sign to her not to recognise his presence in any way. A glanoe was sufficient to show Edith what Felix Heron intended by this sudden appearance, and the effect he wished to produce upon. Lord Warringdale and John Tarleton. With that flno sense of adaptation to any cir cumstances presented b - ' er where moral murage and fidelity were reqi-. -.-J, Edith at onee took tlie hint which Felix Heron's presence gave her, and improved upon it at discretion. But we must let the reader know exactly what that presence waa, and how it wa* likely to have so great an effect upon the nervous system of Lord Warringdale. Heron had had time completely to attire him self in his ancient costume of a highwayman, and it was almost with a glow of delight that Edith saw him looking handsome, picturesque, and gallant \u2014 even as she used to do, when first she surrendered her heart to the soft bondage of his affections. \" And you, John Tarleton \u2014 you, too, doubtless, have some request to make?\" cried Edith, turning upon him with flashing eyes. \" Yes, sister.\" Edith made a gesture of impatience. \" Ah ! Do you disown your brother?\" \" Monster !\" \" A hard word. But I, too, wUl tell yot_, Edith, Countess of Whitcombe, or Lady Fantome, whichever it may please you best, that I, too, have resolved to secure to myseU some of our father's property. He must have left wealth suf ficient for us both. Take your share, and give me mine ; and let us see each other for the last time.\" It is evident these two men, who were thus cowardly attacking a lonely woman, had quite lost sight of the fact that tune was hastening on, as it does in aU transactions, whether pleasant or otherwise, and that they were no further ad vanced in their diabolical scheme of forcing Edith to purchase their absence than they were when they first entered that room. A more strikingly dissimilar figure than he now presented to the Captain Fantome who was sup posed to be the new husband of the Countess of Whitcombe, could not be imagined. It was but an experiment on the part of Heron \u2014 this appearance in his old, original character\u2014 and he had some doubts of its success. The fact is, Edith was trying to gain time, knowing that Felix was not far off, and that his business was not such as to detain him long from home. StiU she began to feel all the perU of her situation, and it needed aU her indomitable energy of character to veil from the eyes of her two heartless persecutors aU the agony she felt at that instant Once before had Lord Warringdale been terri fied by the supposed apparition of his brother ; but time had elapsed, and he had shaken off the impression which the phenomenon had first made upon him. Its repetition was likely to be much more effective than even the first appearance. Warringdale might have argued himseU into a belief that his imagination had misled him that some sickness of the brain, or affection of tho nerves of sight, had produced the seeming apparition. \"WeU,\" said Warringdale, after a few mo ments' pause, \" are you considering our proposal, Edith ?\" \"Yes,\" said Edith, in a low voice; and she pressed her hand tightly on her heart, for a faint footfall \u2014 the step of all others she knew the host \u2014 had fallen upon her car, \u2014 \" yes, I am consider ing.\" Its re-appearance now, however, would be conclusive. \"That is weU !\" said John Tarleton. \"I would much rather part friends than other wise.\" But Edith heeded him not She was asking herself U Felix knew in whoso company she was ; and when sho found that he was not coming in And now Edith began to speak in such words as to favour the effect that was to be produced by Heron's presence. \" Be gone,\" she said ; \" nor poUute this house further by your presence.

Take things easy, and I will promise you an extra bundle ef straw, to save the jolting of the cart that takes you to Tyburn Tree !\" There were no arts or viUanies that you did not practise against him !\" \" Beware !\" said Warringdale, savagely. \"My power at Court is greatly increased.\" \" I care not\" \"Beware, I say again; for I maybe a dan gerous foe !\" \" Then,\" said Edith, \" I wiU invoke the aid of heaven and its ministers to defend me ; and if he who has gone before, has but the power to look down npon earth on those he loved, he may like wise havo the power to do a something to defeat their enemies !\" Tom at once stepped between WUd and Daisy. \" Hold, Jonathan !\" he said. \" li you must fire, take care you don't hit her. I'm fair game ; but I wouldn't see a hole in Daisy's sleek coat for haU the world.\" Warringdale laughed. \" I, never reaUy feared him on earth,\" he said; \" and I wfll not fear him now that he has gone from it!\" \" I don't intend it,\" said Wild. \" Daisy is mine, and I shall always look upon her as the legacy of Captain Heron.\" A tremendous uproar was at this moment heard below, for some haU-dozen of Jonathan's men had arrived, and were holding high battle with Mortification and Mrs. Bipon. \" That wUl do,\" said Wild. \" Then,\" cried Edith, \" I say to you beware, lest these boastful words should beget a terrible retribution !\" \" These are idle threats,\" said Warringdale. \" Let him come !\" \" Let who come ?\" said John Tarleton, at this moment, as he looked into the room. He blew the call-whistle he had with him shrilly ; but the reply to it was not exactly what ho had expected. The confusion below grew more intense, and so many cries and yells were mixed np with it, that even Wild began to get alarmed, and to listen with unusual attention, in the hope of dis covering what the frantic tumult was aU about. , Heron walked slowly forward. \" He is here!\" he said. \u2022 There was no mistaking the voice. There was no mistaking the face and figure, even if the dress could have been merely a delusion and a theatrical effect. Warringdale fell backward into the arms of John Tarleton, who, with no real intention of supporting him, did so for a few moments iu petrified amazement. \" He is here!\" said Heron again. \" Gracious heavens !\" exclaimed Edith. The voice of Mrs. Bipon arose, like a war-cry, above aU other sounds. But WUd was surprised to hear that his men made nothing but outcries, as though they liad faUen into some trap, which inflicted upon them serious bodily pain. About haU a minute had elapsed, and then the agony of fear was too much for both Tarleton and Warringdale, and fighting with each other, they dashed from the room, falling down the whole depth of the grand stau -case, and heedless of the wounds and bruises they received in that process, scrambled to their feet again. They made their way out of Whitcombe House, looking Uke men more dead than aUve. \" Tom Bipon !\" he said, shortly and sharply. \" WeU, Johnny ?\" \" You are my prisoner.\" \" Something strikes me,\" said Tom, \" you said that before.\" \" And,\" added Wild, heedless of the interrup tion, \" as such, you ought not to attempt t\u00bb escape. You have fired two shots at me, and I have not returned them. Give me your word that you wiU not budge from this place whUe I go and see what's the matter below.\" \" WeU,\" said Tom, \" that's about the coolest thing I've heard of for many a long day !\" \"Then I must make sure,\" said WUd, again handling his pistol. \" No ono can blame me for your death; for I can easily say you resisted capture, and I was compeUed to take your Use in self-defence.\" There can be no doubt but that Warringdale, in consequence of his connexion with that strange society that met at that lone house iu PaU-Mall, considered that he might threaten and assail Edith with impunity. Supernatural terrors might now, however, keep him back ; for he could scarcely doubt but that he had seen the apparition of his brother. \" Stop a bit,\" said Tom ; \" if I were alone, things might turn out. differently. But \" Tom, as he spoke, turned caressingly to Daisy. \"No,\" he added; \"you must run no risks. A chance shot must not strike yon. I yield, Jonathan Wild, for Daisy's sake.\" CHAPTER CCLIII. MRS. RIPON HAS A PITCHED BATTLE WITH JONATHAN WILD'S MEN. \"I ddh't care for whose sako it is!\" cried WUd, as he dashed out of tho room, and rattled down stairs. We return to Tom Eipon. The state of affairs in connexion with Tom and Daisy seemed desperate. WUd's shouts from the window to his myrmi dons who were lurking in the neighbourhood were sure to be effective in a few moments. And Tom had no weapons now with which to defend either himself or Daisy. Tom heaved a deep-drawn sigh. \" Oh, Captain Felix ! Captain Felix !\" he said, \" where are you now ? If you could but know the danger that Daisy was in, how soon you would be here ! And then, not Jonathan Wild and aU his men would be able to carry her off from you.

He went to the door and Ustened. He heard his mother's voice declaiming at a great rate. \" Now, you wretches, you came for the swag, and you've got it ! I hope you Uke it ! And as for that mean-spirited wretch, Mortification, I've a good mind to give him a ladleful aU to himself!\" These words opened Tom's understanding as to what had really occurred. for Jonathan Wild's men got it ; and the silvery shower, for once in a way, was exceedingly un welcome. This at once accounted for all the noise and confusion, which only ceased on the appearance of Wild. His men, however, cut rather a grotesque ap pearance, with shreds and globules of the now cooled metal hanging about them. \" Handcuff the witch !\" cried Wild. \" The woman is a pest, and should have kicked her last at Tyburn long ago.\" \" Indeed!\" cried Mrs. Eipon, as she placed the still hot ladle upon Jonathan's back. Wild made a spring forward that quite de- Ughted his men, since it is a principle of human nature that a community of misfortune is always delightful. It was just this. Wild's men, after knocking twice, and finding the outer door not opened to them so promptly as they desired, burst it in, and, like a parcel of Cossacks, or other savages, rushed into the place, scattering Mrs. Eipon's goods and chattels in aU directions. Haying achieved this partial victory, Mrs. Eipon, like other skilful generals, effected a re treat into the back parlour. But she carried the ladle with her in so triumphant a fashion, that Mortification, who stole a glance at her from behind the clock, thought she looked decidedly mischievous. He glanced uneasily forth whUe Mrs. Bipon solUoquised. \" I only wish I could find where that wretch Mortification has hidden himseU! The mean spirited feUow, to leave a poor, lone, weak, help less woman to fight his battles ! But they shan't take Tom prisoner. I'U have at them again !\" Mrs. Bipon would have joined any fracas that might be supposed to take place up-stairs ; but that Wild, as soon as he had seen her fairly housed in the back parlour, had had the prudence to shoot a couple of bolts in the door, and so keep her a prisoner. The Eev. Mortification beat a hasty retreat ; and, sUding behind an old-fashioned eight-day clock that stood in a corner of the back room, he hoped entirely to escape observation. But Mrs. Eipon's indignation took a warlike turn, and, after flinging at the heads of Jonathan Wild's janissaries every portable article within her reach, she rushed down a short flight of stairs which led to the lower regions of the house. An excellent flre of coal, coke, and turf was always kept there, enclosed in a brick encase ment, so that it looked like a chemical furnace. On this fire was the celebrated \" melting-pot,\" which formed so important an item in the stock in trade of a fence. Tom Eipon looked pale and calm when WUd and his men reached the upper room. His right arm was stiU flung round the neck of Daisy. Into that were cast all articles of silver likely to be identified. SUver spoons, snuff-boxes, plates, dishes, soup tureens, sword-hUts, chains, watch-cases, and, in fact, every article of that metal, with crest and initial, that might be safely sworn to. The molten silver gUttered and seethed in this melting-pot from morning tUl night, and from night till morning. Whenever it got incon veniently full a portion was removed in a red hot ladle, and run out to cool into a glittering slab upon the stone hearth of the kitchen. The refiners and jeweUers of the City never refused to purchase these well-known silver ingots ; and their identification with any stolen property was perfectly impossible. Gold was treated in a very different fashion. Where the article was one of great beauty, from its workmanship, it generally found a market in some of the Continental capitals. There was something touching in the sight of Tom's affection for that voiceless creature, who could only with its Umited instincts return the kindness and caresses he lavished upon her. \" Come,\" said Wild, \" the time's up.\" \" I'm ready,\" said Tom. \" But look you here. Jonathan ; U you wUl take Daisy back to Whit combe House, and ring the beU, and tie her bridle to the door-knocker, and then walk away and leave her there, you may come back and. shoot me as soon as you please.\" \" Bah !\" said WUd. \" What good would it do me to shoot you?\" \" Perhaps none ; but it's a fair offer.\" \" No, Tom Bipon, I won't do it. I never, in. all my lUe, envied Captain Heron but one thing, and that was Daisy.\" Tom sighed. \" And now,\" added Wild, \" that he is no more, I make no scruple in taking possession of her ; though, it he were alive stiU, I don't think that even I should have the heart to separate him from her.\" Otherwise the precious metal was beaten up by. hammers until it had lost all its original shape and appearance, but none of its weight Mrs. Bipon then made her way to this labora tory of the fence. The red-hot ladle was reposing gracefully in the silver melting-pot. \" They shall have it !\" said Mrs. Eipon. \" It's what the wretches come for.\" \"You wouldn't!\" cried Tom, darting forward. \" Say that again, Jonathan.\" \"What for?\" In three minutes more she had reached the shop again, with a ladleful of the molten metal in her grasp. It was scarcely necessary to say, \" Take that!\" Tom Eipon shrank back again. 'i Nothing \u2014 nothing ; I was only thinking.' \" Thinking of what ?\""], [227, "221 EDITH HERON. \" Nothing. I have said nothing.\" \" And yet any one, to have looked at you at that moment, could almost have sworn you thought it possible the grave might give up its dead.\" \" Look here, Mr. Wild,\" ho said; \"if I promise you that I wiU go to Little Newgate without trying to give your fellows the sUp by the way, there can be no good in troubUng me with a pair of bracelets.\" \" Hold !\" said Tom, with animation; \" I wiU strike a bargain with you, Jonathan Wild.\" \" What is it?\" \"Oh, stuff!\" said the janissary, \"we always do.\" \" Let him alone,\" growled Wild : \" upon his word that he never attempts to escape, he may leave alone the darbies.\" \" WUl you give up Daisy freely, and without a murmur, U \u2014 U \" \" If what ?\" \"Stop a bit,\" said Tom; \"never is a large word, although a little one to speak. I promise that I won't try to escape between here and Little Newgate ; but never is quite another affair.\" \"On with them, then,\" said WUd, angrily, \"and get the horse down stairs.\" It would have been foUy for Tom to resist seve ral strong men, who, in spite of him, and most Ukely with the infliction of some injury besides, would have put on the handcuffs, so he quietly submitted. Tom sank his voice to a low, solemn tone as he added, \" If Captain Heron himseU should come to claim her?\" Wild retreated a step or two. What could Tom Eipon mean by such an ex pression ? Could the grave give up its dead? or was that dreamy possibility which had more than once come Uke a shadow over the mind of Jonathan Wild, that FeUx Heron was after aU not dead, really a truth ? \" Speak more plainly, Tom Eipon,\" he said. \" Your own life, and the lives of others, may hang upon your answer.\" But Tom Bipon was not disposed to speak more plainly, since he even began to regret that he had spoken so plainly as he had. \" They were idle words, Jonathan Wild,\" he said, \"and idly spoken.\" WUd advanced towards him, at the same moment that he snatched a lantern from the hand of one of his men, and holding the light in such a position that its full rays came upon Tom's face, he looked at him with a steady and glaring scrutiny. By a kind of manual dexterity, however, which was weU practised and known among the light fingered gentry, Tom managed to give his wrists the appearance of being much larger than they reaUy were, so that the ; fair of handcuffs put upon him were of a size heftl; confident he could easUy sUp out of. \" Quick, quick !\" cried WUd, impatiently. \" Are we to wait here aU nig '.it?\" It was easy to cry \" Quick !\" and be impatient, but a very serious obstacle presented itseU to WUd's janissaries in carrying out his orders. Daisy had no notion o s being handed down stairs by somebody of whom she knew nothing, and who, her sagacious insMuct seemed to teU her, was an enemy of Tom pon. The moment one c' WUd's men placed his hand on her bridle to lead her to the landing at the stair-head, she made a seemingly vicious bite at his arm. WUd, indeed, held his hand up between the lantern and his own eyes, much in the manner of connoisseurs when they look at a picture in an artificial light. Tom did his best to stand this critical examina tion. The alarmed janissary dropped the bridle in stantly. \" It's a vicious brute,\" he cried. \" I can do nothing with it.\" \"That is too absurd,\" cried Wild; \"the creature is docUity itself, and almost has the sense of a human being.\" \" Now, say again,\" cried Wild, \" that they were idle words, and idly spoken.\" \" I do so,\" said Tom ; \" and they need not disturb you.\" For more than a minute Wild subjected Tom Eipon to this disagreeable scrutiny; then handing back the lantern to the man from whom he had taken it, he spoke in a low tone of voice, saying, \"Be it so \u2014 but this is a matter which shaU be inquired into. Now, men, look sharp, and be hanged to you aU! Get the horse down stairs, and take this boy to Little Newgate.\" Tom would rather be taken to Little Newgate \u2014 that is to say, to Wild's house \u2014 than to the ac tual prison of that name. The fact that WUd chose personaUy to have possession of him was something Uke an intima tion that he was not to be handed over to the law. Tom laughed. \"Try it yourself, then, Jonathan,\" he said. \" Perhaps Daisy has heard of you, and fallen in love with you.\" \" Come on !\" said WUd. Snap went Daisy's teeth within an inch of his nose, and WUd retreated so rapidly, that he stumbled over two of his men. \" Confound the brute !\" he muttered. \" She must and shaU be mine.\" Tom was deUghted. \"You may depend upon it, Jonathan, she won't go,\" he said, \" and you had better give it up as a bad job. You've got me, and that's enough for one night's work.\" \"No,\" said WUd, \"I don't do things by halves; Daisy goes with me, or she hes here a lump of earrion.\" There was hope in that. And Tom had so much faith in his own in domitable courage and ingenuity, that he had very Uttle doubt of being able to extricate himself even from what at present seemed to be bis serious difficulty. WUd produced one of his pistols, and shook the powder in the pan. \" I'm ready,\" said Tom. One of the janissaries approached him to sUp a pair of handcuffs upon his wrists, but Tom pro tested against such an indignity. Tom's heart, as the popular saying goes, was in his mouth, at the idea of such imminent danger to Daisy ; and for the moment he lost his"], [228, "222 EDITH HERON. keen sagacity and presence of mind, as any one is apt to do, when the feelings make war with thc judgment. Under ordinary circumstances he would have been able to decide at once that Daisy was in no real danger, and that Wild producing a pistol, with the implied threat of shooting her, was but an idle menace. \" Help ! help ! murder ! Hold her head ! Help ! help ! The creature's gone mad !\" It was lucky for Jonathan WUd that his feet came comfortably out of tho stirrups, for Daisy sprung to her feet with a snort and a bound, and dashing the mud and stones of the roadway in a blinding shower over Wild and his men with her hind feet, she went down Wardour Street at a gallop, and in less than half a minute disappeared in the Oxford Boad. \"Hold, hold!\" cried Tom; \"you would do a deed that the repentance of a life could not undo.\" \"What then?\" \" Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah !\" cried Tom. \" Hip, hip, hurrah ! Three cheers for Daisy ! How do you feel now, old Johnny ?\" Jonathan WUd sat in the road with his back propped against a post, and looking about him in a bewUdered fashion. Tom stamped his foot impatiently. \" What must be, must be,\" he said. \" I wfll lead her down stairs, and you'll obtain possession of her. Behavo kindly to her, Jonathan Wild, and it may not be forgotten at some time when you may stand between lUe and death.\" There wae a certain air of dignity about Tom as he thus spoke, which had even some effect upon Jonathan WUd. His face was plastered with mud, and if he suffered nothing but bruises from the rough tumble he had had, he was much luckier than he had any reason to hope or to expect There is very Uttle doubt but that Tom, in the confusion, might have got away, but he had pro mised to go quietly to Little Newgate, and a ro mantic sense of honour of keeping his word, re strained him. CHAPTEB CCLIV. DAISY REFUSES A NEW GUIDE. \u2014 JONATHAN WILD'S DISCOMFITURE. Wild's janissaries looked upon the whole scene aghast, beUeving that Daisy was some fiend in the shape of a horse. Wild then burst into a series of imprecations of the most fearful character, and hi^ own ja nissaries, who might be presumed to be accus tomed to his particular moods and tempers, shrunk from him in terror. Tom was released from the handcuffs, in order that he might lead Daisy down the ricketty old staircase of the fence, in Wardour Street The moment Tom laid his hand on the bridle, and spoke to her, Daisy foUowed him with the docUity of a lamb. \"Come on, Daisy,\" said Tom, \"it won't be for long. There are those who won't put up with the knowledge that yon are in the hands of Jonathan WUd.\" Tom Bipon took things easy. The escape of Daisy was a subject of sincere congratulation to him, since he had not the sUghtest doubt but that she would find her way home, and then he knew that Ogle would take good care of her. Indeed three parts of his anxiety in regard to the mal apropos adventure that had taken place seemed to be removed from his mind by this gallant escape of Daisy. And in liis usual odd fashion of endowing Daisy with reason and speech, Tom shook his head, as he said to himseU, \"Ah! Daisy did better than I. She didn't promise not to escape, so she's off, and I'm on my road to Little New gate. However, it's a good job one of us has got away.\" WUd's breath became exhausted by the im precations he uttered, and then two of his men approached him to help him to his feet The thief-taker shook himself, and one of his men picked up his hat and wig, both of which were pretty well splashed* with mud. \" Where's the boy ?\" growled WUd. \" Here, boy,\" said Tom Bipon ; \" where are you ?\" \"Bah !\" said Wild ; \" I mean you.\" \" How should I know that ? I thought you were speaking of some boy, and not of a high wayman. However, U you think me a boy, you ought to be ashamed of yourseU to come with half-a-dozen strong fellows to make me a pri soner.\" \"And who may they be?\" growled Wild. \" That's my business,\" said Tom. \" You've a long tongue,\" said WUd ; \" and I warn you not to use it so freely.\" \" I don't suppose,\" repUed Tom, \" that you wUl care much for warnings from me ; but, for all that, I do warn you that the worst night's work you ever did you've done to-night. If you IriU Daisy your own Use is not worth twelve hours' purchase; and U you keep her, you are likely to get so hard a knock from somebody, who will come to take her from you, that you may not easUy recover it.\" \" Thank you,\" said WUd, sarcasticaUy. \" Not withstanding aU these terrible threats, Tom Bipon, I will take my chance.\" Daisy descended the staircase with Tom's hand on the bridle, and, in the midst of the stUl faU ing rain, the whole party sallied out into the street. \" I will ride,\" said Wild, \" you can get a coach, and take this boy to Little Newgate.\" WUd, as ho spoke, put his foot in the stirrup and mounted Daisy. Tom was rather surprised to see that she per mitted him so easUy to do so, but Daisy was taken by surprise, and Wild was in tho saddle be fore she began to find out he was not her accus tomed rider. \" Take him along,\" said Wild. \" Put him in number two cell. He and I wiU come to a reckoning to-morrow.\" Wild's janissaries were glad to take leave of him, and finding an empty coach at the corner o Daisy, however, quickly brought things to their proper level. She deliberately laid herself down in the road way, and rolled over Jonathan Wild."], [229, "223 EDITH HERON. Leicester Fields, they hustled Tom into it, and set off for WUd's house in Newgate Street Jonathan, with his hands behind his back, and walking with difficulty, for he had been consider ably bruised by his tumble, went up Wardour Street towards the Oxford Boad. \" When I say brandy, I mean haH-a-pint My name is Jonathan WUd.\" He always gloried in the terror which his name created ; ani the celerity and the humility with which he .was served were pretty good proofs that his evil reputation had. reached to that humble little hostel. He growled and grumbled to himseU in haU audible tones, aB was his fashion. \" I don't know what to make of it As for getting possession of Daisy, it's only a dream. The creature has been so petted, and pampered, and tamed, and spoken to by Heron and Tom Bipon, that she never wUl be worth her weight in mere horse-flesh to me or any one else. I wonder where she has gone to now.\" \" That wiU do,\" said WUd, as he flung the pewter measure on to the doorstep. \" That wfll do. I'll call and pay.\" The landlord was glad to compound with WUd's absence with haU-a-pint of brandy ; and the great thief-taker, considerably revived by the Ubation, which would have prostrated any one else, took bis way along the Oxford Boad, stiU pondering and speculating upon the events of the night \" What could the boy mean by Heron himself coming to claim Daisy of me ?\" There was some thing in his tone I could not understand, and which struck me at the moment as strange and peculiar. Can it be possible that I am deceived, and that some artful plot has been constructed, to make me believe that Felix Heron is no more, whUe, in reality, he is in life ?\" WUd looked right and left in the Oxford Boad, but saw no traces of Daisy. \"WeU!\" he added; \"I've got that boy a pri soner, but what to do with him I don't know. He is young, active, bold as a Uon, and fuU of a thou sand tricks and ingenuities, that might in three years' time make a fortune. I wouldn't mind giving him three years fairly on the road if he would share his plunder with me ; and after that \u2014 weU, after that he must take his chance, and go the way of them all. A short life and a merry one, and then Tyburn Tree. Ha, ha!\" WUd laughed, but it was a laugh as unlike mirth as anything could possibly be. He Tapped at the door of a little roadside pubUc-house ; for Oxford Street, then caUed the Oxford Boad, was quite a suburban sort of thoroughfare, having, particularly on its northern side, old-fashioned buUdings of the Charles the First period, with their sharp angled roofs and gable-ends, such as have long since disappeared, except in some ancient portions of the metropo lis. This was the first time that such an idea had reaUy been expressed by Jonathan WUd ; al though the probabiUty is that, in a vague, un certain manner, it had found a home in his brain. He stopped short. The sound of his own voice, as he started the idea, sounded to him almost like a communication on the subject to him from another person. It is strange how, when a floating supposition exists in the imagination upon any particular subject, it acquires force and UkeUhood by being spoken of. And the relief was immense to WUd to think that, after aU his superstitious fears, Felix Heron might be in Use, and ready to vindicate his own safety and his own honour. The sensations of WUd were quite tumul tuous. \" House ! house !\" cried Wild. The landlord appeared, with rather a scared look upon his foce. \" What's the matter ?\" inquired WUd : \" it's early enough, isn't it, to keep open door ?\" \" Something has happened,\" said the landlord. \" A mad horse.\" What should he do it such were the ease ? \"Ah!\" \" Yes, it first went country ways, and then came thundering back as it the deuce itseU was at its heels.\" What would happen in regard to the peerage of Whitcombe ? What would be his relations, then, with the man whom he had persecuted so long, but to wards whose supposed widowed wife and orphan child he had certainly been a friend? WUd leant his back against a post at the corner of a thoroughfare that led far away into the fields, and began to think over the matter. WUd had no doubt whatever but that this was Daisy, although the information that it had just gone country ways, and then returned, was no guide whatever to him in pursuit of it even had he been so incUned, which he could hardly be said to be. One by one he recalled aU the circumstances connected with the supposed death of FeUx Heron . His last interview with Daisy had wonderfuHy cooled bis prepossession in her favour. Mentally he had given up the idea of ever caUing her his own, or making her useful to him in his excursions in the neighbourhood of Lon don. Wild had a retentive memory ; and every Uttle incident bit by bit and piece by piece, rose up before bis mind's eye, as though they had been enacted within the last four-and-twenty hours. There was much in those incidents to make him doubt, now, the reahty of the death of Heron. \" Brandy,\" he said, \" and be quick about it.\" \" Yes, sir. WUl you step in 7\" \"No.\" The landlord of the Uttle inn brought WUd out a glass of brandy on a tray. It was too dark for him to see the look of contempt with which he regarded it ; but when WUd took it up, and threw it deliberately into the man's face with an oath, be became aware that he had rather mistaken the But then his thoughts turned to Whitcombe House and to Edith. There he was completely at fault. What could she mean by the manner in which she had encouraged the intimacy of the Baron Von Peck? order of his brutal guest. And worse than that, what could she have"], [230, "224 EDITH HERON meant by actually marrying Captain Fantome, if FeUx Heron were still in life ? These mental inquu-ies were hard to answer. But Wild had not the highest opinion of womankind ; although, certainly, if he had been asked what was his ideal of perfection in that matter, he would certainly have rephed the Countess of Whitcombe. given forth by the eastern sky regarded him at tentively. \" Dead !\" he said. \" Ha, ha ! dead !\" \" Not quite !\" said Wild. Snap went the lock of one of his pistols. There was a flash of powder in the pan, but that was all \u2014 the weapon had missed fire. The man with the brown cloak uttered a shriek of dismay, and -would have instantly fled, but 'his feet got entangled in that long garment, and he was near falling. \" Hold!\" shouted Wild as he sat up, and pre sented his other pistol. \" Not so fast, U you please. One may miss, but two are not Ukely to do so.\" \" Mercy ! mercy !\" \" Such mercy as you wished to show me.\" Wild fired. But he was sorely puzzled. Tightening the belt of his hanger, he stroUed slowly down the narrow verdant thoroughfare, at the corner of which he had remained for so long in deep thought. He muttered to himself, \" No, no ; Felix Heron must he dead. The conduct of Edith the Coun tess cannot be accounted for under any other supposition. I might as well believe that that wretched creature, Warringdale, after sinking like a plummet of lead deep into the bed of the Thames, should rise up again and confront me in his human shape.\" Bang ! went a pistol shot at this moment. WUd's hat was sent flying from his head, as though struck off by an invisible hand. The shot had been fired at him from amid a clump of trees growing to the right hand of the roadway. The aim was by far too good to be pleasant, and Jonathan Wild, without losing his presence of mind, adopted at once a plan which on more than one occasion had not only saved his own Use, but placed that of the person assaUing him in his power. Uttering a sudden cry, he sprang up into the air, after the manner of a person shot, and then he let himself fall prostrate on the earth, and lay apparently without sense or motion. There were many persons who knew Jona than WUd too well to take him at bis word, even that he was killed. That pistol exploded in due course, but at the moment it did so the man with the cloak had completed his entanglement in its skirts, and fell to the ground. The couple of bullets with which the pistol was loaded flew harmlessly over his head. But the would-be assassin of Jonathan WUd had not nerve and seU-possession enough to play the same part that Wild had done, and pretend to be shot. He made frantic efforts to rise. He struggled haU-way to his feet, and with tho instinct of self-preservation rather than from any impulse of real courage, he drew a sword he wore, and in a few seconds stood upon the defensive. \" Good !\" cried Wild, as with a flash and a ring ing sound he drew his hanger from its sheath. \" Good ! If that's the game, two can play at it, and I like nothing better.\" With his left hand the mysterious stranger held on the mask to his face, and retreating step by step towards the wood, he feebly defended bun self against the violent onslaught of Jonathan Wild. . Those persons would have fled from the spot, but it was not so with him who fired the shot that seemed to be so effective. Such a combat was not likely to last many minutes. A rather tall masked figure, wrapped up in a dark brown cloak, emerged from the little wood. \" At last ! at last !\" cried this person \u2014 \" at last I am avenged !\" Owing to the mask partiaUy covering the mouth of the speaker, the tones of the voice, which otherwise might have been famihar to Wild, sounded strange. He lay profoundly still, for he was determined, before he executed summary justice upon the assassin, to know who he was, and if he had any accomplices. \" This is excellent,\" added the man with the ma6k. \" My lUe will no longer be the one of terror that it has been. I am creeping into favour at Court, and this viUain WUd is the only man I had to dread.\" Wild advanced with fury, and struck down the slender sword opposed to him. \"Mercy! mercy!\" cried the stranger. \"By the memory of the past, Jonathan Wild, have mercy upon me now, and I can and wUl serve you well.\" The mask dropped off. The voice was unmuflled. Wild started back and dropped his sword point as he exclaimed, \" My Lord Warringda le ! and still in life ! Or does the earth breed such men ?\" \" No, no ! shrieked Warringdale. \" I am still in life. I am stiU your old associate \u2014 your old friend !\" \"Friend?\" \" Yes \u2014 yes. Whatever you may have thought, and whatever others may have told you, I was always your friend.\" \" Humph !\" \" Oh, beUeve me; and what is more to the pur pose now, I am in favour at Court, and can be of service to whom I please.\" \" Indeed !\" CHAPTEB CCLV. JONATHAN WILD AND LORD WARRINGDALE MEET AGAIN. \" It is true ! \u2014 it is true ! Try me \u2014 test me, Wild, and ask some favour to-morrow.\" As he spoke, the man with the mask leant right over what appeared to be the dead body of the gccat thief-taker, and by tho faint night light \" You did not go exactly Hie way to work, my Lord Warringdale, to put me in a position to ask a favour of you\u2014 except one.\""], [231, "225 EDITH IHRON. \u00ab One ?\" \" You say so.\" \" Yes \u2014 a decent funeral.\" \"I mean what I say, Jonathan Wild.

I do not say that he is alive, but I mean to say tbat I am not sure he is dead.\" \" Gracious heavens !\" \" Hush ! Speak of the other place as much as you like, but the less you and I, my Lord War ringdale, mention gracious heaven the better.\" \" But you alarm me !\" \" That is likely enough.

And if yon want money \" \" I always want money \u2014 my expenses are rather large.\" \" Take this rouleau of gold, then,\" said War ringdale. \" It is heartily at your service.\" \" Ah !\" said Wild, drawing a long breath as he pocketed the gold. \" This is indeed welcome, and looks Uke business.\" \" But tell me, as you value peace of mind and my rest, what it is that has put the fearful idea into your head of the continued existence of FeUx Heron ?\" \" Why, look you here,\" said WUd, as he sUd his arm familiarly beneath that of Warringdale's. \" Look you here.

' What ?\" asked WUd, sharply. \" The coronet of the Earls of Whitcombe.\" \" Indeed !\" \" Yes- My hopes rise up afresh ; and with your assistance, I think that I may fairly lay claim to something Uke an expectation of wearing the ermined robes of a peer.\" \" So\u2014 so !\" That back street was a narrow one, and the waU of the stable-yard was high. Daisy might have tried to jump it if there had been space enough for her to take a good rush at it ; but there was not, and she sagaciously for bore to make the attempt. Ogle, who happened to he at the back part of the house, heard a strange thumping sound in the direction of the stables, and hurrying to the spot, he felt assured that some one was attempting to make himseU heard by heavy blows on the gate. There was a bell, which it seemed so much easier to ring than to make such a tumult, that Ogle paused in amazement, and felt a slight sen sation of superstitious fear, as he Ustened to the strange sounds. WUd rested his chin upon his hand and lapsed into deep thought It was astounding how completely he seemed to have given up aU idea of personal danger from Lord Warringdale. After a pause he spoke. \" Upon what do you found your claim ?\" \" The death of Felix Heron.\" \" But his chUd ?\" \" I mean to append one expression to that child's name, which shall stick to it through life.\" \" What expression ?\" \" Bastard !\" Bang ! bang ! bang ! at regular intervals, came the blows on the stable-yard gate. \" What can it mean ?\" said Ogle ; \" and at this time of night, too.\" Like most uneducated persons, Ogle was cer tainly inclined to think that anything he did not at once understand, must be, or at aU events might be, supernatural. That was a consideration, however, which was not sufficient, altogether, to prevent him from taking steps to ascertain who it was that on the other side of the stable-gate was creating so much confusion. \" Oh, oh ! you are there, are you, my Lord Warringdale? I might have guessed as much, since, U report speaks truly, no man in aU the world is better qualified to know sorely how that title sits upon the heart.\" \"My own origin wiU not be inquired into,\" said Warringdale hastUy. \" If I can prove, or seem to prove, that my haU-brother Felix has left no legitimate heir, the King, through the in strumentality of the Marquis of Arlington, and my Lord Clackington, will issue a new patent, and that will euro aU defects.\" By the assistance of a short ladder, Ogle was very quickly able to look over the parapet of the \" Listen :' said Wild. \" Wh\u00bbi is it ?\" wall."], [233, "227 EDITH HERON.

But since she is all safe in the stable, and sound in wind and limb, he wiU easily forgive Tom ; and as for scragging, there wfll be two words to that bargain.\" Yes, there was a horse there, who in the dim night-Ught looked black and shadowy. A horse, who, standing close to the yard- gate, was, at regular intervals, hammering at it with one of his hind feet. The idea that this horse was Daisy never en tered the imagination of Ogle, but as the idea of a spectre horse had Ukewise never found a home in his mind, he at once dismounted from the lad der, and opened the small wicket-gate in the frame-work of the larger one. Daisy turned about immediately and trotted into the stable-yard. Then Ogle knew her. \" Daisy,\" he exclaimed, \" by all that's pre cious!\" CHAPTEB CCLVI. TOM PASSES A NIGHT EN LITTLE NEWGATE. The ceU in Little Newgate which had been designated by Jonathan WUd as that in which Tom was to be imprisoned, was certainly one of the most wretched that the great thief-taker had constructed beneath his house, and beneath the pavement of Newgate Street. But stUl the matter was one of great mystery, since the fact that Daisy had been loose at all, and outside her stables, was one that Ogle could not account for. What were his precise intentions with regard to Tom Eipon it is hard to say ; but, as we have before remarked, Tom looked upon it as a good sign that he was not handed over to the law. To aU appearance, WUd had completely rein stated himself in the confidence of the autho rities, and was carrying on quite bis old mode of Use at Little Newgate. The establishment was about as close an imitation, on its 6mall scale, of the great prison it adjoined as anything could weU be. There was a man upon the lock, as the tech nical phrase went; and a small wicket had been construct. d in the street door, through which any persons demanding admittance could be questioned. A little parlour on the ground floor had been, only within the preceding week, set apart as an office, in which sat a miserable-looking wretch, who played the part of clerk to Jonathan Wild. He had been a pickpocket, but was lamed by being run over by a carnage at the door of the Opera one night, when he was diving under it to escape with a watch he had just dexterously picked from the pocket of a noble lord. \" What now ?\" cried the man on the lock at Jonathan Wild's house, as the rather strong party arrived with Tom Eipon. \" A prisoner !\" \"AU's right! \u2014 the more the merrier! Is he an old bird, or one of the young 'uns that's easy nabbed with a Uttle bit of chaff ?\" Tom Bipon had had such particular and special charge of Daisy, and had shown so much jea lousy of any interference in that charge, that even Ogle had ceased to question him about her. Tom, then, was the proper person now to speak to on the subject of Daisy's singular arrival home from an expedition outside the stable, apparently alone. Tom's sleeping apartment was a small room opening from a long corridor that connected the stables with Whitcombe House. A very brief examination of that room showed that it had not been slept in ; and then the whole affair was as clear and patent to Ogle as if Tom had sat down and related it to him word for word. \" I understand it now,\" he said ; \" it's as plain as a pike-staff. Tom has been out on the road on his own account, and has got nabbed.\" As Ogle thus spoke, he turned round twice, and took a survey of Tom's little sleeping apartment A picture hung upon the waU. It was but the rough sketch with charcoal of Daisy, and had been drawn by one of the band in Epping Forest, whose early Use was devoted to the arts. Just peeping out cornerwise from between the frame and the wall of this picture was a slip of paper. Ogle pulled it entirely clear of the frame, and by the stable lantern he brought with him he read upon it the foUowing words : \u2014 Tom was hustled into the passage, aud a lan tern was held up slightly above his head, so that its rays should fall fuU upon his face. \" I don't know him,\" said the man on the lock. \" Ogle, it there has been a row about my not coming home, nor Daisy either, I'm nabbed. Tell the Captain, so that he may look after her ; but as for me, it's no matter. I suppose he'll think that I ought to be scragged for taking Daisy on to the road. \" This comes from \" But Mr. Wild does,\" said one of the janis saries. \" Yes,\" said Tom, \" we're slightly acquainted ; and it's always odds whether I take Johnny or Johnny takes me. It's his luck this time.\" The men looked at each other, and laughed. \" Tom.\" \" Well, come on,\" said two men, who took Tom specially under their guardianship, \u2014 \" come on ! Jonathan WUd wiU get here before wo have bestowed our prisoner, and then there wfll bo the deuce to pay.\" \" All right ! Now, young feUow.\" With these words, Tom was removed from the passage, and down a flight of stone steps, which were wholly unUghted, and which looked dark and cavernous in their gloomy depths. The whole affair was quite clear now, with the exception that Tom had not calculated upon the extraordinary circumstance of Daisy making her escape, and reaching her stables at Whitcombe House alone. Ogle drew a long breath of relief. \" Things might be worse,\" he said. \"I don't know what the Captain would have said it any-"], [234, "EDITH HERON. 228 leaving it, ho threw a small packet into tho corner. Tom stopped abruptly. \" Well, what now ?\" asked one of tho men. \u00ab Hold hard !\" said Tom. \" Surely you don't mean to put a fellow in a cell down in that gloomy region ?\" \"Those are our orders, young 'un,\" replied one of the men, at the same time that Tom fancied he detected a look of compassion upon bis hard-featured face. Then the door was banged shut, and Tom was alone with his own thoughts. The first thing he did was to pick up the little packet thrown into the corner by the man Goff; and when he opened the paper, he found, to his great joy, that it contained six or eight of the thieves' matches. \" Thanks, friend,\" exclaimed Tom, as he thrust them into his pocket ; \" as soon as I have taken a good look at my prison, I'll put out the candle to save it, now that I havo the means of lighting it again.\" Tom was young and sanguine, and hoped that the man might perhaps befriend him in some way, so he merely said, \" Well, what must be, must be, I suppose ; but you give a fellow a look in occa sionally, just to pass the time? When wUl it be supper time, by the by ?\" \" There will be no supper for you, I can tell you,\" growled the other man, \" if you keep us here much longer. Get down with you, or I'll save you the trouble of walking.\" Tom thought it best to make the descent with out further parley, and after going down a long slight of stairs, one of the men produced a match from his pocket, and lighted a small end of cau dle iu a lantern, which he carried in his hand. While this man, who was addressed as Adams by his companion, was thus occupied, the other man, upon whose face Tom fancied he had de tected something less ferocious, produced from his belt a massive bunch of keys- Tom held up the lantern above his head, and turned twice round. \"Humph!\" said he; \"not very unlike the little wine-ceUars at Whitcombe House, barring the wine. What have we here? Ah! an old screw ; perhaps we shall want you.\" Tom looked about him again. \" Ah ! I see a long nail in the wall ! Well, that may be handy if a fellow wants to hang himself ; and I don't seem to mind much whether I get out or not ; for the Captain will never forgive me \u2014 he can't ! Well, well, it can't be helped now !\" Tom paused and opened the slide of the lantern. \" I must not burn this any longer, that's cer tain. I must think what I had better do.\" Selecting one of these keys, he thrust it into the lock, and a heavy door grated on its hinges. \" There's your berth, youngster,\" said he ; \" it's nice and dark, so that you can sleep well until Mr. Wild wants you.\" Tom stopped on the threshold. He had endeavoured to take a survey of what was to be his prison ; but so dark was it, and so faint were the rays of light emitted from the lan tern, that Tom could come to no conclusion as to the size or appearance of his cell. Puff! Tom blew out the candle, and set the lantern down on the ground of the cell. \" Heigho ! I wonder where Daisy is ? If she got home to Whitcombe House all right ? And whether Ogle has found my directions? He'U make the best of it to the Captain, I know that : but he'll not forgive me, I'm afraid ; and then I'd much rather Jonathan Wild hung me at once.\" It wUl be seen that our friend Tom had lost somewhat of his usual buoyancy of spirits and that his present difficulties were augumented by the reflection that he had in some measure abused the confidence of his much-loved master. \"Look you here,\" he said; \"I've come here quietly, and have given you no trouble ; what will prevent you giving me a light just tUl I gel used to my new apartment ?\" The man Adams shook his head surlily. \" You won't havo a light if I know it ; so you'd better go in, and make your life happy without one.\" Tom was young, and fatigue began to tell upon him, so he stretched himseU on some straw, and soon he was, in his dreams at least, in Daisy's stable, caressing and being caressed by her. \"WeU, then,\" said Tom, \"just take off the darbies, then. I can't do any harm in the dark, you know.\" The two men exchanged glances- \" No, no f\" said the man Adams ; \" it's Jona than Wild's orders that the prisoner should wear the bracelets; and we can't go against orders, eh, Goff ?\" This question was addressed to Tom's other gaoler. For two short hours Tom was happy. * . . . * Tom had slept for two hours, and awoke re freshed by the sleep he had had. He stretched out his hand, aud grasped the lantern. \" Ah !\" said he ; \" 1 was afraid that was a dream too, and that I really had no means of looking about me. Now for a Ught !\" Tom had no difficulty in obtaining a light, thanks to the man Goff, who had given him the matches, and soon he was feeling in his pocket for the long naU he had picked up from the floor of his cell. \" No, I don't see that wo can take the darbies off; but I think we might as well just leave the boy this bit of candle. It will enable him to see the black beetles and toads, and such like, as are to be his companions.\" \" WeU, for the matter of that, I don't want to be hard on a fellow ; it won't last long, and Jonathan Wild wiU not visit the prisoner till long after it has burnt out. So good night to you, and pleasant dreams.\" \" Here we are now,\" said Tom, \" ready for work. We'll see if I can make any impression on the lock.\" Tom set to work with his long nail, but ho found it would be a work of time before he could hope to make good his escape by the door\u2014 and window there was none. With these words the two men turned to leave the cell ; but Tom saw Goff make a sign for him lo look in a corner of the cell ; and just as he was It will be recollected that Tom had still the handcuffs on when his two gaolers left him, but"], [235, "229 EDinr in eon. by the clever contrivance we have before aUuded to, ho was enabled to slip bis hand out quite easily, as soon as he was sure that no eyes were upon his movements. So Tom worked for more than an hour, when he was startled from his occupation by the rough, growling tones of a voice ho knew too well. Hi! nevertheless made au effort to shake olf the superstitious fears with which Tom impressed him. He abruptly changed the subject. \" You know my mind,\" he said. \" If you consent to my terms, you are free ; and I will promise you three uninterrupted years upon the road.\" They were those of Jonathan Wild. To fly to the lantern and extinguish the Ught, and to replace the handcuffs, was the work of a few seconds. Scarcely had he accomplished these two feats when tho key was thrust into the door, and his arch foe appeared on the threshold. We have already mentioned during the course of this history that Jonathan Wild was not hand some, and the cast in his eye, and thc knack of holding his head on one side which he had when he wished to impress any one with a sense of his power, was anything but consoling to Tom on this occasion. \" And divide all with you ?\" said Tom. \" Yes ; you cannot do better. In fact, it is your only resource.\" \" I doubt that\" said Tom ; \" and, at all events, Jonathan, I must take timo to consider.\" \"As long as you please ; only remember that that time comes out of thc three years ; and it is far better to pass it on horseback, in the shady roads, and on the open heaths in the neighbour hood of London, than in this cell.\" Tom's agreement with Wild on that point was perfect; but still he had not the slightest idea of making the arrangement proposed by tho great thief-taker. \" I leave you now,\" added Wild, \u2014 \" I leave you now to your own meditations. You are scareely yet a man, and yet not so much of a boy but that you are able to come to some con clusion upon what I propose to you.\" Tom nodded. \" Ha, ha !\" laughed Wild as soon as he en tered the cell, holding above his head a hand lantern. \" So the bird is quite safe. How are you, eh?\" As Wild said this, he gave Tom a kick with his heavy boot, which Tom, however, returned with interest. \"Quite well, Johnny,\" said Tom. \"I hope you're tho same, eh ?\" As Tom spoke, he dealt Wild a blow with both his hands, which sent him reeling to the other side of the cell. Wild made an abrupt gesture of farewell, and turned to leave the cell ; but he paused a moment on the threshold, and returning two steps, he spoke again. \" I wiU add likewise to my proposition, that I will leave your mother, Mrs. Bipon, and that bundle of hypocrisy, Mortification, free leave during tho whole of that timo to keep a fence ; so, you see, it wiU be a nico Uttle famUy arrange ment for you.\" \" And I to be hanged at the end of it !\" said Tom. Wild was furious. \"Wretch! \u2014 villain! You shall pay for this, as sure as my name is Jonathan Wild ! You shall hang \u2014 you shall hang !\" \" Thank you, Johnny ; that all depends on circumstances. I fancy I shall have the pleasure of seeing you \u00abdancing upon nothing at Ty- burn ! Eh, Johnny ? What do you say to that, Johnny?\" Jonathan Wild winced, for ho had a wholesome dread of the gaUows ; and the prophecy that he would one day be hanged at Tj burn was ever present to his imagination. \" Hold, Tom Eipon !\" he exclaimed. \" I came hero to offer you terms \u2014 to offer you your freo dom \u2014 upon condttions.\" \" What conditions ?\" asked Tom. Wild shrugged hia shoulders and left the cell. Tom then quietly again slipped his wrists out of tho handcuffs, and sat down to think upon what ho had better do next. CHAPTEB CCLVII. FELIX HERON DETERMINES TO GO IN SEARCH OF TO 51 RIPON. \" That you wUl swear to me, by all that you hold most sacred, that what you said about Captain Felix Heron was merely intended to frighten me \u2014 not that there was any truth in the statement.\" We return to Whitcombe House. Felix Heron was rapidly made awaro of the extraordinary circumstances attending the return of Daisy, and the safe and sound condition of his favourite four-footed friend and companion of the road. \" In what statement ?\" asked Tom, coolly and calmly \u2014 for he now began to hope that he might bo able to work upon Jonathan WUd's super stitious fears, \u2014 \" in what statement, Jonathan Wild?\" But it was with looks of concern that Oglo made the communication. \" In the statement that Captain Felix Heron might perhaps come, and claim Daisy of me him eeU.\" Ogle, despite all his roughness and pecuUarities at times, had many fine and noblo traits in his character. \" Oh, I meant his ghost,\" said Tom. \" I've seen it twice lately ; and, what's more, I think ho has some means of knowing everything that happens. So, you see, Johnny, U anything did happen to Daisy, or to anybody the Captain had taken a fancy to, there's no saying what might be the consequence.\" WUd was pale as dcatlt His friendships and affections were particu larly sincere; and next to Felix Heron, there was no person, probably, in aU the world that Ogle had a tithe of the regard for which he felt for Tom Bipon. It was at a very early hour of the morning indeed, therefore, that Ogle sought Felix Herou with a face fuU of care and auxiety."], [236, "230 EDITH HURON. been overpowered by numbers and arrested. In either case, however, he shall not be aban doned.\" \" I don't think, Captain, any one runs a great risk of abandonment who has anything to do with you.\" And Heron faithfully enough reflected those looks when he became fully aware of the unusual circumstances attending the return of Daisy. \" And Tom Eipon, you say, has disappeared, Ogle ?\" \" Yes, Captain ; but if you read this, it won't be difficult to come to some understanding about the case.\" Heron reflected for a f e w seconds \u2014 not upon what he would do, but upon how he would do it \u2014 and then turning to Ogle, he said, \" Saddle Daisy at once for me ; I will but speak to Edith, to ex plain to her the cause of my sudden absence, and then I will be off at once to seek for Tom.\" \" Shall I accompany you, Captain ?\" \"No, Ogle. Always remember -that when I am not at Whitcombe House you must be there. We should never leave it together ; and you are well aware that as regards its protection, I look upon you in my absence as a second seU.\" In ten minutes, FeUx Heron, in his full dis guise as Captain Fantome, of the royal navy, issued out at the narrow street at the back of Whitcombe House, mounted upon Daisy, and prepared to seek for Tom Eipon. Heron perused in silence the mysterious me morandum which Tom had left behind the pic ture in his sleeping apartment. It was only for a moment, then, that a sUght flush of indignation and anger came from tho ayes n[ Heron, for he pictured to himself aU the danger that Daisy must have ran. He paced the long dining-room of Whitcombe House in sflence for several seconds, and then, turning abruptly to Ogle, he said, \" This is reaUy too bad!\" \" It's worse than that, Captain.\" \" Tom knows so well that the value I set upon Daisy is such, that more than once I have chanced my lUe for her preservation, and yet he has played with her safety in this reckless fashion.\" And now we shall see by the first proceedings of Heron that second thoughts are not always best, despite what any proverb may say to the contrary. \"It is too bad, Captain: you can't say too much about it ; and I have not a single word to utter in his favour.\" Heron's first idea was unquestionably to go to the fence in Wardour Street, and inquire of Mrs. Bipon and Mortification U they had seen any thing of Tom, or knew what had become of him. \" Who can ? Who can ?\" cried Heron. \" Nobody in aU the world, Captain ; and I've not the sUghtest doubt but that he's either shot or nabbed.\" \" You think so ?\" And if he had carried out this determination, he would, of course, have been quickly put in possession of full particulars in regard to the arrest of Tom by Jonathan WUd. But he did give a second consideration to that subject ; and from several circumstances, he was led irresistibly to the conclusion that it was in the country Tom had met with some mishap. One of those reasons was, that Ogle had in formed him Daisy was plentUuUy splashed with gravel and sand. \" Yes, Captain : and it serves him right, and all the better for him U he is shot, for that's better any day than a dance upon nothing at Tyburn Tree.\" \"Ogle!\" \" Yes, Captain.\" \" Much as I have cause to be indignant at Tom Eipon's conduct, I am not disposed to speak of liim so Ughtly or so severely as you do.\" This was precisely the frame of mind to which Ogle wished to bring Felix Heron, and it is evident that he managed the matter with consi derable judgment. Now those materials were scarcely to be found in Wardour Street. Heron accordingly abandoned the idea, which, if carried out, would have saved him much trouble; and, on the contrary, determined to seek for Tom on the outskirts of the metropolis. If Ogle had been so indiscreet as in any way to defend Tom Eipon, there can be little doubt but that the anger of Felix Heron would have Iroeu strongly excited against him. Hut hearing Ogle speak as he did, he, Heron, was, to a certain extent, disarmed of his resent ment, and began to feel a profound pity for Tom, based upon a recollection of his former services, and the great temptation it must have been for him to go upon the road accompanied by The only good roads out of London were, at that time, so blocked up by turnpikes, that there was little difficulty in tracing any one in any par ticular direction. The pike -man was a sort of general news monger. He was generany able to tell with tolerable accuracy who had passed through his gate within four-and-twenty hours. This was, then, one of the means by which Heron thought he should be able to trace the footsteps of Tom Bipon and Daisy. And as chance would have it, he took the Daisy. \" It is I who have been to blame, Ogle,\" he LiiA. ; \" for, I abandoned Daisy too much to Tom's care ; and I ought scarcely to have expected that a boy, such as he is, would resist the temptation to endeavour to tread in my footsteps.\" \" That's just it, Captain.\" Ogle stUl called Felix Heron Captain, al though if any one else had dared to presume to doubt, oven by implication, that he, Heron, was tho Earl of AVhitcombe, no one would have been so malignant as Ogle. \" Thoro is but ono thing to do,\" added Heron ; \"he must bo saved. He may be killed, or lying dangerously hurt on the road; or he may have Western Boad as the most likely one fer Tom's operations. He well knew that the man at Tyburn Gate had a sort of speciality for the recoUection of all persons passing through that barrier; and he was likewise well aware that any one who bore the appearance of a knight of the road would be looked at with more interest than usual by that man, inasmuch as it was pretty notorious among."], [237, "231 EDITH HERON. thies would be more Ukely to go with the bold dashing young highwayman than with his legal pursuers. the gentlemen who got a Uving by crying \" Stand and deliver !\" that he was always open to the inducement of a stray guinea to open his gate quickly for them, and slowly for their pur suers. But Heron got no inteUigence. He rode deep into the country, some distance past EaUng, and stUl had heard nothing of Tom Bipon. Even at the present day, that distance from London carries any one amid the shadowy twi- Ught of many an umbrageous spot, where the noise and turmoU of the city is completely ex tinguished, and nothing but rural sights and sounds meet the senses. Tyburn Gate has been long since swept away and even while we write, an enactment is be coming the law of the land which wiU clear almost all the roads leading from the metropoUs of those ancient barbarisms (turnpikes), with which are associated so many of the strange tales connected with the highwaymen of the seven teenth and eighteenth centuries. It was stfll early morning when, at a sharp trot, FeUx reached Tyburn Gate. The pikeman ran out with his night-cap on his head. Heron drew rein close to the entrance of a shadowy lane which ran across the road, pre senting, both to the right and to the left, dim thoroughfares, kept in perpetual gloom by the overreaching boughs of taU trees, and the road way of which was soft and springy with the accumulated faUen leaves of centuries. Heron flung him a sUver piece of money ; and, as the gate was slowly opened, he could not but perceive that the man looked narrowly at Daisy. The spot was one of great beauty, and, amena ble as Felix Heron always was to the charms of nature under all aspects, it was quite a deUght to him, after being pent up for so long in St. James's Street to breathe the fresh open air of the country, and hear the birds twittering upon the bonghs overhead. \" Have you seen this horse before ?\" asked Heron. \" I should rather think I have, sir.\" \" Indeed ! Upon what occasion ?\" \" WeU, sir, I don't know if you are aware of it ; but that's the famous mare Daisy, that was once the property of Captain Felix Heron, as he used to be caUed on the road.\" He thought of his own ancient sylvan home in Epping Forest A sigh of regret came from his heart t_.it he had ever deserted it. \" Indeed !\" \" Yes, sir ; and you might hunt the world through before you found a livelier piece of horse flesh, or a better roadster.\" \" And when did you last see this creature, of whom you speak in such high terms ?\" \" WeU, sir, I can hardly say ; for sometimes I come out with my eyes half-shut, to open the pike.\" \" Perhaps this will open them,\" said FeUx Heron, as he held out a guinea. The man hesitated. But this romantic mood of Heron's was :oon destined to be interrupted. Up the lane that lay to his right hand there came a horseman. Heron heard the duU beat of the horse's feet upon the soft turf and leaves before he could see either horse or rider, for the lane took a sudden turn near the point at which it crossed the high road. There was nothing very special or particular about the appearance of either man or horse, as the rider came into sight. He seemed to be what the world would caU a gentleman, although there was a certain style about his costume which would have induced Heron to be doubtful about giving him that title. \" I don't know you, sir ; but I keep a pike, you see, and have no caU to interfere with gentlemen of the law.\" \" Poeh, pooh ! I am not a gentleman of the law ; and aU I want you to tell me is, if, within this last four-and-twenty hours, this famous mare of the late Captain Heron's has passed through Tyburn Gate ?' \" There's no great harm in saying yes to that,\" repUed the pike-keeper. This seemed to Heron at the moment all the information he wanted ; but after riding on a few paces, he turned again, and called out, \" Tell me when you saw her pass?\" \" After dark last evening, sir.\" \" And not since ?\" The stranger fixed his regards intently upon Heron, and riding close up to him, he said, in a half -confidential tone of mystery, \"You're a hawk!\" Heron certainly had no idea what could be meant by this haU-statement, half inquiry, and for the moment he thought it might come from some one who recognised him, even through his dis guise, and who had known him during his career at Epping Forest. He scanned the face and figure of the strangei with great attention. Heron was convinced they had never met be fore. \" Not till now.\" The fact is, that the t_rnpi__.-_.eper was not in a condition to inform Captain Heron of the re turn of Tom and Daisy through the gate, since it was just at that time when his mate and deputy had charge of the pike. Heron then rode into the country, with a full conviction on his mind that whatever had hap pened to Tom had happened on that road, and that he would have but little difficulty in dis covering the particulars. \" It may not be pohte, sir, to contradict you ; but why am I a hawk ?\" \" That's right\" \" What is right, sir ?\" \" Oh, you needn't keep it up any longer. I have given you the word, and you have given me the answer \u2014 surely that's enough. And now I will give you the rejoinder. Hawks Iflot sj doves. WUl that do?\" It was not at large houses or at roadside inns that Heron resolved to make his inquiries, but at thc lowly cottages of the poor, whose sympa-"], [238, "EDITH HERON. 232 having got so far, he thought that at least he would waste an hour, even in his search after Tom Eipon, to get at the heart of the mystery. But Heron was not left for long to his own re flections. \" It will do for mo, sir, if it does for you.\" \u00bb Then that's all right. Let's come to the Ahbey.\" ,., . .... Heron looked with unfeigned surprise at this mysterious man, but there was nothing in his appearance to denote insanity; and as ho walked his horso over the roadway and down the oppo site branch of the lane, he seemed so fully con vinced that Heron would follow him, and that he perfectly understood why he was to do so, that the latter almost involuntarily permitted Daisy to take the same route. The man who had fired the pistol at an appa rently unoffending stranger trotted back to him. \" He's offV' he said. \" I don't know who he was. His stopping there might be accidental, or it might be part of a design to interfere with us ; at all events, it was better to scare him away.\" Heron was now determined to humour this man, in order cautiously to discover, bit by bit, what he was about. \" Yes,\" he said ; \" I think you have acted judi ciously, especially as you have done him no real harm.\" \" Not the least ; but I dare say you've heard what a dead shot I am.\" Scarcely had they got haU a dozen paces, how ever, down the lane, when along the highway came another mounted man at speed. \"Who is that?\" cried Heron's mysterious companion. \" Some chance passenger, I fancy.\" \" So shall I it he ride on ; but U he should pull up at the corner here, he is an enemy, and dangerous to us.\" The horseman did puU up at the corner of the lane, occupying very much the same spot of ground where Heron had paused with Daisy only a few minutes before. \" I think I have.\" \" But it's always better to make people take themselves off than have the trouble of disposing of a dead body ; that is the greatest nuisance in Use. But what is your opinion of our full success \u2014 for I suppose Sir Marmaduke has been quite confidential, and you know all about it?\" Heron was as much in the dark as ever, but he made a very judicious reply. \" Look at him weU,\" said Heron's new com panion, \u2014 \" look at him weU ! Do you know him?\" \" Not in the least.\" \" Oh, yes,\" he said ; \" and my opinion always is that it you expect any good service from a man, you ought not to make half-confidences.\" \" Exactly so.\" \" I have seen the evil of that so often,\" added Heron, \" that, feeUng confident in my own mind Sir Marmaduke has not deceived me in any par ticular, I am rather curious to know U he has been equaUy confidential and sincere with you.\" \"Confound him!\" cried the man. \" If he has not, I shaU not he best pleased. I have stood by him in many a scrape, and, of all men, he ought to be confidential with me.\" \" Then I am suspicious. He may be here to thwart us. I wonder U a buUet will scare him off?\" \" Would you shoot the man ?\" \" No, no ! I only want to give him a fright. You had better wait here for me, and I wiU do it, and then we can go to the Abbey together. The marriago is to come off in half an hour, and by that time the chapel wfll be as dark as a coal pit, and the Lady Gertrude wfll fall into the snare.\" As he spoke, this man trotted out to the road way again, and discharging a pistoL the buUet of which whistled over the head of the horseman who had just trotted up and paused at the en trance of the lane, he nailed out in a threaten ing voice, \" Take warning, sir, and ride on which way you will. You are not wanted here.\" The stranger horseman did take warning. He uttered a shout of alarm ; and bending low upon the saddle to escape any other shot that might be levelled at him, he turned his horse's head towards London, and set off at a gaUop. \" And yet,\" added Heron, \" men like Sir Mar maduke are very apt to think that they may tell just as much or Uttle as they like, and get all tho service they want.\" . \" By Jove, that's true !\" \" WeU, then,\" said Heron, \" what has he told you exactly ? Let me know, and then we will compare it with what he has told me.\" \" Yes, that's the way.\" \" Let me have it, then, just as U you were re lating a story.\" \" I will ; and you pull me up if there's any thing in it you know to be wrong, or that you can add in any way.\" \" I wUl\u2014 I will !\" CHAPTEE CCLVIII. \" Well, then, Sir Marmaduke Shuldham, though a man of ancient famUy, and indeed one of the oldest baronets of the kingdom, is not worth a rush.

Heron laughed Ukewise. \" Am I right so far ?\" said the stranger. \" Quite,\" said Heron ; although what he meant by Sir Marmaduke trading upon his name, after he had declared it was so damaged an one, he had not the least idea. \" Of courso she will,\" said Heron. \" WeU, thon, under these circumstances, when an ordinary man would have despaired, and per haps fled \u2014 for I rather suspect he has dipped deeply into his ward's fortune \u2014 Sir Marmaduke, on the contrary, formed the audacious design of getting the remainder of it by marrying her.\" \"You are rigl.t 7 far,\" said Heron. \" But there w.13 one little difficulty.\" Heron shook his head and smiled, as U he knew perfectly well what the little difficulty was. \" She hated the sight of him.\" \" Exactly so ; and I don't wonder at it.\" \"WeU, I must confess he's not the most lively looking person in the world.

Ho thought he began to see a little daylight through the obscurity of the narration. \" Gertrude, and her handsome young cousin, Marmaduke, were warmly attached to each other ; but the old lord would not listen to any sugges tion of their union, and the young man went to India, as a cadet in the Company's service, and to fight Tippoo Saib, amid theswamps and jungles!\" \"I wender what has become of him?\" \" If I arrive in England on the fourteenth of September, and reach the Abbey at twelve o'clock, wiU you base that consecrated chapel so dark ened that it wiU he impossible for us to do more than see each other dimly ?

He wrote a capital letter, and got it put into an Indian envelope, by some means, and addressed to Gertrude. In fact, I helped him to write it, as, perhaps, you know ; and I have a copy of it about me.\" \" So have I,\" said Heron. This was an audacious plunge, but it had its effect. \" Is that like yours ?\" said the stranger, as he finished reading this epistle. \" Word for word !\" said Heron. \" Then I need not trouble you to show it to me. Come on ; and we 6haU see the Abbey in a few seconds.\" \" It is a good plot,\" said Heron. \" Sir Mar maduke, in the darkness of the chapel, wUl as sume the character of the young officer from London, and wed his beautiful ward, the Lady Gertrude ?\" \" Exactly !\" \"But the imposture must he discovered?\" \" Oh, yes ! that's what Sir Marmaduke says ; but the difficulty Gertrude wiU have dropped into wUl be so great, that she wiU be only too glad to extricate herseU with the loss of half her for tune.\" \" Well,\" said the man, \"I'U read you mine, and then you can compare it with yours.\" As he spoke, he took a pocket-book from his breast, and, extracting a sheet of letter-paper from it, he halted his horse beneath the shade of a magnificent oak tree, and read to Heron, as follows, the forged letter which Sir Marmaduke had sent to Gertrude, in the name of her hand some young cousin from India : \u2014 \" Or the whole of it!\" \" WeU, I daresay she wfll give the whole of it, rather than continue the wffe of such a man as Sir Marmaduke Shuldham !\" The two horses had proceeded about a hundred paces from the old oak tree, and then an opening in the mass of vegetation, which was Uke some fair and beautiful triumphal arch, afforded sud denly a full view of the Abbey. Felix Heron thought he had never looked upon a more lovely spot. \" Dearest Gertrude, \u2014 \" I write to you half in despair, and half in hope. IntelUgence has reached me that you are now your own mistress, and may bestow your hand where you will. \" Alas, it is not destined to rest in that of your devoted Marmaduke ! \" I cannot \u2014 dare not aspire to tho proud po sition of calling myself your husband. \" In a skirmish with the troops of Tippoo, I have received two sabre cuts upon the face, which have disfigured me so fearfuUy that, for many weeks, I made a determination to retire from the world, and in some hermitage, or gloomy retreat, permit no man to look upsn my face. An 'ancient manorial residence, buUt of that warm red brick, which maintains its beauty and freshness amid aU changes of time and weather, stood at the further extremity of a lawn of vast extent and great beauty.

It was one of those charmingly irregular man sions, whieh might engage the explorer weeks and months in discovering the whole interior. Slanting roofs, turrets, ancient gable-end but tresses, and bay windows abounded in aU direc tions. \"Pigeon pie is good; and somo people say that young rooks make a good pasty. But behold aU those well ; and unless an earthquake takes place and swallows up the Abbey, Sir Marma duke wUl be successful, and in less than haU au hour he will be the husband of bis young ward !\" As he spoke, this man pointed to the taU turret we have already indicated. From one of its narrow side windows there fluttered a white flag. There can be no doubt that, for many cen turies, that mansion, complete in some perfect style of architecture, had been added to from age to age, and according to the fashion and spirit of each of those ages, untU it became the vast, irre gular, and somewhat incongruous mass it pre- sented. That was the signal. The signal mentioned in the forged letter with which Gertrude was to assure her cousin, the young officer, that her faith was unchanged, and that she loved him still. There was one turret in particular, which rose high above all the rest, hiving a kind of lantern or look-out of its 6un._.__, that was not unUke a modern Ughthouse. Heron's companion laughed. \" That's the way with women,\" he said ; \" any thing that's romantic is sure to seize upon their imaginations.\" \" It is something more than romance !\" repUed Heron. And throughout the greater part of the build ing there was an ancestral air. This no doubt had given it its name of the Abbey. \" HiUoa ! One would almost think, from your words and looks, that you were not exactly the sort of person Sir Marmaduke would have chosen to assist in a Uttle affair of this kind !\" And since the first portion of the mansion dated from a very early period, it is possible enough that it may have been originally erected for religious purposes. \u25a0 There were deer upon the lawn. A stately peacock sunned itseU upon a balus trade, which ran the whole length of one side of the house, forming a charming terrace walk. A rookery was estabUshed in the summits of a grove of lofty trees. \"I am here,\" said Heron, \"and that ought to be a sufficient answer to your remark !\" \"So it is \u2014 so it is ! I was only jesting ! FoUow me ; I know the old place well.\" \" But what are we required for ? If this is to be a matter of fraud, what are we to do ?\" \" In the first place, we are to be witnesses to the marriage ; and in the second, in case Lady Gertrude should decUne to foUow her husband, Sir Marmaduke, into the travelling carriage he has in waiting, we are to overawe the few servants in the mansion.\" Flights of pigeons wheeled and circled round the turret tops and high-pointed roofs of the mansion. WeU might Felix Heron pause, and look with unfeigned delight upon this truly beautUul coun try home, so serene in its aspect, and so appa rently surrounded with everything that could calm the senses and deUght the imagination. The expression of satisfaction in the eyes of Heron somewhat surprised his companion, who was a much more matter-of-fact and worldly personage than the gallant Earl of Whitcombe. \" Why, you seem quito taken with the old house !\" he said. \" I comprehend ; and you may be assured I win do my work !\" \" That's aU right ! And now come this way \u2014 for the sooner we find ourselves in the darkened chapel, the better.\" There was a bridle path which wound round the lawn, and the entrance to it was only secured by a gate, which Heron's companion opened with ease, by stooping from his horse without dis mounting. \" I am ! \u2014 I am!\" \" WeU, these things are matters of taste.\" \" It is reaUy beautUul.\" \" Perhaps so \u2014 but rather slow. Give me Pall Mall, and that after dark, too, when the gamiug-houscs are open, and there's something Uke life going on.\" \" But this beautiful lawn ?\" CHAPTEE CCLLX.

It seemed that she was surrounded by enemies ; and but for the accidental presence of FeUx Heron, the fearful plot in the meshes of which she was enveloped must surely have succeeded. \" And these antlered deer?\" \"A haunch of one of them, weU cooked, would be nice in the season-\" \" That peacock with its stately plumage ?\" \" Now, my dear fellow, did you ever want to sleep in the morning, and be perversely prevented by a peacock?

And I dare pay you care nothing for the rookery, or for those slights of pigeons spreading themselves out into various forms, with such grace aud beauty?\" The difficulty sho would have experienced in annulUng her marriage with Sir Marmaduke Shuldham would have been immense. There can be no doubt that U that marriage had taken place, it would only have been at the sacrifice of at least half her fortune that the Lady Gertrude would have escaped its terrors and entanglements. But it was not to be.

His companion foUowed him, growUng and im precating. How, and in what precise way, he was to save her, Heron as yet hardly knew ; but he determined that the marriage should not take place, let the force opposed to him be what it might, unless the Lady Gertrude really knew who was the bride groom. He had good reason to suppose that the man who was with him and Sir Marmaduke Shuldham were the only two persons en the estate with power and inclination to oppose him. Heron was used to fight his own way against greater odds than they could present to him ; and from the language uBed by bis chance companion, he was inclined to think that the servants of the house would gladly assist any movement in Lady Gertrude's favour. \"Ill be hanged,\" he said, \"if I know what to make of you !\" \"Perhaps you will know presently!\" said Heron. \" Well, I hope I shaU ; but where Sir Marma duke picked you up to assist in a little affair of this kind, I cannot imagine.\" \" Sirs,\" said the young i-nan who was leaning on the gate, when they were sufficiently close that tho low, faint voice in which ho spoke could be distinctly heard, \u2014 \" sirs, wUl you tell me who inhabits this house ?\" \" Who is the clergyman ?\" asked Heron. \" Oh, a friend of Sir Marmaduke's!\" \" That, then, accounts for him consenting to perform a marriage in the dark ?\" \"Exactly so!\" \" But U the servants should fancy anything was amiss ?\" \" What is that to you ?\" was the rough re joinder of Heron's companion. \" Nay,\" said Heron, \" the question is civilly put ; let us return as civil an answer. This house is now inhabited by Sir. Marmaduke Shuldham, who is the guardian of a young lady named Ger trude.\" \" They could do but little. There will be you and I, and Sir Marmaduke himseU, and his valet, making up together, I should say, a force quite sufficient to overawe the whole household, which principaUy consists of women servants.\" The young man uttered an exclamation. \" Gertrude a ward of Sir Marmaduke Shuld- Both Heron and the man who was with him were at this moment brought to a standstill by a voice calUng from the open roadway on the other side of the gate leading to the lawn. \" Sirs !\u2022 \u2014 sirs !\" ham's ; and in this house, the Abbey, too, once the abode of so much happiness \u2014 so much inno cence \u2014 so much \" The young man could not proceed. Some powers ul feelings evidently overcame him. A strange idea took possession, at that moment, of the mind of FeUx Heron. \" Who the plague is that?\" Heron turned upon this exclamation of his companion, and saw, leaning over the gate, a dust-covered, wayworn-looking young man. He had been looking narrowly at the travel stained, weary stranger. His face was bronzed, apparently by the sun of a warmer climate than England. He saw that he was young and handsome. There was a certain air about him, too, that Those bright rays appeared to have lent a tinge to such portions of his luxuriant hair as escaped from beneath the travelUng cap he wore. bespoke a man who had seen military service, which idea was further strengthened by a part of his dress having evidently belonged to an uni form. He was evidently only a pedestrian, and he oked a poor one, for he carried over his shoulder a small bundle suspended from a stick. And as this stranger leaned upon the gate he seemed faint and weary. The voice, indeed, in which he called out \" Sirs !\" as though he wished to ask a question of Heron and his companion, was indicative of great bodily fatigue and exhaustion. \" Who is that?\" said Heron. Could it he possible that this was the real cousin Marmaduke, who had arriyed at such a critical moment to rescue Gertrude from destruc tion? And if so, how little he could imagine that tho white flag he might have observed floating from the topmost turret of the Abbey merely by lUting up his eyes, unfurled itseU for his sake, and for the dear love his cousin bore him. \" Oh, some tramp !\" \" I think not !\" It was but an idea of Heron's ; but it grew each moment into form and strength, as though a voice from heaven had told him, \" This is the man ; and it is for you, Felix Heron, to rescue two young, fond hearts from destruction and despair.\" The impatience of Heron's companion vented itself in coarse expressions.\" \" Good gracious !\" he cried, \" what do yon want? You've had your answer, and now be off.\" \" Decidedly ! He is an inch thick with dust, and wants to beg a crown of us !\" Tho travel-worn young man's voice now seemed almost to fail him, for, although by tho movement of his Ups they could see that he was speaking, the words he uttered did not reach them. It was evident, too, that he leant more heavily upon tho gate. \" I will address him,\" said Heron. \" Wait for me a moment.\" The young man raised himself up from his leaning posture on the gate proudly. \" Perhaps even now,\" he said, \" I am not so weary and travel-worn but I can punish insolence like yours.\" He dashed tho gate open, evidently with a well practised hand. \" Nay \u2014 nay ! Leave him alone \u2014 thero is no time to lost. Sir Marmaduke will get impa tient.\" \" Let him !\" \" Now \u2014 now, this is too bad ! We must not let"], [243, "237 EDITH HERON. but to sacrifice his life there and then, upon that green lawn, was quite another affair. Heron's companion shrunk back. \" Confound the beggar's insolence !\" he said. \" Knock him on the head !\" His great effort seemed to be to shrink into as small a compass as possible. There was something ludicrous, too, about the manner in which he took off his hat and held it between his eyes and tho point of Heron's pistol, as though that would save him, in the event of a shot. \" Not yet,\" said Heron. \" I want to give him full information first.\" \" Him? \u2014 him information?\" \" Certainly ! You must know, young sir, that the Lady Gertrude is about this day to marry her cousin Marmaduke, a young officer in the Indian army.\" The travel-worn stranger glared at Heron as though newly-awakened from a dream. \" What I tell you is true ; and if you look up wards to the topmost turret, yosi will see a white flag there flying, which has been opened to the breeze by the Lady Gertrude herself only within the last five minutes, to welcome tho arrival of her cousin.\" \" What have I done,\" he said, in a whining tone, \u2014 \"what have I done to you tlrat I should be threatened in this way ?\" \" Beware !\" said Heron. \" And let that word suffice for you ! You know your danger ! Your Use is in your own keeping ! I om not a man of many words, but prompt in action !\" The young officer, for such indeed he was, seemed, in the excitement of the moment, to over come all his fatigue. \" Five minutes ? Why, it is but since that time that I have come within sight of the old, well-remembered house.\" He rushed forward, and grasped the arm of Heron, as he exclaimed, \" For the lovo of heaven, sir, let me know what. aU this means ? Am I awake, or is this some vision of a weary slumber by the roadside ?\" \" It is true enough,\" said Heron. \" Do you not see the flag ?\" \"Idol\u2014 I do!\" \" You ?\" shouted Heron's companion. \" And who may you be ?\" \" My name is Marmaduke ; and I am the cousin of the Lady Gertrude.\" Heron's companion opened his mouth ; but his surprise and consternation were too great at the moment to supply him with any expression strong enough to give utterance to them. He wheeled his horse round at onco to make for the Abbey. \"It waves for you.\" \" Oh, in mercy, do not tantalize me ! Give me but a key to all this mystery ; and let me at once he the happiest or the most wretched of mortals ?\" But that was a step easier to project than to execute. \"You shall have a key to it.

The bright daylight fell full upon the highly polished barrel of one of those long, slender pocket-pistols which Heron called pecuUarly his own. \" Alas ! \u2014 alas ! Why was she not true ?\" \" What mean you ?\" \" Lool^at me sir. Study me well. I am weak, travel-worn, and wretched. I have deserted an honourable profession, and thrown myseU a wan derer upon the world, merely that I might seek her, and hear from her own Ups if a terrible letter sho sent me could really convey the senti ments of her heart.\" \"Not yet, U you please,\" said Heron, abruptly. He had kept his eye upon Sir Marmadukc's villanous associate, and saw that he was makiug a very slow movement to escape. Without the slightest tremor or wavering, the muzzle pointed clearly at the head of the startled horsemau, who pulled up so rapidly that for a few seconds his horse looked exceedingly pic turesque with his fore-feet in the air. \" Attempt to stir an inch,\" added Heron, \" or make tho least outcry, or show by action, or even by look, that you meditate mischief, and I will scatter your brains upon this green-sward as certainly as that the sun now shines above us!\" The steady look of Heron. The tone in whicli he spoke. The cool, determined aim of the pistol, and the extraordinary leap that Daisy had taken, aU com bined to strike teiTor into this man. \"I give in \u2014 I give in!\" cried the fellow, in terror. \" Don't fire.\" \" Now go on, Mr. Marmaduke,\" said Heron. \" What letter is this you talk of ?\" \" I know you not; but I feel that I can trust you. It is here.\" As he spoke, the young officer produced a torn and crumpled letter from the breast of his dust begrimed apparel. He handed it to Heron with ghstening eye. and trembUng hand. \" Hark you, young sir !\" said Heron : \" in me you find a frieud ; and it shall go hard if within the next half -hour I do not prove myseU to be one such as in your wildest dreams you have scarcely hoped to look upon. But you must do something for yourself.\" \" Put me to the test, sir.\" He was completely awed. All the cowardice that lay at the bottom of the heart of the bully and the bravo rose up now, to the extinction of every other feehng. How it was that the man who he thought was associated with him in the rascally service of Sir Marmaduke Shuldham, should now turn both upon him and his employer, was a mystery which he could not solve. But there was the fact. Ho was ready for any fraud or any vfllany, \" I will do so. Take this pistol \u2014 or perhaps you are armed yourself ?\""], [244, "238 EDITH HERON. \"Alas ! no ; I think if I had been, it would have been against myself.\" \" Take this, then, and keep a good watch over that man.

You understand me ?\" \" I do, sir.\" CHAPTER CCLX FELIX HEKON IS THE MEANS OF UNITING TWO FOND HEARTS. And the plot would have succeeded. It must have succeeded but for two accidents. One was that Heron was mistaken for the un- The young officer took the pistol that Heron tendered him, and effectuaUy kept at bay the man who had fancied himself so well suited with a companion in FeUx Heron. scrupulous assistant from London in Sir Marma duke's service. The other was that the young Indian officer, instead of perhaps seeking the oblivion of death, and ridding himseU of Use and despair together upon some battle-field, threw up his commission, and determined to hear from the lips of Gertrude herself the terrible words that she no longer loved him. The letter which the young officer had pro duced was certainly in a very dilapidated condi tion, and consequently difficult to read; but Heron contrived to make i> __t as foUows : \u2014 \u00bb The Abbey. \" Marmaduke, \" Time was when I thought that I loved you. \" There are periods in the lives of boys and girls when they are pecuUarly susceptible of the tender passion; and, thrown together as we were during that period, in the solitude and seclusion of a large country house \u2014 dependent upon each other for all the society we saw \u2014 it is no wonder that we fancied ourselves madly devoted to each other. And here he was at that critical moment, with a heart heavy with despair, little suspecting-that that white flag flaunting from the topmost tower of the Abbey was to him a beacon of joy and happiness. Heron looked at him with a smile. An expression of surprise came over the fea tures of the young officer. \" Is it possible,\" he said, \" that you can find in the miseries of any one a subject for laugh ter?\" \" That dream has passed away. \" I hope and trust it has passed away with both of us as it has with me. And now that I am no longer a child, but looking forward to a Me of usefulness and domesticity, I think it but proper to write to you to say, that should you re-visit England, as my cousin Marmaduke you are quite welcome, but in no other capacity. \" Hoping that this wUl find you in just the frame of mind to receive such a communication, and that, therefore, you will send me no more letters simUar to your last, I beg to subscribe myseU \" Your affectionate cousin, \" Not laughter,\" repUed Heron ; \" but permit me to smile at your happiness.\" \" Happiness !\" \" Yes ; in the f uU sense of the word.\" \" You jest with me.\" \" No. Step aside.\" \" But this man ?\" \" Since our constant watchfulness of him, although necessary, becomes an annoyance, we must dispose of him in some other fashion.\" \" Do not kUl him.'-' \" Such carrion is not worth powder and shot. Dismount sir, or take the consequences !\" The man got off his horse with precipitation. \" You see,\" he said, \" I obey you in all things; therefore, there is no excuse for you iU-using me.\" f \" Gertrude.\" This letter for a few moments, but only for a few moments, staggered FeUx Heron. It was so coel, so curt, and the hand in which ft was written was so deUcate and so feminine, that he might weU be excused for asking himself U it were really the composition and inditing of the person whose signature it bore. But while this dubious condition of Heron's mind lasted he glanced upwards. \" StiU, Daisy, still !\" Heron dismounted likewise, and he knew that after what he had said Daisy would not stir an inch from the spot on which he left her. Heron then slipped the bridle from Sir Marma duke's man's horse, and with that and the stirrup leathers he was well provided with ample means of not only binding tho fellow's hands behind him, but of fastening him securely to a young tree. Upwards to the high turret of the Abbey. There was the flag. The white flag of lasting love and confidence, fluttering in the breeze. Could he doubt any longer ? \u25a0No. The letter which he held ia 'uis hand. and which had been addressed to the young officer in Calcutta, was as much a forgery as that a copy of which had been shown to him, Heron, by the man who now trembled beneath the barrel of the pistol held poinf blank at his head by the young officer. And Heron adopted the best possible mode of so fastening him. He rather tightly buckled one of the stirrup leathers round his neck, and round the tree like wise; so that whatever efforts he might make for his extrication would go just so far towards his strangulation. \" Now,\" said Heron, \" I sincerely advise you to keep quiet; or, otherwise, when we return, which assuredly we shaU, your condition will not bo changed for tho better.\" \" The game's up !\" growled the fellow. \" You are right.\" \" I don't know who and what you are,\" he added, \"except that you are no friend of Sir The whole plot, in its wicked and villanous ramifications, was now as evident to Heron as the bright sunlight that spankled upon the green h.wn at Daisy's feet."], [245, "239 KDITH HERON.

Come this way, young sir, and I shaU be able to teU you sufficient to drive away that look of care and depression from your brow.\" Heron took the bndle of Daisy over his arm, and he and the young officer walked towards the Abbey slantways over the beautiful lawn. Then Heron paused abruptly. \" One moment,\" he said. \"Stay by my horse, and I wUl rejoin you instantly.\" Heron darted back to the man whom he had \" What would you say ?\" \"Simply that I am seme years your senior in years, and that I suspect I have seen much more of life than you have ; so that I am justi fied in asking you to allow me to arrange this affair in my own fashion.\" \" I am by far too happy, and too infinitely obliged to you, to say nay.\" \" That is agreed, then ?\" \" It is ; and all I stipulate for is, that I may have as early an opportunity as possible of as suring my cousin Gertrude how dear she is to me, and how constantly her image has been my companion when so far distant from her.\" \" You shall have that opportunity quickly, be assured ; and now, as you know that Gertrude is willing to wed you in the old chapel, beUeving you to be fearfuUy disfigured by wounds, I want you to carry out that ceremony as you are.\" \"Ah, if I could!\" left tied to the sapling. \" Give me,\" he said, \" that copy of a letter which was forged in the name of her cousin Marmaduke, and addressed to the Lady Ger trude.\" \" It shall be done.\" \" You transport me with joy !\" \" Calm yourseU, and leave all to me. I wfll take good care that you stand by the altar in Ueu of Sir Marmaduke Shuldham.\" \" How can I give it,\" growled the fellow, \" with my hands tied behind me?\" Heron then recollected that he had seen him put it in the breast-pocket of his apparel ; and forcing open his coat, he quickly possessed him self of it. By this time, they had reached a Uttle antique, arched door, covered with huge nails, and which was likewise so embosomed in ivy that it was difficult to detect it at all. Making his way back, then, to the young officer, Heron placed it in his hands, saying, \" This is the copy of a letter forged by Sir Mar maduke Shuldham, the guardian of Gertrude, and presented to her as coming from you. Bead it, and one-haU of the plot will be apparent ; whUe, for the other half, you must Ukewise look in the other forged letter, which you have just shown me, and which purports to come from ha* to you.\" \" Great heaven ! Can such things be ?\" >^ \" Bead \u2014 read, and convince yourseU.\" With evident signs of agitation, the young man read this infamous epistle. Then the whole truth seemed to flash upon him. \"This,\" said the young officer, \" is one of the entrances to the ancient chapel ; and it is one so Uttle known, and so seldom used, that I dare say no one but ourselves, on this occasion, will enter by it\" \" I nave one perplexity,\" said Heron \u2014 \" my horse.\" \" It wUl be safe here. This shadowy path that we have just traversed has, time out of mind, been beUeved by the whole household to be haunted ; and I wiU take upon myseU to say that, even at this nearly mid-day hour, no one wUl venture hither.\" \" Then, Daisy, wait for me,\" said Heron. There was an iron ring deeply embedded in the stone wall by the side of the ancient Gothic door, and through that Heron shpped Daisy's bridle. His eyes became radiant with joy. \" She is true yet !\" he cried ; \" and goodness, sincerity, and virtue have not yet forsaken the world !\" \"Now,\" he said, \"let us make our way into this mysterious chapel.\" The door yielded to a touch, creaking slightly on its hinges ; and proceeding forward three steps, Heron and the young officer stood in a little ancient CathoUc oratory, which really needed but few artificial means to make it dim and obscure. \" Certainly not,\" said Heron. \"But this plot is about to be carried out, and the Lady Gertrude wUl be, in the darkened chapel, united to her guardian, to whom she will give her hand, sup posing him to he you.\" The young officer uttered a cry of such de spair that it alarmed Heron, and made Daisy prick up her ears, and look about her in wonder, to know what was the matter. \" Hasten ! \u2014 oh, let me hasten !\" he cried. \" With aU my heart!\" said Heron; \"although, in good truth, I know not the way.\" \" Know not the way to the old chapel of the Abbey? It is as famUiar to me as possible. This way \u2014 this way ! I passed many happy years of early Use in this mansion.\" The young officer turned to the left, and plunged into a narrow path, overshadowed with tall trees, and which had scarcely space enough for Daisy to move forward in. \" This way\u2014 this way ! We shall reach the chapel in a few seconds. \" One moment !\" said Heron. The narrow stained glass windows, each one of which represented a saint of solemn and majestic appearance, admitted but dimly the sun's rays even at their brightest and best. But now those windows were oovered with black serge, with the exception of one, which sent so dim a Ught of many colours through its stained compartments into the old chapel that almost absolute darkness would have been less confusing. \" Hush !\" whispered Heron ; \" there are two persons standing by the old altar's steps.\" The young officer and Heron paused ; and the latter could feel, as his companion grasped his arm, in what a state of nervous agitation he was."], [246, "240 EDITH IIEUON. \" By no means, Sir Marmaduke ; and now that you find my hand upon your throat, and feel its pressure, the propriety of submission wfll per haps be evident.\" A strange, gurgling sound was the only reply from Sir Marmaduke, for Heron's clutch upon his throat was far from being the most gentle in the world. \" Be calm \u2014 be calm !\" \"You do not know what I have suffered. Who are those persons we see yonder?\" \" They are speaking. Listen, and we shall soon know.\" The two persons spoke, but in whispers ; yet the profound stillness and repose of the Uttle oratory was such that Heron and the young officer had no difficulty in catching every word they uttered. Sir Marmaduke was a heavy man, but Heron, by an exertion of that wonderful strength he pos sessed, fairly lifted him out of the chapel and flung him down at the feet of Daisy. \" Look to him, Daisy!\" cried Heron. \"Keep him, lass!\" It was a trick which Daisy had been taught it Epping Forest, to hold any one. down with one ol her fore-feet, without exerting sufficient pressure to do any real mischief. Sir Marmaduke was safe. Another moment, and Heron was beside the young officer. \" I think,\" said one of the speakers, \" that your scruples now, at the eleventh hour, are uncaUed for. It is but a whim of the lady's ; and as everything else is regular, I cannot see that you run any risk in performing the cere mony.\" \" It is a serious thing to me if I do,\" replied the other person. \" But, greatly beholden as I -am to you, Sir Marmaduke, for many favours, I am not disposed to raise captious objections to this proceeding.\" \" That is. weU\u2014 that is well ! Tho lady will soon be here, and the ceremony can proceed.\" \" Now,\" whispered Heron to the young officer, \" you know who they are.\" \" The villanous Sir Marmaduke !\" \" Take your place at the altar,\" he whispered rapidly, _) and go through with the ceremony. Ii the clergyman speaks to you, answer as if you were Sir Marmaduke.\" The young man sprung forward, and in another second he stood before the clergyman, in the pre cise spot so recently occupied by Sir Marmaduke Shuldham. \" Yes ; and his friend, the clergyman, whe, you hear, shrinks somewhat from the part he has to play in this domestic drama.\" \" He will not play the part he expects.\" \" Only that he shall marry a Marmaduke to the Lady Gertrude, although it may not be the one he expects. And now let me make a bar gain with you.\" \"What is it?\" He was spared the necessity of playing a part repugnant to his feelings, for at that instant a distant door opened in the little chapel, and two female forms came into it. The foremost of these advanced with rapid steps to the altar and held out both her hands. \" Oh, Marmaduke, Marmaduke !\" she said, \" could you think it possible your own Gertrude ceuld be false to you, happen what might ?\" \"Hem!\" said the clergyman \u2014 for he had o terrible fear that some explanation might take place, terminating in the confusion of all con cerned ; for U he did not know exactly what was doing, he at all events must have strongly sus pected that some fraud was being enacted. But the darkness of the chapel was so intense that all these people now in it could scarcely be distinguished one from the other. For one brief moment Marmaduke clasped Ger trude to his heart, and she at least was assured that there was no mistake. \" Promise me that you will not say a word to undeceive Gertrude in regard to what she thinks is the exact state of the case untU after tho ceremony.\" \" I wUl obey you.\" \" Then wait here while I clear a place for you at the altar steps.\" Heron stepped lightly forward, amid the dim shadows of the chapel. \" Sir Marmaduke, Sir Marmaduke !\" he said ; \" if you please, something so important ! Sir Marmaduke, your attention for a moment'' Heron spoke in a tragic sort of wj._sper, which might be anybody's voice ; and the rather salarmed Sir Marmaduke Shuldham darted at once towards him, uttering an exclamation of impatience anything but -weU suited to the sacred place he was in. \" What is it ? What has happened ? Are you the new fellow from London, recommended by Wrench?\" \" Exactly, Sir Marmaduke ; but something has happened.\" \"What\u2014 what?\" Heron stepped forwardand gave away the bride. In seven minutes and a half exactly, Gertrude was the wUe of her cousin Marmaduke. Then Heron raised his voice to a shout that rang through the little chapel. \" Unmask those windows,\" he cried, \" and let us have aU the light we can !\" Some servants, who were in a small gallery of the chapel, hastily tore down at this command the serge blinds that darkened the windows. The change from nearly complete gloom to something like daylight was marked aud in stantaneous. \" Step this way, sir.\" \" What is it ? Can't you speak \u2014 the lady will be here directly.\" As Heron slowly retreated, Sir Marmaduke Shuldham followed him up involuntarily, until, iu truth, they were very near the little antique door at which he, Heron, and the young officer, had entered the chapel. \" Well\u2014 well\u2014 what is it ? Out with it !\" Gertrude uttered a cry of joy. \" You are not hurt \u2014 you are not disfigured Marmaduke!\" she cried. \" Oh, what a cruel jest was this !\" \"Nay, dear Gertrude, it was no jest of mine. I and this noble gentleman will explain all to you ; and surely all's well that ends well, when thus I clasp you to my heart !\" \" I don't, intend,\" said Heron, \" to let you marry the Lady Gertrude!\" \" Eh ?\""], [247, "241 EDITH HERON. \u00ab* But, Marmaduke, how strange you look in i_i_ _usty and travel-worn apparel \u2014 those hollow checks !

On the other side of the little antique door, how ever, Daisy stUl held Sir Marmaduke. indurance. \" Let him go, Daisy,\" said Heron ; \" and if you sir, have a particle of shame in your composition, fly from this spot ; for your ward, the Lady Ger- Heron then spoke, and in a few short sentences he contrived to give the Lady Gertrude a tole rably good idea of the plot to which she had so nearly fallen a victim. \" And now,\" he said, \" that aU has ended so No. 83. \u2014 Edith Heron."], [248, "EDITH HERON. 242 sigh; \" and when do you expect him to return, Ogle?\" Ogle had no occasion to reply to this question of Mrs. Bipon's, for at that moment Ogle recog nised the knock of Felix Heron at the haU door. trude, is really married to her cousin Marmaduke, and it might be well for your safety that he did not meet you.\" The discomfited guardian sprung to his feet, and rushed from the spot.

It must be understood that Mrs. Bipon had CHAPTEB CCLXI.

Mrs. Bipon has Game to teU U3 where he is.\" It was about mid-day on that morning which had been one of adventure for Captain Heron that an old woman, with grief and anxiety marked on her countenance, and ever and anon' uttering a deep groan, knocked at Whitcombe House. While Ogle was saying these few words, Mrs. Bipon, in a perfect agony of suspense, was look ing from one to the other of them. Heron could not help smUing, although his heart was heavy, -when he perceived tliat Mr?. Bipon, who knew him so well, had not penetrated Ogle, restless and uneasy, was pacing the hall, expecting Captain Heron's return with somo tidings of Tom. Ogle instantly opened the hall door, and for the first time in his Use felt almost tempted to embrace Mrs. Bipon, for he began to hope that after aU, Tom had been able to conceal himself at his mother's house ; and, at all events, that he had sent her to give him and Captain Heron in formation as regarded his whereabouts. \"Mrs. Eipon!\" was aU that Ogle could com mand his voice to say. Mrs. Bipon shook her head, and sinking into the haU porter's chair began to sob violently, rocking herseU backwards and forwards like some one in great physical suffering. his disguise. \" That is welL\" he said at last, speaking in his own voice. \" Do you know me now, Mrs. Eipon ?\" Mrs. Bipon burst out crying. The events of the morning had made her ner vous and excited, and she could scarcely beUeve her ears, when she recognised tho tones of FeUx Heron's voice. \"Good gracious, Captain!\" she exclaimed; \"who would have thought it was you ? I declare no body would know you.\" \" Enough, enough!\" said Felix Heron. \" Now tell me aU you know about Tom.\" Mrs. Bipon, in a short time, put FeUx Heron in possession of all that the reader is acquainted with, excepting as regards the fact of where Tom was really imprisoned. \" No doubt\" said Heron, \" Jonathan Wild has taken Tom to Newgate. I win go at once, Ogle, and demand to see the prisoner. I think I may safely trust to this disguise ?\" \" 1 should think so, Captain,\" said Ogle, in a dubious voice ; \"but I don't half Uke the idea of you venturing within those walls. Let me go?\" \"No, no!\" said Felix Heron. \"I must not lose you as well as Tom, and there's no knowing but that he might find some excuse for detaining you. I wiU just go and speak first to Edith, and then I wUl go at once and ask to see Tom Eipon.\" Edith met Captain Heron at the drawing-room door. She had heard his loved footstep ascending the stairs, and had hastened to meet him. \"What news, Felix?\" she asked, looking up into his face with a world of love in her glance. \"Speak, Mrs. Bipon !\" cried Ogle. \"Canyon teU me aught of your son Tom ?\" \" Alas, alas !\" said Mrs. Ogle, \" the poor, dear boy is caught at last ; and Jonathan Wild says he'll hang him, as sure as his name is Jonathan WUd !\" For a moment, Ogle's heart sank within him, but repressing his feelings, he said, \" TeU me, Mrs. Bipon, has Wild, then, captured the poor boy?\" \" Alas, yes ! Oh, oh, oh ! With aU his faults, he was a good son to me ; and to think that no body can save him now !\" \"Don't say that, Mrs. Bipon,\" said Ogle, with a deep-drawn sigh \u2014 \" don't say that Captain Heron is even now seeking him, and if he does not suc ceed in tracing him, he will soon be home ; and when he knows that WUd really has taken him prisoner, he will most Ukely be able to hit upon 6ome plan of setting him at Ubcrty again.\" When Mrs. Bipon heard that Felix Heron had gone in search of Tom, she started up, and ox claimed, \" Oh, aU will yet bo well. Ho suc ceeds in everything he undertakes; but I thought he would bo so angry with tho poor boy for ex posing Daisy to so much danger, that he would never forgive him, and let him take his chance with Jonathan Wild.\" \" I have brought no tidings, my Edith, of that reckless boy ; but Mrs. Bipon is below with Ogle, and she says he was captured at her house in Wardour Street, by Jonathan WUd, and that he is now in Newgate.\" \"Poor boy \u2014 poor boy!\" exclaimed Edith. \" What do you intend to do, Felix ?\" Felix hesitated a moment, for he knew he was about to undertake something hazardous. \" No fear of that, Mrs. Eipon,\" replied Oglo. u It is quite certain the Captain was very angry at first with Tom, when he heard of his taking Daisy on the road; but he has too great a regard for Tom to allow him to fall a viclim to Jona than Wild, without making an effort to save him.\" He is a noblo man,\" said Mrs. Bipon, with a"], [249, "243 EDITH HERON. Wild's house, or Little Newgato, as he called it- _.' . Edith instantly understood his silence. \"You will not go, Felix \u2014 you wiU not go there, Felix !\" she said \u2014 and there was a percep tible tremor in her voice. As FeUx Horon turned from tho gates of New gate, he began to ask himseU what he had better do next. He knew it would be fruitless to attempt to gain admittance in the ordinary way to any pri soner whom Jonathan Wild chose, for purposes of bis own, to confine within the precincts of his own house. Felix folded her to his heart as he whis pered, \" Is my Edith going to turn coward now, my brave Edith ? Must poor Tom be lest without one effort to save him ? Bemember what he has been to both of us.\" \"I know \u2014 I know!\" said Edith ; \"but may I I not go, Felix ? I could say something to com fort him, and no one co.lC interfere with me.\" \" I am not so sure of that, Edith,\" said Heron, mournfuUy. \" It will never do, I am convinced, for you \u2014 the bride of Captain Fantome \u2014 to go to Newgate to see Tom Eipon. Wild wouid begin to have his suspicions aroused imme diately.\" Edith raised her head, which she had rested upon Felix Heron's shoulder ; and, looking him steadfastly in tha face, she said, \" Go then, Felix. I wUl not strive to hinder you performing what you consider a duty ; but, oh ! be wary ; and be specially careful to disguise your voice as much as possible.\" \" Never fear, Edith ! Why, even Mrs. Eipon did not know me ! So cheer up, and believe that I shall be able to bring back good tidings of poor Tom.\" At last Felix Heron came to the determination of paying his friend the young Earl of Bridge water a visit, for the purpose of obtaining an order from a judge to search Jonathan Wild's house, U he (Wild) refused to admit him at once to Tom's cell. A rapid walk soon brought him to the door o\u00a3 his friend's house, who was at the moment de scending the grand staircase, and it was quite evident to Captain Heron by the look of inquiry upon the face of his friend, the Earl of Bridge water, that he was so weU disguised as Captain Fantome that even his most intimate friend faUed to recognise him. The footman who had admitted Felix Heron ushered him into the library, where he was soon joined by the Earl of Bridgewater. \" Thank you, Bridgewater,\" said Heron, as soon as they were alone, \" for puttng me per fectly at my easo with regard to my new dis guise.\" This was said in FeUx Heron's natural voice, and instantly his hand was grasped by his friend Bridgewater. \" Go at once, FoUx ; for well I know how much he is suffering now from remorse at having given you so much anxiety and \" Edith paused. \" And what ?\" asked Heron. \" Is it possible ?\" said Bridgewater, laughing, \" that I could forget your intention of assuming a new disguise. I had quite forgotten it at the moment, and did not recognise you. What is it you have come to say, for I can see that some thing sits very heavy on your heart ?\" \" In truth, I am somewhat depressed, I behove ; but I want you, Bridgewater, to obtain for me, from your friend Sir Eeginald, an order to search Jonathan WUd's house.\" \" Don't be very angry with him, Felix : he is but a boy, after all ; and the temptation to become as celebrated as his loved Captain Heron has been too great to resist.\" \"Never fear, Edith,\" replied Heron. \" All the anger I felt has passed away, and I only re member tho boy's devotion and indomitable courage. FareweU, my Edith ; I shaU soon re turn to you.\" Heron made his way towards Newgate, with the intention of seeing Tom Eipon\u2014 for he now entertained no doubt on tho subject that he was there a prisoner \u2014 not only to say a few kind words to him, of which he felt assured he stood so much in need, but to see what terms might be offered Jonathan WUd, in order to induce him to set him at liberty. \" Ah ! Is there any one there in whom you are interested, Whitcombe ?\" \" Tom Eipon.\" \"Indeed!\" \" Yes ; the foolish boy took the mad freak into his head, of going on the road and seeking his own fortunes unknown to anybody, and this is the result of his undertaking.\" The Earl of Bridgewater looked cencerned, as he said, \" But are you sure he is there ? Has he communicated with you?\" \" No,\" replied FeUx Heron ; \" we found out, by tbe merest accident in the world, that ho had been captured, by Daisy returning early yesterday morning, alone.\" \" What ! Did he take Daisy ?\" FeUx Heron knocked for admittance at New gate. The little wicket was opened, and a man thrust out his head, insolently demanding \" What now ?\" No sooner, however, did this man perceive a gentleman in an uniform belonging to the royal navy, than he instantly changed his tone, and asked civilly enough, \" WTio do you please to want 6ir?\" \" I have come to see a prisoner, a mere boy, who was brought here yesterday by Jonathan Wild's orders.\" \" Beg, pardon, sir ; but there's some mistake. There was no such person as you speak of brought here.\" \" He did; but, as I was saying, whUe I ha<_ gone out on the road to see if I could hear any tidings of him, his mother, Mrs. Eipon, came to my house, and told Ogle that Wild had had him taken to Newgate.\" \" Then what makes you think he is oonfined in Jonathan Wild's house ?\" asked the Earl of Bridgewater. \" Indeed !\" said Heron. A cold feeUng was at the heart of Felix Heron as he heard these words, for he now had no doubt but that Tom Eipon had been conveyod to \" Because I have already been to Newgate, and' was told that no such person as I described had been taken in.\""], [250, "EDITH HERON. 244 in order to hear all that was said, unseen by the parties who demanded admittance. The Earl of Bridgewater addressed the man who acted as porter or goalor. \" We wish to see a boy who was brought here yesterday, of the name of Bipon.\" \" Bipon ? Eipon ?\" said the man, with an inquiring look at WUd, of course unseen by either the Earl of Bridgewater or FeUx Heron- Jonathan WUd shook his head to intimate to the man that he was to say he was not there. \"Now make haste and open the door,' said the Earl of Bridgewater; \"we are not going to wait here aU day parleying with you. We know he is here, and if you do not let us see him by fair means, we wUl by foul ; for we are prepared with an order from Sir Eeginald Selby to search every corner of this den until we do find him.\" \" I will be with you instantly. Wait here one moment.\" . The young Earl of Bridgewater soon made his appearance, ready equipped for a visit to his friend, Sir Eeginald Selby, one of the judges. A brisk walk soon brought Felix Heron and his friend, the young Earl of Bridgewater, to the judge's mansion. The Earl of Bridgewater was instantly ad- mitted, and was shown into the library, where, seated at a table, covered with papers, was Sir Reginald Selby. \" Ah, Bridgewater !\" said Sir Eeginald, as he rose and extended his hand ; \" I am glad to see you. To what am I indebted for this visit ?\" The Earl of Bridgewater, in taking the hand Sir Bsginald had held out to him, turned to Felix Heron, and said, \"Allow me, Sir Eeginald, to introduce to you my particular friend, Captain Fantome.\" \" An order!\" said the man, haU alarmed. \" Get out of the way !\" growled 'Wild, as he now showed himself. \" Get out of the way, and let mo speak to the gentlemen !\" Jonathan Wild began to have some uncomfort able feeling with regard to the visit of two gentlemen ; but when he saw that Captain Fan tome, the husband of the Countess of Whitcombe, was one of his visitors, ho was, so to speal. thrown off his guard. Sir Eeginald bowed. \"Any friend of the Earl of Bridgewater I shall be happy at all times to receive as mine.\" FeUx Heron bowed courteously, and speaking for the-first time, he said, \" I am about, then, Sir Eeginald, to ask a favour of you ; which is, to give me an order to search the house of the notorious thief-taker, Jonathan Wild.\" \" Indeed !\" \" Open the door instantly,\" ho cried, \" and show the gentlemen into the office.\" \" Yes, Sir Eeginald,\" interposed the Earl of Bridgewater. \" This gentleman has every reason to believe that a youth of whom he knows something, has been taken to what is called 'Little Newgate,' which is no other than the house of Jonathan Wild ; and where he has the means of carrying out the pains and penalties of tho larger prison, for his own mere gratifica tion.\" CHAPTER CCLXII. FELIX HERON AND THE EARL OF BRIDGEWATER FIND TOM RIPON SUSPENDED FROM A NAIL IN THE WALL IN A CELL ES IONATIIAN WH.D'S MOUSE. \" I have heard as much,\" replied Sir Eeginald Selby ; \" but we wiU frustrate his plans in this case, U possible. Are you sure that the lad of whom you speak is really in Little Newgate ?\" \" Quite sure,\" repUed FeUx Heron ; \" for I went, in the first instance, to Newgate before troubling the Earl of Bridgewater, and was told by the men on the lock that no such person as I mentioned had been admitted.\" The office was originaUy intended as a sitting room, but when WUd found that his own private business increased, he thought it advisable to turn this room into a kind of office, where he kept an old man as clerk, whose duty it was to receive aU visitors, whether to Mr. WUd per sonaUy or officially. \" Then it is pretty clear,\" said Sir Eeginald. \" I wUl write you an order immediately.\" Going, then, to the table on which were writing materials, Sir Eeginald Selby sat do-gfi and wrote an order, by which FeUx Heron and the Earl of Bridgewater were empowered to search the house of Jonathan WUd. As soon as Felix Heron and his young friend the Earl of Bridgewater were once more in the street, tha latter turned to Heron, and said, \" I will go with you, Whitcombe, it you \u25a0will allow me.\" The room was barely furnished. The floor was sanded, and a round table and a couple of chairs was all the furniture it contained, with the exception of a desk and a high stool, upon which perched the clerk. Felix Heron and tho Earl of Bridgewater entered, but it was Felix who first addressed Jonathan WUd. \" We have come to see a boy whom you have here, Jonathan WUd, by the name of Tom Eipon. It is useless for you to attempt to deny having him in custody, for wo have proofs of his being here, and are determined to see him, and U need be take him away with us.\" Wild, during this speech, quietly seated himself on the table, swinging his legs backward and forwards, and every now and then giving one of those leers out of the corner of his eye, which he seemed to think rather an improvement to his looks than otherwise. \" Thank you \u2014 thank you !\" cried Heron. \" I did not Uke to ask you to do so ; but still, U y ou feel inclined to assist me in this search, I shaU be well pleased.\" \" Say no more about it, Whitcombe ; say no more about it.\" In a very short space of time, Felix Heron and his friend tho Earl of Bridgewater ascended the steps of Wild's house. \" So you have come to see Tom Eipon, hav\u00ab you ?\" asked Wild. \" We have,\" repUed the Earl of Bridgewater. They knocked at the door. At the same moment that the little wicket was opened, Jonathan Wild ghded into the passage,"], [251, "245 EDITH IIEKON. \" You do not deny that he is here in this house ?\" up to the naU he had seen on first entering the cell. \"Oh, no!\" coolly replied Jonathan WUd. \" He is here, and no mistake, and here he will re main ; but I have no objection to you seeing him, I was actuated by motives of kindness towards the boy. and brought him here in order to keep him from further mischief, and bringing himseU to the gaUows before bis time.\" \" SUence !\" said Felix Heron. \" Lead the way to Tom Eipon, or as sure as you are sitting there, I wUl find the means to make you.\" Jonathan Wild did not seem inclined to put himseU in the power of his visitors, so he shouted out, \"Here, Jenkins \u2014 Jenkins, show these gentlemen to Tom Eipon's ceU, and take care the young scoundrel does not make his escape.\" Along a narrow passage and down a flight of stone steps, which Felix Heron knew but too welL the man Jenkins led the way to Tom's ceU. Arrived at a low door, studded with nails, tho man stopped and produced from his belt a huge bunch of keys. Selecting one of these, he thrust it into the lock, leaving FeUx Heron and the Earl of Bridgewater to enter by themsel#s, whUe he remained on guard outside. He was soon startled by a cry of horror which came from the hearts of Felix Heron and the Earl of Bridgewater. \" Ah !\" he said, \" there it is, looking quite in viting. I've a good mind to try it on. There's nobody to care for me. The old gal and that old hypocrite, Mortification, wUl drink their rum punch just as well when I am gone. There's Ogle, certainly, and there's Daisy.\" At the mention of Daisy the boy bowed his head upon his hands, and great tears dropped through his fingers. \"Dear, dear Daisy!\" continued Tom; \"U I could but know that you were safe and weU, I could die cheerfuUy. If I could but get out of here for a few houre, and satisfy myself that she was all right, I wouldn't mind a bit coming back again.\" Tom seemed lost in thought. In a few minutes he raised his head. \" Ah, a happy thought ! I have it ! Yes, yes, I'll manage it! Ha! ha, Jonathan Wild ! I wiU be as clever as Jonathan Wild !\" With these words, Tom Bipon began by taking off his tall jack-boots, bis scarlet coat, cravat and wig. He then went to the straw, npon which he had vainly attempted to sleep, and taking up in his arms a large quantity, commenced stuffing his coat with it. Having done so, he fastened on the boots, and placed on the top of all his hat and wig. Having made this effigy of himself, Tom tied it up to the nail which projected from the waU, and then stood some paces off to admire his handiwork. \"Eh? What? What's the matter?\" asked the man, as Felix Heron and the Earl of Bridge . water rushed by him. \" What's up ?\" At a glance, the sight which was presented to the gaoler was one sufficient to account for the cry of horror which had burst simultaneously from the lips of both FeUx and his friend the young Earl. Tom Eipon was suspended from a nail in the waU, and from the stUlness of every limb it was evident that he was quite dead. Jenkins did not stop many minutes to examine the dead body, but made what haste he could to regain the room in which he and the visitors had left Jonathan WUd, and where he had no doubt of finding them. \" That's about it,\" exclaimed Tom. \" Quite a handsome-looking fellow, I declare ! I don't wonder U all the girls fall in love with me. Now, Johnny, U you would but come into the cell, perhaps you might be too frightened to give the alarm, and I shall manage to escape.\" These cogitations of Tom's were brought to an abrupt conclusion by the sound of footsteps in the stone passage just outside Tom's ceU. \"Ah!\" said Tom; \"here's somebody. Ill just hide behind the door, and watch my oppor tunity.\" Tom Eipon had just time to get behind the ceU-door, when the key was thrust into the lock to admit Felix Heron and his friend, the Earl of \" Bless my heart, now, who'd have thought it ? A young fellow who would have made his fortune twenty times over, U he'd only just have humoured Jonathan Wild a bit. WeU, it's no use a locking up of a dead body, so here goes !\" The last three words were intended as a kind of incentive to himself to hurry from that ceU which contained so ghastly a spectacle, for he never ceased running until he gained the room where he heard an altercation going on between the two gentleman and Jonathan WUd. It is now time that we return to Tom Eipon, who, it must bo confessed, for the first time in his Use, found it impossible to call to his aid any of that joyousness and love of fun and mischief which seemed always at his command, no matter what were the circumstances in which he was placed. Bridgewater. Our readers are aware of the result of Tom's ingenuity fn imposing upon them, for they reaUy beheved that it was Tom who was thus hanging \u2014 a victim of Jonathan Wild's hatred and malice. It was with mixed feeUngs of joy and sorrow that Tom Bipon heard the exclamations of FeUx Heron and his friend, for it convinced Tom that whatever cause FeUx Heron had for visiting him with his just anger, he stUl felt convinced that that cry which had come from the heart of his beloved master had in it tones of affection only, and none of anger. It is difficult to say what Tom Eipon might not have done under the circumstances, but the inopportuue appearance of the turnkey as Felix Heron uttered that cry of dismay, prevented him (Tom) from throwing himself at FeUx Heron's feet, and asking his forgiveness. After trying most unsuccessfuUy to make some impression upon the lock, Tom threw tho nail down in despair, exclaiming, \" It's no use ! I know Captain Heron will never forgive me, so what's the use of living ?\" At this moment Tom happened to cast his eyes As it was, Tom Eipon had just time sufficient"], [252, "246 EDITH HERON. to hide himseU behind the door of his cell, where he could hear the little colloquy of the turnkey, and was himseU unobserved. In the meantime Tom Eipon had taken an exploring fit into his head, hoping that he might perchance find some mode of egress from his pre sent abode, which, to tell the truth, was not a de sirable one, Tom thought. Tom had made his way after Jonathan WUd, slowly and stealthily, intending, it possible, to watch for an opportunity of stepping out at the same time that Jonathan Wild left his house. It was with a feeling of satisfaction that Tom heard the retreating footsteps of the man Jenkins, and this feeUng was greatly increased when he found he had not attempted to draw the door shut behind him. Tom Bipon allowed a reasonable time to elapse before he ventured out of his place of conceal ment ; he then quietly returned to the hanging figure which he had suspended trom the naiL and which had produced so much alarm to Felix Heron and the young Earl ot Bridgewater. Tom then proceeded to take down the figure, and again dressed himseU in his coat, hat, wig, and boots, and sat down to think what he had best do next. In fact, it was Tom who had just pushed open the door of the room in which Wud was, which had so startled him, Wild. Tom was so situated that he could see and hear all Jonathan Wild said and did, without him self being seen. Jonathan Wild continued. \" Yes ; I suppose I shall see his ghost some day. Though I didn't kiU him, that's quite certain ; but stfll I dragged him here, and shut him up, when, after all, tho boy was only doing what I would have given him free liberty to do, if he would have accepted my terms.\" Tom scraped with his naU upon the panel of the door, and gave a deep sigh. Jonathan WUd cowered down as though he had been struck by some invisible hand. \" Murder ! Help ! help r* Tom Bipon opened the door, and walked into the room, looking solemn and mysterious. He had totaUy altered his appearance by the addition of a large quantity of whitewash, which he had gathered from the waUs of his cell, and which he had rubbed profusely aU over bis face, giving it an unearthly appearance. \" What want you, Jonathan WUd?\" asked Tocr, in a low gutteral voice. \"Back! back! Spare me! spare me!\" shriek _d WUd. \"Let me go! let me go !\" The only answer Tom gave was another deep groan, and then he closed the door and placed his back against it. \"MercUul heavens!\" cried Jonathan Wild. \" What want you here ? I did not kill the boy ! I offered to let him go free U \u2014 if \" \"If what?\" asked Tom again, with a deep groan. His best plan, Tom thought, would be to wait until dusk before he attempted to make his es cape from Jonathan Wild's house ; but whUe waiting for the hour to arrive, he did not feel in clined to sit down patiently, and do nothing. And now that Tom had some hopes of again seeing his four-footed friend Daisy, it was re markable how changed he was in aspect, and how soon he recovered his wonted gaiety of disposi tion. Tom started to his feet ; for he fancied he heard Jonathan Wild's voice close to his ceU door, which Tom had partiaUy closed. \" HUloa there, Jenkins !\" said Jonathan Wild. \" Coming, sir ! coming, sir !\" repUed Jenkins. \" Well, make haste, then,\" again shouted Wild, \" and don't keep one here waiting all day. Let no one go to the ceU \u2014 that cell wherein Tom Bipon has put an end to himseU\u2014 -till my return. You understand, eh ?\" \"All right, Mr. Wild. We are none of us likely to choose that cell now to pass the time in. We don't care for Uve folks, but dead ones \" \"SUence!\" roared WUd. \"What do I care for your likes or dislikes ? If you say another word, 111 make you keep watch over the body until I come back.\" It was evident to Jenkins and his comrades that for some reason or another Jonathan Wild was more vexed than pleased at what had that morning occurred ; and knowing the hostility that had always existed between Jonathan WUd and Tom Bipon, they were at a loss to understand why his death should so affect him, Wild. If we follow him, the reader wiU gather some what from his own words. \" If \u2014 U Murder !\" Tom approached close to the table. \"Murder! Keep back, I say! What want you with me ?\" \" I am sent by Captain Felix Heron,\" said Tom, \" to tell you that your last hour is near at hand ; and that you are to go to the cell in which you caused Tom Eipon to be placed \" Jonathan WUd stood with open mouth and eyes dilated as he cried, \" But you are Tom Eipon ! Say it is all a terrible joke, and I \" \"I was Tom Bipon,\" repUed Tom, with solemnity, \"but Tom Bipon is now no more !\" Jonathan WUd shook as with an ague. \" You are to go,\" said Tom, in a low, solemn voice, \"to the ceU in which you confined Tom Eipon, and take from the pooket of the coat which he wore when he hanged himseU a paper \" \" A paper 7' \"Yes.\" \" Plague take the boy !\" muttered WUd to him seU, as he paced up and down his own particular room. \" Plague tako tho boy, to go and hang himself just at this juncture, when I had him so completely in my power ! I would have forced him to teU mo what he meant by Felix Heron coming to claim Daisy himseU.\" Jonathan Wild paused and looked uneasily round the apartment. \" Ghosts ! What folly ! there are not such things. And yet \u2014 and yet What's that?\" Jonathan Wild turned twice round on his heel, as the door of the room creaked a littlo ou its hinges. \" I will send for it, good spirit \u2014 I will send for it. But go away now \u2014 pray go away, and I promise to be a friend to poor Mrs. Ripon as long \"Oh, only the wind!\" aud then Jonathan Wild gat down to think. as I Uve.\""], [253, "247 EDrrn heron. Tom Eipon raised both his hands and pointed meaningly to the door. Jonathan Wild understood the action, but really had not tho power to move. \" Thanks \u2014 a thousand thanks, true and valued friend,\" repUed Felix Heron, as he took the proffered hand of the young Earl of Bridgewater, and pressing it warmly, turned his face with a heavy heart towards Whitcombe House. A very short space of time sufficed to bring Felix Heron to the door of the mansion, which was quickly opened by Ogle, without Felix Heron having had time to knock for admittance. Ogle had stationed himseU by one ef the side windows in the hall, where he could command a good view of the street, and being more than usually anxious about Tom, he could not make up his mind to go about his usual vocations until he had heard some tidings about him. A glance at the sorrow-stricken face of Felix Heron sufficed to let Ogle know that something unusual had happened. \" Go !\" said Tom, still in the same voice. Wild got up from the chair on which he had sunk, and was about to make his way to tho door, hoping that he would thus put an end to the ghostly interview, when Tom placed his hand heavily on his arm, saying as he did so, \"Beware, Jonathan Wild!\" That was an unlucky step of Tom's, for Jonathan WUd's nerves were so tightly strung by this time, that he could bear no more, but utter ing one loud shriek, f eU to the floor insensible. That shriek brought several of the turnkeys to his assistance, and Tom Eipon was again sur rounded, even as he had been once before that day, and borne to a ceU stUl more lonely than the one he had just quitted. \" There you are, my fine feUow !\" said one of the men, as he shpped some heavy handcuffs upon Tom's wrists. \" Perhaps, when you tries to frighten folks again, you'll manage matters better than you have this time !\" \" What news, Captain ?\" exclaimed Ogle, as he opened the door. \" As bad os it can well be, Ogle,\" said Felix Heron, sorrowfully. \" The poor boy is no more.\" Ogle fairly reeled against the waU as Captain Heron uttered these words, and for a moment they seemed to take from him aU powers of utterance. Then dashing his hand across his eyes, he said, \"No more? \u2014 Tom Eipon no more, Captain? What do you mean ?\" \" I mean,\" said Heron, with a trembling voice, \" that the poor boy has destroyed himself in Jonathan Wild's house.\" CHAPTEE CCLXIII. FELIX HERON MAKES KNOWN TO EDITH AND OGLE THE RESULT OF HIS VISIT TO JONATHAN WILD'S HOUSE. Ogle looked up quickly. \" It's false, Captain \u2014 it's false, I tell you. Tom Bipon is too brave, too true a heart to do any such thing. Do you think, Captain, he would leave you, and me, and Daisy like that ? I won't beUeve it unless I saw him with my own eyes. It is some fiendish tale got up by that villain WUd, to prevent any further in quiries being made about him. I'll go myself, Captain. Stand aside \u2014 do not look so ! I wiU go myseU, and make Jonathan WUd deUver him up.\" FeUx Heron placed his hand kindly but firmly upon Ogle's shoulder, as he said, \" Do you think, Ogle, that anything would have convinced me of the fact, short of beholding him with my own eyes?\" \" Oh, Captain, don't say so \u2014 do not say that you have really seen Tom Bipon !\" \" I have, Ogle. We shaU never look upon his bright young face again in Use, I teU you. Now I must go to Edith.\" Ogle sank into a leathern chair that usuaUy stood in the haU \u2014 his head sank upon his breast, and the strong man's frame shook beneath the painful emotions that were struggling in his breast. Felix Heron and the Earl of Bridgewater walked on for some time in silence after they had left Jonathan Wild's house. It was quite evident to the young Earl of Bridgewater, who was so weU acquainted with aU the devotion and self-sacrifice that had marked Tom Eipon's career from boyhood, to his friend and master, that it was a recoUection of his many sterUng good qualities which now oc cupied the mind of Felix Heron, and caused a look of pain and sorrow to settle upon his coun tenance. \" Come, Whitcombe,\" said the Earl of Bridge water, \"what has happened cannot be helped. Now do not look thus.\" Felix Heron shook his head. \" I cannot help it,\" he repUed. \"I Uttle thought that boy would have come to such an end. I cannot but blame myself now.\" \"Nonsense, Whitcombe! How could you ima gine that Tom Ripon would be so foolhardy as to take to the road, without even consulting you ?\" replied the Earl of Bridgewater. \" Heaven knows it is the last thing I would have countenanced his doing,\" said Heron, mourn fully, \" had he consulted me about it. But it is no use talking now the deed is done, and poor Tom has fallen a victim to circumstances. And now, my kind friend,\" he added, \" I must make what haste I can to Whitcombe House, and in form poor Edith of aU that has happened ; for she was no less anxious than myseU when I left home this morning, determined to see and comfort poor Tom.\" \"Farewell, then, for the present,\" replied Bridgewater. Always remember, Whitcombe, that I am ever at your service.\" FeUx Herom mounted the grand staircase, and in another minute he had clasped Edith to his heart in sUence. Edith raised her head from its resting-place, and gazing up into the face of FeUx, said, in a voice which tried in vain to be cheerful, \" WeU, and how found you that mischief -loving boy ?\" FeUx Heron shook his head, and whispered, in a voice of emotion, \" Alas ! my Edith ! -you. have seen him for the last time.\" Edith started, and no one could have lookej"], [254, "EDrrn heron. 248 upon her expressive countenance without read ing there how much interest, and we may say affection, his many noble qualities and faithful services had implanted in her heart. \" Oh, Felix, Felix !\" she cried, as soon as she had recovered the first shock the inteUigence had given to her \u2014 \" oh, Felix ! are you sure ?\" \" Quite sure, my Edith.

Yea, as the Psalmist says, blessed is he that expecteth nothing.\" \" SUence !\" cried FeUx Heron. \" Assist me to remove Mrs. Eipon into the back parlour!\" While Felix Heron and Mortification were thus employed, they were startled somewhat by an impatient knock on the panel of the shop door for admittance \u2014 for Felix Heron had taken the precaution of replacing the bar of wood across the door when he entered the fence. \" Yea, verily,\" said Mortification, \"I wiU even go and see whether we are visited by a friend or a foe. Eh?\u2014 oh!\" These last words were addressed evidently to the person who had so impatiently demanded admittance. \" By his own hand, my Edith,\" said FeUx Heron, mournfully. \"Alas! alas!\" \" I must leave you now, my dear Edith, for I must go and ascertain more particulars from his mother respecting his capture, and what he had been doing exactly when he was captured by Jonathan Wild ; for as yet I am all in the dark, and know not reaUy whether it may not have been some old grudge of long standing which was the cause of Jonathan WUd taking him pri soner ; and I must say my suspicions point that way, inasmuch as I found him in Wild's house instead of in Newgate.\" \" Go, Felix, go. I need not tell you to return to me as quickly as possible. I am so anxious, and so very, very sad.\" Edith's eyes filled with tears as she said these words, but she quickly restrained them, so as not to add to what she knew were the painful feeUngs of her idolized husband. \"Peace be with you, verily !\" exclaimed Morti fication to the new comer. \" Stuff \u2014 gammon !\" rejoined the visitor. \" None of your hypocrisy with me, Mortification.

His knock was answered by the Reverend Mortification. \"Yea, verily, Captain,\" said Mortification, as he busied himseU in unbarring the door \u2014 \" yea, verily, Captain, thou art welcome, for thou bringest good tidings, as the Psalmist says, to a bereaved mother.\" \" Hold your clack, man !\" interrupted the new comer ; and pushing Mortification aside, he strode hastUy into the parlour, holding in his hand a smaU piece of paper. He paused on the threshold, however, on per ceiving Captain Heron, who, being disguised as Captain Fantome, was, of course, unknown to him. \" Where is Mrs. Eipon ?\" asked FeUx Heron. \" TeU her I wish to see her about Tom in stantly.\" FeUx Heron was the first to speak. \" Your name, sir ? I take it for granted you are a friend?\" \" She is even in the back kitchen, as the Psalmist says, feeding upon sackcloth and Ah!\u2014 oh!\" These exclamations were caused by Mrs. Eipon rushing past Mortification, and giving him such a blow in the side that he reeled against the wall, as she made her way to FeUx Heron, and, seizing his hand, she exclaimed, \" Have you heard anything of my poor boy \u2014 my own Tom ? TeU me \u2014 teU me, Captain, is that vUlain Jonathan WUd going to send him to trial ?\" \" Bather !\" replied the visitor, who was no other than Tom Eipon's quondam friend, Jack Sheppard. \" H your business is not urgent, you had better postpone it for a Uttle time,\" said Felix Heron ; \" for you see Mrs. Eipon is not in a fit state just now to attend to business.\" \" Oh ! oh ! oh !\" groaned Mrs. Eipon. \" Come, Mrs. Eipon !\" said Jack Sheppard, giving her, at the same time, a not very.f>j_tle shake. \" What's the row ?

But whatever he was about to say was quickly brought to a close, by Mrs. Eipon seizing a cup and saucer from the table and throwing it at him, while she almost screamed out, \" Hold your tongue, you coward !

Tell me how you came to see and speak to him ?\" \"Well, that would take more time just now than I feel inclined to waste, as I do not know whether our friend Jonathan Wild may not be on the look-out for me again.

Mortification \u2014 who evidently had a wholesome dread of Mrs. Bipon \u2014 beat a hasty retreat some where in the dfrection of the lower regions, while Mrs. Bipon returned to the back parlour, where she found Jack Sheppard stiU seated on the table, swinging his legs backwards and for wards in a most unconcerned fashion. \" Who may you be ?\" inquired Mortification. \" Open !\" replied the voice. \" I have goods to dispose of, if this is Mrs. Eipon's.\" CHAPTEB CCLXIV. \" Oh, here you are !\" he exclaimed, as Mrs. Eipon entered the apartment. \" A good bargain, \u2014eh?\" UBS.

I had to scramble down again, and after half an hour's hard work, I succeeded in getting an im mense holdfast out of the waU, which, I suppose had done duty as a gaUows many a time for poor wretches who preferred that to Tybum Tree;"], [258, "EDITH HERON. 252 and with that I intended to set to work in good earnest, and make my way into Tom's ceU.\" \" Which you did,\" said Mrs. Eipon, forgetting, in the interest she took in Jack Sheppard's story, his dislike to being interrupted. \" Now, I tell you what it is, Mrs. Eipon,\" he cried ; \" if you put me out again, I'll tell you nothing, but leave you to find out everything for yourseU.\" Mrs. Eipon promised to be more on her guard in future, and Jack Sheppard continued. \"As I was saying, when I possessed myseU of the iron holdfast, I intended to commence opera tions at once, but I was brought to a standstUl by hearing Jonathan Wild's voice just outside my cell-door. I just had time to hide my holdfast when WUd entered, looking uglier than ever.\" \" The wretch !\" said Mrs. Eipon. \" On that point I think we are both pretty well agreed,\" said Jack Sheppard ; \" he is a wretch, and no mistake !\" was content to hang at the end of the two years.\" \" But you didn't mean it, Jack ?.'\u25a0' \" Mean it ! Now reaUy, Mrs. Eipon, here have I been talking aU this time to one I supposed to be a sensible woman, and I find, after all, that you are as green as a dairy-maid that has never left her own viUage. Mean it! \u2014 why of course I didn't mean it ! I don't consider that there is any occasion to keep faith with such a man as Jonathan WUd ; so, you see, it made no difference to me whether I said yes or not.\" \" I see \u2014 I 6ee ! What did Jonathan Wild say?\" \" Oh, he was mightUy pleased, and said a good deal about Tom being a fool for not agreeing to his terms as I had done.\" \" Then Tom would not consent ?\" \" No ; Tom is a good deal too romantic, and has notions of honour which I suppose he has imbibed from Captain Heron.\" Mrs. Bipon made no reply to this remark of Jack Sheppard, as she feared that it might lead to questions she would find it difficult to answer with regard to 38e_sx Heron. After a pause, Mrs. Bipon said, \" I wish I knew what Captain Fantome intends to do with regard to Tom.\" \" What did he want ?\" asked Mrs. Eipon. \" Oh, only to make a Uttle compact with me \u2014 namely, that it I would share with him all my profits for the next two years, that he would un dertake to hold me harmless.\" \" And did you consent ?\" \"Why, how else was I to get out of his clutches? Consent! Of course I consented, but I wanted to speak to Tom first, so I said I wanted a Uttle time to consider.\" \" Captain Fantome ? Who's he ?\" \"Why, that gentleman who was here when you came in.\" \" Oh, I remember now. Is he a friend, then ? He did seem to take a great interest in that bit of a note I brought to you from Tom.\" \" Yes, yes \u2014 a great friend,\" said Mrs. Eipon, with a Uttle confusion. \" I dare say he is going to see what can be done for him.\" \" That was well.\" \" I got rid of Jonathan WUd as quickly as I could, you may be sure ; for I had no wish to pass another night under his roof, U I could possibly help it.\" \" It was very good of you, though, to wait merely for the sake of seeing my poor boy,\" said Mrs. Eipon. \" Not at aU. Tom would have done quite as much for me any day. So, as I was going to say, when you interrupted me, Mrs. Eipon, as soon as Jonathan WUd left my cell, I set to work \" \" WeU, I wish he would come and teU us if he has been able to get Tom out of tbat horrid Little Newgate of his. Upon my word, I think I would rather be in the real prison, for then one might have a chance of getting acquitted ; but when you get into Jonathan Wild's clutches, one never knows how long he may keep you, to revenge himseU upon you for some private grievance of his own.\" \" Aud did you succeed in pushing up the stone, Jack?\" \" To be sure I did. With Tom's assistance we soon got it up sufficient for me to be able to creep into his celL and then it was that Tom gave me that paper, and told me to teU you that it was only his hat and boots that he hung up in his ceU, and that so startled Captain Heron.\" Mrs. Eipon stepped into the shop and looked from the window. \" I don't see any signs of him returning,\" she said; \"but I've no doubt he will find some means of letting me know if anything has been done for Tom.\" Mrs. Eipon gave a cry of joy. \" And now, Mrs. Eipon,\" added Jack Shep pard, \"I've told you all you want to hear, haven't I?\" \" Very likely, Mrs. Bipon ; and now I will just go out a bit, and look about me, for I shall begin to-night my career on the road, the fruits of which Jonathan WUd believes are to be shared with him.

FELIX HERON SEEKS THE ADVICE OF __\u00bb ATTORNEY. Felix Heron was not long in making his friend the young Earl of Bridgewater aware of the state of affairs with regard to Tom Eipon, and to-"], [259, "253 EDITH HEK0H. arrest Tom Eipon for highway robbery! In with him to Newgate \u2014 in with him to Newgate ! Ha, ha ! He is released from Jonathan Wild's house, but only to enter Newgate, where it wUl go hard with him, or my name is not Jonathan WUd! Ha! ha!\" gether they went and obtained an order for his release. Another half-hour saw the two friends again standing before the door of the great thief-taker, and demanding admittance. This time the man on the lock seemed incUned to be rather insolent. Felix Heron and the Earl of Bridgewater knew it would be in vain to resist under the circum stances, and they became the unwilUng witnesses of the capture of Tom by some eight or ten of Jonathan WUd's myrmidons. FeUx Heron was pale as death, but turning to Tom he whispered something in his ear, which seemed to bring him some comfort, for the boy raised his head, and looking defiantly at Jonathan Wild, he said, \" I'm ready, Johnny. I'm sorry you were so disappointed at finding that I would not turn highwayman and take you into partner ship. I could not think of mixing myself up with any but honest men, you see.\" \"Take him away \u2014 take him away!\" roared WUd, now thoroughly beside himseU with rage ; \u2014 \" take him away, I say ! He shall hang \u2014 hang \u2014 hang, as sure as my name's Jonathan WUd!\" It would have been useless attempting to do battle against such amazing odds, and Tom Bipon aUowed himself to be quietly led away by the myrmidons of Jonathan WUd. A few seconds merely sufficed to bring them within the precincts of Newgate ; and, with no very gentle hands, Tom was consigned to one of, perhaps, the gloomiest ceUs in that gloomy build ing. \" Now then, gents, what's your pleasure ?\" \" This,\" said Felix Heron, showing him the order of release for Tom. \" We wish to see Mr. WUd immediately.\" The man looked first at one and then at the other. \"Mr. Wild?\" \" Yes,\" repUed Felix Heron, impatiently. The man opened the door, and showed them into what Jonathan WUd was pleased to caU his office. In a few minutes, Jonathan WUd made his ap pearance. \" I have come, sir,\" said Felix Heron, \" to in sist upon your releasing Tom Bipon, whom you have detained in your custody illegally.\" \"Oh, certainly,\" began Wild: \"I am quite willing to release him upon proper authority.\" \" Then you have that authority,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater, again showing the order of release. Wild smiled hideously, and opening a door, shouted out \" Jenkins ! \" \" Yes, sir !\" repUed a voice. There was a whispered conference outside the door of the room in which Felix Heron and the Earl of Bridgewater were, and then they heard Jonathan WUd say aloud, \" Go and fetch Tom Eipon ; he is released by order of a judge.\" There was a look of anxiety upon the face of Felix Heron during those few minutes which elapsed while the man Jenkins was gone to exe cute the order which had been given him by Jonathan Wild. It was with a heavy heart that poor Tom looked about him when he found himself alone, for the sweet feehng which had pervaded his whole being in fancying himself once more at Uberty, and with the assurance that he had Cap tain Heron's forgiveness for exposing his valued Daisy to so much peril, now rendered the loneli ness of his cell particularly depressing. In about the space of ten minutes footsteps were heard, however, outside the door. Felix Heron moved towards it, and in another second Tom Eipon had faUen on his knees before him, clasping his hands over his face, saying, \" Oh, I did not deserve this !\" \" Hush Tom ! \u2014 hush !\" said Felix Heron. Then, turning to Wild, he said, \" Mr. WUd, you understand that Tom goes with us.\" \" Oh, yes \u2014 he leaves the house,\" said WUd, dryly. \" Come, then \u2014 do not let us waste more valu able time hei\u00a3.\" Tom now took a survey of his prison cell. It was almost a square chamber, Ughted but by a grated window high up in the roof, aud through the iron bars of which the bright sun light had never been known to enter. Tom flung himself down upon a heap of straw that was in one corner of the cell, and began to think over his situation. \"WeU,\" cogitated Tom, \"I'm in for it now, that's certain. Jonathan Wild can hang me U he is so minded, and I know I'm not a favourite of his. Well, it can't be helped, I suppose ; and yet I should like to Uve a Uttle longer, too.\" Felix Heron laid his hand upon Tom's shoulder, and led him towards the door. Tom was young, and to the young death is always appaUing ; but when that death is to be a violent one, no wonder that they should shrink from it. There were six or eight of WUd's men stationed in the passage. \"Open!\" shouted Felix Heron, \"and give us free egress.\" The man exchanged glances with Jonathan Wild. The day foUowing, Friday, Tom Eipon knew he was to be put upon his trial ; and, in his own mind, he had quite determined that his end was close at hand. \u2022 \" Open, I say !\" again shouted Felix Heron. The door was flung open, and the Earl of Bridgewater led the way, foUowed by FeUx Heron and Tom Eipon, the former still keeping his hand upon the shoulder of Tom, as though he feared some treachery even then. They had taken two steps over the threshold when Jonathan Wild ran up, and shouted in his highest accents, \"Bull-dogs, do your duty! I \" WeU,\" he said to himseU, 'as he flung him self once more upon the straw, \"it's no use making one's seU miserable before the time. I'll try and see what a little sleep will do.\" Thus saying, Tom made himseU as comfort able as it was possible to do upon his rough couch, and was soon in a sound sleep. In that dreamless sleep we wUl leave him, whUe we return to FeUx Heron, who, we have"], [260, "254 EDITH HERON. seen, had been 60 bitterly disappointed in his efforts to rescue his faithful young follower from the dilemma in which he had placed himself. Felix Heron, then, after taking leave of his friend, the Earl of Bridgewater, made his way to Whitcombe Honse. \" Are you going to leave me, then ?\" ashed Edith, in a tone of anxiety. \" Only for a short time, whUe I consult a lawyer as to the best way of being of service to Tom. I will return in a very short space of time. So now fareweU, dearest.\" Felix Heron made his way at once to a house in the vicinity of the Temple, to the chambers ol a lawyer at once famed for his acuteness and ec centricity. Ogle was waiting very impatiently, in the hope of seeing his favourite, Tom, return, accom panied by Felix Heron. It was almost ludicrous to observe the look of severity he assumed for the occasion ; but when he saw Captain Heron returning alone, the ex pression on his countenance quickly changed to one of alarm. FeUx Heron was admitted at once to the pre sence of Mr. Dobbs. As he entered the apartment, the old lawyer, without raising his eyes from a sheet of parch ment, which seemed to be engaging all his atten tion, said, in a quick, impatient tone of voice, \" Now, sir ; your business ! My time is valu able.\" \" Alone, Captain ?\" was all Ogle could say. \" Yes, Ogle,\" repUed Felix Heron. \" The boy is now a prisoner in Newgate.\" Ogle looked concerned, but Felix Heron passed him quickly as he mounted the grand staircase, anxious as he was to talk the matter over with Edith. Felix Heron, then, in as few words as pos sible, detailed candidly to the old lawyer the po sition of affairs with regard to Tom Bipon. \" Humph !\" was the only sound that came from the lips of Mr. Dobbs when Felix Heron had finished speaking. Edith was as much concerned as Ogle had been, and, for the moment, could think of nothing that could be done to aid Tom in his present perilous situation. \" I have stated the case to you,\" said Felix Heron, \" without any reservation, and want your opinion.\" \" I am to understand that you wish, if pos sible, to defeat the ends of justice, and to aid and assist this young scamp \" \" What do you intend to do, FeUx ?\" she asked, as she looked up into the thoughtful face of her husband. \" I scarcely know, Edith,\" he repUed. \" That man, Jonathan Wild, can so easily get the boy convicted and condemned, that nothing but a very bold step can possibly save him.\" Edith turned pale, and putting her arm lovingly round the neck of Felix Heron, she said, \" You will not run any more risks, Felix, now that we are on the threshold of quietness and peace ?\" \" Not unnecessarily, my Edith ; but I am quite sure that you would not wish to see me stand idly by while that faithful, though reckless, boy perishes on the scaffold.\" \" I had not thought of that, Felix,\" said Edith. \" No, that must not be ; at any hazard you must make an effort to save him. But what is that effort to be ?\" \"Hold, sir!\" interrupted FeUx Heron. \"I did not come here to have any such comments made. I came here to ask your advice as to the best means of rescuing a youth from the hands of the law, who, beyond indulging in a boyish froUc, has done nothing to make himseU inimical to it\" \" Boy's frolics !\" ejaculated the lawyer. \" Yes,\" added Heron; \" although, doubtless, to legal eyes they assume the magnitude of crimes of importance.\" The lawyer haU closed his eyes, and looked inquiringly at Heron. \" Perhaps, then,\" he said, \"you wUl have no objection to define more particularly what these ' boy's errors' consisted of ?\" Heron found that he was under the close scru tiny of vigilant eyes, and the natural disposition he had to be perfectly frank upon aU subjects in duced him now to make a confidence with this man that he otherwise would have shrunk from, inasmuch as by so doing he was certainly bear ing a kind of evidence against Tom Bipon. But after the pause of a few seconds Heron spoke. \" Emulating,\" he said, \" the example of some of those adventurous men who have gone upon the road, with nothing but a good horse and a bold heart to sustain them, this boy, for he is little more, committed some follies on the high way.\" The lawyer nodded. \" I understand,\" he said, gravely. \" He is charged with highway robbery.\" \" I presume as much, \" replied Heron; \"but I have not the particulars of the charge, and know little further concerning it, except that it will be supported by Jonathan WUd.\" \" An excellent support to any charge. But as a criminal lawyer it is my duty to know the par ticulars of every charge.\" After a moment's pause, Felix Heron spoke again. \" I have been thinking, Edith, that you, too, would like to assist me in saving Tom.\" \" Yes \u2014 oh, yes ! This is kind of you to let me share your danger \u2014 if danger there be.\" \" Nay, dearest,\" repUed Felix, \" I hope there may be no danger \u2014 but of that we will take our chance.\" \" Yes\u2014 oh, yes !\" \" Well, then, I propose that you and I go as witnesses at Tom's trial to-morrow.\" \" As witnesses, Felix ?\" \" Yes ; I will disguise myself as an old colonel ; and you, Edith, must hide these luxu riant tresses,\" continued Felix Herou, as he fondly stroked the glossy curls that fell in such rich masses about \\er lovely face. \" Why, Felix ?\" asked Edith. \" Because, my Edith, you must personate the wife of the aforesaid Colonel Travers, you know.\" \" WilUngly \u2014 most willingly,\" said Edith. \" Then let it be so arranged. Until I return, Edith, you can busy yourseU in making what preparations you think necessary for the new role you have to play.\""], [261, "255 EDITH HERON. Mr. Dobbs scribbled something on a small 6crap of paper, and touched some mysterious bell handle that was in some way connected with his table. CHAPTEB OCLXVL TOM RIPON IS VISITED Dt NEWGATE BT JACK A strange, cadaverous looking creature, who was his clerk, made an instant appearance, and almost as instantly disappeared with the scrap of paper iu his hand. A slight shade of suspicion passed across the mind of Captain Heron as he noticed these mys terious proceedings of the attorney. Was it possible that this man had penetrated his disguise, and knew who he really was? Heron was not a likely man to be frightened at the shadow of a danger, so he sat composedly waiting for what might next occur, but keeping at the same time a watchful glance upon the attorney. SHEPPARD. The lawyer, with something of a covert smile upon his face, aUowed the indignation of Felix Heron to expend itseU before he spoke again. \" Look you, sir,\" he then said : \" your object ie not to vindicate the law, or even to awaken society to a knowledge of Jonathan WUd's de merits. All you wish at present is to save this boy, Tom Eipon?\" \" True \u2014 true ! That is the object. Let us abide by it.\" \" Then what say you to an alibi ?\" \" My own thought ; and I would resort to such a proceeding a thousand times more cheerfully now that I feel the specific charge against which I set it up is a false one.\" \"Good !\" added the lawyer. \"That is what I call meeting craft with craft, and fighting Jonathan WUd with his own weapons. To dispute with him about the charge would be vain ; it is so ex ceedingly simple and so well supported. Not a single word should be said about Mr. Benjamin Mason not being a respectable man, and not being robbed of his gold snuff-box; but the whole defence should confine itself to the allegation that the prisoner at the bar could not possibly have committed the robbery, in consequence of having been at least twenty miles distant on the evening in question, in company of other persons.\" \"Your advice,\" said Heron, \"singularly chimes in with my own idea. I thought of personating a gentleman who has no more real existence than the Mr. Benjamin Mason who will be produced by Jonathan Wild. I thought of appearing in this boy's favour, and caUing myself Colonel Travers.\" \"An excellent name. But we should require two witnesses for the alibi.\" The cadaverous-looking clerk returned in about five minutes, aud laid before his master a short memorandum. \" Here,\" said Mr. Dobbs, \" are the particulars of the charge. Thomas Eipon, accused of stealing a gold snuff-box of Mr. Benjamin Mason, in the Oxford Boad, in the evening of the fourth of September. Which charge is to he supported by the testimony of Mr. Mason himself, who wiU re cognise the culprit ; and by the further evi dence of Jonathan Wild, who wiU produce the gold snuff-box, which he found upon the pri soner.\" The lawyer looked up in the face of Felix Heron with a smile, as he read this memoran dum. \" I would wager my Use,\" cried Heron, \" the charge is false.\" \"Of that there really cannot be the smallest doubt !\" \" You think so ?\" \" I know it It has all the charming simplicity of one of Mr. WUd's cases, and a conviction is almost certain.\" \"But \" \" My wife !\" \" Ah ! better stfll. A lady witness in such a case does wondera ; and I think, sir, under these cir cumstances, I can promise you an acquittal of the boy. But Jonathan Wild wUl be furious, and as soon as he can be removed from Newgate he should be conveyed at once to a place of safety and secrecy. And now, sir, U you wUl come to me with the lady to-morrow morning at an early hour, we wUl go into the minute particulars of the defence, and counsel shaU be instructed ac cordingly.\" FeUx Heron's hopes ran high of now being able to rescue his faithful and attached foUower from the extreme peril which beset him. \" Hear me out, Capfain Fantome. I have no doubt whatever but that there is no such person as Mr. Benjamin Mason, and I dare say the gold snuff-box that Jonathan Wild wiU produce is one that has done duty under simUar circumstances often before.\" \"This is monstrous, and surely only needs to be exposed in court, not only to ensure the immediate acquittal of the poor boy, but the utter confusion and destruction of Jonathan Wild.\" \"Not so fast, Captain \u2014 not so fast. AU these little desirable events are by no means so likely to follow as you suppose. We must meet craft with craft. Jonathan Wild has the ear of the court, and no one would be Ustened to for a moment who should charge him with perjury and subornation of evidence. We must meet craft by craft ; and perhaps borrowing an idea from even Wild himseU, we may, by fighting him with his own weapons, defeat him.\" Heron rose, and paced the lawyer's room in ex citement The means by which this safety was to be ac compUshed were certainly not those which he would have chosen had much variety of action been open to him. Notwithstanding, however, aU its perils, neither Heron nor Edith would permit themselves to shrink for a moment from the mode that presented itseU of saving Tom. And whUe these anxious exertions were being made for his safety, Tom's position in the miser able ceU of Newgate was anything but a pleasant one. \" To what a depth of infamy,\" he exclaimed, \" has the criminal jurisprudence of this country sunk, when such a man as Jonathan Wild holds human Uves at his disposal in this terrible fashion !\" The cell to which Tom was consigned had evidently not been tenanted by any human being"], [262, "256 EDITH HERON. \" Yes \u2014 yes ?\" said Tom. \"Well, as I was saying, as soon as ever I mentioned your name, this Captain\u2014\u2014 what do you caU him ?\" \" Fantome \u2014 Captain Fantome.\" \" Well, this Captain Fantome picked up the letter which your mother had let fall, and before we could prevent it, and without saying ' With your leave,' he read it off, and was out of the house Uke a shot. I hope, Tom, it's aU right \u2014 eh?\" for a long space of time, for the rats and other vermin had evidently long considered it as part and parcel of their own particular domain. The stones of which the flooring was com posed were damp and sUppery, and the heap of straw which lay in one corner had turned almost black. Tom sighed deeply as he looked around him, and compared in his own mind his present quarters with those he had lately been in the habit of con sidering his own at Whitcombe House. The allowance of bread and water whioi; had been brought to him by his surly and brutal gaoler were still untasted by him, but the rats, who scarcely seemed to notice him, were not so fastidious. \" Oh, yes,\" said Tom, \" I'm glad he read it You don't think, Jack, he seemed very angry with me ?\" \"No. I should say not,\" repUed Jack; \"but what does it matter whether he is angry or not ? Now, U it had been Captain Heron \" \" Don't talk about him, Jack,\" said Tom ; \" if he knew what a simpleton I had been, I am sure he would never forgive me !\" \" Nonsense, Tom ! Why, Captain Heron would only say that you had foUowed his example ; and you couldn't have a better, you know !\" Tom sighed. He could not hide from himself the fact that he had given Felix Heron great cause to be very much displeased with him ; and that thought, more than anything else, it was that weighed upon his spirits. He now gladly turned the con versation by asking Jack Sheppard how it was he had obtained admission to his ceU. Tom began to dread the approach of night, for (here was something truly appaUing in the thought that darkness would now soon be added to his other discomforts. He rose and paced his cell, for it was impossible for him to sit any longer; and Tom thought, too, that in aU probabUity the rats might be scared away if he were not so stiU and quiet as he had been. He had paced to and fro the narrow confines of his prison-house perhaps some twenty or thirty times, when he was roused from his unenviable reflections by hearing approaching footsteps. At that moment, even the presence of Jona than WUd himseU would have been haUed by Tom with a feeUng almost akin to pleasure. The footsteps approached nearer. Then they paused outside the door of the ceU. There was a rattUng of keys, and then one was thrust noisUy into the keyhole of Tom's ceU, and two persons were visible. One was the gaoler ; the other was Jack Shep pard. \" Ah, that's the question you should have asked before, Tom !\" repUed his friend. \" I am sent here by Jonathan WUd !\" \"By Jonathan Wild?\" \" By Jonathan WUd !\" added Jack Sheppard. Tom looked inquiringly into the face of Jack Sheppard. \" Yes, Tom,\" he added, \" Jonathan WUd is stUl willing to take you into partnership, U you wUl accept his terms.\" \" What, give him haU my profits on the road for two years, and then consent to be hanged at Tyburn ? Never !\" \" WeU,\" said Jack, \" if I did not think it rather a fooUsh resolve, I should say it was brave ; but why don't you accept his terms, Tom? You needn't consider yourseU bound to keep your promise to such a man as Jonathan WUd, you know !\" Tom almost screamed with joy as he beheld the face of his friend, and, grasping his hand, he cried, \" This is kind, indeed, Jack !\" \"Hold hard!\" replied Jack Sheppard. \"Do you think you've got hold of a pump handle ? Don't wring my arm off !\" Tom's habitual joyousness returned instantly that he found the gaoler had left them alone to gether. \" Have you seen the Captain ? \u2014 Captain Fan tome, I mean,\" was the first question that burst from Tom's lips. Tom had his own thoughts upon this subject, and his ideas of honour and truthfulness, which in all probability he had imbibed from bis much loved master, never forsook him. \" I couldn't do it, Jack ; don't ask me ! I know Jonathan Wild wiU hang me ; he may as well do so at once, instead of waiting for two years.\" As Tom said this, Jack Sheppard could not but be struck with the dejection so unwonted which was depicted in Tom's face. \"Come, cheer up, old fellow!\" he said, bring ing his hand down heavily upon Tom's shoulder ; \" never say die ! There is hope yet ; and if you think I care so much for Johnny WUd as to leave you here, when I may possibly get you out, you mistake Jack Sheppard !\" Tom shook his head. \" Well, I can't say I haven't seen him,\" repUed Jack Sheppard ; \" but that's about aU I can say ; for as soon as he read your bit of a letter to your mother \" \"Did he see it, then?\" \" Why, yes ; there was no help for it. He happened to be at the old crib in Wardour Street when I got there, and seemed to be the only person capable of using their wits at that mo ment.\" \" What did he say ?\" asked Tom, who was much more interested than Jack Sheppard had any idea of. \" Oh, you must know your mother, or the old gal, as you call her, was in a great taking about yoa, and was not able to read a word of your letter; but in order to rouse her I just said, ' Don't go on so, Mrs. Eipon, about Tom being dead ; ho's alive and kicking, and has sent you that note to let you know all was right' \" \" Your will, Jack, may be good to get me oat, but it's easier said than done !\" \" Perhaps.\""], [263, "EDITH HEECN. 257 There was a look of excitement and expecta tion about the eyes of Jack Sheppard. and Tom now regarded his proceedings with not a Uttle surprise. Jack began deUberately to undress, singing, as he did so, a popular ditty, which was said to have been composed by himseU. \" Now, Tom,\" he cried, \" what's to hinder you from changing about a little ? You've tried the road as a highwayman, and perhaps the grabs have begun to know you a little in that character.

Now, Tom, dress yourseU in my togs, and as Jack Sheppard you may pass out of Newgate, whUe I take a little rest here.\" Tom made a dart at Jack's clothes ; and then, as quickly again dropping them to the floor of the cell, he turned and spoke to Sheppard with emotion. \"And what's to become of you if I do this thing?\" \" Become of me ?\" \" Yes, Jack ; why should I leave you here to pay, perhaps, the penalty of my acts ?\" \"No such thing, Tom.

Now all you've got to do, as you pass through the hall of Newgate, is to put your hands in your pockets and whistle. I suppose you can do that?\" Tom whistled louder than ever. \"Well, you're an odd fellow,\" said the turn key. \" There's no getting a word out of you \u2014 good, bad, or indifferent. But here's the end of my beat. Jarvis is on the lock.\" Tom was an adept at whistling. It was just the sort of useless accomplishment he was sure to pick up to perfection, and the vaulted passages of Newgate echoed to the clear tones which he produced. The vestibule of the prison was reached. A couple of tunkeys were loUing haU asleep upon the wooden benches which were placed there for their accommodation. \"Bather,\" said Tom, with a smUe. \" Then let it be the tune I was singing just now, and the chances are twenty to one not a word will be said to you.\" \" But if one of the warders should speak ?\" \" Don't answer, Tom.\" \"Not answer?\" The \" man on the lock,\" as he was teehnicaUy caUed, sat upon a high stooL dangUng his legs to and fro in such close proximity to the wicket, that he had nothing to do but to stretch out hiB hand to turn the key in the lock. Tom, according to tbe instructions given him by Jack Sheppard, thrust his hands deep into the skirt pockets of his coat, and imitating exceed ingly well the somewhat swaggering gait of Jack, he crossed the vestibule. \" Oh, you're off, are you ?\" said the man o. the lock. \" No, IVe arranged all that\" \" How could you arrange it ?\" Jack langhed. \" Look you here, Tom ! IVe been in and out of Newgate half a dozen times to-day, just on purpose to see how this little job could be carried out. Some one or other of the fellows on the lock, ot about the prison, has always had some thing to say to me, but I didn't answer them, and only went on whistling all the same. They know very weU it's aU right between me and Jonathan, and that some fine day he will tell them I'm to be grabbed the next time I cross the threshold of Newgate, but that wont be yet awhile ; and so, you see, all you've got to do is to keep on whistUng.\" \" That's easy.\" \" It is ; so now be off with yoa at once !\" Tom held out his hand. Tom whistled more loudly and clearly thai. before. The two turnkeys who were haU asleep looked up drowsily. \" What sort of game's that,\" growled one, \" to keep on whistling in that sort of way Uke a blackbird, instead of making yourself agreeable, eh?\" Tom gave a slight kick at the wicket gate, as an intimation to Jarvis that he wished to be let out \" Oh, be off with you ; you stun a fellow with all that whistling !\" The highly polished key waa turned in th _ lock. \" Jack, when I forget all you've done for me, I shall at the same time forget that my name's Tom Eipon.\" They shook hands heartily. \"Now be off with you!\" added Jack. \"I shaU consider that in fire minutes yon an clear of the old 6tone Jug.\" \" I hope so.\" Jack Sheppard, as he uttered the last words, rapped at the door of the ceU to be let out. The heavy tread of the turnkey in the stone paved passage beyond was immediately heard. \"All's right !\" cried Sheppard. The door of the ceU was flung open, and Tom walked out. The little wicket opened noiseless! y on its weU oUed binges. Tom considered himseU free. He ceased the whistling, and made a spring to clear the steps at a bound, and get outside of the atmosphere of Newgate. An exclamation of wrath and fright came from some one at the moment, and Tom found that instead of leaping right on to the pavement ol the Old BaUey, he had encountered some one who was just ascending the steps, and who, reeUng with the shock of the collision, very nearly fell backwards. \" Out of the way,\" cried Tom, \" or it wfll be worse for you ?\" \" Not so fast, my young spark !\" cried the stranger. \" Hilloa, there ! Break gaol \u2014 break gaol ! Are you all drunk or asleep in Newgate to-night?\" Tom knew the voice now. He began to whistle. The turnkey was ra'__ffl loquacious, and wished evidently to talk to the supposed Jack Sheppard. \" WeU, Jack,\" he said, \" I suppose you've squared everything with Mr WUd, for I hear you're to come in and out of Newgate as often as you Uke?\" Tom only whistled. \" I suppose,\" added the turnkey, \" that's an old pal of yours yonder?\" Tom still whistled. His heart fafled him for a moment, and he lost strength. Who but Jonathan Wild could utter those tones ? The plan of escape had fasled at the moment, apparently, of its success. Before Tom could recover from the shock of the surprise that WUd's most unexpected pre sence had given him, the active and powerful thief-taker flung his arms round him, and fairly carried him back into the vestibule of the prison. \" He's booked for a dance upon nothing, for I've heard Mr. WUd speaking of him to the Governor ; and he said as he was a young cock that was done crowing, which means, I take it, hat next Monday is to be the end of him.\""], [265, "259 EDITH HERON. cases. You've nabbed me again, so now be satis fied.\" CHAPTEE CCLXVII. \" But I can't.\" \" Nonsense ! You want to be called Jonathan WUd the Great; don'tmake yourself out Jonathan Wild the Little, nor think the worse of a fellow Uke Jack Sheppard, because he tried to help a friend at a pinch.\" \"Bah! Bo!\" TOM RIPON ESCAPES FROM NEWGATE, BUT IS RE- CAPTURED BY JONATHAN WILD. \" Just in time, it seems !\" shouted WUd, as he flung Tom from him, evidently with the intention of doing him some physical injury upon the stone floor of the haU of Newgate. But Tom was rapidly recovering his self-pos session. \"He won't be the worse bargain for you, Jonathan, for the time you have him on that account.\" Slipping to WUd's feet, he seized him by the ankle, and before Jonathan could teU what he was about, he fell backwards, striking his head against the projecting key in the wicket with a force that would have fractured anybody else's skull. WUd reflected. It was evident that the words of Tom had some effect upon him. \" Idiots !\" he cried, as he turned towards ti* officers ; \" idiots ! Take Bipon back to his cell, where I fancy you wiU find Jack Sheppard, and who you wiU take by the collar, and kick out ot Newgate. Look to it. You know your duty now, and I leave you to perform it.\" Wild left the vestibule of Newgate by the door that led towards the Governor's house, and which he opened with the master-key he had possession of. The turnkeys and warders had no resource, whatever might have been their private feehngs upon the occasion, but to carry out WUd's in structions. But Jonathan Wild's cranium was peculiarly constructed ; and although he looked a Uttle con fused for a few seconds, no further mischief seemed to be done. And WUd was so accustomed to these little episodes in his professional existence, that they had ceased to affect him much. His anger was much more directed against the turnkeys than against Tom. The volley of abuse he leveUed at their heads transcends aU description. But it Wild's head was of suoh a construction that it resisted external impressions, the feeUngs of the turnkeys in the vestibule of Newgate seemed to partake of the same character. The abuse and imprecations of Jonathan WUd had not the least effect upon them. They took a hint from Jack Sheppard and Tom Eipon, and after WUd had gone on for some few minutes, they aU took to whistling, in which Tom joined. \" Silence !\" roared WUd. Tom Eipon was conveyed back to his cell, and Jack Sheppard, without being permitted to ex change more than a few words with him, was hustled out of Newgate. \" That's over I\" said Tom, as he flung himself on the straw that did duty for a bed in that miserable cell; \" that's over; and I don't suppose I shall Uve long enough to be able to do so much for Jack Sheppard as he has tried to do for me to-night I wonder how a feUow feels after he's hung. Queer, I suppose ; but I don't see that that should hinder him going to sleep the night before \u2014 no, it isn't exactly the night before, for this is Thursday, and Monday's hanging morning. Oh, it I was but on Hounslow Heath now \u2014 or on the Western Boad with Daisy ; and the moon blink ing in and out among the clouds, and the cooL pleasant air coming over the fields and hay-ricks ! It won't do to think of such things : it won't do \u2014 it won't do \u2014 it won't do ! Good night !\" The whole party only whistled the more intensely. \"I'll have you all hung this session or the next!\" The whole ceased. This was no idle threat on the part of a man like Jonathan Wild \"Well, Mr. Wild,\" said one, \"we couldn't help it\" \" Not help it, three lazy scoundrels that you are, to let a prisoner walk out of Newgate ! And you, Jarvis, too \u2014 you on the lock, you that pretend to be a smart man !\" \"Bless you, Mr. Wild, I knew him all the whUe,\" said Jarvis. \" I only meant to let him get haU down the steps, and then I could have nabbed him again as safe as bricks.\" \"Bah!\" cried Wild; \"tell that to some fool like yourself. Take Eipon back to bis cell again. Stop \u2014 let me look at him. Oh ! I see how it is now ; it's that rascal Sheppard. I'U have them both hung now. Let me see \u2014 let me see !\" WUd took out his pocket-book. \" Ah, yes, to be sure \u2014 yes !

It is true that Jack was helping me to escape, and he is not the fellow to deny it, but all's fair in these Tom fell fast asleep. The Friday morning came, with aU its bustle of criminal trials at the Old Bailey. The criminal jurisprudence of the country was carried on at that period in a strange slip-shod fashion. Many a highwayman or housebreaker was brought into court without any definite idea as to which of his numerous offences against the laws was to be the special one taken cognisance of on that occasion by justice. Tom Bipon was very much in this predica ment That WUd intended to accuse him of highway robbbery of course he knew ; but as regarded the special act laid to his charge, he was as much a spectator and curious listener as any one in court It is difficult to say if the judges and digni taries of the law were aware of the system pur - sued by Jonathan WUd. H they were, it was a great disgrace and"], [266, "260 EDITH HERON. \" Oh, thank you !\" said Tom; \"I dare say it's aU right.\" The counsel for the prosecution rose, and, in a hasty manner, stated the case. He was one of those small junior counsel, who get cases of no real importance, and treat them With indifference. Human lUe was cheap in his estimation ; and perhaps, bad the question been fairly put to him, he would almost have gone the length of saying that it would be just as weU, and save a deal of trouble, to bring in the prisoner at the bar guUty upon no evidence at aU. As it was, however, be was compeUed to state a case, and he did so in the briefest possible fashion. scandal to justice ; although, perhaps, as regarded the real right or wrong of the matter, no great harm was done; that is to say, if we assume that human lUe is to be taken for crimes against property \u2014 a fact which we are very far from assuming, and which is rapidly being considered as one of the barbarisms of a past age. The system was just this. A notorious highwayman or a notorious burglar was apprehended. A great deal of trouble would have been in- volved in actually proving some particular case against him, where he had been the malefactor. Jonathan WUd then got up a sham case, which answered aU the purpose, and saved the time of the court and the jury. The man was hanged for something he had never done at aU. \" My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, \u2014 \" The prisoner at the bar, answering to the name of Thomas Eipon, stands accused ot the heinous crime of highway robbery. \"The lives and properties of his Majesty's subjects cannot be left to the mercy of depreda tors of this description ; and consequently, my lord, and gentlemen of the jury, we are aU much indebted to the vigUant officer who has arrested this young criminal in his nefarious career. \" This specific charge consists in the fact that, on the fourth of September last past, the prisoner at the bar, on the Westeru Boad, between the hours of haU-past nine and haU-past ten, assailed, and put in bodUy fear, a Mr. Benjamin Mason. \" Threatening him with death, and presenting fire-arms at his head in the shape of loaded pistols, he succeeded in taking from that person one gold snuff-box. \" My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, the case is so clear, that I need not trouble you with any further observations ; but being convinced that you wiU vindicate the majesty of the law, I pro ceed at once to caU my witnesses.\" The counsel sat down. But then he had reaUy done a hundred things of the same character, and the practical injustice was considered as nothing. Tom's trial excited no public attention, and at about half-past eleven o'clock in the day ho found himself thrust forward into the dock, to answer for his lUe. In a rapid, indistinct, rambUng kind of way, a short indictment was read against him. It charged him that, in contravention of the peace of our Sovereign Lord the King, he did, hy force of arms on a pubUc highway, put in bodfly fear a certain Benjamin Mason, and took from him certain properties ; viz., a gold snuff box, value nine pounds ten shUlings ; and one ounce of snuff, value two pence one farthing. It was only here and there that Tom caught a word or two of this indictment, and it seemed to him that he was practicaUy charged with steahng a pinch of snuff. The judge put on a severe look. \"Prisoner at the bar,\" drawled the clerk of the arraigns, \"do you plead guUty or not guilty.\" \" Not guilty,\" said Tom, \" though I hardly know what it's very weU about.\" \" Silence !\" \" Benjamin Mason !\" roared the crier of the court. A rather shabbUy-attired individual stepped into the witness-box. \"SUence yourseU!\" said Tom : \"you bring a f eUow here about a pinch of snuff, and then won't let him speak.\" \" SUence !\" \" Swear Benjamin Mason.\" The oath was duly administered, and Benja min Mason took it with an ostentatious kind of fervour, kissing the book with a loud smack, as U he would have caUed the attention of every body in court to the fact that there could be no mistake about bis being duly sworn. \"Now, sir,\" said the counsel. \"Your name is Benjamin Mason ?\" \" It is.\" \" Perhaps I ought to snea__,\" added Tom. There was a laugh in court The judge shook his wig, and looked hard and stern at Tom. \" This dreadful levity,\" he said, \" is Ul-timed, and is calculated to convey an impression to the minds of the court and the jury very detrimental to the prisoner at the bar.\" \"You are a commercial traveUer, I behove?\" \" Yes, sir.\" \" Your late uncle, Mr. Aminadab Mason, pre sented you with a gold snuff-box ?\" \" He did, sir.\" \" Please relate to his lordship and the gentle men of the jury what has become of it\" Mr. Mason, after a slight cough, told bis story. \" Thank you,\" said Tom ; \"let's hear aU about it ; but I may as weU say, to begin with, that I never took a snuff-box from Mr. Benjamin any body ; and as for an ounce of snuff \"Silence!\" \"Prisoner at the bar,\" said the judge, \"you will have an opportunity, either by yourself or through your counsel, of addressing the court. Until then, you must preserve silence.\" One of the counsel who sat just below the judge in the inner bar rose now, and said very quietly, \" I appear for the prisoner, and particu larly request that he should leave the case entirely in my hands, as his counsel.\" \" I was riding down the Western Boad, about a mUe and a half beyond Tyburn Gate, on the evening of the fourth of September last past, when there suddenly came, out of a shady lane, a person on horseback. \" Did he speak to you ?\" \"Yes, sir. He cried out, 'A sine night 1' and"], [267, "261 EDITH HERON. then riding up close to me, he clapped the muzzle of a pistol right into my ear, and shouted, ' Your money or your Use ?' \" \" What did you do then ?\" \" I told him I had no more money than would just pay my turnpikes to Wycombe, but that I had a gold snuff-box, which I hoped he would take, and not do me any injury.\" \" What happened then ?\" \" He took the snuff-box, and, after using some very bad language, rode away.\" \" Was this the snuff-box ?\" Jonathan made no answer, but just looked the advocate in the face. \"What do you know of this affair, Mr. WUd?\" \" Simply this. I heard that several highway robberies had taken place on the Western Boad, and therefore considered it my duty to investi gate the matter. For every night of a whole week I patroled the road, and after much trouble at last I apprehended the prisoner at the bar. ' And what did you find upon him ?\" '\u25a0 A gold snuff-box.\" \" Was this the box ?\" From the solicitor's table, the gold snuff-box that Jonathan WUd had carefully provided to do duty on the occasion was handed up to the witness. Wild pretended to look at the box almost as attentively as Mr. Mason ; and then he replied, sharply and shortly, \" Yes ; this is the box.\" Mr. Benjamin Mason pretended to look at it for a few minutes with great attention. \" Can you swear to that snuff-box as being the one you were robbed of on the occasion in question ?\" \" I can.\" \" How do you know it ?\" . \" I made a private mark on it.\" \" Look at the prisoner at the bar.\" Wild turned, and stared at Tom Bipon. \" Is that the person from whom you took the box ?\" \"By what mark?\" \" A slight injury to one of the hinges.\" \" Very good, Mr. Mason. Now look at the prisoner at the bar, and tell bis lordship and the gentlemen of the jury if that is the person who robbed you.\" Mr. Benjamin Mason turned, and took a long look at Tom Eipon, as U that were the first mo ment he had ascertained that such a person was in court. \" It is.\" \" Then, my lord, and gentlemen of the jury, that is the case ; and I think it is one that will tax all the ingenuity of my learned friend for the defence to answer it.\" Down sat the counsel. \" I suppose there is no defence ?\" said the judge. \" The case seems to. me to be remark ably clear.\" \" Yes, my lord,\" said the counsel that Felix Heron had retained in Tom's favour, \" there is a defence. Clear as the case appears, we have nothing to say to this real or pretended robbery of a gold snuff-box from a Mr. Benjamin Mason ; we have nothing to say to the zeal and energy, real or assumed, of Mr. Jonathan Wild. \" No, my lord, and gentlemen of the jury, aU these matters do not concern us in the least in asmuch as one grand mistake has been com mitted throughout the entire affair. \" The prosecution has got hold of the wrong person.\" \" Oh, an alibi ?\" said the judge. \" Exactly, my lord. I am in a condition to prove, upon incontestable evidence, that the pri soner at the bar could not have been on the Western Boad on the evening in question, seeing that he was in the company of credible witnesses for the whole of that period, at a place caUed Annerley HaU, near Epping Forest. \" The prosecution has made a mistake, and Mr. Jonathan Wild wUl have again to patrol the Western Boad in order to effect the apprehension of the real robber of Mr. Benjamin Mason's gold snuff-box.\" \" Yes ! \" he then exclaimed, with an air of great confidence. \" I can swear to him. That was the person.\" \" You have no doubt about it ?\" \" Not the least\" \" Then I don't think I need trouble you any further, Mr. Mason ; but perhaps my learned friend for the defence may have something to say to you.\" \"Nothing whatever,\" repUed the counsel who was retained in Tom Bipon's favour. From that moment the prosecution knew perfectly weU what the defence of Tom Eipon was to be. An alibi. But they had no possible means of confuting it, or in any way providing against it. It was the only practical means of saving Tom Bipon, inasmuch as it took the entire question out of the hands of the prosecution, and raised a new issue of defence, which had nothing whatever to do with the mock evidence of the mock robbery. \" CaU Jonathan Wild.\" Wild stepped into the witness-box. It was not often that the great thief-taker condescended to become a witness himseU on any of those Uttle occasions when he thought proper to send some one to the gaUows ; but in regard to Tom Eipon, he was angry and re vengeful. He would therefore trust to no subordinate the important and conclusive evidence he intended to give. Wild was duly sworn ; but he was too old a stager at that sort of thing to over-act his part as Benjamin Mason had done. \" Now, Mr. Wild,\" said the counsel, \" attend to me, if you please.\" The counsel sat down. \" CaU Colonel Travers.\" \" Colonel Travers !\" shouted the crier of the court. Admirably got up as an elderly gentleman, with a stoop in his gait and partially supporting himseU on a large gold-headed walking-cane, Felix Heron entered the court He and Edith had remained in a carriage at the door of the Old BaUey untU one of the clerks of the elderly lawyer they had previously em ployed in Tom's favour warned them that the period of action had arrived."], [268, "EDITH HERON. 262 The gUtter of that snuff-box \u2014 worth at least a thousand pounds, as it was \u2014 had a great effect upon the minds of the jury. How could anybody be otherwise than highly respectable in open possession of such a costly article ? \" Now, Colonel Travers, if you please,\" added the counsel, \" wUl you tell us where you were on the 5th of September last past?\" \"From the 3rd of September,\" said Heron, quietly, \" to the 5th, I was at Annerley HaU, near Epping Forest ; and the prisoner at the bar, my servant, was with me.\" This seemed conclusive. CHAPTEB OCLXVIII. FELIX HERON'S PLANS ARE DEFEATED, AUD TOM BIPON IS CONVICTED. The appearance of Felix Heron was so thoroughly gentlemanly and respectable, that every one in the court felt how important a wit ness such a personage must be for the defence. The counsel for the prosecution looked at the disguised Felix Heron with great interest. But of all persons there present on that occa sion, none regarded this witness for the defence with more intense interest and curiosity than Jonathan WUd. The judge looked at the jury, and the jury looked at the judge. The counsel for the prosecution rose, and in a voice of mortification spoke : \u2014 \" Eeally, my lord, and gentlemen of the jury, this man is a perfect stranger to us. It is aU very well for a Colonel Travers to come forward and vouch for the prisoner at the bar ; but who wiU vouch for Colonel Travers ?\" WeU he knew that the whole of the proceed ings were but a solemn farce. Whether or not they were to end in a tragedy, so far as Tom Bipon was concerned, remained to be seen. Felix Heron was perfectly composed and calm. He had made up bis mind that that was the only course to pursue in order to defeat the ma chinations of Jonathan Wild ; and having once so determined, he was not the man to shrink from carrying out the affair to its utmost point. Whether the counsel for the defence actually knew, or only suspected, that this alibi which was about to be proved was only set up as a justifiable kind of defence against Jonathan WUd, just as a man might seize any weapon that came to hand to word off a dastardly attack, it is hard to say. \" Hear, hear !\" shouted WUd. \" Who is that ?\" cried the judge, angrily. Wild saw he had committed himself. \" Bring that person before me who interrupted the court,\" added the judge, \" and I will send him to prison.\" WUd felt his danger, but got out of it with his usual audacity. He immediately pounced upon an unoffending bystander, and dragged him forward. \" Here, my lord, is the man.\" \" How dared you, sir, interrupt the oourt by such unseemly cries ?\" \" Indeed, my lord, I said nothing !\" \" Lock him up. It was hardly to be expected that he would admit his offence.\" Certainly, however, he acted as though every thing was straightforward, and bcth the charge and the defence were to be treated in the most serious manner. Amid a most profound sUence in the court \u2014 for the trial was now becoming interesting \u2014 the examination of FeUx Heron commenced \" Away with him !\" said WUd ; and he flung the man into the arms of a couple of his own myrmidons. \" Your name is Travers, sir?\" \" It is.\" \"If,\" said FeUx Heron, \"it be necessary to produce any further testimony on this point, my carriage is at the door, and Lady Travers will only be too happy to add her testimony to mine on this occasion.\" \" You hold the rank of a colonel in the army ?\" \" I hold rank, and I am called Colonel Travers.\" \" Will you be so good as to look at the pri soner at the bar ?\" Jonathan Wild immediately left the court He wanted to see who the Lady Travers was, and what sort of equipage was at the door of the court FeUx Heron turned slowly, and looked at Tom Eipon. Was he recoguised ? Yes. He was completely baffled by the disguise of Felix Heron ; and although he knew perfectly well that the whole affair was some trick in order to procure the acquittal and Uberation of Tom Eipon, he was quite at a loss how to meet it or combat with it. Tom stretched out his arms towards him. \"Master! master!\" he cried. Tom spoke involuntarily; but it he had been tutored for twelve months, he could not possibly have said anything more to the purpose than that. Chance befriended Jonathan WUd in a manner he little expected. \" Certainly,\" said Heron, as though in antici pation of the question that was about to be asked him. \" I look at the prisoner at the bar, and I know him perfectly weU.\" \" Who is he, sir ?\" \" His name is Jacob Gray, and he ia my servant.\" Almost the first person he saw at the door of the court, waiting among the crowd, was the Eev. Mortification Bipon. Mrs. Bipon was at an eating-house in the Old Bailey, in a state of mortal trepidation and rum punch, on Tom's account. Mortification had been craning his long neck and body over the heads of the people to hear what was going on, when Jonathan Wild sud denly gave him a blow in the stomach, which nearly doubled him in two. \" Murder \u2014 yea, murder 1 As the Psalmsit re- \" Jacob Gray !\" exclaimed Tom. \" Jacob Gray !\" echoed Jonathan WUd. \" Yes,\" said Heron, calmly. Taking a diamond-mounted snuff-box from hia pocket, Heron quietly took _ pinch of ita contents."], [269, "263 EDITH HEBON. Heron took two steps towards the door of the marks, ' We are here to-day, and doubled up like foot-rules to morrow.' Murder ! murder !\" court. \" Hold !\" cried WUd. \" H the prisoner at the bar he indeed Thomas Bipon, then this Colonel Travers is an impostor and a false witness.\" \" Not so false a witness, by a thousand-fold,\" cried Heron, \"as the arch-vUlain, Jonathan WUd !\" Jonathan had stretched out his hand to lay hold of Heron, but the latter, with one weU directed blow, that perfectly astonished and para lyzed the bystanders, coming as it did from what appeared to be so elderly a man, laid Jonathan prostrate and insensible on the floor of the court \" SUence?\" said Wild, \" and listen to me.\" \" Gracious, it's Mr. Jonathan ! A vaunt ! Get thee behind me, WUd! Avaunt! thou Jona than \" \" Peace, idiot, and listen to me ! Step this way!\" Wild seized Mortification by the collar, and dragged him into a remote corner. \" Yea, I am even as a lamb in the hands of the spoiler.\" \" Silence ! You come here to look after Tom Eipon?\" \" I admit it ; I am not aware that that is an offence in law.\" \" Certainly not ; and as for me, I repent.\" Mortification coughed. \" Yea, he repenteth, and some extra wicked cess is on hand.\" \" Idiot, what do you mean ? But it matters not There is no time to lose. Tom is in great danger : he is believed to be somebody else, who has committed no end of crimes ; and the testi mony of some witness is wanted who wUl con vince the judge and the jury that his name is reaUy Tom Bipon.\" \" Yea, I can do that.\" \"Of course you can. Come on. You wiU earn his everlasting gratitude and the gushing devotion of his mother. Ha, ha !\" Everybody made way instinctively from be fore a man whose arm seemed to be like a sledge hammer. In haU a minute Heron was out of the court, and jumping into the carriage at its door, he and Edith were driven away by Ogle, who was on the coach-box, before any one had sufficiently re covered from the surprise of the action to note even which way they went. Tom was convicted. The trial was over in another quarter of an hour, and the bewUdered Mortification found himself in the Old BaUey, with some vague con viction on his mind that he had done a deal cf mischief, although what it exactly consisted in he had no possible idea. Jonathan WUd gave Mortification another blow in the stomach, and then one on the back, so that the unfortunate reverend father-in-law of Tom hardly knew it he were on his head or his heels as he was hustled into court by Jona than WUd. CHAPTEB CCLXIX. JONATHAN WILD MAXES A HASTY EXIT FROM \"Another witness in the case, my lord,\" cried WUd. CASTLENEAU HOUSE. Br a circuitous route, Felix Heron, with Edith, reached \u2014 not Whitcombe House \u2014 but the resi dence of Lady Castleneau. The counsel for the prosecution took the hint at once, and became exceedingly anxious to ex amine a witness introduced by Jonathan, whose animus against the prisoner was but too apparent and weU known. Owing to the unfortunate interposition of Mortification Eipon, the attempt to save Tom from the terrible fate that seemed now to await him had failed. FeUx Heron looked with a disturbed air at the Bev. Mortification, and knew not how to warn him that he might by some indiscreet words do a world of mischief. FeUx Heron was in a state of mind such as no danger to himseU could have produced. He paced with disordered strides the spacious breakfast room of Castleneau House, and as neither Edith nor her aunt could suggest any thing that would be likely to be beneficial to Tom Eipon, they could only for a time sympa thise in sUence with the emotion and the regrets of Heron. \"What has this witness to say?\" asked the judge. \" A witness, my lord,\" said Wild, \" to the identity of the prisoner at the bar.\" Heron then saw aU the danger of the situa tion. \" The prisoner at the bar,\" he said, \" is called Jaoob Gray, and he is my servant.\" Heron hoped that this would be hint sufficient for Mortification, and so it might have been under ordinary circumstances, but the punches and thumps from Jonathan WUd had been so confusing and perplexing, that Mortification, with all the will in the world to be of eirvice to Tom, became at that moment unwillingly his greatest enemy. \" Look, sir, at the prisoner at the bar,\" cried the prosecuting counsel, \"and U you know him name him at once to his lordship and the jury.\" \" Yea, it is Thomas Eipon ; and who should know him better than I, his paternal relative-in- Suddenly he turned and addressed them both. \" I blame myseU,\" he cried, \" for all this.\" \" Yourself, Felix ? How can you blame your seU?\" \" In this way, Edith : because the scheme de served to fad. It was a bad one, and I wonder at myseU now for listening to it for a moment.\" \"Bight,\" cried Lady Castleneau, with her usual energy. \" Yes,\" added Eeroa, \" I sey th.9 scheme de served to saU, for it wss bassd upon deception, untruth, and perjury, and therefore it is that I blame myself most bitterly for eai.risg iflto gaeb a plan.\" Edith was silent law?\" WUd uttered a hideous laugh.

Old Anthony stood in the haU, doubtful whether or not to answer the violent summons for admission. Felix Heron caUed down to him over the ba lustrades of the grand staircase. \" Certainly not !\" exclaimed Lady Castleneau. \" I will myself immediately set about making what interest I can for his pardon and re lease.\" \"Let them in, Anthony,\" he said ; \" bat delay time for a few minutes, if you can ; there will be no danger.\" Heron then hurried back to the apartment where he had left Edith and Lady Castleneau. \" It wiU be aU in vain,\" said Heron. \" The King is out of town ; and if he were not, I am confident that any effort in that quarter would be but waste of time.\" \" It is Jonathan Wild,\" he said, \" with some of his janissaries at his heels.\" \" Oli, Felix, Felix,\" exclaimed Edith \" we are lost!\" \" What is to be done ?\" said Edith. \" I scarcely know, but I must have time to think. Be assured, however, of one thing, Edith, and you, too, dear Lady Castleneau \u2014 that whatever is done shaU be done boldly and speedily.\" \" Then it wfll succeed,\" rephed Lady Castle neau : \" and it is only necessary to take care of one thing, which is that the sacrifice is not too great for the object.\" Edith turned pale at these words. She divined weU what her aunt meant, and she feared that Felix Heron would adopt some course for the purpose of saving Tom Eipon that might hurry him into the greatest personal danger. It took but a glance from FeUx Heron to di vine Edith's thoughts. \" No,\" he said, \" do not think me so rash. There is ample time for reflection, and whatever I do, although it shaU be done boldly and ener getically, shall not be done wfldly, or without ample preparation. Let us say no more about it Here I can make the necessary change in my apparel to restore me to the outward appearance of Captain Fantome. You, too, Edith, need no longer personate Lady Travers. We wiU pro ceed homeward, and I promise that nothing shaU be done without due and fuU consideration.\" \" Not so \u2014 not so. No doubt by some means he has traced us to this house ; but he will seek us as Colonel and Lady Travers, not as Captain Fantome and the Countess of Whitcombe.\" Even as he spoke. Heron quickly threw off the over clothing that he wore to represent the elderly officer, Colonel Travers. In order to increase his bulk, which ailed so much in an effectual disguise, Heron wore that suit of clothes completely over his ordinary dress as Captain Fantome. The change was therefore quickly effected. Edith went through the same process ; and be fore old Anthony actuaUy opened the iron gates for admission of Jonathan Wild and his janis saries, aU traces of the mock Colonel Travers and Lady Travers had disappeared completely. The discarded clothing was thrust into one of the old box window-seats, \"which were curious appendages in houses of that antiquity. Lady Castleneau looked firm and resolute. She drew a small table towards her, and com- menced her work. Heron sat on a couch, and took up a book. Edith sat on a small footstool at the feet of her aunt, and appeared to be winding some silk. \" Mr. Jonathan WUd !'.' announced Anthony, opening the door of the apartment and striving at the same time to block up its entrance. The old man was roughly pushed aside, and Wild strode into the room. A loud ringing at the large bell which hung over the iron gates of Castleneau House at this moment attracted general attention. The mark of the blow that Felix Heron had given him in the court of the OW BaUey was clearly to be seen upon bis face. He glared about him like some ferocious animal, newly issued from its den in the woods, and seek ing for prey. Lady Castleneau looked up calmly. Felix Heron put down his book. . They all fixed their regards upon Jonathan Wild, who did not utter a word until he had searched with his eyes into every corner of the apartment \"Your servant, Lady Castleneau!\" he theD eried, sneeringly ; \" you have visitors, but I have not the pleasure of seeing all of them.\" Lady Castleneau rose with dignity, and ad vanced two steps. \" Ah !\" exclaimed Heron : \" you have an im patient visitor, Aunt Castleneau.\" \" No,\" she repUed, \" I have no impatient visi tors ; and when any one rings the bell of this house in such a fashion it is more likely to be an enemy.\" Whoever it was that had hold of the iron handle of the beU at the gate of Castleneau House was evidently indisposed to let it go again, for the ringing continued a full minute without interruption. There. was a smaU room over the ha!l, with a pretty stained glass window, through which a view could be obtained of the whole court-yard and the iron gates. Heron made a sign to Edith to remain where she was, aud repairing to that room, he soon saw who it was that demanded admission so noisfly to Castieneau House. \"And how dare, the ruffian Jonathan Wild,'' she said, \" intrude himseU into this house, or make question about me or my visitors ?\" \" That's right !\" cried Wild, \" carry it off with a high hand. I always admired your ladyship, you have what I coU pluck ; but that's not to the purpose. I want to know it you honour by Six mounted men were there, headed by Jona than Wild himself.

The mitiu is sufficient, since it assures me that they are in Castleneau House.\" Jonathan WUd put a whistle to his lips, and blew it shriUy. A couple of his men came roughly into the room. \" Mr. Wild!\" said Heron. \" Sir, to you !\" \" Do you know me ?\" \" Ha, ha ! Oh, yes, I know you !

Heron walked quietly back to the couch upon which he had been seated, and resumed his book. \" Hflloa !\" shouted WUd from the garden, \" that was not badly done, and I'm haU reconcUed to your marriage with the Countess of Whitcombe.\" A smUe crossed the face of Edith, and Heron spoke in a low voice: \"The rascal measures everybody merely by his strength and courage. I cannot find in my heart to kUl him, because I still beUeve that in his rough, brutal nature he means weU to you, Edith, and our Uttle one. The very anger he exhibits at your supposed marriage with some one else is something in his favour.\" \" It shows,\" said I-ady Castleneau, \"that even in the most depraved natures there is something that shows humanity is no; whoUy lost, and which makes the whole world kin.\" \" Hush !\" said Heron ; \" he speaks again.\" \" Captain Fantome ! Captain Fantome !\" Heron went to the window. \"I give it up for the present,\" added WUd. \" My men can't find their game, but it won't be lost for long ; and if you are an acquaintance of this Colonel Travers \u2014 which doubtless you are \u2014 you'll let him know that Jonathan WUd is on his track, and that he is as certain to be run down as ever was hunted hare.\" \"Begone !\" said Heron. \" Take yourseU and your men from these premises, or worse wiU happen to you.\" \"What wiU you do next ?\" \" If I have to come down to you, I wfll fling you and your men, one by one, over the garden waU into Bloomsbury Fields.\" \" Captain Fantome !\" \"Well, sir?\" \" Sink me, it I don't begin to like you very much, so good day to you ! We're off, and if you wish to see the little hanging match next Monday at Tybum, just come to me, and I'll get you a capital place.\" Jonathan WUd caUed his men together, and mounting their horses, they left Castleneau House in peace and quiet The determination of Felix to rescue Tom Eipon at all hazards never flagged for a moment. On the Sunday evening previous to the execu tion Heron held a long and mysterious conference with Ogle. \" And I know you. But that is no reason why you should intrude your ugly brutahty into this apartment\" \" My what ?\" \u2022' Your ugly brutality, I said. Do you not see there are ladies here?\" \" What then ?\"' \" You must mistake them for pigs, since a sty would be your proper place.\" Wild scowled upon Heron ferociously. \"Perhaps,\" he said, \"it would be a Uttle wiser for Captain Fantome to keep a civU tongue in his head. There's my warrant !\" WUd, as he spoke, took from hi. breast pocket a 6lip of parchment, and flunj si =\u00bb to the floor. \" There's my warrant to search Jo' and arrest Colonel Travers and whoever may be in his company.\" \"It may be so,\" said Heron, quietly; \"but that does not authorize your intrusion into this apartment.\" \" Authorized, or not, I mean to stay here till my men make their report !\" Heron took out his watch, and laid it on the table before him. \"H you don't go in three minutes,\" he said, \" I wUl throw you out at that window !\" \" You \u2014 you ?\" \" I have said it !\" \" Ha, ha ! There never was but one man in the world who could do that, and he is dead and gone. The Earl of Whitcombe might have managed it, and even did it once, but Captain Fantome is quite another personage.\" \" You will find yourself mistaken,\" said Heron. \" Since I have had the happiness of calling the Countess of Whitcombe my wife, I feel myseU quite capable in every respect of fulfiUing all the conditions of my predecessor's existence.\" \"Oh, you do?\" \"I do. Now, Mr. Wild, are you going?\" \"Not U I know it!\" \" Then you shall be enUghtened!\" Heron had collected all his energies for a spring, as what he intended to do was just one of those actions that depended for its success upon the rapidity with which it was accompUshed. WUd either really did not expect the attack at all, or did not expect it so soon, and therefore he could not readily disentangle himseU from the chair, considering the rather compUcated way in which he sat upon it. Never had Heron exhibited more completely that tremendous latent strength which he pos sessed than upon this occasion. The result of this conference was that Daisy was groomed and looked to with excessive care. Ogle might have been seen Ukewise carrying to the stable a vaUse, such as was usuaUy car ried by horsemen, fastened to the back of the saddle. Without a pause, and apparently without an effort, he Ufted Jonathan Wild, chair and all, and dashed him through the nearest window into the garden. Carefully, likewise, and taking a full quarter of an hour over the operation, Ogle loaded Heron's pistols, and placed them in the holsters. AU these preparations being completed, Ogle made himself a bed on the top of an old corn-bin, and consigned himself to repose. It was about four o'clock on the foUowing morning that Ogle was awakened by a step in the stable. \" Well done !\" cried Lady Castleneau. \" I shaU never pay a glazier's bUl with such pleasure aB this one.\" Wild was so entirely taken by surprise that he uttered not the slightest sound, and it was weU for him that the vegetation of the old garden of Castleneau House was redundant and left to grow in its own wild and wayward fashion, for other wise he might have sustained serious injury.

Ogle was on his feet before Heron had done City, without meeting more than half-a-dozen casual passengers. He was dressed in his ordinary costume as Captain Fantome, of the royal navy, but over it he wore a great coat with large lappels and a couple of capes, for such was the fashion at that time. speaking. \" AU's right, Captain ! Ill have Daisy out, and the other horse, In less than two minutes.\" \" No, Ogle, not the other horse.\" \" Captain !\" \" Silence, and listen to me. I have considered this matter weU from the only point of view at which I ought to consider it, and starting with the proposition that cannot be gainsaid, which is that Tom Bipon must be saved at aU hazards.

This accomplished, he rode up to the entrance of the inn yard on Snow HiU known as the Saracen's Head. \"But, Captain \" \" Hear me out. I know what you would say. Our original arrangement was that you were to go with me upon what I admit wUl be a hazard ous enterprise. In fact, so hazardous, that the only thing which gives it a chance of success is its excessive boldness.\" \" Do not, Captain, take away some of those chances of success by depriving yourseU of my assistance.\" The inn was not open, for the earliest coach had no idea of starting for a full good two hours. A lazy-looking ostler, however, was standing at tho entrance of the archway, with a straw in his mouth, in a very contemplative mood. \" I fuUy appreciate your assistance, Ogle ; and, to prove to you that I do so, I mean to go alone.\" Heron drew up abruptly. \" HiUoa, my friend!\" he said; \"you seem to have it all your own way here.\" \" WeU, sir, I'm caUed Early Joe, because I'm up first\" \" And what wakes you up first ?\" \" The York fly, sir.\" \"York fly?\" \" Yes, sir. That's the waggon as does tne distance from York to London in three nights and two days. That's what I call good going, sir \u2014 ain't it ?\" u An odd way of proving it, Captain.\" u Not so. If I succeed in saving Tom Bipon, it wUl be by taking everybody by surprise. If once the mounted pohce, and the officers of the prison who wiU be accompanying the procession to Tyburn, recover from that surprise, they will be more than a match for half-a-dozen well armed men.\" Ogle was silent. \" Therefore, you see,\" added Heron, \" that al though I might involve you in my own destruc tion, I am just as likely to succeed without you as with you.\" \" But still, Captain, why not take me ?\" \" Because I want to go with a Ughter heart on this enterprise ; and, by you staying here to pro tect Edith and our little one, I shall have that lighter heart. Are you answered, Ogle ?\" \" I am, Captain.\" \" Then saddle Daisy at once, and let me be off.\" \"I dare say it is,\" said Heron; \"and if you will get out of the way I wid ride into the inn yard.\" \" All's right, sir ! Going to put up here ?\" \" I am.\" \" Oh, my eye, she is a beauty ! Well, I neverl You are a beauty ! One of a thousand, you are ! It's a honour to attend on yer ! You are indeed a beauty ! The under ostler was walking round and round Daisy as he uttered these expressions of admira tion. Ogle obeyed FeUx Heron, but it was evidently with a heavy heart that he did so. Daisy was carefully saddled and bridled for the Toad, and the little travelling valise which had been brought into the stable was strapped to the back of the saddle. \" Lead her out,\" said Heron. \" I wUl mount in the little narrow street beyond.\" Daisy was led out from the stable, and in a few seconds Heron was mounted. \"Farewell for the present,\" he said. \"I go forth with your good wishes, Ogle ; and be as sured that, as far as human judgment goes, I am doing all for the best.\" \" Yes, Captain\u2014 yes,\" said Ogle, in a choking voice. \" I will try to beUeve that, and may heaven protect you !\" Another moment, and Daisy and Captain Heron had gone. Ogle closed the stable door with a deep sigh. At that early hour of the morning the streets of London were tolerably deserted, and Heron trotted down Holborn, in the direction of the \" I am glad you admire my horse,\" said Heron, \" for it will induce you to take care of her. I want to know the exact stable in which you wUl put her ; and, as she needs no grooming, you can give me the key.\" \" Just as you please, sir. I'd be as particular as you U this here beauty was mine ; and I teU you what, sir \u2014 the only creature in aU the world that's her equal is the famous Daisy that used to belong to Captain Heron, of Epping Forest\" \" Indeed ! Did you ever see her ?\" \" No, sir ; but I've heard her spoke of.\" \"WeU, well \u2014 that wUl do. I want some breakfast as soon as the house is stirring.\" The ostler showed Daisy into one of the best stables of the estabUshment ; and Heron, after taking the valise from the back of the saddle, locked the stable door carefuUy, placing the key in one of his pockets. The ostler rang one of the house-bells, and a half-sleepy waiter soon made his appearance,"], [274, "I I I 268 EPITH HERON. I I Saracen's Head inn, and then he darted into the back room of the two he occupied. who ushered Heron into two private apartments, a bed-room and a sitting-room. Heron at once walked to the windows. \" A good view you have here,\" he said. \"Yes, sir; it's beautiful. You can see the whole of Newgate ; and only last week we had two men in the piflory, and it was quite pleasant to see the crowd pelting them with rotten eggs.\" \" It must have been. I will sit here. Let me have breakfast as soon as possible.\" The valise was open, and strewed upon the bed were various articles of clothing. Eapidly, FeUx Heron exchanged his outer gar ments for those which the vaUse had contained, and in less than five minutes he stood in the complete costume which he was in the habit of wearing in Epping Forest, when at the head of that daring band of men, who for so long a period had caUed him Captain. All disguise whatever was thrown aside. As the veritable Captain FeUx Heron he now appeared, with the resolution, in his own proper character, to saUy forth in the open face of day and dare the observation of aU the world. \" Yes, sir. Hem ! by the bye, sir, you will be quite amused about half-past eleven o'clock.\" \"At what?\" \" Why, sir, it's hanging morning ; and they say there's a mere boy, who is a highwayman, though, for aU that, who wfll be taken to Ty burn, and put out of the way. You'U 6ee it, sir, beautiful from that window.\" Heron took one glance again from the front window. \" I have no doubt of it,\" said Heron. \" Yes, sir. Breakfast, sir \u2014 directly, sir.\" The Sheriff had just arrived in his gUt coach. The procession was forming. \"Forward!\" cried one of the officers. Heron was alone. The death-cart wa3 put into motion, and Tom Eipon commenced what every one thought would be his ride to Tyburn. Mounted on the horse which had been taken round to his house, Jonathan Wild joined the procession at the corner of St. Sepulchre's Churchyard, and from that moment he took the command of the whole affair. He paced the room impatiently. \" I shall have a long vigil here,\" he said : \" but it was quite necessary to get here early, to avoid observation and remark.\" In the course of haU-an-hour a substantial re past was placed before Heron, and the waiter again expatiated upon the beauty of the view from the window. Heron could not hear what he said, but he saw him point with his heavy riding whip in the direction of Holborn Bridge. The weary hours passed away. It was eleven o'clock. A great crowd of people began to assemble in front of Newgate. Field Lane and the neighbourhood of Smith field sent forth its hordes of ruffianism on this occasion, as the escort of the death-cart to Ty burn. Heron's time had come. In half a dozen seconds he was in the inn yard, and Daisy's stable door was unlocked. \" Ho ! Daisy, come forth \u2014 come forth !\" Daisy bounded out of the stable, and the ostler had only time to cry out, \" Good gracious !\" before Heron was on her back, and at a rattUng pace saUied out on to Snow HU1. Precisely at a quarter past eleven the beU of Newgate began to toU. A pair of gates close to the entrance of the court of Old Bailey were flung open. A large cart lumbered forth, drawn by a block dray-horse of great size and strength. At the bottom of the cart was a quantity of straw, and placed rather conspicuously across it was a coffin. Had he timed it in the most accurate manner in the world, Heron could not have issued forth from the yard of the \" Saracen's Head \" at a more exactly opportune moment. Jonathan WUd was precisely on the spot of ground outside the archway. Then there issued from the same gateway a strong party of mounted police. Then Heron reined in Daisy, until she stood for a moment on her hind feet like some beautiful statue of a horse, and he looked straight into the eyes of Jonathan Wild. There were no less than eighteen One of these led a horse without a rider, and the moment he was well clear of tho gateway, he went at a 6harp trot round to Newgate Street. Heron had no difficulty in divining what this meant. It was Wild's horse, being taken round to his own house for him to mount. The mouth of the great thief-taker opened as though he would have uttered a cry of terror, but the sound froze upon his lips, and for a few seconds he and FeUx Heron confronted each other in petrifying and fearful silence. Then the Chaplain of Newgate came down the steps of the Governor's house, and was assisted into the cart by a couple of the officers. A yell and a shout from the crowd next an nounced the arrival of a personage always un- Then Heron made an imperious movement with his hand. Wild obeyed him and began backing his horse, and at the same moment his frozen up faculties found power of expression. \"Help! help!\" he cried \u2014 \" a ghost ! \u2014 an ap parition ! It's the spirit of Felix Heron, and an air surrounds him that freezes me to the bones. Help! help! The dead rise up against us !\" StUl Heron made that imperious gesture, and WUd, backing bis horse among the mounted con stables, threw them into confusion. Tom Bipon raised a ringing cheer, and spring ing over the chaplain, he reached the side of the popular. That was the hangman, who, with his head bowed down to his breast, and only glancing up now and then with a deprecating air at the angry faces about him, mounted the front part of the cart, and took the reins in his hand. Then there was a strange cry \u2014 haU shout, haU groan \u2014 as Tom Bipon was brought forth with fetters on his limbs, and with very little ceremony hustled into the cart. cart. \" Saved! saved !\" he oried. \" Hurrah! hurrah ! Heron saw all this from the window of the"], [275, "269 EDITH HERON. I Never say die ! Who said the Captain wouldn't come, and Daisy too ? How are you, Daisy ? AU right, eh ? Hurrah ! hurrah !\" Heron spoke truly when he told Ogle that Tom's rescue was to be effected by surprise, and not by force. He gave the impulse to Daisy, and with one leap she was by the side of the cart. Tom was on her back in an instant, and not withstanding his fetters, he contrived to get a firm clutch of Heron's scarlet coat. by some deep bass note3 which proceeded from the lungs of the honest blacksmith himseU. Heron puUed up at the door of the black smith. \" HUloa, my friend !\" he said; \"here's a job for you.\" \"Ah! it's aU grist to the mill!\" exclaimed the blacksmith. \" I find it hard work to live in this lonely place. Has your horse cast a shoe, sir?\" \" No, my man, that's not it. I want you to take these fetters off this boy here.\" \"Fetters, sir?\" \" Off and away ! off and away, Daisy !\" shouted Tom. \" There's not a dozen horses, aU roUed into one, in the whole of England, can catch you.\" Heron had never spoken a word, but now, turning the head of Daisy towards Giltspnr Street, where there was no crowd at all, he put Daisy to speed, and the last he saw of Jonathan Wild was his being helpod off his horse, ap parently in a swoon, by the officers that sur lounded him. \" Yes. Don't you see it wUl be weU worth your whUe to do so ; and, hark you, my friend, a stiU tongue makes a wise head. You under stand ?\" \" AU's right, sir \u2014 here goes !\" The blacksmith, with a few blows of his ham- mer, soon rendered Tom quite at Uberty, who threw his arms high above bis head shouting, \" Hurrah ! hurrah ! Now I'm a man again !\" The blacksmith laughed. Tom's exuberance had passed away, and now, for the first time we may almost say, the awful position in which he had been placed seemed to take possession of his mind. It was well that he had so good a support to cling to, for he began now to feel weak and faint. \" A very young one, it would seem to me,\" he said, as he picked up some silver pieces Felii Heron had cast on the floor of his hut. \" Thanks, your honour \u2014 thanks ! And if so be there be any questions asked of Tim Simpson, why, mum's the word.\" \" I see you are a sensible man,\" repUed FeUx Heron, as he and Tom again prepared to con tinue their journey. \" Where are we going now, Captain ?\" asked Tom, as Felix Heron stUl pushed forward towards the country. \" I scarcely know yet, Tom, but I will wait untU nightfall at an inn, where I know we may avoid pursuit ; and then, I think, we may as weU return to Whitcombe House. Heron spoke, but he did not relax his horse's speed. \" Come, Tom, be a man. If we succeed in dis tancing our pursuers, we shaU have nothing to fear.\" Tom gave one sob\u2014 the boy felt aU the peril his beloved master had run for his sake, but he could not utter a word. FeUx Heron, with his disengaged hand, pressed one of Tom Eipon's, and said, in his own cheery accents, \" It's all right, Tom ; you have been imprudent, but I do not blame you so much as my6eU.\" \"Oh, don't \u2014 don't, Captain, talk in that fashion, now !\" said Tom \u2014 for he could not bear to hear FeUx Heron blame himself in any way. \" Don't talk in that fashion, Captain ! You ought to have let them hang me \u2014 I deserve it !\" \" Pooh, pooh, Tom ! you must be wiser next time ! Ah ! we must push on : there is a large mounted party of officers in pursuit. On, Daisy, on! Off and away!\" Daisy sped on like the wind; and, in the course of another haU-hour, FeUx Heron and Tom Eipon had ridden some miles into the country, and there was no appearance of any one in their track. Tom whistled. \" We must then,\" continued Heron, \" think of some disguise for you to adopt until this little affair is forgotten. \" AU's right, Captain ; anything you advise is sure to be right.\" Heron could not suppress a smile. \" You did not think it necessary to ask my advice, Tom, when you got yourseU into this sad dilemma,\" he replied. \" Don't talk about it, Captain ; I feel as if I could never forgive myseU. But is this the inn, Captain, you spoke of ?\" \"It is,\" said Felix Heron; and giving the reins to Tom, he entered the Uttle hostel, and whispered a few words into the ear of the land- lord, who answered, \u2014 \" Certainly, sir \u2014 certainly ! Here you wUl be as safe as a mouse i;i a trap. I do say it as oughtn't; but when a gentleman asks for pri- vacy in Ned Swallow's hostel, why Ned SwaUow knows what he's about, and can keep a secret as weU as anybody.\" At this moment there was a pattering of horses' feet upon the road, and Felix Heron and Tom Eipon had just time to enter the Uttle hostel, and place Daisy in a place of security, when a party of mounted officers appeared at the door. Heron drew rein. \" Now, Tom,\" said Felix Heron, \" we must get your fetters removed at the first blacksmith's forge we come to.\" \" That will be a good riddance, at all events, Captain,\" said Tom, who now began to regain his usual cheerfulness. Captain Heron suffered Daisy now to go at a hand-gallop; and not many paces in advance he saw a blacksmith's forge, so often to be met with on country roads. As they approached the little hut \u2014 for it more resembled that than anything else \u2014 FeUx Heron and Tom could distinctly hear the heavy blows of the smith's hammer upon the anvU, enlivened \"HUloa! Hilloa, there!\" shouted one. \"Has a man on horseback passed this way, carrying a boy in fetters behind him ?\""], [276, "EDITH HERON. 270 \" To me,\" said Warringdale ; and there was a baleful Ught in his eyes as he spoke. John Tarleton looked at his companion for a few seconds without speaking. \" H he were disposed of,\" continued Warring dale, in a low voice, which now sunk almost to a whisper, \" the only obstacle in my way would be removed !\" \" God bless my heart, your honour !\". cried the landlord. \" A boy in fetters ?\" \" Yes, yes ! Don't stand there gaping like an idiot, but answer 1 Have you seen two such persons?\" asked the officer. \" Certainly not, sir ! A boy in fetters, indeed ! He would know too weU that this was not the sort of crib for the like of such as he.

It's worth thinking about,\" saiS Tarleton. \" But say how is it to be accompUshed, and who is to do the deed \u2014 for it is murder ol course that you propose ?\" \"Pshaw!\" exclaimed the officer who had aU along been spokesman. \" Don't hinder us by ask ing us any of your tiresome questions.

In a small bnt weU-appointed apartment in an hotel at the West End of town sat two men. \"You are a great vUlain, Warringdale,*' he said. \" But, as you say, better put a little chUd out of the world than you or I. What are your plans?\" \" These,\" said Warringdale, as he drew his chair closer to John Tarleton's. \" These. I pro pose to make my way into Whitcombe House, and secrete myseU in one of its many hiding places, and in the dead of night I wiU manage to let you in, and together we wUl proceed to the apartment occupied by the child and his nurse.\" \" And what then ?\" asked John Tarleton. It is late in the evening, and the remains of a substantial repast were stiU on the table, together with some of the choicest wine the cellar could produce. \" And now to business,\" said one of these choice spirits to the other ; \"but first fiU a bumper and let us wish success to our plans \u2014 or, at least, your plans, I may say, for at present I am quite in the dark as to the business on hand.\" It was John Tarleton who spoke. His companion was none other than Lord Warringdale. Warringdale filled his glass, and drained off its contents. \" Why, I wUl manage the nurse, while you do the business with the Uttle one.\" John Tarleton fiUed his glass again and drained it before he spoke ; he then said, \" WeU, here's my hand on it Bemember, if I share the danger, I also share the plunder.\" \" Most assuredly you shall ! But, hark ! there are footsteps. Who can it be at this hour ? They approach this door \u2014 we have spoken too loud.

Any one would think you \" \" Hush !\" said Warringdale, starting and turn ing pale. \" What was that ? Did you hear any thing?\" \" Nothing !\" roared John Tarleton. \" You are enough to make any one beUeve he is surrounded by spirits!\" \u2014 and taking a decanter up, he again filled his glass, saying, \" Take another glass, Warringdale, to give you pluck ; and make haste and tell me what this precious plan of yours is, which you were so desirous of imparting to me to-night, and which you said was to give us both a fortune.\" John Tarleton and Warringdale sprung to their feet, and encountered the eyes of Jonathan Wild fixed upon them. \" You look scared, gentlemen,\" he said, as he sunk into the first chair that presented itself\u2014 \u00ab \" you look scared, gentlemen. Your conversation must have been very interesting. You tremble^ my Lord Warringdale ; and you, John Tarleton, look as if you had seen No, no!

True she has disappointed me there; but stiU Captain Fantome is a brave man, and perhaps he has other quaUties resembling those possessed by Felix Heron, which may have won her regard.\" \" DoubUess !\" sneered John Tarleton. \" Whose ? Speak, man, and don't talk fables here! Whose ghost have you seen? Speak!\" \" FeUx Heron's !\" Warringdale staggered back until he reached the chair from which he had risen to give Jonathan WUd the wine. \"FeUx Heron's?\" he gasped. \" Even so !\" said WUd, in a low tone ; \" even bo ! That boy, Tom Eipon, warned me that he might appear at any time to rescue from danger those who were attached to him ; and he did so to-day, when I thought nothing could save that boy from the death he so richly deserves.\" Lord Warringdale and John Tarleton regarded each other in sUence, while WUd continued, \" Yes, at the moment when I thought all secure, FeUx Heron appeared, even as he used to do of old, when he was at the head of his band in the re cesses of Epping Forest\" \"And she may have wished,\" continued Jonathan WUd, \"to give her Uttle son a pro tector.\" \" I have no doubt,\" said Warringdale, \" that was her only reason for so soon forgetting the gaUant FeUx Heron. Ha, ha !\" Wild rose to his feet, and looking Warringdale and John Tarleton in the face, he said, \" Beware, how you speak of FeUx Heron's chUd ! The boy shall never want a protector while Jonathan WUd Uves !\" \" This is past belief,\" said Warringdale, now turning as pale as Wild himself had done a few minutes before. \" What said he ?\" In another moment the two companions in iniquity were alone. \" Nothing !\" repUed WUd. \" H he had spoken, it would not have been hatf so terrible ; but he gUded through the crowd as only an apparition could do, mounted on the back of Daisy, and made his way right to the side of the death-cart\" \"And what happened then ?\" asked Warring dale. As soon as the echo of Jonathan WUd's footsteps had ceased to vibrate in their ears, Lord Warringdale and John Tarleton drew a long breath of rehef. \" What could he mean ?\" asked Warringdale. in a low voice, \"by talking so much about that brat of FeUx Heron's ?\" \" Tom Bipon leaped upon Daisy's back behind the apparition, and they were soon lost to view. I believe they vanished into thin air.\" \" What mean you ?\" asked John Tarleton. \" Did not the officers seize them ?\" \" I can't think. But I am convinced that we were not overheard talking over our Uttle scheme for the improvement of both of our fortunes.\" \" I don't know. I don't half like it,\" said Warringdale. \" He would not let us know he had heard anything. What did he come for? I forget.\" \" Why,\" replied John Tarleton, \"to tell us he had seen FeUx Heron's ghost, to be sure.\" \" True \u2014 true ! and that very naturally led him to speak of the Countess and her child.\" \" To be sure it did ! So now let us. mature our Uttle plans. When is the business to be done?\" \" How could they seize upon a spirit ? I saw only that the crowd shrunk back, and then I feU into a swoon ; for the look of that face froze every drop of blood in my veins.\" As WUd spoke, a shudder passed through his frame, and he rested his head upon his clasped hands. \" Heaven knows,\" he murmured, apparently oblivious of the fact that he was not alone, \u2014 \" Heaven knows, I would have befriended Edith and his Uttle one. Why should he thus appear to me ? I wish now I had not pursued that boy with such relentless hatred, but he drove me to it by his obstinacy.\" Warringdale started from a reverie. \" The sooner the better ! \u2014 the sooner the bet- ter!\" he cried, excitedly. \"To-morrow night we must make our way into the stable-yard from the narrow street that runs at the back of Whitcombe House. I, at an earlier hour ; you,, at about two o'clock in the morning.\" \" Since when,\" asked Lord Warringdale, with a sneer, \u2014 \" since when, pray, have you become so devoted to the Countess of Whitcombe and her ChUd ?\" \" All right \u2014 then, it's agreed ! What death is he to die? A pistol-shot does the business quickly ; but it makes such a confounded noise.\" Warringdale drained off another tumbler of wine. WUd started. \"Since when?\" he asked. \"Since when, do you ask, have I become so devoted to the Countess of Whitcombe? I wUl teU you, my Lord War ringdale, and you too, John Tarleton \u2014 ever since the death of that gallant, brave, and generous Felix Heron.\" \"Indeed!\" sneered Warringdale. \"You were not always incUned to be so friendly. Perhaps you wUl kindly favour us with tho cause of this violent friendship ?\" \" Pshaw !\" said Wild. \" You would not under stand me. I scarcely understand it myself. All I know is, that whatever may have been my feel ing towards Felix Heron at one time, I w_l never relax in -ny vigilance in doing all I can to ward off danger or Ul-fortune to either the Countess of Whitcombe or her child \u2014 his chUd.\" \"Ton my wort WUd, it is a pity the fair \" Let it be the knife, keen and trustworthy.\" \" Be it so, then,\" said Tarleton. \" After aU, I am only her haU-brother.\" \" HaU-brother or whole-brother, what matters it when the stake we play for is so worth the having ?

TOM RIPON SAVES FELIX HERON'S CHILD FBOM A HORRIBLE DEATH. \" I was thinking,\" said Tom. \" Thinking, Tom ! So I suppose ; but what were you thinking about ?\" \" I was wondering who would have the care of Daisy in future, Captain!\" \u2014 and Tom gave a deep Bigh. \" Tom Eipon,\" replied Heron. \" I, Captain ?\" \" Certainly, Tom. I am not afraid of you risking her lUe again without my permission ; and as in other respects she could not have a better groom, nor one who loved her more truly, why I think I am only carrying out Daisy's own wishes on the subject by again entrusting her to you. Eh, Daisy ?\" As FeUx thus addressed his four-footed friend, he patted her arched neck ; and the creature, really as if she understood the little arrange ment, made a snorting reply, which Tom, as was usual with him, translated into her entire approval of aU that had been said. While Felix Heron was endeavouring' to make Edith laugh at her fears, Tom Eipon, with Ogle, had made his way to the kitchen, where Mrs. Ogle bustled about with as good a wUl as did her husband, in order to provide Tom with some substantial proofs of their pleasure at his safe return. Tom's spirits had completely regained their wonted elasticity, now that he felt Felix Heron had forgiven him for exposing, not only himself, but Daisy, to so much danger. \" Ah ! there she is !\" shouted Tom, as he bounded into the kitchen, and clasped Mrs. Ogle in his arms. \" Give me a kiss !\" \" Get out !\" shouted Mrs. Ogle. \" I don't want to kiss any such reprobate as you are !\" \" Oh, that's gammon !\" cried Tom, stUl tor menting Mrs. Ogle. \" TeU me now, Ogle, hasn't she been weeping and wafling ever since I've been gone ?\" Ogle smiled ; \u2014 for now that both FeUx Heron and his young favourite were in safety again, he rather enjoyed Tom's good-humoured jokes. \" Me weeping and wailing ?\" said Mrs. Ogle, with an attempt at seriousness. \" I should think not ! The house has been quiet and peaceable since you left !\" Tom laughed, and sat down to a weU-f urnished table ; and while he was doing ample justice to the good things Mrs. Ogle had provided for him, he gave them a hurried account of all that had befallen him. \"Thank you, Captain,\" said the boy; \"you may rely upon me never putting her in peril again; and as for attending properly to her, why, I'd rather go without food myself than let her want for anything.\" \" I know that, Tom,\" said FeUx Heron, a3 they reached the stable-door, at which Heron knocked impatiently. He had not many seconds to wait, for Ogle had been told by Heron that he would dismount in the stable-yard, whether he was fortunate enough to rescue Tom or not. The joy of Ogle at beholding Captain Heron and Tom safe and weU was too great for words, \u00bbad he merely said in a choking voice, \" Thank heaven, Captain, you have returned in safety !\" \"All right, Ogle!\" said Tom; \" you see Johnny has not been gratified by seeing me dancing upon nothing, as he thought he should !\" Captain Heron saw that Tom put on a look and air of playfulness' to hide some deeper emotion, which was clearly perceptible in his voice. Twelve o'clock struck, and Tom, rubbing his eyes, expressed a wish to retire to bis own little room, saying as he did so that much as he had always liked it before, since he had been a guest of Jonathan WUd's he should value it more than ever. In another haU-hour, the inmates of Whit combe House had retired to rest. Tom, when he once more felt that he was free, and that he could look forward to a quiet night's rest in his own Uttle bed, gave a long sigh of relief as he sat down, and rested his head on his hands in deep thought. In fact, this may bo said to bo the first time that Tom had really reflected upon his pecuUar position ; \u2014 for although he scarcely could have given utterance to the belief in words, yet he had always thought, in his own mind, that FeUx Heron would make an attempt to rescue him ; aud Tom had such unbounded confidence in whatever his Captain \u2014 for such he stiU caUed, him \u2014 could accomplish, that perhaps he, Tom, was less surprised than any one else had been when, on that eventful morning, Felix Heron, in the dress he had for so long discarded, rode up to the side of the death-cart and carried him off. \" Here, Ogle, take Tom in, and give him a good supper, for I dare say he has not fared over weU since he has been Jonathan Wild's guest; and I wUl go to Edith, for I daresay she is not less uneasy than you seem to have been, Ogle.\" \" Go, Captain, go ! I never saw the Lady Edith in such a way before ! She has been pacing up and down the drawing-room almost all day, except now and then, when the little one would make her play with him !\" \"Dear Edith!\" sighed FeUx Heron, as he en tered the house ; and mounting two stairs at a time, was soon clasped in the arms of Edith. \"You are safe \u2014 you are safe! Oh, Felix!\" was aU Edith could say, as she burst into a pas sion of tears. Now, however, in the quiet of his little sleep ing apartment Tom knew and felt all that Felix \" Safe, Edith !

In another moment, there came three gentl. tape at tho gate ; and the crouching figure, wliich, as our readers have no doubt already recognised. was none other than Lord Warringdale, opened the gate, and another figure glided in.

We must wait yet another hour, at least.\" \"Are you prepared?\" asked Lord Warring dale. And this time Tom thought he recog nised the tones of tho voice, but could not at the moment recall to his remembrance where, or under what circumstances, he had heard them. Having reached the door of the room, Tom paused to listen. All was stUl, and he felt sure that the two assassins had not yet left their hiding-place. Tom knocked gently at the door of the apart ment, in the hope of rousing Mrs. Ogle, whom he knew had the charge of the child during the night. \"Prepared? Of course I am ! Do you suppose I should be such an idiot as to come unprepared ? In which room does the brat sleep ?\" Tom fairly staggered back. Was it possible that the world contained two such viUains as to wish to harm the little child who was the sun shine, the idol of the house ? What could it all mean? SAS__IA_. There was no reply to his summons for admis sion. \u2022' It's no use waiting' here,\" said Tom to him seU ; \" delay may be fatal. I will go in.\" Tom turned the handle of the door, and en tered. Again Tom projected his head to lister \" He sleeps,\" again repUed the voice wnich Tom now knew to be that of Lord Warringdale, \"in the room they call the Yellow Chamber, quite away from this part of the premises. We must mount the staircase, and while you put an end to him, I wiU undertake to settle the woman, his nurse.\" There was a pause, now, in the conversation. and Tom fancied that they were making some alteration in their dress. Tom was convinced that not only the chiid, but Mi_. Ogle herself, was in a de.p sleep ; and the next thing to be done was to effectually rouse the latter without awakening the child. Tom laid his hand upon her. \" Mrs. Ogle ! Mrs. Ogle ! Hush ! don't make a row! Get up, Mrs. Ogle !\" Mrs Ogle was fortunately too much terrified to make any outcry, which Tom felt all along sbf was sure to do ; but she started up in the bed aud regarded Tom in astonishment. It was no longer to be doubted that these two men, for some reason or another, were bent upon the death of Felix Heron's child. ,..__._. .t^.UVU .__.

'\u25a0Hush! do not make such a noise, and rouse the Captain and Lady Edith. I want you to get up, and let me take charge of the little one for ;_ little while.\" There was a look upon the face of Tom Eipon as he clasped his hands in thankfulness, that lit it up, and made it look beautiful and heroic. \" Yes,\" he said, in a low voice, \u2014 \" yes, I shall be permitted to stand between what Captain Heron values more than his own life \u2014 his child \u2014 and danger, perhaps death ! But I, too, must notbeioUe. Where are the pistols\u2014 in Daisy's holsters ? Ah, no ! here they are. I thought I brought them iu.\" Tom looked to the priming, and saw that they were well apfl carefully loaded. Then he looked again from the little wipdbw. The two men were silent now, evidently wait ing impatiently for the time when they could carry out their villanous project. As Tqijj regarded the two shadows which were crouching beneath the wall which ran along the back part of the house, dividing it from the little narrow street we have before mentioned, his mind was busily occupied in determining upon some scheme to frustrate their evil de signs. \"You want me to leave the child, Tom? Never ! While I have breath, I will protect him.'' At first Tom contemplated rousing Felix Heron, and letting him take summary vengeance upon the would-be murderers of his child ; but, after a few minutes' reflection, he discarded the thought, saying to himself, '\u2022 No, no ! I \u2014 I alone must save Felix Heron's child. Has he not this day risked his life for me, who have no one to live for ? And ho is so beloved ; and the Lady Edith, too, will givo me ono of her own sweet smiles, which I value so much ; and when she looks at Tom Ripon, she will remember that I saved her child ! But now, how is it to be done ? Shall I sally out, and put a bullet in their brains as they lie there ? or shall 1 meet them face to face, in the presence of that innocent child they came to murder?\" \"But, after all,\" added Tom, \"you know, Mr- Ogle, you are only a woman, and it requires ;i man's arm in such an emergency as this.' \" Call Ogle, then,\" said Mrs. Ogle, interrupting Tom. Tom drew himself up, saying, as he pointed to the table, where lay the two pistols he had brought with him, \" I am not afraid but that I shall be able to settle them both with these two friends; so just get up, Mrs. Ogle, and if you l_kt> to remain in the room, why you can, but don't make any noise, that's all.\" \"Gracio - goodness !\" said Mrs. Ogle. ''I'm all in a tremble.\" \u2022'Never mind that,\" said Tom; \" I give you five minutes to put on your traps, and then I shall come back again.'' B you ave uot going away, Tom?\" ask?! Tom seemed to think the latter mode would bo tho most desirable ; for he quickly left his place of espionage- and bounded op-stairs to the"], [281, "275 EDITH HERON.

There was excitement in his eyes, his head was thrown a httle back, and his fingers were upon the triggers of those pistols, each one oi which held the life of a man at his mercy. Tom had not long to wait The door handle gently turned, and then th\u00a9 door opened noiselessly ; and then John Tarleton, with a hunting knife \u2014 whose blade flashed and glittered in the moonbeams \u2014 entered the room, closely followed by his accomplice. \" All right !\" said Mrs. Ogle. Tom was turning to leave the rooir \" Tom !\" \" Well, what now ?\" \" Why, you look by this light, with the morn shioing full on your face and figure, \u2014 you don . look hke a boy any longer, but hke a man.\" \" 1 am a man,\" said Tom, as he strode from the room. So intent were these two men upon the deed of darkness they had come to perpetrate, that it would seem they had not raised their eyes ; had ' they done so, they must have beheld Tom \u00bbs he there stood with the full Ught of the moon upon him. Tom moved not; he could scarcely be said' to breathe ; but his heart beat wildly as he be held these men making their way towards the bed. While the foregoing conversation had been taking place in the child's sleeping apartment between Mrs. Ogle and Tom Eipon, the two vilianous accomplices, Lord Warringdale and John Tarleton, had completed their arrangements \u2014 each drawing over their boots a pair of worsted socks, so that their stealthy footsteps might not be heard. Then they took from their pookets a piece of black crape ; much like those worn at mas querades, which they drew down over their faces. Still they saw him not ; but when John Tarleton was within a pace of the bed, Tom cried out, \" Hold, villains ! murderers that you are ! Another step forward, and I'll scatter your brains as I would those of a mad dog ! What want yoci here ? Speak, or I'll fire !\" Tom advanced a step towards John Tarletoa, who had shrunk back, apparently incapable of uttering a word. \" I'm ready,\" whispered John Tarleton. \" And so am I,\" rephed Warringdale. \" Follow me.\" Lord Warringdale produced from his pocket a pick-lock, with which he had no difficulty in opening the door which led into the lower por tion of the mansion, and the two soon made their way up a back staircase to the suite of apartments which he, Lord Warringdale, had discovered to be set apart for the use of the young heir to the Whitcombe estates. \" Speak, I say, villains ! Why seek you the life of an innocent child ? I know your plot and have frustrated your designs. Leave this' room, this house, my Lord Warringdale; and you, too, John Tarleton \u2014 you see I know you both \u2014 or worse will come of it.\" It was just as Mrs. Ogle had secreted herself behind an old-fashioned wardrobe, and Tom Eipon had taken up his station by the side of the child's bed, that those two villains reached the door of the apartment, and listened intently. Silence reigned in and about the house \u2014 but still they paused. Was it fear that now spoke to the hearts of those two men, that made them pause on the threshold of the room, where lay in peaceful slumber their innocent victim? Tom had given one look at the little sleeper. The rosy flush of childhood was upon the soft cheek, and the moonbeams played among the dark tresses. The senses of both these men of crime seemed paralyzed before the majestic bearing of Tom Eipon, who followed them step by step as they descended backwards the grand staircase. At length they reached the stable-yard, with \u2022 Tom still pointing the muzzle of the pistols at their breasts, and when they were outside the \u2022 httle gate Tom discharged one of them. With a yell of agony, Lord Warringdale rolled over and over. \" That's a keepsake from me. A little re-; membrance of this night's work,\" said Tom,' as he slammed the little gate, and bolted it on' the inside. One tiny hand was outside the coverlet, grasp ing a toy lamb Tom had bought only a few days previous. Tom sped up to the sleeping apartment of the child, and entering, he found Mrs. Ogle giving vent to her feelings in a violent burst of tears, while the child, clasping her round the neck,\" was endeavouring to make her cease weeping. ' \u00bb Tom caught the little one to his breast, aid never had he felt so happy as at that moment. The pistol shot had aroused Felix Heron,' who, fancying he heard unusual sounds in \u25a0 t^e' nursery at that time in the night, hastene* Tom patted the little hand gently, and some thing very bright glittered in the boy's eye as he said, ;' No harm shall come to you, little one. I hope I shall not have to use these noisy weapons, for they will frighten you, may be, and then \" Tom started. A hand was laid upon the handle of the door, \u2014 but it was not turned. Mrs. Ogle sank upon her knees, and hid her face iu the bed-clothes.

It were vain to attempt to describe in language all the various and contending emotions whicli sound a home in the breast of Felix Heron, when he became aware of the imminent peril which had surrounded his much-loved child ; nor less was he touched by the devotion of the brave youth before him, who had stood between his child and that peril. \" Stop, Tom !\" cried Felix Heron. \" I meant not that you should infer from my silence that I disapproved of what you wished to do.\" \" Then you don't disapprove, Captain ?\" asked Tom, breathless with expectation. \" No, Tom, I do not disapprove of your desire to become a knight of the road ; but I would fain have heard you express a desire to become some thing that would not be so perilous. You are young, Tom.\" Tom drew himself up to his full height, as he said, \"I am a good deal taller than Ogle, Captain !\" \" Well, well !\" said Felix Heron, smiling. 1; Be it as you wish, only be more cares ul in brav ing Jonathan Wild.\" \" Then you consent, Captain ?\" \" I consent.\" \" I can never repay you, Tom, for this !\" cried Felix Heron, wringing the hand of his faithful young follower. \" I can never, never repay you for such a service as this !\" Tom's excitement had passed away, and Le seemed to have forgotten all that he himself had really risked in thus saving the child of Felix Heron from the hand of his would-be murderers. \"It's nothing, Captain. You wouldn't have a man stand by and see a little child murdered iu eold blood, without stretching out a hand to save him. I merely did my duty.\" Felix Heron looked on the flushed cheek of the boy with admiration. \" Ilna-ah !

Have you thought of anything that you would like me to do or say, in order to prove to you what my feelings are on this occasion ?\" Tom hastily quitted the room, and, seeking Ogle, he was giving him an animated description of all that had taken place during the last few hours, and of the change of life which was now to be his. Tom was silent. \" Speak, Tom \u2014 speak !

Has she not all that even you can desire for her comfort and well-being ?\" Tom's face flushed ; and, clasping his hands, he advanced two paces nearer to Felix Heron, as he said, \" Oh, Captain, if you think I have done anything to deserve all the kind things you have been saying to me \u2014 which I don't \u2014 if you would only let me have Daisy, I feel sure, with your permission and good wishes, I should, in time, become almost as good and great aa you are.

He would feel more like a real highway man, you see, Captain.\" \" Exactly, Ogle ; and I wish you to procure him one that you think would be suitable ; and let him find it all ready for him to put on to night.\" \" All right, Captain ! I was only debating in my own mind what sort of dress it had better be.\" Heron patted the neck of his favourite steed, and then turned and left the stable. As the reader knows how readily Ogle had entered into Captain Heron's scheme of providing Tom with a suitable outfit for his new under taking, he will have no difficulty in believing that he (Ogle) succeeded to his utmost satis faction in carrying out Felix's Heron's wishes on that subject.

(.iff niguwaymen. Having made them up into a compact bundle, Ogle watched his opportunity, and entering Tom's little sleeping apartment in his absence, displayed the various articles to the best advan tage on the bed and chairs and other furniture in the apartment. The effect was almost startling \u2014 at least, Ogle thought and hoped that it would be ; and it was with some degree of impatience that he busied himself as best he could while waiting for Tom's arrival from Wardour Street ; for even his joy at the anticipated sport on the road that night could not induce him to forego the pleasure of paying the old gal, as he invariably called Mrs. Eipon, a visit to show that he was safe and well. \" Let it be something smart and dashing. scarlet coat, remember, will be indispensable.\" \"All right, Captain,\" 6aidOgle; \"now Iknow what I have to do. I've no doubt I shall give both you and Tom satisfaction.\" \"No doubt of it \u2014 no doubt of it, Ogle,\" said Felix Heron ; and hearing Tom's cheery voice singing in Daisy's stable, he turned his steps thither. Tom was busily engaged in polishing up the harness belonging tp hi6 four-footed friend, and, as usual, holding a confidential conversation with her during the pauses in his song. At length Ogle heard his cheery voice singiDg a lively air as he entered his little room. Suddenly the song ceased, and a long whistle proceeded from Tom's lips. Whew! ' Oh, a life on the road for me ! With my brave and gallant steed ; A highwayman I wpuld be, Ogle knew that Tom was regarding his high wavman's costume. And I'll gallop along with speed.\" And so, Daisy, I'm to be a real highwayman at last! And you're quite willing to go with me, iass ? I thought so. I knew it without you telling me. \" Ogle ! Ogle !

Ogle was watching him, and a smile of undis guised admiration played upon his features a. he did so. \" ' With my coat so fine and my spurs so bright, I'll ride o'er the heath on a moonlight night' Eh ? What, Daisy ? What's up now ?\" These questions were caused by Daisy sud denly springing to her feet, and giving a snort of evident recognition to some person who stood just behind Tom. Tom turned quickly round, and beheld Felix Heron quietly contemplating him. \" So you are commencing your preparations, I see, Tom,\" said FeUx Heron kindly, as he placed his hand on the boy's shoulder. \" Yes, Captain. Why, you see, Daisy's trap pings have been a little neglected while I was a boarder and lodger of Jonathan WUd, so I just Tom was still busily engaged in arranging some rebellious locks beneath the hat, when Ogle laid his hand upon his shoulder, saying, \" Well, Tom, will the dress do ?\" Tom turned round, and clasped both Ogle's hands in his. - I knew it was you, Ogle!

Hurrah! Hurrah! I say, what time is it, Ogle ? It seems to me as if this day would never pass away ! What time is it ?\" \" Just eight o1clock,\" replied Ogle. ' \" WeU,\" said Tom, \" I shall begin to dress myself at once \u2014 it wUl take me at least two hours to get into all this grandeur ! Hip ! hip ! hurrah! Won't the girls be in love with me now, eh, Ogle ?\" Tom soon commenced the process of dressing, and he might be excused for the look of admira tion which sat upon his youthful face as he re garded himself in his little mirror. \" Bather the thing !\" said Tom, as he re arranged his black hair before placing the felt hat carefully upon his head. \" Yes, that'll do ! Now Daisy, my lass ! Off we go !\" Tom was not long leading Daisy from the stable, and in the court-yard he encountered Ogle. \" What can this mean ?\" said Tom to himself. \" Ho, Daisy ! \u2014 forward ! Forward, my lass !\" Tom dashed forward in the direction of tho sound. There was a turn in the road, and the moment Tom got past it he saw a chaise with the lamps alight in the middle of the road. Tom and Daisy were out of the line of light that the lamps cast around them ; but he could see, without being himself seen, a man standing up in the chaise, while a female form was crouching down in it. The man had the chaise whip in his hand, and was preparing to strike the female again. A flush of indignation came to Tom's face ; but for a moment he restrained himself, and waited to see what more would pass before he interfered with the cowardly villain who was thus ill-using a defenceless woman. \u00bb \" Oh, I saw you !\" roared the man. \" I saw you, madam, looking at that man on horseback, as we came through the New Boad ! I'll not have it \u2014 so take that !\" \" Upon my word, Tom,\" said Ogle, \" I scarcely knew you!\" \" Of course you didn't,\" said Tom, laughing merrily. \" I say, Ogle !\" \"Well, Tom?\" \"Where's the Captain?\" \" Here he is,\" 6aid Felix Heron, who had over heard Tom's question. \" I thought I should Uke to see how you looked, Tom.\" \" Thank you, Captain. I did not seem to Uke to go without seeing you, Captain. I fancy I shall have more luck now.\" \" Oh ! you are so jealous, George !\" said thi female in a gentle voice. \" You know I love you, and you only, and yet you treat me thus!' \" Don't tell me I am jealous !\" again shouted the man. \" Of course you'll say it's jealousy ; but I saw it with my own eyes, I tell you : ._ . I won't put up with it, so take that !\" \"Oh! George \u2014 George!\" sobbed the la ' female; \"you had much better get home with that large sum of money you have about you, than stop here to ill-use me on the high road !\" \" I think so, too !\" said Tom, to himself, as he dashed up to the side of the chaise with one bound. \" Good-bye, my boy,\" said Felix Heron as he grasped Tom's hand, \"and never forget that I am your debtor for life !\" There was a tremor in Felix Heron's voice, as he alluded to the service which Tom Eipon had done him in saving the life of his child, which for a moment checked Tom's hilarity. \" I'm coming, Daisy !\" shouted Tom, in order to hide the emotion which he felt on hearing Captain Heron thus allude to what he had done. \" I'm coming, my lass !\" And raising his hat, not ungracefully, to Felix Heron, he bounded into the court-yard again, and was soon mounted on the back of Daisy. The lady gave a scream, and the man with the whip turned in alarm to see who it was who so suddenly appeared by the side of the chaise, as though he had dropped from the clouds in order to interfere with his proceedings. \" Hold !\" cried Tom. \" Use that whip again, and it is at the peril of your life !\" \" And who may you be ?\" asked the man. \" That matters not,\" replied Tom ; \" but I will soon make you aware what you will be pretty quickly !\" As Tom spoke, he produced one of his pistols, and held it within three inches of the man's face.

Tom reined in Daisy, uncertain whether or not to proceed on the oourse he was, when his considerations were rather abruptly interrupted by the sound of carriage wheels and a loud voice exclaiming, \" Oh, there is no one here, madam, to pay any attention to you!

He had just time, however, to jerk the man's arm, and the bullet grazed Tom's cheek, and then buried itself in the trunk of a tree which stood close by. \" Villain !\" shouted Tom, \" you shall pay for that dastardly act !\" \" Oh, spare him \u2014 spare him !\" implored the lady. \" Do not kill him !\" \" I wUl not kill him, madam,\" said Tom, .' since you ask his worthless life ; but I will give him a lesson he shaU not forget in a hurry !\" \u2014 then turning to the man, who had sunk down in the chaise the personification of abject fear, he said, fiercely, \"Get out of the chaise, sir!\" The man sunk to his knees, and clasping his hands together, he said, \" I beg your pardon, kind sir ; and if you will forgive and for get \" \" SUence !\" shouted Tom. \" Get out of the chaise, I say, or I will drag you out !\" That one glance was sufficient to enable Tom to see that it was both young and fair, and that across one cheek there was a livid mark. \"How came that mark upon your face, madam ?\" asked Tom. \" Oh, do not ask me ! Suffice it to say that you have saved me from further ill-usage, and that you have my gratitude. FareweU !\" \" Are you this man's wife ?\" \"Alas, yes!\" sobbed a gentle voice, and again the lady buried her face in her handkerchief. \" Ah ! I thought as much !\" said Tom. \" Such a man would not dare to raise his hand against any other woman than the only one he was in duty bound to protect !\" Turning, then, again towards the man with a sudden fierceness which made him start, Tom cried out, \" Your money, villain ! \u2014 or your life and money both ! Quick! I will put up with no delay !\" \"Yes, certainly, my dear sir; you are quite welcome to every farthing I have about me !

Get out, or it may be worse for us, perhaps !\" Tom pretended not to have heard this admo nition given by the lady to her brutal husband, but reaching down from Daisy, opened the door of the chaise, saying as he did so, \" Take him out, Daisy !\" Daisy, at this order from Tom, took hold of the man by the back of the neck, and he would have been quickly removed from the chaise had not Tom again interposed. \"Quiet, Daisy \u2014 quiet, lass!\" In an instant the creature let go her hold ; and the man, seeing that there was no appeal to be made, prepared with a very bad grace to get out of the ehaise. Tom rattled the pistol on the side of the chaise. \" Be quick, sir,\" he said ; \" I give you only another minute !\" \" Yes, yes, if you please !

LADY CASTLENEAU MAKES A COURAGEOUS DE- TERMINATION. \" Let us know all,\" she said. \" I can well pre sume that there is, something upon your minds, which you hesitate to give utterance to.\" \" We do hesitate,\" said Colonel Trelawney, \" and yet it is necessary that we should make \u00bb. statement clearly and distinctly.\" \"Make it, then !\" cried Lady Castleneau. \" Wa not children, to be frightened at a shadow.\" \" Then I call upon our friend Bridgewater to make it, since from him I just heard it.\" \" I do not shrink,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater; \" and in answer to the observations which have been made by Lady Whitcombe, I may say that the reason put forth by Lord Clackington for asking th? King to confer on him the earldom of Whitcombe, consists of an allegation on his part that the\u2014 the \" Never in the history of his chequered existence had Felix Heron, Earl of Whitcombe, passed so complete a period of repose as that which had characterized his recent life. Many and anxious were the consultations he held with the Earl of Bridgewater, regarding the succession to his titles and estates of his son. And these consultations assumed a character of redoubled anxiety from a piece of intelligence which was brought to him by Colonel Trelawney. That intelligence was just this. The question of the succession to the title of Earl of Whitcombe was about to be complicated by the erection of a new Earldom of that name. My' Lord CJaekidgton, practising upon the weakness and vices of the monarch, had claimed, as a reward for all his past services, a step in the peerage. That step was to have the effect of creating him Earl of Whitcombe. \" Gracious heavens !\" exclaimed Lady Castle neau. \" What is the matter with my Lord Bridgewater? Has he lost his senses or his powers of speech ?\" \" Neither, my dear Lady Castleneau ; but I naturally shrink from saying a very disagreeable thing to a dear friend.1* \" Whatever it is, Bridgewater,\" said Heron, \" it wiU lose its sting by coming from your lips.\" \" Then,\" added the Earl, \" I wiU state that the legitimacy of your son is questioned.\" \"Indeed!\" How this was to be combated became the subject of a conference which took place at Whitcombe House, in the dusk of the evening ; and at which were present the Earl of Bridge water, Colonel Trelawney, the young Marquis of Ormond, and Lady Castleneau. Of course, Heron and Edith, as the principal personages concerned, listened and took part in all that occurred, with intense interest. Colonal Trelawney made his statement again -, and although he endeavoured to word it in such a manner that it should be in the least degree Defensive to the feelings of Edith or of Heron, yet there was much in it which could not fail to give them many a pang. . \" Yes. That is the ground upon which Lord Clackington goes. You are believed to be no more, and it is alleged that the marriage, if marriage there were, was of too informal a cha racter to entitle your son to claim either the name or honours of his father.\" \" Is that all ?\" cried Lady Casteneau, at the highest pitch of her voice. \" I only wish I had my Lord Clackington here ; I fancy I could alter his opinion.\" \" No, aunt,\" said Edith sadly, \" you would not alter his opinion ; for he cannot doubt the truth of my position or the legitimacy of my chUd, however it may suit his purposes to affect to do so !\" \u25a0 \" It is scarcely necessary,\" said the Colonel, \" that I should acquaint you with the name of my informant ; but upon the authenticity of my information you may rely ; and I can assure you, Whitcombe, that it is intended to bestow your honourable and ancient name, and title, upon one of the basest of men !\" \"Let me sp_ak, now,\" said Trelawney. \"I am quite convinced that such an allegation would not be put forward unless some means had been taken to carry it out; and you may depend, Whit combe, that unless you are in actual possession of clear and substantial proofs of your marriage, there wiU be the greatest difficulty in substantiat ing it.\" Both Heron's and Edith's thoughts flew back to that time of difficulty, trouble, and danger, when they became united in defiance of a thousand obstacles. The possibility Ukewise of all the substantial proofs of that union being obliterated, came but too clearly before their imaginations. \" This will never do,\" cried Heron; \" it seems to me, my good friends, that I shall have to come to life again, for the purpose of confounding this new iniquity.\" \"But will that answer the purpose?\" asked Bridgewater. \" Bather,\" cried Heron, \" ten times rather would I that the coronet of my earldom rested even upon the brow of Jonathan Wild, than that it should fall int o the possession of such a man as Clackington!\" \"Yes,\" added Colonel Trelawney; \"Clacking ton is the man ; aud I caU upon our mutual friend, Bridgewater, here, to confirm my statement.\" \" 1 can confirm it,\" said the young Earl of Bridgewater. \" But upon what pretence,\" exclaimed Edith, \" can this new earldom, upon an ancient title, be engrafted? Does the King and his CouncU for get that, although to all appearance, and in the world's estimation, my husband is no more, that I have a son who inherits his name and titles ?\" The Earl of Bridgewater and Colonel Tre lawney exchanged uneasy glances. The young Marquis of Ormond seemed afraid to meet the gaze of any one present. It was evident that some secret sat uneasUy upon the minds of all the gentlemen. \" Bather the reverse,\" said the young Marquis of Ormond. \" For it seems to me it would ou\\y compUcate the transaction.\""], [289, "283 EDITH IIERON. Lady Castleneau rose and advanced two steps towards the table in the centre of the room. \" The trouble would be nothing,\" replied Lady Castleneau ; \" and I particularly desire that this plan be left to me to carry out. Let me see, FeUx. What is the name of that boy you have in your household, who wanted to be a highway man?\" \" And all this trouble,\" she said, \" is to be taken and endured in ordei? -that my Lord Clack ington should receive the reward of an infamous life spent in crime and iniquity, at the hands of a Sovereign to whom he has been the basest of menials ?\" \" Tom Eipon : he not only wanted to be a highwayman, but is one.\" \" Then send him to me, and with his assist ance only I promise effectually to remove my Lord Clackington out of the way of being further troublesome.\" \" Aunt,'\" said Heron, with a smile, \" you call things by their right names, and I cannot help thinking, with all due deference to my friend Ormond, that I must re-appear again upon the busy scenes of life in my true character, and let Captain Fantome, of the royal navy, be for ever obliterated and forgotten.\" \"No,\" said Lady Castleneau; \"something better that, Felix^ can be done.\" The eyes of all present were turned towards the courageous old lady, who thus continued : \" Instead of Felix re-appearing, and exposing himself to the enmity and villany of those who we know seek his life, let the subject of this difficulty disappear.\" \" Disappear ?\" exclaimed Heron. \" Disappear ?\" cried the Earl of Bridgewater and Colonel Trelawney with one voice. \" Yes. Let my Lord Clackington disappear, and with him will likewise pass away his trouble some and pertinacious attempt upon the peerage of Whitcombe.\" \" Then,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater, \" our conference comes to an end. Of course you are aware, Whitcombe, that your half-brother, War ringdale, is intent upon the same project, but his chances of success are too slender to permit them to give you the slightest uneasiness.\" The party rose, and as the shadows of evening began to render objects in the room indistinct, they took leave of Heron and of Edith, leaving Lady Castleneau to make her own arrangements for the temporary seclusion of my Lord Clack ington. ' \" Let me see this Tom Eipon,\" said the old lady, \" and I will explain to him what I wish him to do.\" \" But, dear aunt,\" said Edith, \" are you not going to let us know exactly your course of pro ceedings?\" \" That is a bold measure, aunt,\" said Heron, with a smile. \" No, dear niece, I am not. I have read and heard quite enough regarding all such matters as these to feel convinced that the more one keeps one's own counsel the better. The best general is the one who has the fewest confidants; so let me alone, my dear, and you may depend I shall dis pose of my Lord Clackington.\" Tom Eipon was sent for, and made his appear ance in that drawing-room, with a very dubious expression of countenance. \" Not very ; but I think you misunderstand me. I do not mean to take the wretch's life, but to keep him somewhere in seclusion and in secrecy, until some change takes place that will render him harmless for further mischief.\" \" Good !\" cried the Earl of Bridgewater. \" In truth,\" said Colonel Trelawney, \" it might be done ; and as we all know the King's physi cians do not give him six months of life now, the plan approves itself to my mind each moment.\" Tom was afraid that some abrupt end was about to be brought to his experiences on the road, but he was speedily reassured by the first words of Lady Castleneau. \" l'om,\" she said, \" if you have no fear, and are in want of an adventure that may produce both profit and satisfaction, you must get iuto my coach, and come to my house at once.\" \"I'm your man, Lady Castleneau!\" said Tom. \" i suppose the Captain knows all about it ?\" \" Yes, Tom,\" said Heron; \"and I wish par ticularly that you should place yourself completely under the orders of Lady Castleneau.\" \"All's right ! Shall I take Daisy, Captain?\" \" No,\" interposed Lady Castleneau, \"there will be no occasion.\" \"Moreover,\" said Bridgewater, \"the heir to the throne, as we weU know, detests the very name of Clackington.\" They looked at each other then for a few seconds in silence, and then Colonel Trelawney held up his hand as he cried, \" Agreed ! I vote for the temporary suppression of my Lord Clack ir.gton, aud trust that we shaU be unanimous on that point.\" \"Agreed !\" cried everybody. \" Then I wiU set about it at once,\" said Lady Castleneau. \"You, aunt?\" \" And why not ? Do you think that I am so helpless and harmless that I cannot seize upon such a poor wretch as my Lord Clackington ? The only question is where to put him, even for the six months that the King's physicians think the present reign wUl last ?\" This was a question which no one seemed able to answer at the moment, and Lady Castleneau, after looking from one to the other for a few seconds in sUence, exclaimed, \" I see how it is. I must not only make this man a prisoner, but keep him too.\" The old lady consulted her watch, which was one of those huge old time-pieces weighing at least a pound, that were then thought quite wonders of the mechanical arts. \" Half-past eight,\" she said. \" I hope between this and midnight to have that wretched man, Clackington, in safe keeping. Come along, Tom, and don' tread on my skirts.\" Tom made a comical face to Edith and Heron as he foUowed Lady Castleneau from Whitcombe House. He would have got upon the coach-box alonn with old Anthony, or hung on behind that m_n derful vehicle which Lady Castleneau, in defiance of time and fashion, still used ; but as she had \" No, aunt, no !\" said Heron; \" that wUl never do. You would be involved in future trouble on his account.\""], [290, "284 EDITH HERON. her plan to explain to him, she insisted upon him riding inside. What that plan was we need not here detail, since, in its progress, it wUl sufficiently explain itself. Probably there was not another nobleman about the Court of St. James's who would have striven to place himself in possession of the dor mant peerage of Whitcombe, even if it had been proved to be so. And although vice had its votaries in those quarters as well as elsewhere, still the kind of natural odium which would attach to any man who would seek to make war against the rights of the widow and the fatherless, might weU cause even the most grasping and avaricious of the hangers on of royalty to hesitate before they would seek to arrogate to themselves the Earldom of Whitcombe. By niue o'clock the state of affairs at Castleneau House was just this. Lady Castleneau, stiU attired for the open air, i.ud with her hands reposing in a wonderful muff of enormous proportions, sat in that breakfast room with which the reader is so familiar. In the court-yard of the house was the car riage, with its two sleek, well-fed horses ; while old Anthony, wondering what bis mistress could be about to wish to go out at such a time of night, stood by their heads as if in deep consul tation with them. But my Lord Clackington had no such scru ples. And if, under ordinary circumstances, the slightest shadow of any such sensations had crossed his mind, his continued anger and rage. both at Edith and her husband, the deceased Earl, as he was supposed to be, would have overcome them. There is a foot upon the staircase of Castle l.eau House. There is a rustle of garments in its old haU. A faint scream, evidently in female tones, .makes Lady Castleneau impatient and a little angry. It was a kind of triumph over the dead that Lord Clackington looked to.' And, inasmuch as he could not fairly contend with, or overcome, the Earl of Whitcombe in life, he gloated over the idea of despoUing his wido w oi her fair fame, and his infant son of his name and his inheritance. She taps the floor impatiently with her foot. Tbe door of the breakfast-room is then opened, and Martha, with the corner of her apron stuffed into her mouth to suppress her laughter, enters, exclaiming, \" Here he is, my lady ! No, I mean here she is ! That is, I mean Tom Eipon, my l->dy! Here she is, if you please !\" What appeared to be a female form, attired in s very elegant dress of pale blue satin, sailed into the apartment, and executed such an elaborate curtsey, that it seemed impossible to conceive she would ever rise to the perpendicular again. 'Nousense! said Lady Castleneau; \"you must be perfectly serious.\" \" All's right !\" said Tom Eipon \u2014 for it was, indeed, none other than that personage, who was attired in the elegant satin dress, and whose hair had been frizzed and powdered by Martha untU he really resembled, as old Anthony afterwards remarked, a very fine young woman. \" Tom Eipon,\" said Lady Castleneau, with some severity of tone and manner. We shaU see how he fared. Probably my Lord Clackipgton was weU armed against any ordinary resistance. He expected remonstrances from the friends of Edith. Perhaps he expected a petition from the Coun tess of Whitcombe to the King. And, probably, in addition to that, he looked forward to no inconsiderable amount of public obUquy. , But for all that he was prepared. The prize he wished to grasp seemed to him to be well worth all these considerations. But in his most discursive dreams upon the subject, he never contemplated such an action as that which had been advised by Lady Castleneau, and which we now see she was prepared, with her usual energy, to carry out. \" Now, Tom !\" said the old lady ; \" foUow me. and be discreet. \" Yes, my lady.\" \"EecoUect that upon the expedition we are going, the less you say the better ; and we must have no levity whatever.\" \"All's right!\" said Tom. \" I have my pistols with me, and I'm going to carry them in this little bit of a bag that Martha caUs a ridicule .'\" \" Which I suppose is a reticule,\" said Lady Castleneau. \" I, too, will go armed, for it may be quite necessary to frighten that wretched old sinuer within an inch of his life.\" \" I mean to,\" said Tom. \" Some young women are a disgrace to their sex ; but I shall set a public example.\" \" The first effort in that direction,\" said Lady Castleneau, rather curtly, \"should be to keep sUent.\" \" AU's right, my lady !\" said Tom. Tom Eipon gallantly offered his arm to old Lady Castleneau ; but she declined it, informing him that that was not the way to keep up his supposed character. \" You look the young gentlewoman well enough,\" she said ; \" but the slightest indiscretion would betray you ; and recoUect, that upon the proceedings of this night probably depend the peace and happiness of those who, I believe, are very dear to you.\" These words had a great effect upon Tom Eipon. The kind of levity of air and demeanour that had come over him since he had been attired by Martha in female apparel, subsided at once- CHAPTEE CCLSSV. latiy castleneau and tom rd?on proceed to st. james's palace. All the passive resistance in the world, and all the remonstrances against the perpetration of such a piece of iniquity contemplated by my Lord Clackington, could not have produced a hun dredth part of the effect which these energetic proceedings of Lady Castleneau certainly pro mised."], [291, "285 EDITH HEROS. \u2022 Lady Castleneau felt that at all events she had secured one aUy who would be quite ready to do her any service ; and however obscure he might be, there was no teUing how useful the good opinion of such a man as that even might be in an emergency. Anthony alighted and knocked at the door in dicated by the soldier. The demand for admission was answered by one of the Yeomen of the Guard, who evidently looked with intense surprise at the extmordinaiy cquipage that was drawn up in the court-yr.rd. \"My mistress would speak to you,\" said Anthony. \"Who is she? A lady?\" \" What else should she be ?\" \" Lady Castleneau.\" he said ; \" you may de pend upon me. I may be a wild sort of fellow at times, but when there really is anything serious to be done, I can look as grave, and be as sik-nt. as any of those old owls in Epping Forest, tiat used to stare at us all when we were going out on an expedition with the Captain, and then sit on the stump of a tree aU the night long, asking no questions, but, no doubt, wondering who we were, and what we were about.\" \" Come on, then !\" said Lady Castleneau ; \" I feel assured that I can trust you.\" The court-yard was reached, and old Anthony, as usual, assisted his mistress into the antiquated coach. Tom followed, looking as demure as possible, and only replying to Anthony's blank stare of astonishment by the slightest possible wink, and a kick, which made the old man jump again. \" Good gracious !\" muttered Anthony ; \" what's g_iog to happen now?\" \" To St. James's Palace !\" said Lady Cas tieneau. \" But I mean title \u2014 title ?\" \" Certainly, a lady.\" \" AU's right.\" The Yeoman stepped to the door of the car riage, and, glancing into it, he exclaimed, iu a mysterious tone of voice, \" Clyteranestra!\" \"What?\" exclaimed Ladv Castleneau. \"Media!\" \"Eh?\" exclaimed Lady Castleneau again. The Yeoman of the Guard and the occupants of the carriage now gazed at each in silence for a few seconds, which was interrupted by Tom's natural loquacity, which could be kept quiet no longer. \" What do you mean?\" said Tom, speaking in an affected falsetto voice, \u2014 \" what do you mean by calling us such names ? I believe you're a gay deceiver; and as a respectable young woman, I beg you wUl keep your distance, you mis leader.\" \" Yes, my lady.\" The old sleek horses were set in motion, and through the now tolerably crowded streets \u2014 for it w\u00e6 that time in the evening when a number of persons were returning to their homes \u2014 the ancient vehicle made its way to the Court end of the town. Upon reaching the gateway of the Palace, the carriage was btopped, since none but known. visitors and members of the household were per mitted to drive into the Colour Court. .Lady Castleneau spoke from the window of the vehicle. \" I wish to see my Lord Clackington,\" she said ; \"and I have an appointment with him .of importance. \" The name of Clackington was too well known as that of trje King's prime favourite, for it to be otherwise than a good passport of admission to ot. James's. \" That's it,\" said tho Yeoman. \" That'll do.\" \" What'll do ?\" said Tom. \" Why, marm, you might a% well have said it at once !\" M Said what at onco?\" asked Lady Castleneau, with some impatience. \" Why, marm,\" said the Yeoman, \" if tho young lady had said sho was Miss Leda at once, I should have known all about it, for that's one of 'em. And if the young lady will be so good as to alight and follow me, I shall be very happy to lead the way.\" \" What does it all mean?\" whispered Tom to Lady Castleneau. \" I never said I was Miss anybody.\" \" Hush ! it's the man's mistake.\" After a little hesitation, the carriage was allowed to proceed, and it rattled over those old stones, on which so many illustrious feet have trod, into the Colour Court. A couple of dim oil lamps lighted this court, Oi\", rather, made darkness visible within it. A soldier off duty, however, had been sent from the guard-room with a lantern, and mar shalled the way for Anthony. He directed him to puU up his horses at a particular doorway ; and then, informing him gruffly that there he would hear of my Lord Clackington, he made a surly kind of salutation to Lady Castleneau, .nd was about to leave. \" Bather !\" \" Don't alight\" \" I don't mean.\" \" Now, miss, if you please,\" added the Yeo man. \" His lordship is in the Yellow Cabinet, and a certain person is at supper.\" \"Get out!\" said Tom. \"What do I care about your certain person and yellow cabiuets ? I want to see my Lord Clackington . And all you've got to do, my good man, is to go and tell him that a young, tender, and delicate female, subject to kicking hysterics if sbe don't have her own way, is waiting iu the court-yaid to see him.\" \"Stop!\" said Lady Castleneau; \"we never nllow any one to do us a service without being paid for it.\" The soldier looked perfectly astonished at the guinea which Lady Castleneau placed in his fiand. He paused, as if expecting some extra service would be required of him for so large a pay ment. \" H you wish,\" said Lady Castleneau, \" to do us more service, you will probably be at the gate as. wo leave the Palace?\" \" That will I, marm, if you should be haU the night before you do so !\" The Yeoman shook his head. \" His lordship never comes out , and as you are one of them, Miss Leda, you ought to have known that.\" \" Tom!\" whispered Lady Castleneau."], [292, "286 EDITH HERON. \" Yes, my lady.\" \" You will have to go. I trust aU to your discretion. You must see my Lord Clackington, and, upon one pretext or another, get him to come down here and step into the coach.\" \"Very good,\" said Tom, \"I'll try it ; and if he won't come in a proper way, I'll carry him.\" \" Now, miss, if you please,\" said the Yeoman ; \" are you coming ?\" \"I am,\" said Tom; \"but it's a very hard thing that a delicate young female should ask for a gentleman to come out to her coach, and be told he won't.\" \"I have a good mind to scream,\" said Tom; \" and I'U tell my mother, as sure as you're born!\" \"Go to the deuce!\" cried the Yeoman. \"I believe you're mad ; and I'm only sorry I let you in at all !\" \"Men,\" said Tom, \" were deceivers ever ; hut I didn't come here to be made game of by a low fellow Uke you !\" \" I won't go any further,\" said the Yeoman ; \" You may find your own way, and 'be hanged !\" \"Be off, then!\" said Tom. \"And the next time you have a delicate young lady to show up a staircase, don't be tumbling about and pretending to be drunk. Take that, and be off ! Nervous and delicate as I am, too !\" \" That's not my business, miss,\" said the Yeo man ; \" only I know he never does come out. Allow me to assist you.\" \" Thank you,\" said Tom, as he alighted from the carriage, taking care to come with all tbe weight he could upon the Yeoman's toes ; and then, pretending to trip a little, Tom thrust his elbow into the stomach of the Yeoman with such force, that the man was nearly doubled up with the concussion. The kick with which Tom accelerated the movements of the Yeoman was so heartily be stowed, that he made but one flying leap down the whole flight of stairs into the corridor below. \" \"Well,\" said Tom, as he re-arranged his some what disordered apparel, \u2014 \" I think, if Lady Castleneau had seen all this, she would have been quite delighted at my supporting the charactei so well. Any other fellow, now, might have walked in looking as demure as a cat, but that wouldn't have answered a bit, and I dare say that fellow thinks I'm a girl of spirit. I wonder where I am now?\" \" Dear me !\" said Tom ; \" mind what you're about! Is this the way to treat a female in her teens ?\" \" I don't know !\" growled the Yeoman; \"but my toes are smashed, and I haven't a bit of breath left in me !\" \" Then you should be more careful and con siderate, you horrid earthen jar I\" said Tom. 11 Earthen jar !\" exclaimed the Yeoman. \" Yes. A fair young being hke me is a real chany tea-cup \u2014 delicate as a piece of tissue paper, and as pretty as puff-paste; but wretches iike you are nothing but common earthenware !\" \" Well, it may be so, \" said the Yeoman ; llbut the chany tea-cup has got a d6iico of a. point to its elbow !\" Tom pushed open a door very handsomely covered with crimson velvet, and studded with a profusion of gilt nails. It led him into a picture gallery, whe_t_ hung portraits of many of the monarchs of England, and various members of their families. The gallery was lit by lamps held in the hands of marble statues, and it was quite evident from the rich carpeting that was laid upon the floor that it formed one of the royal thoroughfares within the ancient building. But as Tom saw no one, and did not know very well which way to go in order to find Lord Clackington, lie began to regret having knocked the Yeoman down stairs, and to debate in his own mind the proprioty of seeking that individual again. A sow seconds, however, put an end to this perplexity, for Tom saw approaching him from the further end of the gallery r\u00bb rather richly dressed personage, with a bow of ribbon on each shoulder, and who walked in a manner which seemed to indicate that if St. James's Palace and all its dependencies did not actually belong to him, they ought in hie estimation to do so. \" I wonder who this is?\" thought Tom ; \"and what I ought to say and do now ? However, I think I can hold my own ; and if the worst comes to the worst, I can fight him and defend my virtue.\" \"Lead the way, fellow,\" added Tom. \"I wouldn't have you come behind me on any ac count. You'd have you're hoofs on my skirt every moment. There, now, go on!\" The Yeoman preceded Tom into the Palace, muttering to himself some not very comp'i meutary expressions in regard to Miss Leda. Tom thought he waa playing his part to per fection; but it will be seen that his notions of the habits and behaviour of young ladies in general were rather crude. The Yeoman led the way across a small cor ridor, and up a staircase very thickly carpeted. The stairs, however, were rather steep; and Tom was not in the habit of ascending any steps whatever, steep or shallow, in female cos tume. The consequence was, thai, he slipped twice or thrice, and each time made such a grasp at the Yeoman, that he nearly brought him down the whole flight. 11 Good gracious !\" ejaculated the Yeoman ; \" whenever shall I get rid of this dreadful young person ?\" \" There you go again !\" said Tom, as he^, slipped again for the fourth time, just at the head of the stairs. CHAFTEli CCLXXVL This time, the tug that Tom gave to the Yeo man's coat fairly overthrow him; and Miss Leda, as he supposed, scrambled over him with out the least ceremony, and leaped on &o the ianding.

The personage with the shoulder knot made a low bow to Tom Ki^oo. which bp returned with"], [293, "287 EDITH m__ou. _ court\u00bb\u00aby so profound that Tom had the greatest difficulty in recovering his balance again, and rising to his feet. This elegant solution of Tom's seemed to make a great impression upon the gentleman with the bows upon his shoulders, lor he advanced sis steps something after the fashion of a dancing master, and placing his hand upon his heart, he executed another bow considerably lower than the former. \" Well,\" said Tom, \" I've got his watch, and if all's gold that glitters, it's a good one. What a fine long chain too, and a bunch of seals at the end of it ! Well, it wouldn't do to come here for nothing; but I wonder what I'm to do next? I suppose some of these doors lead somewhere. I'll try this one.\" About half-way down the gallery a very elegantly ornamented door presented itself, and Tom was on the point of opening it, when he re collected that wound round the pretty fanciful bat he wore was a gauzy kind of veil of the palest possible pink. Tom Eipon had advanced about the same distance, so that they were now tolerably close to each other. \" May I,\" said the gentleman with the shoulder knots, .\" take the liberty of inquiring to whom I have the honour of addressing myself?\" \" Certainly not !\" said Tom. \"I don't permit any liberties.\" This veil Tom drew over his face, aud tied in a coquettish manner under his chin. He then opened the door, and he did so with his usual abruptness, and perhaps a little more than usual, for there seemed a kind of opposition to his doing so, which he had to exert some force to overcome. \" Eh ?\" \"And, if it comes to making inquiries, who may you be, old pump ?\" \"What?\" It did not strike Tom Ripon that this opposition arose from the fact of some one opening the door at the same time from the inner side. \" I ask you who you are? Can't you answer a plain question ?\" \" I have the honour to be Sir Adolphus Jingle.\" \" You look it !\" said Tom. But such was exactly the state of affairs. The personage, whoever he was, ran full against Tom, and Tom ran full against the personage. It probably was but an accident, but Tom thought the personage kicked rather unmercifully, and he retaliated with such interest that the per sonage uttered a yell cf pain. \" Madam !\" \" Don't madam me, old Jingle ! Cant you say what you want at once, or I'll scream and raise the house.\" Tom, then, in the confusion of the moment, saw nothing but a very elaborately curled and powdered wig bobbing about in confusion before his face. \" Scream ?\" \" Certainly. Why not ? What else can we delicate females do to protect ourselves from wolves in sheep's clothing, and with bows on their Bhoulders ?\" To seize it, and fling it to the other end of the apartment into which that door opened, was the work of a moment to Tom ; and then a voice yelled lustily, \" Murder ! murder ! help !\" \"Guard! treason!\" shouted an.ther voice; and a door at the further end of that first room was opened, at which a gentleman appeared with a drawn sword in his hand, and shaking from top to toe with the direst apprehensions. \" But, madam, I have done nothing.\" ' \" I know that as well as you, old Jingle, but you wanted to kiss me, and I won't have it.' \" I, madam ?\" \"Yes\u2014you, to be sure.

And this is royal taste, too !\" '\u2022Be off with you!',' cried Tom; \"and don't This gentlemen was attired iu a plain brown suit of half-worn-out velvet. His countenance was long and cadaverous, and the only thing noticeable about him was a star upon his breast of the purest and most sparkling brilliants. There was plenty of light in the gallery. There was more light still in thc room iu which Tom had intruded. And through the open doorway of the apart ment from which the gentleman with the star had just emerged, there came still more light. The richness of the furnishings of these apartments, and the general style of costly de coration that met Tom's eyes as he gazed about him, convinced him that he had reached some of the rooms specially in the occupation of royalty. \" Good heavens, my Lord Clackington !\" cried be netting your stupid old head into trouble. I'll ' the gentleman with the star ; \" what is the mean telf of you, I will. You first of all want to kiss j ing of this unseemly uproar ?\" \" Craving your Majesty s pardon,\" said the bewildered Lord Clackington, as he looked gloomily about him for his wig, \u2014 \"craving yo.-.r Majesty's pardon, I have not the slightest idea.\" me, and then you abuse liis most gracious Majesty. Be off with you, do !\"' The groom in waiting was only too glad to be off, and rushed down the staircase, muttering some expressions that were anything in the world but complimentary to the supposed Miss j_e_a. \" You never had,\" said Tom. \" Audacious!\" 6aid the King, for it was no_o"], [294, "288 E_.ru n_Roy \u2022jlliai. \" Who and what ;.re you, and how came (i si hither.?\" the most violent piece of goods I ever saw in my life.\" \" Ah !\" cried Clackington ; \" I guess.\" He darted forward to th-. King, and whispered Lord Clackington was thoroughly bewildered ; arid when Tom released him he made a rush into tl.e supper room, with a total disregard of all eti quette, and uttering some expressions which the King found it politic and prudent to seem not to hear. something. \"Indeed!\" was the reply. \" Yes, your Majesty ; so entirely unsophisti cated, as I remarked.\" \" Ah, ah ! Something fresh ! Weil, my Lord Clackington, we have had sophisticated ladies of this school enough.\" - What do you mean,\" said Tom, \" going on about fisty-cuffs in that way ? If you want to _a;ht, come on !\" \" This is inderd original,\" said the King. \" She seems a fine yout.g woman.\" \" A remarkably fine young woman, your Ma jesty,\" added Lord Clackington ; \" although I must confess her conduct now perfectly puzzles -Tie, for Mrs. Marables reported her only fault to her excessive bashfulness.\" But his Majesty had evidently great expecta tions of the beauty of Miss Leda ; and holding Tom by the hand, he led him with a smirking sort of gallantry into the adjoining room, where an elegant repast for two persons only was laid on a small oval table. The dishes and covers were of gold, and the spoons and forks of the same costly metal, while the richness of all the appurtenances of the table was such as to dazzle and confound any imagina tion not accustomed to such costly details. \" Pray be stated, \" said ihe KiDg, \" and let me again entreat you to remove that envious screen, which, I am - quite certain, hides so much beauty ?\" \" Not yet,\" said Tom. \" I'm afraid I'm being deceived. I shall be taken in and done for, if I don't look sharp \u2014 what's that?\" Tom directed his eyes, with a frightened look. up to the ceiling. Both Lord Clackington and the King followed his example, and during the temporary and mys tified examination of a painting, which adorned the ceiling, Tom managed to pocket three table spoons and two forks. '\u2022 Indeed !\" \" Yes, your Majesty, and if such a thing were possible with one so young, I could almost mingine she was under the influence of some viu ius excitement. Oh, there's my wig ! Your Majesty has your royal foot upon it.\" \" You'd better say I'm drunk at once,\" said Tom. \" It's hard, it's hard indeed to be abused and called all manner of names by a wretched old reprobate like that. Let me get at him ! I'm long-suffering, but when I'm once roused, I can take wy own part, and I've much need to do so. My mother brought me up with much tenderness and care, and she used to say, 'Juliana, my tender and delicate dove, if any one insults you, give him one in the eye !' \" -Hold, hold!\" cried the King. \"This has gone far enough !\" \" Do you think so?\" said Tom. \" We have said it. My Lord Clackington may h.ive erred in his over-zeal in my service. For give him \u2014 let it pass.\" \" I don't bear malice,\" said Tom. \" Put on \" I see nothing unusual,\" said the King. \" Nor I, either,\" said Clackington. '\u25a0 No more do __,\" said Tom. \" But lor' ! its getting late.\" \"By no means!\" cried the King. \"And. besides, time is of no account within the;.'. walls.\" \"You don't say so? Bless us! what a pretty watch !\" Tom adroitly whipped the King's watch out of his pocket, and put it to his ear. \"It's going,\" he said. \" I hope so,\" ffiid the King. \"You're right, then,\" said Tom; \"for it's gone !\" A he spoke, he put the watch into the bosom of his dress. your wig, old 'un.\" \u25a0\u25a0 And you remove your veil,\" added the King; iiii report oalls you charming.\" - Wait a bit,\" said Tom. \" I feel all of a diister with the conduct of that man \u2014 or rather that baboon, I should say, in the shape of a man ; <nd the only thing that will reconcile me to him -., ould be his coming down to the court-yard at once, and apologizing to my second aunt's .io. iter's sister, who is waiting for me below.\" \u2022' 'Veil, well,\" said the King, \" ho shall apolo jrizi\"\u2014he shall apologize; but at present, my dear gill, let mo invite you to a little repast wliich is }\u25a0\u25a0 I in the adjoining chamber. Pray take my hand.\" The King looked a little chagrined, which Lord Clackington observing, induced him to say, \"Miss Leda, I am sure, is only jesting. and \" \"Take that!\" said Tom; \"and speak when you're spoken to !\" A gold soup-ladle came with such force upon thc head of Lord Clackington, that the sound was quite alarming. \" La ! your Majesty,\" said Tom ; \" how pre oijiitate you are!\" - This way \u2014 this way. Come, my Lord i 'lackingtonj let bygones be bygones. We have no attendants but yourself on this auspicious evening, for we have dismissed Sir Adolphus . I ingle from further waiting until to-morrow.\" \"And look sharp!\" said Tom, as he seized lead Clackington by the back of the neck, and \u25a0in fe him a shake that nearly lifted him off his !<\u2022<'_. \" Really ! really !\" cried the King, \"this is too much! You are reckless, my dear Miss Leda There will be some mischief done.\" \" Only a little bump,\" said Tom, as he looked at the bowl of the ladle, which was slightly in dented. The Palace clock at that moment struck the hour of eleven. Tom Bipon uttered two vigorous screams. \"Gracious heavens!\" cried the King; \" what's the matter?\" \"T.ashfnl indeed!\" muttered the King; \"she's \"My aunt's sister's second cousin's wife!\""], [295, "EDITH HERON. 283 'Who?\" \"Juliana Matilda Mary Ann Emily Jane, if \" Down in the court below. I forgot her.\" \" Oh, heed her not \u2014 heed her not.\" \"But I must tell her. Oh, you wicked men! if I'm to stay here and have some supper, I must tell her.

She won't go till 6he sees me, and then not for nothing. Stop ! I have it ! I have it ! The old woman is mercenary. We must give her something to go away. Let's see \u2014 these plates and dishes \" \"Stop \u2014 stop !\" cried the King. \" This cruet-stand.\" \" Certainly, if you please. But why are you holding one of the dish-covers over your face ?\" \"To hide my blushes,\" said Tom; \"but I'm better now.\" Tom put the dish-cover upon Lord Clacking ton's head, apparently in a moment of abstrac tion. \" Well well,\" said the King; \"we will see to ill that \u2014 we will see to all that, Juliana, I think you said your name was ?\" JJo. 89.\u2014 Edith Heeos. \"Hold! hold!\" \" This star.\" Tom made a grasp at the brilliant decoration on the breast of the King."], [296, "290 EDITH HERON. \" Come,\" said Tom, \" you must just say a word or two to assure my female relative that all is well, and I can give her the money.\" Tom opened the coach door, and still holding Lord Clackington by the arm, he adroitly leaped into the vehicle. \" Are you mad ? Do you think that wholesale robbery is to take place in this fashion ? I am quite willing that the person you named should be rewarded, but it must be done with some sort of discretion. My Lord Clackington, I leave this business to yon. Go to the court-yard and despatch it, and then return to us, for we shall require these covers removed, and your attend ance at supper.\" \" I obey your Majesty's orders.\" \" Stop,\" said Tom. \" Your Majesty don't know her, or you would never suppose she would go away for anything my Lord \"Clacking ton could say to her. I must go myself, or she will create a riot and a scandal in the court-yard of the Palace.\" \" Now, my lord,\" he said, as he reached out his other hand, and caught the elderly nobleman by the collar, \" you will be so good as to step in here, and if you utter half a word above your breath, I will blow your brains out with as little compunction as T would those of a mad dog !\" \"Mur \" \" Hush ! Your life is in ycmr own hands !\" By a vigorous effort, Tom dragged Lord Clackington into the coach ; and then placing over his head and face the reticule he had brought from Castleneau House, he tied the strings rather tightly round his neck, and to Lord Clackington all was darkness, danger, and terror. \" But how can I be sure of your return ?\" re marked the King. \" My Lord Claokington will go with me. and, if needs be, bring me back by force, although that will not be needed.\" Tom Kipon, as he spoke, gave the King a sudden dig about the region of the ribs which nearly deprived him of breath. \" Gracious heavens ! don't do that ! And this,\" added the King to himself, \"is the modest young creature whose bashfulness was considered her only drawback ! Go, my Lord Clackington, \u2014 pray accompany tins young lady to that terribly complicated female relative who is below ! Give her this purse, and tell her she may call for her niece, or forty-fourth cousin, whatever their rela tionship may be, in the morning !\" \" I'll carry the purse,\" said Tom, as he inter cepted it before Lord Clackington could reach out his hand to receive it. \" Now, come along, and mind you behave yourself ! .I'm afraid this is a bad place for a tender, young, delicate crea ture, still in her teens, to come to ; but if you say half a word to me, I'll knock all your teeth down your throat, and scalp you !\" \" She's a perfect virago,\" whispered Lord Clackington to the King. \" But. you reported her as the mirror of modesty and bashfulness!\" CHAPTEB CCLXXVII. TOM EIPON PAYS ANOTHER VISIT TO WAP.DOUR STREET. The capture of Lord Clackington had occupied so short a space of time, that, in the dim light of the Colour Court, he had not observed the ap pearance of the vehicle into which he had been hustled and dragged. Lady Castleneau had not uttered a word, therefore he had no means of identifying her with the transaction. Tom Ripon, however, spoke in his own voice now, as he gave Lord Clackington a slight tap on the head with the ban .1 of a pistol. \" Do you know what that is ?\" said Tom. \"Meroy, no !\" \" It's a pistol, well loaded and carefully primed. Silence is nccess .ry, and if you break it, any further noise is of little impn-tance. Therefore, I shall fire, and make an end of my Lord Clackington.\" ' I am silent. Spare my life \u2014 that is all I ask.\" \" I was deceived, your Majesty !\" \" You are a fool, my Lord Clackington \u2014 an idiot!\" \" I have the honour to be anything your Majesty pleases !\" \"Go \u2014 go! Dismiss the female relative, and bring the girl back again ! I long to see her face, since you have praised her beauty to the very echo !\" \" And a great deal, too,\" said Tom. \" Hush ! Sit there!\" Tom thrust Lord Clackington into a corner of the carrirge, on the opposite seat to that occu pied by himself and Lady Castleneau. Old Anthony had previously had his instruc tions, and now he put his horses in motion to leave the court-yard of the Palace. A feeling of desperation must have come ovor Lord Clackington at this moment, and even the dread of death did not overcome it. \" Come on, old 'un !\" said Tom. As he spoke, he seized Lord Clackington's arm, and pulling it under his own, he dragged him out into the gallery, whither they were both followed by the wondering eyes of the King, who began to doubt, after all, whether it would be prudent to wait for the return of so violent and precarious a personage as Miss Leda. Tom took care not to release my Lord Clack ington for a moment ; and even when the stair case wa6 reached, he managed to drag the half scared old nobleman down the steps by his side. That confidential Yeoman of the Guard was still there on duty. Seeing Lord Clackington, he officiously opened the door which led into the Colour Co-n ... There stood the carriage of Lady Ca. tleueau. The idea of being carried away by persons he knew not, and he could not guess whither, pro duced such a feeling of despair, that even at a risk of Ja realization of those threats that hud been held out to him, he could not refrain from calling for help as the carriage was about to roll under the archway at the Palace gate. \" Halt !\" cried the sentinel ou dutv. \" What is that ?\" Tom Kipon thought for a momeut all was lost. Lady Castleneau laid her hand upon his arm."], [297, "291 EDITH HERON. Lady Castleneau, in the same low tones in which she had been speaking, \" and follow me.\" Tom took a firm grasp of Lord Clackington by the collar, and helped him out of the vehicle. \" May I speak \u2014 may I speak ? Let mo speak !\" moaned Clackington. \" Don't speak !\" she whispered ; \" leave me to manage this.\" \" It is I,\" she said, as 6he looked from the car riage window. \" Where is the man who kindly showed me to the Colour Court ?'' \" Another guinea, by Jove !\" cried a voice. \" It's all right, sentry ; this is a most respectable lady, and a friend of his Majesty's.\" \" But it is too late,\" added the sentinel, per tinaciously, \u2014 \"it is too late without the night pass-word.\" \" Why, she told it you, didn't she ? Bruns wick \u2014 didn't she tell it you ?\" \" Certainly,\" said Lady Castleneau, \u2014 \" Bruns wick.\" \" If you cut it short,\" said Tom, \" you may. What is it V\" \" I will give a hundred guineas for my liberty.\" \" What do you say ?\" cried Tom, addressing an imaginary personage, \u2014 \" what do you say, Captain ? He offers a hunched thousand guineas for his liberty.\" Tom then answered himself by speaking through his doubled hand, in the form of a trumpet, in growling accents, \" Not for a mil lion.\" The sentinel was rather confused, and scarcely liked to take upon himself to say that the pass word had not been properly given. Another guinea was dropped into the willing palm of the corporal who had made so good a night's work by unconsciously assisting Lady Castleneau in an adventure which had much more important results than ho anticipated, and for which assistance, had he but known its value, he might have received a m\"ch larger sum. Lord Clackington gave himself up for lost, and with a shambling gait, allowed Tom to lead him across the court-yard, and up the steps of Castleneau House. Lady Castleneau herself led the way, and on the topmost storey of the mansion a small room . was opened, which was sufficiently well lighted, although only by a skylight, so that my Lord Clackington could make no observation of his whereabouts, unless such information could be derived from the flying clouds or the blue sky to be seen through the skylight. Tom Eipon then spoke : \" My Lord Clacking- ton, it has been determined to he necessary that you should be out of the way for a time. Some people thought that the best way would be to put you under ground ; but others, more merciful, suggested that you be made a prisoner. IS, however, you would rather go out of the world altogether than out of it in this kind of way, you've only to say so, and you can be in- dulged.\" \"No, no \u2014 life!\" cried Lord Clackington ; \"at least let me have life, for while there is life there is hope.\" The Palace was left. Lord Clackington had made hi\u00bb lost effort at freedom, and now he sank back in the corner of the coach in a state of absolute despair. It was half-past eleven o'clock, and no doubt the old, pampered horses in Lady Castleneau's coaeh were anxious enough to get home, and as the distance from St. James's to Bloomsbury was but short, Tom Kipon salty expected to arrive there in the course of the next twenty minutes. But Lady Castleneau was conducting the whole affair with an amount of finesse that Tom had no conception of. In pursuance of his instructions, old Anthony certainly drove to Bloomsbury, but instead of proceeding direct to Castleneau House, he as tonished the horses and Tom Ripon by going up and down all the new bye-roads in the neigh bourhood. \" Agreed,\" said Tom ; \" but I warn you that any attempt to escape will be visited upon you with certain death.\" He drove right through the narrow lane that led to the fields at Camden Town, aud then back again past the mansion and grounds of Lord Mornington. For a short distance, likewise, on to the stony way of Tottenham Court Road was the carriage driven ; and in this way, although the distance from Castleneau House never exceeded half a mile, a whole hour was consumed in driving round about the neighbourhood. \"You understand,\" whispered Lady Castle neau to Tom Ripon, \u2014 -you understand now that the impression on the mind of Lord Clack ington will be that he is taken some miles into the country, and made a prisoner in some old house, from which there will be no chance of escape, or of succour coming to him.\" \" Good !\" said Tom. \" That's the right way to do it, but I must own I didn't think of such a \" Tell me, then,\" said Clackington, in a dreaiy tone of voice, \u2014 \" tell me what is the motive of my imprisonment. What have I done to you, whoever you are, or to anybody else, that I should be captured in this fashion ? Who and what are you? You cannot be the Miss Leda expected at the Palace, for it is not your interest to behave in this way.\" \" It's best to ask no questions,\" said Tom. As he spoke, Tom closed the door of Lord Clackington's prison, and turned the key in the lock. \" There he is, all right, my lady ; and now I'll go and tell the Captain and Lady Edith what has happened. But, after all, I think it'll be best to hang him, for he will be no end of trouble.\" \" Leave that to me, Tom Ripon,\" said Lady Castleneau. \" We have secured him, and put an end to that one complexity which, perhaps, might have caused Felix to discover his con tinued existence to his enemies. This wicked old man shall not escape from his imprisonment while the present King sits upon the throne of England.\" dodge.\" Lady Castleneau now touched the check string that was round the wrist of old Anthony, and that was the agreed upon signal at which he was to drive into the court-yard of Castle neau House. \" Xou will brisg the prisoner along,\" said"], [298, "292 EDITH HERON- I \"Hold your braying !\" cried Tom again. \"I want to listen.\" \\ \" And yea, a dance.\" \" I tell you what it is, Mortification ; there shall be, yea, a broken head if you don't be quiet.\" Tom departed from Castleneau House exceed- ingly well pleased with the night's adventure. But before he proceeded to St. James's Street, to give an account of what had taken place to Felix Heron and to Edith, Tom thought it pru dent to get rid of the little plunder he had brought with him from the Palace. He accordingly bent his steps towards War dour Street, and a little after midnight was rap ping at the shutters of his mother's house, in that peculiar manner which was sufficient to in dicate to her and to Mortification that a customer was at hand. \" Yea, a fatted calf with onions.\" The next utterance of Mortification consisted of a shout of dismay, for Tom Ripon, turning on the threshold of the back room, tired both his pistols right into the shop. The flashes lit up the dingy place for a seoond, and exhibited unmistakably a man seated on the counter, and swinging his legs to and fro with all the unconcern imaginable. \" I knew it,\" cried Tom. \" Mr. Wild, what do you want here? But it's come to this, you or I must be a dead man to-night.\" \" Take things easy,\" said Wild, as he undid the slide of the dark lantern, and held it out at arm's length,\u2014\" take things easy, Tom Eipon. I admire you very much, and knowing that you would be sure to come here to-night, I was de termined to tell you so. Let bygones be by gones. I promise you three years from this date, and I'm sure I shall not lose by leaving it to your generosity to pay me well for my for bearance. Mortification, what's for supper?\" The opening at the top of the shop door was again resorted to as usual by Mortification as a point from which he could reconnoitre the visi tor. \" Open \u2014 open, old boy !\" cried Ton\\ \"Yea, it is Thomas! Yea, the prodigal re turneth ! Is it spoons, Thomas, or what ?\" \" Don't be stupid,\" said Tom ; \"but let me in at once. I've been having supper with the King, and he's made me a present of some gold spoons and forks.\" Mortification was so astonished at this state ment from Tom Kipon, that he made a false step on the three-legged stool he stood upon behind the door, and came down to the passage with a rattle and a dash that made Tom wonder what had happened. Tom was perfectly staggered and surprised at this cool behaviour on the part of Jonathan Wild. Then Mrs. Ripon's voice could be heard in quiring the cause of the uproar; and, as Tom began to amuse himself by flinging some of the royal spoons through the fanlight, Mrs. Ripon began to think the house was besieged. But Tom's voice quickly reassured her. \" Open ! open !\" he cried. \" Am I to stand here all night, with no end of swag?\" \" Gracious providence, no!\" said Mrs. Ripon. \" Get out of the way, you handless wretch !\" \" I can't,\" said Mortification. \" Yea, light of my soul, you are standing on my back!\" In a few minutes, however, the door was opened, and Tom Ripon entered his mothers hou=e. It was quite evident, however, from the man ner and looks of Mortification, as well as from his previous conduct, that the appearance of Jonathan was not all unexpected by him. In fact, it was a little speculation of Mortifica tion's own to let Jonathan Wild, for a considera tion, sit in the dark on the shop counter of an evening, in order to take notice of the customers that came to the fence. It was not for the purpose of apprehending them, or bringing them to justice, that Jonathan Wild required such information. On tho contrary, his sole object was to be able to confound them by saying, \" On such a night 3'ou sold so much plate to Mrs. Ripon, or you parted with a gold watch and seals, without giving me my share.\" In this manner he acquired the extraordinary ascendancy he possessed for so long over the criminals of the metropolis, who began to be lieve him to have a preternatural means of ac quiring a knowledge of their proceedings. Tom Eipon looked from one to the other with doubt. The shop was very dark, aud as it was the policy of Mrs. Ripon and Mortification to keep it so, in order that the prying eyes of intruders from without should not learn too much of the little transactions taking place within, Tom llipon and Mortification had to grope their way to the back parlour. Now, Mortification was a step or two in ad vance of Tom, so that the latter could hardly un derstand how it was that some one trod upon one of his heels. But whatever might be his opinion of Morti fication, he could scarcely believe that he would actually betray him into the hands of Jonathan. \" Come, come,\" said Wild. \" I see you doubt me ; and perhaps it will take some time to con vince you that I bear no malice.\" \" Hilloa !\" cried Tom ; \" what's that ?\" \"Yea, what is what?\" \"Are you behind or before me, Mortifica tion ?\" \" Yea, I am here, Thomas ; and, as the Psalmist remarks, one cannot be in two places at once. Come on, Thomas \u2014 worthy youth, come on. Yea, thou shall have the fat of the land, and the lean of the land likewise, judi ciously mixed ; for, as the Psalmist remarks, he who brings silver spoons to the melting pot shall be welcome, but for him who bringeth gold ones, yea, there shall be a clashing of cymbals.\" \" Hold your row !\" cried Tom. \"And, yea, a braying of horns.\" Toiu started. A heavy knocking came at the shop door. \" Good!\" said Wild. \" I have an opportunity of convincing you now that I mean you no harm !\" \"What opportunity?\" \"Listen!\" The knocking came with redoubled force. \" Those pistol-shots,\" said Wild, \" with which you favoured me a short time ago have reached"], [299, "293 r.niTtr heros. the ears of some of my bull-dogs, and alarmed them. There is a party outside strong enough to take possession of the whole of this place, and secure every one of you as prisoners ; but you will no longer doubt me when I send them away!\" The effect was very similar to some one knocking loudly from without. \" Ah !\" said Tom; \"a customer!\" Wild looked a little suspicious. \" Yes, I will go,\" said Mortification ; \" it may be that some person actually mistaketh this re spectable establishment for a fence.\" \" I will go,\" said Tom. \" Shall I ask him in, whoever it is ?\" Wild advanced to the door, and struck it heavily with the handle of his hanger. \" Hilloa ! hilloa, bull-dogs ! \" he shouted. \" Away with you ! No scent here ! Away with you ! All is well !\" \"Certainly,\" said Wild, speaking for Mrs. Ripon, to whom the question was addressed, \u2014 \"certainly; but, as the sight of me might not be agreeable, I will hide myself behind this door.\" The knocking at the door ceased. \" You hear ?\" said Wild ; \" and I think, after the manner I have trusted you, you might show an equal confidence in me.\" \" Trusted us !\" said Tom. \" In what way ?\" \" That'll do,\" said Tom, as he passed out of the back parlour. \" Why, you might have taken my life ten times over, while I had my back to you just now, when I was speaking to my men.\" Crossing the shop, he opened the door, and making his way at once into the street, he closed it with a loud bang ; and then, at a pace which it would have been difficult to follow, or keep up with, he made his way towards Whitcombe House. CHAPTER CCLXXYIII. Felix Heron had been by far too anxious re garding the success of Lady Castleneau's under taking to retire to rest that night, and he received from Tom a relation of what had taken place with mingled feelings of admiration and grati tude. FELIX HERON RESUMES HIS OLD LIFE ON THE ROAD. Tom Ripon had no occasion to be particularly well pleased with this sudden and unexpected appearance of Wild at the fence in Wardour Street. If the necessity for declaring his own con tinued existence had still maintained, he would have been embarked in a sea of troubles. But, under the circumstances, what was he to do? An attempt would no doubt have been made by his enemies at the Court of St. James's to procure his attainder, on the charge of having offered personal violence to the monarch, which, of course, would have involved the disinheritance of that son whose future interests formed the basis of all these transactions. True, he might, at some odd moment, take Wild's life, but that would be so like assassina tion, that Tom Ripon was not the sort of person to bring himself to the commission of the act. There seemed no resource, then, but to allow Wild to pursue his own course. Heron drew a long breath of relief, with tha conviction that his, worst foe, Lord Clackington, was no longer able to do him a mischiof that might be irreparable. Jonathan, with th\u00a9 most careless air in the world, walked into the back parlour of the fence. \" Come,\" he said, \" now that we are all agreed, and understand each other, let us to supper.\" Mrs. Ripon was anything but pleased at such a guest, aud the look she darted at the Rev. Mortification was quite sufficient to let that per sonage know what kind of remonstrances were likely to be made to him when Jonathan Wild should have left. \" Tom Ripon,\" ho said, \" I owe you many thanks, and I suppose I cannot better repay you for the service you have done than by reiterating my promise to you, that Daisy shall be at your service whenever you require her ; but always bear in mind one thing, which is, that her safety is very dear to me, and should you be hard pressed at any time, rather give in and surrender than lot her run the chance of danger to life or limb.\" And Tom Ripon was uneasy. He could not entirely divest his mind from the idea that, after all, this was but some wilfully laid trap for his recapture. Tom replied with some emotion to this speech of Captain Heron's. \" I mean to be careful of myself, Captain, but ten times more so of Daisy; and even now that you are so willing to lend her to me, I seem as if I shrunk from taking her.\" \"I do not wish you to have that feehng, Tom , and yet \" Heron paused, and paced the room for several seconds in silence. And Tom Ripon adopted a very ingenious ex pedient for leaving the house. Mrs. Ripon kept scales and weights in that back parlour, by the use of which, after pur chasing silver plate, she arrived at something Uke an approximation to its value. The parlour was not brilliantly illuminated by the single candle that burut in it; and Tom Ripon, affecting to walk about in it in a careless manner, was able to possess himself of one of the smaller weights. \" Yet what, Captain ?\" \" I will mako a confidence with yon, Tom. The lrind of life I lead stagnates me. I havo neither the health nor the spirit I had in the f i _o air of Epping Forest.\" \" Hurrah !\" cried Tom ; \" we shall be on the road and on the heath again before we are four and-twenty hours older !\" \"Hear me out,\" said Heron. \"I no longer Watching his opportunity, then, of when the door of communication between the shop and the parlour was open, Tom Ripon flung the weight right across the shop at the upper panel of its door."], [300, "294 edith imr.r.N. gination of the Earl of Bridgewater, or of Colonel Trelawney7, or of the young Marquis of Ormond, that the inhabitants of Whitcombe House re quired subsidizing, they would freely have done so. speak to you as a boy, for you have now come to an age when yeu can understand these things.\" Tom listened with the most absorbed atten- tion. \" You must know, Tom, that the revenues of the earldom of Whitcombe are so large that their possessor might, even in a country like this, where every article, either of necessity or luxury, is at its highest value, live like a prince.\" \" I've heard as much,\" said Tom. \" And yet, owing to the strange position which I now occupy, those revenues are not avail able.\" But Felix Heron never, by word or action, en gendered such an idea. It was on the following evening, then, after this conversation with Tom Eipon, that the stable door of Whitcombe House was opened cautiously, about the hour of nine. From it emerged Ogle. A remarkable change had taken place in hi3 Tom nodded. appearance. In Whitcombe House Ogle had contrived to make himself look like a confidential servant, and, by powdering his hair, and wearing a decorous suit of black, he passed very well for a great, man's butler, or confidential valet. \" IVe heard Ogle say, Captain, that the tenants of tho Whitcombe estates won't pay.\" \" You have heard right, Tom. Taking advan tage of the real or apparent fact that the peerage is in abeyance, not one of them will pay rent for their1 farms or their houses ; and the consequence is, that at this present moment, although sixty thousand a year at least ought to come into our hands, we have pecuniary distress staring us in the face.\" Now, however, Ogle had all the appearance of a rough-rider. c. iy_gu-im.i. He wore top-boots. A faded plum-coloured coat, that had once been a gay article of attire, although it was but toned across the chest, partially exhibited a flowered waistcoat \"That's soon put right, Captain,\" said Tom; \" we have but to sally out and cry, ' Stand and deliver!' and live upon the plunder.\" \" It is a necessity from which there is no escap ing; and so, Tom, I think that you, and I, and Ogle, to-morrow night, will take a trot down to the old forest, and see what may be in store for us on the road there and back.\" His hat was placed rakishly on one side of his head, and a lace cravat of considerable value en circled his neck. Ogle carried a riding-whip in his hand. His object was to make an observation of the little street into which the stables opened, in order to be certain that no spies of Jonathan Wild were lingering about the spot. It was the hour at which the night-watch came on duty, and it might be supposed that the par ticular watchman who had charge of that neigh bourhood might be sufficiently awake to be trou blesome. t;Ah,\" cried Tom ; \"old times are coming back again ! This is just as it should be. Never mind the estates and rents of the earldom of Whit combe, Captain. We shall make quite euough on the road, you may depend, and be all the healthier and all tho happier to make it in that way.\" It might be that Felix Heron really mourned Over the necessity of again embarking in that pre carious profession of a knight of the road, which had characterized his early career. But still it had for him its secret charms. During the whole of the day the night-watch were not supposed to do anything but sleep ; and, so far as the privilege of idleness went, they fully availed themselves of it. Bat, inasmuch as they took upon themselves to repose the whole night long in their watch boxes, there was certainly no extra vigilance at the commencement ol their duty. \" Past nine o'clock, and a showery night !\" \u2022'Hang you!\" muttered Ogle; \"\u25a0 why can't you get along?\" The watchman came drawling past. 11 Stop !\" cried Ogle. \" Hilloa ! What now ; do you want to be taken up?\" \"Certainly not; but I want to know what wages you get ?\" u Wages ? Don't obstruct me in my duty !\" \" Is this the way you answer a nobleman ?\" \" A nobleman, your honour's worship ? I get seven shillings a week, and my coat.\" \" And yon look sharp after this street?\" \" I believe you, your worship ! You see, it's a by-street, and, as Mr. Wild once said to me, ' the stables of WhiUombe House look iuto it ; and, if anything extraordinary about them hap* pens, it's a good half-crown to you to come and tell me.' \" The only person that looked with a kind of mournful distaste upon a recommencement of vhose scenes of difficulty and danger, which ske had seen so much of, was Edith. She shuddered at the necessity that Heron should again go upon the road, even for the pur pose of procuring a subsistence for herself and child. Well she knew that Lady Castleneau would only too gladly appropriate the larger part of her income for the purpose of meeting any neces sities of that description. But that was a resource that Heron could not reconcile himself to, for well he knew that, what with her numerous charities, and the high-minded liberality with which she conducted her whole affairs, that that income was sufficiently ab sorbed. And so it was that Captain Heron once more determined to go upon the road, accompanied by his faithful followers, Ogle and Tom Ripon. It seemed to him easier to embrace that line of life once more than to make himself dependent upon those friends who would otherwise gladly have stepped forward to save him and Edith every possible pecuniary inconvenience. \" Half-a-crown ?\" \"Yes, your honour; half a crown extra, to keep wide awako and look about me.\" \"I comprehend. For five shillings, then, you Had it for a single moment crossed the ima- J"], [301, "295 EDITH HERON. see nothing, hear nothing, and are as stupid as an owl ?\" Heron was in his full costume as a knight of the road, but it was less noticeable than it might have been, because over it he wore a roquelaire cloak, which permitted little more than one arm and his boots to be visible. \" Certainly, your honour.\" \" There's tho money. Be off ! You will get the same sum every week.\" \"Bless your honour! that makes seven-and sixpence; for I'll go to Mr. Wild, and get his half-crown, by telling him I've seen something very strange at Number Eight !\" \" Do as you please, so that you are dis creet.\" It was a strange and new sensation now, for Felix Heron to find himself mounted upon Daisy, and going in search of adventures. His thoughts flew back to the past When in Epping Forest, leading the rough, rude life he there did, he was a great deal happier than he had ever been in the gilded saloons of Whitcombe House. The watchman made the be6t of his way from the street. Ogle then tapped at the wicket-door of the stables, and Tom Kipon soon came forth, lead ing two horses. The evening was cloudy, and now and then a scatter of rain, accompanied by a slight squall of wind, which seemed to threaten an inclement night. One was for Ogle, and one was for himself. No doubt Tom thought himself gorgeously attired ; for he was in his new, full costume as a highwayman, with every appointment about it in exact imitation of Captain Heron. Strapped, however, to the back of the saddle of the horse which he was to ride, Tom had a small bundle, which consisted of a complete disguise, which he could slip on over his highwayman's clothes. Such a state of weather, however, was favour able enough to such proceedings as were con templated by Felix Heron and his party. Half an hour's sharp trotting took them quite clear even of the suburbs of London ; and the fresh, cool, grateful air of the country came plea- santly upon their senses. Tbe slight rain that had fallen at intervals seemed to have brought forth the fragrance of the fields and flowers ; and but for those near and dear ties that bound him to London, Felix Heron would gladly have bidden farewell for ever to the wilderness of bricks and mortar, and taken up his abode once again in the picturesque recesses of the forest. In a few seconds Heron himself emerged from the stable, followed closely by Daisy. Then Ogle spoke, in a low tone. \" I think, Captain, every possible arrangement has been made.\" \" I am sure of it, Ogle. Have you the keys to the wicket-gate?\" \" I have.\" Heron was riding on considerably in advance, when he became conscious that he waB rapidly gaining upon some horseman who was somewhat before him on the road. \" Keep one yourself, give Tom one, and hand me the third. There is just a possibility tbat we i.iay be, by some circumstances, separated ; and if so, it will be of the utmost importance that we should individually be able to get into the stable here, without a moment's delay.\" \" All right, Captain. I've tried the keys, and they fit like an old glove.\" Heron patted the neck of Daisy. \" So,\" he said, \" once again on to the road, in search of adventures, you will carry your old master, Daisy, to whom you have been so good a friend on many an emergency.\" Daisy pushed her head caressingly against the breast of Heron ; and then Tom Eipon looked at her with a sigh, and shook his head, for now that Captain Heron had determined to go upon the road again himself, Tom was forced to put up with one of the other horses from the stables of Whitcombe House. Without in the least accelerating the speed of Daisy, Heron soon came up with a dusky-looking figure mounted on a very tall horse. The horse had what is called plenty of action ; but, as is very common in regard to such steeds, the progress made was by no means commensu rate with the bustle of making it. The dark-looking horseman drew quite away to the shadow of the hedges on bis own side of the road as Heron came up. It was evident that the stranger wished to avoid any encounter or colloquy with Heron ; but it was a rule with the latter, which he rarely infringed, to speak to any one he saw on the road, in order that he might know them again. \" Follow me, both of you !\" cried Heron, as he mounted. \" We will take, as I have said, the road to Epping Forest; and our two places of refuge will be the stables of Whitcombe House and the deep recesses of those leafy glades which we know so well.\" \" All's right, Captain !\" said Ogle. \" We have met many an adventure upon the road between here and there, and may meet with many still.\" \"Yes,\" repliod Heron; \"the world may be older somewhat, but the times are still un changed.\" CHAPTER CCLXXEX. FELIX HERON MEETS WITH A MTSTERIOUS STRANGER ON THE ROAD TO EPPING. \" A pleasant night, sir ! \" cried Heron, as he slackened the speed of Daisy. The horseman muttered something in reply which Heron could not catch, and evidently made an effort to ride on more quickly. As he did so, even in the dim h'ght of that country road, Heron could see that he wore spurs, which glittered as though they were of some costly material. He fancied, too, that he saw, slightly projecting beneath the cloak which the stranger horseman wore, the scabbard of a sword. As lie spoke, he touched the neck of Daisy lightly with his gloved hand, and at a smart trot the little party started from the neighbourhood of St. James's, to gain as soon as possible the open country."], [302, "296 EDITH HERON. grasped the wrist of the officer, and pointed his pistol in the air. \"Fire now, sir!\" he said, \"it is your most prudent plan.\" \" Fire yourself !\" was the reply. \"Certainly not,\" replied Heron. \"Give me your word that you will take no further advan tage, and at the same time pay me some reason able toll, and you may go free.\" The officer hesitated for a few seconds, and then, in much more conciliatory tones than he had hitherto spoken, he said, \" I don't believe you are a highwayman at all, and I charge you, upon your honour and faith, to tell me if you have any knowledge of Sir Hugh Durban ?\" \" Not the least. I never heard the name bu fore.\" That scabbard, too, had a glittering, rich aspect about it which awakened Felix Heron's curio sitv. A touch to Daisy was quite sufficient to let her know that she was to keep up with the other horse. That was done without the slightest effort whatever. Heron spoke again. \" I remarked, sir, that it was a pleasant inght.\" \" And I told you, sir,\" replied the horseman, \" that you were quite welcome to your opinion.\" \" You are very obliging.\" \" Take it as you will. Good night, sir.\" \" Nay,\" said Heron ; \" companionship, upon such a road as this, is never a bad thing, and may be a good one.\" \" You are welcome likewise to that opinion ; but as I do not require any companionship what ever, permit me, without offence, to dispense with yours.\" \" Do you happen to know, then, General Gas ton?\" \" Certainly not. But will you permit me to ask, sir, the reason of these strange interro gatories ?\" \" The full reasons were too tedious to men tion; but if you are a gentleman, or even a highwayman with so much of the gentleman about you as your conduct seems to have shown this night, I would fain ask a favour of you.\" \" Hush !\" \" But, sir, have you not heard that this road, iu particular, is the haunt of highwaymen ?\" \" No, sir.\" \"Then I am most happy to be able to inform you of so interesting a fact.\" \" Sir, good night.\" \" Nay, sir ; allow me likewise' to add that one of these highwaymen has had the audacity to claim the road as his own property, and to allow no one to pass over it without paying such a toll that, heavy as the exaction is, few persons care to resist it at the price of a life.' \" Ah !'* \" What is it?\" \" Hide aside, sir. I hear a clatter of horses' feet, and suspect that some strong party is on the road.\" Felix Heron was right ; for, although the party was not a very stroug one, four mounted men passed them at a sharp trot, the clattr of their horses' feet quickly dying away in the distance. \" I fancy you comprehend me.\" \"A highwayman?\" \" At your service.\" \"Scoundrel ! Do I look hke the sort of man General Gaston \u2014 for such was the name of the officer who spoke so mysteriously to Felix H&rou \u2014 uttered a deep groan. to be robbed by a single highwayman upon a road like this?\" \" You suffer, sir ?\" said Heron. \" Alas ! alag ! It is as I suspected ! The villain Durban is upon the expedition I was warned of, and carries with him associates suf ficiently powerful to have made my interference worse than useless. Alas ! alas !\" \" Of that you are the best judge,\" said Heron ; \" but as far as my experiences go, I do not see anything the least extraordinary in the trans action. Now, sir, your money or your life, or perhaps both !\" \" Well,\" said the stranger, \" if it must be so.\" As he spoke, he flung aside the cloak, showing that he was in a military costume beneath it ; and from the character of that costume, it seemed to Heron that he must be an officer of some dis tinction. The distress of General Gaston was evidently so unaffected and real, that Heron rephed to it promptly. \" Why, sir, if you allude to those men who have even now passed us, there were but four of them.\" Almost simultaneously with the throwing back of the cloak, the stranger seized on one of his holster pistols from the saddle, and making his horse suddenly rear, he said, calmly, \" Now, Mr. Highwayman, fire away! It will be my turn next !\" \" But I am only one.\" Heron hesitated for a few seconds ; and then, although to engage in an adventure of tho kind that seemed to present itself, was something of a departure from the ideas with which ho had started that night upon the road, he quickly de scended to offer his services to the distressed officer. Heron had heard quite sufficient of military service to be well aware that the officer was pur suing exactly the tactics prescribed for such an eroorgency as he now found himself in. \" No,\" said Heron, \" I will not fire, because I do not see that your horse or mine should be involved in this little transaction ; but still, hav ing commenced it, I can-y it out \u2014 thus !\" As Heron spoke, he sharply turned Daisy, and \u25a0inking her give one of her vaults which she -oms so expert at, ho was on the other side of the mounted officer in an instant. By the time Heron spoke again to General Gaston, his mind was quite made up that what ever mysterious adventure that personage was bound upon, he, Heron, would assist him. There was atone of grief, a sighing utterance of despair, about General Gaston 's manner, which much affected Felix Heron. Close aud accurate observer as he was, he could not but observe the catching of the breath, and the half-smothered sighs, that burst from the heart of the General. Stretching forth his right arm, then, Heron"], [303, "297 EDITH HERON. \" Treat me frankly, sir,\" he said. \" Can I be of any assistance to you?\" General Gaston hesitated for a few seconds, and then he said, rather as if communing with himself, than replying to Felix Heron, \" You are bold and resolute ?\" \" I listen \"A dear friend, and brother companion-_a arms, who met his death upon the battle-field in India, made me the guardian of his only child\u2014 a girl eighteen years of age, of delicate constitu tion, and fragile structure.

A great calamity was hovering above my house, and this day week I was aroused early in the morning by the cries of my ward's maid, and in ten minutes more it was established beyond a doubt that the fair young girl who had been committed to my charge, and who might have formed the sunshine of my future existence, was no more.\" \"Dead?\" \" It is a common feeling,\" said Heron. \"Yes, I know tol what you would allude \u2014 the well-known difficulty of believing that any one we knew well in life has passed away from it for ever.\" \" And is not that your feeling ?\" \"Scarcely. But let me hurry on with my narration, for we have, indeed, much to do to night.\" The General spoke in a tone of deep emotion, and Felix Heron became irresistibly attracted by the words he uttered. \" Alas, yes ! Some mysterious ailment of heart and brain had hurried her from a world she had seen - 1 little of, and I was left lament ing.\" \" This young, fragile girl, in all her beauty aud all her innocence, reached my homo in London. I am single, and have always led the life of a solitary man, but from the first momeat I beheld my young and lovely ward, 1 fe_. that she was dearer to mo than life itself.\" The General was silent for several minutes. The curiosity of Felix Heron was strongly excited, not so much by what he had heard, as from the conviction on his own mind that he had yet something to hear more curious still. The General, as he spoke, turned upon the saddle, and looked full in the face of Felix Heron. \" I will tell you all that followed,\" added the General, \" as briefly as I can, A letter was found in Ida's dressing-case directed to me.\" \" Her name was Ida ?\" The night was a dark one. And yet there was that mysterious kind of reflected light in the night sky which, although it was not sufficient to enable Felix Heron to detect the featu.es of the General, he yet could see sufficient to enable him to come to the con clusion that his new acquaintance was a.singu larly handsome man. u It was. Oh, when shall I forget it ? The letter was brought to me in the extremity of my grief. It is here, and has rested since that moment next my heart.\" The General produced the letter, but it was by far too dark to enable Felix Heron to see more than its outlines. He was, at the same time, by no means suffi ciently advanced iu years to put him out of the pale of female society, even when represented by so young and lovely a personage as he stated his ward to be. Up to this moment, however, they hid trotted on side by side, and had reached a portion of the road where stood a lonely cottage. That road was as familiar to Felix Karon as the doorstep at Whitcombe House. \" i _-oceed, General,\" he said. \"lam cteeply int. rested in your statements.\" \" And I feel , irresistibly compelled to trust you. I loved my ward dearly \u2014 fondly \u2014 de votedly.\" \"And she?\" The old woman, who was an inhabitant of tho cottage, had been many a time recipient of his bounty during the period when he held posses sion of Epping Forest, with the gallant band who had obeyed his orders. The night was still young, and a thin stream of light showed itself from one of the cottage windows. \" I know what you would ask. Did she re turn the passion ?\" Yes.\" \" I cannot answer you, It is a question I can not answer to' my own heart, for looking at the disparity of our years, I dreaded to intrude the feelings of a veteran on the attention of one as yet only on the threshold of existence.\" \" Let us pause here for a moment,\" said the General; \"and you shall see this letter upor which I have acted, but which, notwithstanding is a great mystery to me, and has filled me with many strange doubts and fears.\" llerou trotted up to the cottage door and tapped at it with his riding whip. \" But what happened, sir V \" A distant relation of my own, and a sort of forty-fourth cousin, or something of that degree, to my young and lovely ward, suddenly begun to visit at my house, nis age did not exceed eight-and-twenty, and he was singularly hand some.\" . \"Hilloa! hilloa!\" he cried. \"Dame Fearon, if you are up yet, let us have a light !\" \"Gracious providence!\" cried the old woman as she flung open the window. \" It'6 the Captaiu himself!\" \" Captain !\" said the General. \" Have you like wise served ?\" \" Ah, I begin to see !\" \" You think he was my rival ?\" \" Was it not so ?\" \" No. Along with that singular beauty of person, which he inherited from a father who was one of the noblest gentlemen who eyer lived, he bore about him an expression of liber tine recklessness which no polish of manner or hypocrisy of words could suppress.\" \" Your ward, then, General, dii not love him?\" \" Oh,\" said Heron, with a light laugh, \" wo knights of the road are called Oaptain.\" \" But you are no highwayman iu reality, although you affected to be one ?\" \" Indeed, and in truth, I am, General ; and if you are trusting me upon any other supposition, I beg that you \" \"Hold, hold!\" interrupted the General. \"I will trust you upon any supposition, for I feel \" At first, she was indifferent to liim.\""], [305, "299 EDITH HERON. confide ,uu \u00ab ill aid *-.\"\u25a0>, and that I am right in obeying tbe impulse which prompts me to open my heart to you.\" the little Ught in the cottage he read it with greai surprise. \" To my Dear Guardian, General Joseph Gaston. \" A presentiment, which I cannot sliake off, is ever present to me, and warns me of some sudden and mysterious decease. \" Perhaps in the midst of some gay scene, when so stern a monitor as death is completely forgotten. \"Perhaps with joyous music ringing in my ears, when human existence would seem im mortal and full of delight. CHAPTER CCLXXX. lar.NEEAL C.A9TGN MAKES A CONFIDANT AND FRIEND OF FELIX HERON. The old dame, with officious haste, opened the cottage door and trimmed the little light which burned within the humble dwelling. \" Let us enter here,\" said Heron, \" and if you still wish to do so, you can permit me to read the letter you allude to.\" \" Your horse,\" said General Gaston, \" which appears so sagacious and under your control that it will obey a word of command, might probably wait for you, but I am afraid mine can scarcely be so far depended upon.\" \" We will get assistance, then.\" Heron produced two sounds upon the silver whistle he carried with him, and, to thc surprise of the General, Ogle and Tom Ripon rode up to \" Perchance in the solitude of my own ehamber communing with my own heart, and dreaming of a long and happy future, death will come to me, and I shall pass away like a vapour, to be for gotten by all save those who have loved me and will with tears regret me. \"in \\vii__. tcttio lcgieu nits. \" I cannot resist the belief that such will be the case. \" It is in that belief, then, tbat I address these few words to you as my last wishes. \"You are well aware that the whole of my considerable fortune was brought by me to England in the shape of jewels, and acting on your advice, after your kind inquiries of com petent persons, those jewels still remain in my possession, since it is understood that the price of precious gems of their quality is rapidly rising. the spot. \" An, I perceive you have followers !\" \" I certainly was not alone,\" replied Heron ; \" and it may be that I shall be able to render you more efficient assistance than you at first supposed.\" u Doubtless \u2014 doubtless !\" \" There is one thing, however, dear guardian, that you do not know, and that is that these jewels, or the money which purchased them, were acquired in India in a manner that neither you nor I could approve. \" It is not for me to cast a stain on the memory of a beloved father, but he was too anxious that his adored Ida should be lifted far above tho possibility of want of any of the luxuries of ex istence. \" Tom, miud the horses !\" \" Yes, Captain ; though Daisy don't want minding.\" \"Daisy!\" ejaculated the General. \"Surely I have heard that name before?\" \" It is a name of some repute,\" remarked Heron ; \" but dismiss from your mind all that you may have heard either of Daisy or her master, only believing that they are both ready on this night to do you a service.\" \"I do believe so, and at the same timo I shall ever consider that it is not mere accident that has brought us together on the present occa sion.\" \"I look upon these jewels, then, as unsanctified, and I do not believe that they will ever bring peace or happiness to their possessor. \" I implore you, then, to listen with favour, and to carry out implicitly what you will no doubt consider a strange wish I have regarding them. Tom took charge of the horses, and General Gaston, accompanied by Felix Heron, entered the cottage. \"If the presentiments I have regarding my decease should prove true, and if you should find some day that I have passed away from you into the silence of death, I charge you before I am consigned to the tomb to take an opportunity to place the whole of these jewels about me. \" They will not perish as the poor clay which they belong to will, but in the silence of the grave they will no longer exist as a temptation and a snare to human hearts and human virtue. The General threw aside his cloak, and Heron could scarcely forbear a smile to himself at the excessive modesty of his companion in supposing he was past the period of life even for evoking the tenderest sentiments in the breast of one so young as his ward. The General was singularly good-looking, and : at off as he was by a brilliant uniform, it would have been difficult to find a more gentlemanly aud attractive man than he presented. \" I perceive, sir,\" said the General, \" that you .are somowhat surprised that I am in full military costume, tut the Duke of Cumberland held a ! vee at tho Hor.e Guards to-day, where I of ;: -ially attended, and I have not had time to .aiange my dress.

Felix Heron took it, and sitting down close to"], [306, "300 EDITH HERON. may be required to grapple with possible events.\" Felix Heron finished the letter, and looked at the General with no small surprise. \" Well, sir,\" said General Gaston ; \" what think you of that strange epistle?\" \" It is the production of some over-heated fancy.\" \" it may be so.\" \" Of course, however, you paid but little atten tion to these feverish dreams of what must have been a sick person ?\" \" I will accompany you with pleasure. We are but two miles from Woodford. You have perceived that I have a couple of trusty followers with me; and let what will happen, I think that we four will be able to direct things as we wish.\" A look of satisfaction came over the face of the General as he hastily rose. \" I perceive that you will think me weak,\" re plied the General, \"when I tell you that I obeyed the injunctions contained in this letter literally.\" \" Is that possible ?\" \" Yes ; as I have already informed you, this day week Ida was found dead in her own apart ment. Yesterday only she was consigned to her last resting place, in a vault which I purchased in the old church at Woodford.\" \"At once, then!\" he cried, \u2014 \"at once let us proceed ; and if all is well in the tomb of Ida, I will not nourish such fancies again, but believe them only to arise from a distempered imagina tion, and a grief-laden heart.\" Felix Heron and the General left the cottage. \" Keep close, Ogle,\" said Heron ; \" and you, Tom, likewise.\" \" Yes, Captain.\" A sharp trot for a quarter of an hour brought the party to the little village of Woodford, which since that period has grown to be a place of more importance. \" And the jewels ?\" \" I myself obeyed her request by placing them upon her silent breast.\" \"And the open bier, how was that managed?\" \" I expected opposition from every one, and on the pretence of taking a last adieu and a last look of the coffin that contained Ida, I remained in the vault after all had quitted it, and with an instrument I had ready with me for the purpose, I wrenched off the lid of the coffin and so left her, with the jewels sparkling upon her dead form, on the open bier she desired.\" \" This is indeed a strange story,\" said Heron. \"You think me foolish, perhaps superstitious, and vou will think me more so before I have done.\" The church was rather an ancient structure, and looked picturesque and solemn in the faint moonlight, which now had made its way through the clouds, and was rendering objects much more distinct than they had been an hour previously. There was an ancient grove of trees close to the church, which afforded a perfectly secure covert for the four horses, as well as for Ogle and Tom Bipon. \" Eemain here, both of you,\" said Heron. \" This gentleman and I are going into the church.\" \"Goodness gracious, Captain!\" said Tom; \" you don't expect anything is going on there at this time of night except ghosts.\" \" That's just it,\" said Heron. \" What, Captain ! you don't mean to say you're actually going to look for one of them on his own grounds ?\" \" Terhaps I am,\" said Heron ; \" but, at all events, attend well to the instructions I now give you. If you hear my whistle three times, make your way to yonder iron gates, at which one of you can keep guard, preventing any per son from passing, while the other will come into the church to look for me.\" Heron might have replied that that was hardly possible ; but the General, as he rested his head upon his hand and sat by the table of the little cottage, added, in a low voice, \" Last night I had a strange dream.\" Heron could not forbear the smile that sat for a moment on his lips. \" Bear with me,\" added the General ; \" there may be more in these things than is dreamt of in our philosophy.\" \" I should fancy your imagination was power fully excited by the events you have detailed as talring place yesterday, and which would no doubt people your slumbers with strange visions.\" \" It may be so ; but, after a short, uneasy slumber, I awakened about tho midnight hour, fancying I was called upon by name, and that the voice was Ida's.- \"Mind you don't forget, Ogle,\" said Tom; \" you're to go into the church to look for the Captain and the ghosts, while I hold on to the iron gate.\" Ogle did not seem very well pleased with this arrangement; but he made no audible ob jection to it. '\u2022 So.strongly impressed was I with this vision, that 1 started from my bed and hastily replied. \" All was still then ; and, concluding that it was merely a passing dream, I fell into repose again, but was again startled into wakefulness by a similar call. \" We'll see about it, Tom,\" he said ; \" but in the meantime just help me to tether the horses to one of these young saplings.\" \" Be vigilant,\" added Heron. He then rejoined the General; and, passing through the iron gates that have already been mentioned, they took their way towards the church, treading very lightly, and not exchang ing a word until they stood beneath its ancient porch. \" A third time was this singular episode re peated before the night passed away ; and from that time to this, the intenso desire to re-visit the tomb of Ida has grown into a longing I can not resist.\" \" It is very strange.\" \" It is so, and yet may be nothing more than ft disordered fancy. But now, having heard the whole of these particulars, I ask yon still to accompany me on this expedition ; for ray mind is troubled, and a cooler judgment than my own The place was profoundly still. The light rain that had been falling in the early part of the night had ceased. The wind, which in gusty squalls had made its own rough music among the tree-tops, h\u00bbrt"], [307, "301 EDITH HERON. thing to do with the church ; but he soon found that that idea was fallacious. now quieted down to the lightest possible air that could blow. The General spoke in a whisper. \" I have the key of the vault,\" he said ; \" but we must find some means of entering the church, if its doors, as I suppose will naturally be the case, are locked\" The strange sounds not only were connected with the church, but soon localized themselves as coining from one of the old oaken doors that led from the churchyard into the sacred edifice. \" You hear \u2014 you hear ?\" again whispered the General. \" We will try,\" said Heron. The heavy, nailed, Gothic, studded door, that opened from the porch, was tried, and found to be perfectly secure. Heron then went a little distance into the churchyard and looked about him. \" I do.'' \" Tell me, then^ if iu your experience you pan give a name to those sounds ?\" \" Easily ' Some one from without is trying to effect an entrance into the church.\" \" For what object ?\" \" That, at present, we can scarcely guess ; but we can easily seclude ourselves in one of these ancient pews, and there, free from all observa tion, be mute spectators of whatever may happen.\" A range of 6niall windows ran along one side us the church ; and as the lower portion of them was not about five feet from the ground, they were easily accessible. After trying several of them, Heron found that one of them could be easily opened, although it was at the expense of one of the small, diamond-shaped panes of glass, which he had to break in order to get at the fastening within. \" I will enter the church,\" said Heron, \" and then help you in, General.\" \" It was to be \u2014 it was to be !\" whispered the General. \" All these events I feel convinced are following each other in regular pre-ordained succession.\" \" We shall see,\" added Heron. \" Follow me and trust that all may yet be well. Providence ordains no mischief, although we are not always good judges of the paths that lead to good.\" Tllere was an ancient pew in the church, nearly as large as a room. Felix Heron had more practice, probably, in dexterous climbing than General Gaston, aud certainly he insinuated himself through the small window into the church in a manner that would have done credit to any harlequin. Heron was somewhat puzzled at first in re gard to the object upon which his feet rested, after he had entered by the little Gothic window. On looking more closely, however, he found it was a tomb, on which lay in effigy the full length figure of an armed knight. When once Heron ascertained the reason of the uneven surface on which he trod, he was easily able to accommodate himself to it. Besting one foot upon the mail clad-breast of the warrior, and the other upon the window-sill, he assisted General Gaston to enter the church. It was deeply enclosed by curtains, likewise, which cast a funereal gloom about it, and singu larly adapted it for a place of espial or secrecy. CHAPTER CCLXXXI. FELIX HERON PROVES TO GENERAL GASTON THAT HE IS A FRIEND INDEED. A very strange light now shone through the sacred edifice. How still and solemn the place was ! \"Alas!\" said the General, in low tones, \"little did I suspect that six-and-thirty hours would not pass over my head before I stood again beneath this roof.\" As the moon rose higher on that night of par tial rain and squally winds, it seemed to brills a softening and gentle influence with it. The dark clouds were scattered. \" Courage !\" said Heron. \" It is always best to remove imaginative fancies from the mind as quickly as may be.\" \" True \u2014 most true.\" Through a long rift, extending many thou sand miles in boundless space, the bright pale face of the silvery satellite of this earth shone down in all its beauty. But the moonbeams had to pass through the old coloured glass of the Gothic windows of the church. \" You would never have been happy until you had re-vi6ited the tomb of your fair ward, and it is far better to have the opportunity of doing so in my society than by yourself. Lean on me \u2014 I can support you. That will do ; now leap ; and here we are, General, in safety, on the marble floor of the church.\" These words had scarcely escaped the lips of Felix Heron, when a strange noise resounded through the ancient building. It was not a loud noise by any means, but sounded like the dull, heavy echo of some dis turbing influence in the immediate vicinity. The General grasped the arm of Felix Heron, and in a voio= \u201e'. some alarm, he whispered, \" Tell me \u2014 oh, tell me, j.^ who are younger and have sharper senses than __._,' own, what sounds are those ?\" That circumstance it was which gave them their strange appearance. The ancient edifice seemed full of faintly co loured light ; and, if anything could tend more than another to produce a feeling of reverential and almost superstitious awe, it was certainly that singular preternatural-looking atmosphere which pervaded the whole building. The mysterious noise at the door continued. Battling, scraping. Heron understood the signification of those sounds instantly. Some one, by no means an adept at that kind of work, was engaged in trying to pick the lock of the church door. \"Hush! let us listen !\" Heron whispered as much to the General. \" I knew it !\" was the reply. \" I was sure Heron could hardly convince himself tnat tio sounds \u2014 strange though they were \u2014 had any- -\u25a0fit!\""], [308, "302 EIDTH heron. \" No, I won't do that as I've come thus far.\" \" Ha, ha !\" laughed another. \" I thought, \" But who can it be ?\" \" The villain Durban!\" \" And his errand ?\" \" The spoliation and robbery of the dead !\" This idea of the General's was too congruous Tom Croaker, you were quite proud of your an cestors ; for, sometimes, you talk about family tombs and statues, and all that sort of thing, be longing to what you would make us beUeve were your great progenitors.\" \" Oh, that's all very well ! I like to have great ancestors as well as anybody; but I've an earnest desire to keep out of their company as long as possible.\" \"Peace, all of you!\" cried Durban; \"Have you your lantern here, Jack Loder ?\" \" To be sure I have.\" \u00bbud likely to be the truth for Heron to doubt it. \" Be at ease, General Gaston,\" he whispered ; \" and let us thank heaven that we are here to defeat so unholy a project.\" \"Yes; thank heaven!\" sighed the General. The little, low, Gothic door of the church yielded. The bungling picklock had, at last, effected its purpose ; and, slowly creaking on its hinges, the door opening wide, admitted a stream of moon light, perfectly white and silvery, to fall upon the floor of the church. \" Open the slide and let us look about us. This odd kind of light puzzles and confounds me.\"* General Gaston was about to utter an excla mation, but Heron caught him by the arm, and whispered tl Hush !\" From the open air there stepped into that broad gleam of moonlight on the marble floor of ihe old church, the figure of a man. He turned and beckoned to his comrades without, and then three other persons entered ihe church. A broad gleam of light from the lens of a lan tern radiated on the wall of the church, and, in an instant, the beautifully-coloured atmosphere, compounded of the moonbeams and the stained glass windows, seemed to vanish. \" Hold a moment,\" said the man who was called Tom Croaker. \" Let us all understand. Durban, what is to be done.\" \" I will tell you ; gather round me here.\" The three associates of Durban stood close to The person who had first made his appearance, spoke in low, angry tones. him, and the iniquitous little group of men were thrown into strong relief by the rays of the lan tern, the slide of which was still kept open. \" I could not venture,\" said Durban, speaking in low tones, which, however, in the silent re pose of that place were distinctly audible to Felix Heron and General Gaston, \u2014 \" I could not venture to tell you what I am now going to tell you anywhere but here.\" \" Out with it, Durban ! We are snug enough and quiet enough.\" \" To be sure,\" said another ; \" and I woul.\". venture to say that there's not another living soul but ourselves within earshot.\" \" Of that I am well convinced,\" added Durban ; \" and now listen to me. A person, whom I may as well call a young lady, has been buried in _\u2022, vault in this church with a diamond ring upon her finger worth a thousand pounds.\" \" Indeed !\" exclaimed the other three. u Confound the moon, and all moonlight, say I ; give me a lantern for this sort of work. Close the door, one of you !\" The door was closed, and then within the church the only light that remained was that mysterious- coloured atmosphere which had al ready greatly charmed and interested Felix Heron. He whispered in the lowest possible tones to the General. \"You saw those persons, and, in particular, the man who first entered ?\" \" I did.\" \" And you heard his voice ?\" \"Too well.\" \" You know him ?\" u It is Durban. I pray you, sh\", take yonr Itand from off my arm. Thank heaven, I am armed ! And now that I feel confident I know the purpose of these wretches, I will no longer tolerate their presence even so near as they are to the tomb of Ida !\" \" Yes ; and I thought as we were all some what out at elbows and bare of pocket, that two hundred and fifty guineas or so to each would not be amiss.\" \"Hush \u2014 hush! Let me implore you to be silent !\" \" Then you mean to share and share alike, Durban ?\" \" What manner of fight is this ?\" said the man who was named Durban, still speaking in low, guttural tones to his companions. \" I feel half dazed by it! What does it mean ?\" \" It's the moonlight,\" replied another, \"through the coloured glass windows.\" \" I certainly do.\" \"Well, that's liberal!\" \" The villain !\" whispered General Gaston. \" Poor Ida's jewels are worth at least thirty thou sand pounds !\" \" Hang the moonlight ! I thought we had shut it out when that door was made fast again. \" I don't half like this job,\" growled another of the men. \"Hush!\" said Heron, in his lowest possible tones. \" Do you not understand that he wishes Us purchase the assistance of his comrades in crime as cheaply as he can, by deceiving them as to the amount of tire booty ?\" \"Yes \u2014 yes! I comprehend now.\" \" Let us listen further.\" \" Indeed !\" cried Durban, raising his voice ; \" there spoke Tom Croaker, as a matter of course. I wonder what job you would like except that of playing at dice from night till morning ?\" \" Don't be bullying me ! I never was partial to ohurehes, and churchyards, and family vaults, and those sort of things.\" \" Then, if you don't like the job, leave us and let us manage it among ourselves. \"Yes,\" added Tom Croaker, \"it's what I oall liberal ; and I'm only surprised, Durban, that you did not keep the whole affair to yourself.\" \" It is not a pleasant thing to como to a place hke this alone at night.\" \" Ah, that's it !\""], [309, "303 I HERON j-.d; as to give it the appearance of it never having been tampered with.\" It will be seen in all these arrangements that Durban reserved to himself the task of proceeding into the vault. \" Partly so ; but I wish to do you all a good turn.\" The three men coughed, to intimate their doubtful reception of this idea. \" You may believe me or not, as you like,\" said Durban ; \" but such was partly my motive ; and now I will proceed to point out to you the door of the vault.\" But yet the circumstances were sufficiently mysterious, that neither Felix Heron nor General Gaston were able to come to a direct conclusion in regard to them. \" Ay \u2014 ay ! we lose time !\" The General made a movement to sally forth from the pew, and laid his hand upon his sword hilt, but FeUx Heron restrained him. That is to say, they could not imagine how Durban had come to his knowledge of the fact that Ida was placed in the tomb so richly adorned with the Indian jewels. It was a circumstance that had never passed the lips of General Gaston to any human being until he communicated it to Felix Heron. \" Not yet \u2014 not yet ! Let us hear more !\" The state of agitation of General Gaston wa3 extreme, and it was evident he scarcely had the power to speak. \" If I could only persuade you,\" whispered Heron, \" to leave the whole of this adventure now to me \" Durban's criminal associates now, however, began to distribute themselves in the manner suggested by him. \" No \u2014 no !\" Felix Heron felt that the time for action had come. \" Believe me, it would be better. Your feelings will only be harrowed by a sight of those mourn ful remains which have to be defended against these despoilers of the dead.\" \"Follow me, General,\" he said; \" and although your rank might entitle you to command, permit me, as more used to adventures of this kind, to direct you.\" \" I will obey.\" \" Prevent, then, that man at the door of the church from interfering ?\" \" Certainly.\" The General, by a few hasty steps, crossed the pavement of the church, and to the astonishment of that one of the associates of Durban who was there on guard, he faced him, and hastily drawing his sword, placed its point within an inch of his throat, as he cried, \" Stir hand or foot, and you are a dead man.\" \" I will steel my heart against such feelings, and do my duty !.' \" Hush ! they speak again !\" \" This low iron door iu the walL\" said Durban, \" opens upon a flight of steep steps, which lead down to the vault we have to visit.\" \" It's locked.\" 11 We hardly expected to find it open. Come, Jack Loder, you pretended to be an adept with the picklock, although it seemed to me you bungled at the church door.\" \" The old lock was so heavy,\" muttered the man ; M but this one seems more modern, and I shall make a better job of it.\" \"You will understand,\" added Durban, \"that I will descend myself and procure the diamond ring, while you all keep watch above. Not that I fear any interruption, but it's better to do a job like this in good company. The vault is a new Dne, and, with the exception of the remains of the young girl I speak of, contains nothing that any man might shrink from.\" The scraping and rattling of the picklock in the keyhole of the vault door now came plainly upon the ears of General Gaston and Felix Heron. Terror took possession of the gambler and roue, for such indeed he was ; and, but for the door behind him, against which he leant heavily, he would have fallen to the floor of the church. While the General was thus playing his part, Felix Heron was not idle. Half a dozen rapid strides brought him to the little iron door . in the wall, which led down to the vault. And Heron's progress so far was completely unnoticed by the man named Loder, who was there waiting for his iniquitous principal Durban, who had descended the narrow staircase to the home of the dead. The state of agitation into which these sounds threw General Gaston rendered him almost incapable of following the advice of Felis Heron, to keep still until the proceedings of Durban and hie villanous associates had as sumed more* importance. The curiosity of Loder had been strongly ex cited, and he was projecting his head and body as far as he could down the staircase, while he held witli one hand to the side of the door. Felix Heron had had no such precise intention when he reached that spot, but seeing the favourable position of Mr. Loder for such an act, he, with one hearty kick, loosened his hold upon the door-post, and sent him with a flying rush down the vault staircase, before he had time even to utter a cry of alarm. A very few minutes must suffice to make a great change in ihe state of affairs. And those few minutes were rapidly passing away. \" That will do, I think,\" suddenly exclaimed the man who was working with the pick lock. Heron's next 'act was to close the iron door of the vault. \" Yes,u said Durban, \"the door velds.'\" The pick -lock was still in it. A slight turn, and the door was secured. Some loud yells and shrieks came from the vault, which sounded all the more fearful from the half-smothered, strange, echoing way in which they reached the upper air. Another moment, and Felix Heron was by tho side of tho General. \" It is open.\" \"Then our object is all but accomplished. One of you keep watch at the church door- -one, i too, had better go outside, to be sure that there ' are no interlopers in the churchyard. You, Loder, stay here with your picklock, for when , all is done we must fasten up this door again, so"], [310, "EDITH HEIION. 304 \" What has happened ? What have you done, good friend?\" \" I have disposed of two of them, General. \" Spare my life, and I'll confess all,\" cried the man, at whose throat General Gaston still held bis sword. \" with a practised hand. Let us now to th\u00ab vault, and clear it of the presence of those men, who I little suspected would ever have the chance of looking in this world upon the face of Ida.\" \" I am with you,\" said Heron; \"we will de scend instantly.\" To cross the pavement of the church, and reach the little iron door of the vault, was the work of a moment. By slipping down quite close to the door the fellow got upon his knees, for he fully believed, from the expression that Felix Heron had used, in the death of two of his companions. \" If you would save your worthless life,\" said Heron, \" call in your comrade from without.\" \" I will \u2014 I will ; and if you will have the kind ness to settle him instead of me, I shall take it as a great favour. He is a much greater rogue than I am, I assure you, gentlemen.\" \u2022\u2022 Silence !\" CHAPTER CCLXXXII. FELIX HERON AND GENERAL GASTON MEET WITH A SURPRISE IN THE VAULT OF WOODFORD CHURCH. A shriek so fearful, so concentrated, so terrible in its agonizing cadences came from some one in the vaults, that even the tolerably well-strung nerves of Felix Heron were shocked and stag gered by it, and he involuntarily fell back several paces. \" But let me explain that I am rather a poor innocent sort of fellow than otherwise. I'm only twenty-eight years of age, and the villain that's outside is thirty-seven, so I've not had time, gentlemen, to be quite so bad as he is.\" \" Silence, I say, or it will be worse for you.\" \" I will go to the vault,\" -said the General. \" Not alone.\" \" Gracious heaven!\" cried the General, \"what is that?\" Heron recovered himself instantly. \" We will see,\" he said. Follow me, General, and that cry shall no longer be a mystery.\" The skeleton key was 'difficult to move in the locked door. \" There are only two of them there.\" \" True ; but let me accompany you. We will first of all secure these rascals, and then pay our attention to the others,\" \u2022' But they are alone with Ida.\" \" With the dead, General\u2014 you forget.\" \" Aud yet it seems a kind of desecration.\" \" Aud it is what it seems ; but we will soon A terrible fear came over Felix Heron that he had broken it. He dreaded lest too late he had recollected that such things must be managed by skill and by tenderness rather than by force. The General became fearfully impatient. \" Open, open !\" he cried ; \" for the love of heaven, open the door!\" '\u2022 Hush !\" said Heron ; \" it must done quietly, or not at all.\" put an end to that. Now, you fellow, call in your comrade, or prepare for instant death.\" \" I will\u2014 I will ! Heath! Heath!\" cried the man. \" Heath ! Heath !\" \" Is that you, Croaker?\" \" Yes, come hither ; you are wanted !\" \" What's up now ? Is it all done ?\" Mr. Heath rather started at the church porch, The key turned. The lock was shot back. for Felix Heron blew shrilly the whistle which was a signal to Tom Kipon and Ogle that they were wanted. \" Oh, where are my senses ?\" cried the General. \" I have the real key of that door in my pocket,\" \" It matters not.\" \"Now be off,\" said Heron to the trembling wretch who was in the church, and he believing that he was released and permitted to escape, made a dash out to the porch, overthrowing his companion by the suddenness of the shock with which he cam. against him, so that they both fell together by the side of the old tomb close to the spot. Heron forced the door open. Immediately he did so, with a rush, Durban and the men who had been kicked down the stairs flew into the church. But it happened that Durban encountered Felix Heron, and the shock was sufficiently great to give the ruffian so severe a fall upon the stone pavement that he lay insensible. General Gaston had closed with the other man, and exerting a strength and energy Heron would hardly have given him credit for, he raised him in his arms, and flung him bodily into one of the pews with such a force, that he was not likely to move for many minutes. Without a moment's hesitation, then, the General plunged down into the vault. Tom Kipon and Ogle were at hand instantly. Heron, as he looked out from the church saw them in the moonlight. \u2022' Take care of these felows !\" he cried. \" All right, Captain,\" said Tom. \" They're as safe as diamonds in cotton,\" said Ogle. As he spoke, he pounced upon the two men, and holding each by his collar by his main strength, forced them to their feet. Heron then turned his attention to affairs in the inside of the church. Heron quickly followed him. Lying on the floor, half embedded in the thick sawdust, was the lantern Durban had taken with him. General Gaston was standing with his drawn sword a few paces from the porch. It shed but a sickly ray about it ; and Heron, by that light, saw that he was in a small stone chamber, the roof of which was vaulted. But soon his eyes became riveted to the living aud the dead occupants of that last sad home of mortality. The state of agitation in which he had been for some time past had mainly arisen from inaction. But now that he had something to do ho was .aim, cool, and self-possessed. \"You manage these things, sir,\" he said"], [311, "EDITH HEKC head, partially resting upon the fair broer, that lay there apparently in the calmness and stillness of its last reposo.\" .. By the light of tho lantern, Heron could see the sparkle of tho magnificent jewels which adorned the wrists and neck of Ida. \"Rise, sir \u2014 riso !\" he cried to the General. \" There is nothing here to look upon which can givo you a pang, for whatever remembrances you may have of this fair young creature in life, they will not be outraged by beholding her now apparently in deep repose.\" The General looked up. \" Death, death !\" he cried, \u2014 \" tho reposo of death !\" \"Hush! Bo calm!\" \"Ida! Ida!\" \" It is but sleep.\" \" The sleep that knows no awalring ! Ida, Ida ! I did love you, and I have let you pass away for ever !\" On a raised bier, about the centre of the vault -as a coffin, tho lid of which lay by its side. Kneeling by that sad memorial was General Gaston. His head resied on his hands, and he seemed either to have dropped into a swoon, or to be so overcome by his feelings on the occasion, as to be incapable of speech or motion. Heron raised the lantern. He looked upon the face of the dead. As he did so, a surprised expression came over him, for he had seen death before, and this was altogether unlike his remembrances of such a eight. There was a faint flush upon the face. Nothinj; whatever indicated the presence of the Destroyer,, and what imparted a life-like slumbering appearance to the young girL was the fact that one arm hung over the side of the coffin, while the other was raised above her No. 91. \u2014 Edith Heron"], [312, "EDITH HERON. 306 I \" It is no dream,'1 said Heron. \" The lady. lives.\" \" General, this is no time for giving way to such feelings.

What can I do, but suffer and weep?\" P Listen to me. So long as you could keep secret to yourself the fact of leaving these jewels with the dead, all was well ; but now that it is known to others, these sad remains will never rest in peace !\" The vault. The thick-lying sawdust on its floor- \" What would you wish ?\" \" I counsel you to remove these glittering gems, and leave tbe dead to the calm rest which otherwise would be broken by the cupidity of those who have no sense or feeling but their own greed of gain.\" The raised bier. The coffin. All these objects struck her gaze ; and then, as thc truth seemed slowly to dawn upon her that she had been placed in that fearful home of death while life still lingered at her heart, a shudder pervaded her frame, and Heron was fearful she might again lapse into that state of forgetfulness of life from which she had been just rescued. \" It is true \u2014 it is true ! Aud what, can she know either of compliance, or otherwise, with her last wishes ?\" The General slowly stretched one hand to wards the bier. \" Fight against this depression,\" he cried ; \" you are saved, and all will yet be well.\" Heron ran to the foot of the stairs leading from the vault to the church. \" I should not shrink from you,\" he said, \" for even death here is beautiful.\" Tremblingly he raised the hand of Ida, which hung over the sine of the coffin. With fingers that shook at tho task, he essayed to unclasp the brilliant bracelet that encircled the wrist. \" Ogle, Ogle !\" he cried. \" Yes, Captain.\" \" You usually carry a dram-bottle with you- \" A bad habit, Captain. 1 have it not.\" This being the only occasion on which it was ever required. \" All right, Captain !\" cried Tom, who heard the question and answer. \" If one fellow hasn't a thing of that sort, another one 'may. Here you are ! Shall I come down, Captain ?\" \" Yes, at once.\" Theu he uttered a cry. \" What iff this '! \u2014 what is this? The hand is warm\u2014 there is life-blood in it yet ! Ida, Ida ! what is this?\" Was Heron deceived ? ( '..nil d it be real ? Did fancy play him the trick? Was it but the quivering of the lantern light upon the dead eye-lids ? Heron could have sworn at that moment that he saw a slight movement of the eyes of the dead girl. Tom descended into the vault, and the moment he saw the state of affairs there, he would have turned and fled into the churoh again, had not Heron caught him by the coat, and stopped his flight. \" Give nie the case-bottle, if yon have it.\" \" Here, Captain, here ! But let me go. This is rather out of my line. After corpses are pro perly put inte vaults, they ought to stay there.\" \" The young lady lives,\" said Heron, as he took the case bottle containing some strong eau de-vie from Tom Ripon, and prevailed upon Ida to taste a small portion of it. And the General had seen it. Another moment, and he had wound his arms about the supposed corpse. \" She lives ! She lives ! This is a cheat \u2014 a delusion \u2014 a horrible mockery of death only ! Ida, Ida ! Speak to me, if it be but one word, to assure ine that you live 1\" Geneial Gaston might have been deceived by theie 0 ppearances of life, deeply interested as his feelings were.

The over-wrought imagination might impose upon the judgment, aud even the senses. But such could not be the case with Felix Heron.

But I wonder if she's really alive, or only pretending to be so, as she seems to have pretended to be dead for ever so long.\" \"Ida! dear Ida!\" said the General. \"You are stronger \u2014 better?\" Tho breath of the girl heaved with emo tion. She seemed to be struggling with the vitality which wai coming back to her in full force. Short, sharp screams burst from her lips, and then a flood of tears relieved her over-charged heart, and she sank sobbing on tho breast of General Gaston. The girl shuddered. \" What has happened? How has it all corns about ?\" \" You shall know all in good time? Lot us now hasten from this place. Oh, what a happy night is this, and how changed does all th\u00bb world upp.ar to me !\" \"Tell me, my friend \u2014 tell mo,\" criod the General, addressing Heron, \" is this a dream, or have T indeed lived {or 60 much happiness ?\""], [313, "307 EDITH HERON. The General would fain have carried Ida from the vault, but the state of agitation he was iu precluded the possibility of his doing so. \" Descend, then, at once.\" While Ogle was shaking the powder in the pans of his pistols, Durban and his associates, trembling in every limb, aud looking like so many ghosts, descended the steep stone steps into the vault. He could only fold her to hi6 breast, and strive to look at her through his tears. \" You cannot walk, Ida,\" he said \u2014 \" you cannot walk. I will convey you hence. We will find a carnage, and in one short hour you will be in your own home again.\" \" If you please, sir,\" said Tom, \" I don't mind carrying the young lady up-stairs, now that I see she's alive and kicking. I shan't think it's any trouble. Ah, me! she is the one !\" \" Out of the way,\" said Heron. \" General, per mit me. The sooner this young lady is at home, the better.\" Ogle slammed the iron door shut, and turned the skeleton key in the lock. Both Heron and the General had been pro vided with ample cloaks, and these were now wrapped around Ida, till she looked more liko a mummy than a living being of modern times. -\u25a0 Ha, ha!\" cried Tom. \"I've an idea, Captain and I'm sure you'll give mo credit for it.\" \"What is ft, Tom?\" \" Why, you see, Captain, we've only one horse a-piece, so I think the lightest weight among .is ought to take the young lady. If she sits behind me, and puts both her arms round my neck \" Even as he spoke, Heron raised Ida gently in his arms, and sprang up the stone steps. Tho General followed him. \" That's always the way,\" said Tom. \" I get cut out by somebody, just at the moment when I can make myself agreeable; and now she'll :._o to fall in love with the Captain ; but I'll put a spoke in his wheel before, it goes any further. Captain, Captain!\" \" What is it, Tom ?\" \" How pleased your wife and family will be whon they hear how kind you've been to this young lady !\" \" What do you mean, Tom? Are you mad ?\" \" Ha, ha ! I'm not mad \u25a0 \u2014 hut I shall be soon. I could have had her up on my back in a moment.\" \" Silence, Tom ! I shall take her on Daisy.\" \" Oh, yes !\" muttered Tom ; \" of course you will. Well, miss, you'll be very comfortable on Daisy. The Captain's family and Uttle wife often rides on Daisy.\" \" What on earth do you mean, Tom, by these constant allusions to my wife and family?\" \"Oh, nothing, Captain, nothing ! Only I wish I had a wife and family. I'm a single man \u2014 single \u2014 single\u2014 single \u2014 and I never fell in love, even with anybody, till to-night.\" \" Be quiet, Tom, be quiet. General, I ask you to let me carry out this adventure. My horse is swift and sure, and I am rather more cool and collected than you can possibly be ; but ii you have the remotest shadow of an objection to Ida riding with me, say so, and I will lend you my horse, and you shall take charge of her vour self.\" Heron might or might not suspect what Tom's notions were for making this speech, but he turned aud spoke to liim with great gravity. \" You can still do the young lady a great service, Tom.\" \"Only mention it, and it's as good as done.\" \" Stay in the vault, then, and take care of the cofhn.\" \" No,\" said the General \u2014 \" no. To whom could I entrust this treasure of my soul, more truly than to him who has so gallantly helped me this night to life and happiness again ?\" \" That's the way ! \u2014 that's the way.\" said Tom, \u2014 \" they settle it among 'em, and think no more of a man's agonized feelings than if he was nobody in the world. Ah, yes ! this ia the ona I am in for it this time, and no mistake 1\" \" I think I see it !\" cried Tom, as he darted up the steps. \" I'm sure you feel cold, miss. Shall I lend you my boots.\" \"Be off, Tom, and don't make yourself absurd.\" , \"Yes,\" muttered Tom, \"there he goes again. I'm absurd when I fall in love, and everybody else is quite right and romantic.\" \" Ogle,\" said Heron, \" where are the pri soners ?\" \u2022' All here, Captain ; we've taken the liberty of tying them all together in a string.\" \"General, added Heron, \"I think the most righteous retribution that can happen these fel lows is to leave them in the vault from which Ida has so miraculously escaped.\" CHAPTER CCLXXXIII. FELIX HERON HAS A NARROW ESCAPE AT THE HOUSE OF GENERAL GASTON. Ogle rode by the side of Heron. The General followed closely- Torn Ripon brought up the rear. It required such a horseman as Heron to ride with safety encumbered as ho was by Ida, who, wrapped up in those roquelaire cloaks, was, per force, compelled to be perfectly inert, and to rely entirely upon what support she might receive from the disengaged arm of Heron. The little party rode at good speed. \" Farewell, Captain,\" cried Ogle, \" to our pro jected expedition to the Forest.\" \" There is a destiny in suoh things,\" repUed Heron ; \" and this adventure is surely worth a thousand expeditions, even into those fair and \" Be it so, sir.\" \" Ogle, bring them forward.\" Durban and his three rascally associates with terror in their looks, were led to the top of the steps conducting to tbe vault. \" You will please to descend,\" said Heron \u2014 \" unless you prefer death here above. Make yonr election quickly, for we have no time to spare. If you choose death, my men here will 6hoot you. Ogle, are your pistols handy?\" \" Yes, Captain.\" \u00ab' No, no !\" shouted Durban and his comrades : \" teiui live, and we will go anywhere.'"], [314, "EDITH HERON. 308 sictan's first report was not unfavourable, and the \u00bb_sCond one may calm all your fears.\" \" I pray heaven it may !\" There came a low tap at the drawing-room door. beautiful glades, which are endeared to us by so \u2022nanv recollections.\" After a time General Gaston led the way. He was in a state of feverish impatience to reach his home, for although Ida had thus cer tainly been snatched from the very grave, there was so much of mystery in the whole transaction, that ho longed to see her perfectly recovered, in order to hear from her own Ups what account she could give of the strange occurrences of the last week. General Gaston sprung to his feet. The door was opened, and a quiet, gentlemanly- looking man entered the apartment. One glance at his face was quite enough. \" She lives ?\" cried the General. \" She not only lives,\" repUed the physician, \" but will live. Youth has conquered all.\" General Gaston was overcome by his feelings, And Felix Heron was not without his appre hensions. He feared that upon reaching the General's house, it would be found that death had com pleted his victory. The arrangement by which, however, General Gaston went first, materially increased the speed of the whole party, for Heron was not so appre hensive of distancing everybody else by the swiftness of Daisy. and sunk into a chair. \" Come, come, General,\" said the physician : \" you will be in a worse way than my patient up-stairs ; and I am sure this gentleman, whose name I have not the honour of knowing, will join with me in begging you to be calm and tranquil.\" \" Joy does not kill,\" said Heron. \"He is better already.\" The General sighed deeply. \" I ought to be better. I ought to bo thank ful. I ought to be fuU of peace and content ment.\" At length the mansion of tho General was reached. It was a handsome house, at the West End of tho town. The General knocked rapidly and furiously at the outer door, which the alarmed haU-porter flung open wide. \" WeU \u2014 weU ! All is well that ends weU ! And as we physicians are a sort of privileged gossips of the community, I would fain know how the strange events of this night have come about.\" \" Permit me, dear friend,\" said the General, addressing Heron, as he took from his arms the apparently lifeless body of Ida. Then, before he could cross the threshold of his house, a woman, in the dress of a servant, appeared coming down the grand staircase. The moment she cast her eyes upon the burden the General carried, she uttered a shriek of dismay, and would have fled from the house. \" I am indebted,\" said tho General, \" to this gentleman for the life of your fair patient, and, I do honestly think, for my own Ukewise.\" \" I shall be happy to know the gentle man.\" There was an awkward pause. Twice had the physician thus intimated his de sire to be introduced to FeUx Heron. Heron, however, had just dismounted, and barred the way. But General Gaston knew no name to call him. \" No !\" he cried. \"Hear me, General Gaston. I think it will be prudent, until we know further of these affairs, that no person should be per mitted to leave your house.\" \" You are right!\" cried the General. \"I agree with your suggestion. By all means keep the door.\" And Heron was in doubt, under the circum stances, what name to give him, since, it will be remembered, his first introduction to the General was in the capacity of a highwayman , \" I am Captain Heath,\" he said, after a few moments' pause. The physician coughed slightly, as if to inti mate that he by no means beUeved that to be Heron's name. The servant actually fought with him for a few seconds in her anxiety to escape, and it was only by main strength that Heron forced her into a room leading from tho hall, and turned the key upon her. In fact, the pause that had taken place, and tho hesitation with which Heron had pronounced it, would have been quite sufficient to engender suspicion in any one. But the General took up the name instantly. \" Allow me, then, Doctor,\" he said, \" to state that Captain Heath is the dearest friend I have in tho world, and I am under infinite obligations to him.\" \" FoUow me !\" shouted the General. \" Tho person you have just captured is the personal servant of ' Ida. Follow me, sir, and wo will come at the heart of this mystery. Yet what am I doing? I have not your cool judgment. We need a nurse and a physician instantly.\" The General tore up the staircase as ho spoke, and Heron ordered Tom to look right and left, and see if a physician's door-plate was visible, and if so, to request his immediate attendance. There was much hurrying and scurrying iu tho General's house for the next ten minutes, with tho minute details of which we need not trouble our readers. The Doctor bowed. \" Allow me, now,\" said Heron, \" to take my departure. It is a great delight to me that I leave a happy atmosphere behind me, and at some future time I shall be glad to hear from you, General, tho solution of all the mysteries of this night.\" \" And I, too,\" said the Doctor. \" I was aware of the domestic calamity that had overtaken you, General, being so near a neighbour to you, although I had not the honour of attending your fair ward iu the illness the termination of which, But supposing those ten minutes to have passed away, we will look into a large and handsome drawing-room, where General Gaston is seated in company with FeUx Heron. \" Hope for the best!\" said Heron. \" The phy-"], [315, "309 EDITH HERON. !n a swoon, seems to have been mistaken for death.\" \" Sit down, both of you,\" he said. \" With pleasure, Doctor, but \" \" I Uke to see the end of everything, and after what this gentleman, Captain Heath, has told me, I felt myself justified in taking a step which I am certain you will both approve.\" \" What step, Doctor?\" \" Answer me first. You are sure your prisoner down stairs is secure?\" The General was about to make some reply to these words, when another tap came at . the drawing-room door. It was some one wishing to see the physician \u2014 the nurse, in fact, whom he had hastily sent for to attend upon Ida, and who brought word that the fair patient would not be quieted nntil she had seen the General. \" Quite,\" said Heron. \" There is .the key of the room.\" General Gaston glanced at the physician. \" Of course I consent,\" said the latter. \" The \" Good ! Then what do you think I have done ?\" shortest way is to humour a patient in these fancies, for the perils of contradiction are much worse than those of indulgence.\" The General hastily left tho room, and FeUx Heron was alone with the physician. \" Sh-,\" said Heron, \" we have a prisoner below in the person of the young lady's-maid, who, the moment she saw her mistress brought home, made a desperate attempt to leave the house.\" \"Then my suspicions are more than con firmed,\" said the physician. \" What do you suspect, Doctor ?\" \" That some one has administered to the young lady a narcotic drug of such potency that although it failed to destroy life, it threw her into that state of seeming death which has lasted so long.\" \" She had a bitter enemy !\" \" Which is further confirmation ! This affair must be well sifted, Captain Heath. Pray excuse mo for a few moments, and I wttl send for some one who will materiaUy assist us.\" The physician left the room, and during his absence General Gaston returned, looking radiant -with happiness. \" Congratulate me, dear friend !\" he said. \" Ida is not only weU, but \" A flush came over the General's face, and then he smiled with sincere happiness. \" Let me conclude the sentence for you,\" said Heron, \"and congratulate you upon your ap proaching union with your fair ward, who I am sure wUl be enviably happy.\" \" It is so \u2014 it is to be ! Oh, what a change is this ! I can scarcely beUeve in my own felicity !\" \" Such is life,\" said Heron. \" Hope and hap piness succeed despair ; and, alas ! too often, when we think ourselves securely armed against the shafts of maUce or misfortune, we stand in the most imminent danger.\" \" It is so \u2014 it is so ! But Ida has informed me of strange things !\" \" Doctor, you are quite mysterious !\" said the General. \"And something of an old woman, beside,\" thought Heron, to himself. \" Well,\" added the Doctor, \" not to keep you longer in suspense \u2014 ha, ha !\" \" In the name of heaven, Doctor,\" cried tho General, \" what have you done ?\" \" I have sent for Jonathan Wild.\" \"Who?\" cried Heron, starting to his feet \" Jonathan Wild, the famous thief -taker !\" \" The villain !\" \" Well, well, my good sir, I do not say for a single moment that Mr. Wild is an estimable personage.\" \"A mighty scoundrel, I believe,\" said the General. \" Well, gentlemen, weU, that may be ; but these kind of men, you see, have a sort, of tact in managing intricate criminal affairs, and I havo always heard that Jonathan Wild is on the side that pays him best.\" The General looked vexed. Heron caught up bis hat. \"Good night, General !\" \" Nay \u2014 nay \" \" Do not stay me \u25a0\" \" My dear Captain Heath,\" cried the Doctor, laying his hands upon him, \" you must stay. Did you ever see Jonathan Wild ?\" \" I think I have, once.\" \" I assure you he is a most remarkable man. I am visiting physician to Giltspur Street Compter. I quite long to introduce him to you.\" \" By no means !\" cried Heron. \" General, good night, again !\" \" Ah !\" cried General Gaston. \" Yes, yes ! Hang it, Doctor, what on earth has induced you to contaminate my house with the presence of such a scoundrel as Jonathan Wild?\" \" But, my dear sir, I thought \" \" Mr. Wild!\" announced a servant. \"Indeed!\" \" Yes, Captain Heath : she never wrote that letter about the jewels being carried to the tomb with her ! It was a rank forgery !\" \" I guessed as much.\" \" The villain Durban !\" \" Yes, General, you name the man ; and there can bo Uttle doubt but his accomphee in this house has been the own maid of your ward, Ida!\" The drawing-room door was flung open. With on6 bound, Heron passed through the folding-doors that led to the back drawing-room, and slammed them shut behind him. The Doctor was so astonished at this sudden movement, that he sUpped off his chair to the floor. General Gaston advanced a step or two, and Jonathan Wild stood in the doorway, glancing about him. \" By heavens, yes ! I will question her, and force a confession of her guilt ! Ah ! here is our friend the Doctor returned, and he shall assist us in unravelling all this guUty mystery.\" The Doctor walked into the room with a well contented smile upon his face. \" I think Doctor Fletcher sent for me,\" said WUd, producing a card from one of his capacious pockets. \" Certainly, Mr. Wild, I did,\" said the Doctor \"Something has taken place in this house"], [316, "EDITH HERON. 310 And easy, indeed, would have been Heron's evasion of the danger that beset him in General Gaston's house, but for one accidental circum stance. which I am sure ought to come under your cog nisance.\" \" Excuse me, sir !\" said General Gaston, with dignity. \" Doctor Fletcher, jyou seem entirely to forget that this is my house. I have not the slightest doubt but you are a well-meaning man, but give me leave to say that all this is trouhle pomely meddlesome in the extreme.\" \"Sir!\" Tne door opening from the back drawing room on to the landing from the head of tho stairs would have been quite a natural mode of exit for him. Unfortunately, however, it was closed, and some one had turned the key in the lock on the outside. \" I repeat my words!\" \" General !\" What was Heron to do ? \" That is my opinion, Doctor ; and as regards Mr. Wild, all I can say is that I do not require his services.\" Nothing but boldness would now save him. But if that were an element in the transaction, \" WeU, General, if this is the way my kind offices are received,\" said the Doctor, \" I will take my leave of you, and of Captain Heath, Ukewise; only I don't see him, for at the mention of Mr. Wild's name, he shot off like a rocket, either up the chimney, or out of the window, or into the back drawing-room, or somewhere !\" \" Ha, ha !\" cried Wild. his safety was pretty well assured ; for when did Felix Heron ever shrink from any act of whicli courage was the principal ingredient ? He made up his mind what to do at once. While the echo of Jonathan Wild's whistle still filled the entire house. Heron quietly opened the door leading from the back to the front drawing-room, and walked forward without the smallest hesitation. For the instant, Wild's attention was to the window towards which he had turned when summoning his myrmidons by the whistle. Heron had just time to sink into a chair some half-dozen paces from Wild, and there he sat profoundly still until Jonathan, turning his eyes upon him, seemed transfixed with mingled terror aud astonishment. CHAPTER CCLXXXIV. JONATHAN WILD IS MADE A PRISONER, AND CONVEYED TO THE C03IFTER BY HIS MEN. Wild stepped further into the room. The ordinary suspicious look upon his counte nance deepened into one of gloomy ferocity. \"What is the meaning of this?\" he said. \"Who is it that has mysteriously disappeared ?\" \" Captain Heath,\" said the Doctor. \"Captain who?\" \"Captain Heath.\" \" Bah !\" said Wild ; \" there is no Captain Heath, except he be of the road ; but of all your suppositions, Doctor, in regard to where this mysterious gentleman has gone, I prefer that that points to the back apartment here.\" Jonathan Wild made two strides towards the back drawing-room, but General Gaston was too quick for him, and gliding between him and the door, he drew himself up proudly, as ho glanced at the vulgar, ruffian-like figure before him. \"Hold, sir!\" he cried. \"I am the master of this house, and I neither sent for you nor will I tolerate your presence hero any longer !\" \" Then why was I sent for ?\" asked AVild. * That you may settle with your friend, the Doctor, whose services I no longer require.\" For a few seconds Wild seemed as though about to spring upon the General, and force a passage into thc back drawing-room. The significant manner, however, in which General Gaston handled his sword-hilt was something of a caution to Wild, and he adopted another line of tactics. Wild opened his mouth several times as if about to speak, and retreated backwards as he did so. \" This is Captain Heath !\" cried the Doctor. \"Captain\u2014 Captain Heath?\" gasped Wild. \"Captain Death, you mean!\" WUd had reached the door, which was par tiaUy open ; but as he did so, a couple of arms were flung about him, and he felt himself in the iron grip of Ogle. A blow upon the crown of his hat sent it at once so far down over his eyes, that, as far a.-. Wild could be cognisant of what was going on in that apartment, he might as well have been in the next street. Ogle did not utter a word, for he had no wish to be identified by WUd, but he made some gesti culations over the head of Jonathan Wild to Felix Heron. \" Goodness gracious !\" cried the Doctor ; \"what's the meaning of all this?\" \" It's only a little drama,\" said Heron; \"and it is called ' The Biter Bit; or, Caught in His Own Snare.' \" General Gaston started at thc sound of Heron '.s voice, which was so entirely different to any lie had hitherto spoken in, that it could scarcely be supposed to come from the same pei_on*8 lips. But Ogle was still busily engaged With Jona than Wild, about whoso face aud head he tied a. silk handkerchief so quickly and scientifically that he was completely hoodwinked, and at the mercy of circumstances. \"That roquelaire, Captain,\" said Ogle, now speaking for the first time. And Ogle had taken the hint from Heron, altering his voice so much that, particularly muffled up as he was, Wild had no chance of re cognising it. Suddenly stepping towards one of the windows, he blew a long clear note upon the whistle he always carried. The sound was so prolonged aud shrill that it was heard by every one interested in the pro ceedings of the great thief-taker. Felix Herou well knew that it was a signal to Wild's janissaries and bull-dogs to gather about the house. If he were to escape at all from his present predicament it must, bo done at once. Another moment, and Wild was wrapped up"], [317, "311 KDIT1I HERON. 'n one of the roquelaire cloaks, and perfectly helpless. The Doctor turned quite red in the face, as ho energetically protested against the proceedings. \" Gentlemen \u2014 gentlemen, this must not be. It is quite an outrage \u2014 this is Mr. Jonathan Wild, the well-known officer. This must not be, gentlemen ! General Gaston, I caU upon you to interfere.\" Captain Fantome of the royal navy, made his way once more to the house of General Gaston. In reply to his question as to whether the General could be seen, the servant ushered him into a room on the ground-floor, that same apart ment which Heron had converted into tho temporary prison of the maid of Ida. In a few seconds, General Gaston entered the room ; but upon beholding one whom he believed to be a perfect stranger, he merely bowed cour teously, and begged bis guest to be seated. \" Do you not know me, then ?\" asked Felix Heron, with a smile, as he held out his hand to General Gaston. Tho General 6hook his head. \" There has been a great deal too much inter ference already,\" lie said, \" and that of tho most unauthorized description.\" A confused bustle was at this moment heard upon the staircase. \"Is it possible?\" exclaimed the General, grasping Heron's proffered hand in both of his, \u2014 \" is it possible that any disguise could hide from my eyes the dear friend to whom I am so much indebted?\" There seemed to be some contention going on between General Gaston's servants and some persons who were forcing thpir way into the house. \" I am not surprised,\" laughed Heron. \"This same disguise, General, has stood the test of eyes who have known me much more intimately. But how is your fair ward ?\" \"Well \u2014 well \u2014 quite well; and, I hope, as happy as myself, Captain Heath ; for by that name alone I know you.\" \" Nay \u2014 nay ; to you I am no longer Captain Heath ; and it was as much for the purpose of telling you who I really am, as to inquire after your ward, that I hastened hero to-night.\" \" That is weU,\" said the General. \" I would fain feel that I am accounted by you as worthy of being ono of your dearest friends. Never theless, had you seen fit to withhold from me your confidence, I should still have been your debtor as long as I live.\" \" I know \u2014 I feel that my confidence will not bo misplaced. Have you ever heard of Captain Felix Heron?\" That these persons were Jonathan Wild's myrmidons Ogle felt perfectly assured ; and hold ing Wild by the collar, ho dragged him to the landing, while he called over the staircase balus trades, \" Mr. Wild orders a sedan chair.\" Several of tho janissaries\u2014 for such, indeed, they were \u2014 ran back into the street to procure one. \" Here's the sedan, sir.\" \" Mr. Wild,\" added Ogle, \" desires that this prisoner may be conveyed at once to the Comptei-.\" With a dexterity that only practice could have given him, Ogle, with a short piece of rope that he had in his possession, had effectually gagged Wild ; so that, with all the disposition in the world to yell and roar out his disapproba tion of the whole proceedings, the great thief tnker could only utter a low gurgling sound, which was very expressive of the last stage of strangulation. Ogle flung Wild, thus wrapped up and dis guised even from tho observation of his men, right into the arms of his janissaries. He was hustled into tho sedan chair, and car ried off at once in triumph. \" Often, often ; and not unfrequently has his name been mentioned to me with feelings of lovo and admiration by many a poor creature who has been a receiver of your bounty.\" \"Then you guess that I am he?\" asked Heron. \" Any orders, Captain ?\" said Ogle. \" Where is Tom ?\" \" Certainly.\" \" You are right, General. And now I tell you who Captain Felix Heron is.\" \" How ? Have you yet another name ?\" asked the General, laughing. \" Even so,\" replied Heron, mournfully. \" The proscribed Earl of Whitcombe.\" General Gaston fairly staggered back, as he re peated, \" The Earl of Whiti-ombe !\" \" Yes, my friend,\" replied Heron. \" But \u2014 but I thought it is believed that the Earl of Whitcombe is no more ?\" \"Minding the horses.\" \" That is well. General Gaston, good night; and as for you, Doctor, I warn you that, the least said iu matters of this sort is the soonest mended ; and if you value your own safety, you will be prudent enough to keep a still tongue in regard to the proceedings of this night.\" General Gaston stepped forward to Heron and took him by the band. a Let us not part thus,\" he said ; \" or I shall fear we part for ever.\" \" No, General ; we shaU meet again, and that shortly. I have need of friends, and have already a few, among whom I am certain you will be glad to be enrolled ; but, for the present, farewell!\" \" I know it. But, General, you will under stand my motives for lending myself to such a deception when I tell you that I have a child \u2014 a son ; and had 1 not aUowed myself to be con sidered dead to tho world, tho title and estates would have passed away from that child by an act of attainder.\" In the midst of a storm of indignant remon strances from the Doctor, Heron left the house, accompanied by Ogle. In two minutes more, he was mounted on Daisy, and making the best of his way towards Whitcombe House. It was on the evening of the next day that Felix Heron, in his carefully g\"t up disguise as \"Ah! I see-rl see,\" said General Gaston. \"But have you no friends at Court, Whit combe?\" \" Yes,\" replied Heron, \u2022' I have a few tried, sincere friends; aU of whom, probably, -you know. The Earl of Bridgewater \" \" Ah !\" inteiTupted the Generll ; \" I know him"], [318, "EDITH HERON. 312 well, and esteem him as one of my dearest friends.\" \" Colonel Trelawney and the young Marquis of Ormond complete the little circle of my friends,\" added Heron, with a faint smile. \" I know them all, I am rejoiced to say,\" said General Gaston. let this subject never more be mentioned between us. Tho woman whom you locked in the apart ment below was, as we both supposed, the accom plice of the viUain Durban. It was her duty to take my ward a cup of milk every night before retir ing to rest. On the night of Ida's supposed death, there is no doubt but that a powerful narcotic was therein administered by this wretched girl, for Ida teUs me that no sooner had she drank it, than she felt giddy and fell to the floor in that deathlike swoon, doubtless, from which we recovered her.\" \" And may I now add the namo of General Gaston to the list ?\" asked Heron. \"You may, indeed,\" replied the General, ex tending his hand to Felix Heron ; \" and beUeve me that you wUl not find me backward in doing all in my power to restore you to your rights.\" \" I know I may count on your friendship,\" said Felix Heron. \" But now, General, may I not see the fair Ida ; or am I to wait until she is the wife of General Gaston?\" \" No doubt \u2014 no doubt,\" said Heron. \" Now, General having satisfied myself as to the state of health of your fair ward, I wUl now take my leave, hoping that I shaU soon have the pleasure of introducing you both to the Countess of Whitcombe, who is most impatient to become acquainted with your ward.\" When Heron left the mansion of General Gaston, he made the best of bis way to Whit combe House, intending, as soon as he arrived again, to give his permission to Tom Ripon to have a night on the road. \" You shall see her at once, my dear friend. <!ome with me. I left her but now in the draw ing-room when Captain Fantome's card wa* brought to me.\" The General led the way up the grand stair case, and opening the door on the landing, a flood of light streamed out, lighting up every object with beauty. Seated at a table in the centre of the room was the Lady Ida, with her back towards the door, who said, without turning round, \" So-you have returned at last, truant. I have a great mind \" CHAPTER CCLXXXV. TOM RIPON HAS A NARROW ESCAPE, AND SLAYS HIS ANTAGONIST. \" Not to let me introduce to you my dear friend the Earl of Whitcombe, eh?\" said the General, playfully, as he led Felix Heron towards the blushing girl. \" Forgive my seeming rudeness,\" she said, rising and holding out her hand to Felix Hei>on.; for by General Gaston's manner his ward per ceived that the gentleman whom her guardian was so anxious to introduce to her was a very old and dear friend. Tom Ripon was busily engaged with Diisy, when he was startled by hearing FeUx address him. \"Well, Tom,\" he said, \" are you preparing to have a night on the road ?\" \"Well, Captain, I was in hopes that Daisy would be wanted for that purpose, although I must say I've been a Uttle bit afraid that, so sure as you have made up your mind to have a regular highwayman's night of it, there would be sure to come some horrid adventure or another to put a stop to it.\" Felix Heron raised the fair hand of Ida to his lips*is he said, \"I ought to apologize for in truding at so late an hour ; but I was very anxious to hear how you were after the exciting events of last evening, aud so ventured to call as early as possible.\" Ida looked first at her guardian, and then at Felix Heron, with a puzzled look. \" I will explain,\" said the General, taking Ida's hand in his. \" This gentleman, the Earl of Whit combe, is none other than the kind friend who so gaUantly assisted me in rescuing my Ida from her perilous situation in the tomb of Wood ford Church.\" \" You do not mean to say, Tom, that you re gret having saved that young girl from the horrible death which awaited her ?\" \"No, Captain, certainly not: and isn't she a beauty?\" \"Who?\" \" Why, the young lady that you wouldn't let anybody carry but yourself.\" \" Ah, Tom,\" laughed Heron, \" I see that yon are jealous of my attentions to the young lady.\" \" Well, Captain, if married men do all tho business that might be the means of recommend iug the single men to the hearts of beautiful, angelic \" \" Stop, stop, Tom ! Why, I declare you are getting quite poetical\"\" \"It's enough to make a man get poetical, Captain, when ho finds he hasn't a bit of his heart left in his bosom. I used to think that Martha was a lovely creature, but \u2022\" \" Well, Tom,\" said Heron, good humouredly, \" don't think anymore about General Gaston's ward, for she is going to bo married.\" \" Going to be married?\" \"Yes, Tom. Why not?\" \" Oh, nothing. Captain ; I ought to have known it, that's all. It's always the way ; as sure ai With one bound, Ida was by Heron's side, in an instant clasped both his hands in hers, but was too much overpowered by her emotions to articulate a word. The General, thinking that perhaps this scene might he productive of evil consequences to his fair ward, now said, playfully, \" Come, cheer up, my Ida. Let that be all forgotten. We have gained another friend ; let us make him welcome, Ida.\" Ida raised her beautiful eyes to Heron's, and said, in a sweet voice, as she took General Gaston's hand in hers, \" I can never make the Earl of Whitcombe aware of all that he has done for me. May heaven bless him !\" \" There is one thing which I may as well make known to you now, Whitcombe, and then"], [319, "313 EDITH HERON. care for me half so much as Daisy here does, so I'll have nothing to say to the fickle sex.\" \" Until the next opportunity, * Tom,\" added Heron. \" But now, Tom, if you feel incUned to go on the road to-night by yourself, you can take Daisy with you ; only mind you don't get into any mischief.\" \" AU's right, Captain. It's the only consola tion after being treated as I have been by Miss Ida.\" ever I make up my mind to make a young lady an offer, somebody else is sure to step in and cut me out. Who is she going to marry, Captain ?\" \" General Gaston.\" \" General Gaston !\" exclaimed Tom in a tone of incredulity. \" Oh, then I'U go in and try my luok with her. Why just look at me, Captain ! Young and not bad-looking\u2014 certainly not bad-looking ; and then think of that old pump of a General, old enough to be her father, or grandfather I might say ! It's perfectly absurd Captain.\" . \"But it's quite true, nevertheless, Tom; so 1 would advise you to look out for some one who does not happen to be engaged, and then I have no doubt you wiU succeed in gaming her affec tions.\" \" Hold, Tom ! \u2014 no more of this,\" said FeUx Heron. \"I must not have the young lady's name mentioned by you any more.\" Tom saw that Felix Heron was in earnest, aa he quietly busied himself grooming Daisy. Between nine and ten o'clock, Tom Ripon led Daisy from the stable, and equipped in his costume of a highwayman, mounted and rode away in the direction of Hampstead Heath. Tom shook his head wofully. \u00ab It's no use, Captain.

Whatever the elderly lady might have said to this speech was abruptly put a stop to by the foremost of the horsemen riding up to the coach and saying, a Did I not hear some oue call ing for assistance ?\" \" You did, sir,\" replied Tom, who had drawn closel}' around him a roquelaire cloak, with which he was provided ; \" and hearing that cry for assistance, I took the liberty of offering my ser vices to these ladies.\" Tom now drew rein and listened. Was he mistaken, or did he hear the crushing of wheels upon the hard roadway ? Nearer and nearer came the sound. \" All right,\" said Tom ; \" now for a breeze. I hope I shall be able to fill my pockets.\" Tom could see by the light of thc carriage lamps, as the vehicle approached, that it was an old-fashioned coach with a hood almost as large as that of a waggon, which was making its way towards him. \" Yes, yes ! that's it,\" shouted all the young ladies. \u00ab He's a \" \" You were somewhat nervous, it would appear,\" added Tom, lt from hearing that a high wayman has ju\u00a7t passed on this road.\" \" A highwayman ! Which road did ho take ?\" asked the first speaker. The coachman was in a faded livery suit, aud the horse came along lazily enough. With one bound, Tom was by the side of the vehicle, and resting his hand on the door, cried \" Halt !\" so suddenly, that the drowsy old coach man was so startled, that he pulled iu his horse with such force, that for a moment the creature rested on its haunches. Tom now looked in at the coach window, and was saluted by a series of little screams, which could only come from the lips of very young girls. \" Bother to it,\" said Tom to himself, \" they'ie only a lotos female kind; there's no credit in robbing them ;\" and added aloud, tl Good evening, ladies !\" u Straight up here,\" said the young lady, who was nearest the door, pointing in the opposite direction to the one they were pursuing. \"Let us away at once.\" said the one who seemed to take the lead ; and Tom Hipon had no difficulty in recognising them as officers of police. At a smart gallop they urged their horses on, and left Torn alone again with the coach and its occupants. \" Now, madam,\" said Tom, \" you tried to dv> me a bad turn, so I shall not let you off scot free as I intended ; so just hand over to me that gold watch and chain which graces your fair neck, or 1 may be compelled to help myself to it.\" \"Get along with you, yon masculine man,\" said a female voice from within the vehicle, which certainly did not belong to a very young personage, \"Get along with you, or I will call the watch.\" Again the young girls screamed, but this time it was in a lower key. \"Don't be alarmed, my dear girls,\" said Tom, \"I'm not going to harm you. Tell mo where you are going with this old virago?\" The old woman uttered a scream of rage, and one of tho young girls said to Tom, \" We are going back to school after the holidays, and this is one \" The elderly lady evidently thought that it would tc best to aecede to the demand, and quickly handed him the watch and chain, saying as she did so, \" Take it, you monster, and I hope 1 shall hear of you being hanged !\" 44 Thank you for your kind wishes, which, nevertheless, will, I hope, disappoint your ex pectations. Ladies, I have the honour of bidding you good night !\" As Tom raised his hat he galloped away, leav ing the discomforted elderly female in anything but a serene state of mind. \"Hold your tongue,\" interrupted tho elderly female. \" Miss Clare, you are a bold, forward girl, and as soon as 1 get home to Lawn House, J \" The night had become cloudy, and Tom was wondering what ho should do uext, when his attention was attracted by the sound of voices speaking in high tones. \" Go on, my dear,\" said Tom, who at this moment glanced uneasily about him, for clear upon the night air came the unmistakable tramp of horses feet. \" I tell you what it is,\" said a voice ; \" I have promised to ride over to the Grange to-morrow with tin se papers, and deliver them intothe hands of Lord Willoughby ; and once in possession of them, he will bo able to force the Lady Hilda to bestow her hand upon me.\"' \" True, true!\" replied another voice; \" but is hor fortune s.-ttled on herself?\" \"Yes; but after we are married I shall find means to induce her to make the whole over to me, her lord and master. A party oi liorscmcu now rapidly approached the carriage. Tom presented a pistol right, in tho face of the Coachman. \" Mercy, Mr. Highwayman \u2014 spare my life, and I'll give you my watch, which goes like St. Paul's, if you'll only spare my life.\" \" Be silent \u2014 utter not a word in reply to any question which may ho asked, and yon will save your own life.\" \"All right, sir.\"' \"James!

'Well.\" said Tom, \" my night's adventures have not brought me much gain, but there is yet time for some sport \u2014 eh, Daisy?\" Tom had gone some distance without taking much heed as to whither Daisy was taking him, and looking up, Tom, to his surprise, found that ho was riding just beneath a garden wall, the trees of which were branching out and extending far over the roadway. Tom reined in Daisy and held his breath, for he heard a sound which made his hair stand on end \u2014 a deep, prolonged groan, and then followed a piercing shriek from one of the rooms in the upper portion of the mansion, which he could just see through the trees. \" A highwayman, by Jove !\" said one of the gentlemen. \"Here goes 1\" As he spoke, he drew, a small di .63 sword, and made a dash at Tom, but missing his foot hold, slipped upon the soft turf. Bang went one of Tom's pistols. \" Take that, coward !\" cried Tom ; \" and now give me your purse!\" The bullet from Tom's pistol had disabled the sword arm of his antagonist, and Tom hoped that he should have but little further trouble. \" Tour money !\" again shouted Tom ; \" and be quick, or I will scatter your brains to the four winds of heaven !\" There was a deep groan from the gentleman whoso arm was disabled, and he sunk to the ground. \" Goodness gracious !\" cried Tom. \" What in the name of all that's horrible can that be ?\" Tom was not sorry to see that hp now only hud one enemy to contend against. At this moment Daisy made a plunge, and by that means, in all probability, saved her own life, for the other gentleman made a slash at her with his sword, and had the dastardly action been suc cessfuk Felix Heron would have had to mourn the death of his valued and much-loved Daisy. CHArTEB CCLXXXVL TOM MEETS WITH A STRANGE ADVENTURE, AND AN OLD FRIEND. Tom was debating in his own mind whether to ride on or not, when again the cry came upon his ears. Tom's young blood was heated by passion. Indignation flashed from his eyes, and seizing the other holstor pistol, he fired it at the head of the coward who had assailed the inoffensive animal. \"What shall I do ?\" asked Tom of himself. \" If the Captain were here, I know he'd go in and see what it was all a'bout : but then, he's not afraid \u2014 I mean he doesn't mind ghosts; and per haps I may find another girl like the General's ward, all laid out ready to be buried, covered with jewels from top to toe. And who knows but that I may yet find a lovely young creature, who will be only too glad to let mo carry her back to her father's house, just in the same fashion as the Captain carried Miss Ida ?\" \" Take that, villain!\" shouted Tom. There was a yell, half of pain, half of rage, aud the cowardly dastard fell lifeless at the feet of Daisy. \" Your blood be upon your own head !\" said Tom, as he dismounted, and knelt beside the companion of the dead man. Tom seemed to gather courago from this re flection, and he hastily tied Daisy to a lamp-post. while he scrambled over the wall just above a door, which he hoped he might be able to open without any difficulty on the inside. It was fortunate that the little gate was only secured by two heavy bolts on the inside; and, from their rusty condition, it was evident that gate was but little used. Tom was not many minutes opening. this gate, and, darting out into the lane, he led Daisy into the garden, and made her fast to the trunk of au elm tree. Tom was not, as we have seen during the progress of this veritable history, devoid of feeling, and ho was more shocked than he chose to confess, even to himself, at the result of his night's adventure. Kneeling down, then, by the side of the wounded man, Tom said, \"Are you much hurt, sir ? You forced me to do it.\" \" I know it! I know it! I deserve all I have met with. It might have been worse. Is that wretched man dead?\" \" As dead as a door nail !\" said Tom, after ex amining the man whom he had shot. \"The bullet must have passed through his head.\" \" And with such a load of guilt upon his head !\" groaned his companion. Just as he had completed these arraugements, Tom heard another shriek, and then a voice cried out in piercing accents, \u2022' Approach not nearer if you value your life, or you, too, will meet with the same horrible fate as he who now addresses you. Begone \u2014 begone, I say !\" Tom began to wish, himself well out of tho affair, but had some compunctious with regard to leaving the wounded man in his present situa tion. Tom stood irresolute for a moment. He thou remembered that he had discharged both Ida pistols in the lane ; so grasping one of them nervously, he commenced reloading it. This done, he performed the same office for the other, and placing them both in hiB belt, he made his way towards the house whence pro ceeded the cries, and knocking at a door which presented itself, he called out in an authoritative voice, \" Open \u2014 open, I say!\" All was still. \" Try to rise, sir,\" said Tom, \"and I will see you to a place of safety.\" \" No, no ! leave me,\" replied the wounded man. \" I shall do well in a few minutes, but leave me in peace and quietness.\" \" As you will,\" replied Tom ; and then he added to himself, \" I would rather it were you than myself in such company.\" Tom gladly mounted Daisy, and taking a hasty leave of his strange companion, he trotted off as"], [322, "316 EDITH HERON. \" I believe it's only a trick, after all,\" said Tom. \" I don't feel a bit nervous. I shall try to get in at one of the windows.\" There was a balcony to the windows on the ground-floor, and Tom had no difficulty in pull ing himself up by the iron railings, and finding one of the windows yielded to a touch, Tom was just in the act of jumping into the room, when the voice again addressed him : \" Beware ! If you approach another step, you are a dead man!\" \" Ah !\" exclaimed Tom ; \" Do my ears de ceive me? I should know that voice. Speak again, and tell me, whoever you are, if you re cognise me ?\" There was no reply, but Tom was now fully persuaded in his own mind that the voice which had just addressed him was none other than that of his old companion, Jack Sheppard, but why he should be enacting such a part, and in that house, Tom was at a loss to explain. As soon, therefore, as he had decided in his own mind that there really was no danger, Tom boldly proceeded in the direction of the sounds he had heard. of hearing his friend heave a deep sigh, and then he opened his eyes, and glared about him like one in a dream. \" Where am I ? \u2014 oh, where am I ?\" \" All's right !\" replied Tom's cheery voice. \" All right, old pal ! There \u2014 there, you look better now ! Take another drop, Jack, and tell me why I find you here in such a condition.\" Jack Sheppard raised himself, with Tom's as sistance, into a sitting posture, but refused to take another drop from the bottle, which Tom was so anxious he should empty, apparently. \" No, no, Tom!\" he said. \u25a0' What I've had has put new life into me ; but I am not strong enough to take any more until I have eaten something.\" \" What !\" cried Tom, in amazement, \u2014 \" what, in the name of all that's stupid ! do you stay here for, in such a ghostly-looking place as this, when you might have as much to eat and drink as you like at any of the old inns where you are so well known ?\" Jack shook his head as he said, \" I forgot, Tom ; you do not know I am badly wounded.\" \" Good gracious !\" exclaimed Tom ; \" I did not think of that. Where are you hurt, old fellow ?\" A few steps brought him to the door of a room, at which Tom listened intently; and he was rather relieved than otherwise by hearing a low moaning sound proceeding f rem some one within the chamber. Jack moved aside his vest, and then Tom saw what looked like a very ugly sword-thrust just above the region of Jack's heart. Tom placed his hand on the handle of the door, and entered instantly. Tom was not inexperienced, however, in these land of things, so he spoke cheerfully to Jack, while he busied himself in bathing with water the wound in his friend's side. The room was in profound darkness, but a stream of moonlight fell full upon the figure of u man lying prostrate on the floor of the apart ment. \"That'll do\u2014 gently! There! Soon be all right again ! Looks like one of Jonathan Wild's digs. There ! Eh \u2014 what ? Ho, Jack, don't be stupid now \u2014 don't go to faint like a girl ! Where's my bottle ?\" Tom seized his bottle again, and succeeded, with some difficulty, in pouring some of its con tents through the clenched teeth of his friend Jack. \" Speak,\" said Tom, \" whoever you are, and tell me why I find you here at such an hour, and why you give utterance to those unearthly shrieks. Are you ill? Speak to me.\" The dark figure raised itself on its elbow, and gazed upon Tom, and in a voice faint and weak, said, \" Tell me your name, and let me know if I have at last found one whom I knew in hap pier times.\" \" Before I answer your question,\" said Tom, who. was very much interested, \" let me ask you another. Is your name Sheppard ?\" \" Ah ! you know me ?\" \" I should think I do,\" replied Tom, rushing forward and throwing himself down by the pros trate figure of his friend ; \" and do you not know me, Tom Bipon ?\" Jack Sheppard uttered a cry of joy, and then fell backward in a swoon. Tom had to wait some minutes before the few drops he did succeed in getting into Jack's mouth produced their desired effect. At the end of that time, however, Tom had the unspeakable satisfaction of again seeing his friend open his eyes. \"Come, Jack,\" said Tom, hardly knowing what to say, \u2014 \" come, Jack, be a man ! You're better now, and when you can sit up, we'll both get upon Daisy's back, and I'll take you to some place of safety, where you will have better nursing than I can give you.\" Jack Sheppard made an effort, and succeeded in scrambling to a sitting posture, saying, in a voice more like his natural one than Tom had yet heard him speak in, \" I shall soon be all right now, Tom ; bnt how to get away from this place I don't know.\" \" We'll see about that,\" replied Tom, over joyed at seeing his friend look and speak so dif ferently to what he had hitherto done, \u2014 \" we'll see about, old fellow; but I can't make out whv you came to such a dismal-looking place as this. And now I come to think of it, I heard the most horrid, unearthly sounds in the world as I came through the garden, that I wonder at myself for having the courage to enter.\" \" I made those sounds,\" said Jack, faintly. Tom was alarmed. What could it all mean ? What was he to do ? \"Ah!\" he cried \u2014 \" my bottle. Ogle says it's a bad habit to carry a dram-bottle, but I don't think so. Didn't it save the life of that beautiful \u2014 no, not beautiful, because she's going to marry that old fellow, old enough to be her grandfather \u2014 but didn't a drop out of my bottle save her life ? And now I'll try what effect it will have upon Jack's.\" From one of the capacious pockets of his coat, Tom produced the dram-bottle, which had al ready had such happy results in Ida's case ; and gently raising Jack's head, he poured a few drops of tho eau-de vie into the lips of the insensible Jack. A few minutes, and Tom had the satisfaction"], [323, "317 EDITH HERON. \" You, Jack ? What on earth for ? I thought the place was haunted by ten thousand ghosts.\" \" Ah !\" said Jack, \" I'm glad to hear it.\" \"Glad to hear it? Why, what do you mean?\" \"Not told me what, Jack?\" \" I am going to give up my line of business \u2014 it's got to be too hazardous.\" \" And what do you mean to do, then, Jack ?\" \"Become a knight of the road, and cry 'Stand and deliver!' like you, Tom.\" \" Hurrah !\" cried Tom, slapping his friend on the back with such goodwill that Jack almost lost his footing. \" Glad to think I managed so well ; for, if I had not managed it so well, I should have been nabbed to a certainty.\" \"How?\" Tom flung his arms round his friend iu a moment, saying as he did so, \" What a con founded harum-scarum I am, Jack 1 I quite for got, in the delight of the moment, that you wore unable to stand such rough treatment just now. Here, take my arm again. All right ! I'm as steady as a judge now.\" Tom twined his arm within that of Jack Shep pard, and they both proceeded towards the door of the apartment which they had found was locked, and which they had lift some paces be hind them during their brief conversation re garding Jack Sheppard's contemplated change of life. \" Why, Tom, I was caught cracking a crib not far from here, but contrived to make my escape. I gave chase to the officers, and being a practised hand at such things I climbed over the garden wall of this house, which I knew to be empty, and succeeded in eluding pursuit.\" \u2022' But how did you get that wound ?\" asked Tom. \" In the scuffle that took place I had the mis fortune to lose my foothold, and then one of tho nabs thought he'd settle me then and there by giving me a dig in the heart.\" \" But you got off?\" interrupted Tom. \" Yes \u2014 yes, I got off ; and it was not till I got snug iu here that I was aware that blood was pouring from the wound. I just managed to place my handkerchief inside my vest, so as to staunch the blood, I suppose, and then I must have fainted.\" Jack applied the picklock, and soon they had the satisfaction of beholding the door turn gently with a creaking sound upon its hinges. The apartment which met their view was vast in extent, and was still partially furnished. \"Humph !\" said Tom, \" you've quite comfort able quarters here, Jack. I'd no idea you wero in possession of a furnished house.\" \" Nor I either,\" replied Jack. \" How cold it strikes !\" \" Poor Jack !\" said Tom. \" When I came to myself I was conscious of some sort of uproar \u2014 it might have been only in imagination, I now think \u2014 but when I at tempted to rise, my limbs, I found, refused their office.\" Tom glanced uneasily about him. \" Come, Jack, suppose we leave it. There i. nothing very inviting, that I can see, in all tins musty, frowsy-looking furniture. Let us go, Jack.\" \" What did you do then ?\" asked Tom. \" Why, I thought I would make those un earthly noises you heard, Tom, in order to scare away any one who might bo desirous of paying mo a visit.\" \"Nay! but I thought we were to explore,\" said Jack, with a smile. \" Yes,\" said Tom, \" and you almost succeeded in scaring mo away, I can tell you. for I never was, and never shall be, partial to ghosts.\" Jack laughed, and Tom was glad to perceive that his friend had nearly recovered his wonted spirits. \" But I have altered my mind now, Jack,\" said Tom, \" I see \u2014 I see there's nothing worth looking at. Let us come away.\" \" I should just like to see where that door leads to, Tom. Come along.\" \" What door, Jack ?\" \"Jack!\" \" Well, Tom \u2014 what now ?\" \" I should like to explore \" \"Explore? Explore what? What do you \" Why, that one at the end of the room. There, don't you see it is not quite closed ?\" Tom did look ; but as he did so, an unpleasant sensation of fear took possession of him. \" Stuff, Jack ! what is it to us where it may lead? Confound it! Only to another room, I've no doubt, in the same state of dilapidation as this. Come along, and let us mount Daisy, and be off.\" \" I must look into that room, Tom. Wait for me here, if you will,\" said Jack, disengaging his arm from that of his friend as he spoke. mean ?\" \" Explore this house. Who knows, perhaps, we shall find something worth having \u2014 eh, Jack?\" Jack shook his head incredulously. \" I think not,\" he said. \" However, I don't mind trying to accompany you, if you will lend a fellow your arm, Tom.\" \" Ay, that will I !\" said Tom ; \" and my legs, too, if necessary. Gently, now\u2014 here we go !\" Tom led Jack from the apartment in which they were, and proceeded along a wide corridor, which extended the whole of the length of the mansion. \" Wait here, alone, while you go there to be murdered, perhaps ! Not if I know it. If you must go, why, I'll come with you.\" Jack and Tom Kipon made their way along tho whole length of that apartment, and reached the half-opened door. Jack pushed it gently, and entering cautiously, closely followed by Tom, they were somewhat surprised to see the remains of a recent repast still upon the table, which occupied the centre of the room. There were doors opening from this corridor both right and left, and the two friends were in doubt as to whicli door should be first opened. They tried one \u2014 it was fast. \"Ha, ha !\" laughed Jack; \" I can manage that littlo business, Tom. I happen to have my pic lock with me. But that reminds me, Tom, I've not told you \" \" Tom,\" said Jack, turning round, \" we must be off, for I suspect we are not the only occupants of this house.\""], [324, "318 EDITH HERON. \"It looks like it,\" replied Tom; \"but look, Jack! Do you see anything more attractive than the remains of somebody's supper on the table ?\" with his heavy riding-whip, which so exas perated Tom that he stretched forward his arm, and grasped his antagonist by the throat, giving him at the same time so vigorous a shake that he nearly unhorsed him. \"By Jove, yes! I did not see them at first. I wonder if they are loaded?\" Jack and Tom approached nearer to the table, upon which lay a pair of beautifully mounted pistols. \" Why, Jack, they are the very thing !\" ex claimed Tom. \" Some good fairy must have placed them there.\" \" D.n't let us waste valuable time, Tom, upon such a ruffianly coward! I'll give him a bullet first, aud rifle his pockets afterwards,\" said Jack, at the same time producing one of the silver mounted pistols he had so strangely become pos sessed of. The horseman made frantic efforts to free him self from Tom's grasp, but this was a very diffi cult thing, for his arms had become entangled in the folds of an ample roquelaire cloak he wore, and consequently he was almost helpless. \" Are you going to murder me ?\" he asked, in tones of terror. \" Spare my life, and I will give you all I have about me !\" \" I don't know yet,\" replied Jack, \" whether it will be murder or not \u2014 that depends upou yourself. Who are you, and where are you going at this time of night ?'' \" That's my business,\" sulkily replied the horseman. \"Hem! They don't seem exactly the sort of things to be clasped by fairy fingers,\" said Jack ; \"nor do I think a fairy could have loaded them.\" \" Don't you understand what I mean, Jack ?\" said Tom, impatiently. \"I mean they are the very things for you, as you intend to go into another Jine of business.\" \"Ah, I understand! I will accept these pistols as a good omen of my successful career as a knight of the road. Now let us be going, Tom. There does'nt seem to be anything else worth taking, so we'll make the best of our way to the garden, where, I think I remember, you said you secured Daisy.\" \" All right ! Yes, let tis be going ; there's no telling but that the owner of the pistols may return, and dispute our right to their possession ; so the sooner we're off the better.\" \" Oh, that's your answer, is it, to a civil ques tion ?\" said Jack. \" IT1 find a way to make you speak very differently.\" As Jack said this, he touched the cheek of the horseman with the cold muzzle of the pistol. \" Help ! Murder !\" \"Silence!\" shouted Tom. \"Deliver to me everything you have about you, without another word ; or, as sure as you are alive now, you shall become food for the ravens before another hour passes over your head.\" In less than five minutes, Jack Sheppard, ac companied by Tom Kipon, stood beneath the wall of the garden, close to whicth Daisy was secured. Another moment, and they were mounted, and soon left the apparently deserted house far behind them. '\u25a0 There's my watch and seals,\" said the horse man, as he placed them in Tom's hands. \" And that ring \u2014 it looks like a diamond.\" \" Take it ; and now let me go !\" \"Not yet,\" said Jack. \"I have taken a fancy to tbat nag of yours. Dismount instantly !\" \"Never! This horse cost me a hundred guineas.\" CHAPTER CCLXXXVI1. TOM RIPON AND JACK .SHEPPARD PAY A VISIT TO JUiS. UIPON. When the two companions found themselves clear of the green lanes, Tom reined in Daisy, and asked tbe very pertinent question, \" What are we going to do, Jack?\" Jack was silent for a few seconds, and then he said, \" 1 wonder, Tom, if your mother has any thing in the way of a highwayman's costume that would suit me \u2014 eh ?\" \"All the better,\" said Jack; \"it had better cost you a hundred guineas than your life, which it assuredly will, if you make much more ado. I'll give you time while I count five. One !\" \"Hold!\" shouted tho horseman. \"You know not what you are doing, or who I am !\" \" Two !\" said Jack. \" Of course she has,\" replied Tom. \" I wonder I never thought of that before. There is a good suit of clothes that once belonged to a captain in the navy, or something of that sort, that would just do, except that they would be a trifle too large iu some places, and too small in others.\" \" Oh ! I won't stand out, providing I can get into them. I am able to use my arms and legs. What say, you, Tom, to coming with me at once to Wardour Street ; and then, if there's time, we'll go together and seek an adventuro ?\" \" All right, Jack ! I'm your mau. Let's push on, for the dawn cannot be far off. But what was that ? Did you hoar nothing ?\" \" I hear the tramp of a horse's feet, if you. mean that, Tom ; and here is the rider. Halt !\" \" I am an officer of His Majesty's \" \" Three !\" \u2022 The officer still seemed irresolute ; but Tom, who had never taken his eyes off him since he had grasped him by the collar, saw by the moon light that he had managed to get possession of the liaudle of his sword, which hung by bis side. \" Did you think we were as green as all that, now?\" said Tom, as he wrenched the sword from its scabbird. \"You'd bettei give in, for we are two to one ; and, moreover, we are well armed, while you have nothing to defend your self with.\" \" Four !\" cried Jack ; and again tho officer felt the closo proximity of the muzzle of the pistol against his face. With something Uke a yell of rage, the officer dismounted. As Jack uttered the word \"Halt!\" Tom reined in Daisy. \" Halt yourself!\" growled a voice; and at the iwmu time the horeeman made a slash at Daisy \" That :\u00bb well I\" said Jack, who, with Toms"], [325, "319 EDITH HERON. i \" I think, miss,\" 6aid Tom, \" matters are not so bad as you think, perhaps ; but it would .be some time before 1 could reach the house of any medical man. Let me try, with your coachman's asaistance, to right the chaise, and then he had better drive to the nearest house.\" \" Oh ! aunt, aunt ! Look up ! Speak to me ! Do not leave me yet !\" A bright thought came into Tom's mind. \" My little flask bottle \u2014 my little flask bottle '\u25a0\" The young girl removed her hands from before her eyes. \" What \u2014 oh, what did you shy ?\" \"All right! Here you are! Now she will be all herself in a twinkling !

And now, good-bye !\" Jack was soon mounted on the officer's horse ; and Tom was again in Dais-y's saddle, and they both trotted off at a brisk pace, nor turned their heads once to look at their victim, who was in anything but a charitable frame of mind, and was kicking and shouting till the whole air seemed filled with his outcries. \" Well, that was a good stroke of business, Jack,\" said Tom, as soon as they thought it safe t< i draw rein. \"Here you are, with a horse almost equal to Daisy, and a pair of as handsome pistols as you can desire, and all for nothing !\" Jack laughed. \" Shall we make our way to Wardour Street now?\" \" Oh, what is it ?\" asked the young girl. \" Brandy, miss \u2014 the very best that can be had ! Don't be afraid \u2014 you are quite welcome to it all ! It's not the first time it has saved people's lives !\" \" No, Tom ; I've altered my mind. With my horse and my pistols, I think I may manage to have some sport, even to-night, without troubling myself about my highwayman's dress. What think you, Tom ?\" \" I should think you might ; but I've had enough for ono night, so I'll just say good-bye, old fellow, and wish you good luck !\" \" Good-bye, Tom ! When we meet again, I will tell you what adventures I've had !\" Tom still pursued his way towards town; while Jack Sheppard turned his horse's head again, and seemed as though he intended to re trace his steps. \"Oh, thanks, thanks! \u2014 a thousand thanks!\" cried the young girl, as she eagerly seized the bottle, and with great skill dropped a small quantity of the liquor into the mouth of her aunt. Almost instantaneously the old lady moaned feebly. \" She lives ! \u2014 she lives yet !\" cried the young girl. \" Oh, what do I not owe you, sir ?\" \" Don't mention it, miss !\" cried Tom. \"You are quite welcome to it all, if you please. Sup pose I begin to get the chaise right, and then we'll place the old 'un \u2014 I mean, your dear, re spectable aunt \u2014 carefully inside, aud you can order your coachman to drive you slowly into town.\" There was a look of dissatisfaction upon the usually bright face of Tom Ripon when he found himself trotting quietly along the road ; and from the few words which he uttered aloud, it will bo seen that Tom was disappointed. \" Do so \u2014 do so ; and in the meantime, I will give my dear aunt a few drops more of this life giving liquid.\" Tom and the coachman now set to work, aud iu a few minutes the chaise was righted. Tom drew near to the young girl, who was still bending anxiously over the elderly lady, who, at the moment Tom approached, had opened her eyes, and was speaking in a low voice. \" That's what I call selfish ! As soon as he gets everything he wants, off he goes, without even thanking me for, perhaps, saving his life! Ah. well ! 1 suppose it's the way of the world !\" Tom still continued his onward course ; but lie had not proceeded far before a cry of distress fell upon his ear. \"Why, what sort of adventure are we going lo have now, Daisy, eh?\" A very few minutes sufficed to bring Tom up isi a scene which at once called forth all tbat was . hi.alrie iu Tom's disposition. \" My poor darling, I shall leave you alone and friendless ! I feel that the hand of death is upon me ! Oh, that I could have lived to place you in safety !\" A lightly-built chaise, drawn by a fine bay horse, bad been overthrown by something iu the sosid, which in the darkness the conchman had not seen, and a young girl was kneeling by the \u25a0 ide of an elderly lady, vainly endeavouring, by i aars and caresses, to restore her to sensibility. \" Can I be of any assistance, miss ?\" asked Tom, as he quickly dismounted from Daisy, \u2014 \" can I be of any assistance ?\" \" Ob, sir, if you would \u2014 if I might beg of you to fetch a surgeon ! I fear my dear aunt is killed !\" \" Oh, say not that you are dying, my dear, my only friend !\" sobbed the young girl, in ac cents that went straight to Tom's heart ; \u2014 \u25a0\" say not that you are dying, dear aunt ! All may yet be well !\" Tom coughed, in order to draw the attention of his strange companions. The young girl started. Then holding out her hand to Tom, she said, \" Dear aunt, be comforted! This gentleman has been the means of restoring you to consciousness ; and lie has kindly offered to place you in the chaise, with Robert's assist ance. You shall then be driven to the nearest house, where, with the assistance of a skilful medical man, and the blessing of providence. you will be able to continue your journey.\" The elderly lady shook her heai \" Tee late\u2014 -tee late,* my darliocf .bild > tHt Tom, at the moment, was at a loss what to do. He was not very anxious to show himself in his costume of a knight oi the road ; but he could not disregard the accents of entraaty and alarm in whkh he had been addressed by the voung bewg who still knelt by the insensible telta it fast aged ralstivt,"], [326, "320 EDITH HERON. It did not take long to accomplish the distance to Berkeley Square ; but Tom, who had secured Daisy to the back of the chaise before mounting the box, could not be said to pay any attention as to the course taken by the coachman, for ho was engaged during the whole of the drive in looking into the chaise at the beautiful girl whom he now verily believed would reign supreme in his too susceptible heart as long as. life re mained. let me see this gentleman who has so timely arrived to our assistance ; and let me speak to him, aud confide you to his honour and protec tion, should I die before we reach our destina tion.\" ''Oh, lor'! oh, lor'!\" said Tom to himself; \" the old lady is going to bestow the hand of her beautiful niece upon me, without even in quiring what or who I am ! I'm glad the Cap tain isn't here to step in and spoil all !\" The elderly lady raised her head from the bosom of her niece, where it had been resting, and looked at Tom long aud steadily. \" Do I see a highwayman ?\" she asked. Tom winced a little. At length the chaise stopped before a preten tious-looking mansion ; and, after some delay, a sleepy-looking hall-porter opened the door, de manding civilly enough who asked for admission at that late hour. \" Confound her !\" said Tom, to himself. \" What occasion was there for her to say that ? She's too knowing by half.\" \" Say Lady Clareville,\" said Agnes to Tom. \" Lady Clareville !\" announced Tom senten- tiously. \"Good gracious! At this late hour!\" ex claimed the hall-porter, as he sprung down the steps to assist the visitors to alight. Tom now assisted the hall-porter in convey ing the invalid to a room on the ground-floor, and then he turned to Agnes. \" Anything else, miss, in a small way ?\" There was a smile upon the lips of the young girl, who seemed to be somewhat amused by Tom's evident admiration. The young girl shrunk closer to her aunt, and looked somewhat alarmed. \" Are you a highwayman, sir ?\" again asked the elderly lady. \" I am here as a friend, madam,\" replied Tom, as he raised his hat in imitation of Captain Heron. \" I am here as a friend, and await your commands.\" The light from the carriage lamps fell full upon the face of Tom. \" It is an honest face, young man, that I look upon, and I would fain believe that the heart does not belie tbe face. Are you willing to undertake to escort us some few miles further, so that \" \" Only my best thanks,\" she rephed, holding out her hand to Tom. Tom took the proffered hand in his, and looked into the eyes of Agnes as he said, \" Good-bye, miss ! Shall I see you again ?\" \" If you wish to do so, certainly. We shall remain here some time, and we shall, of course, be happy to see one who has so materially as sisted us this night. Now, good-bye!\" Tom bent down and kissed the hand of the fair girl ; and then he said, \" I suppose I must be satisfied with that, eh, miss ?\" The elderly lady paused, and her head sunk again upon the breast of her niece. \" Have patience, dearest aunt ; 'yc-u. will soon be better, and then all will be well.\" Tom Ripon was now beginning to get in terested, and was by no means willing to forego the task of protecting the fair young being whose aunt seemed to be so prepossessed in his favour. Agnes nodded. In another moment, Tom was making his way towards Whitcombe House. \" You had better let your coachman assist me in placing you within the chaise,\" he said, ad dressing the old lady ; \" and I will then mount the box with him ; and I shall be most happy to escort you wherever you may wish to go.\" \" Thank you ! thank you !\" sobbed the young girl. \" Shall we return to Elm House, dear aunt ? Are you not too unwell to continue your intended journey?\" \"By no means,\" faintly replied the elderly lady. \"Go on to Lady Travers, in Berkeley Square, by all means, and then I shall die in peace, for you will be in safety, my child.\" \"Speak not of dying, dearest aunt,\" said the young girl. Then turning to Tom, she continued, \" If you will kindly go with us, sir, we shall feel greatly indebted to you.\" \"Don't mention it, my dear \u2014 at least, I mean, miss. I never was so happy in all my life before.\" CHAPTER CCLXXXY1I1. FELIX HERON AND TOM RirON TOGETHER SEEK AN ADVENTURE ON THE ROAD. The morning after the events detailed in our last chapter, and which had made a rather serious impression upon the somewhat too susceptible heart of Tom Ripon, Felix Heron delighted him \u2014 Tom \u2014 by the announcement that he should himself require Daisy on an expedition on the road ; and that Tom was to have her and his own horse in readiness to accompany him. \" Hurrah !\" shouted Tom ; \" I'm glad you're going, Captain, for it seems as though I should never meet with a right-down good adventure when I am alone.\" \" Sir !\" \" Oh, nothing, miss ! I was only saying that we had better be moving, as the old 'un \u2014 I mean your dear, respected aunt \u2014 might get cold.\" \" Agnes !\" moaned the old lady, as Tom, as sisted by the coachman, placed her in the chaise. \"Then you are not satisfied with your last night's expedition, Tom?\" interrogated Captain Heron. \" Satisfied, Captain ? Is it likely that robbing a parcel of women could give satisfaction to any one calling himself a man ?\" \"Well, Tom,\" said Felix Heron, \" we will see what we can do together.\" \" That's it !\" said Tom. \"I was longing to know what the angel's namo was. Agnes \u2014 oh, beautiful !\""], [327, "321 I EDITH HERON. \"What time shall we start, Captain ?\" asked Felix and Tom could keep folded around them the roquelaire cloaks with which they were pro vided. Tom. \" Ten o'clock, Tom.\" \" All right, Captain ; we will be ready.\" The evening set in with a small, steady rain ; A distant peal of thunder came upon their ears, and already the lightning began to flash from one end of heaven to the other, while the rain now descended in torrents. the clouds were dark and lowering. At the appointed hour, Heron found Tom at the little gate leading into the narrow street which ran along the back of Whitcombe House. \" Not a very inviting night for a ride,\" said Heron, as he sprung into Daisy's saddle ; \" but we will not be disappointed Tom.\" \" I think, Captain, there looks to be a break in the clouds already, and we shall yet have a fine night.\" ... \" This is pleasant, Tom !\" laughed Felix ;\" I can think of no expedient in our present dilemma than taking refuge in the haunted house, a little to our right.\" \"Good gracious, Captain!\" exclaimed Tom; \" for goodness sake don't think of it ! The people about here are scared out of their wits by the un earthly sounds that proceed from different parts of that old tumble down place ! Come on, Cap tain ; we shall find shelter somewhere, without disturbing all kinds of evil spirits. Come on, Captain \u2014 don't go there !\" \" I am sorry, Tom, to disoblige you,\" answered Felix Heron shook his head incredulously, and gave the rein to Daisy ; and, at a sharp trot, took his way towards the Oxford Road. They had proceeded some distance, when the wind changed, and it was with difficulty that No. 93.\u2014 Edith Heron."], [328, "322 EDITH HERON. Heron ; \" but I have often had a fancy for ex ploring this very house ; and it seems to me that chance has directed me here this evening. Never theless, Tom, if you prefer taking shelter under these trees \" that terrace. Felix Heron broke one of those windows, and noiselessly entered the house. \" Here I am!\" was Felix Heron's first excla mation. The first thing he did then was to run against a chair in the room, which gave an ominous creak upon the collision. \" Oh, as for that, Captain, I'm not afraid. If you have made up your mind to go in, why, of course, I'll go too ; but I think it much better to leave such folks to themselves. Not a sound came upon his ears, and the room was so profoundly dark that, as for seeing anything, he might as well have been in a dungeon. \" Folks, Tom ? Why, it has been uninhabited for years past ; you mav be quite sure we shall encounter no folks.\" \" Ah ! What is that ?\" \"Well, Oaptain, I mean ghosts; for, of course, only ghosts live in haunted houses.\" Felix Heron smiled as he drew up before a little gate, nearly concealed by the thick growth of ivy which had formed an almost impassable barrier to any one who wished to effect an en trance by that same littlo gate. Felix Heron soon, howover, tore down suffi cient of this natural screen to enable both himself and Tom, with their horses, to enter the garden of the deserted mansion. Felix Heron knocked his head against some thing that gave him rather a sharp rap, and then feeling out carefully in front of him, he found that it was a key in the lock of a door. The fact is, Felix Heron had been so afraid of tumbling over anything, that in his progress through the room he had, as people are apt to do when they are uncertain what obstacles may bo in their route, stooped considerably, until his head came on a level with the key. But that httle accident did not disconcert him much. It was intensely dark, but Felix Heron con tinued his way, cautiously followed by Tom Ripon, with tbe horses ; and in a few moments lie had the satisfaction of knowing, by the gritty tread under his feet, that they were upon a gravel path. The rain was still coming down, but it was not so heavy as it had been, and by the shifting character of the wind that kept coming in squally puffs, it was pretty clear that a change in the weather was at hand. \" Where there is a key there is a lock,\" said Heron ; \" and it strikes me forcibly that by its size, it is in a door.\" Felix Heron was not mistaken, he felt round about where tho key projected, aud found the handle of a lock. He turned it, and at once opened tho door. A footstep, close at hand, fell upon his ear, and Felix begau to ask himself if he had been seen ; but, hearing the footsteps taking an opposite direction to the room in winch he found himself, he felt somewhat reassured. Felix Heron went on fearlessly enough through the garden, and he felt quite satisfied that he should come to a house soon. Moro than onco he diverged from the path, and got upon what had once been tho turf edging of the flower-beds, but the soft tread always warned him of that, and he, followed always by Tom leading the horses, regained the path again. Suddenly, upon making an abrupt turn, he saw, standing in bold relief against the night sky, a large and dusky-looking house. Felix Heron, as soon as the footsteps had died away, came cautiously out of the room and looked about him, and seeing a staircase just opposite, he . lightly sprang up it, and was soon upon the landing of the upper storey of the man sion. He then crossed the landing, and entered a room, the door of which was partially open. The room in which Felix Heron now found himself, was one that was dimly lighted by a lamp hanging from the ceiling immediately over the table, upon which was laid a rich but small repast of cold meats, wines, and pastry. From a window in the upper storey there gleamed a faint, ray of light. Tom darted forward, and touched Felix Heron on the arm. \" Look there, Captain !\" \" Where ? Can you see any of the ghosts ?\" \" I think it very likely that that light pro ceeds from a room iu tho occupation of one of them.\" Felix Heron glanced about him to see if there wero any possible means of hiding himself in that apartment, if such a precaution became necessary, for he knew not how soon the person ago whose footsteps he had heard on first enter ing the mansion might think proper to begin bis supper, for Felix had no doubt but that that re past was prepared for that individual. \" Ah !\" exclaimed Heron, \" I had not observed it, Tom. Wo will go and see who is keeping watch so late.\" \" Not for the world, Captain !\" cried Tom. \" I'll wait here with the horses, and be in readi ness, if you should want me.\" \" As you will,\" said Felix Heron. \" I must find my way into the houso somehow. I fancy thero must bo all sorts of windows and doors to such a house as this, aud it will bo hard indeed if I don't get in at some of them.\" In that apartment there were no means of con cealment, but he saw, however, that there was a door in one of its sides, partially open. To make towards that on tip-toe was the work of a moment. Ho went into the adjoining room. It was fitted up as a bed-chamber, aud upon a table was a small hand-lamp. A largo bed was against ono of tho walls, the hangings of which wero drawn ; but, still on tip toe, Felix Heron advanced towards it, impelled by a curiosity he could not resist. He gently drew aside the curtains. Upon the bed lay two beautiful girls \u2014 children in years evidently \u2014 locked in each other's arms. There was a kind of lawn in front of thc house, and Felix Heron, in a stooping posture, walked quickly across the lawn, and reached tho house. There was a terrace running along half the frcai of it, and a range of windows opened upon"], [329, "323 EDITH HERON. \"What can be the meaning of this?\" said Felix, half aloud. \" What can such children as these do in tliis deserted mansion ? I wish they would wake.\" The door of tho room, with the windows opening on to the terrace, was only slightly closed: a touch with Heron's foot soon opened it sufficiently for him to pass through with his light burden, and in another moment he took them across its threshold. At these words, one of the children opened her eyes, and then she looked at Felix Heron, and placed both her hands together in an attitude of prayer. No doubt at tho moment catching but an imperfect view of Heron, whose back was to wards the lamp, she took him for some other per son. They none of them spoke for some few mo ments ; but, having placed the eldest of the two children on the floor, Felix Heron felt with his right hand before him, moving it about, so that they should not \u2014 as he had dono when he was in that room before \u2014 encounter sharply any of the furniture. \" Oh, have mercy upon us ! Take us back to the school, where, at least, we were contented ! Oh, spare us \u2014 spare us ! and heaven will bless you yet, and forgive you the past !\" Felix stepped forward, and clasped both the girls' hands in his, as he said, in his own gentlo tones, \" They shall kill me before they shall in jure either you or your sister, as I presume her to be. Don't be afraid, I will protect you both.\" With a faint scream of joy, the child clung to him. He knew that if he made his way right across the floor, ho must come to the windows ; and ho was rather surprised that through them he did not see the night sky. \" Some one must have closed the shutters,\" ho said, in a low voice. \" You, Amy, stand down, dear, close to your sister, and I will soon open ono of them.\" \" Yes, yes ; I will.\" He quitted his hold of the children, and groped his way to one of the windows. It was, as he supposed \u2014 the shutters of them had been closed ; and it took Heron some few moments to find the fastenings of them in the intense darkness that reigned within the apartment. He did so at length, however, and with great care removed an iron bar. \" You are not, then, in my step-father's ser vice. You will befriend us, then ?\" she asked. \" Tbat will I,\" answrcrcd Felix Heron. At this moment, the other sistor moved un- easily, probably disturbed by tho little conversa tion between Felix Heron and the elder one. \" Wako up \u2014 wake up, Amy dear ! Hore is a friend who will take us back to Ullesthorpe.\" Amy sat upright in the bed, and gazed doubt inply upon Fen*. Heron. The shutters, then, were easily opened, and through tho windows he saw tho drifting clouds ; and amid tho moving branches of the trees ho could perceive the dim outline of Tom Ripon and the horses. \" Will you not make friends with me, little one ?\" asked Felix. \" I am going to see in what way I can serve you both ; but in order to do so better, I must know who has placed you bore, and for what reason.\" \" That is soon told, sir,\" replied the elder of the two children. \"Our deal, kind father died about a month ago, leaving the whole of his pro perty to our mother, little imagining that almost as soon as he was dead she would marry Mr. Sharpies. As soon as he married our mother, she made over all the property to him, and we could see that we were regarded as standing in his way ; so one night, after pretending to be kinder to us than usual, we were brought here under pretence of being taken for a drive ; and here be has kept us ever since, only giving us just sufficient food to keep us alive. Oh, how much we \" \" Hush !\" said Amy. \" What is it ?\" asked Felix Heron. CHAPTER CCLXXXIX. FELIX HERON AND TOM RIPON MEET WITH AN ADVENTURE ON THE KOAD. The light tbat now fell faintly into the room showed Felix the two children, looking more like spectres then aught human ; but he could not go to them then, as he had the window to open, and that was a delicate and nervous thing to do, as it would make a slight creaking noise, in spite of all his care. Felix Heron was fearful \u2014 not for himself, but for those fair, innocent beings whom he hoped to rescue from the cruelty aud tyranny of their cruel step-father \u2014 lest that aslight creaking noise should be heard amid the silence of the night by that person to whom the footstep he had heard be longed, and whom he doubted not was the step father of his two protegees \"He comes!\" she cried. \"Oh, we are all lost!\" \"Not yet. Do not say a word ; I will get behind this great easy chair.\" Felix Heron remained some time in his place of concealment, and then ho whispered softly, \" Whoever it was, he's gone down stairs again. Can you not manage to dress yourselves, for I have made up my mind to take you both home with me ?\" It did not seem, however, as if such were the case, for he got the window open far enough fair himself and the children to easily creep out, and no one came. The two children gave a scream of joy. Felix Heron again retired behind the great easy chair ; and he could hear that the toilette of these two innocent beings was satisfactorily pro gressing. \" Now, my dears \u2014 now !\" he whispered. \" Yes \u2014 oh, yes, dear sir !\" exclaimed both the children in a breath. They tottered to the window, and Felix Heron helped them out on to the terrace. Amy's dress threw something down that was leaning against one of the trellis-work supports of the canopy over their heads. FeUx stooped to feel what it was, and found Perhaps Felix Heron never felt more unalloyed happiness than at the moment when he raised both the orphans in his arms, and commenced the descent of the stairs."], [330, "324 EDITH HERON. that it was a fowling piece, with two barrels to it. There could be no doubt but that the man who bad been prowling about the house had placed it there before entering. \" There's no saying what use this may be to me,\" thought Heron to himself. \"At all events, I will not leave it here to be used by its owner.\" Then turning to the two children, he asked them if they could walk quietly across the garden to where they could see two horses and a boy. \" Yes \u2014 oh, yes ! The fresh air is so reviving after being so long confined in that close room,\" said Florence, the elder of the two. \" Come, then,\" said Heron, leading the youngest by the hand, while the other held the fowling piece. \"Keep close to me, Florence, and you will soon be free and in safety.\" The children were, as Florence had said, con siderably strengthened and encouraged by find ing themselves in the open air, and they now almost ran from that gloomy house, which they believed, and believed truly, was to be their grave as well as their prison. but I demand the right of claiming my dear children at your hands, whoever you may be.\" \" Never more will you have the chance of im prisoning them in yonder deserted house. By a decree of Providence my steps were this night directed hither for the purpose of exposing your villany, and forcing you to make restitution, as far as may be, for the past. \"Never!\" roared the man, as he rushed past Heron, and was clasped tightly in the arms of Tom. \" Now, then, old 'un !\" said Tom ; \" you might as well say, another time, when you're coming this way, and I should be prepared.\" So unexpected was his capture, that the villain remained perfectly passive in Tom's arms until Felix Heron came up, but seeing that the man was unarmed, he (Felix) placed his pistols in the holsters again, and then came to release Tom. \" Now, sir, are you anxious to try who is tho better man of the two, now it has come to a trial of strength ?\" The children had lost all thought for them selves now that they saw their brava dehverer closing with their cruel step-father. \" We will return \u2014 we will return with you, Mr. Sharpies!\" shrieked Florence, \"if you will not injure that gentleman ! Let me go, sir !\" Tom had enough to do to keep his hold upon the generous girl, without hurting her, but Felix Heron's voice re-assured her. At the rate they went, the distance between the mansion and the back wall under which Tom Ripon was taking charge of the horses was soon traversed, and they dashed into the flower beds, close to the old ivy that grew right up from that spot in such luxurianie. \"Tom!\" \" Captain !\" \" Help me to get these little girls mounted as quickly as possible, for we must off and away ere it is too late.\" \" Do not be afraid, my dear. I cannot come to any harm from such a man as this. Now, sir!\" Whatever reply Tom Ripon might have made to this order was lost to Felix Heron, for at that moment a blaze of light came through the trees, and a man with a large stable lantern ap peared, rapidly approaching the spot where they stood. Mr. Sharpies had been gathering strength during the brief conversation between Florence and Felix Heron, and as the latter finished speaking, he twined his bony fingers in Heron's cravat, who, but for his agility, must have fallen a victim to this treacherous attack. Perhaps they might have succeeded in mount ing the horses and distancing their pursuer, if the children had not in their agony of apprehen sion uttered a scream, that of course immediately attracted the man's attention, and he cried out in a loud, harsh voice, \" Ah ! just in time ! If you, either of you, stir another step, it shall be your last !\" In another moment it was Felix Heron who had his adversary at his mercy, drawing him backwards, intending to fasten him to a staple in the door of an outhouse, which was only a few yards from the spot. \" Hold ! stop ! mercy ! You know not what you do !\" shrieked the helpless villain. Felix Heron was at a loss to conceive what such outcries could mean, for up to this moment the man had shown no want of courage. Too soon, however, the truth slashed upon him, and he had just time to save himself from a horrible fate. \" Tom !\" said Felix. \"Yes, Captain?\" \" Take charge of these children, while I settle accounts with that villain.\" \"Oh, he will kill you! He will kill you!\" shrieked both tho childrn eat once. The cruel step-father had disappeared ; and as Felix Heron, with difficulty, disengaged him self from the falling man, he could now under stand the meaning of those dreadful shrieks for mercy. Felix Heron did not stop to hear more, but hastily snatching his pistols from the holsters in Daisy's saddle, he walked to meet the man, who was rushing onwards liko some wild animal in search of its prey. The light of tho lantern carried by Mr. Sharpies, the step-father of the two children, fell full upon the figure of Heron, and displayed at the samo time tho two barrels of his pistols pointed at his head. Mr. Sharpies was dashed to pieces at the bottom of a stone quarry in bis own grounds. \" It was no use, Captain,\" said Tom, when Felix Heron reappeared upon the spot where he had left his young follower in charge of the two little girls, \u2014 \" it was no use. I could not per suade either of them to mount until they wero assured of your safety.\" \" Havo you sent him away, sir ? Will he let us go with you ?\" asked Amy. \" Most assuredly he will never interfere with you again,\" replied Felix Heron. \" But now let The effect was instantaneous. The man came to an abrupt standstill. \"Have a care!\" shouted Felix Heron. \"Both these pistols are loaded, and their contents shall find a place in your brains if you come another step forward!\" \" I don't want to come another step forward,"], [331, "325 EDITH HERON. us mount instantly, and I will take you to my house, unless you would rather go anywhere else.\" stood apparently all about it, brought the beauti ful creature to the side of the carriage. \" Your money and valuables, if you please,\" said Felix. \"To your house \u2014 oh, to your house ! We have no friend but you. Our mother no longer loves us, or she would not have allowed that man to treat us in such a manner as he did.\" There were two gentlemen in the carnage, and as Felix uttered these words, he was answered in a voice the tones of which he knew too well. \" Be it so, then,\" said Heren ; and taking Amy on the saddle before him, he told Tom to do the same with her sister, who, to judge from the readiness with which Felix Heron's orders were carried out, was not averse to the arrange ment. They were those of his half-brother, Lord Warringdale. \" Take that !\" Bang ! went a pistol, as he at once fired it with the full intent of lodging the bullet it had con tained in the brain of Heron. Fortunately, the bullet flew some six inches aside of his face and that of his helpless young charge. Proudly and gently the gallant Daisy cantered into the high road that led to London. Felix Heron drew rein suddenly. \" What's that ?\" he said. \" Listen !\" Another moment, and the barrel of Felix Heron's pistol rested on the edge of the coach panel, as he said, \" Now, sirs, your lives, as well as all that you have of value about you !\" \" No, no ! Oh, do not murder us !\" shrieked Warringdale. \" Quick, my Lord Warringdale, or it may be a bad night's work for you !\" \" Ah, you know me, villain !\" For one moment the recollection of all that he had endured, and was still likely to endure from Lord Warringdale, came over Felix Heron, and a strong desire to avenge himself by taking his life at once came over him, but it was only for a moment. \" What is it, Captain ?\" \" Do you hear nothing ?\" \"Hush! The sound's approaching!\" said Felix. Felix now backed Daisy close to the hedge on one side of the road, and then he waited, with a pistol in his right hand, for the approach of the carriage, the grating of the wheels of which upon the road came more distinctly to his ears every passing moment. There was the crack of a postilion's whip \u2014 the tramp of horses' feet \u2014 and then, at a turn in the road, there came into view a chariot drawn by a pair of handsome grey horses, one of which was ridden by a postilion. The postilion was a mere youth. The moment for action had come ; and, stoop ing down, he whispered to Amy, \" Fear nothing, my child ; no harm shall happen to you !\" \" Not with you \u2014 not with you !\" was the art less reply. The carriage came on ata rapid rate. Tom Ripon hid himself completely behind a tree, and was doing his best to reassure Flo rence. Even that pause, short as it was, would, to his mind, full of high and noble feelings as it was, have converted the act into murder. He could not do it. \"Villain,\" he said, \"I know you, and your life is at my mercy ! That I do not take it is because I am not, as you are, unscrupulous, mur derous, and with the heart of an assassin !\" \" Ah !\" \" It is contamination to parley with you. Had you the rewnues of that earldom you would fain usurp, with you, I would wrest from you every coin. Quick, my lord, quick ! I will not brook delay. False brother \u2014 false man \u2014 ignoble wretch, who, with wickedness beyond all human villany, aim not what you seem to be to the world \u2014 I demand of you your money, and all that may be money's worth about you !\" Lord Warringdale's eyes flamed with rage ; aud he turned white and cadaverous-looking with concentrated wrath. \"Oh, they will kill him\u2014 they will kill him !\" she almost shrieked. \" Nonsense ! It's only some friends of mas ter's coming along in that carriage, and he's going to speak to them.\" \"Oh!\" Felix gave one touch to the bridle of Daisy, and, with a leap, the creature was in the very middle of the road. The horses of the carriage were not above thirty paces from that spot. \" Stand !\" cried Heron, in a strong, high, clear voice \u2014 \"Stand!\" \" Oh ! give him all ! \u2014 give him all !\" \u2014 cried his companion in tones of affright. \" That is wise counsel, John Tarleton : I trust you will follow it yourself, when your turn comes.\" The postilion drew the rein of the horse he rode, rather instinctively than from any desire he had to do so, and the carriage swerved, owing to the other horse not obeying with the same quickness the impulse to stop, and was partially swung round towards the hedge. \" Stand !\" shouted Heron again. \" Another step, and your life is lost !\" \" Murder !\" cried the postilion, as he saw that Heron levelled a pistol at his head. \" Oh, good Mr. Highwayman, don't shoot me ! Lor' bless you, I'm only a poor fellow !\" \" Still ! Keep still ! On your life !\" added Heron. There was evident fear about the bad heart of that man of iniquities ; and he was, in vain, en deavouring to subdue the shaking of his hands. \" Take what you want, then,\" he said, \"and let me be free of your presence.\" He held out a pocket-book, which from its bulky appearance seemed to be well filled. It was in his right hand that he so held it. And Heron did not see that his left was busy iu a pocket of the carriage, where he had another pistol and which he thought he should be able to use with deadly effect the moment the high wayman, as he thought him, should turn away from the vehicle. Another touch to the rein of Daisy, who was quite at home in what was going on, and under-"], [332, "326 EDITH HERON. 1 But my Lord Warringdale was foiled in the perpetration of this little piece of treachery. There was a sudden shadow cast into the coach, and from the other side au arm was projected through the window, and the voice of Tom was heard. The porch of the old inn was huge and deep ; and as Tom Ripon crossed the threshold, a kind of shudder came over him, he knew not why. But he shook it off ; for although bis vigorous and rather untutored fancy strove hard to make him superstitious, his endeavour to emulate Felix Heron in all things would not allow him to give way to the feeling. Tom, as we know, was rather inclined to be su perstitious, and, for the moment, he called this shudder that came over him at crossing the threshold of the inn, a presentiment of some thing wrong about the place. At all events, he did bis best to forget the un comfortable impression that had come over him ; and having assured himself of the safety of Daisy by locking her stable door, and placing the key in his own pocket, be felt somewhat reas sured \u2014 especially when one of the most motherly looking women in the world came forward, saying, \" Are you wet, young gentleman ? Pray, sit down by the fire, aud make yourself at home.\" \" Oh, dear, no, my lord! that won't do at all.\" Tom, with Florence still grasping his horse's mane, had made bis way up to that other side of the coach, in order to reassure his trembling companion that Felix Heron was in no danger, and had, therefore, heard and seen all that had passed; and now he pulled Lord Warringdale's hand out of the pocket where the other pistol was ; and so suddenly was this done, that ho (Warringdale) had no time to let go of the stock of the weapon, and he brought it out of the pocket, but only dexterously to be snatched from his hand by Tom, who, as he got hold of the barrel, dealt Warringdale such a crack with the butt of it, on the top of the head, that he half fell back, confused and stunned by the blow. \" He's a treacherous vagabond, Captain ! Take the plunder, and let's away.\" Tom dexterously rebeved Warringdale of his watch, seals, rings, and then Heron turning to John Tarleton, said, \" Now, sir, it is your turn !\" With a pistol, the barrel of which felt cold and deadly against his cheek, there was not much difficulty with the cowardly John Tarleton, from whom Heron took a full purse and a roll of papers. \" The fact is,\" replied Tom, now perfectly at his ease, \" I rather missed my way, owing to its being so dark a night ; so, if you will allow me to stay here until the storm has passed away, I shall be greatly obliged to you, and will pay you well for the accommodation.\" The landlady of the \" White Horse,\" as the little inn was called, was most profuse in her offers and attentions, and Tom began to feel quite delighted to think he had fallen into such capital hands. \" Stop! They are useless to any ono but the owner. Give me those papers, and take every thing else I have.\" To Tom, one word of kindness was a com plete passport to his heart, and he never knew when he had said or done enough in recompense for it. \" I will take these as well as everything else,\" coolly replied Heron, as bo placed the papers in one of the pockets of his coat. Little did Felix Heron think that those papers so nearly concerned his interest. But we will not anticipate. \"Help! \u2014 help!\" cried the postboy, at this moment. The landlady now turned, and left the room, after wishing her guest \" Good night.\" The room in which Tom found himself was the kitchen, or common room of the inn, where tho people who kept it sat ; but, by some mys terious means, the only person left in the house now appeared to be the landlady herself, and thus Tom was able to account for being quite alone. The landlady had taken the only candle, but yet the wood sire that burnt upon the hearth shed a sufficient light about it to emit a slight glow over the quiet old room, and every article in it. Tom felt very tired, and his eyes were half shut as he gazed upon the fire, when suddenly he heard a deep sigh in the room. The sound was so clear, and so startlingly earnest, that Tom, in a moment, sprang to his feet, saying, \" Who's that ?\" He had heard tbe sound of horses' feet on the road. Another moment, and Felix Heron and Tom Ripon had both ridden onwards at a smart gal lop, and were soon lost to sight in a curve of the road, as it wound down the hill. In another half-hour, the children, pale and jaded, were seated beside Edith on one of tho sofas in the drawing-room of Whitcombe House. CHAPTER CCXC. All was as silent as tho very grave; but a strange fear now suddenly crept over him, for i.i the distance of the apartment, whicli was but partially lit up by the rays from the wood fire, he saw \u2014 or fancied he saw \u2014 the dim outline of a figure, and it was actually moving along the Ws.ll. TOM RIPON MEETS WITH A SINGULAR ADVEN- TURE AT THE \" WHITE HORSE.\" The night succeeding the events detailed in our last chapter set in wet and dreary, but that did not prevent Tom Ripon availing himself of Cap tain Heron's permission to make use of Daisy, and seek his fortune on the road. Tom, as we have said before, was naturally superstitious ; and such an appearance as this, being, as it was, so very evident to the senses was enough to appal any one. He kept his eyes steadily fixed upon it ; and indeed, if ho had wished ever so much to do so, he would have found it impossible to withdraw the gaze, which was fastened upon the object by The wind blew in wild gusts, but still Tom trotted on ; but when he found himself in a lonely lane, and a heavy storm evidently at band, he hailed with delight the sight of a little roadside hostel, hoping there to find shelter until the storm had blown over."], [333, "327 EDITH HERON. a kind of fascination that overcame every other seeling. \" Oh, fool, fool !\" cried the landlady. \"Confusion!\" said the voice; and then the rough-looking head was as suddenly withdrawn again. How long a time the figure took to move along tbe wall Tom had no means of knowing, but when it got to the foot of the stairs, which opened from the room, it paused, and he heard a low, soft voice say, \" Beware ! \u2014 oh, beware ! Danger ! Death ! Death !\" \"Upon my word,\" said Tom, his courage rising with the emergency, \" this is a very nice sort of house ! I wish you would explain to mo what is the meaning of it all ?\" \" Oh, dear ! oh, dear !\" groaned the woman. \" Yes, it's all very well to cry, ' Oh, dear !' said Tom ; but I want to know what is the meaning of it all ?\" \" I will tell you,\" replied the woman, making an effort, \u2014 \" I will tell you, sir ! The fact is, sir, my son is a little wild, and it's only when be thinks there is nobody hero that he comes to get a trifle from me to keep him, for ho has been poach ing in the neighbourhood, and he is afraid to show himself in the daytime, the dear fellow.\" \"Oh, indeed!\" said Tom. \" Yes, poor fellow ! That's the real truth.\" \" Then, that was tho pi or fellow with the great head of hair, and who didL' seem to have taken the trouble to shave himself for the last six weeks, who just now popped his head into the room ?\" Tho figure then seemed to ascend the stairs, still keeping the face towards him, and rather to tloat up than to walk, and, finally, it disappeared, leaving Tom so bewildered and terrified, that he was quite incapable of speaking or moving for some minutes. The first thing he did, when he recovered himself sufficiently to do so at all, was to rush to the staircase, and cry out aloud, \" Hilloa ! \u2014 hilloa ! Help !\u2014 help ! Who is there ?\" A flash of light camo upon his face, and he saw the landlady coming slowly down the stairs looking as if nothing were the matter. \" What do you want ?\" she said. \" Did you call?\" \" Yes, I \u2014 that is, I think I did. It is no thing !\" Tom staggered back to the seat he had been occupying before, and sank down upon it, look ing as white as a sheet. \" Good heavens !\" cried the landlady, \u2014 \" what is the matter? What has happened to you? Are you ill ?\" \" Oh, no, no ! I Nothing !\" was all Tom could gasp. \" Yes. Alas, yes !\" moaned the woman. \" Well, I wish you joy of him !\" said Tom. \" I suppose the poor fellow is his mamma's darling ?\" \" One can't help loving one's own flesh and blood, you know, and he is as like his poor dead father, sir \u2014 who is now a saint iu heaven \u2014 as one parched pea is like unto another.\" \" Then his father must havo been a remark ably handsome man, ma'am, I should think,\" said Tom. \"But what explanation have you got to give about the ghost \u2014 that is what I want to know?\" The woman shaded the candle with her hand, and, as she shook in every limb, sho said, in a strange whisper, \" Did you see anything?\" \"Ah, that's it!\" said Tom. \"You know something of it ?\" \" Oh, no, no ! There is no apparition hero !\" said tho woman, turning as pale as Tom him self. \" That I know nothing about, indeed, sir,\" re plied the woman ; \" except that it once appeared to me when I was darning the stockings of that poor fellow, sir, you saw just now, and whom you were good enough to call haudsome.\" \"And pray what did you say to the ghost when it paid you a visit ?\" asked Tom. \" Of course, sir, I screamed and fainted dead away, and since that time I know nothing of it whatever.\" \"But I tell you there is, and you know there is ! I saw it ! A figure, in a strange, grey look ing dress, that went right along the wall yon der,\" said Tom, \"and then mouuted those very stairs you just descended ! You must have met it ! Is your house haunted ?\" The woman shook so much, that she was com pelled to place the candle upon the table, or it would have fallen from her hand, and then she tottered to a seat, aud stared at Tom for some few minutes in silence, as if he, too, had been something not of this world. \" Well, it's an odd thing,\" said Tom ; \" but of course you cannot be answerable for a ghost taking it into its head to come to your place.\" \"Did it \u2014 did it say anythiug to you, sir?\" fal tered out tbe landlady. \" What's the meaning of it all ?\" said Tom, excitedly. \" Are you out of your mind, woman, or am I mad ? How is it that your house, of all others, has got a ghost in it, and that it takes the first opportunity of appearing to your guests, to terrify them out into the night air at once, as many people would go ?\" \" I know nothing,\" was the reply. \" But you have seen it, woman ?\" said Tom. She shuddered from head to foot, as she said, Tom thought it best not to tell the woman tbe words that had come to his ears from the lips of the supposed apparition ; and as the strange being had certainly said more than one word, Tom ex cused himself very well for the little deception he intended to practise upon the landlady. \" Not one word,\" he said, iu reply to her question. The woman seemed greatly relieved at the news that it bad not spoken to him, and evi dently got much more composed iu conse quence- \" Once \u2014 once only ! I think if I were to see it again it would bo the death of me !\" She covered her face with her hands, rocking herself backwards and forwards for a few mo ments; and then, beforo she took them away, the door of the room was opened, and a head Mas thrust in, while a rough voice said, in sup- l times, \" Is it all right?\" \" I hope, sir,\" she said, \" you will not let anything that has happened here to-night dis turb you. You will soon go to sleep and sola, t all about the ghost ; and I feel quite sure there will be no complaints from you in the morning.\""], [334, "328 E1UTII HERON. rent of her ideas, she said, suddenly, \" Oh, very well ! Of course, sir, it is just as you please, sir. I will leave you this Ught. Good night, sir!\" Tom thought the last words of the landlady had a very strange significance in them, and accordingly he began to get anything but easy. \" Very good,\" he said, assuming what he was very far from feeling, a careless air ; \" very good. Where is my room ?\" \" Up-stairs, if you please, sir ; and if you are so inclined, I will show it you at once.\" The landlady rose with such alacrity, that it seemed as though she were delighted at the thought of getting rid of Tom for the night ; but he pretended not to take any notice of the fact, and he rose too, and followed her to the staircase, up which she rather hastily ascended. CHAPTER CCXCI. MORE MYSTERY. A STRANGE VISITOR. THE PISTOL-SHOT. With these words the landlady immediately turned and left the room, and Tom Ripon was left alone to his reflections, which, it must be ad mitted, were none of the most cheerful descrip tion. \" You will be as comfortable as possible, sir ; and I am quite sure will have never slept so soundly as you will here.\" \" That's quite a comfort,\" said Tom, \" for I am dreadfully tired, and I dare say I shall sleep like a top.\" \" This way, sir \u2014 this way, if you please,\" said the woman, still hurrying on. They had by this time reached the landing of the stairs, and a long, gloomy-looking passage that seemed to ran along the whole length of the house. \"Well,\" he said, when he could no longer hear the footsteps of the landlady, \u2014 \" weU, this is about the most mysterious inn I ever stopped at in all my life. I wonder, now, if that was a ghost or not that I saw in the room below, glid ing along so very mysteriously. The worst of it is, ghosts are never clear and expUcit about what they come to tell you ; but they rely so much upon your powers of guessing, which, in nine cases out of ten, is decidedly wrong. Ah ! what's that?\" Tom slew towards the door, and was about to open it and look out to satisfy himself that all was right, when he made the rather disagreeable dis covery that ho was a prisoner, the door being locked on the outer side. It was to the right of this passage that the landlady conducted Tom, who stopping suddenly, said, \" Where does that passage lead to ?\" indi cating the one to the left. \" Oh, sir, only to a few rooms which are seldom used, unless, sir, the town is very full.\" \" Well, I thiuk I should prefer sleeping there,\" replied Tom, \" because it must overlook the stables.\" At the moment that, without a doubt, this con viction came over him, Tom felt a pang of dread upon Daisy's account, but certainly none for himself ; and he mechanically put his hand to his pockets to feel for his pistols. It was a consolation to find that they were safe; for while he was weU armed, he, at all events, held the Uves of some of his enemies in his power. \" Oh, certainly, sir,\" she replied, \"if you pre fer it ; but you will not be near so quiet there as you would be here.\" \"Never mind,\" said Tom; \"I have a fancy for them ; so show me the way.\" She opened a door that led into an old fashioned, gloomy-looking room; but there was no vestige of a bed to be seen. The landlady drowned Tom's thoughts, for she said, instantly, \" Tbe bed is in the inner room, sir, if you please.\" \" Oh, this'll do,\" said Tom. \" I see that there is an old sofa in this apartment, and upon that I will lie down and take what rest I require, without undressing, as I want to be off by day break.\" After thus finding that the door was really locked on the outside, Tom made a vigorous effort to open it, and effectually convinced him self, at length, that there was no chance of breaking it open, as it was most frightfully strong. \"Very good,\" he said to himself; \"IwiUdo the best I can, if I can't do just what I would.\" Tom thought it best to await the course of events, and not give any indication that he was awaro of the fact that he was a prisoner, so he retired from the door, and began to consider what he had better do next. \" What ! upon the sofa, sir?\" \" Certainly, ma'am. I have slept many a time upon a sofa, and I don't see auythiug extraor dinary in it at all.\" \" Oh, but, sir, for the honour of my house I cannot allow a gentleman to pass the night on a sofa. You must, indeed, sir, conform to tho rules of the house, which is a most respectable one, aud go to bed in a Christian-like manner!\" \u2022' Oh, indeed !\" said Tom. \" Then I tell you that here I shall remain, whether it be against your rules and regulations or not. But as you are so particular, who is to know that I pass the night hero instead of going to bed, unless you inform them? I will have a light, too, if you . please, ma'am ; so no more nonsense.\" He was anxious now to discover if there were any other mode of leaving the room, except by the door by which he had entered ; but, although he glanced carefully round the apartment, he felt confident that there were no means of egress. Tho fireplace was enclosed by a chimney-board, but Tom did not disturb it, as it would have re quired much more urgent circumstances than those iu which he now found himself, to thiuk of getting up the chimney. Tom had just finished this investigation, when he heard a singular tapping sound in the inner room, and snatching up the light, he rushed into tho bed room. The landlady seemed upon the point of say ing something very angry; but, as if some new thought bad entered her mind to change the cur- The rapping sound continued, as Tom made his way into the inner-room ; and, holding"], [335, "329 EDITH UElto: the candle high above his head, in his left hand, he grasped one of his pistols with his right, as he said, \" What is it ? Who is there ?\" AU was stiU in the apartment, and he could see no one \u2014 although he strained his gaze into every corner of the place. Tom began to fancy tbat he should see the ghost again, perhaps ; and that this was the mode by which it was pleased to make its presence known. Tom had no difficulty whatever in tracing it to some window in the room. Setting down the light upon the table, he went at once to the window, and shading his eyes with his hand, he at once saw something like a human face behind one of the panes of glass. This was rather a startling fact, for, after aU, Tom thought it might be some sepulchral-looking being he had seen in the apartment below, but he was rather desperate this time. The fact of the locking of the door of the apartment upon him by the landlady had too much impressed Tom with the idea that there was more of human than supernatural agency at work in the matter, to permit superstitious fear entirely to get the better of him, and he at once made an effort to open the window. It did not require a second to let him see, and feel, both, that whoever was outside was holding the window down against his efforts to open it, This thought, it must be confessed, produced a kind of terror as he looked about him ; for what human breast can preserve its usual calmness when it believes itself to be in the presence of some being of another world, the capabiUties and powers of which are all unknown. It was a relief to Tom to see nothing. \" That knocking must have been a matter of imagination,\" said Tom ; \" it can't be real, or I should Ah!\" Tap ! tap ! tap ! came the sound again, and No. 94. \u2014 Edith Heron."], [336, "330 iSDITII nERON. and men a voice from without said, \" Gently \u2014 gently !\" will have no objection to say who and what you arc, and what you want?\" \" I am the orphan niece of the landlady of this house, and I want to save you*- life. That is my errand now.\" Tom nodded, although, probably, his visitor from the outside could not see tbe action very weU, and then, with great care, so as not to make any noise, he opened the window, and the person who was outside mado no sort of opposi tion to his doing so, which proved to Tom that ho was right in tbe translation he had put upon the word \" Gently!\" and that it did indeed apply to the opening of the window with as little noise as possible. \" Sa/ve \u2014 my- \u2014 life?\" asked Tom. \" Yes \u2014 you are in a house where you will be murdered if you are not put on your guard. There has been one murder here already since I have been in this place, and I was so terrified and shocked at it that they shut me up, and have made me a prisoner ever since ; but I was deter mined to seo you if I could, so I watched my opportunity, and have escaped to come to you. But Jonathan Wild \u2014 that good Jonathan Wild will be here soon, and then all will be well.\" If Tom Ripon bad paused, only for a moment, to think about the matter, the whole affair would have seemed so very mysterious to him that, pro bably, he would have hesitated very much before ho went so far as to open the window, but tho rapidity with which he acted prevented him from having any fear. Intense interest and curiosity in what was going on was the only dominant feeling in his mind on tho occasion. \" Humph !\" said Tom. \" There may be two opinions about his goodness. But teU mo more. I can scarcely understand why they wish to murder me.\" \" I fear I am confused,\" replied the girl, \"but I cannot tell you any better than I have done. I was brought here to assist my aunt and ber son, and they thought I could be frightened into hold ing my tongue with regard to their viUanous proceedings. But I will tell the truth. Thej murder every one who stops here.\" \"Murder them?\" The moment he succeeded in opening the window, Tom found that the person outside it was a female. \" Good gracious!\" exclaimed Tom ; \"who are you ? \u2014 and what do you want here ?\" \" Hush ! Oh, do not speak above your breath, for the love of heaven !\" said the femalo ; and, by the voice, Tom felt quito convinced it was a young girl who addressed him. \" Help me into the room at once. I am standing upon a ladder, and am afraid of falling off !\" \" Oh, to bo sure \u2014 certainly !\" said Tom. \" I have not the slightest objection !\" \" Yes, they do indeed, but it drives me nearly mad to think of it. They shut me up in one of the old rooms, and only give me enough to eat just to keep mo alive \u2014 and tliat little is of the very coarsest and worst description of fpod \u2014 because they began to fear that in my horror 1 should tell of their proceedings-\" \" But bow came you to be able to convey a letter to Jonathan WUd, if you were locked up?\" asked Tom. And ho at once assisted tho girl into the apart ment, and then she hastily closed the window and sank into a chair, and began to sob as if her heart would break. \" I succeeded in flinging a letter addressed to him into the road, from the window of the room in which I was confined, when some one was passing, and in addition to Uis name on the letter I wrote these words : \u2014 ' Please to post this.' And by the person who picked it up nodding his band I knew that it would be done, and then I felt some degree of satisfaction.\" \" Hem !\" was all that Tom could reply to this very unsatisfactory communication. \"I am sure he wiU attend to it,\" added the girl, \"for I have read in the newspapers what a won derful man Jonathan Wild is.\" While she was thus singularly conducting her self, Tom was able to take a good look at her, and see what she was as regarded appearance, and he came to the conclusion that her age did not exceed fifteen \u2014 possibly she was younger, but she was very pale, and appeared to be in a great state of excitement, and dread of something or somebody. \"For goodness sake,\" said Tom, \"what, is the matter ? \u2014 and tell me if you are the, ghost ?\" \" Oh,. do not ask me!\" she sobbed; \" I only hope he will be here soon ;\" disregarding alto gether Tom's last question. \"Who?\" \" WeU,\" said Tom, \" it may be very consoling to you to have written to Jonathan WUd ; but it is not so to me, for I happen to know him, and when we meet we never agree.\" \" Oh, how sorry I am for that !\" said the girl ; \"for I am sure he must be a very nice person. lie is always hanging highwaymen, and such bad people.\" \" Goodness gracious me !\" said Tom. '' 1 always expected to hear a great many funny things as I got on in life, but among them I never expected to hear any one say that Jona than WUd was a very nice person.\" \" Is he not so, then?\" \" Rather the reverse,\" said Tom ; \" but this is not. tho time to settle tbe character of Jonathan Wild. Let us leave this house at once, which which you tell mo is such a bad one. But can you give me any proof that I may trust you ?\" \"Alas, yes!\" \" Jonathan Wild.\" \" The deuce !\" \" Oh, no ! I mean Mr. Wild, who they say catches all tbe thieves, and is so very active. I read about him in a newspaper, so I thought that the best thing I could do was to send for him, and I wrote the letter early to-day, so he will be sure to be here soon.\" \" Well,\" said Tom, \" if he only comes while I am here, I shall hardly be able to express my obligations to you. He is, of all others, the most delightful gentleman to meet that I know ! But t \"11 me, did you climb up a ladder aud get in at this window on purpose to toll me that?\" \" Oh, no, no !\" \"Well, that is some consolation,\" said Tom, half-amused, and greatly perplexed as to how all this would finish. \" And now, perhaps, miss, you"], [337, "EDITH HERON. 331 \" Why do you say ' Alas, yes !' \" asked Tom. \"Because the proof that I can give yon of the truth of what I have told you is such a horrible one that I dread to show it to you.\" \" What is it ? Tell me at once \u2014 he quick !\" \" Oh, yes, sir, I will tell you ! There is a large cupboard in the other room, and if you open the door you will see a sack, and in it a dead body I\" heard footsteps in the passage outside the door. and the rattle of the key in the lock. * Lost ! lost !\" Baid the young girl. \" Not quite,\" replied Tom, as he stood calmly facing the door with a loaded pistol in his right hand. In another moment there came a flash of light from the corridor, and the door was opened. \" A dead body !\" gasped Tom. \"Yes, it is a frightful and a melancholy truth. You have only to look to convince yourself in a moment.\" CHAPTER CCXCII. \"Just wait here for me,\" said Tom, \" while I take a peep. I won't keep you long.\" Tom snatched up the light and hurried into thc next ruom. TOM RIPON AND ELLEN ARE PURSUED BY JONA- THAN WILD. A rough-looking head was projected into the apartment. Tom gently opened the door of the cupboard, and at the moment a huge sack fell into the room, and bursting open, disclosed to his horrified gaze, the head and hands of a dead body. Tom now made his way back to the room where he had left the girl, who was still weeping and wringing her hands ; for as yet she had great fears that both Tom and herself would be murdered in that house. Bang ! went Tom's pistol, and the head was immediately withdrawn again, and the light that had flashed into the room disappeared. A lumbering noise down the stairs proclaimed that the head, and the body that belonged to it, was descending those stairs with much greater expedition than they came up. lt Nowforit, dear one !\" said Tom. \"Open the window as wide as you can, and let us be off, for we don't know how many there may be in readiness to come to this fellow's assistance.\" At the sight of Tom she appeared to gain a Uttle more courage. She said, \" Oh, sir, it is you who must save mo now ! I have no hope but in you !*' Ellen was deathly pale, and she stood by the window trembling so much that it was quite clear she would not be able to descend the ladder without the greatest assistance \" Don't say another word,\" said Tom. \" It is you who have saved mo, brave, courageous girl. if you could manage to get up to this window by the aid of a ladder, as you did a little while ago ; the ladder is still there, and we can surely de scend by it; so let us come away at once, for this is anything in the world but a desirable place for us to remain in.\" With a faint scream of joy, the young girl clung to Tom. \" You will befriend me, then ?\" she asked. Tom, however, preserved the most perfect self-possession that it was possible to assume, and approaching the window, he said to the young girl, \" Come, dear, pluck up courage, and descend from the window. It is but a few steps, and then we are safe.\" \" I will try, Tom ; but you will come at once ?\" \" Assuredly I will.\" Ellen began the descent of the ladder, while Tom followed so closely that she did not let go her grasp of his hand during the whole descent, and, in a minute.or two, they were on the ground in safety. \" To be sure I will !\" said Tom. \" Didn't you risk everything to save my life, and do you think I will be less generous ? It will be a joy, in deed, to think that I have saved you from these dreadful people ; for, do you know, I love you dearly already. What is your name, dear?\" The young girl blushed as she spoke, and said her name was Ellen; but Tom placed his arm r nind her waist, and drawing her close to him, kissed her, saying as he did so, \" Perhaps this is the hist kiss, after all, that I may be able to give you, Ellen. Bless you, dear! I shall always love you ! You must call me Tom I\" \" Oh, do not fancy, Tom, that I am un grateful !\" Her lips just touched his cheek, and moved slightly. It was like the flutter of a little bird upon his face. \"Ah, Ellen!\" said Tom: \"if I were to live for a thousand years I should never love any one but you. It was my fate to meet with you, and to think there is no one in all the world like you. I am quite sure there is not, either, you beautiful, dear Ellen.\" \" Hush ! oh, hush ! they may hear us !\" \"Ah! I had forgotten, dearest; we must be Miiick. for Jonathan Wild may be here, and then \"Come! come!\" said the young girl. \"This way \u2014 this way !\" \" Stop a bit,\" said Tom. \" Where's the stables?\" \" Oh, never mind the stables!\" \" But I do, though,\" said Tom. \" I am not going to leave Daisy here. She goes with us, or I do not go at all. Don't you fancy there is aDy great risk in that determination. Only show me the way, for I don't know it in the dark. For the love of heaven, be quick !\" \" Come, then, if you must.\" The young girl laid hold of Tom by the arm, and led him hastily across a portion of the garden in which they were now, and in a minute or two, by turning an angle of the house, they came upon the stables, and Tom then knew exactly where he was. The fact was, tho window from which they had escaped had opened upon a part of the little kitch en-garden, and he had not before been to that side of the house at all. 14 Wait for me half a minute,\" said Tom. \" I did not unsaddle the horse, so I shall be with you again directly. Don't stir.\" V should be lost.\" They now approached the window; but, just ns Tom had opened it again, they distinctly"], [338, "EDITH 1IEU0N. 332 \" Oh, Tom, I hear footsteps ! They are coming!\" said EUen. \" Let us both hide in the stable!\" As she spoke, sne ran into the stable, whither Tom had just gone, and it was not a minute too soon that she did so, for the landlady came along the garden like a madwoman, crj ing out, \" Where are you, boys ? \u2014 where are you ? Oh, my poor son is murdered! He has killed him \u2014 that he has! Come and finish the job, or he may get away, and then it is all ud with us ! They havo killed my dear son !\" \" Halt !\" cried a voice, and they all stopped, in a straggling kind of mob, for there was about a dozen of them. \" Who are you?\" added the voice. \" Travellers on the road,\" said Tom. \" I hope you are honest people.\" \"We are the police, and we want to know whereabouts the ' White Horee Inn ' is upon this road. Perhaps, young sir, you can inform us?\" \" You will see it a few paces down the first turning you come to on your right,\" said Tom. \"A lantern here!\" growled a fierce voice. \"I must see who these good folks are, before I let them go by me so easy. A lantern here, quick!\" It was Jonathan Wild who uttered these words. There was a rushing sound, as of people break ing through the hedge, and then a voice said, \"What! has he got his deserts at last? I thought he would some day. He was always so mighty fond of cutting a throat by himself, and it was only to get more of the share of the plunder, nothing else, for he always pocketed something before we came in for any of the affair.\" \" Oh, we won't trouble you about the lan tern,\" said Tom. \" Our names are Smith, and we belong to the great famUy of the Smiths, of Smith Hall. \"Come, come!\" again screamed the woman. \"He is a young body, and we can sell it well. The doctors will give a good price for him. Come and finish the job, lads, for my poor son is breath ing his last in the kitchen.\" The men who were called lads by the land lady went hurriedly past the stable door after her, thus narrowly escaping Tom and his help less and terrified partner in the adventure. But even while the great danger was apparent, Tom had not lost a moment in feeling that Daisy's harness was all right ; and as soon as the voices had died away in the distance, he led Daisy into the garden. \"Oh, let us go \u2014 let us go!\" said the young girl. \" The very air of this place seems as though it would kill me. Let us go at once, Tom.\" \" Yes, dear. Can you ride on horseback ?\" 41 Alas, no ! But I will try. I will do any thing in the world to escape from this place.\" Tom mounted, and then assisted Ellen to do so, and then off they went out of the garden into the high road. The clatter of the horse's feet was evidently the first intimation that those who were in the inn had of the escape of the fugitives, and then one of the \" lads \" ran to the door and called out, 44 The gun, Ned ! The gun ! Bring me the gun ! There they are, and they will be off if you don't be quick!\" \"They?\" screamed the woman. u Who do you mean by they?\" 41 Why the young chap and our Ellen.\" The landlady threw up her arms, and with one shriek fell senseless to the floor. Tom now gave the rein to Daisy, and away they went at such a gallop that Wild was thunderstruck at the moment, and let them get considerably ahead before he could recover from his surprise. \" After them!\" he shouted, in a voice hoarse with rage. 4* After them ! Shoot them ! \u2014 shoot them ! Anything but let them go ; for I do be lieve it is that young villain, Tom Bipon. I'm sure that's Daisy.\" The pursuit now began in right earnest, and Tom and Ellen soon heard the clatter of the armed men coming after them Jonathan Wild and his company had gained considerably upon Tom in that short space of time. Still Tom had confidence in Daisy, and he had confidence too in his pistols, which he had found means to load again, so that he by no means despaired of the result of the affair. \"Come, Johnny,\" said Tom, \"since you seem bent upon it, we will have a race. I don't pre tend to have any clue as to where this road leads to, but at all events it is a good one, and there don't seem to be any obstruction, in the way, so now for it.\" With these words, Tom put Daisy very nearly to her utmost speed, and off he went. Nothing could be more self-evident now to Tom than the fact that he was distancing Jonathan Wild, and he felt quite elated at the idea that in a very few moments he should be able to tell himself that he had escaped. But, alas for Tom ! for some reason or another Daisy came to an abrupt standstill, and refused to go a step forward. Spur and bit were of no avail, and in another moment poor Tom found himself surrounded by Jonathan Wild's men. 41 The gun !\" again shouted the man, who had seen the fugitives. \"Perhaps the pistol will do as well,\" cried Tcm, as he fired at the man, who he saw clearly and distinctly in the doorway of the inn, and then, without waiting to see if he had hit him or not, on he went, keeping a hold of the bridle of Daisy with one haud, while with the other he pressed that of Ellen. \" Seize him !\" roared Wild. A couple of the officers laid violent hands upon Tom, for they saw that he was feeling most probably for his pistols. With their practical skill in such matters, they speedily enough disarmed him, and bound his arms behind him with a cord. It was quite useless to struggle against these proceedings. Twelve men were something more than a match for Tom Bipon. At this moment it was that the clatter of horses' feet coming at a brisk pace along tho road fell upon the ears of Tom and Ellen, and Tom drew aside to let the party of horsemen go by them quietly, for he did not wish to come into collision with friend or foe just then."], [339, "333 EDirn heron. \"Now,\" said Jonathan Wild, who stood by, with his hand on Daisy's bridle \u2014 \" now, my dear fellow, how do you feel?\" \" I feel rather better than you did, Johnny, when the ghost of Captain Heron took me out of the death-cart on Holborn-Hill.\" The work that Tom alluded to was to get his hands out of the piece of cord that tied them to gether behind his back. It was no easy matter for him to squeeze one of his hands out of the bondage in which they were both held. It would be quite impossible to describe the change that came over the countenance of Jona than Wild as Tom uttered these words. The skin was much torn by the rough state of the cord, and Tom felt his hand was dripping with blood before he got it free ; but extricate it he did, and he kept his teeth so firmly shut, that not the least sigh or sound of pain escaped him in the process. What a relief it was to him, though, when he did, at last, get his hands fairly free ! Of course Tom took care that no notice should be taken of his partial state of freedom by any exhibition of his arms or hands, which, even in the intense darkness, might possibly have been seen by the officers who were following him, but the next thing he wanted to do was to release himself from the belt that was round him, and which bound him to the man Jenkins, who rode upon the same horee. Rage and terror appeared to be struggling for mastery in his mind, and both these expressions found a place in his hideous physiognomy. \" Wretch !\" he cried ; \" is it from you that I am to put up with such taunts ?\" \" Yes, to be sure, Johnny,\" said Tom. \" Theu die the death you have provoked!\" With these words, Wild drew a pistol from his pocket, and fired it, as he thought, full in Tom's face ; but he, Tom, instantly stooped so low, that the couple of bullets with which the pistol was loaded flew over it. \"Don't do that again,\" said Tom; \"it's dan gerous.\" \"What!\" roared Jonathan Wild, \"has he a charmed life? Will nothing kill him?\" One of Jonathan Wild's men now stepped for ward. Probably this man's heart was not quite dead to every kindly feeling ; and Tom's youth and courage, too, might have inspired him with something like compassion. \" No, no ! don't kill him, Mr. Wild \u2014 don't you take his life. The law will do that soon enough. It will not sound well to say that twelve of us, with yourself at our head, could not take this mere lad without first shooting him.\" \" Ah ! well, be it so. Hanging is worse than shooting. Bring him along !\" shouted Wild. \" Mount him on one of the horses, and bring him along at once ! And mind you look to him !\" Tom had a knife in a narrow pocket, made by himself to hold it, in the lappel of his coat. \"Now,\" thought Tom, \"if I can manage to get hold of my knife, I can, at any moment, cut the belt, and give Mr. Jenkins a little dig with the point of it at the same time, and then I can slip off the horse, and as there is a capital state of darkness in the road, I shall have a pretty fine chance of life and liberty, and of regaining Daisy and Ellen.\" Such was the calculation upon which Tom went ; and now, with the knife in his hand \u2014 for he managed to get hold of it, as the trotting of the horse effectually prevented Jenkins from no ticing any little movement \u2014 he waited for a good opportunity of putting his daring project into execution. \" Shall I strap him behind me, Mr. Wild ?\" asked the man who had interceded for Tom's life. \" Halt !\" said Wild. The officers stopped their horses. 41 Is tho prisoner all right ?\" he asked. \" Quite right, Mr. Wild ! He is fastened to me, you know, sir, by the belt, and he can't get away.\" \" He seems pretty quiet now,\" said Wild- \" Yes ; that will do, Jenkins. You will then know that he is quite safe. That is the best way you can get on with him.\" \" How kind you all are !\" said Tom, assuming a cheerfulness he was far from feeling in reality, for he was in alarm for the fate of Ellen and Daisy, for he knew not what bad become of them during the first part of the fray. \" Now, young fellow,\" said Jenkins, \" mount, if you please.\" \" Dear Jenkins,\" said Tom, \" are you afraid I shall fall off if I am left by myself ?\" \" Kather !\" said Jenkins, sulkily. The night continued to be intensely dark \u2014 so much so, that Tom could scarcely see the dusky forms of Jonathan WUd and a couple of the offi cers, who rode on in advance of those who might be said to form his special escort. The party, with their prisoner, now proceeded in silence, and the darkness seemed rather to in crease each moment than to dimiuish. 44 Yes, Jonathan Wild,\" said Tom, in a dejected tone ; \" it's a dead beat this time. Jenkins,\" said Tom, in a whisper. \" Well, what is it ?\" \"Do you pity me ?\" Jenkins was silent for a minute or two, aud then he said, \"Well, Tom, upon my word, I do ; for you are as good-looking and likely a young lad as I ever saw ; but, for my sake, don't speak to me, as jTou know what Wild is when he is thoroughly enraged.\" 44 That will do!\" said Tom. Now Tom had fully intended to have accom modated Mr. Jenkins with about three or four inches of the knife in the small of the back, but when the man said that he pitied him, Tom could not find it in his heart to do any such thing ; but if he had had a rough and brutal answer from Jenkins, why, he certainly would, with some de gree of satisfaction, have perpetrated the act ha had contemplated. \"No,\" thought Tom, \"I must try my luck without that ! I can't hurt him Bother the fellow ! why didn't he answer me like a brute ?' \" Well,\" said Tom to himself, \" I can't say, for certain, where we are ; however, wo are in a lane, or by-road, now, that's quite clear from the size of it ; and when we get a Uttle further, I may see some familiar object, for all I know to the contrary, that may tell me whereabouts we are. In the meantime, I have work before me.\""], [340, "334 EDITH HERON. Jonathan Wild now turned and spoke to his Still, without letting Wild know where he was, Tom made a strange, yelling scream, that came very horrible upon the night air to the ears of the officers, and then he walked his horse some distance, and only very gradually increased its pace as he got far enough off for the clatter of the horse's feet upon the road not to be heard. Then he put it to a trot ; and, finally, at a full gallop, Tom tore across the road, and retraced his steps, in hopes of encountering Ellen on Daisy. men. \" Be careful, now, and look to your prisoner. Vou had better come singly, for this infernal old bridge even shakes under me and my horse as I go over it.\" \" All's right, sir !\" replied Jenkins. \" Come on, then, and follow me !\" \"Now or never !\" said Tom to himself. \"If l can do any good, it will be on this same shaky little bridge.\" No one could be more fully alive to all the hazards of what he was about to undertake than Tom himself ; but he had made up his mind that Jonathan Wild should not take him a prisoner into London if lie could by any possibility avoid it ; and the risk of present and sudden death even was to him preferable to being again an inmate of the dreadful cells that Wild had beneath his house, and of which Tom had already had a taste that was quite enough to last his life. Exactly in the centre of the little bridge, Tom, with one sharp and sudden stroke of his knife, cut the belt that held him to Jenkins, and slid off the horse close to the parapet of the bridge. The first sensation Tom had was, that he had struck his head a sharp rap against a large stone that lay against the parapet, and then he heard Jenkins cry out, \" Help, help ! Catch him ! He's off !\" Successful pursuit, as long as Tom kept on horseback and the horse kept his feet, was out of the question upon the part of Jonathan Wild and his myrmidons, even supposing that they had any idea that he had galloped off upon one of their horses. Tom had now reached, as well as he could guess in the dark, the turn in tho lane close to the \" White Horse,\" where he had been separated from Ellen. Looking, then, cautiously to the right and left, Tom said, in a low voice, \" Ellen ! Ellen ! Daisy !\" Tom fancied he heard a slight movement in the hedge. 41 Who is there ?\" said a voice, in female ac cents. Tom looked about him, but could not, at the moment, guess where the voice came from ; but at last he fancied he saw a face looking over the hedge. Wild uttered a perfect yell of rage and incre dulity. \"I'd father drown than hang!\" cried Tom, and then he threw over the parapet the huge stone against which he had struck his head. Splash ! it went into the water, and then Wild cried out, \" He's over \u2014 -he's over ! Fire at him ! Kill him if you can, any of you ! This way \u2014 this way! Dismount, and follow me! Never mind the horses !\" iuge. 4L Who speaks ?\" asked Tom. 11 Oh, heaven be thanked, it is he !\" cried Ellen ; for it was indeed she, still seated on the back of Daisy, but the intense darkness prevented her from seeing who it was that had called her by name. In another moment Tom had the satisfaction of holding to his breast that young and innocent girl whom he had been the means of rescuing from her villanous associates at the \" White Horse.\" Leaving his horse to take its chance, Wild rushed to the brink of the stream with both his pistols in his hand. The officers followed him, and Tom was left aloue on the bridge. That virtuous young girl did not refuse an embrace and a kiss to him who had done so much for her, and who had more than once risked his life in her service. * CHAPTER CCXCIII. \" Tom, Tom !\" she sobbed, \" is it a miracle hy which you escaped from Jonathan Wild ? How was it possible tliat he did not capture you ? Aud to think that I was the cause of all this ! Oh, you do not know, Tom, what I have suffered while waiting here for you !\" 41 He did capture me, dear Ellen.\" \" He did ?\" TOM ELUDES JONATHAN WILD, AND BECOMES POSSESSED OF ANOTHER HOUSE. \" There he goes !\" cried one. Bang went one of Wild's pistols at a bundle of weeds that was floating under the bridge. 14 Have you hit him, sir V\" asked Jenkins. \" Yes ; to be sure I have.\" \" Yes ; but I managed to give him tbe slip again, I am happy to say. But all that is past now, and I feel much happier than I have been for a long time.\" \" I am glad of that,\" said Ellen. 41 Aud now, dear, we will make our way to wards London as fast as we can; but I think you can manage to ride Daisy, and in that case I will take possession of Jonathan Wild's horse.\" 41 Oh, yes!\" said Ellen; 4t I can ride him. But where am I to go ? Alas ! I have no home now !\" 14 Don't make too sure of that, Johnny,\" thought Tom, as he made a dart at the first horse he saw, and was in the saddle in a moment. Bang! bang! bang! wtnt three more pistol shots. And now there was nothing to hinder Tom from riding off at once, and leaving them all to their own mistakes and errors, but he thought he would say a word to Jonathan before ho \u2022vent. \"No home now ?\" said Tom. \" Why, surily, Ellen, you never called that horrid pHe? the 'White Horse,' a home ?\" 44 It was all I had.\" lia had, indeed, opened his mouth to do so, wnon another idea occurred to him, and he shut it again without uttering a 6ound. \" No,\" he said, \u2014 \" no ; it is better not !\""], [341, "335 EDITH HEROS. \" Well, don't regret losing it ' I wiU tako j ou with mo, EUen.\" \" But \" below, came into the servants' hall, where Tom and Ellen were talking. \" Here, Ogle, I wanted to see you. Just go and fetch Mrs. Ogle. I want her to take care of this young lady untU I can speak to Lady Edith about her.\" \" But what, dear ?\" \" It is not quite 1 mean, I wfll not be a burden to you, Tom. I will get a situation.\" \" We'U talk about that aftorwards, Ellen ; in the meantime, I am going to take you to my home.\" Ogle looked from one to the other in amaze ment ; but there was a look of innocence and helplessness about EUen that went at once to his kind heart. \" Is your homo in London ?\" \" Yes.\" \" All right, Tom ! Wait for me here, and I'll fetch Mrs. Ogle.\" Ellen had sunk down on a chair, and sobbed. \" Have you a father and mother ?\" asked the young girl. \" I have a mother.\" Tom was in vain trying to comfort her. \" Nay, why do you weep so, dear EUen ? I toll you you have nothing to fear now ; and do I not love you dearly, Ellen ?\" \" Oh, yes ! I know \u2014 I feel that you love me, Tom ; but yet I cannot but fear that this lady of whom you speak \u2014 the Lady Edith \u2014 will con demn my conduct, and yet, heaven knows, I havo done aU for the best 1\" \" Oh, I am so glad ! beeause I think I shaU love her.\" \" Hem !\" said Tom. \" I don't think, EUen, the old gal \u2014 that is, my mother \u2014 is exactly the sort of person you would care to know, and I have no father.\" There was a long silence, broken only by the patter of tho horses' feet. Tom was busy with his own reflections. He wondered if Captain Heron would approve of all he had done, and his conscience whispered \" Yes.\" \" No doubt of it, Ellen. And as for the Lady Edith, why, I tell you you do not know her. ohe-is the sweetest, gentlest creature in all tho world, and wiU only be too glad to hold out a helping hand to us ; and besides, Ellen, in a very lilile while I shall ask you to give me tbe right to protect you and watch over you. Shall you suy ' Yes,' Ellen ?\" As Tom uttered these words, ho took Elleu's hand in both of his, and looked into her eyes. No words came from her lips, but Tom felt from that moment that he was all in all to that young and virtuous being. Ellen, too, was lost in thought. She knew nothing of her companion but that he was brave, handsome, and evidently loved her. Ellen was tolerably well educated. Her father had been a respectablo tradesman, and bad taken care to give what ho considered better than a sluwer to bis only child \u2014 namely, a good educa tion. When be died, he bequeathed his greatest treasure, Ellen, to au only sister, leaving her in possession of whatever money or other valuables he had savecC in trust for his precious child. How the faithless sister .fulfilled her duty wo have already seen. At this moment Mrs- Ogle entered the room, and, going up to the young girl, she took her kindly by the hand, saying, \" You look pale as a ghust. Come with me, and I will give you some thing to put a little life into those poor chilled limbs. Deary me ! why her hands are like ice !\" \" Don't stand talking here, Mrs. Ogle,\" said Tom, \" but take EUen to your room, and do tho best you cau for ber, and in the morning I will speak to Lady Edith.\" \" Good night, dear EUen !\" whispered Tom, as lie pressed ber band ; but this time he did not kiss her \u2014 there were too many spectators, for Ogle, too, had returned \u2014 aud young, pure love is bashful ; and if Tom had before fancied himself iu love with every pretty face tbat bad met his eyes, he was quite convinced, now, that Ellen had inspired him with a very different feeling to any which he had experienced before. \" Well,\" said Tom, when he was once more left alone, \u2014 \" well, this has not been altogether a bad night's work ! I have got Jonathan Wild's horse, aud \u2014 yes, I feel sure of it thia time \u2014 a wife into tbe bargain ; for I mean to tell the Captain all about it in the morning, aud I'm sure he'll not say no when be knows that my love is returned by EUen.\" The clouds had cleared away, aud the sun was just rising, as Tom took from his pocket a key which opened the little wicket gate leading to the stables at the back of Whitcombe House. \" Where are we ?\" asked Ellen. \"This is where I live,\" said Tom, with a smile. \"Let mo assist you to dismount, and then, when I have got both the horses in, I will take you into tbe house.\" Mechanically, Ellen obeyed, for she felt faint iind weary with the night's excitements and ex ertions ; and having been kept so long without food, it was with difficulty that Tom could sup port her with one arm, while with the other he led in first Jonathan Wild's horse, and then Daisy, into the stables. , r \" That'll do for tho present,\" said Tom, closing the gate with a breath of relief, \u2014 \" that'll do for the present ! I'll come back in a minute, Daisy, and attend to you. Now, dear, cheer up ! You wUl be safe here, and in the morning I will speak to the Lady Edith about you.\" \" Lady Edith ?\" \" Yes, dear one. She is the wife of Captain \u2014 CaptainFantome, the gentleman who live., here \u2014 as noble and brave as you can imagine, It was with a smile that Edith greeted Tom Kipon the next morning, as the latter en tered the green drawing-room, with which tbe reader is already so well acquainted.

Tom looked somewhat confused. He tried to speak, but tbe words he would have uttered seemed somehow to refuse to pass his lips. \" Speak, Tom,\" said Edith. \" I already know Bomething of the occurrences of last night, and of your gallant conduct with regard to that young girl . but I wish to hear from your own lips something more than Mrs. Ogle can tell me.\" Tom took courage, as he glanced at the face of Edith ; and then he said, \" Oh, Lady Edith, I really do love Ellen ; and if I can only get your consent, and that of Captain Heron, I shall be the happiest man in the kingdom.\" \"But what does Ellen say herself, Tom?\" asked Edith. money now you, know. I feel as though I had somebody else to work for.\" As Tom left the apartment, Edith turned to Felix and said, \" I really think this time, Felix, that Tom is in earnest.\" \"So do I, Edith, and I am very glad of it. Nothing makes a man so estimable as a good and kind wife, and I think from the little I saw of EUen this morning, .sho is well calculated to make Tom a happy man.\" At this moment, there was a gentle tap at the drawing-room door, and in answer to Edith*s \" Come in,\" Ellen entered, looking very modest and pretty in her little smart cap and a snow white apron. \"Well, Lady Edith, I should say there would be no difficulty in that quarter ; for, look you, Lady Edith, she has no father \u2014 no mother \u2014 no friend but me !\" \" Oh, here is EUen, mamma !\" shouted the child, springing to his feet. \" She tells me such beautiful stories about birds and flowers. Me want to go to Ellen, mamma.\" \" And myself and Felix,\" said Edith. \"Oh, thank you \u2014 thank you !'\" cried Tom, in an excited voice. \" If you befriend us, then we shall do quite well, and I can go out every night on the road, or on the heath, and make a fortune ; and wheu we have got enough, why, then we will settle down, aud open a quiet little inn somewhere.\" \"Go, dearest,\" said Edith, as she impriuted a fervent kiss upon the lips of her much-loved child. CHAPTER CCXCIV. TOJI RIPON IS AGAIN PURSUED BY JONATHAN WILD. At this moment, Felix Heron entered the apart ment, and placing his hand kindly upon Tom's shoulder, he said, \"And so, Tom, at last you think you have really have found the person who is some day to be Mrs. Tom Kipon \u2014 eh ?\" \"Don't joke about it Captain, don't,\" cried Tom. '* I was a fool ever to have thought I cared for anybody, before I saw Ellen Shackle ; but now I know beyond a doub\u00a3 that I am quite in earnest.\" Towards nine o'clock, Tom Bipon was standing with his arm round Ellen's waist, trying to make her believe that he was going out merely for a ride. Ellen sighed. 41 Now, my dear Ellen,\" said Tom, \"you know that I love you as dearly as one human being can love another; and do you not think, therefore, that for your sake I shall take all the care of my self in the world. {Since I have known you, I value life so much more than I did before, so you may be quite sure I shall take the greatest care of myself.\" 11 Then you will come back soon, Tom ?\" \" Yes, as soon as possible, Ellen ; but I have to meet some friends, and they may detain me, you know, perhaps beyond the hour of your retiring to rest.\" \"Well, Tom,\" said Heron, \" I believe you are, and you may be quite assured I shall not stand iu the way of your hapniness, if at the end of three months you still continue in the same mind.\" . \"I see how it is, Captain,\" said Tom : \"you won't believe I'm in earnest until I've really been and gone to church, and got married out and out. Then, I suppose, you'll have no doubt on the subject?\" \" Not the least, Tom. Now, tell me if you feel inclined to go on the road again after what occurred last night?\" \" Most certainly, Captain, if you'll trust me with Daisy. I fancy I should not take half so much interest in my adventures if it were not for her.\" As Tom gave utterance to this speech, it must be confessed he had some qualms of conscience. He then kissed her as lovingly as possible before he left Whitcombe House. In another moment, Tom was mounted on Daisy, and leading Jonathan Wild's horse by the bridle, he intended as soon as ho saw a good opportunity to let the riderless horse go. He soon came to a long, narrow lane, where Tom started off, and had the satisfaction of seeing it go at a smart gallop right down the lane. 44 Take her, Tom, and welcome. Remember what we both owe to you.\" As Felix Heron spoke with some emotion, he drew to his bosom his little child, who, all un conscious of what Tom had done for him, threw his arms round his father's neck, and asked coax ingly for a game at romps. Tom now put Daisy to a gallop. \" Hilloa ! \u2014 hdloa, there !\" shouted a voice. \"Not now, not now, my boy,\" said Felix, as he sat the child upon the floor, at his mother's feet. \" I must read those papers this morning, dear Edith, that Tom and I were fortunate enough to despoil Warringdale of.\" \"Then I may take Daisy to night, Captain?\" asked Tom. Tom did not slacken his speed. He turned round in his saddle, and saw three or foui mounted men galloping after him. 44 Now for a race, Daisy, my lass !\" said Tom. \" Hilloa !\" shouted the voice again. \"Pull up, or we will fire at you !\" \"Fire away!\" said Tom ; and as he spoke ha urged Daisy on at increased speed, and with hia light weight the creature was able to get oa tre mendously, \"Yes, and I need not warn you to be very, very careful of her, Tom.\" \" All right, Captain. I want to make some"], [343, "337 EDITH HERON. Bang! went a pistol-shot, but it did no !'ips they toi cs Tow had been, for they aU \u25a0jtopped till this sOia had opuned the gate again , and hin fright made him bungle so that he de layed tham nearly a minnla. \" You idiot !\" roared Jonathan WUd. \" If it had cot been for yoa shutting the gate we should have had him ! What is the use of me losing my time watchir.g for that scoundrel here aU this evening, only to lose him through your con founded stupidity ?\" \" Very sorry, sir,\" said thc man ; \" but I thought I was doing the best thing to assist you, Mr. Wild, I am sure I did !\" \" Confound you !\" muttered Wild. \" There were papers in the saddle of that ho___> he stole from me last night that I would not have lost for all I possess !\" \" What did you say, Mr. Wild?\" asked one ot his men. harm \" Hold hard ! Halt, I say again !\" shouted the voice. \"Forward, forward, Daisy!\" was all Tom said ; and on he sped at a rattling speed. Eot now an obstruction presented itself in the sh\u00bbpo of a toll-bar. The toll-bar keeper evidently guessed that there was something wrong on the road, for he rushed out of uis little house, and shut the Satc- . . \u201e * I'll nit forget you for that,\" thought Tom. In another moment more Tom reached the gate, and over went Daisy. \" Murder ! Stop him ! stop him !\" cried the man. Off he went again ; but the gate was an ob stacle to his pursuers, who were not so weU mounted, and wero not so reckless as to what \"Nothing, idiot! Speak when fon'rs spctkcn No. 95 \u2014 Edith Heros."], [344, "EDITH HERON. 338 to, and don't listen when what is being said is not intended for your ears f The man slunk back. Tom had got considerably the start of his pur suers now, and really began to think there was a chance of his escaping. \" WeU,\" said Tom to himself, \" I think Jona than Wild might have waited till I had had some sport on the road before he hunted me down a^ain. Never mind, Daisy, lass; we'll have another try before we go home, won't we, lass ?\" pursued by eight men on eight horses ; and, as sure as they see me, as surely they wiU shoot me.\" \"Oh, this is dreadful!\" exclaimed the yonng girl. \" What have you done to be so hunted ?\" \" I don't know. I don't thiuk I deserve it,\" said Tom. \"No, I am- sure you don't,\" said the young girl- v \" Thank you for that kind speech ! I think you will save me if you can.\" \"Oh, yes, I wiU!\" \" Ah, I knew you would!\" \" I hope you are not very wicked. Ton don't look as if you were.\" \" Well, I don't think I am,\" said Tom ; \" but I might, perhaps, be better, aud I will some day.\" \"That's right!\" said the young girL with a sweet, bright smile. \" Come this way, and mind your horse does not trample down any more beans. I don't know what aunt will say when she sees this bed.\" Daisy moved her head up and down as she was wont to do when Tom was holding any of his mysterious conversations with her; and then Tom made up his mind to get out of tbe high road as soon as he possibly could, and seeing a lane to his right, he made a dash round the corner of it. Tom now began to walk Daisy ; but presently be beard the unmistakable clatter of horses' feet, and then he knew that his pursuers were again on Ms track. He happened at this moment to be just beneath the hedge of what seemed to be a very pretty garden. \" Oh, say a pig got in by accident.\" What further might have passed between Tom and the young girl was put to an abrupt termination, for the horsemen seemed to be re turning. There w..s no time to lose, so he contrived to drag Daisy by the bridle through a gap in the hedge into the garden beyond. This little garden adjoined a cottage he could just see through the boughs of the fruit trees, and over the tops of .the beans and peas, with which it was well stocked. The beautiful girl trembled very much as she ran along a little pathway, the sides of which were adorned with flowers of many hues, and then opening a-rough looking door at the end of it, she said, \" Go in there. It is where we keep our fruit.\" Tom made Daisy crouch down as she had been taught to do, and then thrdw himself flat down beside her, between two rows of peas, and then he heard his pursuers pass by. \"I understand,\" said Tom; \"good night! But first tell me how I can thauk you 7' \" Not at all. I am afraid \" \" Saved !\" he said, as be scrambled up again. As he did 90, Tom was quite taken aback at the \"Of what?\" \" That I am doing wrong.\" \"No ; a kind action can never be wrong, dear. Tell me what your name is ; but if you don't I shall never forget you ; and I can't think why people are made with such pretty faces as yours, except it is to ruin the wits of the rest of the world. Oh \" moment, for coming down one of the garden paths was a beautiful young girl about -sixteen years of age. \"Don't be alarmed, miss,\" said Tom. \"I would not harm you for the world.\" \" Oh, who are you?\" said the girl, suppressing her inclination to scream for assistance. The young girl shut the does abruptly in Tom's face, to put an end to his compliments, so that be was left to himself in complete darkness. 'What a smeU of apples there is here!\" said Tom, as he stretched out bis hand and secured a'very fine oue, which he began eating. \" A hunted man !\" said Tom. \" Don't you hear tbe bloodhounds ?\" It must have been the cheerful and kind tone in which Tom Bipon spoke that reassured the alarmed girl, but she looked puzzled, and Tom thought be had never seen such eyes before, that had in them such a world of tenderness. Tom had not got past the age when he could relish an apple with all the gusto of youth. \"Capital!\" said Tom. \"I feel myself very much refreshed ; and, if it were not that the image of EUen is at my heart, I should take it into my head that this young girl was tho prettiest and gentlest creature iu the world ; but, at all events, she is the next best. Heigho ! what a thing it is a man can only have one wife !\" \" Oh, teU me who and what you are ?\" she said. \"I am ' Tom stopped short, for, to teU the truth, he did not know what to call himself to that young girl. The word highwayman was upon his Ups, but he did not Uke to say tbat to her. \" Why do you not teU me who you are ?\" she said, stiU regarding him earnestly. \" Because I hardly know myself,\" replied Tom ; \" and that's the real truth,\" in his pleasant and ingenuous way, that always had a sort of Tom thought then it would be just as well to examine as .well as he could in the dark the mode of exit which tho young girl told him ho would find at the back of tho apple-house, and lie found that it was a small door on the late.h, which opened close to the margin of a little pond, evidently a duck-pond. \" That'll do,\" said Tom. charm about it. \" But how can that be ?\" persisted the girl. u You must know who you are!\" \" Never mind now who I am. Is it not suf ficient for you to know that I am in great danger \u2014 perhaps in danger of my life. I am AU Tom's reflections wore no%v put an end to, for it appeared that Jonathan Wild and his men"], [345, "339 EDITH ITBROIl had become so impressed with the belief that be must be hidiug somewhere in the lane, that they dismounted, aud leaving their horses in char~*. of one of tbeir number, they began hunting about the bn\u00abbus i>.t a great rate. Mr. Wild? This here gpl says he's only a mere lad !\" ,; Dees she ? That is capital !\" shouted Wild, who had been busily engaged searching the garden. \" Now, my dear, all you have to do is just to say quietly where he is !\" Poe* Mary was ready to sink to the ground with r.morse and terror at what she had said, for she saw in a moment, after the words had passed her lips, what she had done, and that nothing now could save him. During their search they soon camo upon tho garden, and the idoa struck them at once, from the rath .r dilapidated otato of the hedge, tbat he and Daisy might havo made their way through it. \"Hero's a gap!\" cried ono. \" It's too small,\" cried another. \" Oh, I don't know ! Besides, the hedge can be easily pushed together on the inside, and he is cunning enough for that, I take it.\" \" No doubt of his cunning.\" \"Very well, then. You all of you keep a watch on the hedge,\" said Jonathan Wild, \" while I and Jukes go into the gardcu by the house gate.\" \" Very good, Mr. WUd.\" \" Oh, no, no !\" she cried, as she clasped hor hand*' imploringly. \" I know nothing \u2014 indeed, I kne ;v nothing ! I did not say I knew anything, did 1 ?\" \" You d!d, though,\" said Wild. \" Do not say that ! Oh, aunt, what did I say ?\" \" C( me, come !\" said Wild, as he drew a pistol from his pocket. \" Come on ! We shall get him at last ! This way ! Shoot him, so as to dis able him, if he should resist at all !\" \" All's right, Mr. WUd!\" Poor Mary uttered a shriek of despair, and sunk upon hor knees on the grass plot. She hai really wished to save Tom. There was some thing in his looks which seemed so pitiable, and withal so frank and good-tempered, that -she could not believe that he had done anything so very bad ; but now she found by her own want of tact she had probably destroyed him. And yet what could she do now ? Nothing but pray for him, and that she did most fer venily. Then Jonathan Wild and his bull-dog made their way to the front entrance to the cottage, and demanded admittance in tho King's name. Tho young girl's aunt was dreadfully alarmed ; but she let the officers into tho cottage, and thence, at their request, into the garden. \"Oh, gentlemen,\" she said, \"who do you want? I am a lone widow, and Uve here by myself, with my niece Mary !\" \" Who do wo want ?\" asked Jonathan Wild. \" Why, a highwayman, to be sure, whom you havo concealed in this house I\" \" Oraei.i.s-< providence !\" exclaimed the elderly woman, raising her hands. \"Me hide a high wayman ? Oh, oh, oh ! There's no highway man here, gentlemen, , that I'll take my solemn Bible oath of! I'm net a highwayman, neither is Mary ! \" Tom knew nothing of aU this, as he was in a distant part of the garden ; but if he bad, hs would have felt no indiguation at the innocent girl, whose very innocence aud anxiety to save him had caused her to utter words that were so much against him. \"I don't say you arc, ma'am,\" said Wild, with a brutal lough ; \" but wo mean to look for ourselves, for all tbat! Your garden has not a very good hedge, and we suspect the person we are after has concealed himself and his horse in \u00bb\" Poor, poor Mary, and poor Tom, also \u2014 for, with all his faults, we must pity him. Jonathan Wild and his men soon came to the apple-house, in which Mary had shut Tom. Tom heard them. \u25a0 \" A man and a horse in my garden ?\" almost shrieked the woman. \"Merciful providence, what will become of the fruit and vegeta bles ?\" \" Now for it !\" he said. \" I suppose my fate hangs upon the next five minutes !\" \" Here's a door !\" said Wild. \" I'U fire through it, if I can't open it ! ' Oh; it's aU right \u2014 it's only on the latch !\" . Mary and hfir aunt had followed the officers out into the gardon, and were standing upon the little grass plot in front of the cottage. Poor Mary waa tho picture of fright. Her face had turufid quite white, and she trembled very much. \" You needn't be afraid, my dear,\" said Wild's bull-dog, as ilie gleam of the lantern he carried fell upon her palo features. \" We don't mean to harm you.\" \" No, no\u2014 I'm not. afraid !\" gasped Mary. \" That's right ; but yon look as if you had seen a ghost ! You'd better go indoors !\" \" Why !\" \" Because, you see, if we do find the young fellow we're after, thorell be a bit of a disturb ance, for he's sure to show fight!\" \"Oh, how cruel!\" \" What is cruel ?\" \"Of yon \u2014 two big men as you are\u2014 to bo pursuing such _ mere i\u00bbd \u2014 almost a boy !\" \" Ah, you ham seen him ! Did you hear that, It must be confessed tbat Jonathan Wild, not withstanding his brutal kind of courage, wars well aware of the danger that might be in store for him, for he felt certain that if Tom happened to be on the other side of that door, a couple of bullets woidd be the salute he should jneet with. That idea was none of the most agreeable, aud we can scarcely wonder at Jonathan Wild hesi tating. It was with a feeling of relief that he called out when he had opened the door, \" All's right !\" \" Not there, Mr. Wild ?\" asked his man. * No,\" shouted Wild, \" he is not there.\" \"What door is that at the back, sir ?\" \"I don't know,\" said Wild; \" let's open it\" \" Confound your curiosity,\" thought Tom, ind he tried to get cautiously round the corner of the storehouse, leading Daisy by the bridle ; but his foot, shpped and he half feU. \u2022'Hilloa!\" cried WUd; \" I hear a noise !\""], [346, "EDITH HERON. 340 \" Take that, then ?\" said Tom, as he fired a pis tol st Wild's head. \" Now, then, we'U make sure of you this time, young fellow,\" he said, with a brutal laugh. A flush of colour mounted to Tom's cheek at this proceeding ; he would have given some thing not to have been subjected to such an in dignity in the presence of that fair young girl. \" Hold, Jonathan Wild!\" he said ; \" you know I keep my word if I make a promise. I wiU l.ot try to escape if you leave my hands at liberty.\" \"Not if I know it,\" replied Wild, who ap peared to enjoy Tom's discomfiture greatly. \" Not if I know it. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, you know, any day. So, here goes !\" His hat and wig flew off, but he was bimseU uninjured. CHAPTER CCXCV. TOM EIPON SUCCEEDS IN FRIGHTENING JONA- THAN WILD, AND IS ALLOWED TO GO IN PEACE. From the moment that Tom found his presence in the garden was discovered, he felt that there was no possible chance of escape, and the shot be bad fired was rather from impulse than from re flection. Tom felt that resistance would only make matters worse, so he quietly surrendered his hands, aud Jonathan WUd roughly placed the handcuffs ou them. \" Has he hit you, Mr. Wild ?\" asked his man. \" As nice a fit as if they had been made for you,\" be said, looking triumphantly at Tom. Tom made no reply to Jonathan Wild ; but, turning to tbe young girl, he said, as cheerfully as he could, \" Good-bye, dear Mary!\" \" Oh, can you ever forgive me ?\" she asked, as she placed her warm, soft hand upon bis mana cled wrists. \" I don't know, confound him,\" was the reply. \" Tom Eipon !\" Wild then shouted, \" you are my prisoner ! We are two to one here, and there are four more in the laue : so give in, or it will be worse for you.\" At that moment Mary appeared, and clasping her* hands she cried, \" 01_, be is taken ! They will kill him \u2014 they will kill him ! He is taken !\" \" Forgive you ? wdiy I have nothing to for give ; but I have a great deal to thank you for. You are a good, brave girl, and I should be a great deal more .contented if I thought the day would ever come when I might be able to do you a good turn.\" Jonathan Wild chuckled malignantly, as he said, \" I wouldn't make any promises if I were you, as you'U only have time to make yeur will ; and if you have anything to leave to this girl, why, that would be the greatest service you will ever have an opportunity of rendering her.\" \" Oh ! cruel \u2014 cruel !\" said Mary. \" Cruel or not cruel, I can tell you this is the last time you'U see him, unless you like to attend his execution. In that case, I wiU, for a consi deration, undertake to procure you a good view.\" \"Nevermind,\" said l'om, kindly ; \" it is all right.\" \" But you are hurt ! I heard fire-arms ! They have shot you !\" \" No, thank the Fates, I'm not hurt ! A s for me, don't think ever again that you saw me. For get me. Our acquaintance began this hour, aud this hour let it end \" \" I am very\u2014 very sorry for you.\" \" That I know,\" said Tom ; \" and it is some consolation to know that there is one kind, gen tle heart that is sorry for me.\" \"I did all I could to save you,\" said Mary. \"Hush!\u2014 oh, hush!\" \" Oh, you did, did you ?\" said Wild, savagely ; \" in tbat case, I believe it is my duty to take you prisoner, likewise ; for it is a high crime to aid a criminal.\" Poor Mary clasped her hands over her eyes and wept bitterly. \" I'm ready, , you villain !\" shouted Tom, roused now past all forbearane.. \" Lead on. Good-bye, Mary ; you'll see me again before long.\" In another minute the party left the garden, and Jonathan Wild had Tom placed behind one of his men for the greater safety. \" Are you a man,\" said Tom, \" and utter such words to an innocent young girl, who is still almost a child ?\" Wild pretended not to hear what Tom said, and his man took an opportunity to whisper to her. 41 Forward !\" shouted Wild. \"Don't crj'i my dear; no harm will come to you- Dont mind what Mr. Wild says to you; he's always blustering out stupid things.\" Now it must not be supposed for one moment that Tom, notwithstanding all his anxiety for his own personal safety, had forgotten his dear companion, Daisy. He had never taken his eyes off that n\u00abble creature during the whole of the proceedings which we have been detailing ; and it was with a feehng almost of agony that he behold Jona than Wild seize her by the bridle, and seem to appropriate her to his own use. \"I am not thinking of myself,\" said Mary; and then she looked at Tom with such a mute eloquence, that there was no need, upon her part, to tell any one that it was of him she was thinking. \" Don't think of me, either,\" said Tom ; \"all are not lost who are in danger, you know.\" The young girl shook her head, and sighed deeply. At this moment, Jonathan Wild, who had been hailing thc men whom he had left in the lane, returned, and producing a pair of handcuffs from a capacious pocket in hia coat, he advanced to Tom. Still Tom had a scheme in his head, and he waited for an opportunity to carry it out. Wild, in his anxiety to keep Tom continually in his sight, lest, by some means or another, he might again make his escape, gave Tom every facility for keeping close to Daisy also. They were just about to mountv when Joua-"], [347, "341 EDITH HURON. than Wild turned and glared at Tom, as he said fiercely, \" Tom Ripon, you have not many days w live, and you may just as weU be on good terms with me as not, for I have the power of malting the remainder of your lUe very miser able if you continue to defy me.\" \"Oh. indeed!\" said Tom, with a careless air. \" And jray what do you want me to do in order that my life in Newgate may be so jolly as you seem to intimate it may be ?\" \" Return me those papers you found in .the pocket of my horse's saddle, and aU personal enmity will be at an end.\" \" No, no, Johnny !\" said Tom ; \" I must have something more than you promise for those papers, because I am in hopes I shall be able to get you hanged by giving them up t.o the proper authorities.\" Tom began to think his case looked rather hopeless, but he had removed a great load off his mind by setting Daisy free, for he had no doubt in his own mind that she would skid her way back to the stables of Whitcombe House. The little party now moved on in silence ; but ever and anon, Jonathan WUd could be heard muttering to himself, \" Fool ! fool that I was to trust those papers to the safe keeping ef a horse. Why did I carry them about with me ? I would give any price for them \u2014 any price in reason, if I but had them in my own possession again.\" \" Would you, Johnny ?\" asked Tom. \" Th?n why don't you strike a bargain with me at once, for their redemption ?\" \" What would you ask for them ?\" \" My freedom, Johnny ; nothing less would suit me, I'm sorry to say.\" \" SUence, wretch !\" WUd uttered a yell of rage, and his men could scarcely suppress a laugh at what they consi dered the courage of Tom in thus speaking to their redoubtable leader. \" Oh, very weiL just as you Uke. I thought I was obliging you,\" said Tom. \" Look there ! Who's that?\" \" Wretch, I wiU search you myself, but 1 wUl recover them !\" roared WUd. '\u2022 Who's what?\" asked Wild. \" Wny, there, between the trees,\" said Tom. \" I could almost declare it was Captain Heron himself, mounted upon Daisy ! That's jolly ! Hurrah! hurrah!\" 11 That won't be quite so easy, Mr. WUd,\" re plied Tom; \"for I have given them into the hands of a friend of mine, who, if I am hanged, will at once dehver them into the hands of the Lord Chief Justice.\" WUd clutched by the mane of the horse upon which he was riding, and would have fallen but for that support. The sudden movement, how ever, startled the creature, and it reared vio lently. Tom began to have some hopes of work ing upon the fears of Jonathan WUd, now that he found he attached so much importance to those ; .ipers, which, it wUl be remembered, he (Tom) lis.d found in the pocket of the saddle of the horse he had seized when he left Jonathan WUd aud his men looking for him on the Uttle bridge. Jonathan WUd now made Tom mount behind one of the men, which Uttle operation he was so intent upon watching, that he somewhat slack ened his hold upon Daisy. \" Confusion take you !'' growled WUd. \" What do you mean ? I see no figure.\" \"Why, there, to be sure!\" cried Tom, glad to perceive the advantage he had obtained over WUd, and hoping to profit by it. \" Why, there to be sure ! I have no fears now, Johnny : he has come to rescue me, no doubt.\" \" Tom \u2014 Tom Ripon, hear me !\" said Wild, in chokiDg accents. \"Ho, Daisy! Oh! oh! Fly, Daisj !\" cried Tom. \" WeU, go ahead ; I'm aU attention.\" \"HI let you go this time, wiU you promise me that you will destroy those papers ?\" \" You'll be obliged to let me go, whether you Uke it or not. See, he comes !\" The inteUigent creature, with one bound, tore herself loose from the sUght hold WUd had on her bridle, and flew, rather than aught else, down the road as swUtly as an arrow from the bow. \u2022\u25a0 Confound you !\" shouted WUd, as he dealt Tom a blow with his hanger. It wiU be remembered that Tom was almost helpless, for his hands were fastened behind his back; bnt as good fortune would have it, he happened to be behind the same man who had before been constituted his keeper, under similar circumstances, and who, it wiU be remembered, had told Tom that he pitied him. This man now parried the blow, which must otherwise have fell upon Tom's defenceless head, saying as he did so, \" Hold hard, Mr. Wild ; if you knock the boy's brains out now, you wUl de prive us all, and yourself at the same time, of the pleasure we are looking forward to of seeing him hanged at Tyburn.\" Tom understood what the man was doiug, and lie immediately made a mental vow to himself that if ever he could be of any service to the r siigh man he would not forget that act of kind ness. Jonathan WUd was ghastly pale, and glanced about him on every side. \" Do you see anything or anybody, Davis ?\" he asked of the man behind whom Tom was riding, highly amused at the turn affairs had taken. \"Can't say as I do, Mr. WUd,\" repUed the man. \" Why, of course not,\" said Tom ; \" ghosts only make themselves visible to those whom they wish to be seen by. I've no doubt but that yon wUl see nim as plainly in a few minutes as you did on Holbom HiU that day, you know, when he took me out of the death-cart.\" Jonathan WUd breathed heavily. \"Look you, Tom ; I never intended,\" he said, \" to hang you this term.\" \" Indeed !\" interrupted Tom. \" Why, I thought you said I had only a few hours in which to make my wiU.\" \"Mere jest \u2014 mere jest; nothing more.\" said WUd. \u2022'Ride on!\" said WUd, \"and yon, Davis, lend me your horse, and I will ride behind to see that this scoundrel does aot escape us a ere ood time.\" \" And these handcuffs ?\" asked Tom. \" Ar\u00ab they mere jest also ?\" u 4 matter of form *"], [348, "EDITH HERON. 342 \" Oh, indeed ! Then perhaps, Johnny, you will, just for form's sake, produce the little key that belongs to them, and set me at Uberty.\" _ I will\u2014 I will.\" \" That is something like ! Now, Johnny, I feel as if I could almost forgive you for spoiling my night's sport by detaining me all this time. Come, make hasto ! I see Captain Heron has been standing stiU all the time we have been (diking, as if to give you a chance of doing tho tight sort of thing without any interference on his part.\" \" But he is too far off to hear what we are saying,\" said Jonathan, his teeth chattering as he spoke. \" Oh, distance is nothing; ghosts hear miles off. Why, the day you were geing to hang me \" Heron, knowing that he would bo safe from all pursuit from Jonathan Wild if he took that course. \" Well,\" said Tom to himself as soon as he had placed some distance between him and Jona than Wild \u2014 \" well, at all events I ought never to speak against ghosts ; they have stood me in good stead this night.\" CHAPTER CCXCVI. TOM RIPON HAS AN ADVENTURE, AN\u00bb ACQUIRE- SOME BOOTY. \"Elles \u2014 my dear Ellen!\" were the first words that Tom uttered as he stood beside that gentle girl on the morningsucceeding the events detailed in our last chapter. It is not too much to say tbat Ellen was too completely overcome by the emotions of that happy moment, when she found herself clasped in the arms of Tom Ripon, to speak. The silence, however, was far more eloquent than language could have possibly b.en, and she could only sob out heV thankfulness tc heaven that had permitted her again so much happiness ; for it will be remembered that it was with the greatest reluctance she bad parted from Tom on the previous night. \" EUen, I cannot yet hear you say one word,\" 6aid Tom, \" to assure me that you are glad to see me returned safe aud well.\" Wild made an imploring gesture with his hand, but Tom pretended not to see it, and con tinued. \"The day you were going to hang me he was at the furthest end of Hampstead Heath just as the cart was leaving Newgate.

Tbe order was instantly obeyed, and Tom quickly dismounted. \"Forward!\" shouted Wild. Upon this, Ellen did manage to make an effort to say something, but somehow the words seemed to choke her ; but she did contrive at last to say, \" Tom\u2014 Tom\u2014 my Tom!\" This was quite sufficient for Tom Ripon.

When Tom managed to speak again, his voice was broken and unsteady; but it was with the truthfulness of pure joy that it was broken \u2014 tho tears came from the heart's overflowing. \" My own darling \u2014 my pretty EUen \u2014 do not crv.

Is it to be a bargain?\" \u2022' Agreed !\" said Wild. \" Davis, dismount, and let him have your horse.\" In another moment Tom was in the laddie. Ho then handed the papers to Wild. \" There are the plvpers, although I feel almost as bad as you are id thus giving them up ; but a promise i_ a promise, and so good-nighl !\" Tom dashed along in the direction of a clump of trees, where he had pretended he saw Captain"], [349, "343 EDITH HEE0X.

I do think that when any one ioves sincerely, and without offence to heaven's virtue, as I love you, Ellen, that that one is spe ciady under the protection of angels ; and so, in a manner of speaking, is encased in the proof armour of that affection which shaU save him from peril in this world, and, perhaps, be his pass port to the world to come.\" It was a gentle and happy thought that of Tom's After a few moments Ellen strove to smUe, as she rephed, \"Tom, then I, too, have that armour.\" The look of terror that was upon the faco of the old man was such that Tom found it difficult to withdraw his gaze from him. The horse was going at a good pace, anc. must have been a very docile creature to keep his route as weU as he did, notwithstanding the very odd and wayward manner in which he was driven by the old man, who seemed to pay no attention whatever to where the creature was going, so very intent waa he upon the bundle that he had on his knees. \" You, dear V u Yes, Tom ; for do I not love you ?\" \" Oh, Ellen, Ellen ! this is too much joy ! I do not deserve it !\" The bundle was wrapped up in an old shawl. Tom saw all this, of course, in much less time than it has taken us to describe it. \" Nay, Tom, it is not often that I have allowed those words, ' I love you,' to pass my lips ; but they have ever been at my heart. From the first moment that you entered that house of those wicked people who kept the ' White Horse,' I loved you. From that time my love has in creased, aud I know that it will never diminish ; and now I think that I love you as well as it is possible for any one to love.\" Tom was too much delighted by these words of EUen to recollect anything but that ho held her in his arms, and that she avowed that feeling for him which he had for her in such intensity. Tom walked Daisy right out into the middle of the i oad, and called out, \" Stop I* The old man, with a cry of despair, clutched the bundle that was roUed up iu the old shawl closer to his heart, and, dropping the reins, took from the seat upon which he had been sitting a double-barrelled pistol, and, poiutiDg it at Tom, he cried, in tremulous accents, \" Off, off ! or I must take a life ! Oh, do not stay mo ! I see that you are a young man, and it will be better for you to live, and say that you let me go free, than that I should have your blood upon my head.\" For a time, surely, their young hearts were very, very happy indeed. \" But now, EUen,\" said Topi, \u2014 \" now that you see, dear girl, that I come back to you safely, you will not object to my going out again to night, will you ?\"' EUen shook her head, as she said, \" What do you do, Tom, on these expeditions, taken at such a late hour ?\" \" Hold !\" cried Tom. \" No, no ! Off \u2014 off, I say \u2014 off ! Are you alone ?\" \" Yes, but don't shoot me on that account,\" said Tom. \" What have you there ?\" \" Nothing \u2014 nothing but a few trifles that I aui to convey to _ place of safety.\" \" Oh, intoed.'\" said Tom. \" Perhaps you wiU allow me to see these same trifles?\" \" Do not ask me, Ellen, there's a good girl. I am engaged in an undertaking by which I hope to hasten the time when I shaU be able to call you reaUy my wife.\" \" Stand back, I say ! stand back! I am dan gerous !\" \" And so am I !\" said Tom, as he coolly pro duced a pistol from the holster of Daisy's sadlle, and presented it fuU in the face of tho old mau. \" Now see,\" he said; \" perhaps you wdl allow me to see what you have so carefuUy tied up in that bundle ?\" The old man seemed terror-stricken, and Tom began to think that the double-barrelled pistol which he had produced was not really loaded. Slowly the old man began to untie one end of tbe shawl, and as he did so, Tom was sur prised and delighted to find that it contained gold and jewels to a considerable amount \" Why, what on earth, you old sinner, are you going to do with all this wealth, and how did it come into your possession ?\" \" Oh, kind sir,\" whined the old man, \" do not ask me\u2014 do not ask me; it is not mine \u2014 it be longs to a lady.\" EUen did not reply ; but it was with an aching heart that she saw Tom depart on the following evening, mounted, as before, upon Daisy, who, it is needless to inform our reader, who is already acquainted with tliat noble creature's sagacity, had found her way back to the stables at Whit combe House, when Tom so successfully bid ber. Tom now took a different route, in hopes of having an adventure without encountering any of Jonathan WUd's myrmidons. He bad proceeded some paces down a narrow lane, when he heard a vehicle rapidly approach ing- \"Shall I stop that chaise \u2014 for chaise I be lieve it to be by the sound \u2014 or not ?\" said Tom to himself. Before Tom could satisfactorily answer this question, which he bad put to himself, lie be came very much interested in the appearance of tho person in the chaise, and in the very odd manner in which he contrived to manage the horse that was in it. \"A lady?\" \" Yes, kind sir ; she owes me a deal of money, and as she could not pay me, I have consented, as a favour, *a take these little nick-nacks as a kind of secui-.v.\" \" Oh ! and wl-.o may the lady be, pray ?\" asked Tom. From the light from the lamps on either side of the chaise, Tom could see that its occupant was a very old man, with white hair. He had on a faded suit of livery, and on bis arm he car ried a bundle, about whicli he seemed to be dreadfully anxious, for he held it close to hslj \"Well, sir, I \u2014 U\\t is, I never was good at names. Dear me ! what is Ber name ?\" The old man rubbed his furrowed brow, and put on an air of deep reflection. \"No nonsense!\" said Tom, clicking his pistol"], [350, "EDITH HERON. 344 so as to frighten the old man out of his senses almost, \u2014 \" no nonsense ! It cannot be possible that you should forget the name of any one who owes you so much money as to entrust all those jewels to your keeping, as security for the pay ment of it.

'\u25a0\"WeU, then, if you must know, it's the Countess of Whitcombe,\" \" Oh, you old scoundrel !\" said Tom, as he grasped the old man by the neck, and shook him backwards and forwards. to the coachman, '-'Stop, coachman, or yon wi!l get an ounce of lead in your brains !\" \" Oh, lor', who's that ?\" said the coachman, _,_ he pulled up at once in a fright. A man's head was suddenly projected from end of the windows of the carriage, and a voico caUed out to the coachman, \" Go on\u2014 go on, coachman ! On your life, go onl\" \" I can't sir,\" said the man. \" Here is a high wayman, with a pistol as long as my arm.\" \" Go on, I say !\" stiU roared the occupant oi the carriage. \" No, he won't !\" said Tom, as he let down tho window of the coach. \u2014 \" he will not go on !\" \" Who are you ?\" asked the voice which had just issued such peremptory orders to the coach man. \"Murder! murder! Spare my life, kind sir, and I wiU tell you aU about it.\" \"I want to hear no more. Hand the bundle over to me instantly, just as it is.\" \"A highwayman !\" said Tom. (: Come, come, sir \u2014 no nonsense ; you must have guessed who 1 was long before this.\" Tom stooped down and looked into tbe car riage, and was surprised to see that it contained also a lady. While Tom was taking this cursory glance ia at the carriage window, he saw the gentleman draw a pistol stealthily from a pocket in the breast of his coat. \" Never !\" roared the old man. \"Never? We'll soon see about that,\" said Tom. Here goes! When I count five I shaU fire this pistol, and off wUl go your head.\" \"Mercy \" One !\" \" Help !\" \" Two !\u2014 three !\" \" Take that !\" he said, as he levelled it at Tom, and fired at the moment. \" Mercy \u2014 mercy ! Spare an old man's life ?\" \" Four !\" Before Tom could count five, tho old man shrunk down to the bottom of the chaise, ap parently unconscious. \" Well,\" said Tom, \" that makes it all the easier. I wUl reUeve you of this bundle, old chap, and when you come to yourself you will find you have been eased of an inconvenient load. Forward, Daisy \u2014 forward, lass !\" With a bound, Daisy sprung forward, and Tom, quite satisfied with his little adventure, began to ask himself what he should do next. Tom, young as he was, had had too many pistol shots discharged at his head to be much alarmed at this one, and with a cool dexterity that few men could have effected, he moved aside just in time to avoid it. The horses in the coach were a little alarmed at the noise of the discharge, and began to plunge, so Tom called out to the coachman in a threaten ing tone, \" Get down, coachman, and hold your horses' heads, or it will be the worse for you.\" \" Oh, lor', yes, sir !\" cried the coachman ; \"any thing you Uke sir, so that you won't put that ounce of lead your worship's honour spoke of in my brains, sir \u2014 that's all, sir !\" The coachman roUed off his box, and held tbe horses by the head ; and then Tom, looking into the vehicle, said, \" If you would like another shot at me, pray have it at once, my good sir, and satisfy your mind. My turn is sure to come, but I am in no sort of hurry about it, I beg leave to assure you.\" The lady uttered a 6cream. \"Now, sir,\" said Tom \" be quick, if you please You know what I want,\" Just as Tom had put this very pertinent ques tion to himself, he became aware of the sound of carriage wheels. \" Oh !\" said Tom to himself, \" the night's sport is not yet over.\" It did not take many minutes to let Tom see that the usual canter of Daisy would suffice to bring him up with the coach ; so he felt at that moment a conviction that he could, at any time, get up to the side of, and astonish, the occupants, whoever they might be. In this way, then, on he went, keeping the vehicle just in view, and waiting until the most unfrequented part of the road should afford him the best possible opportunity of putting his plans into execution. \" You are a highwayman, you say, and want to rob us. Do so, and go your way. Give him what you can, my lady. I have no money my self, but you can give him all you have. I didn't mean to shoot you.\" Tom opened the door of the carriage, and ho said fiercely, \"Come out \u2014 come out, I say!\" \" No, no ! I teU you I didn't mean to shoot you ; it was all a mistake.\" Tom hesitated a moment, but springing from Daisy's back, he made a dash at the 10gs of the gentleman, and fairly dragged him out on to the roadway. Desperation now lent the gentleman courage. which he was far from possessing in its better and more ennobling condition, and he, with a yell of rage and despair, clung to Tem, and tr.oi ______ utmost to throw him to the grout.;}. The carriage now seemed to go at a rapid rate \u2014 perhaps tho horses thought they wero going homewards, and did their work more energetic ally. Tom had slightly to increase his speed. A gloomy part of the road was just nigh at hand. Tall trees on each side nearly met overhead, forming a natural leafy arch, and a trickling, rivulet ran by the roadside. There was no hquse near, and interminable fields seemed to stretch away to the right and left as far as the eye eould reach.

The night, as we have stated, was a dark one, and it was indeed just such a night as suited highwaymen. If it had been positively bad weather, which it was very far from being, Tom would have felt that such a state of things was against him, inasmuch as it would have kept people at home. it, Tom was right, for the man was au invete rate, unprincipled gambler and sharper. \"Now, sir, be quick !\" said Tom, still keeping the muzzle of the pistol close to his eyes. \"Yes,\" gasped the man. \"You \u2014 you know me?\" \" I do. I know you are a rascal, and so I have no sort of hesitation of at once ridding society of your presence.\" \" Mercy !\" \"Ha, ha! Mercy? Why that is a good joke ! Why, my dear sir, you can havo no idea of who you are speaking to when you ask mercy of me.\" But such was not the case, and the night w&n not one to deter any one from going out in it, whether on business or on pleasure. So Tom now put Daisy to speed, and trotted as far as Baling Common before he thought it at all wiso to look about him for anything in the shape of an adventure. \" Who are you, then ?\" \" That doesn't signify,\" replied Tom. \" Hand over your plunder.\" The man saw that be was at a disadvantage, so he handed to Tom a pocket-book and a watch. \"Now,\" ho said, \"I have the road pretty well to myself, I reckon, and we wiU see what wo can do, eh, Daisy _\" Hardly had Tom uttered these words when he became aware of a strango light flashing across his path, and on glancing about him lie found that it came from a lantern that some ono was holding up at a gate in a. garden wall, a good distance from where he then was. \" Is this all ?\" said Tom. The man was silent ; and then he said, after reflecting for a tan- moments, \" Yes, all \u2014 all.\" \" I don't beUeve you. I shall go and search the carriage, and if I find anything secreted there I will return and blow your brains out.\" \"Stop! \u2014 oh, stop!\" \" Well, what now ?\" Tom did not by any means wish to bo seen, so ho took a round_ course to get out of __0 way of tho direct rays of the lantern, and then he slowly walked Daisy in the direction of the house to which the garden wall belonged. By the aid of a clump of trees that grew close at band, Tom was able to get so close to the door of the garden wall that he could see a man in the sort of undress of a gardener standing at it. \" There is some monoy in one of the pockets of the carriage. I had forgotten that until this minute\" \"Oh, indeed! WeU, then, come along with me and find it.\" As Tom said this, he laid hold of the man by tho collar of his coat, and dragged him towards the carriage. A very few minutes sufficed to put Tom in possession ' of the wholo of the gains of tho gambler. \" That'll do,\" said Tom, as ho counted a roll of bank notes into his pucket with one hand, while ho still held the pistol in the other. * That'll do ; and now good night.\" Tom had no difficulty iu recovering Daisy. A word from him brought the intelligent crea ture to his side with a bound. In a few minutes a female figure, with a shawl thrown over her hoad to protect her from the night air, came to the door. Tom could hear their voices in thc silence of that spot quite plainly, for at that time Ealing Common was very considerably more in the country than it is at the present day. \" Do you see the chaise, John ?\" asked tho female. \" No, ma'am.\" \" Woa, Daisy !\" In another moment Tom and Daisy were fly- \" But it is past ten.\" \" Yes, ma'am, it is.\" \" Then they really ought to be hero.

With this view, then, he kept across the eom inou, every road and path of which he knew so well, towards London ; and just as he got iu tbe sether narrow part of the road that leads towards Acton, he heard the grating sound of wheels ap proaching him from London. \"Perhaps this is the chaise,\" said Tom to to himself, \" with the boy Ned drivins the young lady.\" . un placed himself close to - the hedge, in a very dark part of the road.

Now, Tom knew tho bearing of tho roads thereabouts tolerably well, but so dark was the night that he could not bo said to know very well each particular lane, so that the real fact was that, about three o'clock in tho morniag, he found himself what might wilh truth be called benighted. the night air. Witli a deep sigh, Ted jerked tbe bridle of tho pony, and had made two or three steps forward, when a man darted from tho shadow of the trees, and cried out in high tones, \" Halt !\" Tom drew rein, and tried to look about him, but the most positive darkness reigned about the spot, and the only sound that met his ears was the sighing of tho wind among thc branches of the tall trees. Ted puUed up. \" Another step, and you die !\" said the horse- man. \"Oh, murder! It's a highwayman, with a pistol as long as a rake !\" cried T\u00abd. A feeling of great loneliness crept over Tom, and he began to wish most devoutly ho had taken some other route. \"Silence!\" \" Yes, sir \u2014 yo?, your worship !\" \" Oh, then,\" cried Miss Johnson, \" we are close at home. Drive on, Ted, or you risk your life and mine !\" Ho walked Daisy so close to tho hedge on one side that the creature stepped into a little ditch, but tho depth was so very trifling that Tom thought it best to let her stay there- The sound of footsteps came each moment more and more clearly upon his ears. \" If he attempts to move an inch,\" said tho horseman, \" I wUl shoot him dead on the spot. Now, young lady, I want whatever valuables you may happen to have about you !\" \" Help! help! help!\" shouted the young girl. \" Hilloa !\" cried Tom, darting from his hiding place. What cry was that ?\" In the course, then, of a few minutes he heard voices. One of those voices was that of a female, and the other that of a man. It so happened that the persons who wore talking had some Uttle difference of opinion about something which they paused to discuss close to where Tom had drawn up, in order to hear what sort of peoplo they might bo who, at such an hour, were abroad in the green lanes. \" It's no use, I tell you, mother,\" said the man's voice. \" I can't manage it that way.\" \" But it's the only way,\" said the female voice, \" I tell you, it's the only way !\" \" But there's such a lot of 'cm, I tell you !\" \"What of tliat?\" \" Protect me!\" cried tho young girl. \" Protect me, sir, if you be a gentleman ! I am going to Mrs. Grimstead's, and this man will not let me proceed. Oh, protect me, sir!\" \" I wUl soon do that,\" said Tom. \" Who are you, sir, I should like to know?\" \" Find out,\" said the horseman. \" Very well, we can soon do that. I suspect you are a highwayman !\" said Tom. The man at first seemed inclined to hold his ground, but perceiving that Tom had drawn a couple of holster pistols from Daisy's saddle, and had levelled them both at him, he seemed to think aU of a sudden that discretion was the bet ter part of valour, and giving his horse, which was undoubtedly a good one, an impulse with tho spurs, he dashed off across the common. Bang! went one of Tom's pistols. \"What of that, mother? Why, everything of that! There's enough of 'em, I tell you, to swallow me, if they all set about it.\" \"Stuff! Nonsense! Coward!\" \" Oh, it's all very well to say ' Stuff, nonsense, and coward,' but it's a fact, for all that \u2014 and I don't seem as if now I half liked Ihe job.\" \" You fool !\" \"Come, now, don't begin to abuso me, for that's of no sort of use. I like the girl's money well enough, and I like her well enough \u2014 but I don't liko the danger. Come, now, think of some other sort of way of managing it, do.\" \" I can't,\" replied the female voice. \" Then I don't think it will be managed at all, for I don't seem os if I wero at all equal to it.\" CHAPTER CCXCVIII. TOM RIPON OVERHEARS AND FRUSTRATES A PLOT. \" I don't think you will be annoyed any moro now, my dear,\" said Tom, to the young lady in the chaise. \"And as for you,\" he said, turning to the boy who was driving, \" if you don't drive on as quickly as possible with this young lady, I t^hall discharge my other pistol at you, and teach you how to behave in future to young ladies who honour you so much as to allow yon to drive them.\" \" Ah, Sam, you don't understand mo, I see.\" \"What on earth,\" thought Tom, \"can all this be about, I wonder ? I will listen a little longer. Sam raised rather a little laugh when thc old woman said he did not understand her, and he replied, \" Oh, yes, I think I do, mother. You want mo to run off with Miss Woods, from the school over yonder, under the pretonco that her father is dying. I understand you well enough, and I'm afraid they will find mo out\" \" Good gracious ! was ever anybody half so trying as you aro ? How could they find you out?\" \"Yes, sir! I'm off at once, sir \u2014 but she is very beautiful \" \"SUenco!\" shouted Tom. \"Another such word, and I keep my word !\" Ned evidently thought it advisablo to proceed as quickly as Lightfoot would allow of his doing, and in a few minutes Miss Johnson's adventures for that night were brought to a conclusion. Tom now turned Daisy's head towards thc Edgeware Road, and from there took a field- \"How?\" \" Yes, how can they find you o _t ?\""], [355, "349 EDITH HERON. \u25a0 Oh, a thousand ways. Girls are so know- when they wore at a sufficient distance to enable him to speak without what ho said being overheard by them. \" You are \u00bb nice couple ; but I'll try to put a stoppor upon this lillle trans action.\" ing!\" \"But, Sam, now just let me tell you how safe you are. Haven't I bought you a beautiful suit of groom's Uvery, which you have on now, by the by?\" A pitchy darkness now reigned around, ind Tom was at a loss to think how he should find the house which had been spoken of by the old woman and her hopeful son. Just as Tom, however, was beginning to think that he must give up the idea of finding the house, the sky began to get of a hazy, 6treaky outUne in one quarter of it, and presently there peeped out just one corner of a bright moon, and then, on his right hand, Ton* saw the chimney pots of what apDeared to bsl rather a large mansion among a thick grove of trees in the meadows, and* although it was certainly about twenty yards off, yet he could not doubt but it was the school. \" Yes \u2014 yes !\" \" And how nice you look in them!\" \"Stuff!\" \" Not at aU. I don't say it because you are my boy, but you know you are good-looking.\" \" Oh, well, I never doubted that fact, mother ; and another little one into the bargain \u2014 and that is, that you are a woman of taste.\" \" And haven't I bought you that hat, with the sUver lace round it and the cockade at the side of it \u2014 and don't you look as nice as nice can be ?\" \"Well?\" \" Then don't talk to me about being found out, don't ! Miss Woods is only fifteen years of age, and she is an orphan, and she has got ten thou sand pounds, all of her own ; and if you can once get off with her out of the school, and get to town with her, and to a very nice house in the City Road \u2014 where, thank goodness, there's no lodgers, just now \u2014 I'll take good care that she shall marry you !'' \"WeU, mother, you are clever, I grant you; but what, suppose \" \" I will rouse them,\" said Tom. With this view Tom walked Daisy slowly along, and presently came to a little gate, which, upon dismounting, be found ha could easily lift off its hiuges. \" That'U do,\" said Tom. In another moment he had lifted the gate, and thrown it down in the meadow, and then he, with ease, walked Daisy past the obstruction. To mount again, and to trot towards the house, was the work of another moment. \" Suppose what?\" \" Why, suppose everything goes right, and you get her to our house, and then she turns out as obstinate as a pig, and won't be persuaded to marry me ?\" \u00ab Indeed !\" AU was darkness in the mansion ; and it was in vain that Tom sought for some window at which the presence of even a faint Ught might lead hmi to suppose that some one was up. \" Well, she may, you know, mother.\" \" Well, then, my dear Sam, I'll put something into her tea \u2014 that is all!\" There was no time to lose ; and Tom tied Daisy to a branch of a tree close at hand, and then he dashed up a flight of steps to a door on which there was a handsome balcony. After a Uttle searching, Tom found a beU handle, and gave it a couple of as vigorous pulls as he possibly could ; and, in fact, he heard, each time that he did so, a bell ring very loudly and violently somewhere or another isside tho house. Something into her tea?\" \" Yes, my dear Sam !\" \"Why, you don't mean to say, mother, that you would go to poison her, do you ?\" \" Oh, dear, no ; but something that'll make her 60 sleepy and so stupid that there'll be no sort of difficulty after that.\" \" Oh !\" \"That'll rouse them!\" said Tom. \" Yes, you may say oh ! but I know how to manage all that.\" \" Well you are clever, mother, and no mis take, so I think I will consent.\" \" That's right, Sam ; aud mind you have all right what you are going to say.\" \" Oh, yes \u2014 yes !\" \" But if you make any blunders they will find you out, and then all our trouble and expense will go for nothing at all.\" \" Oh, trust me ! I am to say that I have come from Captain Jordan for Miss Woods, as he is at the point of death, aud cannot die happy unless he sees her.\" \" Now you know the way to the gate bell, aud all you have got to do is to say what yon have just repeated to me.\" \" Oh ! I shan't forget.\" \" Then go at once, and I shaU not be far off, and the coach will wait for us near; so be off at For a time aU was stUl ; and then a n-indow just above the balcony opened, aud a female voice demanded, \"What do you want?\" \" Open tho door, my dear madam, \" repUed Tom, \"aud you shall know all.\" \" Go away, young man, go away ; or I wUl set the house dog upon^you.\" \" You will not open the door ?\" asked Tom. \" Certainly not.\" \" Then all is lost.\" \" Yes, your trouble is lost, that is all, young man. So you can go back as wise as you came.\" \" Well, madam,\" said Tom, \" if you will not allow me to protect you against possible violence, I will put you upon your guard against possible fraud. You have a young lady in this house of the name of Woods?\" \" WeU, what of that ?\" \" Then you will soon have an application,\" s_id Tom, \"at the front door of your house, from a pretended servant iu livery, who wiil come and say that her father is at the point of death, and that he desire, to see hrr at once. If you yield to that appUcation, and '.et her go, you at occo one?.\" The wonan and her hop eful s;n went alorg thc lane, leaving Tom a little amused by what ho had overheard. \" You're a couple of beauties !\" siid Tom,"], [356, "350 EDITH HERON. place her in the hands of fiends in human shape, and you will never see her more.\" \" Ie this possible, young man ?\" \u2022' It is true.\" \" Courage, ma'am.\" Tom had fairly now got into the house, when a very loud knock as well as a ring came at the door of the mansion ; and from somewhere on the floor above, there arose quite a commotion. \" Madam,\" said Tom, \"you will have the good ness, I am sure, tc permit me to reply to the person who is now at your door, so very im portunately demanding admission to this house ?\" \" Oh, yes \u2014 yes.\" \" Very good, then. There wiU be no danger, then, aUow me to assure you.\" The confusion above was now rather on tho increase than otherwise ; and .13 Tom glanced up the staircase, he could see quite a collection of heads and eyes looking down upon him. He could hear, too, occasional expressions from the young girls concerning himself which very much amused him. \" But\u2014 but \" \" Nay, madam,\" said Tom, \" you can take the warning or not, just as you please ; I have dono my duty.\" \" Stay a moment. Let me look at you.\" \" Very well,\" said Tom, \" I am quite willing.\" The schoolmistress came out on to the balcony; and as weU as the very faint light of tho moon enabled her, she took a look at Tom, who step ped out on to the lawn, in order to enable her to do sc. '\u2022 Wsll, you don't look Uke a young man that ought not to be trusted, I must confess. Who are you ?\" \" A gentleman,\" said Tom. \" If you feel that you can protect yourself and your house, after what I have told you, I will no longer trouble you. madam, for I've my own affairs to look to ; 'out if you cannot, I will adopt any course you think proper.\" \" Oh, sir, you terrify me !\" \" WeU, weU ! Have you the means of de fence 7' \" Oh, isn't he a love ?\" said one. \" Yes, he is,\" said another. \" Only look at him, Lucy .' He must be some officer.\" These and such like expressions of admiration of Tom from the school girls came so thick r.nd fast down the stairs, that at last the mist-ess called out, \" Young ladies, I am surprised at you. Repair to your dormitory instantly, and close the door !\" \" No, no ; indeed I have 'not !\" \" Is there no man in this house ?\" asked \" Yes, -ma'am.\" \" Go, then.\" Tom. \" But, U you please, ma'am, we are aU in such a fright about the thieves.\" \" Thieves ! There are no thieves ; go di rectly.\" \" Man in this house? Certainly not.\" '\u25a0 Then what do you propose to do ?\" Before any reply could be made to this ques tion, there came a ring at the gate bell in front of the house, and the consternation of the school mistress at this sudden confirmation of Tom's story -was very great. \"No,\" said Tom, looking up, \" there is no danger to any of you now ; for 1 am horc to pro tect you aU.\" \" There ! you hear that,\" said the mfs__c__. '\" Now you can all go to bed again.\" The girls still lingered. \" Oh, dea* ! oh, dear,\" said the mistress. \" They don't mind me in tbe least to-night.\" \"I'll soon make them aU go, ma'am,\" said Tom. \" Young ladies, since you are too much alarmed to go to bed, I'm coming to help you aU to do so. Here I am !\" \" Oh, if I could truly beUeve you, I would open the door, and get you to come in and afford us all the assistance and protection yon could.\" \" Well, tny good lady,\" said Tom, \" I have no means of convincing you of my good faith. If you won't believe me, I can't help it, although I shall be sorry to leave you in such an unprotected state.\" \" I will trust you \u2014 you shall come in ; I will not, I cannot doubt you any longer. Heaven for give you, if you are deceiving me ! I will open the door directly.\" Anotlier ring at the bell in front of the house gave another shock to the nerves of the school mistress, and she hastened to let in her ally from the back of the hoi;;e. Tom, as he spoke, made a dart at the staircase, and got up some half-dozen steps, when aU tho girls, with loud screams, disappeared in a ni'.r ment. Another ring at the bell, and another knock at the door, now announced that the pretended groom was not disposed to give up the plan of carding off Miss Woods, just because there was some delay in opening the door. \" Oh ! there it is again,\" said the school mistress. \" I am afraid we shall aU yet be mur dered.\" The schoolmistress was evidently in a state of great agitation ; and she was very anxious to catch a glimpse of Tom's face, in order that she might come to some judgment about the propriety of the course she was pursuing. By the light of the wax candle she had with her, she soon got that glance, and then she said at onco, \" Oh, I feel that I may indeed trust you. You cannot deceive me.\" \" Oh, dear, no, you won't,\" 6aid Tom. \" But what will you do, sir ?\" '\u2022 Have you any window above that cotnmandf a view of the front door?\" \" Oh, yes ! yes !\" \" Then it is from that that I would rather let \" Indeed, I will not,\" said Tom. \" Come in\u2014 come in at once ; but you aro very young to defend us.\" Tom drew himself up, as ho sail, \" I am young, but J am well arned; and I have, tbat without whicli all the mature strength in the world is Y... 1- 1W.S.\" the rascal see you aro not so unprotected as he seems to suppose.\" \u2022' But oh! bow can I take you to tho window above, when that is the very room in which the your.g ladies sleep?\" \" Well, ma'am ; I don't want to eat the y..r.:r_? \" What is that ?\" adies.\""], [357, "351 EDITH HERON. i \"But it would be dreadful \u2014 so unusual \" terrors and the sympathy with which it inspire. 1 her, she sprang from her bed, and was by the side of Tom Ripon in a moment, crying out, \" Yes, yes \u2014 I am here ' Oh, my dear papa! I will come at once \u2014 I will come at once!\" \" Nonsense, ma'am \u2014 nonsense !\" said Tom, losing patience. \" I will foUow you, and you can explain to the young ladies that I am neither an ogre nor a mad bull ; but that it is absolutely necessary that I should intrude into their room for a few moments.\" \" Thank you, miss !\" said the pretended groom. \" I've got a coach waiting, if you please, miss!\" '\u2022 Hush !\" said Tom \u2014 and ho llung his arm round the young girl, and half carried her back into the room. \" Go to bed again, I beg of you, my dear girl ! It is aU falso !\" \" False ?\" The schoolmistress led the way up the stair case, followed closely by Tom, who, as the reader knows, was the very 6pirit of fun and frolic, and who enjoyed the whole transaction amazingly. \" Will you wait here one moment, sir, if you please ?\" said the schoolmistress, when they reached the dormitory door. \" Certainly.\" The schoolmistress opened tho door, and Tom heard her say, \" Ladies, it cannot be helped. There is some one at the door who has evil designs upon us ; and the young gentleman who has come to protect you cannot see who it is, or tell him to be off, except from one of these win dows.\" \" Yes, I assure you it is !* \" But my poor papa \" Allow me to assure you that it is all a fabri cation. Your father has sent no such message ; it is nc thing but a trick to get you away from the school.\" \" Oh, are you sure of that ?\" \" Quite \u2014 quite sure !\" said Tom. \" I am so frightened !\" said Miss Woods, cling ing to Tom. \" Come, come !\" said Tom, gently. \" Don't tremble so ! Let me help you back to bed.\" Tom now led Miss Woods to the side of tho bed, for the poor girl was too much agitated to think of who was attending her; and then ha fairly lifted her into it, saying, as he did so, \"Come, come; make yourseU quite easy. Bo assured your father never sent for you 1\" \" Oh, yes, yes ! Thank you !\" Tom now returned to the balcony, and called out, \" Hilloa !\" \" Yes, sir,\" said the groom. \" You can go back, and take all our compli ments to the Captain, and teU him Miss Wood* declines to obey his orders.\" \" DecUnes to obey his orders ?\" A general scream followed this speech. \"So, young ladies, don't be shocked; for it cannot be helped, I assure you.\" \"Let's put our heads under the clothes,\" said one.\" '\u2022.Yes, and blow out the light,\" said another. \" Silence !\" said the schoolmistress. \" Here I am, young ladies,\" said Tom, stepping into the room. \" I hope you are quite weU.\" There was no direct reply to this for a moment or two, but there were very many suppressed giggles. Then a voice said, \" Pretty well, sir, thank you ! How are you?\" There was now a general laugh, and Tom thought it was high time to go to the window to question tho intruder. \" Yes.\" \" Oh, but, sir \" \" It's of no earthly use your talking there,\" said Tom. \" If you were to stay for a month, she would not come.\" CHAPTER CCXCI5. \" Sir, sir !\" said somebody, pulling Tom by the sleeve, \u2014 \" sir, if you please !\" Tom looked round, and saw, standing on the balcony by his side, au unusuaUy stout female, with a couple of pails of water. \" Bless me ! and who may you be ?\" asked Tom. \"Please, sir, I'm tho cook; and hearing as there was murderers and thieves, I got up ; and, if you please, sh-, and many thanks to you, sir, for coming to protect poor, defenceless females, I'll just throw these here pails o' water on 'em !\" \" Hush !\" said Tom. \"You shall! AU right! I'll just speak to the rascal again, and hear what he has to say !\" \" Do, sir, if you please, sir !\" \" Now, are you off, -fellow ?\" shouted Tom. \" Dear me, no, sir ! But yoa don't mean, sir, as to say that the young lady is so hard-hearted that she won't come to see her poor father, who is going to breathe his last, sir?\" \" She is, though,\" said Tom. \"Then, sir, it will be a terrible reprod'h to her, in time to come, sir ! I'm only a servant, sir ; but it seems to me as you ought to make her come ' She will bo back here again before the morning, if you like, sir ; and if so Le as you'll call up the school-mistress, I'm certain sure she won't refuse to let her come.\" TOM RIPON PUNISHES AN INTRUDER. THERE can be no doubt but that such a circum stance happening at the school was really, even with aU its alarm and all its terrors, one of the pleasantest diversions of the monotony of such a course of existence that could possibly be ima gined. Every eye wa3 fixed on Tom, and his really haDusome appearance fascinated more than one of the young ladies in the dormitory. He opened the window \u2014 which was a French casement one \u2014 and stepped out upon a balcony outside it, and cried out, in a loud voice, \" Who's there?\" \" Me, sir !\" said the mock groom. \"What do you want, feUow?\" Tom demanded, fiercely. \" Please, sir, I come from Miss Woods' father, sir, the Captain. He is at the point of death; and he says, sir, that he can't leave this world, sir, without giving his daughter his last blessing, you see, sir!\" Now this was spoken quite loud enough for aU tho young ladies to hear it, and conse quently Miss Woods heard it among the rest. Such a message was sure to seize upon her ima gination; and forgetful of everything but the"], [358, "352 EDira HERON. \"Yes, she wiU; so you hava your answer at once. I am here at aU times to defend this house ; so if you thought it was defenceless, you have made a very great mistake.\" \" Oh, lor', sir, you don't suspect me of any thing wrong \u2014 do you, sir ?\" \" Not at all,\" said Tom. \" Then let the young lady speak for herself ; and if she don't want to come, why, of course, I'U go away.\" dormitory of the young girls again, who wore not a Uttle alarmed at the pistol shot. \" I think you are all quite safe now,\" said Tom ; \" and, therefore, as my presence here may be an intrusion, I will leave you, if you please.\" The girls did not speak. \" Young ladies, good night,\" added Tom ; \" oi rather I ought to say good morning, for I per ceive the daylight is very close at hand.\" Tom made towards the door, and then, making a very low bow, he left the room, closely fol lowed by the schoolmistress, who was not a Uttle pleased at the general good conduct of the hand some young gentleman, as well as at the service that had been rendered to her establishment by him. \" No, I shaU not,\" said Tom. \" No-?\" \" I won't!\" said Tom. \" You'd better mind what you're about ! It's no business of yours ; and if you don't let her come, I'll \" \u2022 \"Hold!\" cried Tom. \"Do you threaten me?\" \" I don't know how to thank you, my dear sir,\" sho said, \"for you have indeed done me a great service.\" \"I do!\" \" And what then ?\" \" Don't mention it,\" said Tom. \" I'm only too glad to tbiuk I have been the means of saving oue of the young ladies of your establishment from disgrace and ruin. And now farewell, madam ; perhaps we may meet again.\" Tom now mounted Daisy, and, putting her to a smart trot, soon reached the neighbourhood of Whitcombe House, where he found EUen anxiously watching for him. \"Why, then, I ain't going to b. put off in this way; and I tell you, Mr. Jackanapes, whoever 3rou maybe, that I will come into tho house, and I will see Miss Woods herself !\" \" You shall not,\" said Tom, cooUy. \" Oh, we'U soon see that ! There is one of the windows on the ground-floor that I can get in at, for I see that it is a little way open.\" \"Now look !\" said Tom. Dash! went one of the pails of water right over the groom, and with such a fu.fr aim did it come, and there was such a deluge of it, thti U took away his breath for a moment, and he stood stock still. CHAPTER CCC. JONATHAN WILD AND WARRHsODALE MAKE A COMPACT. Dash ! went the other. \" There !\" said the cook, aa she flung the empty pail out at him ; \" I hope as you fuel a little damp now, you horrid wretch IM \"Murder! \u2014 oh, oh! \u2014 murder!\" Tho pail had fallen right oy?r the f?!low's bead, and he roared aud plunged about with it on him, without reaUy knowing what he was fight ing with. At length ho foU down, and the jiaU rolled off his head, and he sat on the \u00a3__d>_\u201e _n .'<, opposite to the door of tho house, half dead with fright, and drenched to the skin. \" Well,\" said Tom, \u2014 \" well, my friend, horj do you feel now; or do you want anoUvr bath?\" We must now return to Jonathan Wild. It is evening, and from the appearance of wine-bottles, glasses, and pipes scattered on the table, it would seem that Jonathan expected visi tors. He is seated in an old-fashioned easy chair, porevt\"! ir;'*lt chintz, which looks rather tho iroriKt for . 'aar ; his f&et are placed upon another tshfail, und ii.ogether tho great thief-taker looks tolerably comfortable. \" Ha ! ha ! ha !\" comes in low, guttural sounds from his lips. Evidently Jonathan Wild's reflections are, in his own estimation at least, rather clever than otherwise. \" Oh, no, no !\" \" Very good. If you don't be off not/ out of these premises as quickly as possiole, I will put an end at once to tho state of misery you are now in, by shooting you. I can see you nicely, and am now taking aim at you with a pistol I \u00aban depend upon.\" \" Oh, mercy ! Oh, don't ! I'm going ! Oh, murder !\"- \"Ha! ha! ha! He thiuks ho has succeeded in blinding me to thc fact of Felix Heron's existence. The young scoundrel ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! Tom Eipon, a mere boy, to suppose that bis wit <ras a match of Jonathan WUd ! Ha ! ha ! ha!\" Jonathan Wild's laugh, however, was anything but mirthful, and to judge from the manner in whioh he set down a glass which he had just drained of its contents, one would have thought he was anything but in an amiable mood. \" He is late,\" he muttered to himself. \" I want company ; this room is gloomy. I wish he would come.\" The cowardly rascal rolled over several times ; then, scrambling to his feet, he made a rush to get away, and Tom, by way of completely frightening him, fired oue of his pistols in the air. The moment he heard the report of the pistol, the rascal uttered such a yell, that if Tom had not felt quite sure that he had fired some twenty foot over his head, he must have thought him a dead man. At this moment a bell rung. \" Ah ! That's Warringdale.\" \" The very same,\"said that personage, entering the room. \" Ah !

Bah, man ! There are no such things,\" said Wild. \u25a0 Well, then, if there are no such things, as you say, why, then, Felix Heron is still in life, and is laughing at you and me, to think he is cajoling us both, while in reality he is going about at large enjoying himself.\" \" I doubt whether he is enjoying himself.\" said Wild, \"because he is in constant dread of yet bottles which contained brandy, and pouring out nearly half a tumblerful, he drained it. \"That's done me good, Wild ; and now I want to speak to you about Felix Heron.\" \"Oh!\" '\u2022 Why, what do you mean by that ? You don't seem to care to hear wbat I have to communi cate,\" said Warringdale. \" We thought he was dead, you know.\" \" No, we didn't \u2014 at least, I didn't\" \" Well, then, why on earth, man, have you been allowing him to live in comfort and security all this time, when, by giving him up to jus tice, we might have obtained such a reward as his capture would have afforded us?\" asked Warringdale. \" I had my own reasons for letting things take heir own course,\" replied Jonathan Wild.

Lord Warringdale immediately . directed his steps towards a low public-house in an obscure street, where he felt pretty certain of meeting with John Tarleton, with whom, indeed, he had an appointment a strong party of his bull-dogs, take him pri soner, and carry him off to Newgate.\" \" And how am I to assist you, pray ?\" \" Why, we thought that we would \\ keep wata_. outside while you contrived to enter jthe house by the back offices, and lie in concealment until all wa6 quiet, and then it-wouldrbeeasy to set fire to a few hands uis of -havings saturated with od, which I have no \u25a0 ioabt yoH wiU find plenty of in the stables, and leave them to' burn, say, in some little cupboard.

This way, if you please, sir.\" \" The gentleman you were expecting, Mr. Smithson,\" said the landlord, as be threw open the door of a dingy -locking apartment. John Tarleton had his. back towards the- door, but, on being addressed by the landlord, he faced about and encountered the gaze of Warringdale, full of meaning. \"Thank you, friend,\" said- John Tarleton. \" Ah ! I am glad to see you, \"he added, turning to Warringdale. ltHere, landlord,- bring us a bottle of your best old port, and see if you can find anything in the larder for supper while we arc discussing the wine.\" The landlord withdrew, weU- pleased with his guests. \"Nor L- either ; but I should like to see Felix Heron die on the scaffold, so I'liope he wiU get safe out of. the -house.\" \" Well, so long as we get rid of him, it does not much signify whether he parish iu the flames or on the scaffold. It wiUbs _U on* to us.\" \" True, true.\" At this moment the landlord entered the room, bearing a bottle covered with dust and cobwebs, which s umeientl y testified to the; good condition of its contents. \" That's right, landlord. We wiU amuse our selves with this whUe. you prepare us a nice little supper; but mind, we must leave in less than aa hour's time from now.\" \"-Gentlemen, evidently,\" he said, to himself; * though they don't look of much account, to be sure.

All was silent as the grave. In which room should he seek his intended outhouse, used as a sort of storehouse by Tom Bipon for stowing away superfluous articles which were for use in the stable and harness rooms, such as oil, bits of rag, pieces of stick, and any kind of rubbish that was not exactly to be classed in the category of useless articles. John Tarleton drew a match from a box he carried in his pooket, and having ignited it, gazed around him, in order to see what kind of abode was to be his probably for the next few hours. Suddenly he crouches down close to the wall, for he hears a footstep, and fear takes possession of his craven heart. victim ? Where was Edith ? Where was that fond mother who, to save her Uttle one, would willingly have coined her heart's blood ? \" Ha, ha ! Countess of Whitcombe !\" mut tered John Tarleton to himself. \" If I drive not a hard bargain with you this night, it shall not be my fault.\" He entered the room, but it was tenantless. And truly he had reason to tremble in every Umb, for now he hears a voice the tones of which he recognises but too well. \" Yes, Tom, as you seem to make such a point of doing so, I have no objection to your accom panying me.\" The tones were those of Heron. CHAPTER CCCI. EDITH AND HER CHILD ARE SAVED BY JONA- THAN WILD. What if they should have occasion to enter his temporary abode ? The voices are further off, and John Tarleton hears them unlock the stable-door, and Daisy and another horse are led into the stable-yard. There is a pause in the whispered conversa tion, and John Tarleton devoutly wishes he had not undertaken the affair. The apartment in which John Tarleton found himseU was a kind of study. Between the win dows was an old-fashioned bureau. A desire to look into that bureau took posses sion of him, hoping to find therein, if not money, at least something that might be valuable. He approached, and was glad to find that he could easily open it ; but he was disappointed to find that it contained nothing but a few old books, a few manuscripts, pieces of twine, and such like useless articles. \"Are you ready, Captain?\" he hears Tom ask. \" Yes, Tom,\" replies the voice of Felix Heron ; \" but there is a weight upon my heart to-night, and I seem as though I should Unger here, in stead of doing what I feel to be a duty.\" \" Oh, come on, Captain,\" said Tom. \" You've often felt like that before, and nothing has come of it. It's because you've had no exercise for so long.\" \" May be that it is so, Tom. I am ready.\" John Tarleton had tbe unspeakable satisfaction of bearing the horses led out of the stable, and the gate closed behind them. He breathed more freely. \" That's just as I would have had it,\" he mur mured to himself. \" I shall, at least, have no one stronger than myself to oppose me. I wfll make my way into the house now, and seek an interview with my sister. Sister, indeed ! A pretty sister she has ever shown herself to be ! Yes, yes, Edith Tarleton, I wiU seek you, and wring from your fears a sufficiency to make me amends for. whatever risks I may run this night.\" He walked towards the servants' entrance, and found the outer door yielded to his touch. \" So, so !\" he said to himself. \" Fortune fa vours me to-night ! \" \" Bah !\" he said, with a look of disgust ; \" there is nothing there. But stay ! Let me see what is in this drawer ; it seems as though it were full of something.\" He drew out a long drawer. at the bottom of the bureau, and found that the contents were carefuUy covered over with some sheets of brown paper. He raised one corner, and to his surprise found that it was a complete highwayman 's suit. There was the scarlet coat, the lace ruffles, large boots, three-cornered hat, with a long white feather, the embroidered waistcoat and rich cravat, all complete. \" Ha ! ha !\" laughed John Tarleton ; \" I will dress myself in these, and perhaps, as my lady has a taste for highwaymen, I may be more wel come in this costume than iu any other.\" In an incredibly short space of time John Tarleton equipped himself as a knight of the road ; and as he glanced at himself in a mirror that hung in the apartment, a smile of satisfac tion was visible upon his features. \" I fancy I look rather the thing,\" he said to himself. \" Surely my lady sister wiU consent this night to whatever I may propose. Ten thousand pounds, either in gold or jewels, I care not which, is all that I propose asking her for, and if she gives it me, then, perhaps, I may show her some means of escaping from this burning house, for it will most assuredly be a mass of ruins in less than six hours from this time.\" He entered, and found himseU in a stone pas sage that ran the whole length of the basement, and then he came to the stone steps which led to the upper regions of the mansion. A little oil lamp lighted this passage, and John Tarleton, therefore, had no difficulty in finding his way to the haU, and thence up the grand staircase of Whitcombe House. On the first landing he paused, undecided which room to enter. At la6t he determined to try the door of the nearest that presented itself. There was a swaggering gait about John Tarleton as he walked from that apartment in order to seek Edith, where he hoped to find her, viz., in the drawing-room. His hand was upon the handle of the door, but he paused to listen. Was he mistaken? No, that was surely Edith's voice, as she sung, As he did so, the door slightly creaked on its hingeB."], [363, "EDITH HERON. 357 low and sweetly, a few lines of an old nursery ballad. had entered, and which led on to a back stair case. A sneering smile curled the lip of her un natural half-brother as he said; \" Oh, solacing herself with her child, to while away the time, I suppose.\" In the meantime, Edith heard voices in the haU, and a hasty footstep ascended the grand staircase \u2014 a footstep which Edith did not recog nise. He opened the door quickly, and stood before the terrified mother. In another moment, Jonathan WUd stood be fore her, with a look of sorrow and compassion upon his features that she could not mistake, which at first made her almost doubt the evidence of her senses. A half scream burst from Edith's lips as she sprung to her feet, clutching, as she did so, at the covering beneath which lay her precious child. \" Ah 1\" said John Tarleton, \"have I startled you, Edith ? Pardon me, but I was so anxious to see you, that I forgot everything else.\" \"Edith,\" he said, \" thank heaven I am in time to save you and the child ! I meant not to have done this. I was maddened by drink and rage, or I should never have planned such a means as this of getting Felix Heron, if he be in Use, into my power!\" \" Wretch ! Leave me !\" \"Why, come now, that is scarcely hospitable, when I have come to show you that in all things I consult your fancies. See here, Edith, I have actually, knowing your predilection for knights of the road, become one of them. Look at me; do you not think the costume becomes me ?\" Edith was silent. \" What mean you, Jonathan WUd ? Was it you, then, who plotted our destruction in so fear ful a manner ?\" \"It was! it was! But I was not myself, I tell you, Edith! No sooner had Warringdale left me, than I repented, and hastened hither in order to put a stop to the fiendish project. For that, I am too late ; but not too late to save you and his little one !\" That brave heart shrunk from what might be in store for it to suffer; for well she knew that no help was at hand in that house. Oh, how she wished that Felix had not left her and his helpless child ! As Jonathan Wild spoke, he stooped over the child, who was sleeping peacefully, as though nothing uncommon were taking place around it. \" Come, speak to me, Edith,\" added John Tar leton. \"You surely do not bear malice?\" \" Can I ever forget, John Tarleton, to whom I am speaking when addressing you?\" asked Edith, with a shudder. Wild raised the child in his arms as gently and tenderly as a woman ; and taking Edith by the hand, he led her out upon the staircase. A puff of smoko met them, and the effect was so overpowering, that Edith staggered backward a pace or two. \" Why, your brother, to be sure ; and \" \" And the murderer of the father of my Felix !\" ' Oh, stuff ! I didn't come here to talk upon such gloomy topics.\" \"What then is your object, John Tarleton, in thus thrusting your unwelcome presence upon me?\" \"Not this way! not this way!\" cried WUd; \"follow me;\" and he turned and again entered the room they had just left, in order to reach the back staircase, through the door which John Tarleton had passed. Jonathan WUd seemed to know the house as well, or* better, than even Edith did, for he im mediately made his way towards the back stairs. Just as he did so, a heavy beam feU across their path, and cut off aU retreat in that direc tion. \" Merely this, Edith ; to tell you that I am just now desperately in want of money, and that I am resolved to have it from you before we part.\" \"And if I refuse?\" asked Edith, gazing steadily at her unnatural brother. \" Simply this, that you will be left to perish \u2014 you and your child \u2014 in tbo ruins of this old mansion. Accede to my demands, and I wiU save you both.\" \" We are, neither of us, in any danger,\" quietly replied Edith, although her heart sunk within her at she knew not what. But what was it that made Jonathan Wild gasp for breath, and almost let the child saU from his encircUng arms? What was it that made him turn to Edith, to see if she, too, had witnessed the fearful sight that had met his gaze as the faUing beam de scended? \"Ha! ha! ha!\" laughed John Tarleton. \" We shall see \u2014 we shall see. Even now I can detect the subtle smoke of the smouldering fire careering through the house.\" \"No, ho!\" he muttered to himseU; \"she is in ignorance of it. She saw not that form she loves so well crushed and bleeding beneath that burning beam !\" In truth, Edith had seen \u2014 had heard nothing. Her eyes were riveted on her beloved chUd ; for although Jonathan Wild appeared to wish to do all in his power to save her chUd, still she could not bring herself to trust that man who had so long persecuted both Felix and herself. But had she really seen the sight which had filled Wild with so much horror and regret, it would not so have affected her, for she knew that Felix was far away, whereas Wild, seeing only the scarlet coat, beUeved it to be none other than FeUx Heron. As he said this he approached the door and threw it open, and immediately there came into the room a dense body of smoke. \" Oh, heaven !\" shrieked Edith, \" what means this? John Tarleton\u2014 brother\u2014 speak to me! Help me ! Save my little one !\" \" Give me the money first.\" Bang! bang! bang! came at the outer door of the mansion. \"Felix!\" cried Edith\u2014 \" my Felix, save us, oh, save us !\" A sudden panic took possession of John Tar leton, who had a wholesome dread of encounter ing Felix Heron under any circumstances, more especially under the present ; and he turned and fled through a door opposite to that which he ''This way! this way!\" he shouted, dragging"], [364, "358 EDITH HERON. Edith after him. \" Hold, on to me Edith, and speak not. The grand staircase is of stone, and we may. yet descend, it in safety- Why, oh, why did I come this way,,?\" he almost shrieked. They retraced their steps, and when they reached the hall they encountered Mrs. Ogle and EUen, who were too much, alarmed to be able to R1_______________E \"You are safe, Edith,\" said Wild, as- they reached the door, of the mansion. \" Ah ! who is this? Ogle?\"' \"Lady Edith! Lady ,, Edith!\" was, aU Ogle could say, \" Take this child among you, and see that the Cohntess of Whitcombe is placed in safety some- where.\" \" To Lady Oastleneau's,\" said Edith, faintly; for now the reaction had begun to take place, and she felt as weak and helpkissas a chUd. \" Shall I go with you, Lady Edith ?\" asked Ogle. \"No \u2014 oh, -no! Call a hackney \u25a0 coach, and you, Ogle, watch for Felix to return, and break to him, as gently as may be, the _ad calamity that has overtaken us.,\" \" I will \u2014 I wiU, Lady Edith !\" And after seeing Edith and her child, with.Mrs. Oglo. and Ellen, j placed in a hackney coach, and giving the driver I, directions where they were to be taken, Ogle turned in the direction where he expected to see Heron and Tom Bipon return. \" I must walk briskly,\" said Ogle to .himself. \" I \"would not have . him come within sight of that burning pile for more than the world con- tains. The dread that some dire accident had happened to those he holds so dear would be too much for even his brave -heart.\" And what became of Jonathan Wild when he had seen Edith and her child safely bestowed in the hackney coach that was- to convey them in safety to Castleneau House ? Again he rushed into that burning house, and fearlessly made his .way to the back staircaap, in order again to. look upon that stiU silent form, which he beUeved to.be FeUx Heron. Wild clasped his hands over his eyes. \"Mr. Wild \u2014 Mr. Wild!\" shouted several voices. \" Where are you. Another minute, and you cannot be saved. Mr. Wild\u2014 Mr. Wild !\" \" Ah, they call \u2014 the men I brought with me to take him prisoner.\" \"Mr. Wild\u2014 Mr. Wild!\" again shouted some of his men, and two appeared at the head of the staircase. \"Here he is \u2014 here he is.!\" they shouted, as they leaped down the stairs, and between them raised Wild, and carried him out of what would most assuredly have been his grave. Jonathan Wild was perfectly passive in their hands. He had swooned. The moon had not risen. The sky, which had been calm and serene when Felix Heron and Tom Eipon hadJeft Whitcombe House, was now covered over with long lines of dark grey cloud, heavy and near the earth, when the two horse men entered a shady lane which led by a new cut across the country to London. It was a dim and 6ombre scene that met the eye of Felix Heron \u2014 unsatisfactory to the eye, but exciting to the imagination. Everything was vague and undefined in the shadows of that hour, and the long streaks of deeper and fainter brown which varied the surface of the land scape. A tall, soUtary, mournful tree might be seen here and there, adding to the feeUng ef vastness and solitude. It was an hour and a place fit for sad thoughts and dark forebodings, and Felix Heron sat upon Daisy in an attitude of one full of mournful re flections. He had sat there about a quarter of an hour, and so intently was he gazing around him that Tom did not venture to break the silence. There was not a breath of air stirring; no change took place in the aspect of the earth or sky ; it was- as if Nature were dead, .and the feeling seemed to become oppressive \u2014 contagious \u2014 for Tom Bipon hoaved a deep sigh- \" Alt, Tom !\" said Heron, in his kindly tones ; \" I had forgotten. I never pass this spot without a feeling of depression, for which I -can scarcely account. Let us, however, push forward.\" \" That's just what I was thinking, Captain : it would be better to get home, for the Lady Edith did not seem to- like our coming out much to night, and I think we may as weU get home as quickly as we can.\" \" We will \u2014 we will, Tom, for my heart is heavy, and I cannot account for the feeling. If I were superstitious, I should say I had-a presentiment of evil,\" added Heron with a smile, which, how ever, had very little mirth in it. Might he .not even , yet be able to drag him from his perilous position, and perhaps save his life? He would try. He soon found himseU kneehng by that figure, but, after many ineffectual attempts to remove the beam he gave . it , up, . for it would require much greater strength than he (Wild) unaided could bring to bear npon it. \" Help.! help !\" he shouted. The roar of the flames alone responded to hts cries. , \"Alas, alas, it is too late \u2014 too late, Felix Heron !, I never, dreamt of thus causing your death!\" he, murmured, , as he. sank almost ex hausted besido the dead. \" I intended only to force you , out\u2014 to . penetrate the. disguise you haye so long worn as Captain Fantome, and then to have arrested you ; for I wanted . above all other things to let you see that I was a match even for you, Felix Heron. Thoni when you felt and confessed that I had you entirely in my power, I would have stirred heaven and earth to have saved , ypu. Nay, if , necessary, I would have ransomed your Use with my own ; but it is too late\u2014 too lite \u2014 too late !\" FeUx Heron and Tom Ripon now put their horses to a gallop, nor drew rein uutU they were within sight of tho busy city. \" There has been, or is, a great fire some where,\" said Heron, as he looked up at the lurid sky; \" and mothinks I can hear the shouts of a multitude, as they gaze upon the wreok made by tho devouring clement,\" Tom was of the same opinion, and was most anxious to reach, the. scene .of confusion, that he too might beat, his part in the general commotion."], [365, "EDITH HERON. 359 i ; i I i i i Suddenly a sohtary figure wassseen running with the speed of Mghtninir ir, the contrary direc tion from whence could be heard the roar of voices.

A happy and contented party is assembled In that ancient breakfast-room, where so many scenes have occurred in connexion with this story of actual life. \"Safe! What mean you Ogle? That fire? Ah ! I see. It is Whitcombe House.\" It is true that Whitcombe House, so long the head-quarters, so to speak, of the earls of that name, is no more. Ogle drooped bis head, and Something Uke a sob burst from his Ups. \" The worst is over, Ogle. Where is Edith ?\" \" At Castleneau House, Captain.\" The flames -have done their work, -and that magnificent, although somewhat gloomy mansion, with all its associations, sad and happy, has passed away. \"And she was alone in Whitcombe House, Ogle?\" Is it regretted? No ! A thousand times, no ! On 'the contrary, about the eyes of Edith there is a Ughtness of expression, for although she had passed some happy hours in the old house at St. James's, it was at the same time associated with gloomy recoflections. \" Yes, Captain, but Jonathan Wild, by some means or other, arrived just in time to save her and the child.\" \"Jonathan Wild! Impossible! You amaze me, Ogle !\" \". It was even so, Captain, and he himseU was in such a state of grief, I may say, that I could scarcely beUeve my own eyes-\" \" It is strange,\" said Heron. \" Let us pro ceed.\" And did Felix Heron regret it? Certainly not. The world of his affections did not embrace bricks and mortar and the old stone portico of that family mansion. \u25a0 At this moment Ogle felt a rather rough twitch at his hat, and looking up, perceived Tom close to him. And when he looked about him- in the break fast-room of Castleneau House, and saw there all the human hearts he held dear, he felt that there waa nothing of which he could accuse Fate or Fortune in the shape of unhappiness. \" Now,\" cried Lady Castleneau \u2014 \" now, my dear children, let us hope that that .bold, bad man, Jonathan Wild, wfll be content, since he be lieves that you, Fe!ix,are no more.\" \" Where is EUen ?\" he asked, his voice trem bling with emotion. \" At Castleneau House, with Lady Edith,\" repUed Ogle. \" That is well !\" replied the boy. \" I feared almost to ask.\" ' Felix Heron now rode' on, leaving Ogle to foUow more at his ease, and arrived just in time to see the roof of the noble mansion fall in, bury ing within its ruins many objects of value that had been coUected through many generations within its walls. \" No, aunt,\" cried Heron ; \" beUeve roe, he will be far from -content; and I do not think any of you reaUy understand the kind of hostility Jona than Wild had against me.\" \" He sought your Use.\" \" Perhaps so, in the regular way. It is pro bable that, if we had fought, he would have tried to kill me.\" \" Let it go\u2014 let it go !\" sighed Heron ; \" there is more of unhappiness than happiness connected with that old mansion. I 'wfll not regret its loss, since I know my priceless treasures are in safety.\" \" He could not !\" exclaimed Edith. 41 Ah!\"' added Heron, \"you believe m\u00ab in vincible. Still, I believe he would have tri**d to kill me, although he would much have preferred taking me into custody, and letting me be- con demned to death in the regular manner.\" He turned Daisy's, head, and -putting her to a hard gallop, was soon ringing the great beil at Castleneau Horse, where old Anthony, frornthe speed with which he responded to the summons, seemed to have been watching for -him. \" You know all, sir?\"\"asked the old man, with affectionate sympathy. Edith shuddered. \"And then,\" added Heron \" I wfll hear no more,\" said Edith. \"lean- not contemplate such things.\" \"Nay, I was only going to say, 'And then I feel assured Jonathan Wild would have- striven might and main to save me.' \" \" All that has happened to Whitcombe House. \u2014 yes, Anthony ; but where is Edith ?\" \" In the Uttle breakfast parlour,\" replied the old servitor, \" with Lady Castleneau.\" Even as he spoke, Edith came out, and throw ing herself into his arms, sobbed forth her thank fulness and joy at again beholding him. \" And our little one, Edith T asked Heron, as soon as he could command his voice sufficiently to speak. \"Indeed!\" \" Yes, Edith, and you. aunt, Ukewise, I think you both judge wrongfully of that strange, eccentric man. He wants to conquer me, to overpower me, to hold me at his mercy; and then I beUeve -he would risk his own life rather than mine should be destroyed.\" \" Is weU, and Eleejaiig soundly,\" was the reply. \" But he thinks it destroyed now,\" said Lady Castleneau. \" Perhaps.\" Before Felix Heron could add another word, a"], [366, "EDITH HERON. 360 \" Partly.\" He made a gesture of impatience. \"But I did not intend it,\" he added, hurriedly. \" What's done, however, is done. It is past for ever, and may not be recaUed. I have now come to ask a question.\" \"What question? Ask it,\" cried Lady Castle neau, \" and then \" \"I know,\" said Wild. \"And then be off as quick as I can, you mean.\" Lady Castleneau inclined her head. Wild took from his pocket an immense, dingy looking handkerchief, and passed it twice across his brow before he spoke again. Then, in strange accents for him, because there was some emotion in them, be said, \" Where is the Earl of Whitcombe ?\" tap came at the door of the room, and old Anthony put in his head, with a scared look. \" Mr. Wild ! Mr. Wild !\" he cried : \" he is even now alighting at the gate!\" Edith turned pale, and sprang to her feet, clasping the child in her arms as though she imagined Wild could have no other errand than to tear it from her. Lady Castleneau put on a look of firm re solution. Heron 6iniled. \"Fly, Felix, fly!\" cried Edith. \"There is danger !\" \" I think not,\" said Heron. \" Whatever may be Wild's object in calling here, I do not think it 'involves danger to me. He either thinks me no more, or that I have escaped. Do you not re- member, aunt, that long ago I listened to an interview between you aud Jonathan WUd in this room, and was only separated from you by one of the folds of yonder screen ?\" \" Yes \u2014 oh, yes !\" \" It shall again hide me from him ; for although I might easily take bis Use, I will not do so, ex- cept under the pressure of some dire extremity.\" \" He is coming !\" cried old Anthony \u2014 -\"he is coming! I have looked out into the courtyard from the window on the staircase, and he is coming ! He did not stop to ring the bell, but clambered over the gate. Hush ! that's his foot- step in the hall!\" Heron glanced about him. He was anxious to leave no evidences of his presence that might meet the scrutinizing glance of Jonathan Wild. , Darting, thou, behind one of the folds of the screen, he was completely hidden. \"I ask that of you,\" replied Edith. \"Where is the Earl of Whitcombe ?\" \"Ah!\" said Wild, as he passed the handker chief across his brow again ; \" you ask that of me, do you ?\" \" I do, Jonathan Wild.\" \" Then I am sorry to hear it, and I have some thing more disagreeable to say still.\" He paused a few moments, and turned to wards Lady Castleneau. \" I think,\" he said) \" I would rather say if to you, for you have the courage of a man, and can hear something that would blanch ordinary cheeks, and strike ordinary people dead with grief.\" By the sUght movement of one hand that Jonathan Wild made, it was evident that he al luded to Edith. But she was strong in the consciousness of the safety of Felix Heron, and she spoke boldly and fearlessly. \"Say ou, Jonathan Wild; I am prepared to hear all that you can state, and I will try to be as courageous as my Aunt Castleneau in regard to whatever you may utter.\" \" The object,\" said Wild, \" of setting fire to Whitcombe House, was to ascertain if the Captain Fantome there residing with you was not in reality my old friend the Earl of Whitcombe himself in disguise.\" A faint flush came over the cheek of Edith. A heavy blow came upon the outer panel of the door. Old Anthony hastily opened it, and in a high, cracked, trembling voice announced \" Mr. Wild.\" Jonathan stood upon the threshold. At sight of Lady Castleneau aud Edith, he pulled off his hat with such a jerk, that it brought with it the eccentric and loosely fitting wig he usuaUy wore. Wild's wig was not ornmental, but without it he presented rather a hideous spectacle, from the numerous scars that were upon his bald head of sword-cuts ho had received in his many en counters with knights of the road. But the expression upon Jonathan Wild's face was something wonderful to see. It was positively human. His voice even faltered. \" And if it were so ?\" she said. \"That's an answer!\" said Wild \u2014 \"that's an answer !\" \" An answer to what ?'' \"To all my doubts and suspicions. Edith, Countess of Whitcombe, if you had taken twenty oaths that Captain Fantome and Felix Heron were one and the same person, you could not more perfectly have convinced me of the fact, than by that look, and those few words.\" \" Nay, Jonathan Wild.\" \" Hush ! You were there !\" He advanced in a stooping posture into the room. \" Lady Whitcombe,\" he said, \" and you, Lady Castleneau, you see me before you both, but not as an enemy.\" Lady Castleneau had risen and confronted Wild with that calm dignity of manner which had always had such an effect upon him. \"Jonathan Wild,\" she said, \"what want you He pointed down to the floor as he spoke. \" And now you are there !\" He pointed up to the ceiling. \"Perhaps you don't understand me. I'm not very good at saying things out of my own plain, blunt way ; but what I mean is, that you had sunk very low in my esteem as the wife of Cap tain Fantome, but he aud Felix Heron being ono and the same person, you rise again to your former height. You comprehend that ?\" \" I do ; but I have not yet said \u25a0\" here ?\" \" I will tell you. I want to banish a fear, and to awaken a hope.\" He looked wistfully at Edith as he spoke. \"The fire no longer blazes,\" ho added, \"and Whitcombe House is a mass of ruinsj' \" Your work,\" said Edith.

And now that justice seemed about to overtake him, there Avas a sensation of relief in both their mi ads, such as they had not experienced for many a long day. During the course of the morning at Castle neau House, the Earl of Bridgewater arrived with Colonel Trelawney. The destruction of the old. -mansion of tho Whitcombes, in St. James's Street, bad. created quite a sensation at the West End of the town. \" And Captain Fantome of tbe royal navy _'.' \"Blind! blind as a bat!\" yelled Wild. \"BUnd as a mole ! / not to know you !

There was a sharp rap at the door of tho room,. . \" Thank \u2022 bouven !\" exclaimed the Earl of Bridgewater, as hi. eye wandered from Felix Heron to Edith, and frdm liu again to the Uttle child, whom ho knew so weU \u2014 \"thank heaven, you are nil safe !\" Old Anthony looked in. \" Mr. Challener .'\" he said. There was a dead sfltaice for a Jew .seconds, during. which the persons assomjjlcd in that breakfast-room looked at each _>ther as if they would ask, who is Mr. Challener ? \" We are, Bridgewater,\" replied Heron ; \" and, believe me, we havo no regrets for tho bricks and mortar of old Whitcombe House.\" Heroo. rose from the chair he haditaken beside Edith, and. took one step towarda the screen again. \" Challener ! Challener !\" said Wild. \" Who is Challener?\" \" Who, then,\" said Colonel Trelawney, \"is the mysterious stranger in tho scarlet coat who now Una so grim and stark in death at tho ' Thatched Housa.Tavern' in St. James's Street?\" Old Anthony shook his head. A heavy footstep was heard in the haU. Wild drew himseU up to bis f .11 height, and glanced at the half-open door. A quiet, gentbmanly-loolring man appeared at it, and glancing round the room, his ayes settled upon Wihl. Edith glanced at Heron. Her face was very p.tle. He saw that she caught her breath convul sively. \" You. are avenged, Felix,\" she said ; \" aud, thank heaven, not by your own hand!\" \" What mean you, EJith ?\" \" It is tbe act of heaven, and I will not repiuu at it.

What would you have me to do 7' \"The advice, then, that we have to offer,\" added Bridgewater, speaking in a low tone, as if he feared his words might reach some hostile cars, even through the walls of that apartment, \u2014 \"the advice that we have to offer is that you seek an interview with the heir to the throne.\" \" Come, then, at once. As Captain Fantome, you can have no difficulty in accompanying me to the ' Thatched House.' T relit wney, you wfll walk with us ?\" \" With pleasure.\" Felix Heron only delayed to run up-stairs, and say a few words to Edith ; and then, with many instructions from Lady Castleneau to take heed of his personal 6afety, he departed on his gloomy errand. Three gentlemen stopped opposite old Whit combe House, and contempl a ted for a timo its still smouldering ruins. \" Indeed !\" \"Yee. You are aware, Whitcombe, that by the mysterious death of the Prince of WaloS; his son George, now only eighteen years of age, and residing in strict seelusion at Kew, will, upon the death of tbe present King, ascend the throne.\" \"Let it perish!\" said Heron. \" I could not like the house. I never knew the love of kin dred within its wall-.. The words tliat passed between me and my futlier beneath its roof were those of dissension, and never shall I forget one episode of my life in connexion with that house, which nearly crushed me utterly.\" \" Exactly ! But is it not probable he will be already prejudiced against me?\" \" Not so. He looks upon Trelawney and my self as his prime friends.\" \" That altere the case.'' \" It does materially ; aud we shall have no difficulty in procuring, an audience, either at thc Palace iu Kew Gardens, or somewhere else that Princo George may appoint.'' FeUx Heron alluded to tliat terrible time when, by tho arts and practices of Le Jeune and John Tarleton, he was reduced to doubt even the truth and constancy of Edith. \" I will be guided by you entirely,\" said Heron. \" I ask nothing for r.xyself ; but I wish that tbe titles and estates of Whitcombe should be as sured to my son.\" \" Oh, how blind I was !\" be exclaimed. \" I should have doubted my eyes, my ears, all my senses, and beUeved that they had risen up as traitors against my peace and happiness, before I should have doubted her.\" \"No, no!\" said the Earl of Bridgewater; \" that ./ill not do. Wa must have free immunity for all the past. You are yet a young man, Whit comhetsand the future of your Use must not be under a cloud, which would dispel much of its happiness.\" \"Come along,\" said Bridgowater. \"These are but gloomy fancies. Do not summon back eveuthe shadow of the clouds tbat have passed away.\" \"And here we are at the 'Thatched House,' \" said Colonel Trelawney. \"Ah, Mr. Staples, a fan morning to you ! We waut to see . that fellow who was dug out of tho ruins at Whitcombe House.\" Some further discourse now ensued with re respect to the best - plan of operations to arrange this meeting between Felix Heron and Prince Georgo. Lady Castleneau was taken into tho council; and it was finally arranged that Colonel Tre lawney, who waa on duty at Kew, and Who had acquirod great iofiuenoe over the young Prince, should sound him upon the subject of the pro posed interview, and- take his orders accord ingly. This being arranged, Felix Heron took Bridge water aside, and speaking to him with some \"Hem!\" said the landlord of the \"Thatched House.\" \" Really, gentlemen, knowing all your worships quite well, I am sure I'd gladly do anything to pleasure you ; but the coroner, or rather I should say the coroner's clerk \" \" Oh, never mind tho coroner or his clerk either,\" said Colonel Trelawney. \" We want to"], [370, "364 EDITH UKROX. identify tho body; so, you seo, wo are ou a legiti mate errand.\" \"I believe,\" said the landlord, looking at neron, \" I havo the distinguished honour of see ing, for the first timo in the ' Thatched House,' Captain Fantome, who married the Countess of Whitcombe ?\" \" It is a sickening spectacle,\" said Bridge- water. \" It is indeed,\" added Trelawney : \" lot us leave it.\" \" Yes,\" said tlio landlord ; \"and it's a vory bard case that they should have brought him to tho ' Thatched House;' for what's drunk downstairs at tho bar is nothing at all compared to the bother of an inquest, and all that sort of thing.\" Heron slightly inclined his head. Ho was scarcely aware that he was so well known to his neighbours as was really the case. \" Hush !\" said Bridgowater ; \" be quiet, all of sou.\" \" Come, come !\" said Bridgewater ; \" let us see the fellow !\" He held up his hand, demanding silence. They were all perfectly still, and a rather scared look sat upon tho countenance of tho landlord. Tho landlord of tho ' Thatched House' put on an air of preternatural cunning as he spoke: \" WeU, you must know, gentlemen, the coroner's clerk camo hero and put his seal on the door of tho room where the dead body lies ; but, gentle men, he was not exactly aware that there was another door. Ha, ha !\" \" What is it ?\" he whispered. \"Hush\u2014 hush!\" A confusion of voices was heard without. It appeared as if some one was demanding admission to that room, so carefully sealed up by the clerk of the coroner, and that the officials of the hotel were protesting against the in trusion. \" Precisely !\" said Trelawney. \" That is the great advantage of theso old houses. You have all sorts of doors, and exits, and entrances, iu evory direction.\" \" This way then, gentlemen \u2014 this way. Of course, you will say nothing about it?\" \" Not a word \u2014 not a word.\" A deep-toned voice 6poko, and although it could bo beard but indistinctly through the thick panelling of the ancient door, its tones struck upon tho ears of Felix Heron with a strange familiarity. Tho landlord of tho \" Thatched House\" led his guests up one of the back staircases, and from thence threading a number of intricate passages, they arrived in a small apartment that had evi dently been lorg used as a lumber-room to store away odds and ends of broken furniture. \" It's tbe next room to this,\" said the land lord ; \" and hero's a door that hasn't been opened,- I should almost think, since the houso was built.\" But yet he did not recognise the voice suffi ciently to givo a name to its possessor. \" Resist me at your peril !\" said the voice. \" I hold an order from tho Secretary of State to ex amine tho dead body that lies here, and, there fore, my authority over-rides all others.\" The Earl of Bridgewater now suddenly grasped the arm of FeUx Heron, and whispered in his ear. The landlord produced a bunch of old keys, and with 6ome difficulty fitted one to the lock, which turned with extreme difficulty. The door creaked upon its hinges, and let fall a cloud of dust, and with difficulty it was opened inward. \" You hear, Whitcombe \u2014 you hear ?\" \" I do.\" \" That voice \u2014 do you not recognise it?\" \" Scarcely ; I feel that I have heard it, but cannot name its owner.\" The room, in which lay the mutilated, charred body from tho ruins of Whitcombe House was a long, low-roofed apartment, probably thirty or .five-and-thirty feet in length, and eighteen or twenty in width. It had evidently been used for dinner parties, and the tables were ranged along the walls, so as to leave tbe open space in tho centre perfectly clear. \" It is a voice that I can never forgot ; and for the same reason that you could nevor forget, Whitcombe, the voice of him who lies still in death now boforo us.\" Felix Heron now understood what the Earl of Bridgewater meant. The name of tho person who was speaking without, came liko a slash of Ughtning to his mind. On ono of those tables, covered with a large coarso pieco of baize, lay an object, which, from tho outlines it presented, hud evidently once been human. \" Warringdale !\" he said. \" Yes,\" exclaimed the Earl of Bridgewater \"Tho murderer of your father lieB here boforo us, and is beyond human vengeance; but tho murderer of mine still lives, and it is his voice wo have just heard demanding admittance to this chamber.\" There is something even in the presence of death, when associated with those who in life aro least entitled to respect, that awes the bolder part. Folix Heron had good reason to Bupposo that the still form before him presented all that re mained of his father's murdoror. The landlord of the \" Thatched House\" looked alarmed. Tho tone and manner of the Earl of Bridgo water wero full of excitement \u2014 so much so, in deed, that Colonel Trelawney laid his hand upon his arm, as ho said, \" Be calm, Bridgewater \u2014 be calm \u2014 be calm, or you will know not what you do!\" And yet ho approached what might be called tho bier of John Tarleton with a look of so lemnity. The green baize was turned aside. Heron shook his head. There was a rustling at the door, and a voice, now undoubtedly recognised as that of Lord Warringdale, was hoard, iu louder accents. \" I will hold you harmless. I toll you again, \" No, no !\" ho said ; \" I cannot recognise those features \u2014 tho flames have done their work too effectively.\""], [371, "365 KDITH HERON. my authority is quite sufficient. Open the door, for I can no longer delay !\" \" What is to be done ?\" whispered Heron. \" Let us ascertain,\" said Cclorel Trelawney, \" what the vUlain wants here ; and to do that we must bo in secret. Come this way ; we can easily all of us hide on the other side cf this small door.\" which I verily believe \u2014 for the value of half tho estates of Whitcombe.\" As these words were spoken by Lord War ringdale, the Earl of Bridgewater whispered eagerly in the ear of Heron. \" You must have those papers, Whitcombe.\" \" Assuredly.\" \" I will get them for you.\" \" Thanks.\" A few seconds before the ordinary door of the apartment was opened to admit Lord Warring dale, our little party, as we may call it, retreated from the room in the occupation of the dead John Tarleton on to the narrow staircase up which the landlord of the \" Thatched House\" had brought ..hem.. \" No !\" whispered Colonel Trelawney. \" No ?\" \"I mean, let me get them. It is better for neither of you to interfere with that man. I shall be a much more disinterested witness than either of you.\" They closed the narrow door all but a crovice, and waited anxiously the appearance aud pro ceedings of Lord Warringdale. \" As you please, Trelawney,\" said the Earl : \"but I shaU have something yet to say to iny Lord Warringdale before he leaves tbat room.\" \" Be careful, Bridgewater \u2014 be careful. I can see by your eyes, and the flush of colour on your cheek, that your heart is full of excitement.\" \" Trust me,\" repUed the young Earl. \" But go, Trelawney, since you wish it, and take the papers from him.\" \" Certainly.\" Colonel Trelawney was a man of action. When he made up his mind to do a thing, it was done with that calm exhibition of power and resolution, which won half the battle before it was commenced. CHAPTER CCCIV. LORD WARRINGDALE RIFLES THE CORPSE OF JOHN TARLETON. \" Remain where you are !\" cried Warringdale to the officials of the tavern who had accompanied him to the room. \" Remain where you are ; I require no services.\" He closed the door upon thom. Then he thought himself alone with the He opened the little door at once, just suffi ciently wide te aUow him to pass into the room. dead. Warringdale heard the footstep. Ho uttered an exclamation of alarm. Alone with the man who had been bis unscru pulous associate while living, and who, now tbat lie was no more, was looked upon without regret. He made a rush at the door by which he had entered to escape, but bis own haste impeded him, and he forgot which way the door opened, in ward or outward. \" One by one,\" said Warringdale, in a low voice to himself, \u2014 \" one by one they go, and I am left alone, master of the field. Le Jeune is no more, and now John Tarleton ie but a sense less clod.\" The two seconds he lost were quite sufficient, for Colonel Trelawney. With a bound, the active officer reached War ringdale, and, seizing him by the shoulder, bo swung him round from the door, and stood be tween it and him. He stepped up to th-* table on which the body lay. He contemplated it then for some few mo ments in sUence. \" Not so fast, my Lord Warringdale,\" he said, \" I have a word to say to you before you go.\" \" To me, sir ?\" \"Even so.\" Then he spoke in a careless, jesting tone. \"Under ordinary circumstances, John Tarleton, to see you thus I should not have known you ; for, in good truth, the fire at Whitcombe House has not improved your beauty; and yet, even through aU its ravages, I fancy I can still detect the downward villanous look that always be longed to you. It is strange that so great a dif ference should be between the brother and sister ; for, antagonistic as I have ever been to her, I am free to confess that Edith is beautUul.\" Through the crevice of the door, Felix Heron and the Earl of Bridgewater could easUy com mand a good view of the proceedings of Lord Warringdale. \" Yes, in truth,\" added Warringdale, \" this is a strange meeting; and, however satisfactory it may be in some respects, it is one I do not wish to prolong.\" He busied himself about the corpse, and tear ing open the vest, he found a secret pocket, from which he extracted some papers. \" Good !\" he said. \" I would not have these fall bate the hands of that half-brother of mine, Felix Heron \u2014 assuming him to be stiU in life \" And who are you that dare \" \" I am Colonel Trelawney, of his Majesty's Guard.

It belongs to the infant son of Felix, Earl of Whitcombe !\" \" And is that,\" said Warringdale, with a sneer, \" the precious piece of intelligence that Colonel Trelawney, of his Majesty's Guard, has taken the trouble to come here and tell me ?\" \" No ; that has arisen incidentally. I am here to receive from you those papers you have just taken from the dead body of your rascally associate, John Tarleton, lying there.\" \" Ah !\" \" Be quick, sir !\" \" What papers ?

I know nothing, see nothing, and don't want.\" The landlord speodily made his exit, and then the young Earl of Bridgewater stepped forward, and spoke in a voice of great emotion and ani mation. \" It seems to me, Colonel Trelawney,\" he said, . and \" He paused a moment, and fixed his eyes on Felix Heron. \" That subterfuge will not answer your pur pose,\" said Colonel Trelawney. \" I must and will have them now ; and as for fighting you, that, you know, I wfll do, with the greatest pleasure in the world, at any time and place you may appoint.\" It was quite a chance that he had not pro- nounced that name, but he saw Heron's finger on his Ups, and then he added \u2014 \" It seems to me, Oaptain Fantome, that we are aU in the hands of a superior destiny, that shapes our actions according to its own wfll. We have frequently to do something which must ;be done ; but however- impelled we may be to do it, we cannot, and dare not, until the proper time arrives.\" \" This is an outrage !\" \"You are welcome to caU it what you will, but I must have the papers, and if you will not surrender them by fair means, I warn you that I mean to take them by foul\" \" There, then !\" \" Be calm, Bridg_w_ter,\" said Trelawney. \" I am calm, Colonel, but I know and feel that it has been my duty, and that the time would come when I must avenge my> murdered father.\" Lord Warringdale staggered back, and leant upon one of the tables for support. \"Am I to be assassinated?\" he gasped \u2014 \"as sassinated by you aU ?\" \" What matters it to you,'' said Oolonel Tre lawny, calmly, \"unless you happen to be the murderer of his father ?\" Warringdaletook from his breast pocket some letters and newsp_^>ers, and flung them on one _f the tables. \" No,\" said Trelawney. u What do you mean, sir ? You are incon sistent.\" \" Not at aU. The papers I require I saw you place in your left hand skirt pocket.\" Warringdale changed colour. \"And since,\" added the Colonel, \"you have so great a disinclination to part with them, I wfll end the matter thus.\" This logical speech of the young Earl's seemed to be anything but of a reassuring character to Lord Warripgdale. He stiU trembled and turned pale, and yet he was far from guessing at that moment the real extent of the danger that menaced him. He strove to put on an air of confidence, and to assume a courage that he did not feel. \" It appears, gentlemen,\" he said, \" that I am well known to you ; and if eo,s th\u00abre ean-fce no difficulty in finding me, if you wish to question my proceedings. The outragesto whioh I have \u25a0 already been subjected I shall of course report irr.the proper official quarter.\" Warringdale made again a movement to reach the door of the room, 'but the Earl of Bridge- water interposed between him and it. '< No !\" in a voice, he cried, that was strange even to Felix Heron, weU as he knew hia young friend the Earl \u2014 \" no ! I say again, the time has come !\" As he spoke, he drew his sword and rushed upon Warringdale, who expected nothing less than instant death. He raised yeUs of fear, and oalled loudly for help. But Colonel Trelawney had no such intention. Seizing the skirt of Warringdale's coat in his left hand, where he knew the papers he required had been deposited, he with one stroke of his aword, fairly severed it from the rest of the coat. \" That is sufficient,\"! he, said : \" you may now But Warringdale had called aloud for help, and when he did so, the Earl of Bridgewater had whispered to Eelix Heron, \" It is our turn now. Let us appear.\" From the look that was upon the countenance of the young Earl, Heron would fain have kept him back, but it was not possible to do so. Bridgewater strode into the room, and Heron had no resource but to follow him. \" What time ?\" gasped Warringdale. \" The time when I should be something worse I than a stick or a stone \u2014 a human clod, if I did I not cast off from my soul the 'weight that has for so long oppressed it!\" '^Be calm \u2014 be calm,\" again interposed Oolonel Trelawney. \" Nay, Trelawney ; this ie an opportunity that ' wfll not occur again. It is fate, I tell you, and I must embrace it\" \" You cried out for help, my Lord Warring dale,\" said the Earl ; \" pray what is thematter ?\" If Lord Warringdale had Been a spectre appear in answer to his call, he could not have been more astonished than ho was at the sight of the young Earl of Bridgewater. And tho landlord of tbe \" Thatched House \" tavern was so alarmed at the whole proceeding, that he thought his most prudent counse would be to leave the whole party to settle their affairs in their own way. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"you are all men of Again Warringdale moved towards the door. The young Earl, however, with flashing eyes, placed his back against it. \"Listen to me, aU of you '\" he said.

The Earl made a gesture, as though to com mand his silence, and continued : \" The act was, done long ago, and the reputation: of it fell upon the innocent head of Felix Heron !\" \" What then 7' \" I am quite certain he would not see me ex posed even to danger, or forced into conflict with any man on such a subject.\" \" You believe tliat ?\" added Trelawney. \" I do. On my soul, I do.\" \" Keep the door, Bridgewater.\" \" I mean to do so.\" \" Hear me \u2014 hear me!\" said Warringdale. \" Hear him !\" interposed Colonel Trelawney. \" Let him be the blackest criminal the world ever saw, he is entitled to a hearing.\" \" I ask but one question,\" said Warringdale. \"Is the witness alive that I would call to exone rate me from this charge ?\" \" Then, gentlemen,\" added Colonel Trelawney, \" I wiU take you into my confidence upon so singular a subject, that it may weU excite your ' admiration and even your increduUty.\" \" Witness alive ? What mean you ?\" \"I speak of that Felix Heron yod have.just mentioned. Does ha live? \u2014 for if he does, I Would cite him to appear, to say no to this mon strous charge !\" Heron at this moment stepped farward, and so confident waste in his disguise as Captairt Fan f'lroe, that he had no hesitation in submitting himself freely to the observation of Lord War ringdale. CHAPTER CCCV. THE FALSE ACCUSER M\u00a3_-3 WITH UTS DESERTS. Colonel Trelawnet pronounced these words in so mysterious a tone of voice, that -neither Felix Heron ner the Earl of Bridgewater knowing , what his plans were, looked at him with surprise and expectation. As regarded Lord Warringdale, he knew not whether to extract hope or fear from the manner of the Colonel, but he listened with the most ab sorbed attention to what might follow. They looked at each other earnestly. It is well known to the reader that Warring dale had been of opinion, along with Jonathan Wild, that FeUx Heron was still in Use, and if he were so, he could only be identical with Captain Fantome. And never had Warringdale obtained so good a look at his half-brother in that admirably got-up disguise. And never had Heron so fully succeeded in putting on a look and expression entirely dif ferent from his own, as upon tbat occasion. He managed to settle himself down, likewise, in a manner that took several inches off his height. u It's weU known to you all,\" added Tre lawney, stiU speaking in the same mysterious voice, \u2014 \" it is weU known to you all that I have traveUed in the East ; aud, while in Egypt, I got accidentally into communication \u2014 in consequence of saving his life \u2014 with one of those extraordi nary men who seem, in some manner, to havo gathered together the lost links of that mighty chain of occult knowledge only known to the seers of antiquity.\" Warringdale waa gathering courage. When people began to talk in that way, he thought there could not be much danger to him. The Earl of Bridgewater was more composed, for, from an occasional glance that Colonel Tre lawney gave him, he was quite convinced. that what was being said and done was exactly in tho direction he wished. Warringdale was baffled. All the vague suspicions of the identity of Captain Fantome with Felix Heron seemed to scatter to the winds before this ocular demon stration that such could not be the case. He breathed more freely. A great weight seemed to be Ufted off his mind, and his voice was more free from embar rassment, as he spoke. \"My Lord Bridgewater,\" he said, \"you have nourished now for some years this terrible aad injurious suspicion regarding me.\" \" I have ; and I nourish it still.\" \u2022 \" It has been fostered, I know well, by the cunning and duplicity of Felix Heron.\" The Earl of Bridgewater was about to make some violent reply to these words, but Oolonel Trelawney stopped him. \" Hold !\" he said. \" It is but right and just that we shotdd hear what this man has to say. Ia what way, my Lord Warringdale, can you exonerate yourself from suspicion of this fearful crime ?\" \"In this way,\" said Warringdale. \"Felix Heron himself confessed his guilt !\" Again the Earl was about to speak furiously, but again he was hushod to silence by Colonel Trelawney. \"Upon what occasion,\" he said, \"did FeUx Heron confess himself tho perpetrator of the murder?\" \" But the most extraordinary piece of know ledge,\" added the Colonel, \" that I acquired at \u25a0 that time, and from that person, was a secret formula, or set of words in the old Sanscrit dia lect, which would suffice to bring before me the spirit of any one who had departed this Use.\" Warringdale stalled. \" I propose to try the experiment,\" added Colonel Trelawney. \" In what way ?\" \" I think if I should be successful in summoning before us in his image, as he Uved, this Felix Heron, we might get the truth as regards this unabsolved, unavenged crime.\" \"Oh, this is midsummer madness !\" cried War ringdale. \" The thing is too absurd \u2014 and here in broad daylight, too 1\" \" But if it were possible ?\" said the Earl of i Bridgewater. \"IoverheaTd him by chance confess ii 1o his \" Then I feel confident,\" added Warringdale."], [374, "EDITH HERON. 368 is sufficient if he answer tho tribunals of his country, and not private individuals.\" \" that I should be immediately absolved and ex onerated from all part in the murder \u2014 if murder it were. But the thing is, I say, too absurd. You were deceived by your Egyptian seer, Colonel Trelawney, aud it cannot be.\" Trelawney shook his head. \" Answer me one question,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater, who began now thoroughly to see the drift of his friend. \" Did you ever try the experiment of a repetition of those strange and terrible words ?\" \" It is enough ! I will summon tbe spirit.\" Lord Warringdale turned as pale as death, and caught his breath now convulsively as Co lonel Trelawney spoke, using a strange jargon of unmeaning words, which might pass for San scrit, or any other obsolete tongue. And during all this time Felix Heron had been an attentive listener from the other 6ide of the small door that led to the staircase. \" I did.\" It needed no further explanation to enable him thoroughly to understand the part he was to play. \"And the result?\" \" It came.\" During the few minutes he had been there he had divested himself of the wig, and carefuUy rnbbed off some of the lines upon his face which had so effectually disguised him a3 Captain Fantome. \"It? What it?\" \" The spirit that I summoned.\" Lord Warringdale turned pale, and again grasped the edge of the table for support. There was a consciousness in his mind that all this boded no good to him, but in what precise way it was to affect him he scarcely, as yet, knew. By throwing likewise open tho lappels of his coat, he imparted to himself quite a different appearance ; and any one who had once seen FeUx Heron undisguised and in his own proper person, could not have failed to recognise him instantly. And who knew him so well as Warring dale ? Felix Heron, however, and the Earl of Bridge water were, by this time, perfectly well aware of Colonel Trelawney's mode of action, and they were prepared to second him to the utmost of their power, \" My opinion is,\" said the Colonel, \" that a man possessed of such means as I have of sum moning so awful a witness, should exercise it sparingly, and never wantonly.\" \" This is all absurd,\" cried Warringdale. \" You think so ?\" Heron heard Colonel Trelawney use the out landish words. He felt that they were the signal for his ap pearance. Opening the small door instantly, he took two steps into the room. \" Most assuredly I do ; and any rational man would think so likewise.\" Warringdale's eyes were fixed in that direc tion. \" But since this spirit of FeUx Heron, which I propose to summon, seems, by your own ac count, to be a witness in your favour, you can have no objection to the experiment ?\" It needed but one glance to convince him that there stood before him the veritable Felix Heron. That half-brother .to whom he had been so bitter an enemy. The generous man, who, with such abundant incentive to kill him, had on so many occasions spared his life. He could not speak. Terror froze his faculties, and he could only glare at the seeming apparition in mute despair. \" Speak !\" said Colonel Trelawney \u2014 \" speak, Felix Heron ! Did you ever confess to this man that you were the accidental murderer, or the designing one, of the late Earl of Bridge water ?\" Warringdale hesitated a moment, and then uttered but one word \u2014 \" None !\" He strove, by putting on an appearance of bravado, to give himself the only hope there could be of escaping from the present predicament. Then Colonel Trelawney spoke again with mysterious and low tones. \" Captain Fantome,\" he said, \" you will oblige me by going out at that door.\" He indicated tbe little door that led out on to the staircase. \" Never !\" said Heron. Heron left the room at once. \" Let me go !\" shrieked Warringdale. \" Let me go ! I wUl stay here no longer ! A plot ! a plot ! It is my life that is sodght ! I appeal to the law ! If I am accused of a crime, let the law decide my guilt or innocence ! I appeal to the law of the land ! I wfll not stay here to be baited by beings either of this world or an other !\" \" My Lord Bridgewater !\" then added Colonel Trelawney, \"you wUl leave by that other door.\" The young Earl obeyed him Warringdale was alone with Trelawney, who spoke to him earnestly. \" Will you abide this trial ?\" he said. \" Will you now, before tbe spirit of another world ap pears, call upon heaven to witness to your inno cence of the charge brought against you ? But I want you, before you speak, tbat if you do so with a consciousness of guilt at your heart, tbe consequences may be far more fearful than you can imagine.\" Warringdale he.'.ated. : \" Speak !\" He rushed past Colonel Trelawney, and reached the ordinary door of the apartment through which the Earl of Bridgewater had so recently gone ; and so sudden was his movement, that he evaded tho grasp of the Colonel, and perhaps even then might have escaped, but that he fell exactly into the arms of the Earl of Bridge water, who was on the landing. And sooner would Warringdale have encoun tered one of the wildest creatures that ever made its home in a forest, than that accuser. \" I will not be catechised in this way.\" \" That is enough.\" \" When a man is accused of a great crime, it He recoiled into the room again."], [375, "EDITH HERON.

Warringdale looked about him like a wolf at bay. \"You shall fight,\" added Colonel Trelawney ; \" or we wfll leave you to the consequences of the No- 99. \u2014 Edith Heron, 369"], [376, "EDITH HERON. 370 long-cherished vengeance of the son of a mur dered father !\" The expression of his countenance was some thing fearful to sec in the concentrated hatred that sat upon it. Heron rose, with a sigh. \" He has died as he Uved,\" said Colonel Tre lawney ; \" false as any fiend that ever disgraced the Ukeness of man.\" Then Warringdale glared about him, and tbe conviction came over his mind that there was no escape. His last hour had either come, or by some for tunate chance he must succeed in taking the life of the young Earl of Bridgewater. \" It is justice,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater, as he sheathed his sword. \" This is justice, Heron. There Ues the murderer of your father, and there the murderer of mine.'' Or, perhaps, he might escape with some wound of too serious a nature to enable the contest to be continued. But be that as it may, he saw in the implacable eyes of thoso men around him the fact that fight he must. \" Let them rest together, \" said Heron. \" I cannot blame you, Bridgewater, although the man was of such close kindred to myseU. I have often prayed that he might not saU by my hand ; and, now that he is no more, I feel a weight lifted off my heart which has sat upon it for many a year.\" \"Come away, both of you, \" said Trelawney : \" this is no place for us ; and I should advise, that when we see Prince George, at Kew, we mak. him a confidant of aU these circumstances. \" The Earl of Bridgewater quietly took up his position at one end of the room. Oolonel Tre lawney leant his back against the deer, which was the ordinary mode of entrance. Felix Heron imitated him se far as to take pos session in the same way of the Httle narrow door leading to the obscure staircase. \" Now !\" said the Earl of Bridgewater. He advanced upon Warringdale, -.vbo reluc- tantly drew his sword. \" Heaven defend the right!\" cried Heron. \" Amen !\" said Colonel Trelawney. The swords clashed together. CHAPTER CCCVI. Warringdale had but one hope, and that lay in the state of extreme excitement which was visible in every movement and in every look of the Earl of Bridgewater. FELIX AND EMTH AGAIN EECOME TOIl's DEBTORS. It was on that eventful evening on which Felix. Heron had, by the advice of his best friends, gene to Kew, there to seek an interview with the heir to the throne of England, that strange occur rences were taking place in the usuaUy quiet mansion of Castleneau House. \u2022 Moreover, a slant of sunhght came into the room at that inopportune moment, pouring full upon the face of the young Earl. Warringdale took advantage of the accidental circumstance, and made so furious an assault that he wounded the Earl of Bridgewater in his left arm, ripping up with his sword's point the sleeve of his coat at the same time. It is about seven o'clock in the evening, and Lady Castleneau and Edith are seated in thfif drawing-room which is already so well .known to the reader as being so intimately associated wi'.h some of the most interesting episodes of this history. Perhaps thc sweetest hour of a sweet season is that which precedes the setting of the sud. All the world is taking holiday. The aspect of the sky and earth too, clear, calm, and to_.qu.il, are lull of repose. The mistiness of the mid-day sunshine is away, and the very absence of a por- tion of the fuU daylight, and the thin, colourless \u25a0transparency <f the evening air, afford that con- templative, but no way drowsy, charm which well precodes, by thought tending to adoration, the hour when, in darkness and forgetfulness, we trust ourselves unconscious to the hands of God. Tbe wound was slight as regarded the Earl. Bnt it was fatal to Warringdale. There was a slight entanglement of his sword's point in Bridgewater's sleeve ; and that pause, although it was but for a couple of seconds, ended the conflict The Earl of Bridgewater shortened his right arm ; and, pressing forward, heedless of the wound he had received, ran Warringdale through the body a_ cleanly as though he had stood up to have the c aeration performed upon him without attempting Lo defend himself. A shudder pervaded the frame of Warring dale. \"Enough!\" cried Trelawney. Warringdale stood, then, for the space of another moment or two, and then fell heavily back, leaving the blood-stained sword in the hands of the Earl of Bridgewater. \"It is over!\" said FeUx Heron, as he knelt down and looked in the face of Warringdale. \" He lives still ; but his life is ebbuig fast. Con fess, Warringdale' I call upon you at this awful moment not to leave the world with defiance and untruth on your lips. Confess the murder with which you are charged ; and seek that Eternal Judge, in whoso presence you will soon stand, with tho word repentance on your lips.\" Warringdale made a dying effort. \"A fable!\" he gasped \u2014 \"you did it! Ha, ha! Yon did it !\" The heart of man is but as an instrument from which the great musician, Nature, produces grand harmonies ; and the most, soothing anthem that arises within the breast is surely elicited Ly the soft touch of tbat evening hour. There was in tbe heart of Lady Castleneau a deep memory, a powerful feeliDg, which lisa their harmonious connexion with that particular hour, and with that particular room; and as Bhs gazed, and saw the sun 6inkirg slowly in tho west, one image, one sensation took possession of her bosom. She thought of him \u2014 the lover of her girlhood \u2014 who, in that very room, at that very hour took leave of her he hoped, in one short year to make his happy wife. Those woro his last words."], [377, "371 EDITH HERON. her hand, saying, as she did so, \" Anthony, are you there, and alone ?\" \"Yes, my lady. He overpowered me, in\u00a3 locked me in here.\" She spoke not ; she tried to suppress the feel ing \u2014 or, rather, to indulgo tho feeUng, while she suppressed ita expression. Lady Oastleneau's eye was tearless, but her brow was sad ; and as she withdrew her gaze from the setting son, and turned her looks upon Edith, it was with a sigh. Edith, too, had been recaUing some of the events of her past life ; and as she regarded the high-souled gentlewoman beside her, and remem bered how true a friend she had ever been to her and to Felix, she cast her arms about ber, and kissing her cheek, said, \" Dear aunt, you are sad and' silent to night ! May I not share your thoughts ?\" \" It is past, dear child,\" replied Lady Castle neau, returning her cares-;. \" I was but thinking of what might have teen, had not heaven or dained it otherwise.\" Lady Castleneau opened the door. \" TeU me, Anthony, how long ago is it since this happened ?\" \" About half an hour, my lady.\" \" So long !\" saidLadyCastleneau, thoughtfully. \" Come with me, Edith ; we must talk over this matter seriously, and see what is to be done.\" At this moment a scene of terror and alarm was taking place in another part of the mansion, and when Lady Castleneau and Edith once more reached the drawing-room, the sounds were unmistakably those of grief \u2014 wild, unchecked, heart-wrung grief \u2014 that Edith and her aunt looked at each other in mute astonishment, each fearing to ask the other, \" What can this mean?\" It was Edith who first spoke. \" Let me go, dear aunt, and ascertain what aU. this commotion can be about?\" \" Ah, 1 see !\" 6aid Edith ; \" you are thinking of your girlhood's days ; and will you not no w, dear aunt, tell me something concerning that por trait which hangs in yonder room ?\" \" No, no \u2014 not to-night, dear Edith \u2014 not to night! I know not why my thoughts recur to the past, as they do of late. Perhaps \u2014 perhaps, Edith, it is because I am soon to join those who have gone before.\" \" Oh, speak not so, dear \u2014 dear aunt !\" cried Edith. \" What \u2014 oh, what would your Edith do without your kind guidance and fond affection ?\" \"My Edith?\" saidLadyCastleneau. \"When a woman- marries a man of such high intellect and such deep affections as are blended in Felix, that woman no longer requires any other arm to lean upon, or any other adviser.

Anthony is \" Lady Castlenoau and Edith both sprung to their feet A dread of they knew not what took possession of their hearts. \" What of Anthony ?\" asked Lady Castleneau, endeavouring to speak calmly-. \" Is shut up in the room where Lord Clacking ton was, and we cannot open the door !\" \" He has escaped !\" said Edith. Lady Castleneau turned calmly to the servant who had just entered, and telling her to precede her with a candle, mode her way, accompanied by Edith, to that disused suite of apartments which had formed, for the time, a temporary Lady Castleneau had sunk into a chair, anfl merely assented to Edith's proposition by a look. Another moment, and Edith had left the room, \u2014 and then there was one piercing shriek \u2014 a murmur of voices \u2014 some hurried footsteps, and then all was still. Lady Castleneau rose to her feet. \" Heaven help me now !\" she murmured, s\u00bb she left the room. In tho hall, a spectacle met her gaze winch was weU calculated to make her heart stand still. On the floor of the hall, half-supported \"oy Martha and Ellen, lay Edith in a death-Uko swoon; while old Anthony,' with clasped hands, approached his mistress, but was unable to arti culate a word. \"What is the cause of this?\" asked Lady Castleneau, pressing her hand upon her heart. \" What has caused this death-Uke swoon ? Tell me, Anthony ! Keep me no longer in sus pense !\" \" The child, my lady ! \u2014 Lady Edith's child is nowhere to be found !\" \" Merciful heaven !\" exclaimed Lady Castle neau. \" What new grief is in store for us ?\" Edith was raised from the floor, and conveycl back again to the drawing-room, which she haS so lately left For the time being, aU other thoughts were absorbed in the all-engrossing oa* of her recovery.

There was some thing about the furtive glances which the man cast about him, which drew Tom'B attention to him ; for he stood aside and watched him ; and just as he approached the spot where Tom was in hiding, the child struggled to free itself from the folds of the cloak, and caUed out ' Mamma ! Ellen !' in the, to Tom, unmistakable accents of little Arthur.\" a low voice. \" Aunt dear aunt, tell me, have they yet dis covered any tidings of my child?\" \" Hush !\" said Lady Castleneau, bending over her, affectionately ; \" be stiU. We aU hope for the best.\" \" And Felix \u2014 has he returned ?\" \" Not yet, dear Edith.\" The effort bad been too much for Edith, and she could say no more, but lay passive as an in fant. Lady Castleneau drew a long breath. \" This was sufficient, you may be sure, for Tom. He strode out of his hiding place, and confronted Clackington, holding a pistol to his head as he cried out, ' Hold hard, there ! What are you doing, my Lord Clackington, with that child ?' As soon as Arthur heard Tom's voice he made a desperate struggle, and succeeded in freeing himseU from Clackington's grasp. This was all Tom wanted, for he was alone ; and he thought with the charge of Arthur he would be no match for his lordship, so he wisely determined to let him off, and to be satisfied with getting possession of the child, who clung to him as to a well-remembered friend.\" Suddenly she started up. \" He comes ! I hear him, aunt !\" There was, indeed, a footstep on the staircase, which the wife's ear had not failed to catch, but which had escaped that of Lady Castleneau. There was a pause at the chamber door ; and then a well-known voice was heard to say, \" Joy never kills ! Look up, my Edith ! Our Uttle one is safe, and here, closely clasped in my arms. Here, Edith\u201elove ; kiss him, and believe that all is weU.\" With a cry of joy, the little one was folded in his mother's fond embrace. \" Tell me \u2014 oh, tell me how you came to know \" Clackington, it seems, saw his advantage, and took to flight, leaving Tom master of the field. \" Thank heaven !\" saidLadyCastleneau. \"I will now go to Edith.\" \" And I wUl go with you, dear aunt ; for I, too, am most anxious to see them both again.\" As Felix and Lady. Castleneau entered Edi tb's chamber, their hearts throbbed with deUght to hear again the gentle tones of Edith's voice, talking to her newly-found treasure. Little Arthur, too, was doing his share of con versation ; and on seeing Felix Heron he held out his little arms, exclaiming, \" Here comes papa ! Look, mamma ! He is not going out any more to-night.\" \" I know all,\" said Edith, looking at FeUx, and then smiling at EUen, who was standing by the bed-side. \" How shall we ever be able to repay Tom the debt of gratitude we owe him.\" \" Oh, that wiU not be so very difficult, I fancy,\" said Heron, glancing mysteriously at Ellen, wbo immediately withdrew behind the shadow of the curtain. \" I think the best way wfll be to make him a present of Ellen, there, and let her teU him all we think about him.\" \"Hush, dear one \u2014 not now. Suffice it tbat your darling is restored to your arms. Ask no questions now, as you love me,\" said Felix, bending over her fondly. With the habitual gentleness which ever characterized Edith wheu Felix Heron expressed a wish, she laid herself gently back on the pillow, still clasping her darling in her arms, and seem ing to have no other wish on earth but to gaze into those innocent eyes. Felix now made a sign to Lady Castleneau, and, turning to Edith, he said, \" I wUl return in a short time, Edith ; and then you must consent to part with that little fellow, as you are keeping him awake much beyond his usual bedtime.\" There was a iight-heartedness about Felix Heron which imparted itself to Edith, and she cheerfully assented to his leaving her in charge of Ellen. As soon as Felix and Lady Castleneau were left alone, the former, taking her hand, said, \" I know bow anxious you are to know how it was that I should be the happy means of restoring my Edith to herself.\" \" Yes, yes, Felix ; tell me how and where you found the child.\" \" What say you, EUen ?\" asked Edith, in the same strain. \" Are you willing to become the exponent of our feelings towards Tom ?\" What answer the blushing Ellen might have made must stUl remain unknown ; for when Edith drew aside the curtain, Ellen was gone. She had made her escape froni that room, her heart thrilUng with every joyful emotion. \" Is that the way you pass me, Ellen ?\" were the first words which greeted her ears, as Tom laid his hand upon her arm, and gently detained her \" I will. Again, dear aunt, have we to thank that brave boy, Tom Ripon. It was he who saw and recognised Clackington as he was hastening from the house with the child beneath his cloak, evidently in search of a vehicle which would convey him and my child to some place of con cealment.\" Lady Castleneau seemed almost overwhelmed with this intelligence. \" I cannot understand \" she began. \" And I can scarcely enter into particulars now, dear aunt ; for I heard only a few hurried par ticulars from Tom, who was as anxious as I was to relieve Edith's mind, but was afraid to do so until he had talked the matter over with me. \" Oh, don't \u2014 don't keep me now, Tom ! dear Tom\u2014 I\u2014 I \" \" Why, what's the matter, EUen ; don't you love me to-night ?\" This was too much for the gentle girl, who had gone through so much during the last few hours,"], [379, "373 EDITH HERON. 1 i and she burst into a flood of tears which were finished, however, upon Tom's shoulder, and the brief half-hour which succeeded those tears was perhaps one of the happiest of her life, for she felt that she loved and was beloved, and what more does the heart require in this world than that blessed assurance ? Felix Heron could not but be observed by those trustworthy and affectionate friends who were with him. \"Cheer up, Whitcombe!\" said Colonel Tre lawney. \" You have nothing to regret.\" \" NothiHg,\" said Heron. \" Then throw aside aU consideration of the past. Turn your attention to the present and the bright and radiant future, for something seems to teU me that all will be well with you.\" The Earl of Bridgewater was still in a state of excitement and he spoke rather gloomily. \" I think I shall go to Vienna,\" he said, \"until all this affair is blown over.\" CHAPTER CCCVII. HERON AND HIS FRIENDS PAY A VISIT TO PRINCE GEORGE AT KEW. \"Nay,\" interposed Trelawney; \"it is a fair fight with two credible witnesses.\" \"It was so!\" exclaimed Heron; \" ar_d, as heaven will judge us aU upon this account, we cannot be accused of the slightest unfair conduct in regard to that man.\" \" But yet,\" said Bridgewater, \" there may be some disturbance about it. I, too, have my enemies !\" It is now necessary that we should more spe cially record to the reader the particulars of the visit of FeUx Heron and his attached friends to the young Prince George, at Kew, immediately after the death of Lord Warringdale, Some remarkable changes had taken place in the position of Felix Heron and those who were dearest to him on earth. The sudden and awful death of John Tarleton, although it certainly was an event which made no material change in the prospects of Heron and Edith, yet removed a weight and sense of oppression from the mind of the former which had sat there long. The struggle which had taken place in his feelings between the urgent desire to take sum mary vengeance for the murder of his father, and his shrinking horror of taking the life of Edith's brother, had been painful and intense. But now all that had passed away. \" Come, come !\" added Trelawney, \"you must not take too serious a view of this affair. I pro pose that we at once go to the young Marquis of Ormond. You know, Whitcombe, he occupies an official position there now.\" \"Do not let us involve him in any of our troubles,\" said Bridgewater. \" Certainly not ! But I am sure he will think himself very much neglected \u2014 always bearing in mind his great friendship and romantic affection for Whitcombe \u2014 if we do not take him into con sultation as to what is to be done.\" \" But you still adhere to your advice,\" said Heron, \" that we should proceed to Kew as quickly as possible on our visit to Prince George ?\" \" I do.\" John Tarleton was no more. He had met his death as he deserved to meet it, in the pursuit of one of those nefarious and villanous plans which helped to make up the sum of his existence. \" And you think we should take Ormond with us?\" But if the death of John Tarleton was a re lief, as regards Heron's domestic Use, how much more so was that of his half-brother, the so called Lord Warringdale? By a strange coincidence, one of his most no table offences had been a murder, partaking very much in its character of that which Tarleton had committed. \" Of that I am quite convinced. He is a great favourite with the young Prince, and may look forward to some of the highest offices of the State.\" \" Then let us proceed at once. I am only too anxious, for the sake of those who feel deeply interested in my weUare, to carry out any sug gestion that may put an end to the sea of troubles which has so long surrounded me.\" The distance to the lodgings at Warwick House of the young Marquis of Ormond was but short But the young Earl of Bridgewater had none of the considerations which had swayed Heron in sparing the murderer of his father. And now that half-brother was no more ; and Heron, strange to say, felt a sensation which, but for those dear ones he had at home, would have partaken of loneliness. He felt that he stood, so to speak, the last of his race; and in all the wide world there was not another Whitcombe, so far as he knew, in exist ence who could claim kindred with him. But regrets were in vain. He did not fashion the mind and heart of Lord Warringdale. \u00b0 . . . _\u00bb_ _e i_r.j. ] . V.- The Uttle party soon occupied a handsome apartment in that semi-regal establishment Then with that perfect sense of security among gentlemen of honour, that anything and every thing can be communicated freely and without reserve, the young Marquis was made acquainted with aU that had taken place at the \" Thatched House Tavern.\" He took precisely the same view of the cir cumstances that Colonel Trelawney had done. \" There was everything,\" he said, \" to consti tute a fair -fight. The weapons were equal, and two gentlemen of unblemished honour and re putation acted as seconds. What on earth more would Lord Warringdale desire ?\" \" Yes,\" added Colonel Trelawney, with a sUght smile, \" you are quite right Ormond, and I The mysterious secrets of Nature, and the hidden aims of Providence, by which such men are created, and play their part in the drama of existence, were not to be questioned by Heron. Warringdale was no more, and gladly would Felix Heron have forgotten his existence, bury ing alike in obUvion his crimes and their terrible retribution- The sadness that spread itself over the face of"], [380, "EDITH ncr.nN. 374 stink Lord Warringdale must be hard to please, iadeed, if he be not abundantly satisfied. \" \" Let us to Kew at once ; the day is wearing \u00bbn,\" remarked Heron.* The young Marquis had no difficulty likewise in mounting his friends well from the stables of Warwick House, and the party of foor gentlemen went at a sharp trot to the beautiful old palace amid the shadowy groves of the far-famed gar dens of Kew. \" But yet listen to me, Ormond, a moment,\" arid the Earl of Bridgewater. \" What is it you would say ?\" \"Just this \u2014 that I fear by appearing before the ycung Prince at present I may prejudice the \u00ab__se'of my friend Whitcombe.\" \" Not in the least.\" The evening was rapidly approaching as they neared the ancient red-brick building now so utterly deserted by royalty. The name of the Marquis of Ormond was a passport immediately to the Prince's .presence. In a rather large apartment looking out upon one of the pleasant lawns of what was called the private garden of the palace, they found a youth, who, as George the Third, reigned for so many years over England. The young Marquis made himself spokesman, and very briefly, but with sufficient clearness, detailed the whole story oonnected with FeUx Heron. \"That is really your opinion, then, Ormond ?\" * It is, and I will tell you all why .\" The Marquis of Ormond glanced around him auspiciously before be again spoke. He then lowered his voice to a whisper. \"If tho old saying be true, that walls have ears, those walls must certainly belong to palaces ; bat I am quite certain, speaking in the tone I do a. w, that no word I utter will reach any other persons than those to whom they are addressed.\" Neither Heron, Trelawney, nor the Earl of Bridgewater could form any notion of what She young Marquis of Ormond meant to say. Bnt he continued speaking in, if possible, a lower tone than before. The episode at the \" Thatched House\" wasnot forgotten. At the conclusion of the narration the Prince seemed to reflect a little. Then, prooeediug to the window, he said, very quietly, \" What sort of a summer do you think we shall have, my Lord Whitcorabe ? \u2014 eh? eh ?\" Prince George's manner partook very much of those peculiarities of style which became so marked and observable as he advanced in Use. \"It is one of the most singular thoughts con nected with your destiny, Bridgewater, tbat Prince George will have the keenest possible sympathy with you.\" \" Indeed !\" \" A warm summer, your Highness,\" repUed Heron. \" Yes, he will almost wish that he had been in your place at the 'Thatched House;' and, instead of Lord Warringdale, the murderer, who there met with his deserts, had been a personage much more illustrious by courtesy.\" \" And are you of the same opinion. Bridge water.\" \" I am not very weatherwise, your Highness, but I am iucUneil to that opinion.\" \" Then, gentlemen, if it should ever happen tbat I am King, we will talk over these matters again, and I shall be very happy to receive the Earl of Whitcombe at any time.\" This was quite a sufficient royal acknowledg ment of the validity of Heron's claims to the titles and estates of his ancestors. Colonel Trelawney nodded. \" I comprehend you, Ormond,\" he said : \" you would imply that the Prince himself is not al - together heedless of the reports which have gone abroad regarding his father's death.\" \" Exactly so ; and you will understand that ihe Prince, of all others, is least likely to know now richly that father deserved any fate that came over him.\" Then tbe Earl of Bridgewater spoke. \" Does your Royal Highness think I had better travel ?\" \" True, true ; he has been brought up in strict seclusion.\" \"I should not travel,\" said tho Prince, \"if I were so lucky as to slay in fair fight the murderer of my father ; but if you would like a journey, the Princess Ernestine, my cousin, is at the Court of Hanover. Go and ask her how she is, with my compliments; but don't go unless you feel inclined.\" \" Exactly so, and although neglected by Prince .Frederick of Wales, his father, it is said that \u25a0when they did meet he was always treated with iiavish generosity, and, at all events, an external allow of affection.\" \"I begin to understand,\" said the Earl of Kridgewater, \" why it is that I shall secure, then, toe sympathies of Prince George.\" \" But can it be true,\" said Heron, \" that this antagonism between the King and his son Frederick, Prince of Wales, assumed so deadly a shape?\" \" I will not.\" \" Or unless necessity prompts you; and if it does, I do not think any one wfll be bold enough to stop, on any pretence whatever, a special mes senger from the heir to the throne of England.\" The four gentlemen bowed ; for they felt that their mission to Kew was perfectly accomplished, and, tbat let what would happen, they had tho voice of Prince George with them, with the cer tainty that sooner or later he must sit on tho throne. \" It is strictly true ; but it is a subject upon which we should not further converse. I am happily at leisure, and advise that we immediately proceed to the Palace at Kew.\" \" Would you tell all ?\" asked Bridgewater. \"Certainly, I would conceal nothing; for there fe a moral and physical certainty that the young Prince will sit upon the throne of England before many weeks have passed away.\" Heron would gladly have ridden to Kew on Daisy, but there was no time to send to Castle \u00abeau House. Then that voice would be effective enough for all possible puriKises. The Prince then lifted a letter from the table, and said, in a tone of cheerful curiosity, \"I havo here a note from Lord MandevUle, who tells me tbat justice is at length likely to overtake that notorious l-ascal, Jonathan Wild.\""], [381, "EDITH HERON. 375 \" He is certainly arrested,\" said Heron, '\" since I was an eyc-witncss of the fact.\" \" Mandevflle says he must certainly be hanged.\" \" I am sorry for it, your Royal Highness.\"\" \" Sorry ? sorry ? Eh ? Sorry for such a man as that?\" Jonathan Wild stood in the vestibule vi New- gate. He glared about him ferociously. Every face that looked upon him he knew so w<sll. The warders \u2014 the turnkeys \u2014 even the hang man himseU was there to take a look at the great thief -taker in the hour of iris misfortune. \" Yes, your Royal Highness ; son-y because I do not like any man to be hanged under false pre tences.\" There was little pity rauny of those faces. There was no hope whatever. The general impression was strong and pre valent that Jonathan Wild's days were num bered. \" Indeed ! False pretences ?\" \" Yes, your Royal Highness ; Jonathan Wild is as bad as he can possibly be, and has, in all probabiUty, committed a hundred crimes for which he may deserve the gallows ; but I should like to seo him banged for some one of themrand not because \" It was not that they thought him one whit more criminal than he had always been. Nor was it that tbey viewed that criminality with any peculiarly distasteful eyes or strong sense of its iniquity. But they believed that such a maq as Jona than Wild was tolerably sure to be hanged at last, and they hadjgsod reasons to suppose that the time had come. Heron paused. \" Not because what ? Not because what, my Lord Whitcombe ?\" \" Perhaps I am going too far, and ought not to utter the words which were upon my lips.\" \" Yes, yes, say them \u2014 say them. You may say what you like here.\" \" Then I was going to say, your Highness, that, although Jonathan Wild deserved hanging, he ought not to be hanged merely because my Lord Mandevflle, the Secretary of State, had no further occasion for his services.\" \" Do you hear, aU of you ?\" shouted Wild. \" I teU you it won't be, and it can't be! They may pretend to prosecute me ; but I am too use ful. And besides, there's another reason.\" \" What may that be, Mr. Wild-T' said the head turnkey, Stepping forward. \" You'd like to know, wouldn't you ?\" \" If It's aU the same to you, Mr. Wild, I should.\"' \" Oh,\" said the Prince, \" that's it, is it ? Good day ! good day ! See you all again \u2014 all again, some fine day. Good day ! good day !\" Tho Prince bustled out of the room. \" Then I will tell you. I know too much, and I might open my mouth too wide, and let some of it out. Ha ! -ha ! hat\" Tho four gentlemen looked at each other with smiles. This was a strange idea of Jonathan Wild's. Strange, because he was generally so acute, and had a rough and ready mode of coming at the motives -of actions, particularly when those motives were lying near the surface. He thought, because he knew so much, that the Government would -not venture upon his execution- \" So far so good,\" said Colonel Trelawney. \" Bridgewater, you need be under no trouble whatever as regards the death of my Lord War ringdale.\" \" And I,\" said FeUx Heron, \" amid all the clouds that have obscured my fortunes for so long, begin to 6ee a steady light breaking, which may lead me on to happiness and peace.\" The party left Kew, and mounting their horses, again made the best of their way to London. There could not have been a more fatal mis take. It was just on account <>f tbat very knowledge that he stood in such imminent danger ; and Jona than Wild, like every one else similarly situated, had to learn the fact that the baser tools Of men in power are ahvays sacrificed so soon as tbey know so much as to be-dangerouB on account of that very knowledge. They aUghted once more at Warwick House, where Heron was compelled to stay for a short time, that ho might not cast a slur upon the hospitality of the young Marquis of Ormond. He then made his way on foot to Castleneau House, for he was exceedingly anxious to im part to Lady Castlenau, and to Edith, the stir ring and remarkable events of that day. We are already aware of how fortunate was the arrival of Felix Heron at the peculiar con junction of affairs at Castleneau House, whioh made his presence so intensely to be desired. \" What are you aU staring at ?\" cried Wild again. \" Did you mover see a man in trouble before?\" \" Often, Mr. Wild\u2014 often!\" \" Then don't be making a show of me, as if you didn't know roe.\" \" WeU, Mr. Wild, don't be in a pission ; and if your .time has come \" Wild uttered a yell of rage. \" My time come ! \" he shouted. .\" No ; all your times will come first ; and I hope to see every one of you dangling at the end of the rope before a noose is knotted that will, fit my neck. It's aU a sham, I -tell you.\" \" Very good, Mr. Wild,\" said the clerk of the prison. CHAPTER CCCVIII. JONATHAN WD_D IS AN C-IATE OF NEWGATE. \" They can't hang me ! They shan't hang me ! They dare not do it ! You may all took at me as you please, and no doubt you -think tho last days of Jonathan Wild have come; but they have not ; it's tho spring time of the and come what como may, I can't bang tiU autumn.\" \"Oh, you're there, are you, idiot!\" shouted Jonathan ; \"and you think it very good, do you ? I wfll tell you. all mow what will be very good; and that is for every man Jack of you to be civil"], [382, "EDITH HERON. 376 and obliging, for the time wfll come wWn I shall havo more power than ever, and then look out for squalls.\" The turnkeys and warders pf Newgate were quite abashed at this effrontery of Jonathan Wild's. With she great majority of minds, it is only necessary to assert something in a bold, confident, impudent manner to have it implicitly beUeved ; and whether this self-confidence of Jonathan's was real or assumed, it certainly had aU its effect upon the men who surrounded him. \" I suppose, Mr. Wild,\" said the head turnkey, \" you have a great deal of respect for the old customs of Newgate ?\" \" What do you mean?\" The turnkey held out Ms open hand. \" Garnish,\" he said. Wild laufehed. \" Oh, yes, I understand that perfectly well, and I intend to distribute a hundred pounds among you.\" \" A hundred, Mr. Wild ?\" \" Yes, a hundred. It is fit that I, of all men, should be liberal in the old Stone Jug.\" \" You are very good, Mr. Wild.\" \" Of course I am. A hundred pounds, recollect, among you. It wiU be a nice Uttle sum a-piece.\" Wild had been released from his handcuffs, and now he plunged his hand deep into one of his pockets, as though to get out the hundred pounds which were for distribution among the ten or twelve warders and turnkeys that surrounded him. Then one of the turnkeys caUed out in a loud voice, \" Make way for ids honour the Governor \u2014 make way ! make way I\" The Governor made his appearance, and looked with some curiosity on Jonathan Wild, who had exercised a sway in the prison of Newgate almost equal to his own. \" We'll, Mr. Wild,\" he said, \" things have come to a bad pass with you.\" \" Not at afl,\" said Jonathan. \" I intend, after this Uttle brush is over, to take a steady, respect able situation.\" \" And what may that be, Mr. Wild 7\" \" Governor of Newgate.\" \" Confound your insolence !\" There was a trampUng of horses' feet and a rattling of wheels in the Old Bailey. \" The Sheriff !\" cried the man on the lock. The little wicket at the top of that narrow flight of stone steps, up and down which so many unfortunates had proceeded with lagging feet, was Hung wide open. The Sheriff made his appearance with his chain of office round his neck, and looking unusuaUy grave and solemn. He had a long, official-looking letter in his hand, with a broad seal upon it. For a single moment there came a sallow flush over the face of Jonathan Wild, for he thought it might possibly be his release from the Secretary of State's office. The letter had evidently been opened, and the Sheriff was glancing at it now and then as he came into the vestibule of Newgate, as if it were the special cause of his visit. The most important personage, as we have before had occasion to hint, that can cross the threshold of Newgate is the Sheriff for the time being. The Governor always treats him with marked respeet Even the prison clerk put on an amiable look, and uttered something about Mr. Wild always being a gentleman when he liked. \"Yes,\" added Jonathan, \"a hundred pounds among you ; and let me see, it shall be payable \u2014 yes, payable on the day I walk out of Newgate a free man.\" A sort of groan came from the warders and turnkeys. \" He always was the greatest blackguard in life,\" said the prison clerk. \" And so,\" added Wild, \" you will aU of you be interested in that charming result \u2014 I mean, my liberation. How delighted you all look !\" \" But, Mr. Wild,\" said the head turnkey, \" if things should go wrong, what are we to do then ?\" The words that fall from his Ups are listened to as though they wero the words of an oracle. \" Mr. Governor, you have one Jonathan Wild in custody,\" said the Sheriff. \" Yes, sir ; here is the man.\" \" Oh ! very good ! Then I may as well read you a paragraph in this letter, which I have re ceived this morning from the Right Hon. the Secretary of State.\" \"Ah!\" cried Wild. \"Ah, to be sure, that's true!\" \"You know we can't help it if you are hanged.\" \" Silence!\" said tho Governor The Sheriff gave a slight cougn, and then he read. \" True again \u2014 true again ! Well, then, if it tbould happen that things go wrong \" \u2022' Yes, Mr. WUd.\" \" 'And more especially I call upon you, in your official capacity as Sheriff, and, conse quently, responsible keeper of His Majesty's gaol of Newgate, to be heedful of the safe custody of its prisoners, several of whom, to the great scandal of the administration of the law, have recently escaped.' \" The Sheriff looked at the Governor at this juncture, as though he would have him mark these words well. \" IS my enemies should get the better of me, and I should really take a ride to Tyburn \" \" Yes, Mr. Wild ?\" \" I wiH leave you all \" \"What?\" \" My blessing.\" The turnkeys fell back. They muttered maledictions loud and deep upon the head of the great thief-taker. The prison clerk walked away thoroughly dis gusted. Then he raised his voice a little, and read on. \" ' I would, therefore, suggest to you, that when a criminal of no ordinary magnitude is in your hands, that you would take the most strin gent means for his safe custody ; and you will understand me when I give you, as an example, tbe name of Jonathan Wild.' \" Wild laughed loudly, with a fiendish kind of roar, that echoed through the vestibule of the prison."], [383, "377 EDITH HERON. The Sheriff ceased reading. He slowly folded up the letter, and looked at ceiving stolen goods,\" added Wild, \"aU this session.\" \" Are you coming, Martin ?\" There was a tremendous noise, as if some the Governor. Wild glanced from one to the other of them, like some caged animal, who felt that his chances of escape from his captors were becoming each moment more slender. \" I comprehend,\" said tho Governor. u Grif fiths\u2014Mr. Griffiths!\" great mass of iron had faUen down immediately adjoining the vestibule of Newgate. Then a man of herculean form and strength made his appearance, carrying over Us shoulder a huge forge-hammer, while, under his other arm, he brought a small portable anvil, consisting _i an upright block of oak, iron-bound, and heavily capped with the same metal. With a grating, discordant noiae across the stone flooring of tho VG3iibulo of Nowgate, a turn key dragged in a o_xa\u00a3i_io heavy set of fetters. Those iron manacles of an age past, specimens of which may stfll be seen by the curious in such affairs if they would only now proceed to thc Old Bailey, aad glance upwards at the 6toae doorways of Newgate- \" Yes, sir.\" \" Send for Martin.\" \" Yes, sir.\" , \" And get your heaviest set of irons n':.k!J. A roar bmst from Wild. \" Sinco when,\" ho cried, \" is a nan like me, taken up for potty larceny, to bo loaded with the heaviest fetters Newgate can afford ?\" \" It is not petty larceny,\" said the Governor ; \" but capital felony.\" \" There hasn't been a man executed for re- No. 100.\u2014 Edith Heron."], [384, "378 EDITH HERON. Those grim old rusted set of irons that are now to be seen over the narrow entrance porch. may, for all we know, be the very set that on this occasion were dragged lumberiDg into the vesti bule of Newgato for the special use of Jonathan Wild. CHAPTE6 CCCIX. JONATHAN VlLD's INDICTMENT The indictment against Jonathan Wild was of two sorts. The smith set down his anvil. He was first of all accused generally for set ting up, as general profession, the business of re ceiving stolen goods, and that indictment ran in the following form : \u2014 \" That for many years past he had been a confederate with great numbers of highwaymen, pickpockets, housebreakers, shop-lifters, and other thieves. The operation of fettering some notorious malefactors was what Jonathan Wild had often himself seon performed upon others. The shrieking terrors of the poor wretch thus encased in iron had never brought a thrill of pity to the heart of the great thief-taker. But then he had never contemplated wearing those manacles himself. _ \" Now, Mr. Wild, if you pleaso,\" said the smith. \"One foot up here ; whichever you please first ; we give everybody tbeir choice.\" Wild hesitated a moment. \" That he had formed a kind of corporation of thieves, of which he was the head or director, and that notwithstanding his pretended services in detecting and prosecuting offenders, he pro cured such only to be hanged as concealed their booty, or refused to share it with him. \" That he had divided the town and country into so many districts, and appointed distinct gangs for each, who regularly accounted with him for their robberies. That he also had a par ticular set to steal at churches at time of divine service, and also other moving detachments to attend at Court, on birthdays, balls, Ac, and at both Houses of Parliament, circuits, and country fairs. He seemed half incUaed to resist. But then the - hopelessness of doing so with anything Uke effeot must have come instantly across bis mind. He put up his foot. The manacle was clasped round his ankle. A loose rivet was placed into it. Then a piece of iron of rather soft texture, and shaped liko a large flat nail, was thrust in by tbe side of the rivet or bolt. This nail \u2014 if we may so call it \u2014 could only be pushed about half-way into the narrow space left for it. \" That the persons employed by him were f oi the most part felon convicts, who had returned from transportation before the time for which they were transported had expired, and that he made choice of them to be his agents because they could not be legal evidenoes against him, and because he had it in his power to take from them what part of the stolen goods he thought fit and otherwise use them ill, or hang them as he pleased \" That he had from time to time supplied each convicted felon with money and clothes, and lodged them in his own house the better to concoal them ; particularly some against whom there are now informations for counterfeiting and diminish ing broad-pieces aud guineas. \" That he had not only been a receiver of stolen goods, as well as of writings of all kinds for near iiftoon yoars past but had frequently been a con federate, and robbed along with the above-named Thc hammer was to do the rest. \" Steady, Mr. Wild !\" said the smith. Wild shut his eyes. Ho felt the whiff of air pass his face, as the huge forge hammer was raised aud swung round the head of the smith of Newgate. , Bang ! it came on the head of the nail. Tho soft iron was crushed down and flat tened. The manacle was tight. Then Jonathan Wild opened his eyes again. There was an awful look of hate and ven- geance lurking in them. But in five minutes more he was completely fettered. One compassionate turnkey lent him a couple of pocket-handkerchiefs, with which the loose portion of the fetters could be tied up in a manner so as to be the least inconvenient to wear. convicted felons. \" That in order to carry on these vile practices, and to gain some credit from the ignorant multi tude, he usually carried a short silver staff as a badge of authority from the Government which he used to produce when he himself was con scerned in robbing. Then Wild drew himself up, and, in spite of tbe inconvenience of the action, folded his arms across his chest The iron bars and links about him rattled as he did so. \" That he had under his care and direction several warehouses for receiving and conceaUng stolen goods ; and also a ship for carrying off jewels, watches, and other valuable goods to Holland, where he had a superannuated thief for his factor. \" Listen to me, all of you,\" he said. \" I don't beUeve I shaU be hunted to death this time ; but if I am, aud it is then possible for any ghost to make Newgate a horror that none of you can abide in from sunset to cock-crow, mine shall be that ghost You shall meet me in the long, gloomy passages at night ; you shall encounter me in the cells ; I will dart out upon you from the corridors, and as you ascend the staircases, you will hear mo rushing after you, and feel my skeleton fingers clutching at your skirts. Ha! ha!\" \" That he kept in pay several artists, to make alterations and transform watches, seals, snuff boxes, rings, and other valuable things, that they might not be known, several of which he used to present to such persons as he thought might be of sen ace to him. \"That he seldom ornever helped the owners to the notes and papers thoy had lost, unless he found them able exactly to specify and describe"], [385, "379 EDITH HERON. them, and then often insisted on having more than half their value. have the full benefit of the laws under which he lives. \" And lastly, it appeared that he had often sold human blood, by procuring false evidence to swear persons into facts of which they were not guilty. Sometimes to prevent them from being evidences against himself; and at other times, for the sake of the great rewards given by the Government\" \" It is not that we think him a bad man, or that we believe him to have been guUty of this or that offence against justice and moraUfy that we must judge him. \" No, gentlemen of the jury, we must allege some specific charge, and that must be sup ported by the clearest and most substantial evi dence. It was quite clear that an indictment of this description, however much it might prejudice a man in Jonathan WUd's position, was of by far too general a character to be convicted upon. We must not weary the reader with the fuU details of Jonathan Wild's various appearances at the court of the Old Bailey ; but we proceed at once to that important day when he was fairly put upon his trial, with an intention on the part of the prosecution to strive every nerve to bring him in guilty. It was the middle of the month of May A, bright and beautiful season, for at that time winter and summer seemed more decided in their aspects, and to come and go with more decided hues of demarcation, than they do at present. The protracted prosecution of Jonathan Wild had made it not only the town's talk, but had awakened a strong interest throughout the whole of the United Kingdom. And if the vanity of the great thief-taker at that moment could have overcome his sense of great and paramount danger, he might well have looked about him with pride and satisfaction to see the dense crowd of faces about him in the court of tho Old Bailey. \" Upon that evidence the prosecution must stand or fall; and in relation to that evidence the prisoner at the bar stands before you, in no greater peril being what he is, than as though he were the best and purest of human beings.\" The counsel suddenly sat down. He had said all he wished. It was left to a junior counsel to state the facts of the case as against Wild, and to call the wit nesses. \" My lord, and gentlemen of the jury,\" said the junior counsel, raising almost his superior had sat down ; \" the case against the prisoner is just this. \"There resides in Holbom a Mrs. Catherine Stretham, a lace mercer, who finds it necessary, in the course of her business, to keep a stock of exceedingly expensive Foreign and English laces. \" On the evening of the twenty-second of January last past, Mrs. Stretham was in her shop alone \u2014 having sent her assistant out on some business of importance. \" Two persons came into the shop \u2014 a man and a woman, and engaged her attention for a con siderable time in looking at laces, which, how ever, appeared not to please them ; and they left without making any purchase. \" At the door of Mrs. Stretham's shop they met her assistant, who was returning from her errand ; and who, consequently, forms an addi tional witness to their identity. \" Within five minutes of the departure of these persons, Mis. Stretham missed a tin box, con taining eleven pieces of valuable lace, coming, collectively, to the sum of fifty pounds. \" No trace could be found of the thieves for a considerable time, until they were accidentally seen in the street by Mrs. Stretham's assistant, who immediately raised an outcry, and gave them into custody. The male prisoner's name was Henry KeUy, and the woman's Margaret Murphy. Finding that they were distinctly sworn to before the magistrate, both by Mrs. Stretham and her assistant, they confessed their crime, at the 6ame time stating that they were incited to its commission by the prisoner at the bar. Under these circumstances his Majesty's Go vernment considered it would be desirable for the ends of justice to permit these two persons, Henry KeUy and Margaret Murphy, to become King's evidence. \"My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, they wfll appear before you this day to depose to these facts as against the prisoner at the bar, who you wfll perceive is indicted as an accompUce in the stealing.\" Tbe counsel who had been employed, and most enormously feed by Jonathan WUd to defend him, was an elderly man. Many persons of rank and note had seats upon the bench. It was surmised that every barrister in London made at least an attempt to get into the court on that occasion. The heavy irons had been struok off from the limbs of Jonathan Wild previous to his being placed in the dock. He was rather pale, but he had dressed him self with great care. No costume, however, or colour, could do more than transiently hide the brutal ferocity of his appearance. Previous to the judge taking his scat upon the Bench, and tbe trial fairly commencing, Wild in dustriously distributed hand-bills from the dock. These bills contained a long \u2014 real or pretended \u2014 list of malefactors whom he had brought to justice. The list might have been essentially true, but Jonathan Wild forgot to add, that almost in every case these malefactors had only been brought to justice because they either refused, or were no longer capable of being useful to him, in the ne farious business he carried on. It was a quarter-past ten o'clock when this im portant trial commenced. One of the most eminent counsel of the day was engaged to prosecute; and Wild listened with a darkening visage to the trenchant terms in which his guilt was depicted. \" My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, \" It becomes necessary, even wheo a criminal of so deep a dye as the man who now stands before you is brought to justice, that he should"], [386, "380 EDfTH HERON. No one was better versed than he in what was called \" Old Bailey law.\" He rose now and addressed the judge. \"J hope, my lord, we clearly understand what is aUeged against the prisoner!\" \" I hope so, too,\" said the Judge. \" Perhaps, your lordship wfll have no objection to state it.\" \"The prisoner,\" said the Judge, \"is indicted for stealing, in complicity with Henry KeUy. and Margaret Murphy, eleven pieces of lace, the pro perty of Catherine Stretham, and of the value of fifty pounds.\" \"Wfll your lordship kindly state where the alleged felony is said to have taken place ?\" The slightest shadow of a smile crossed the Judge's face as he replied, \"In the dwelling house of the said Catherine Stretham.\" \" Go on.\" \" Well, we went and did the job, and Johnny Wild he gave us ten spangles, and after that a young woman 'dentified us on Snow Hill, and we were both grabbed, and here I is !\" \" That will do.\" KeUy evidently thought that his examination was over, and was about to descend from the witness-box, but the counsel for Jonathan Wild rose, and said, in a calm, cool voice, \" Not so fast, Henry Kelly, if you please ! I have a few words to say to you !\" \" Wery good, sir.\" \" Were you ever convicted ?\" \"Sir?\" \" Were you ever convicted of any offence against the law ?\" \" I've been took up on suspicion V \" And found guUty !\" \" WeU, they was all dead set agin me, so they did say as I was guilty ; and what was a poor chap to do aU alone, with no end of people swearing agin him ?\" \" How often has that happened ?\" \" I always was bad at recollecting I\" \" Have you been convicted twenty times ?\" \" I should say not.\" \" Recollect you are on your oath, and that re cords are kept in this court. Now, wfll you swear that you have not been convicted fifteen times ?\" \" Very good, my lord.\" Wild's counsel sat down as if there was no- thing at all the matter. \"CaU Henry Kelly !\" cried the usher of the court. A low-browed looking ruffian, who was per fectly well known to Jonathan Wild, since he had been one of his own men for a considerable period, was brought into court in custody and ushered into the witness-box. Tho oath was immediately administered to him, and then the senior counsel for the prose cution rose to examine him. \" Your name ?\" \" Can't recollect.\" \" Henry Kelly.\" \"Anything else?\" \" Well, the famUy calls me the Artful Grab ber.\" \" But you won't swear to the contrary ?\" \"WeU, I won't.\" \" How many times have you been convicted of perjury ?\" \"Why, only twice. You knows that well enough !\" \" A capital witness !\" said Wild's counsel. \" I quite congratulate the prosecutor upon this just specimen of King's evidence they have had tho temerity to bring before you, my lord, and you, gentlemen of the jury.\" \" Anything else, sir ?\" said KeUy. \" No, you may go down, and a greater ruffian, I may say, I never saw !\" \" The same to you, sir, and many of 'em !\" \" Take that man out of court!\" said the Judge. \" Look at the prisoner at the bar.\" \" I sees him.\" \" And you know him ?\" \"Rather. Why everybody knows Johnny Wild.\" \"You will please, then, to relate to the court what took place in relation to the robbery at Mrs. Stretham's, the lace merchant on Holborn- HiU, on the twenty-second of January last past.\" \" I was at Jonathan Wild's house, and as he came by me he gave my skirt pocket a bit of a shake, and he says, ' Why, Kelly,' says he, ' there's nothing to jingle hero. What do you say to a bit of business that'll bring in a few odd guineas ?' So I says ' I'm your man, Mr. Wild.' \" The officers hustled the witness away, and in the countenance of Jonathan Wild there sat a covert smile. He began to breathe more freely. The certainty of his escape, at all events from the consequences of this indictment, began to put him into better spirits. The atrocious character of the witness almost made Jonathan Wild look not so bad as he really was. \" Stop a bit!\" said the Judge ; \" not so fast, if you please 1\" The Judge finished his notes, and then, look ing up, he added, \" Now, go on !\" Tho villainous witness proceeded. \" ' All's right,' says Mr. Wild ; ' but it'll want two of you, and the other ought to be a woman.' ' I knows of one,' says I. ' Very good,' says he. ' Then do you know Mrs. Stretham's warehouse on Holborn HiU ?' * I does,' says I.\" \" Step !\" said the Judge again. In a few seconds more, the witness was allowed to proceed. Wild was a clever tactitian. He thought, now, that if he could raise a laugh, it would be in his favour. He had observed that when juries laughod they seldom convicted. Suddenly, Us ting off his wig, he clapped it on the head of one of the warders of Newgate, who was close to him, and then, With an immense silk handkerchief, gave his bald head, with its nu merous cuts and contusions, a general scrub. The effect was ludicrous. There was a general laugh in Court WUd had effected his object. \" ' Then,' says Mr. Wild, ' you and the woman you knows of go in there at the dusk of the evening and grab some lace. I'll wait here at home for you and give you the best price going for tbe swag !'\""], [387, "381 EDITH HERON. He had amused the jury, and was accordingly high quarters, that his janissaries were faithful to him, but now that he was, as it were, displaced from his high position, the great thief-taker could not but be aware that there was scarcely one of them who would have held forth a helping hand to save him even from death. hopeful. CHAPTER CCCX. Vie say, then, that Jonathan Wild looked gratified as the man gave him this proof of his fidelity, and, stretching forth his hand, he said, \" Thanks, Bradshaw, I see you are at least faithful. I have really no fears for myself, but still it wfll be as well to provide against all con tingencies.\" \" I should say so, too, Mr. Wild, for from what I can gather outside the stone jug, matters will go hard with you.\" \" I teU you, no such thing,\" roared Wild. \" What have I done now, more than I have done for the last fifteen years of my life ?\" JONATHAN WILD FINDS THAT HE HAS A FRIEND IN NEED. While these preUminary proceedings were going on at the Court, there was another scene en acting, which it was hoped by Jonathan Wild would go far towards liberating him from his present dilemma. It is necessary that the reader should be made aware that two hours before the commencement of the trial of Jonathan Wild, a man had pre sented himseU at the door of Newgate, with a request to see the prisoner. The visitor was dressed in a sober suit of black, with a whita^cravat, and when the man who was \" on the lock\" beheld a respectable looking, even gentlemanly man, demanding ad mittance, he asked more civily than was his wont, \" Who did you please to want, sir?\" \" One Jonathan Wild,\" replied the visitor, in calm, solemn accents ; \" it is necessary that I should see him, for in good truth I apprehend he has not long to live. His many crimes- \" \" Oh, you are not a friend of his, then,\" said the turnkey with a jerk of his thumb, which the visitor took for granted indicated that portion of the building in which Jonathan Wild was con fined. \" It is just that, Mr. Wild,\" replied Bradshaw, \" it is just that \u2014 it is an offence of long-standing.\" \" Bah ! you are a fool, Bradshaw ; and if you only came here to try and make matters look worse than they do already, why you had better take yourself off again.\" \" As you please, Mr. WUd,\" returned tbe man ; \"only I thought it would be ju6t as well not to feel quite so confident, and then, most likely, you would take better steps to extricate yourself from your present trouble.\" \" That's just what I am going to do, idiot that you are ! only you interrupt me at every turn by some drivelling argument or other. I teU you you can help me materiaUy, if you wiU.\" \" That I am wflling to do so is sufficiently proved, I should think, by my being here, Mr. Wild.\" \" Not in the sense that you mean, my man ; but I am a friend to the friendless and unfortu nate, and I would fain make this one see the orror of his ways.\" \" Well, he is a bad 'un, and no mistake,\" re joined the turnkey ; \" and if so be as you can make an impression upon his heart, why, I for one, will call you a clever fellow.\" \" Peace, my good man. I have no time to lose, my flock require almost my hourly atten tion, therefore, admit me at once to this lost sinner's cell.\" \" WeU, well, I was to blame, perhaps ; but it enrages me to hear you talk as though every thing were arranged, and I was actually cast for death. No, no ! That can't be ! I won't believe it!\" The warder at this moment rapped at the cell door. \" Time's almost up, sir.\" \"Five minutes more,\" said Bradshaw, in the voice he had assumed in conversing with tbe warders and turnkeys of the prison. Then, turning quickly to Wild, he said, \" Quick, Mr. Wild \u2014 tell me how I may serve you.\" \"You must know, then,\" said Wild, \"that one clause in the indictment against me is that I have never returned stolen property to its right ful owners without exacting more than half its value.\" \" Yes, sir.\" The turnkey turned the key in tho lock, and admitted the vistor. He led him to a door, where he called to a warder, saying, \" Admit this gentleman to Jonathan Wild's cell, Peters ; it's all right.\" The visitor followed his guide, until they stopped before a low arched door, the present abode of the great thief-taker. \" Here's a visitor, Mr. Wild,\" said the man, as he flung open the cell door; \"and much go_i may he do you.\" Jonathan Wild spoke not until the door w.is closed, and then he raised his eyes to the visitor's face. \" Yes, yes,\" said the man, glancing uneasily at the door. \" Then you must go to Mrs. Ripon, who keeps a fence.\" \"Yes; I know 'them well. She married a hypocritical vagabond, who goes by the name of Mortification Ripon now.\" \" The same. Go there, and tell them tbat, to save my lfle, and make me their friend, they must both be prepared to swear that they know of several instances where I have returned stolen property without demanding a single farthing.\" \" Enough ; I understand. Is there any one else more influential than these people, who are known to be no good themselves, to whom I can go.\" \" You, Bradshaw ?\" he exclaimed. \" Yes, Mr. Wild. I always said, that if ever vou did get into a scrape of this kind, Jem Brad shaw would not desert you, and here I am. What's to be done ; teU me, and 111 do it\" A look of gratification passed over the face of Jonathan Wild, as he listened to these words. Ho had good reason to know that it was only be cause he possessed so large a share of interest in"], [388, "382 IsJOTEl HEK, _C Jonatliaa Wild looked down upon the floor of the ceil, _sj.nl seemed lost in thought \"'i\u0153,\" he muttered to himself; \"snrelyshe will aid me. I have done more than this for her.\" f Lorv bless me!\" shrieked Mrs. Ripon. \" Talk of -he Well, never mind! We were not sajfiag anything against Mr. Wild.\" Bang ! bang ! came again at the outer door. * Go and let him in,\" said Mrs. Ripon. \" It is Mr. Wild, I've no doubt ; and he can have a cud oi taa.\" \"What did you say. We. \"Wild?\" asked Erad shaw. \u25a0 \" Noihi.g ; a habit I have contracted of thinking aloud.\" \" Time is up,\" suggested Bradshaw. \" Is there any one else I can go to ?\" \"Yes. Go to Castleneau House ; ask to see Lady Castleneau, and see if you can induce her to intercede for me. If she wfll, she can save me at z_y utmost peril.\" \" Now, sir,\" shouted the turnkey, \" time's up.\" \" I thank you, my friend,\" said Bradshaw, as- suming his solemn voice again ; \" I wfll leave my charge now, and will return again to-morrow to see if what I have said has been the means of melting his obdurate heart.\" \" Heart !\" said the turnkey, laughing hoarsely ; '\u2022 heart? I think it is a lang time since he was troubled with such ap iucumbrance. The idea of Jonathan Wild's heart \u2014 it's positively amus- ing.\" \"My friend, be more charitable^ try to think well of your feUow-creatures, and seek not to add to the sorrows of one who is already so crushed down by misfortune.\" '\u2022 Then I suppose he's not swearing and tear- ing about his ceU now like a wild beast in his den, as he was a Uttle while ago.\" \" He is penitent, I trust\" *\u25a0_ Humph t It msy be so, for all I know,\" said tho turnkey \" Only he iiCLa'i tstum so very penitent awhile ago, I when he said he should like to see me and everybody else , hanged, and that as soon as he got free he would use his influence to procure himself that Uttle gratification.\" \" i'ou should not. take any notice of what a fellow-creature says when he is cast down, as Mr. Wild i6 just now, but you should pray.\" \" Oh, bother ! I leave that to better people than Joseph Jebb; so, good day to you, Mr. parson\u2014 for, I take it, you aro of that kidney \u2014 and joy be with you.\" Bradshaw was passed on from what may be called beat to beat of the warders, and soon had I the satisfaction of hearing the wi^ket-gate of Newgate closed upon him. He walked at a rapid pace through by-streets, looking neither to the right nor to the left until he reached Wardour Street, where dwelt Morti fication and Mrs. Ripon. The latter was just indulging in a cup of extra strong tea with Mortification ; and this couple, who were usually anything but agreeable com pany for each other, on this day appeared to be on the best possible terms. Mortification wont to reconnoitre in the shop, an ;. as his custom when any visitors demand'ed admission to that respectable-looking Uttle is wel licff. He came back in a minute to tbe parlour, is,vA wh:,jpered, \" I don't know him ; he's not one ____ oni customers. Perhaps, it is ono of the nabs in disguise.\" Mrs. Ripon uttered a half-shriek, as she grasped s paper parcel which lay on thc table by her side. Bang! bang! bang! came again tho blows on th*. outer door. \" Open the door, now, Mortification,\" whis pered Mrs. Ripon, after having hidden the brown paper parcel behind a cushion on an old easy chair which stood by the fireside. Mortification went to the outer door and threw it t'pen. \" Sorry to keep you waiting so long, sir, but I was in the back part of the premises with my wife, and we did not hear you knock tho shot time.\" \" How did you know, then, that I had knocked more than once ?\" asked Bradshaw ; \" but, pshaw ! dont keep me parleying here. Let me come in ; I hive something particular to say to you and to Mrs. Ripon.\" \" Certainly, sir, certainly !\" said Mortification, ap :ie ushered the visitor into the parlour at the bii ik of the shop. Mrs. Ripon glanced at Mm, and it was ori dont that she did not recognise her self-biddou guest \"Jonathan Wild is going to be hung!\" he said, without losing another moment \u2022' Lor's a mercy '.\" screamed Mrs. Ripon. \" what a good thing !\" \"Oh, you think so, do you ?\" asked Bradshaw, sternly. \"No\u2014 no.

Brad shaw bent his step3 towards Castleneau House. Old Anthony repUed to his summons for ad mission, and in answer to his question as to whether Lady Castleneau were visible, said he would go and see, in the meantime conducting the visitor to a small room on the ground floor. \" Your name, sir,\" asked Anthony. \" Mr. Makepeace !\" replied Bradshaw. Old Anthony withdrew. \"Makepeace? Makepeace? I do not know tne name, but nevertheless I will see him.\" \"Very good, my lady,\" as he preceded his be loved mistress down the grand staircase of the mansion. \" This way, your ladyship,\" he added, as he threw the door open, and stationed himself outside, to be in readiness should his services be required. Certainly Mr. Kelly had not come scatheless out of the cross-examination to which he had been subjected. But still the prosecution had something to say to Jonathan Wild. The jocular look he had put on faded as the junior counsel again rose. \" Call Margaret Murphy.\" The name echoed through the corridors and avenues of the court Wild looked a little anxious. He of aU men knew weU the effect of corro borated evidence on the minds of a jury. Margaret Murphy might not be able to deposo to one fact more than had been sworn to by Henry Kelly ; but she would no doubt substan tiate what he had said. An ordinary-looking young woman stepped into the witness box. Lady Castleneau advanced into the room with that dignified step which characterized the aged gentlewoman, and said, \" I have not the honour of knowing Mr. Makepeace, but if I can be of service in any way \" \"You can, my lady,\" interrupted Bradshaw. \" You can, perhaps, be the means of saving a human life.\" Wild knew her well. But she would not look at him, although it was quite evident he strove to catch her eye She was duly sworn Very few questions were asked, because, after all, the case lay in a nut shell, and all she could do was to corroborate Henry Kelly. Wild's counsel paid no attention to her whatever, feeUng no doubt in his discretion and practice, that the sooner she mus gone and her examination over, the better. \" Me ? How ? What mean you ?\" \" Of saving the life of one,\" continued Brad shaw, who has befriended those dear to you more than once.\" \"Of whom speak you?\" asked Lady Castle neau. Then a more important witness stepped for ward, viz., Mrs. Catherine Stretham, tho owner of the lace. \" Of Jonathan Wild.\" Lady Castleneau held up her hand. \" No,\" she cried ; \" I cannot do it Ask nje not. True, he has saved the life of one very - dear me ; but I cannot forget, also, that he has likewise been the bane of that dear one's Use ; that he persecuted tho husband ef that dear one, and would have taken his life more than once.\" She was a quiet, rather lady-like person, and appeared in a state of great trepidation, at being dragged up as evidence in a court of justice at all. The senior counsel examined her. \" Now, Mrs. Stretham, you wfll be so good as to relate to the court how and under what cir cumstances you lost a box of lace on the twenty second of January last past.\" \" I was alone in my shop when a man and woman came in.\" \u00ab But Usten \" Lady Castleneau waved her hand for silence. \" I can only promise to do nothing that may in Miy way make his present prospects worse than they are ! but I cannot \u2014 dare not interfere with the course of justice.\" Lady Castleneau bowed gently, and turned to leave the room. \"Should you know that man and woman again ?\" \" Most certainly.\" \"Then,\" said the counsel, 1 have to apply to your lordship to order that the tv/o witnesses Henry Kelly and Margaret Murphy be brought forward.\" \" Stay yet one moment,\" said Bradshaw, when I tell you that he is penitent, fuU of remorse.\" \"No more, no more,\" said Lady Castleneau. \" If he be penitent, he may yet be happy ; if not in this world, at least t here.\" Lady Castleneau pointed upwards, and with a sorrowful look upon her face, left the apart ment \" Let it be so,\" said the judge. The two King's evidences were placed side by side, and although they knew that they were perfectly safe, long habit made them exceedingly chary of being recognised. And Henry KeUy iu particular made the most hideous grimaces, such as he was accustomed to do on the former occasions when he was brought up at the bar of justice, and wished to puzzle witnesses as to his identity. CHAPTER CCCSL Margaret Murphy looked perfectly stoUd, and put on that air of vacant stupidity which persons of her class frequently assume, when they are in an objective mood, and wiU not understand any thing that is said or done. \"Now, Mrs. Stretham,\" said the Counsel, \" look at these two persons.\" THE TRIAL OF JONATl_<_N WILD CONTINUED. We resume the trial of Jonathan Wild Up to the point at which we left off our ac count of that remarkable judicial investigation, the proceedings seemed rather in favour, than otherwise, of Jonathan Wild. The characters of the witnesses for the crown were of that nature materiaUy to damage their \" I do, sir.\" \" Do you recognise them ?\" \"Oh, yes.\" ,-viilecce."], [390, "384 EDITH HERON. \" On what occasion have you seen them?\" \" They are the man and woman who came into my shop and stole the lace-\" \" That you swear to?\" \" Oh, yes ; most certainly.\" \" Now teU us what happened after that?\" \"Having heard that Mr. Jonathan Wild was the most likely person in London to hear of my stolen lace, I \" \u2022 Wild's counsel was on his feet in a moment. It was upon that second count that the great battle was likely to take place, for there WUd had his answer, and the whole matter was sure to I\"* a conflict of evidence. That second indictment charged him with an offence actually committed while he was in New gate. There was a clause in an act of ParUament, passed in the reign of George the First,' which made it a capital felony for any person to act as agent or go-between for fee or reward, be tween thieves and persons who had been robbed for the purpose of restoring the stolen property. Surely if any man breathing was inimical to such an indictment, that man was Jonathan WUd. \" Stop !\" he cried, in a voice that rang through the Court. Mrs. Stretham looked terrified. \" We have nothing to do with what you did after that. I call upon his lordship, in the name of Justice, to confine the evidence within the limits of the indictment.\" Such acts had been the business of his life. The Counsel for the prosecution interposed, then, with an air of vexation. He had reduced them to a system. He had thriven upon them. He had grown rich upon them, and the very golden fee that lay snugly in the pocket of his counsel, was a result of the very business that that act of Parliament was levelled at. \" What does my learned friend mean ? Of course there is an indictment and of course we are all here, including his lordship as well as my learned friend, in the interests of truth and justice.\" Affairs looked serious. \" I beg your pardon,\" said Wild's Counsel. \" I am here in the interests of my client, and you may depend upon il I mean to take care of them.\" \" But \" \u00bb The semi-jocular appearance which Wild had put on departed from his face. It was remarked that he put his hand up to his ear, which had becomo a rather frequent ac tion of his of late, and it now arose from bis in tense anxiety, that not a word should escape him of what was about to take place. The senior counsel rose again to speak to this second alarming count in the indict mans? \" My lord and gentlemen of tbe jury. I en tirely agree with the learned judge, that the evi dence we had to offer fell short of proving tho first count in the indictment against the prisoner at the bar, and therefore I rejoice and heartily connive in his acquittal.\" WUd made a hideous grimace \" But !\" added the counsel, \" the second count presents features of quite a different character. \" It is a fact patent to you all, gentlemen, and especiaUy to you, my lord, that if there were no receivers*there would be no thieves. \" There need be no buts, I object to tbe evi dence you are endeavouring to procure from the witness, Catherine Stretham, and I caU upon his lordship to decide the point.\" The judge paused a moment, aud then glanc ing at the counsel for the prosecution, he said, \" May I ask if there are any more witnesses to call for the prosecution ?\" \"No, my lord.\" \" Then I feel bound to say, that the evidence, as at present rendered, does not support the in dictment.\" Wild's counsel at once sat down, and calmly took up the newspaper. The case was ever. Or if he did not think it over, it was his po- Ucy.to pretend as much. The prosecution looked vexed. Or they pretended to look vexed. Which was it? \" It is the faciUties which are daUy and hourly presented for the disposal of stolen property, that makes robbery so easy to accomplish, and so dif ficult to detect. There was an enormous deal of finesse among those lawyers'. The judge then addressed the jury. \" Gentleman,\" he said. \" I shall direct an ac quittal of the prisoner at the bar upon all matters of fact, inference or reason, aud as regards the case brought before you, it is your particular province to decide, but this is a matter of law, and it is quite clear from the evidence adduced by the prosecution, that the prisoner at the bar did not steal the lace which is the subject of the indictment that is to say, as far os we are con cerned, he did not steal it because we have no evidence that he did.\" \" It is a notorious fact to the administrators of justice, that there is a regular organised system in this great city, by which, the moment a rob bery is effected, a series of negociations are set on foot between the receiver of the stolen goods, the thief, and the person who has been despoiled of his property \" I am quite sure that when I state that the prisoner at the bar is the man who, of all others, has brought that system to perfection \u2014 if I may use that expression \u2014 I am saying nothing but what is warranted by the truth. \" I now proceed to state the facts to you, gen tlemen of the jury, which bear upon this second indictment, and which I shall be abie to prove to you on incontestable evidence. \" Mrs. Stretham, of course, upon the loss of her lace, had a two-fold anxiety The jury upon this consulted together for a few moments \u2014 or seemed to consult, and then pronounced a verdict of not guilty. Did Wild rejoice ? Did he believe himself safe ? Certainly not, no one knew better than, he that there was a second count to the indictment, upon which he might be convicted, and the pe nalty of which was likewise death. \" She wanted to recover her property. \" And she wanted to bring the criminals to justice. \" Making inquiries with regard to this two-fold"], [391, "385 EDITH HERON. object, she was informed that the best person ahe could possibly apply to, was Mr. Jonathan Wild, the prisoner at the bar. \" She accordingly repaired to his house, Little Newgate, as it is familiarly called, and there she saw him when he at once entered into the tran saction, promising her the return of her lace upon an adequate reward. \"She offered five guineas, which Jonathan Wild declared to be utterly inadequate to the return of property valued at fifty pounds. \" He then put on an air of unconcern, and told her she had better advertise, and say what she would give if the property were left at her shop, stating at tho same time in the advertisement, that no questions would be asked. \" She did so advertise, but in vain. \" Then Jonathan Wild paid her a visit, at which he told her he had received a mysterious com munication, to the effect, that if she deposited the No. 101\u2014 Edith Heron. sum of twenty pounds upon the doorstep of his house, between the houre of eleven and twelve at night, her lace would be brought to her by eight o'clock on the following morning. This Mrs. Stretham declined. \" Well, my lord and gentlemen of the jury, negociations went on in this manner between the prosecutrix and prisoner until his Majesty's Government thought proper to apprehend him and place him at the bar of this Court. 11 And now I come to a remarkable circum stance, which shows that, to a man hke Jona than Wild, no circumstances would be sufficient to deter him from carrying on his nefarious prac tices. \" My lord and gentlemen of the jury, he ac tually carried out this negociation between the prosecutrix, the thieves, and himself, for the return of the stolen lace, while a prisoner ia Newgate 1"], [392, "386 EDITH HEROK. \"It is for the authorities of that prison to explain how it is that a prisoner, confined there on a charge of felony, could be permitted so much Hberty of action. \" On the tenth of March lass, Mrs. Stretham received a letter, signed by the prisoner at the bar, stating that if she came to him at Newgate, aDd brought ten guineas with her, she should have her lace restored. , \" The object Of this course was to quash the prosecution. yours, to do my best to restore to you your stolen lace. | \" Please call here for further particulars, and ask for \" Yours faithfully, \"Jonathan Wild.\" \" An exceedingly proper letter,\" said Wild's counsel, as if speaking to himself. There was a laugh in court. The rank hypocricy of such an epistle from a man like Jonathan Wild was so great, that it v, almost too much for the gravity of the Judge. \u25a0; What did you do then, Mrs. Stretham ?\" \"Nothing, sir.\" '\u2022 Then, I presume, you had some further com munication ?\" \" We are all thankful that in the interests of justice that object has not been accomplished. \" Well, my lord and gentlemen, the prosecu trix did go to Newgate, and took the ten guineas with her. She saw the prisoner in one of the rooms appropriated to the interviews between prisoners and their attorneys. \" Now what happened at that interview is ex ceedingly important as bearing upon the guilt of the prisoner in respect to the present indictment. \"He held the ten guineas in his hand, and then laid them on a table, after which he wrote a letter, which he told her was addressed to the person who would return ber her lace. \" Placing the ten guineas then on the letter, he handed them both back to Mrs. Stretham, saying as he did so : \" Go, now, where that letter is addressed, and pay the money, when your goods wfll be restored to you. \" This she declined to do, but, eventually a porter was sent with the letter and the money, and upon the return home of Mrs. Stretham, she found a box that had been left at her shop, con taining the whole of the lace, with the exception of one piece. \" Yes, sir, Brandy BUI.\" \"What?\" \" He isn't a what, sir, he is a who. A gentle man called Brandy Bill, with a dreadful odour of spirits about him, called and said he had come from Mr. Wild for an answer to the letter ; and that if I would take ten guineas with me to Newgate, I might have back my lace.\" \" And what did you do then?\" \" I took the ten guineas, and went and saw Mr. Wild.\" *' Please relate to the court what passed at that interview.\" . \" He said there was a good deal of wickedness in the world.\" \" You had no doubt of that ?\" \"None in the least, sir.\" \" It is quite evident,\" said WUd's counsel, \" that my client was in a most proper and im proving state of mind. The chaplain of Newgate himseU could not have made a juster remark. \"And what did be say next, Mrs. Stretham?\" \"Must I tell, sir?\" \" Certainly\u2014 certainly!\" \" I hope,\" said the Judge, sternly, \" the witness does not intend to prevaricate?\" \"Oh. dear no, my lord! He asked if I was a widow, and bow long I had been so, and whether I thought it was a happy state \" There was a general laugh in Court. \" And what next took place, Mrs. Stretham ?\" \" I told him I was aud it wasn't.\" \"Now, my lord, aud gentlemen of the jury, that is our case. \" The Act of Parliament clearly specifies the case to be 'holding a secret correspondence with felons,' in the shape of negotiations for the re turn of stolen property. \" That is what the prisoner at the bar stands charged with ; and I apprehend, gentlemen of the jury, that you can have no difficulty in coming to a conclusion as regards his guilt.\" The counsel sat down. Then the junior rose. \" Call Catherine Sti .thim \" If possible, in a greater state of perturbation than before, Mrs. Stretham now again made her appearance in the witness-box. As she had already been- sworn, aud had not left the Court, her examination was at once pro ceeded with. \" What do you mean 7' cried the Judge \u2014 \" what do you mean, woman, by ' I was and it wasn't ?' Are you simply ungrammatical or idiotic ?\" \" Anything your lordship pleases, I'm sure ; but, as I've got back my lace, I'd rather not per secute Mr. Wild any longer.\" \"Certainly not!\" cried Wild's Counsel. \"A most proper remark to make.\" \"Now, madam,\" said the junior counsel: \" did you receive a letter dated from Newgate, and signed by Jonathan Wild ?\" \" I did.\" \"My learned friend,\" said the Counsel, who was examining Mrs. Stretham \u2014 \" my learned friend will have an ample opportunity by and by of making any remarks he thinks proper ; but, at present, silence would be judicious. Now, Mrs. Stretham, what further passed at this inter view ?\" \"Where is that letter?\" *: It is here.\" Tho letter was handed up, and read by the Clerk of the Court, as foUows : \u2014 \" Madam, \"Owing to the machinations of my ene mies, who, in all probabiUty, will suffer for it, both here and hereafter, I am, at present, con \u00a3_.o\u201e in Newgate ; and, as under such circum stances, I am desirous of the prayers of all good people. I wish, in order to ontitle myself to \"Ee told me that it was very curious that he, too, was a widower, as five of his wives wore dead, and he didn't know what had become of the other four.\" There was a roar of laughter at this. The Judge checked it to the utmost of his"], [393, "1 EDITH HERON. 387 pewer, but Jonathan Wild thought he would again improve the occasion, and put himself on good, mirthful terms with the Jury. He placed his hand upon the region of his heart, and made a gallant sort of bow to Mrs. Stretham, who returned it with a profound courtesy. This was too much even for the gravity of the Judge, and weU schooled as he was in keeping his countenance, he had to hold up his notes be fore his face to hide his laughter. \"-WeU, Mrs. Stretham,\" continued the counsel, \" after you had become on such exceUent terms with Mr. Wild, I suppose you began to talk about your lost lace ?\" \" Yes, sir.\" \"I asked him what satisfaction he was to havo for his trouble.\" \" And what did he say ?\" \" He said he required only the satisfaction of doing his duty. That he acted from principle in assisting people under misfortune, and that aU he required of me was my prayers for his welfare, since he had many enemies, who were exceed ingly unscrupulous persons, and who, notwith standing a man might be as virtuous as he could, would think nothing of swearing away his life on the first opportunity.\" \" That will do, madam,\" said Wild's counsel. * We need trouble you no further.\" - Mrs. Stretham was released, and then Wild's counsel, with an air of great candour, appealed to the Judge, saying, \" I apprehend, your lord ship wiU be of the same opinion in regard to this indictment as with the first.\" \" I don't know that,\" said the Judge. \" WiU your lords! ap allow me to make a few remarks?\" interposed the counsel for the pro secution. CHAPTER CCCXII. JONATHAN WILD'S TRIAL CONTESITED. \" You have a right to be heard, although, of course, you will, by your speaking, as you well know, give a right of reply to the counsel, for the defence.\" All that had taken place hitherto in regard to the examination of Mrs. Stretham had been merely badinage. The real evidence that was of importance to Wild was coming. \" Certainly, my lord ; and what I have to say will be comprised in a very few sentences. \" This second count in the indictment against the prisoner is framed in exact accordance with the Act of Parliament. And now' there was a more profound silence in the Court as the witness continued : \" I offered him the ten guineas for the return of my lace, and then he wrote a letter, which ho said if I took to the person to whom it was addressed, I should get back my property.\" \"Now, Mrs. Stretham, be so good as to attend to the next question.\" \" IS the correspondence, which the prisoner at the bar is proved to have held with the thieves who stole Mrs. Stretham's lace, .had been for the purpose of their apprehension, of course the case would have been different, but it was merely a kind of traffic, having reference to the restora tion of the property for a reward. \" It is not necessary that I should trouble your lordship with any further remarks, since the Act of Parliament is quite clear, and tho indictment is framed under the Act, while no one wfll be hardy enough to dispute that the evidence is fully sufficient to 6upport the indictment.\" The counsel sat down, and then he who acted for Jonathan WUd rose to address the jury. \" IS there be anything, gentlemen, in thi_ country which we esteem above aU others, it ia that thing which we call even-handed justice, and I would appeal to your hearts and your consciences, asking if the prisoner at the bar ia having that even-handed justice? \" What is it that is alleged against him ? \" I wUl, 6ir.\" \" Who was that letter addressed to ?\" Mrs. Stretham shook her head. \" I don't know, sir. I refused to take the letter, and therefore did not look. \" Are you quite sure of that, witness ?\" asked the judge. \" Quite, my lord.\" \" What happened next ?\" asked the counsel. \" He proposed that a porter should take the money and the letter, and get the lace for me, and take it to my house.\" \" You consented to that arrangement ?\" \" I did.\" \" What then ?\" \" Then I went home, and I found the lace had just been left in a box, and that it was afl right with the exception of one piece.\" \" Then, my lord and gentlemen of the jury,\" said the counsel, sitting down, \" that is the case.\" Mrs. Stretham thought she was released from further examination, and was about to leave the witness box, when she was stopped by Wild's counsel, who said, with an air of great severity, \" A few words more, madam, if you please.\" \" An every-day occurrence. \" Some goods are lost or stolen \u2014 a reward is offered for their recovery, and they are brought back and no questions asked. \" Why, gentlemen of the jury, these are the very terms in which advertisements are drawn up and inserted by the score in the daily papers. \" But I have used the words lost or stolen, and some of you, upon a mere casual consideration of those words, may think that there is an essen tial difference between them. \" Yes, eir.\" \"Did Mr. Wild put the ten guineas in his pocket ?\" \"Oh, dear no.\" \" What became of them 7\" \"He gave them to the porter.\" \" AndVhat did he get for his trouble in the \" In the eye of the law, however, gentlemen of the juiy, there is none; for whether\" I pick up eleven pieces of lace in the middle of tho roadway, or take them from Mrs. Strefnam's shop counter, and retain them one moment after I know who is their rightful owner, i am felo- transaction ?\" \"Nothing.\" \" Nothing ?

Therefore, gentle men of the jury, aU that the prisoner at the bar has done, is the common every-day act of help ing some one, by the offer of a reward, to recover lost property. \" And how did the prisoner act throughout the whole transaction ? \" Did he take any of the reward himself ? Indeed, they never left their box, but after staring at each other for a few moments, the foreman, who, of course, was the biggest, bulkiest, and most stupid of the lot, shook his great fat head, and whispered to the one nearest to him. \" Certainly not \" Did he ask for any material advantage ? \" Certainly not. ' \" I call upon you, gentlemen of the jury, to look at this matter conscientiously, and not to allow yourselves to be swayed by prejudices or irrelevant Btories which may be afloat regard ing the prisoner at tbe bar. \" If he is to be convicted and sentenced to death, let it be for something that your con sciences will approve as a cause of offence, and do. not lend yourselves to the designs of those persons who want to put the prisoner at the bar out of the world, for reasons of their own, and would fain get your assistance in doing so upon the flimsiest pretences.\" The counsel sat down. The ominous whisper went round. Then the jury settled themselves in their box, and stared at the judge. The foreman got up, and gave two coughs. He struck his thumbs into the arm-holes of his waistcoat, which is thought an elegant atti tude by some folks, and waited to be asked what was the verdict. The clerk of the arraigns rose. \" Gentlemen of the jury, what say you ? Do> you find the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty ?\" \" Guilty.\" All eyes were turned to Jonathan Wild. He had so fully expected the verdict, however, that no one could see the sUghtest change in his countenance. The jury looked rather solemnly at each other. It was quite evident that he had produced some effect upon them, and that they were rather in doubt as to the course they should pursue. The Judge then turned towards him. \" Jonathan Wild, after a patient and impartial trial, you have been declared guilty by a jury of your countrymen. Have you anything to say why the sentence of the law should not be passed against you ?\" \" I have,\" said Wild. \" Then the Court is bound to listen to you.\" \"Many thanks,\" said Wild, rather sarcasti cally. \" What I have to say is just this. I have been twenty-two years in the public service, and any time within those twenty-two years an in dictment like this might have been framed against me. I know there's the Act of Parliament quite well \u2014 we all know it \u2014 but it's a dead letter. But the Judge had to sum up. There was the danger to Jonathan Wild. He arranged his notes, and immediately com- menced. \" Gentlemen of the jury, the prisoner at the bar stands arraigned before you on an indict ment framed under a very special Act of Par liament, the penalty of which is death. \" It, therefore, behoves you very carefuUy to consider the evidence. \" That evidence resolves itself to this. \" The prisoner at the bar, knowing that a felony had been committed, places himself in com munication with the person who has been robbed, and, in tolerably plain words, informs her that he knows who is in possession of her property. \" Now. gentlemen of the jury, the person who was so in possession of that property \u2014 namely, Mrs. Stretham's lace \u2014 was the thief, because, as has been very properly stated to you by the counsel for the prosecution, that person is in feloniouB possession, whether he found it or stole it. \" And not only, my lord and gentlemen of the jury, might such an indictment as this have been got up against me at any time, but it may be got up, to-day or to-morrow, against any police officer in the kingdom, or against the City Mar shall, or the Governors of Newgate, Bridewell, or the Compter.\" \" That\" said the Judge, \" will not avail you. The criminality of others, if they comprised half the population, can have no reference to yours.\" \" Thank you, my lord. I was only drawing your attention to the fact that it was just pos sible to make fish of some people and fowl of others ; and now I come to something else- \" It was perfectly well known to the autho rities, including the Secretary of State, that I did busy myself in restoring people their pro perty, after they had been robbed of it by male factors. \" It is quite clear, then, that the prisoner at the bar had established communications with a felon or felons, for other purposes than his or their apprehension. \" What were those other purposes ? \" Clearly, the return of the property on the pay ment of some money. \" Gentlemen of the jury, if that evidence does not support the indictment, I do not know what would ? \" It was one of the modes by which I brought the malefactors themselves to justice. \" It was the trap which I laid for them, and if I had been continued at liberty, the two per sons who stole Mrs. Stretham's lace, instead of being paraded here as King's e\\ -idenc. against me, to tell all sorts of lies, would have been hanged this session. \" My learned brother who appears for the pri soner, has urged that this kind of transaction is so common, that we ought to think nothing of it ; but you must dismiss that consideration from your minds, sinco wo are here to dispense the law as we find it, and not to consider how many times it has been evaded. \" But that's uot it, my lord and gentlemen of"], [395, "389 EDITH HERON. the jury. It's not Mrs. Stretham's lace, or Mr. cr Mrs. Anybody's property, that is in question. \" The fact is, I have been too useful to people in high places, and have Uved too long. \" Too long, my lord and gentlemen of the jury. Too long, because I know too much, and that's the reason they want to hang me.\" \" Permit mo to observe,\" said the Judge, \" that this hue of remark is highly injudicious.\" \" Injudicious !\" said Wild. \" What can you do with a man more than hang him ?\" There was a sUght laugh in court, for those were the days in which the hanging of a man was not thought to be a very serious affair. The spectacle was too common an one to take much hold of the public imagination. \" Yes,\" added Wild, \" that's aU you can do, and, perhaps, there may go two words to that bargain ; for if it is sought to hang me because I know too much about Jacobinism, little State secrets, jobbing and corruption in high places, it is possible that if I am put to it, I may leave more of that information behind me, than it is likely I should utter if I Uved.\" Wild ceased. evening, a warder of the name of Glossopp brought him a tolerably substantial meal, which, however, had to be paid for in ready money. This was the man Wild wanted to see. \" So, Glossopp,\" remarked WUd, \" you don't desert an old friend ?\" \" WeU, Mr. Wild, they thought I knew you best, so they sent me to see U you'd anything particular to say.\" \" I comprehend,\" said Wild. \" This is Friday night.\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild, and hanging Monday is close at hand.\" \" It is, as you kindly remark, Glossopp.\" \" Hem ! Mr. Wild, time is short.\" \" Let us understand each other. I must be outside Newgate to-morrow night, or Sunday night, at the latest.\" Glossopp shook his head. \" I am quite disposed to be Uberal,\" said Wild. \" Name your price, but don't let it be a ridicu lously high one.\" \" There are five of us, Mr. Wild.\" \" Good ! The more the merrier ! A hundred pounds among you will make a pretty purse for each !\" \" Have you said aU you wish to say ?\" asked the Judge. \" I have, my lord ; I leave that little remark for the consideration of all whom it may con cern.\" Glossopp shook his head. \" That won't do, Mr. Wild. We've had a sort of consultation over it at the ' Magpie and Bel lows,' in East Smithfield. In course, we looks upon you as an old friend, and if you can make it a hunched each, why we don't mind seeing what we can do. Jones will be on the lock, BUks and Stephens in the lobby, Mugford wfll be night-watch, and I shaU be warder of the cells. So, you see, that'll make up all five of us ; and if so be you can manage the five hundred, why done's the word, and out you go.\" \" Extortionate rascals !\" said WUd. These observations of Jonathan Wild were defiant enough. At first 6ight they would look injudicious. But well he knew there was nothing to be ex pected from the mercy of his enemies, although there might be something from their fears. The Judge made no further remark, but put ting on the black cap, passed sentence of death upon Wild as briefly as possible. In five minutes more, he occupied a condemned cell in Newgate, and was left to his own re flections. \"We always was.\" \"Five hundred pounds for a Uttle job like that?\" \" That's the price, Mr. Wild, and no mistake. Say done, and we'U set about it.\" Wild rose and paced the narrow cell, clanking his heavy irons with a dolorous sound as he did CHAPTER CCCXIII. so. Gladly would he have dashed out Glossopp's brains there and then, if it would have answered his purpose so to do ; but he controlled his rage, and, turning abruptly upon the warder, he cried, in a loud voice, \" Done ! I accept the terms !\" JONATHAN WILD ENTERS INTO NEGOCIATIONS WITH MR. GLOSSOPP. What were those reflections ? Did he think his circumstances desperate ? Certainly not. Several courses seemed open to Jonathan \" Then, Mr. WUd,\" said Glossopp, \" there's nothing more need be said about it. I will speak to the other feUows, and we wfll get the job done either to-night or on Sunday. But you know we must be quite sure of the cash.\" \" That,\" said Wild, \" you can take my word for.\" Wild. Escape for one. But how ? By force, or by fraud? Wild knew perfectly well, that in the history of all the extraordinary escapes from Newgate, there was always one suppressed fact. That was, tho accomplice or accomplices, which the supposed clever and daring prisoner had within the walls of the prison itself. He knew well, likewise, that among the pre sent warders there were men who had their price, and that that price was by no means a particularly high one. . He sat down upon the little wooden bench, which served for bed and seat alike, and waited. The day wore on, but towards the close of the Glossopp looked rather blank. Wild then burst into a hoarse laugh, as he stopped short, and yelled in Glossopp's ear: \" Did you imagine me such a born idiot as to suppose for a moment you would take my word ? Bah! I wfll tell you how to get the money. Bring me pen and ink, and a slip of paper.\" Writing materials were soon provided for Jonathan Wild, and he scrawled, in large un gainly characters on the slip of paper, the foUow ing words:"], [396, "390 EDITH HERON. they have me here at a disadvantage. I cannot escape them ; and they may come here and do their best to drive me mad !\" \"MENDE2, \"Give up the tin bos. \"Jonathan Wild.\" He rolled his head upon his hand for some few minutes in silence. \" There,\" he said, \"take that to Fleet Market, and ask for Mendez, the slop-seUer. You may find him in the Old Fleet Prison, for he has a sort of den in there as well as outside. He will give you a tin box, and in that tin box you will find the money.\" \" AU right, Mr. Wild. I know his shed in the market, where he buys and seUs thing3 to the country people \u2014 and many a yokel from Barnet has old Mendez fleeced and sent home with scarce a rag to his back.\" Then ho communed with himself in low tones : \u2014 \"If one thing is true about ghosts I don't see why another shouldn't be, and from all I have ever heard or read of them, they oan't make an appearance till midnight. That's nearly an hour yet, so I'U try to sleep.\" He flung himself on the hard bench. He resolutely closed his eyes. After a time his brain began to feel confused and dizzy; and either from the fact that his head was a little lower than his heels, or that he had had several sleepless nights, he feU into a fitful kind of slumber. \" Be off with you !\" cried Wild, \"and remember that Saturday night is better than Sunday night, if the affair could come off then as well, for this place chokes me.\" Wild was left alone again ; and, but that he amused himself by pacing up and down, and uttering terrible imprecations against KeUy, the King's evidence, he would have felt rather duU in that gloomy, condemned cell. How long it lasted he had no means of telling, but it was haunted by many visions ; and at length, with a loud cry, he sprang up to a sitting posture. The prison clock struck twelve. It may have been but the guilty and heated imagination of Jonathan Wild, or there are more wonders in heaven and earth than are dreamt cf in our philosophy ; but amid the gathering dark ness of the cell \u2014 that kind of darkness which seemed to wave about and roll over in huge masses \u2014 he saw, or fancied he saw, human shapes. \" Keep away ! \u2014 keep away !\" he shouted. \" Jack Nagle, I know you ! You were scragged the sessions before last ! Don't stare at me with your eyes half out of your head, and your swoUen hps with the black blood upon them ! Keep away! Gone! \u2014 gone! That's a rehef !\" There was a moment's pause. Then WUd uttered a yeU. \" Look ! \u2014 look !\" he cried. \" I see her coming now ! That's Nancy Hughes ! She was hanged for stealing a pewter flagon from the Cooper's Arms ! Why did she refuse to come and Uve with me, and make herself useful in Little Newgate ? Don't come near me, girl ! Take the rope off your neck ! Don't look at me with your bloodshot eyes ! I don't know how I came to know you with that black and livid face ! Help ! \u2014 help ! Innocent ? Of course you are ! I stole the flagon myseU ! Don't come near me ! Help! murder! Mercy!\" Wild flung himseU back violently. His head came in contact with the rough stone wall of the cell and there was perhaps a merciful end to his vision for that night. He rolled off the wooden bench in a state of insensibility to the stone floor. There he was found in the morning, and the injury he had received gave rise to the report in Newgate that he had attempted suicide during the night Glossopp, however, brought him his break fast He knew that at ten o'clock the warders took their last rounds, and then he expected to see Glossopp again, nor was he disappointed. Carrying a tray, as he had done on the former occasion, Glossopp made his appearance, but he looked gloomy. \" Well ?\" cried Wild, in high harsh tones. \"What now?\" \"Game's up!\" \"What game?\" \"Mendez has bolted, and burnt down his ricketty old shed!\" \" Ah.!\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild, you may stare ; but I thought how it would be when I saw him in the Court at your trial. The moment the word ' Guilty ' was pronounced, he fought his way out, and I don't expect he stayed another hour in London.\" \" The old villain !\" \" Hem ! Is there anything else I can do for you, Mr. Wild?\" \"Look you here, Glossopp. Speak to your comrades, and tell them to trust me for four-and twenty hours after my escape, and they shall have th i money or my head in substitute for it.\" \" Ca i't do it, Mr. Wild,\" said Glossopp ; \"it's aU up ! It must be a ready money business, or not at all. Good night !\" \" Stay yet a moment !\" But Glossopp was gone ; and Wild was once more left to his own reflections in that dreary abode. For some time he amused himself by beating the door with his fetters, so that the whole of that part of Newgate echoed with the blows. Then he sat down moody and discontented on the bonch in his cell, and for half-an-hour uttered low growls, like some wild animal at bay. Suddenly he paused. The prison clock struck eleven. \" Eleven o'clock!\" said Wild. \" Only one tour tiU midnight, and I've no brandy ! How am I to Bleep? How am I to get rid of those\u2014 what do they caU them? \u2014 as tho woman in the play says, thick coming fancies? Are there such things as the spirits of the dead? Because, if there are, \"Come, come, Mr. Wild,\" he said; \"cheer up. After all, you know, it's only a ride down Holborn HiU, and a little airing up the Oxford Road. Why, bless you, it was only last week I heard our doctor say that he was rather of opinion it was pleasant to be hanged than other wise.\""], [397, "I I 391 EDITH HERON. 1 \" Hold your row!\" growled Wild. \"And, besides, you know,\" added Glossopp, \"it's what we most of us must come to, sooner or later.\" \" Be quiet. You are aware that I am con demned to death. I don't know whether they mean it or not, but if they do \u2014 if they reaUy mean to take my life \" Jonathan Wild paced his cell to and fro \u2014 for a time almost forgetful of the presence of Mollifi cation. \" AU, I hope,\" said Wild. \"If I am hanged I should like aU the world to be hanged, only I should Uke them all hanged first.\" \" Bless you, Mr. Wild,\" said Glossopp, \" there'd be nobody to puU your legs then.\" \" Be off !\" roared Wild, \" or IT1 do your a mischief.\" \" Yea,\" said Mortification, \" we are aU ripe, and the sickle cometh \" \" Be quiet, I say ! I wfll not be made a spec tacle, to be hooted by the rabble.

Ripon is a woman of taste, as well as a fine woman, and she affecteth rum.\" \" Give it to me !\" \" Yea, as the Psalmist says, first come, first served ; and the man who taketh his dram from the top of the bottle is more likely to get it than as though he waited for the bottom.\" \" Yes,\" said Wild ; \" but I don't mean you to drink it all.\" \" In course,\" Mr. Wild. \" Then send to No. 67, Wardour Street, for the Reverend Mortification Ripon.\" Glossopp burst into a loud laugh. \" WeU, that's good,\" he said. \" You don't mean to say you look upon old Mortification as a parson, do you ?\" \" I tell you, send for him,\" said Wild. \" He's a dissenting minister of great repute. Send for him ; I will have none other.\" He snatched the bottle from the Ups of tho Reverend Mortification, and finished its contents at a draught. Wild then flung the empty bottle exactly over the head of Mortification, smashing it against the wall of the ceU. \"Why, good gracious, Mr. Wild. He's the joUiest old fence in all London.\" \" I don't care what he is else, but, to me, he is the Reverend Mortification Ripon.\" \" Oh, well, well ; you can have him. It's a sell, I know ; but if you think you can crack the stone jug with his help you are a cleverer feUow than I take you to be, Mr. Wild.\" Wild lapsed into moody silence. And since he had chosen to send for Mortifi cation, the authorities had no resource but to do so. Indeed, they cared very little about it ; and if Wild chose to be satisfied with the ministra tions of the personage he named, why that was his business \u2014 not theirs. By about eleven o'clock, in a state of great tre pidation, Mortification arrived, and was intro duced into the cell. \" Yea,\" said Mortification, \" I very nearly had a glass too much.\" \" I am better,\" said Wild. \" That's the first drop of spirits I've had since my condemnation ; and now, Mortification, as I'm going out of the world, I think I ought to make a clean breast of it, and do all the good I can.\" \" Yea !\" \" So I mean to draw up a list of aU tho fences in London, with particulars of any swag of im portance they have received during the past month.\" \" He alludeth to the spoons !\" said Mortifica tion, in a low tone. \"But,\" added Wild, \" I mean to leaye you and Mrs. Ripon out of the list.\" \" Yea, he repenteth !\" said Mortification. \" That is to say,\" added Wild, speaking louder still, \" if you do exactly what I require.\" Mortification shook his head. , \" Twenty minutes,\" said Glossopp, \" and then time will be up ; so look. aUve, and pray away as fast as you can.\" \" Yea,\" said Mortification, \" as the Psalmist remarks.\" \" Nay, Jonathan, it wiU not do. I am a head and shoulders taller, and it will not do.\" \" What do you mean ?\" \" I mean, it will not do to change clothes with me, and go out of Newgate-\" \" Bah ! I didn't mean any such thing. But I want you to come and see me again in the dusk of this evening, and bring with you i \" \"What?\u2014 a file?\" \"Hold your, row,\" said Wild; \"and take seat.\" \" Truly I will, f 01 my knees shaketh ; and, as the Psalmist remarkB \" \"Nevermind the Psalmist,\" said Wild, as he dealt Mortification a blow on the head with a tin can. \" I want to know what has become of those two dozen teble-spoons, with a Uon's head upon them for a crest ?\" \" What ?\" \" Ob, don't be crying ' what ?' to me ! You bought them of Jerry Blinks, and gave him thirteen-pence an ounco for them.\" \" Yea, aU flesh is grass ; and, as the Psalmist remarks, the spoon that maketh its way into the melting-pot is Uke human wishes \u2014 frail, and a mere bubble.\" \" No. Two ounces of laudanum.\" \" Two ounces ?\" \" I said so.

No ; it's only a Uttle sedative, to make me sleep.\" \" A Uttle sedative ?\" said Mortification. \"Two ounces of sedative ?.\" \" 6peak, man !

There's fifty guineas reward offered for the apprehension of Jerry BUnks, and twenty more for any information re garding the tablespoons with the lion's crest upon them. Would you like to occupy the next cell to this ? Say yea if you would, and there's an end of it.\" CHAPTER CCCXIV FELIX HERON AND THE EARL OF BRIDGEWATER VISIT JONATHAN WILD IN NEWGATE. These events in the life and career of Jonathan Wild were watched with a peculiar interest by the little party assembled at Castleneau House. It was not possible but that, mixed up as their various fortunes had been with the career of the great thief-taker, that they should feel deeply interested in what befell him. \" Nay,\" said Mortification. \" You agree to do it, then ?\" said Wild, with emphasis. \" Yoa, verily,\" replied Mortification. \" Then you will bring the laudanum ; and remember, keep faith with me, or you are lost ! Now, be off. You are the only fool I can trust in this little matter. Be off with you, I say \u2014 for I am apt to be dangerous !\" The Reverend Mortification left the prison, and, with many groans, took his way to Wardour Street. One by one, those enemies who had beset the life of Felix Heron, seemed now to be passing away. John Tarleton was no more, and Edith was freed from the constant fear of a collision between him and her husband. She could not have blamed Heron if that col lision had been fatal to her brother ; but such an occurrence would have been none the less sad as a subject for reflection. Stopping outside the door for a few minutes, in order to consider whether he should acquaint Mrs. Ripon or not with Wild's demand, Mortifi cation was startled by some one, as it appeared to him, dropping from the clouds on to his shoulders. But, perhaps, the most important personage for evil who had disappeared from life's drama, so far as the Earl and Countess of Whitcombe were concerned, was, undoubtedly, Lord War ringdale. It wiU be recollected that on the death of that personage, there had been taken from him a number of documents and papers, to get posses sion of which he had ventured into the chamber of death, at the \"Thatched House Tavern,\" where lay John Tarleton. Those papers were temporarily in the posses sion of Colonel Trelawney ; but it was not until the Saturday evening, and after the conviction of Jonathan Wild, that they were carefuUy ex amined at Castleneau House. \"Murder!\" *' What's amiss ?\" cried Tom Ripon, as he took another leap, and fairly cleared the Reverend Mortification's head, alighting in front of him. M What's the matter now, old Mortification-in law?\" \"Yea, Thomas, thou mistaketh. I am thy step-parent, not thy lawful one, heaven be \u2022thanked !\" \" Amen !\" said Tom. \" Where have you been?\" \" To Newgate.\" \u25a0\" Then it was to see Jonathan Wild ?\" \" Yea, Thomas ; and he wanteth two ounces of something, to save him from a ride down Holborn Hill in a certain cart.\" They were found to contain a complete record of all the steps taken, and forgeries committed, for the purpose of depriving Heron of his inheri tance. Tom looked serious. \" I tell you what it is, Mortification,\" he said, \" I don't half Uke Johnny Wild being tucked up in this kind of way. If he had gone off with a pistol-shot in his head, on a moonlight night, on the heath or the road, it would have looked more natural.\" Indeed, so perfect were they in evidence, both negative and positive, of the true position of Felix Heron as Earl of Whitcombe, that both Colonel Trelawney and the Earl of Bridgewater were of opinion that the King would find it impossible to resist the proofs. The Marquis of Ormond only dissented. \" Do not be sanguine,\" he said, \" with regard to any appeal to the Monarch. He is deeply prejudiced against Whitcombe ; and I have no doubt that it arises from this one fact, that he has been thoroughly convinced by Lord Clacking ton of a kind of private hostiUty on the part of Whitcombe, which he wfll never forgive.\" \" I think I comprehend what you mean, \" said Heron. \" Yea, Thomas, it would. But about the two ounces. What say you? There is cunning iu thy eyes, Thomas, and on the point of thy turned-up nose there sitteth wisdom. What sayest thou, Thomas ? Thy own time to be hanged will come some day, therefore, speak out and say what thou thickest. \" \" You are too good,\" said Tom Ripon. \" My turned-up nose is of opinion that if Jonathan Wild chooses it, he ought to be spared the ride to Tyburn. So get him the two ounces, Mortifica tion ; and you may depend upon it, I'U do as much for you at any time.\" \" We will think about it, Thomas. Come in, Is it business? Ah, Thomas! Thou art idle, \u2022and the melting pot has yearned for something from thee in vain.\" \" Yes,\" added the Marquis, \" the King thinks that you made it the business of your Use, of late, to foU him in the pursuit of his private pleasures ; and the occurrences that took place at that mys terious house in PaU Mall, close to the Palace, have given a colour to the idea.\" \" Then,\" said Heron, \" let us give up all notion of any appeal to the King. I can wait \u2014 he is not immortal.\" \" Get along with you,\" said Tom. \" I want to see the old girl.\" The Rev. Mortification opened the door with a latch-key, and admitted himself and Tom Ripon to the fence. \" It is wisely determined, Felix,\" said Lady Castleneau. \"There is no one now particu larly interested in harrassing or annoying you."], [399, "393 EDITH HERON. You still hold your disguise as Captain Fantome, and I should recommend that it be held until this false King is no more.\" Upon this strong expression of opinion, both from Felix Heron and Lady Castleneau, all further idea of an appeal to the monarch was abandoned. Heron then spoke seriously. \"Although I shall not visit at St. James's Palace, nor attempt to awaken the justice of the King, there is another person whom I should hke to see before he and the world bid each other good bye.\" \"Oh, no, no, Felix!\" exclaimed Edith; \"the risk is too great!\" \" Yon guess the person I mean, said Heron, as he took her hand. \" Yes. You want to go to Newgate, to see Jonathan Wild.\" Heron's friends looked grave at this proposi tion, but he spoke lightly of it No. 102\u2014 Edith Heron. I \" You may depend there i& no danger, and L shall not feel satisfied unless I speak a few worda to Jonathan Wild. His hostility to me assumed so new and extraordinary a shape lately, that I have looked upon it in quite a different light, and I think the visit might easily be arranged with perfect security.'' \" There is an old proverb,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater, \" that a wilful man must have his way, and I suppose it will bo carried out in this instance. But, if you do go, you ought not to go alone.\" \" That I care nothing about,\" said Heron. 41 So if you will accompany me, Bridgewater, I shall be glad of your society.\" \"Como along then, at ouce,\" eaid tho Earl, \" and let it be got over. I can easily procure an order from the Sheriff for our admittance to Newgate ; and, if you must go there, Whitcombe, I think it much safer that the interview should take place at night than in the day-time.\""], [400, "EDITH HER0W 394 \" Oh, don't mention it !\" said Wild. \u2014 \" It's only a wonder tbat I have not done you a mischief, believing you to be either the Baron Von Peck or Captain Fan tome \u2014 neither of whom I thought a good enough man to stand in the shoes of Fehx Heron, of Epping Forest.\" \" You forget,\" said Heron, \" that since that Felix Heron was well able to take care of him self in life, so he was equaUy weU able to do so when he was disguised as either of those per sonages.\" \" You consent, Edith ?\" asked Heron. \" I do with my reason, but not with my heart. I fear danger ; but if you assure me that there is none, I will believe that my fears, are ground less, and will urge them, no longer.\" \" Be assured,\" said Heron, \" that if I thought there was the least sensation of danger in the transaction, I would not now, for the sake of those near and dear to me, engage in it.\" \" Come, then, at once, Whitcombe,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater. \"My carriage is in the courtyard, and I do not see why within the next hour-and-a-half this interview may not be got over, for I, too, have a question to ask of Jona than Wild.\" Heron and the young Earl accordingly left Castleneau House, and drove rapidly to the City. Wild bit his Up, but rejoined : \" Ah, true, true ! Well, then, my Lord Whit combe, I thank you for your visit ; and what can I do for you, my Lord Bridgewater ?\" \" I wish to ask you one question, Jonathan Wild ; and it is from a fuU conviction that you are the only man in this world who can satis factorily answer me, that I ask it\" The Sheriffs and great dignitaries of London at that time lived within the precincts of the City itseU, and the Sheriff, who had it in his power to grant an order to see Jonathan Wild, was to be found most readily at his bouse in Al dermanbury. Wild nodded. \" I think I know what it is, my Lord ; but 'go on. Ask, aud I wfll answer you.\" \" Do you of your own knowledge know be yond a doubt that Lord Warringdale was tbe murderer of my father ?\" \" I do.\" The Sheriff was at home, and the rank of the Earl of Bridgewater at once procured an audi ence. \" That is quite sufficient I do not say that you have lifted a weight off my head, or that you have removed any doubt upon the subject, but stfll it is a subject upon one of those matters on which we Uke to have assurance made doubly sure.\" Fehx Heron remained in the carriage, but in a few moments Bridgewater returned with the necessary pass to Newgate, and they soon stood in the vestibule of the prison. The pass ran thus : \u2014 \" I not only know that he did it,\" said Wild, \" but I know why he did it\" \" Why was it ? I never was quite sure of the motive.\" \"Admit the Right Honourable the Earl of Bridgewater and friend to a private interview with tho convict Jonathan Wild. \" Philip Hammerslet, Sheriff.\" \" Your father, the late Ear], was what is called a sporting man, and fond of play. Lords War- ringdale had lost to him large sums at faro, and in your father's possession were the acknowiedg .ments for those sums. Moreover, a growing suspicion was beginning to roach magnitude among a certain set that Warringdale cheated at play, and your father had set himself the task of detecting him on the first opportunity.\" \" Enough, enough ! \" said Bridgewater. \" These are ample motives, indeed !\" \" But yet there was another,\" added Wild. \" Indeed ?\" This pass was all-sufficient. But the visitors were not taken to Wild's ceU ; on the contrary, he was brought to them in one of those small vaulted chambers called \"waiting rooms,\" where, as we have before stated, pri soners held interviews with their legal ad visers. Wild looked haggard and worn. The room was Ut by a single candle, placed upon a rough oaken table in its centre. Heron kept back in the shadow, so that at first Wild could not see who it was who accom panied the young Earl of Bridgewater. \" Yes, and the worst of aU.\" \" Can there be any worse ?\" \"You shaU hear. He wanted to accuse his So soon, however, as the door was closed Heron stepped forward. half-brother here, the real Earl of Whitcombe, of some crime which should bring him to a disgrace ful and an untimely end. Accident favoured him, and the admiration which your father bestowed upon Daisy, FeUx Heron's horse, furnished War ringdale with the opportunity, for it brought the Earl of Whitcombe in communication with your father in that retired lane where he met his death.\" \" Ah !\" exclaimed Wild. \" The Earl of Whit combe ?\" \" Yes,\" said Heron ; \" you know me ?\" \" I 'do, and I fully expected you would visit mo.\" \" What for, Mr. Wild ?\" \" I hardly know, but there might be some things you would wish to ask me.\" \" Thank you, Jonathan Wild. I now know as much as I suspected there was to know.\" \" You are very welcome, my lord.\" \" Can we do anything for you, Jonathan Wild ?\" asked Felix Heron. \" It was so, although I can hardly say it is so. AU questions are useless now, and per haps it is better that I should ask none.\" Nevertheless, I will answer, my Lord Whit combe, anything you choose to ask.\" \" No, I will ask nothing ; and therefore I will not strip this visit of one of its motives ; but rather leave that motive alone, and say that I came to see you, and freely forgive you fo_ all \"Oh, yes!\" said Wild, with a grimace ; \"take me out of Newgate.\" \" That you know we cannot do ; but if we could what would bo the course you would the past.\" adopt ?\""], [401, "395 EDITH HERON. \" I should turn a highwayman, and persuade Tom Ripon to come with me on the road.\" Heron shook his head. levelled at him, so that by making the King a party to the quarrel, he got him into that frame of mind which induced him to take steps very much to the detriment of the whole party at Castleneau House. \"Come, Bridgewater,\" he said, \" we have stayed here long enough. Remember, Jonathan Wild, that the visit I have paid you, and the words I have spoken to you, have been solely on account of the kind of protection you seemed disposed to accord to Edith and her child when you thought I was no more.\" There was a secret adviser of the King's, who had once been in the law, of the name of Holt. This man was of too notoriously bad a character to permit even the monarch himself to place him in any high legal position. Holt however, knew the law ; and it was a great fancy of the King's to hold a consultation with him previous to any meeting of the privy council, and so astonish and bewilder the law lords of the crown with a smattering of legal inteUigence. \" That'U do,\" said Wild. \" Good day ! We shall meet no more.\" \" No more,\" added Heron ; \" for you would hardly wish me to be present at your execution ?\" Wild laughed. \" Perhaps, you'd be disappointed if you were to try,\" he said. \" What mean you ?\" \"Nothing, only that the crowd might be great, that is all ; and now good-bye, my Lord Whitcombe, and you, my Lord Bridgewater, and when next you hear of Jonathan Wild, it may, perhaps, be something to remember.\" Heron and his friend Bridgewater left New gate, and it is scarcely necessary to say that their arrival in safety at Castleneau House was a subject of sincere congratulation to Edith and to Lady Castleneau. But it would appear that the perils of Heron were not yet over. When Clackington, therefore, sought the pri vate cabinet of the King, and began to detiil his wrongs, Holt was sent for. Previously, however, to the arrival of that personage, my Lord Clackington and His Ma jesty held an interesting conversation. \" I thought you had hanged yourself,\" said tho King, \" as I had not seen you lately.\" \"Certainly not, your Majesty,\" replied Clack ington ; \" I should not think of hanging myself while your Majesty stfll existed.\" \" Stfll existed \u2014 still existed !\" replied the King. \" We mean always to exist.\" Lord Clackington smiled. \" Your Majesty's physicians are of a different opinion.\" ,\" Hang the physicians !\" cried the King. \" I have discharged them all, and sent for Doctor Blottesbury, from Hanover.\" Clackington bowed. \" But now teU me, what was the object of shutting you up in this Castleneau House, in Bloomsbury Fields ?\" \" It was to keep me there a prisoner until your Majesty died.\" \"Died \u2014 died! Ah, ah! Let me see! That is petty treason, imagining the demise of the Crown.\" It was towards tho dusk of that evening that Ogle came and made a positive statement that the house was watched by several armed men. Tom Eipon, likewise, was decidedly of opinion that there were suspicious characters in the fields immediately over the garden waU., \"What makes you think so, Tom?\" asked Heron. \" Why, Captain, I saw a feUow put his face up over the parapet, and he was ugly enough to give me a very bad opinion of him ; so I thought I would give him a hint to be off.\" \" What sort of a hint, Tom?\" \" Only a brick, Captain ; and it broke in two on the side of his head. I didn't see him after that.\" \" Assuredly so, your Majesty.\" \" Then the whole household can be taken on a warrant to that effect !\" \" There is only one consideration,\" said Lord Clackington, \" which I would submit for your Majesty's gracious consideration.\" \"What is it?\" \"It is simply this. That viUanous Felix Heron, who calls himseU Earl of Whitcombe, is aware of the proceedings at the house in Pall MaU, where a certain society hold their sittings. I believe he not only knows of your Majesty's presidency of that society, but is aware, likewise, of the names of some of its members.\" \" WeU, what then ? That man's dead !\" \" I am not quite so sure of that,\" said Lord Clackington, speaking with slow emphasis. \"Ah!\" \"Yes, your Majesty. While a prisoner at Cas tleneau House, although it was of no use to keep my eyes open, at least, for a time, my ears were of some service.\" \"Ah!\" said the King; 'they were always very long.\" \" I should think not. But this is worth con sideration, Ogle. I have one enemy yet who, while the King Uves, wfll be active and impla cable.\" \"Yes,\" said Lady Castleneau, \"we should have kept a tighter hold over my Lord Clack ington when we had him.\" CHAPTER CCCXV. LORD CLACKINGTON'8 PLANS ARE FRUSTRATED. There was something exceedingly vexatious in the idea that this man, Lord Clackington, should have it in his power still to be, in the remotest degree, troublesome to FeUx Heron. Such however, was the case ; for immediately upon his escape from Castleneau House he had made his way to the King, with a long list of grievances, and calling aloud for vengeance upon everybody at Castleneau House. Lord Clackington was quite ingenious enough to make the King believe the whole proceeding \" We courtiers,\" said Lord Clackington, \" hum bly imitate your Majesty.\" The King made a growling noise."], [402, "EDITH HEItON. 396 \" And so,\" added Lord Clackington, \" I kept my ears open, and twice, while a prisoner in that house, I heard the name of Felix pronounced in such a manner that it could only be to a living person.\" you please, and report to us at the first con venient opportunity.\" Armed with this kind of authority, my Lord Clackington set about those proceedings which brought the gang of suspicious-looking persons into the vicinity of Castleneau House. Mr. Holt was very unfortunate in his first attempt at reconnoitring the premises, for his was the head which Tom Ripon thought so ugly and obtrusive, and at which he threw the brick. \" Felix ?\" \" Yes ; that is tho wretch's name \u2014 FeUx Heron. The name was pronounced in a female voice, which was, no doubt, that of his miserable wfle, Edith.\" \" So, so !\" \"Yes, your Majesty. And from the general tone of hilarity in tho house, and tbe laughter I heard at times, combined with another incident, I am convinced tbe scoundrel Uves.\" Mr. Holt, however, although damaged to some extent, was not completely disabled, and he sat with his back against the wall in Bloomsbury Fields, vowing vengeance against the occupants of Castleneau House. \" What was the other incident ?\" \" There is an ugly brat of a child, which I heard pronounce the name of father several times.\" There was a large old fig-tree growing close to the wall, on the inner side of the garden, and then it was a very ornamental object, although it stretched its arms out into Bloomsbury Fields. Lady Castleneau would not have it interfered with. The King shook his head. \" I don't know what to make of it, my Lord Clackington; but we will see Holt.\" At this moment, singularly enough, one of the pages of tbe back-stairs announced that per sonage, who was at once ushered into the King's cabinet. That portion of the waU which it over shadowed was always dark, and, as various shrubs grew in the field on the other side, the spot altogether formed a kind of retreat in which persons might hide themselves easily. It was towards evening, then, that Ogle, as he took his rounds in the garden of Castleneau House, upon passing this spot, fancied he heard a whispered consultation going on among the bushes and 6hrubs on the other side of the waU. The whole affair was laid before him, and, assuming a look of great wisdom he pronounced his opinion. \" Let the house be thoroughly watched and guarded in aU directions,\" he said. \" I think a warrant may issue for the apprehension of Felix Heron \u2014 falsely calling himself Earl of Whit combe \u2014 and of bis wife, likewise of Lady Castleneau, and every person in the house. Heron himself of course is apprehended for felony and petty treason, and the others aU for simple felony, in aiding and abetting the escape of a prisoner.\" \"But our death, Holt; they have all com passed and imagined our death.\" \"Not compassed it, your Majesty; but they may have imagined it\" \" Well, that is sufficient.\" \" There is no evidence. My Lord Clackington only imagines that to be the reason why he was kept in durance ; but it is quite easy for your Majesty to have a warrant issued on the terms I state, and I should recommend that when tho house is so well surrounded, as it may be, that any one of the parties named in the warrant should be apprehended upon their attempt to leave it.\" The fig-tree would have been a capital post from which observation and espial might be made, but Ogle's climbing days were passed or passing, and it would have been no easy matter for him to assume quietly a snug position among its branches. Under these circumstances, Ogle immediately sought Tom Ripon, and, informing him of what was taking place, suggested his chmbing the tree, from whence he could both listen and look to what was taking place. Tom was in the tree in a couple of minutes, and, in fact, he crawled outward upon some of the branches that stretched quite into Blooms bury Fields. From that advantageous position, he had no difficulty in seeing that three or four persons were in close conversation at the foot of the wall. The first voice he heard, Tom felt convinced was that of Lord Clackington. \" Be it so \u2014 be it so !\" cried the King. \" Let the warrant issue. We leave the matter in your hands, Clackington, and in your's, Holt. Imagine our death, indeed ! Keep you, my Lord Clack ington, a prisoner untU wo die ; and at your age, too !\" There was no mistaking the croaking accents of that person. \" I shaU be glad when this job is over, and if we succeed in getting that feUow, Felix Heron, I shall only be too glad. Nothing Uke making a certain person think that it was a spite against him that induced them to imprison me.\" \" A capital idea,\" returned the voice, which be longed to Holt ; \" and while I have been sitting here I have made up my mind as to the course we had better pursue.\" \"Ah, that is well!\" croaked Lord Clackington \u2014 \" that is well ! Out with it, Holt !\" \" Even so, your Majesty.\" \" Why \u2014 why that is equivalent to imagining that we shall die before you.\" \" It looks like it, your Majesty.\" \"Ishouldliketohang them all \u2014 to gibbet them all ! See to it \u2014 see to it, my Lord Clackington ; and if this fellow, Heron, 0/ Whitcombe, or whatever he calls himself, be really alive, and thero should be any souffle, you understand, in which a few pistol shots should fly about, and one of them should accidentally hit him, why it HSU be all thc better. See to it, gentlemen, if \" Hush ! Not so loud \u2014 you know not who may bo listening !

I can tell you it has made me feel anything but comfortable.\" is a large force outside the walls of the mansion, and although I am quite assured that Lord Clack ington would have ho chance with you were you alone with him, yet you cannot expect to fight single-handed a dozen or more skilled men.\" \" All right, Captain. I'll be as careful at pos sible.\" \" Never mind your feelings. Tell us your plans,\" said Lord Clackington, impatiently. \" Well, then, I propose that we stay here quietly until about ten o'clock this evening, and then you and I, with as many of our fellows as possible, break into the house. A general melee may then take place, in which it is to be un derstood that this Felix Heron is to be shot, if possible.\" \"Yes\u2014 yes! Capital! Goon!\" \" Oh, that's syour Uttle game, you old vaga bond,\" said Tom Ripon to himself ; \" we'll just see who is the cleverest, you or me !\" Tom was now only too anxious to make his way into Castleneau Honse, in order to report to Felix Heron the result of his eavesdropping. Ogle was anxiously awaiting him at the foot of the tree. Tom left the room. Then Lady Castleneau looked anxiously at Heron as she said, \" What do you intend to do, Felix?\" \" I scarcely know until Bridgewater comes ; but I do not apprehend any serious danger.\" \" Still it would be wise to provide against it,\" suggested Edith. \" Yes,\" said Lady Castleneau ; \" I wish you would let me advise.\" \" Speak, dear aunt,\" said Felix, taking her hand in his \u2014 \" speak ; and if I can I will foUow your counsel, for it is ever good and wise.\" Lady Castleneau looked gratified and re- Ueved. \" Well, Tom, have you heard anything that can give us an idea of what they are about?\" \" Yes, Ogle ! Don't stop me \u2014 I must go to the Captain at once!\" Tom sped up the grand staircase, and without any ceremony, entered the Drawing-room, where were assembled in consultation FeUx Heron, Edith, and Lady Castleneau. \" Then, Felix, I would advise that, if the house be broken into, you should not take part in the melee, as you hear the purport of it is to kfll you !\" Edith clasped her hands over her face, and sobbed aloud. \" Nay, Edith, dear,\" said Felix Heron ; \" you so brave ordinarily, to be so overcome by a re mote contingency ! Let me speak \u2014 believe me, I will not, for your sake, needlessly expose my life to these ruffians.\" Tom closed the door behind him, as he said in a hurried whisper, \" They are going to break into the house, at ten o'clock, Captain \" \" Break into the house ?\" said Edith, with an alarmed look. \" What for ?\" As Tom sped on his mission, looking to the right and to the left, lest he should be watched, he had the satisfaction of seeing Lord Bridge water's carriage approach. \" I must stop it if it costs my Use !\" said Tom to himself as he sprung off the pavement into the roadway. This sudden advent caused the coachman to draw rein so abruptly that the fiery steeds reared. \" To murder the Captain No, not that exactly,\" said Tom, as he saw Lady Castleneau aDd Edith turn pale. \" Tom,\" said Felix Heron, \" speak so that we can understand you. What have you heard and seen ?\" Tom now gave Heron a tolerably correct report of the conversation he had overheard between Lord Clackington and a man whom he had ad dressed by the name of Holt. \" Holt ! \u2014 Holt?\" said Felix Heron. \" Surely that name is known to me. Ah ! I have it ! \u2014 it is a man whom the King consults when he is in _oubt as to the legaUty of any proceeding he is about to undertake.\" \" Is there much danger, Felix ?\" asked Edith. \" No, dear one !\" replied Heron. \"But I wiU just send you, Tom, to my friend the Earl of Bridgewater with a note.\" Felix Heron sat down to a table on which were writing materials, and wrote the following words : \u2014 \" Stop !\" cried Tom. \" I must speak to the Earl of Bridgewater !\" The coachman recognised Tom ; and at tbat moment the young Earl put his head out of the window to inquire what was the meaning of the stoppage. \"I beg your pardon, my lord, \" said Tom ; \" but I have a note from the Earl of Whitcombe to your lordship, and I was so afraid that your carriage would pass me that I was obliged to do something desperate to prevent \" The young Earl smiled. \"You are a sharp fellow, Tom. Give me the letter.\" \" Dear Bridgewater, \u2022' Can you come and bring with you to Castleneau House our two friends, Colonel Tre lawney and the Marquis of Ormond? \" In haste, from yours faithfully, \" Whitcombe.\" The letter was handed into the carriage, and the young earl read it by the aid of an oil lamp, which happened at that moment to be burn ing rather brightly. \" This is fortunate, indeed,\" he exclaimed, turning to his two companions, whom Tom in his anxiety, had not noticed before. \" This is fortunate, indeed. We must give up our engage ment to-night, for Whitcombe requires our pre sence at Castleneau Hou6. without delay.\" \" Ah !\" exclaimed Colonel Trelawney and the Marquis of Ormond, in a breath. \" Let us pro ceed, then, without delay.\" Bridgewater turned to Tom Eipon, and smiling \"Do you think, Tom,\" said Felix, turning to his young follower, \" that you can contrive to convey that to Bridgewater House?\" \" I should think I could, Captain ! Why I could send my Lord Clackington spinning over tbe top of the house if he attempted to interfere or impede my progress !\" '\u2022 Do not be rash, Tom. Remember that there"], [404, "EDITH HERON. 398 \" I do, indeed, Whitcombe ; and when I tell you my reasons for so doing, I am sure, for the sake of those who are so dear to you, you wiU not object to my plans.\" Colonel Trelawney smiled. \" I see .what you would propose, Ormond, you wish Whitcombe, with Edith and their chfld, together with Lady Castleneau, to retire to those secret apartments, and let us meet these foes, and treat them according to their deserts.\" \" Exactly so. Will you agree, Whitcombe?\" \" What says my Edith ?\" asked Heron. \" Is she wiUing that I should depute to others the task of defending her and our child ?\" \" Under the present circumstances,\" said Edith, \" I feel inclined to agree with the advice that has been given, Felix, and I will tell you why. If Lord Clackington should be armed with a warrant from the King for your apprehension, it would be madness to attempt to elude it ; there fore, I would say to you, foUow the advice of these your best friends, and let us hope that all may yet be weU.\" \" I agree, then,\" said Felix; \" although I must say, it is a difficult task you have imposed upon me.\" kindly at him, he said, \"Mount the box with Christopher, my lad, and give directions for him to drive with all speed to Castleneau House.\" CHAPTER CCCXVI. LORD CLACKINGTON AND MR. HOLT ENTERTAINED AT SUPPER AT CASTLENEAU HOUSE. A very short time sufficed to bring the three friends to Castleneau House, and as the carriage roUed into the court-yard, Tom Ripon glanced about him, and fancied he could discern through the darkness several dusky-looking figures loung ing under the walls of the mansion. Old Anthony admitted the three friends, and ushered them into the drawing-room, where they were bo anxiously expected. \" Welcome, my friends,\" said Felix Heron, and he held out his hand to each ; \" but surely Tom must have hurried you, even more than the occasion warranted, for it seems but a few moments since he left the house.\" The Earl of Bridgewater now passed on to Edith, and, looking at her earnestly, he said, \" What can have happened that we find you all so gloomy ? Tell me, Whitcombe, has anything new transpired ?\" \" Be seated,\" said FeUx Heron, '\" and I wfll teU you all in a few words, for I fancy there is no time to lose.\" \"Well, then,\" said Colonel Trelawney, \" now that we are all agreed as to our future plans, let us proceed to details.\" At this moment Lady Castleneau re-entered the room, looking somewhat pale, but calm and coUected, as though she were prepared to brave any danger with those she loved. Colonel Trelawney took upon himseU: to make her acquainted with what had been proposed and agreed to, and asked her if it met with ner per fect concurrence, or whether she had anything better to propose. \" It is well agreed,\" said Lady Castleneau, pressing the hand of Colonel Trelawney. \"I hoped that such might be the arrangement, but I feared almost to propose it to FeUx, knowing how much he would prefer taking part in the fray which we have to expect. I have just given orders for fires to be lighted in the suite of apart ments which you have mentioned, as I thought it would, at aU events, be a secure refuge for Edith and her child.\" \" And while you are relating our cause for un easiness, Felix, to these kind friends, I wfll go and give some necessary directions to Martha and Old Anthony.\" FeUx Heron held open the drawing-room door as Lady Castleneau passed out, and then return ing to his seat, he explained, as briefly as pos sible, the circumstances in which they were placed, and aU that Tom Ripon and Ogle had reported respecting the man's head which had been seen peering over the wall. Colonel Trelawney looked grave for a moment, as he said, \" I suspect that Lord Clackington is fct the bottom of it, and that he may, by some means, havo obtained the King's permission to search this house for FeUx Heron.\" \" Thanks, Lady Castleneau,\" said Trelawney. \" Now I am going to ask you to install me as master of the house for the time being \u2014 that is, I wish to feel that I have your authority for any thing I may think it best to do.\" \" Most certainly,\" repUed Lady Castleneau, \" consider that you have a right to order any thing you please. I feel assured that whatever you do I shall think well done, and so will FeUx and Edith.\" \"But,\" said Edith, \"he, as weU at the rest of the world, believes that Felix is no more.\" \"\u2022It may be so ; but still we must take our precautions, and suppose that is the object of their vi6it?\" Edith looked at Felix, and laying her hand upon his arm, she said, \" Remember, Felix, there must be no more separations. Together we wfll meet whatever troubles may yet be in store for us.\" \" Then,\" said Colonel Trelawney, smiUng, \" I shaU begin by dismissing you aU to your hiding place, and then I shall order a supper in th;i breakfast-parlour for myself and my two friends here.\" The Marquis of Ormond, who had hitherto been silent, now spoke \u2014 \" I believe,\" he said, \"that there are secret apartments in this old mansion, where it would be quite possible for to secret oneself without the remotest chance of being discovered. Are there not, Whitcombe?\" \" Yes,\" said Heron, \" but you do not intend 'o make me hide myself from such a man as my Lord Clackington ? \" As Felix Heron spoke, there was a flashfin his fye tbat spoke of courage and bravery not easily daunted. Felix Heron could not but smile as Colonel Trelawney thus spoke. \" Come, then,\" he said, addressing Lady Castle neau, \" we wfll repair to our quarters.\" At this moment Edith looked at Trelawney, and said, \" You will let us hear from you as soon as possible \u2014 wo shall be so anxious.\" \" Certainly ! Most assuredly, we wiU join"], [405, "] i 399 EDITH HERON. i you as soon as ever we havo disposed of our troublesome foes outside.\" There was now a hasty sound of footsteps, and the door of the breakfast room was flung open. Mr. Holt, the King's private legal adviser, with a drawn sword in his hand, and closely followed by Lord Clackington, stood upon the threshold. Holt's appearance was partly ferocious, and partly ludicrous. The brick that Tom Ripon had flung at him had by no means improved his beauty, and he had a handkerchief wound round his head, which was spotted with blood. He had pistols iu his girdle, and there could be no doubt but that Lord Clackington wa3 similarly armed. A few paces behind them were four ruffianly looking feUows, who evidently belonged to the very lowest class of police constables. With weU-acted looks of surprise, the three gentlemen, who were sitting at supper, rose to their feet. In another five minutes Lady Castleneau, Edith, Felix, and their child, were in safety and comfort There was a look of stern determination on the face of Ogle, as he made his way into that apartment now so familiar to the reader, in which those attached friends of Felix Heron and Edith were assembled. \" I havo been reconnoitering the garden,\" he said, \" and there are half-a-dozen fellows getting over the waU near the fig-tree.\" Old Anthony nearly dropped one of the large, old-fashioned silver dishes, as he heard this in telligence. Colonel Trelawney only smiled, and exchanged meaning glancees with the Earl of Bridgewater and tho Marquis of Ormond. \"Let them come!\" he said. \" Wo are quite prepared for them. Set all the dishes upon the table, Anthony, and then le_pe the room both of you ; but be sure you place by my side a flagon cf that old Constantia wine.\" \" What is the meaning of this intrusion V asked Colonel Trelawney. \" Yes,\" added the Earl of Bridgewater, \" this most unwarrantable intrusion.\" These directions were complied with, although neither Anthony nor Ogle could form the slight est conception of what was the plan of opera tions of the Colonel. Lord Clackington looked surprised, and lower ing the point of his sword, he gazed from face to face of those three gentlemen whom he \"knew so well, with a puzzled expression, at finding them in Castleneau House. Itwas quite evident, however, that Trelawney had arranged something which would end in the signal discomfiture of those persons who were making their way into tbe grounds of Castleneau House, on an errand inimical to the peace and happiness of its inhabitants. And now that breakfast-room was deserted by aU but the three gentlemen, who sat there appa rently enjoying their supper. \" Gentlemen,\" he said, \" I know you quite well, and you know me.\" \" My Lord Clackington !\" they aU said, as with one voice. \" Exactly, gentlemen. I am here on his Majesty's service, and I sincerely trust, that far from receiving any obstruction from you, I shaU meet with every assistance.\" \" It is all over,\" said Trelawney, in a deep, solemn voice. The room was but dimly lighted, inasmuch as but one silver-branched candestick, carrying six wax lights only, stood upon the table. In an apartment of such large dimensions, and so lofty in its ceiling, that amount of light was manifestly insufficient It was sufficient, however, to show the supper table well enough, and at all events, the faces of the three gentlemen who sat at it. \" Yes, \" remarked the Earl of Bridgewater, \" the game is played out.\" \"And the stakes are death,\" said the young Marquis of Ormond. Lord Clackington looked from one to the other of them, as they thus spoke, and was perfectly at a loss to comprehend the mysterious character of such expressions. In a few seconds more they were alone. \" Listen !\" said Trelawney. \" My duty, my lords, \" he said, \" is to search this house.\" There came a heavy knocking at the front door of the house. \" And mine, too !\" cried Holt, '1 although, iu consequence of a ruffianly outrage to which I have been subjected, I can only see out of one eye.\" \" I thought they were going to take the old mansion by storm,\" remarked the Earl of Bridge water. '\u2022 Doubtless they are,\" said the Colonel; \"and that is merely one of their number sent round to the front to attract our attention, while they break in at the rear.\" \" I hear them !\" cried the Marquis of Ormond. There was a distinct sound as of the breaking of glass in one of the windows of the ground floor that opened from the terrace at the back of the house. '\u2022 There may be,\" said Colonel Trelawney, \" be great danger in searching this house.\" \" Indeed ?\" Cried Lord Clackington, as he gave a sort of skip into the room, and turned com pletely round, as though he expected an attack from some quarter. \"Yes,\" added Trelawney ; \"but as you hava assistance at hand, they can conduct the search, while you and this gentleman with the one eye, may not object to sit down to supper with us.\" \" They come,\" said Trelawney. \" Let us ap pear to be quietly conversing, so that we may seem to be taken completely by surprise. I beg of you, then, with aU the gravity you can com mand, to play the parts I have assigned to you.\" \u2022\u2022 I will bo as grave as a judge,\" said the Marquis of Ormond. \" And I a great deal graver,\" added the Earl of Bridgewater. The supper looked tempting. The wine looked bright. Lork Clackington hesitated. \" I warn you, gentlemen,\" he said, \" that I am not a subject to play any tricks upon ; for what I am doing, and what I am about to do, 1 hold tho special warrant of the King.\""], [406, "EDITH HERON. 400 It was a kind of stillness, which seemed greatly to affect the nerves of Mr. Holt, fer he was of a decidedly social turn. \"We thought as much,\" said all the three gentlemen in chorus, and in very dismal tones. Lord Clackington and Mr. Holt whispered together, then, for a few seconds, after which the latter gave some directions to their myrmidons outside the door, and it was closed upon the party within. \"Our men will search the house,' said Lord Clackington, advancing to the supper table ; \" and since you are so hospitable, my lords, and you, Colonel Trelawney, wo will sit down at your supper table. Allow me to introduce Mr. Holt, a private friend of the King's.\" \"He is welcome to this sad repast,\" said Colonel Trelawney. Lord Clackington, too, looked uneasy. But Holt broke the silence. He had been a little shy at first, at setting down in such good company ; but now his na tural audacity began to show itself. \"Come, gentlemen,\" he cried, \"if we're to drink and be jolly, let us have no long faces.\" The Marquis of Ormond sighed deeply. The Earl of Bridgewater echoed the sigh. Colonel Trelawney leant his head upon his hand, and partially hid his face. \" Why, what's the matter, gentlemen ?\" added Holt ; \" any one would think you were at a funeral.\" \u2022' A funeral !\" added Colonel Trelawney, look ing up ; \" how suggestive !\" \" Sad repast !\" exclaimed Clackington, as he cast his eyes on the table. \" I don't see anything sad in it; it seems to me to be an excellent re past, and the wine looks positively tempting.\" \"Does it?\" said all tbe three gentlemen in chorus. \" Very !\" said the Marquis of Ormond. \" Very suggestive, indeed,\" added the Earl of Bridgewater. Then Lord ClacEngton, in a voice of some alarm, spoke. Lord ClackiDgton looked suspicious. He made a mental determination that nothing on earth should induce him to drink a single drop of that wine, unless he saw his entertainers do so likewise. \"What is the meaning of all this, my lords, and you, Colonel Trelawney,\" he asked. \" I should like to know the meaning of why 70U look so sombre, and speak in such melancholy tones?\" \u25a0\" Yes : the meaning, gentlemen T said Holt. Our stay here will be short, for our men wfll soon ransack the place.\" \" And I, for one,\" added Clackington, \" would rather have been with them.\" He gave Holt a slight touch on the arm. He whispered to him. \" Don't drink unless you see me do so !\" \" I won't !\" Colonel Trekjiwney, with studied courtesy, then took hold of the crystal flagon of Constan tia, and poured himself out a glass. He passed if to the Marquis of Ormond, who did the same. Then, Colonel Trelawney, after exchanging glances with the Marquis and the Earl, spoke in solemn tones. Then it reached the Earl of Bridgewater, who helped himself. \" At this awful juncture,\" be said, \" I think it is a duty which we owe to you both, to be quite confidential with you.\" \" Confidential? Awful juncture?\" cried Lord Clackington. \" What do you mean, sir?\" \"Yes,\" shouted Holt, \"what do you mean, sir?\" During all these operations, Lord Clackington kept his eyes eagerly fixed upon the flagon, and feeling perfectly satisfied that there could be no deception when it came round to him, be filled his glass. Holt did the same. But the resolve not to drink until he saw his entertainers do so likewise, was a fixed one in the mind of Lord Clackington. The Colonel waved his hand for silence. \" With what remaining strength and Use re mains to you,\" he said, \" I would advise you to listen. 1 and my two friends here are tired of the world. Circumstances have happened which induce us to desu. to leave it, and we had pitched upon this evening as that on which we intended to say fareweU to life.\" \"Say fareweU and be hanged to you !\" cried Holt. \" All I can say is, that I have no desire to accompany you.\" \" That is a pity,\" added Colonel Trelawney. \" A great pity,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater. \" A wonderful pity,\" said the Marquis of Or mond. Colonel Trelawney raised bis glass, and spoke in solemn tones. \" Let us hope, gentlemen, that there is an other and a better world.\" \" Amen 1\" said tbe Earl of Bridgewater. \" Amen !\" echoed the Marquis of Ormond. Each of them then drained his glass to the very dregs. \"Well, Gentlemen,\" said Lord Clackington, \" you are wonderfully solemn over a glass of wine. I drink to the King, and long Use to him !\" Clackington finished his glass, and Mr. Holt, seeing that he did so, considering that there was no longer any occasion to delay, tossed his off at once. \" Confound it, gentlemen ! What do you mean ?\" shouted Holt, as he sprung to his feet. \" My Lordpiackington, I don't Uke this; let us begone.\" Clackington looked nervous, glancing uneasily about him, and now and then letting his hand wander to his sword-hilt, as though he suspected there might be a sudden call upon him to defend himself. CHAPTER CCCXVII. LORD CLACKINGTON AND HIS FRIEND LEAVE CASTLENEAU HOUSE IN A VER* UNDIGNIFIED MANNER. \" You had better hear me out,\" said Colonel Trelawney, calmly. \" We have had long con sultation upon this subject \u2014 I mean myseU and There was a very awful stillness in tbat ancient but costly breakfast-parlour at Castleneau House."], [407, "SDITH HHE0X. 401 my two friends here \u2014 and we have come to a 1 conclusion that life is a worthless possession.\" He sat down instantly in the chair from whicn. he had risen, and, flinging himself backward, he overbalanced it, rolling over completely with it in a mass of confusion. \" Cast it away yourselves, then, gentlemen,\" cried Clackington ; \" nobody hinders you ; but do not trouble mo with your absurd fancies, for I am of a different opinion.\" , \" That is a pity,\" said all the three gentleman in chorus. \"Poisoned!\" bellowed Holt \u2014 \"poisoned! I never thought of that ! The only fate that ever presented itseU to me was that of being hanged ; and I knew that I had sufficient knowledge of the law to keep me out of that scrape ! But to be poisoned \u2014 poisoned Uke a rat ! Help, help Murder !\" \" Because,\" added Colonel Trelawney, as he pointed to the decanter of wine, from which the glasses rotnd had been taken \u2014 \"because we thought that would be the most ready way of ending our human miseries.\" \" What ?\" \" You exhaust, by making that outcry,\" said Colonel Trelawney, \" the Uttle strength that re mains to you.\" \"Little strength?\" \" Yes ; in ten minutes you wfll be a dead man, as, indeed, we shaU all be dead men !\" \"That!\" \" That wine ? You do not mean to say, Colonel Trelawney? \u2014 You cannot mean to say that that wine is \u2014 is \" \" Help, help ! Murder ! A physician ! A dozen doctors, if necessary ! Help!

No. 103.\u2014 Edith Heron."], [408, "EDITH HERON. 402 countering the prostrate form of Lord Clacking ton, he fell completely over him, bringing his head with such force against the floor, that he lay in a state of semi-insensibility. The door of the room was at that moment flung open, for the outcry that Holt had made reached the ears of the men who had been search ing Castleneau House. \" Yes. He calls himself Mortification Ripon. ' \" I know the man weU, and wiU see him.\" \" Is it quite safe and wise to do so?\" asked Lady Castleneau. \" I think so. I don't think Mortification would do anything to bring danger to me. Show him into the little parlour by the side of the haU, Anthony, and I will come to him.\" In a few minutes, Heron walked into the room where Mortification was waiting, and as he did so, he spoke in his own undisguised voice. \" Mortification, I trust you. I am here, a3 you surmised, and as you now see.\" \" Yea, as the psalmist says.\" \" Hold ! Speak like a rational being, and tell me what is your business !\" \" Jonathan Wild \" \" Wild ! Can it be possible you bring me a message from him ?\" \" Yea, and I do ; and wfll take one back : for, as the psalmist truly observes, ' those who fetch can carry,' and, further on, he Ukewise re marketh \" \" What's the matter ?\" they cried in a breath. \"Nothing,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater; * only these gentlemen have been taking a glass of wine too much.\" The constables laughed. \" Have you found those for whom you came to search ?\" asked Trelawney. \u00bb \" No, sir,\" replied one of the men ; \" and I'U take upon myself to say, that we have been in every room in the house.\" \" Then, take away your two principals here, for we have had enough of their company.\" The abject state of terror into which Lord Clackington and Mr. Holt bad been thrown, pre vented them even from making the least effort to set themselves right in the eyes of their myr midons. \" Peace ! peace ! Speak plainly at once ! What does Wild want with me ?\" Already they felt, in imagination, the poison curling in tbeir veins. \" Yea, he Uketh not to be hanged.\" \"Is that news ? And can I save him ?\" \" Listen, and I will relate what he sayeth ! He sent for me even unto his ceU at Newgate, and ' Mortification,' said he ; ' yea, Mr. WUd V' said I ; ' Mortification Ripon,' said he ; ' yea, Jonathan Wild,' said I \" \" Now, hear me for one moment,\" interrupted Felix Heron. \" You can be rational when you like ; and if you do not teU me, in two minutes. what you want with me, or what Wild has sent you to say, you shaU go at once, and I wUl not hear another word you utter.\" \" Jonathan WUd don't Uke to be hanged, and if he can't get a reprieve, he wants a dose of laudanum, which will put him out of the world, and cheat the gallows.\" Mortification uttered all this in a breath. And, as they might weU believe, that death by such means must produce a certain amount of prostration, tbeir fears had a similar effect. Perhaps the fall they both had likewise aided materially in convincing them that they were near death's door. ' Certain it is, that they lay completely prostrate, and only by low groans signified that they were stUl in existence. Their men lifted them from tbe floor. Whatever reverence they may have had for them, as their employers, completely vanished. My Lord Clackington, and Mr. Holt, the legal adviser of tbe king, were, therefore, carried from Castleneau House in the most undignified man ner possible. \" That is well done !\" cried Trelawney, \" and I very much doubt whether either one of those rascals wiU recover the shock of fear they have experienced for some days.\" \" That time,\" said the Earl of Bridgewater, \" will be amply sufficient to place Whitcombe in perfect safety.\" Lady Castleneau at this moment stepped into the room, for she had watched from a window, the officers leavo the house. \" That is explicit,\" said Heron, as he paced the room to and fro. \"Yea, as the psalmist \" \" Silence !\" Mortification nearly fell down, so sharply and abruptly did Felix Heron speak. \" Silence ! and answer the questions I put to you.\" \" Yea.\" \"Did Wild send you to me with this re quest ?\" \" Nay.\" \" Then, why did you come ?\" \" Because the chemist won't sell me the poi son. I said it was to kill rats, but they laughed at me, aud wanted to know the name of the rat.\" \" No !\" she said, \" There's no place so safe as this, and, with my consent, neither Felix nor Edith shall leave it, until they can both go forth alone at noon-day into the streets of the city with perfect safety.\" A loud ring at. the gate bell of Castleneau House now announced an arrival, and by the time Heron aud Edith had again reached the breakfast-room, old Anthony made his ap pearance, with a puzzled look. \"You seek me,\" said Heron, as he saw that the old servitor's eyes were fixed upon him. \" Yes, my lord !\" Anthony was now very particular always to give Heron his title. \" I comprehend,\" said Heron. \" You would have done this for Jonathan Wild, if it were in your power ; but you have failed, and now you come to me to help you ?\" \"Yea.\" \" Let me think.\" Heron sat down, and rested his head upon his hands, while Mortification went on speaking. \" It is not altogether death that Jonathan Wild dreads ; it is not altogether the parting with his life, nor is it pain, or any particular fancy for one \"What is it?\" \" A person has asked for yon \\ij name.\" \" Indeed ! Then, did ho gi \u2022, o his own ?\""], [409, "403 EDITH HERON. I I mode over another of quitting this world; but he has many enemies, and his name is a terror aud a reproach.

And those fetters had bebnaitbe .only meaMs of preventing him from making- s_m_,daring effort at escape. \" Because of late years I have sunk so low that I must forget what I once was.

Heron tore a leaf from his pocket-book. He wrote upon it, in the systematic manner of medical men the name of the drug that Wild required. But for those, he must, and would, in all pro bability, have succeeded in getting out of -.New gate. And now they pressed heavily\"\u00abpon his limbs, and he felt how futile was toy attempt to ' dis embarrass himself of them.

Suddenly he looked up. ...,'. \"I wonder if they have cleared out .Little Newgate ?\" he said. \"It don't matter to we much now whether they discovers ..ailiSa secrets or not.\" Mortification stalked out of the room, and descending the steps of Castleneau House, he crossed the courtyard, looking more tall, gaunt, aud ungainly than ever. But as Felix Heron looked after him he, for the first time, respected the man whom he had known so long, and who, on that occasion, seemed to have come out in a completely new and im proved character. \u2022\u25a0 How strangely we mistake people,\" said Heron. \" This poor grotesque Mortification Eipon is something very different from what he seemed, and even at the bottom of the heart of Jonathan Wild, I havo reason to know there lie some humane and kindly sympathies.

The warder left the cell, and Wild was once The three bolts wore withdrawn, one by one, and with great deliberation. A key was turned in the ponderous lock, and the cell door oreaked open. The Sheriff entered, attended by two warders. \" Well, Mr. Wild,\" he said, \" I hope that every thing has been done to make your short stay here as comfortable as possible. I have no desire to trample on the fallen.\" \" Sh'?\" said WUd. \" I _say, I hope everything has been done to make your short stay in this prison as comfort able as circumstances will allow of.\" The look that came over Jonathan Wild's face, now, was truly horrible. more alone, a prey to his 0 wn sad reflections. \"Yes,\" he murmured to himself; \"forsaken by all, and yet \u2014 and yet I did not think he would have, res used my last request, but it doesn't signify. I'll try to nerve myself for to-morrow. I wonder what time it is.\" Wild threw himself upon the rough bench which served for day and night accommodation, aad fell into a doze. It was past eleven o'clock at night, when he was aroused by the rattle of the key in the door of his ceU. \"Who are you?\" he gasped. \" One of the Sheriffs.\" \" Then you have come to say that the Secretary of State, wfll-?\u2014\" \" No, Mr. Wild\u2014 it is much better for you at once to disabuse your mind of any idea of a reprieve. \" Your doom is, I regret to say, fixed ; and if you are a wise man, you will spend the short time you have to live, in trying to make amends for much of the mischief you have done in this world.\" \" Ah ! another visit from tbe Sheriff, I suppose, or the Governor, or \" Wild paused, for at this moment, his eyes fell upon the tall form of Mortification Ripon, who, with his fingers interlaced upon the breast of bis closely buttoned-up coat, looked like a walking automaton. \" Oh !\" said Wild, \" so you've come at last.\" \" Yea, verily,\" responded Mortification, with out stirring so much as a finger. \" WeU, and have you brought what I asked for?\" Wild's face tprned deadly pale. \" You don't mean that,\" he said. \" I do \u2014 indeed, I do ! \" repUed the Sheriff, gently. \" Then may curses loud and deep be upon your head ; and from this time I wiU not speak a word to any of you.\" \" As you please.\" The Sheriff, without betraying the slightest trace of irritation at the anger of the prisoner, turned upon bis heel and left the cell. Wild was now without hope. Tyburn tree presented itseU to his mind in all its horrors. He groaned and tossed himself about on the ground, and cast the most horrible imprecations against all and every one that he considered had had anything to do with bringing him to such a condition as he was now in. \" Yea, verily.\" \" Give it to me, then,\" said Wild, a gleam of gratification lighting up his pale haggard face. \" Give it me, then, or it may be too late.\" Mortification looked at him steadily. \" And do you really mean to take this subtle poison ?\" \" Mean to take it ? Do you think I'm such a coward as you ? Of course, I mean to take it. Give it me, I say !\" Mortification produced from a pocket in his coat a small phial, and presented it to WUd, saying as' he did so, \" I should have been here before, but they would not sell it to me.\" \u2022 \" Then how did you succeed in getting it,\" ' asked Wild, excitedly. \" I was obliged to go to some one else.\" \" Ah ! Then it is known that I have such a thing in my possession. Fool !\" Hour after hour came aud went, and still Mor tification did not appear, i \" Oh, that I had him here,\" growled Wild. \" Was it too great a favour to ask just a couple of ounces of laudanum, that would have, at aU events, spared me some of the horrors of my situation? Ah! what's that?\" \" Not such a fool as I look, friend, or I should not have been here to-night.\" . \" But I bound you over to secresy !\" \" So long as I kept it a secret, I could do nothing. But when I went to FeUx Heron, as he nameth himself, aU was plain sailing, as the psalmist says.\" \" FeUx Heron ! and did he do this for me ?\" As Jonathan Wild listened, he heard footsteps approaching his cell; and in another minute, a warder entered the ceU. Jonathan Wild looked up. , \" Well, have you sent to my son ?\" \" Yes, Mr. Wild.\" \" What did he say, then ? Speak ! When is he coming ?\" The man shook his head. \" Verily, he did.\" \" What said he ?\" asked Wild. \" At first he seemed disinclined to become ac cessory to the fact, but afterwards he took a better thought of it\", and wrote upon a sUp of paper some heathenish signs ; and, behold, when I presented it at the first chemist's shop I came to, they were most polite, and only anxious to know when I should want some more.\" \" Are you dumb, or a fool, that you can't open your mouth ?\" roared Wild almost beside him self- \" Tell me, when is he coming to see his father for the last time ? Perhaps, he is here ?\" \" No, Mr. Wild, he isn't here ; and he said that, as he was neither a parson, nor a lawyer, nor a hangman, he could be of no use.\" Wild dropped his face upon his hands, and was silent for some minutes. \" It is well,\" said Wild, in a low voice. \" I am glad now that I befriended those who are so dear to him.\" * \"Now, sir,\" said the warder, \"time's up\u00bb if you please.\" \" I come \u2014 verily, I come !

I would fain comfort you if I could, but I know not what to say.\" There was something in Mortification's tone that seemed to touch the better feelings of Wild, for as the former was about to leave the cell, he held out his hand, saying, \" Good bye, Mortifica tion Ripon ! We shall never meet again.\" Mortification took Jonathan Wild's hand in both of his, and said, huskily, \" Farewell ! I am glad I have seen you again, and seen you thus. Farewell ! I can do nothing more ?\" \" Nothing,\" said Wild, in the same tone. The door of the cell closed upon the tall, un gainly form of Mortification ; and once more Jonathan Wild felt that he was alone, in the full sense of that heart-crushing word. Perhaps alone for ever ! And better so, than to come into contact with his fellow men again, knowing that they thirsted for his death. \" Hurrah ! That's the proper thing, Mr. Wild! Keep up your spirits !\" \" What's o'clock ?\" \"Listen!\" St.. Paul's chimed the quarter past twelve. \" I'm ready, then,\" said Wild ; \"but I think the Governor might rid me of these shackles.\" \" No, no, Mr. Wild, that can't? bo done till you set out in the morning ; but_ I promise you one thing.\" \" What is that ?\" \" They shall never be worn by any one else, but shaU be hung up in the vestibule of Newgate,. and they shall be caUed \" Jonathan Wild's fet ters.\" \" Bah !\" said Wild. \" There's a honour for a man !\" exclaimed an other of the warders. I'd almost be hanged my self to be handed down to prosperity in such a manner !\" \"Trash! trash!\" cried Wild. \"If we're to have supper, let's have it ; and he who drinks deepest shall be the jolliest- dog among us ! I can take it at any time.\" ' WUd uttered these last .vords in a low tone to himseU ; and tbey were in aUusion to tbe killing dose of laudanum which he had in his pocket. The \" Uttle crib,\" as it was called in Newgate, was a stone-vaulted room on the ground floor that is, on a level with the prison hall. Wild took the phial containing the laudanum again from his pocket. He looked wistfully at it. \" It is but a sleep,\" he said ; \" a feeUng of drowsiness, first ; perhaps, then, a slight nausea, for I have heard as much ; then a stupor, and a long sleep which knows no awaking. Shall I take it now ?\" Wild placed his hand on the cork of the phial. \" ShaU I take it now?\" he repeated. He slowly twisted the cork round, and it made a Btrange, squeaking noise. Wild started. It had no windows in it whatever, nor any fireplace. Its ventilation, therefore, was very bad, and its Ught none. Then he listened intently, for he heard a rush of many footsteps 'approaching the cell. He had just time to conceal phial again, when the door was flung open, and four or five of the warders of NeWgate appeared. \"Come, Mr. Wild,\" ; cried .one, \"a short life and a merry one ! We can have supper as usual in the Uttle crib.\" Wild knew perfectly well what this invitation meant. In day-time there generally' flared from its smoky ceiling a lamp, burning such indifferent oil that its odour was by far plainly distin, guishable. In this somewhat noisome place, a sturdy deai table, some twelve or fourteen feet in length, was provided with bottles; glasses, pipes, and to bacco. It was a ghastly piece of -nieWiment. But it was the custom of all the warders and turnkeys off duty to hold this carouse With the condemned man, and many were the tales told of murder and rapine by the various criminals who', in a few short hours, would expiate their crimes upon a scaffold. A man condemned to death at that period, after twelve o'clock on the night preceding his execution, was generally treated to a carouse in Newgate. ' In fact, the scandalous practice, which was ac companied by a great scene of inebriety and up roar, was continued for some years later than the date of our story. It was not at aU unusual for these orgies to last until the break of day ; and the wretched con der^-ied man would frequently be taken to Ty burn with his brain in such a state of confusion from the wild uproar and hard drinking of the preceding night, that, as was remarked by a writer of the period, he could hardly have told whether he were going to be hanged or mar ried. \"Now, Mr. Wild,\" cried one; \" what would you Uke to begin with ?\" '\u2022' ' \" Burnt brandy !\" cried Wild. \" I'm as dry as dust!\" His favourite liquor Was served to him, and he drank at first as much as 'would, havo confused the faculties of any ordinary man. The turnkey were not behindhand in partak ing of the ardent spirits with which tho table was crowded ; and for several hours an awful tumult raged in the \" Uttle crib,\" which, as it was the result of an ancient custom, -., as not in terfered with. Wild hesitated a few seconds.

The executioner dodged th\u00c6 missile, and a roar of laughter from the wardens and turnkeys tes tified to their appreciation of what they thought v.rts- a eajtttal joke. \u2022\u25a0 Come,\" added Wild ; \"wifl any one take my wage* .j} . I will give long odds !\" '\u25a0 It's no use, Mr. Wild ! Hark !\" There was a rattlff of carriage wheels in the OW: Bailey. f ' It's the sheriff !\" said cone, as he rose. \" So soon ?\" cried Wild. \u2022 We shall see. Mr. Morgan, of Newgate Street, the surgeon of the prison, was immediately sent for, and arrived in hot haste to give his services. Those services were not for the purpose of preserving life, but to keep the breath of exis tence in the dilapidated frame of Jonathan Wild, in order tbat it might be violently wrenched from him. \" And thne enough, too,\" said -Qie chief turn key. \" Don't you know the time's altered from twelve to ten,' now ? You Bee, all the roughs about the' Fleet's valley, at1 twelve o'clock, whioh ilsdd to b$ the old time, had their dinner hour ; but at ten they are hard at work, and the Tyburn cart can Jog on its way without their company.\" I 'S.I hadf or gotten,'-' said Wild. \" Good morn ing !\" As he spoke, he took the little phial of lau danum strom Ms poeket, and, with one sharp blow upon the edge of the table, dashing off its neck, he placed it to his lips, and drained the contents to its very dregs. But that Is the policy of the law. It is not a policy that we quarrel with, although in this especial case, perhaps, we should be glad to see that the great thief-taker had cheated the gallows. \" Ah !\" cried Mr. Morgan, as he opened one of Wild's eyes, \" I see ; he has had a dose of laudanum, Uke JCrry of the Mint last year, who was hanged for coining.\" Some of the higher officials of the prison had now made their way into the \"little crib.\" And although there was no window in that wretched stone-vaulted apartment, a soft gray gleam of daylight made its way through the open door. \"What's to be done, Mr. Morgan?\" said the Sheriff. CHAPTER CCCXIS, THE RIDE TO TYBURN. \u2014 THE EXECUTIONER TF4ES TO MAKE PEACE WITH THE MOB. There was -nor- concealment about what Wild had done. \" Get a couple of men to walk him up and down the prison-yard, and don't let him stand still for a moment.\" He sprung to his feet on the instant. His countenance presented an awful spec tacle. The consciousness, which was strong in his own mind, that all hope was now over, and that he had taken- the fatal leap \u2014 so to speak \u2014 from life to death, entirely changed the ordinary ap pearance of WUd's face. He became perfeotly white, and then of a strange livid colour, whioh was something ter rific to see. The warders and turnkeys rose in alarm. \" He has done it at last,\" cried one ; \" Mr. Wild has poisoned hh__s_lf.J' ; '\u25a0 He's done it at last!\" exolaimed Wild, as he Bunk back on the chair again, with tho fetters f-till about him\u2014 coming down upon the chair with a clash of cold iron-; and there he lay hud dled up, as though that weight of manaoles only clung to the limbs of a corps?. \" Help, help'! Mrs Wild has poisoned himself ! Help, help! Cold water! Hot water ! A doc- \" All right, Mr. Morgan !\" cried the chief turnkey. \" Now, Mr. Wild, if you please, come along !\" Wild looked vacantly about him. \"If he keep his eyes shut more than two minutes at a time,\" added the surgeon, \"dash some cold water over his head and face.\" \" But what is to be done ?\" cried the Sheriff, as he took an enormous watch from his pocket. \"Yes,\" added the Governor of Newgate, \" what's to be done ?\" \" Time is short,\" continued the Sheriff. \" AU I can say,\" replied Mr. Morgan, \"is just this, that if you want to hang Jonathan Wild, you had better look sharp about it.\" \" We wiU start at once !\" cried the Sheriff. \" See that aU is ready !\" \" I'll see to that !\" cried the hangman ; \" and will undertake that in twenty minutes, Mr. Sheriff, everything shall be ready for a start.\" During that twenty minutes, Jonathan Wild was hunted to and fro in the yard of Newate,"], [413, "EDITH HERON. 407 and a plentiful supply of cold water was drenched upon his head and face. He did not go to sleep. The dose of laudanum was either really in sufficient in consequence of adulteration at the chemist's where it had been purchased, or tho strong stimulants which Jonathan Wild had par taken of during the night had weakened its in fluence. procession to Tyburn, that was to convey Jonathan. Wild to death, was fairly arranged for starting. And the impression was strong on the part of the mob of the intention on the part of the authorities to save him, that they formed them selves into a compact mass around the death cart, and uttered the most fearful yells and execrations. It was certainly not enough to kill him. Not enough to throw him even into a trance, which should make him oblivious of surround ing objects and occurrences. Then the Sheriff's carriage drove out of the yard of Newgate. The Sheriff was to precede the prisoner to Tyburn, thus practically conducting him to death, according to the terms of the warrant. But Wild had not yet appeared himself, and the mob still believed tbat they might be jilted in some way. The shouts and yeUs were something fearful to hear. But he was not quite himself. There was a half-dreamy look about his eyes, and now and then he gazed in some familiar face without betraviug any signs of recognizing it. So far, then, the real pang of death to Jona than Wild seemed to have passed away. He was alive enough- to be taken to execu tion. They penetrated the stone walls of Newgate. They reached the deafest ears that were in that gloomy region. A nd those ea*s were Jonathan Wild's at that moment. But he was scarcely alive enough to be fully cognisant of the fact. The twenty minutes had expired, and the hangman was as good, or we might almost say as bad, as his word. He looked up, and muttered something. But no one could make articulate sounds of what he said. The death cart was at the door of Newgate. A roughly-put-together coffin, smeared with black rather than painted that colour, was at the bottom of the cart. \" We had better move on,\" said the hangman. \" The Reverend Ordinary is in the cart.\" \" Go, then,\" said the Sheriff, \" and be quick about it.\" The Reverend Ordinaiy of Newgate got into tbe vehicle. \" Let Mr. Wild go first, sir, if you please. If the people see me without him, they wiU stone me.\" One of the warders mounted the horse that drew it, like a postilion. \" Very well ; then let him go first, but be quick.\" A couple of warders led Wild out. The roaring shout that came now from the thousands assembled in the Old Bailey, made even the warders recoil, and for a moment, weak and half dead as he was, Wild stood alone. From one of the inn yards opposite, there issued a compact body of mounted constables, some twenty in number. They were aU weU armed with hangers and pistols. The hour was unusually early for anything of this nature to take place in or about Newgate. But the numerous idlers who are always about that part of the town, in consequence of the contiguity of the two great markets, Smithfield and Newgate, soon saw what was going on. The alarm was spread over the whole neigh bourhood. Then he seemed to be aware of what was going on, and he glared at the mob with hatred and contempt. He said something which was of course com pletely drowned in the general uproar of sounds. \" Now, Mr. Wild,\" said one of the warders, \" get in, and be quick.\" \" Yes,\" said the other ; \"if Ve aU of us get to Tyburn in whole skins, we shall be lucky fellows!\" Down by Fleet Market, Ukewise, and aU the purUeus of Holborn Bridge. And this alarm took a pecuUar character. A character that was quite a mistake on the part of the people. Wild was helped into the cart. He sat down on the coffin ; not knowing what it was. It was to the effect that the authorities had made up their minds to save Jonathan Wild from the death at the gaUows he so richly merited, and were taking him out of Newgate at this unusually early hour for the express purpose of permitting him to escape. Such a report as this spread with the rapidity of lightning over the entire neighbourhood. From the shambles of Newgate Market. From all those mysterious and noisome re cesses in and about Smithfield. From the valley of the Fleet, where there was such a colony of thieves that it took something more than the succeeding century to rout them out, there came swarms of people. With that incredible celerity with which London mobs assemble, the Old Bailey bad three or four thousand persons within it before the The hangman then appeared, and got in by the side of Jonathan. And so great an object of popular dislike and contumely was that last finisher of the law, that for a moment Jonathan Wild was forgotten. The usual yells with which the executioner was greeted came from every throat. It was customary then for the hangman to stand up in the cart and take off the red night cap he wore, making a low bow to the people. This was to deprecate the ill-feeling they had towards him. It was as much as to say, \" I know I am in your bad graces, but I am here to do my duty \u2014 despicable as that duty is, bo I trust that you wfll let me alone.\" The hangman went through all this kind of"], [414, ".qo EDITH HERON. : \u2014 . ; ' _,\u201e* then crouched down in a corner I Then the Sheriff got out, and, with a great ft tri,' :f fS^tenttom Jonathan Wild deal more courage than was to be ex ted from of the cart, as far distant from Jonatnan wna and the Reverend Ordinary of Newgate as he could get. _ The Sheriff's carnage started. It was with great difficulty it got through the crowd. Indeed, if one half of the mounted officers had not preceded it and made rather a liberal use of the flats of their hangers, it would have been impossible to make a passage. The other officers surrounded the cart. And so, in a few moments, the death cortege was fully in motion. First the officers. him, he mounted the box of his own carriage, and from an elevated position, he spoke to the people. \" If another stone is thrown, I wfll read the Riot Act, which I have here in my pocket ; and immediately after that, I wiU order the consta bles to fire upon the people, for we wfll not be pelted and injured because we are doing our duty in conveying a great criminal to justice, and to the fate he deserves !\" There is nothing like courage with a crowd. The demeanour of the Sheriff was aU that could be desired. Not another stone was thrown. He got into his carriage again, and the proces sion wound slowly up Holborn HU1. At the corner of Hatton Garden, a strange, frantic-looking woman, with a child in her arms, rushed forward, and held up the infant towards the death cart. \"Look! look!\" she cried. \"Look at the murderer of your father ! There is the wretch who swore away your father's life last sessions ! Look at him, and curse him, infant as you are !\" \u25a0 Then the Sheriff's carriage. Then the cart with its escort. Lastly, the Governor of Newgate, and one of its chief warders \u2014 both on horseback. The crush of people about the corner by St. Sepulchre's church was tremendous. Looking down Snow Hill, towards the valley of the Fleet, the sight was at onee grand and fearful. The whole route seemed a perfect sea of human heads and faces. And all the windows of the houses, too, on each side of the way, were thrown open and crowded with curious gazers. So rapidly collected a vast throng of people had surely never been seen in aU London. Step by step, as slowly as foot could saU, the mounted officers had to clear the way. The noise was prodigious, for almost every person in that dense throng had something to yell out to Jonathan Wild. And in this manner the valley of the Fleet was gained. The rush of people from Fleet Market and Blaekfr iars to the left, and from Field Lane, and aU its pestiferous courts and alleys to the right, was fearful. The death procession came to a standstill. It seemed impossible that it should-ever get past the dead lock that ensued at that spot. The Sheriff put his head out of the carriage window. \" Officers !\" he cried, \" you must really clear the way, or we shall be here all day !\" \" We can't, your worship !\" \" I will get out and read Jae Riot Act, if there is any further obstruction.\" The officers bad aU their drawn hangers in their hands, and now they began to make a somewhat dangerous use of them among the foremost of the people. The route was partially cleared, but a new peri] quickly arose. The open yard in front of St. Andrew's Church happened to be undergoing some repairs, and a quantity of stones aud broken bricks were there collected. The mob made way for this frantic woman- She reached the side of the death cart. She clung to it with one hand, and holding up the child with the other, she screamed reproachfully at Jonathan Wild. 1 \" Wretch ! wretch ! Take my malediction with you ! You are going to death yourself now, as you sent my husband, and the father of my child! Wretch! wretch! Look at me and hear me!\" Wild did look at her. But it was with no sort of intelligence. His brain was evidently in too confused a con dition to make him at aU conscious of what this woman was saying to him. woman was saying 10 mm. For aU he knew, she might be showering blessings down upon his head. \" There ! there !\" said the Roverend Ordinary ; \" Go away, that is enough !\" \" It is not enough ! I want him to know me ! Jonathan Wild! Jonathan Wild! look at me, and know me !\" But the officers would tolerate it no longer. The woman was thrust aside, yeUing and screaming, among the crowd, and the death procession went on its way. 1 CHAPTER CCCXX. THE LAST MOMEKTS OF J0NAT1L\\N WELD. And now, if Jonathan Wild had had a hundred enemies for one, and if they had all met on that occasion, to utter yells of vengeance in his ears, and exult in his downfaU, they might have done so with impunity, so far as he was con cerned, and wasted their broath in vain. He sat perfectly still. He neither looked to the right nor the left And although the sun ewas shining, and many persons had to hold their hands up before their eyes: to keep off its most refulgent beimi, A boy set the example, Which was quiokly followed by hundreds of the crowd.

I It was the shadow of death It was something more than doubtful that, that funeral cortege, as it might be called, would ever reach Tyburn Tree with the victim of the day. The clergyman had made several efforts to attract Jonathan Wild's attention; but seeing that they were aU in vain, he contented himself by reading, quietly, some ordinary prayer for the dying. And now the cart was near the Oxford Road. So near, that the only district that had to be passed through before taking the abrupt turn to the left, which would conduct it in a straight line to Tyburn, was St. Giles's. There it was customary to halt for a few mi nutes, while a tankard of any Uquor the criminal might choose to name was brought out of a weU-known public hous\u00ab for him to jpartake cf.

'\u2022 It is a dreadful thing to take a man to death in suoh * state 1\""], [416, "410 EDITH HERON. fences upon my head, than I would be that son.\" The officer shrugged his shoulders. \"Perhaps, it is,\" he said, \" but still a lucky thing for him, since he will go out of the world without hardly knowing by what means.\" \" I'U take something to drink, if you please,\" said the hangman, \" for it's dusty work !\" \" Com?, Mr. Wild !\" cried a rolbcking, cheerful voice, at this moment. \" I always said that if you came this way in a cart, you should have the best drop of Uquor my house afforded.\" The landlord of the public-house held up a large tankard containing some enticing compound well spiced and hot. \" Try him with it,\" said the officer. \" It's of no use,\" said the hangman. As he spoke, he stretched out his own hand to take the tankard. The procession passed on. Up the Oxford Road, then quite a rural spot, with fields stretching far away to the right hand, although tbe line of houses on the left was quite continuous to Hyde Park Corner. And about half-way up that Oxford Road, a very curious scene presented itself. The whole of the immense mob that had pre ceded and followed the death procession of Jo nathan Wild, set off at a hard race, one person with another to Tyburn. The object of each was to secure a good place close to the scaffold. , The effect of this movement was to leave the cart, and the constables who guarded it, almost alone. \"No, no,\" said the landlord, \"it's for Jonathan Wild, and no Jack Ketch's lips shall touch the rim of this tankard if /I know it.\" They closed round their charge, for it was well-known that on similar occasions, daring at tempts to escape had been made, and they were determined that such should not happen to Jo nathan Wild. \u2022 The mounted officer took the Uquor in his hand, and held it to. the lips of Jonathan Wild. Sufficient life yet lingered in the frame of the condemned man to make him understand that there was something to drink. A quarter of an hour more, and Tyburn was reached. The habit of so many years asserted its su premacy, e yen in those last few minutes of his life. A roaring shout arose from the people then, a; the cart containing the \u25a0victim of the day, slowly wound its way through the dense mass of per sons there assembled. WUd drank from cue tankard. \" That's right !\" cried the landlord, \" I should have been very much disappointed if you bad not taken some.\" It was seen, then, that the executioner was holding up Jonathan WUd as he sat upon the coffin. Wild drank again. \" That's better still, and now go your way, and good luck to you ! I know you're a bad one, but if you were ten times worse then you are, what more could you do than go and be hanged for it, so that puts everything square.\" \"It does, indeed,\" said the mounted .officer. \" Let's proceed.\" The hot strong liquor seemed to mount to the brain of Jonathan Wild. The Chaplain had closed his book, and .then beckoned to the chief officer of the escort \" The man is dead,\" he said. \" So I thought !\" repUed the officer; \"by his looks.\" '\u2022 We had hotter return !\" \" I think not, the people will be furious. It will be far better to hang him dead or alive.\" \" Hats off! hats off!\" was theory from mouth to mouth. The shadow partly lifted from his face, and he looked about him as if beginning to comprehend what was happening and where he was. The Ordinary thought it was a good oppor tunity of putting in a word. \" Unhappy man,\" he said, \" while life remains to you, lot me hear from your lips some words of repentance and hope in the world to come.\" Wild spoke. The words he uttered sounded strangely to the ears of all who heard them, and they knew not what to make of them. Every head was uncovered. The cart drove under the fatal beam. The hangman adjusted the rope, and in half a minute more, all that remained of Jonathan Wild, the famous thief-taker, and the hero cf a thousand strange adventures, was a long, limp, dangUng corpse. \" It is over,\" said Felix Heron, as with his riding whip in his hand, he walked into the breakfast-room of Castleneau House. \" It is over, and Jonathan Wild is no more.\" \" I am neither a parson, nor a lawyer, nor a hangman, and therefore I can be of no servico to him.\" \" Heaven grant him pardon and peace !\" said Edith. \" Amen !\" replied Heron, as he placed his hat upon a chair. \" I saw the whole affair from the high ground a little way up the Edgeware Road.\" \" What does he mean,\" said the landlord of the public-house. Everybody shook their heads. Another of the mounted escort, however, who had approached the cart, turned to the chief officer, saying, \"Don't you recoUect, sir, that was the precise message that Jonathan Wild's blackguard son sent to him when he was asked to come to Newgate and see his condemned father.\" \" Was there a scene at the execution ?\" asked Lady Castleneau. \" I think not, ail seemed decorous and still, but Tom Ripon knows more about it than I, for he said that if they hung him for doing so, he would see the last of Jonathan Wild, and be close to the scaffold.\" \" Is that possible,\" said the Chaplain. \" Yes, I heard the message myself.\" \" Then I would rather be this poor, wretched Jonathan Wild taken to death, with aU his of- A tap came on the panel of the breakfast-room door. \"That is Tom,\" said Edith. \" Come ih,\" said Heron, \" and tell us how it"], [417, "EDITH HERON. 411 was that Jonathan Wild came to reach Tyburn at all to-day.\" Heron, in his own mind alluded to the pre scription he had given to 11. -tification for the laudanum, which he thought would have been quite sufficient to put an end to tbe Tyburn ex hibition on tbat occasion. \" It is a coach, Captain ! Ah, now I see, it is the Earl of Bridgewater and our other friends.\" Heron smiled at the terms in which Tom spoke of the titled party who had arrived at Castleneau House. \" Show them in \u2014 show them in at once, Tom,\" he cried ; \" they may, perhaps, bring us news of some importance.\" The Earl of Bridgewater and his friends, the Marquis of Ormond, and Colonel Trelawney, soon made their appearance. The Earl had an open letter in his hand. \" This comes,\" he said, \" from Colonel Gran viUe, who is equerry to Prince George. Read it, Whitcombe, and decide at once what is best to be done.\" \" I saw it all,\" said Tom. \" Did he speak ?\" \" He couldn't, he wasn't hanged.\" \"Not hanged?\" \" Bless you, no, Captain ! He was dead before they tucked him up ; so I don't call that hang ing a fellow at all.\" \" I expected as much,\" said Heron ; \" and, at all events, if he were not dead, utterly and en tirely, he has escaped the principal pang of death, which lies in its expectation.\" Up to that time, FeUx Heron had not thought it right to communicate, even to Edith, the perilous secret connected with Jonathan Wild's attempt to commit suicide in Newgate. Heron took the letter and read as follows: \u2014 \" Warwick House. \" Mr Dear Bridgewater, \" His Highness the Prince this morning had evidently something he wished to communi cate to me, but which twenty times he seemed to hesitate to utter. Perhaps he did not feel satisfied be had done right in the assistance he had given to Mortifica tion Ripon, as regarded the mode of procuring the poisonous draught. But now tbat Jonathan Wild was indeed no more\u2014 either by bis own hands, or by those of the executioner, \u2014 he beckoned Edith and Lady Castleneau into the recess of one of the huge bay windows of the breakfast-room. \" At length, as he walked up and down the room in which we were sitting conversing, I learnt, rather from what he muttered to himself than from what he told me, the following intelligence : \u2014 \" The King does not feel well and has shut himself up in his private apartments at Kea.- Bington Palace. \" It must be a secret no longer,\" he said, \"that I was sufficiently grateful to Jonathan Wild for the protection he was willing to accord to you, Edith, when he thought me no more, to assist him in cheating the gallows.\" \" The only persons he would allow to see him are those two infamous persons, Holt, and my Lord Clackington. \"Private orders are sent to Colonel Ransom of the Light Horse, to assist the civil power in completely investing a certain mansion in Bloomsbury fields, so that if there are any friends of yours there, who do not want to be incon venienced, it is well for you to know. A word to the wise, from \" How so?\" asked Edith. \" I helped him to the means of a better and calmer death.\" \" You were right, Felix \u2014 you were right,\" said Edith. Lady Castleneau shook her head. \" No, my dear Edith, he was not right, but, on the contrary very wrong ; but yet there are some wrong things we would rather see done than right ones, and I am not prepared to say that this is not one of them.\" \u2022' Yours sincerely, u Philld? Granville.\" Heron turned to the Earl of Bridgewater. \" This indeed is worth knowing,\" he said. \" It is but \u2014 \" Edith drew a long breath. She leant upon the arm of Felix Heron, and looked up in his face. \" You would speak, Edith , what is it you would say ? \" \" Felix, we are at peace.\" \" Peace ? you and I, Edith ? Good heavens, what mean you ? \" \" Oh, you mistake me\u2014 you mistake. I mean we are at peace, because the only three persons who have kept us in a turmoil of doubts and fears for so long are now no more.\" \" I comprehend you \u2014 but we may disnu'-\u00ab Jonathan Wild from the catalogue. I do not think that even had he lived he would have ever troubled me again.\" \"Captain! \" shouted Tom. \" The great gates are opened, and a party of the Light Horse are filing into the Court yard.\" Heron and his friends at once stepped into the recess of the window from which. Tom was making his observations. The inteUigence was but too true. A subaltern officer of the King's Light Horse was posting sentinels, so as to bar every ordinary mode of ingress or egress from the mansion. The danger was imminent \" Gentlemen, \" said Felix Heron, \" this con cerns me alone. Of course, nothing whatever will be attempted against either of you.\" \" Indeed, Whitcombe, we are not quite sure of that,\" said Trelawney. \" But if it be so,\" said the Marquis of Ormond, \"what then?\" . \"I am sure he would not,\" said Lady Castleneau. Heron held up his hand and listened. There was a sharp ringing at the gate of \" I beg of you to remain here until you hear .again from me \u2014 that is to say, unless you have imperative engagements elsewhere!\" \"No,\" cried the three gentlemen in a breath. Castleneau House. \" Visitors ! \" he said. \" I am still Captain Fantome, of the Royal Navy. See who is there, \" we can remain.\" Tom.\""], [418, "412 EDITH HERON. \" AU is well then, Tom ! \" \"Yes, Captain!\" \" Have Daisy ready saddled and bridled in the CHAPTER CCCSXI garden.\" \" Certainly, Captain.\", \" And tell Ogle to wait for mo by the old mulberry tree, near the south wall.\" \" It shall be done, Captain.\" \"Edith,\" said Heron, as he folded her in his arms for a moment \u2014 \" Edith, be strong and brave, and be assured that my enemies wfll not prevail over me. I have nothing now to fear but the villanous Clackington and the weak vengeance of this King, sick as he is in mind and body.\" Edith was much affected. THE REFUGE AT WARWICK HOUSE, AND THE ROYAL WARRANT. Heron paused for a moment to consider what it was best to do. \u2022 He held Daisy by the bridle, and then, having made up his mind, he vaulted into the saddle. He handed the key of the little door in the wall to Ogle, and signified by a sign that he was to open it. Ogle was not backward in obeying the in struction given to him, and flung the door wide open at once. But Heron had told her to be brave and strong. Daisy could not have got out without stoop ing, but a touch on the neck sufficed to let her know that she was to do so. \". Go,\" she said ; \" and may heaven's angels guard you!\" \" Forward !\" shouted Heron. With a rush, Daisy darted through the open doorway. \"Halt! you are my prisoner!\" cried a voice. \u25a0A mounted soldier was on duty precisely on the other side of the door. Heron snatched his hat from the chair on which he had laid it ; and proceeding to one of the windows of the breakfast-room, that opened to a low terrace facing the garden at the back of the house, he stepped out. \" Farewell !\" he said. \" I do not think the danger great ; but yet I will shun it, for I do Bot wish to have the lives of innocent men, who are but doing their duty, upon my hands.\" \" One moment, Whitcombe,\" cried the Earl of Bridgewater. \"Where shall we fkd you, should we wish to seek you ?\" \" At Warwick House.\" But FeUx Heron paid not the slightest atten tion to the summons. \"Forward!\" he .again shouted; and at that terrific gallop at which Daisy was unequalled, she sped with her rider over Bloomsbury Fields. The light horseman fired both his pistols after the fugitives, and started in pursuit, -but a dray horse might as well have pursued a hare, for Daisy leaped two fences, and then a wide ditch, and had disappeared before the eyes of the sentinel. \" Warwick House ?\" \" Yes ; I intend to ask the personal protec tion of the young Prince.\" \" It is wisely resolved.\" said Colonel Trelaw ney. \" Off with you at once, Whitcombe.\" Heron dropped from the balcony into the gar den. And now, Heron was determined to play a bold game, and to throw himseU fully and fairly upon the protection of the heir-apparent to the Crown. It was quite a wilderness of a place, that an cient garden of Castleneau House ; for among tbe many affections of the warm-hearted Lady Castleneau, one for trees was quite prominent. It is quite evident tbat the Prince, who had been brought up in such seclusion at Kew, had a friendly feeling towards Fehx Heron. The failing health of the King, his grand father, and the gusts of passion which frequently came over him, fuUy impressed aU tbe medical faculty of the kingdom with the idea that the de mise of the Crown, as it is technicaUy termed, would not bo far distant She would never suffer any lopping, or topping, or cuttings down of tbe magnificent old elms, sycamores, and poplars, that had adorned that garden for nearly a century. The consequence was. that it was picturesque and shadowy, being in places more like a wood than a garden. But no one knew every inch of it better than Felix Heron ; aud he rapidly made his way to wards the spot where he had appointed Ogle. to meet him. The consequence Was that the tide of Court sycophancy and flattery, had, of late, set strongly in the direction of that old red brick palace at Kew. i But the young monarch that was to be, had good advisers. Accident had made him acquainted with Colonel Trelawney, tbe Earl of Bridgewater, and the young Marquis of Ormond. There he found botli Ogle and Tom Ripon, and the latter led Daisy, fully accoutred for the road, by the bridle. The wall was tolerably high at that part of the .garden ; at least ten feet from the soil ; so that a leap of that height was out of the question- But there was a small, old, disused door in the thickness of the waU, the key of which Heron was provided with. .He was about to speak, when Ogle placed his finger on his lips, and pointed to the door. He then slipped up close to Heron, and whis pered to him. \" I'm quite certain there is sorno one on the other side of the door, either aa a spy or a Bcntinel.\" Those three gentlemen were neither place nor fortune-hunters. But they knew perfectly well those who were. They, consequently, were able to warn tho young Prince in regard to the character of those persons who sought bis intimacy. The intimacy that FeUx Heron had already had with Prince George, at Kew, had been quite (Sufficiently satisfactory to enable him to feel con- fident of such protection as the Prince could afford him. And now that Jonathan Wild was no moro."], [419, "EDITH HERON. 413 Now that even Lord Warringdale, had paid the penalty of his offences, and had fallen by the righteous sword of the Earl of Bridgewater. Now that John Tarleton was numbered with the dead, and, therefore, could no longer rise up as his foe, and a terror and a perplexity to Edith, Heron felt that the only person he had to do with was the King. And aided by the evil counsellors about him, that King, he knew, would destroy him even with the remnant of his own life, if possible. It was under these circumstances, then, that Heron determined to throw himself upon the protection of that young Prince who might al ready be said to have one foot upon the steps of the throne. Tho title was never questioned, and in two minutes Felix Heron was in the park, and had again mounted Daisy. A yeUing voice screamed after him \u2014 \" Stop him ! stop him ! a highwayman ! a highwayman !\" \"Guard! guard!\" cried another voice. There was a rattle of fire-arms, and a hasty tramp of feet. But it was too late. Heron had given Daisy one touch upon her 6ilken mane. With two bounds she was out of reach of pursuit, and in ten minutes more the iron gates of Warwick House had closed behind FeUx Heron and his horse. And now, almost for the first time in his life, or, at least, for a long period, Felix Heron de termined to throw off all disguise. Henceforth, he would appear as he reaUy was. \" I wish to see Mr. Granville.\" \" Certainly, sir ! Who shall we say ?\" \"' The Earl of Whitcombe.\" One of Prince George's grooms of the house hold, who had received Heron, bowed low. A peer of the realm. Another one approached and took Daisy by the bridle. \"Yes,\" he cried, \"I will be Earl of Whit combe now, and those who dispute my title, shall do so at the sword's point.\" As he spoke, he lifted his hat from his head and cast away the wig which so materiaUy helped to disguise him as Captain Fantome. He opened the lappels of the coat, which were buttoned across his chest, and he sat his horse in a different style and fashion. \" ShaU we walk tbe horse up and down, my Lord?\" \" I think not I shall probably stay with the Prince some time.\" \" Then we will put it into a staU, my Lord.\" \" If 3'ou please \u2014 yes.\" The servant was somewhat surprised at the manner in which Heron surrendered Daisy to him. It was by taking the bridle himself first, and then being careful to let Daisy see that he surrendered it into tbe hands of the man. He was once more the Felix Heron who had ridden so gallantly through the glades of Epping Forest and who has been so weU known to the reader for so lengthened a period. \" She is the geutlest creature alive,\" said Heron, \" but apt to be restive with perfect strangers. It will be all right now, though.\" Heron then followed the groom of tbe house hold into the interior of the building, and was soon introduced to Mr. Granville, who, had written that remarkable letter, which had, no doubt, saved Heron from capture at a critical moment, and been the real exciting cause of his seeking refuge at Warwick House. Mr. Granville looked at him with curiosity. \" You do not know me, sir,\" said Heron, \" but permit me to announce myself as that Felix Heron who claims to be Earl of Whitcombe ; and who has the happiness to enjoy the friendship of three gentlemen, to whose names he hopes ho may add a fourth, in yours.\" \" I know them weU,\" said Mr. Granville, with a smUe. \" You allude to our frionds Bridgewater, Ormond, and Trelawney.\" \" I do.\" And Daisy seemed to feel and know that some change had taken place. She arched her neck. She carried her head high. And so, at a sharp trot, although by no means a hasty one, Heron took his way through the heart of London to Warwick House, where the young Prince was staying. That ancient royal residence has now dis appeared. It was not very regal in its appointments or architecture, but it was generally in the occu pation of some member of the royal family. The nearest way to it was through St. James's Palace. That is to say, in at the great front gate, and out again by St. James's Park. It was not usual for horsemen to take that Toute, but a custom existed for peers of the realm, to dismount, and for one of the disengaged soldiers of the guard, to lead the horse through under the arched passage, and so into the park, while its rider walked. \" Then pray, my Lord Whitcombe, add me to the list as soon as possible, and be so good as to tell me in what I can be of servioe to you.\" \" I scarcely know, unless you cau afford me a refuge here at Warwick House, for I fancy His Majesty's Light Horse have some objections to my remaining anywhere else.\" \" I understand you, and will speak to the Prince at once. . Pray be seated, my Lord Whit combe.\" Heron was determined to assert his dignity. He guided Daisy right under the archway, and then deliberately dismounted. The sentinel then on duty there looked doubtful, but there was something so distinguished about the appearance of FeUx Heron, that he dreaded to commit himself by making some mistake. FeUx Heron was left alone, and strolling care lessly to a window of the apartment, which over looked the court-yard of Warwick House, he observed that there was some excitement going on in the park. People wero looking curiously about them. At the clatter of the horse's feet, a sergeant of the guard came from the guard-room. \" The Earl of Whitcombe,\" said Heron, \" lead the horse through.\" \" Yes, my Lord.\""], [420, "414 EDITH HERON. Several others were lounging against the trees, and all looking in a particular direction, as though somebody or something were approaching that attracted their curiosity. The opposite door of the room opened, and Prince George, in a plain morning dress, quietly walked into the room. \" What is all this\u2014 eh, Mr. Granville ?\" \" In the King's name I\" cried Clackington, again. Heron's ears were acute. In a few seconds ho heard the steady tramp of \" Silence, sir !\" said Mr. Granville. \" You have said that before, and you should be a suffi cient judge of etiquette to know that it is un mannerly to obtrude your voice when his Royal Highness the Prince asks a question of another.\" \" Then what is it all about ?\" asked the Prince, again. marching men. A whole company of the Foot Guards, with fixed bayonets, reached the exterior gates of War wick House. A rather tall, thin personage, in a court suit, accompanied the young subaltern officer, who, upon the spur of the moment, had had to take command of the company. It did not take a second glance from Felix Heron to ascertain who this person was. There was no mistaking the figure and face of Lord Clackington. He was gesticulating violently, and pointing towards Warwick House. \" My Lord Clackington, here,\" replied Mr. Granville, \" accompanied by this officer of the Guard, and a full company of his Majesty's household troops, urges the arrest of the Earl of Whitcombe, here.\" \" Indeed!\" \" Yes, and in the King's name !\" replied Clack ington. A sergeant of the company spoke some words to the Prince's porter on duty. Then Lord Clackington pushed him aside, and himself spoke. The porter bowed, and flung the gate o.pen. \"Eight face!\" cried the young subaltern. \"March!\" \" Silence, sir !\" added Mr. Granville. \" It is a well-known point of privilege with the heir apparent to the Crown that no nobleman or gen tleman of his household can be taken from be neath his roof on any writ of arrest whatever, provided he give his word for the security of that person.\" Mr. Granvflle looked very hard at the Prince as he spoke. The company marched into the court-yard. \"Halt!\" The young subaltern, with Lord Clackington, then ascended the steps of Warwick House, and disappeared into the mansion. That they came to attempt his arrest, of course, Felix Heron could not doubt for a moment. His Royal Highness was not particularly quick at apprehension, and for a few seconds he looked a little bewildered. Then what he had to do seemed to dawn upon him at once. He had been seen passing through the Palace by Lord Clackington, and this was the action he had taken in consequence. It remained to be seen, then, how far the power of the Prince would suffice for his pro tection. \" Certainly,\" he said, \u2014 \" certainly ! I shaU not aUow my Master of the Horse, the Earl of Whitcombe, to be interfered with in any way.\" \" Your Royal Highness's Master \u2014 of \u2014 tho \u2014 Horse !\" ejaculated Clackington. \"Exactly!\" said the Prince. \" Exactly !\" said Mr. Granville. Lord Clackington drew himself up. A baleful smile played upon his face. \" No man,\" he said, \" can possibly be moro eager than I, who have had the satisfaction and the honour of residing at the Court of St. James's the better part of my life, to support every usage and prerogative of royalty ; but \u2014 ha, ha ! \u2014 but \u2014but \" But Heron loosened his sword in its sheath, and although there might be just a heightened colour on his face, he determined that his capture, if, indeed, it did take place, should not be a calm, every-day affair. The door through which Mr. Granville had passed, however, suddenly opened again, and he re-entered the room. \" The Prince will be deUghted to see you, Lord Whitcombe.\" \u25a0' I am much beholden to his kindness. Bo pleased, Mr. Granvflle, to look out into the court yard.\" \" Ah !\" \" You are disrespectful, my Lord Clacking ton,\" said Mr. -GranviUe. \" Dont be making those hideous grimaces in the presence of his Royal Highness.\" \" But there is one exception to the privilege so justly claimed for the household of tho heir apparent, and that is when the charge is one of high treason, for which, in the name of the King, I arrest Felix Heron, calUng himself Earl of Whitcombe.\" \" You comprehend?\" \" I fancy I do. This is an attempt to capture you.\" \" It is. Lord Clackington, and the officer in command of that Guard, are already in the house.\" A sharp rap at the door by which Heron had entered that room, now announced an arrival. \" In tho King's name !\" shouted a voice. The door then was flung open, and Lord Clackington, foUowed by the officer of the Guard, appeared upon the threshold. Clackington hehl out a strip of paper, which trembled in his hand, as he shouted, hoarsely, \" In the King's name, I arrest that man, Felix Heron, calling himself Earl of Whitcombe !\" \" The Prince !\" said Mr. Granville. There was a death-like stfllness in the room. Clackington advanced a step. Tbe Prince laid his hand upon the arm ot Heron. \" Can nothing save him ?\" \"Nothing, your Royal Highness,\" replied Clackington, \u2014 \"nothing but the free pardon of the King himself, or the canct-Uing of this war rant under his own royal band.\" Heron placed his hand upon his sword-hilt. \" My Lord Clackington \""], [421, "415 EDITH HERON. \" Hush !\" said the Prince. \" What is that ?\" Boom ! came the sound of a gun from the Park. and tore it into fragments, to the great conster nation of Lord Clackington, who turned white and red by turns. \" And as for my Lord Clackington,\" added the Prince, \" whatever may be the faults and vices of persons in high places, it is those who basely pander to them for the greed of gain and the' lust of power, that are more to be reprehended.\" \" Your Majesty \" \" I am King of England, it appears, but I am not a despotic monarch; and therefore pronounce no sentence upon you \" \" Your Majesty \" \" But it wUl be a personal offence to us if ever we look upon your face again.\" Lord Clackington staggered out of the room, and disappeared from Warwick House. Boom ! went the lost gun in the Park. ***** Boom ! again. \" What does that mean, gentlemen ?\" The door of the room was flung open, and a man floundered in upon his knees. \" My name is Holt, your Gracious Majesty ! Permit me to be the first to congratulate you ! The King is dead \u2014 dead, your Majesty ! A fit, at Kensington Palace ! My name is Holt \u2014 Holt ! Always remember, your Majesty, that I was the first to have the honour \u2014 the pleasure \u2014 the de light of hailing your Majesty as King of Eng land!\" Boom ! came the guns again. Lord Clackington staggered back. A slight flush came over the face of the young King, for such we must now call him. Mr. Holt would have begun again his vocifera tions and slavish adulation, but Felix Heron 6tepped forward, and thrust him aside. \" SUence, sir !\" he said. \"This is no place for the presence, even, of such as you.\" But Holt was not to be silenced quite so easily. With the death of the King, who had shown such an implacable enmity against him, and likewise the extinction, either by death or dis persion, of aU those persons who bad endea voured to deprive him of tbat which was his right, Felix Heron had no difficulty in assuming his proper titles as Baron Warringdale and Earl of Whitcombe, and in stepping at once into pos session of the vast properties that went witipthe titles. His old patron was dead, and he was very much in want of a new one. \"Long live the King !\" he cried. \" I will be silenced by no one ! My heart is brimful of loyalty ! Long live the King !\" \" Silence, sir !\" This was a great mortification to many of tbe tenants on the Whitcombe estates, for find ing the disputes about the title, they had not only refused to pay rent to anybody, which pro bably they might fairly do \u2014 but they had as sumed a kind of proprietory over the various properties they held, and began to believe them their own. \" Long Uve his most gracious Majesty King George the Third ! This is a happy day \u2014 a most happy day !\" The young Prince bent his eyes upon Holt, and then he glanced at Felix Heron. \" My Lord Whitcombe,\" ho said, \" we think that man's presence is rather an intrusion.\" \" I have tbe honour,\" said Heron, \" to be en tirely of your Majesty's opinion.\" Then, as Heron spoke, he gave, for the first time in the presence of tbe young Sovereign one of those exhibitions of personal strength for which he was so remarkable. But now our tale is over, and the perils and adventures of FeUx Heron are at an end. It remains but to say a few brief words in re gard to those persons in whose future fate tbe reader may be supposed to be interested. Ogle, the faithful friend and foUower of -Felix Heron through so many perils and dangers, is still an inmate of the happy household of the Earl and Countess of Whitcombe. He Ufted Holt from the floor, and flung him bodily out at the door of the room. Tom Ripon and bis pretty wife are happy and contented in a picturesque-looking lodge on the Whitcombe estates, and Tom has been heard to declare that since he knows the happiness arising from a domestic life, that he has no desire to be come a Knight of the Road, as he once contem plated. The staircase was closo at hand, and by the rumbling sound which ensued, accompanied by tbe shouts of Mr. Holt, it was evident tbat he had found his way, in a manner more expeditious than pleasant, to the hall. And during this Uttle episode, the minute guns still continued firing in tho Park. Mortification and Mrs. Ripon have left the fence in Wardour Street, and being weU pro vided for by the Uberality of tbe Earl of Whit combe have become respectable and respected. And need we say that Fehx Heron \u2014 for once more must we give him tbat name by which he has been so long known and admired by tho reader, and his Edith wero happy ? There were shouts, and loud cries of felicita tion, in the court-yard of Warwick House. Then the doors were flung open which led to an adjoining room, which was considerably larger than that in which was Heron with the Prince. Several of the high officers of the State im mediately advanced, and among them was the Lord Chancellor, in his robes of office. \"I have to congratulate your Majesty,\" he said, \" upon your accession to the throne of England.\" \" Then, it is, indeed, true,\" said the Prince. \"My Lord Whitoombe, you remain a member of our household, and there is no warrant in ex istence for your apprehension.\" Tho Prince took the warrant from the table, Look at that happy fire-side.
